   LosAngeles -- From the White House to City Hall, officials
offered sympathy for the victims and outrage for the gunman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, our nation has been shaken and our hearts torn by
an act of gun violence,'' said President Clinton. ``To the victims
and their families, like all Americans, I offer our thoughts and
prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan toured the crime scene and was visibly
shaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sad day for the city of Los Angeles. This kind of
senseless crime can happen any place, but at this moment our
thoughts and our prayers have to reach out to the victims and the
families. I urge everybody to pray for the quick recovery of the
victims,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The state offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to
the capture of the gunman, while the Los Angeles City Council
offered $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not rest until whoever is responsible for this
unspeakable act of evil is brought to justice,'' said Gov. Gray
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he will form a security task force with
representatives from local, state and federal law enforcement
agencies to conduct safety audits on a voluntary basis at day-care
centers, churches, synagogues and community centers around the
state. State funds will be made available to those facilities to
beef up security.

COWBOYS FIND INTIMIDATION NO LONGER A DETERMINING FACTOR
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Dallas Cowboys, who haven't won a Super Bowl since the
``old'' Cleveland Browns were still in the league, found themselves
being reminded Monday night that respect in the NFL has a very
brief shelf life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do teams respect us the way they used to respect us? I don't
know that,'' wide receiver Michael Irvin said after the Cowboys
lost, 20-17, in overtime to the ``new'' Cleveland Browns in the Pro
Football Hall of Fame Game. ``If we win the Super Bowl, people
``should'' respect us again. Until then, they ``shouldn't'' ... and
I really can't blame them if they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   It's preseason. Scores don't count. Stats barely do. Little
matters aside from how young players look to coaches during what
ostensibly is a seven-week evaluation period between the opening of
training camp and the start of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night in Canton, Ohio, Browns fans woofed up a storm as
they packed Fawcett Stadium to watch their expansion darlings take
their first baby step without a hint of stage fright, without so
much as a modicum of fear for a Cowboys team that has won three
Super Bowls this decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I don't think anybody fears anybody in the NFL, I
really don't,'' Irvin added.
</P>
<P>
   The ``new'' Cleveland Browns have suited up and played 823 fewer
games than the Cowboys. But in this era of parity, free agency and
expansion benefits that come with paying $530 million in expansion
fees, the Browns were able to field a team Monday that, at times,
was more NFL-experienced than the one that lined up across from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, this (Cowboys) offense is going to be great,''
said quarterback Troy Aikman, who completed 9 of 11 passes for 85
yards in a scoreless quarter of play for Cowboys. ``(But) what
everyone has to understand is that we're not the same team we once
were.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone looks at me, Michael and Emmitt (Smith), and they
think that this is the same team. It really isn't. This is a
different team, and we have to be judged on our own merits.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman has been enthused with so many second- and third-team
players, on both sides of the ball, who have shown a capacity to
make big plays.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, the names are Jeff Ogden, Wane McGarity, MarTay
Jenkins and Tarik Smith; defensively, Peppi Zellner, Ebenezer
Ekuban, Dat Nguyen and Myron Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be more conscious about how I react with this
team,'' Aikman said. ``I have to be more understanding of where we
are (at this stage in preseason) and show a little more empathy
with these younger players who are still trying to find out what
the NFL is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Chan Gailey, meanwhile, has yet to win a game prior to Labor Day
as head coach of the Cowboys. His preseason record is 0-6.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Browns desperately wanted to win for their
football-starved fans, who had been without an NFL team since
December 1995 (Dallas won its last Super Bowl a month later),
Gailey and the Cowboys treated Canton simply as a test site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody comes out of these things feeling great when they
win, thinking how they have a great opportunity. That's a lot of
bull,'' Irvin said. ``Let's wait until the regular season starts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys came away from pro football's shrine feeling good
about their defensive quickness around the ball and the run
blocking/pass protection of the offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   On a shirt-sleeve summer night in Canton, Ohio, the Browns
weren't intimidated and the Cowboys weren't shocked by what
happened.
</P>
<P>
   But it's still preseason. nn

PAT SULLIVAN FEELS AT HOME WITH ALABAMA-BIRMINGHAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ He is back in coaching, but that doesn't
matter much to Pat Sullivan. He is back in coaching in his
hometown, and that matters the most.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, the new offensive coordinator at Alabama-Birmingham,
is returning to the sport that gave him his fame. Even though he
won the Heisman Trophy while playing for Auburn, Tigers fans aren't
giving him grief for being employed by the University of Alabama
system they love to hate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had any doubts I would get back into coaching,''
Sullivan said recently in UAB's modest football offices. ``It was
just a matter of where. After being around here, getting to know
the staff ... being from Birmingham, it was a natural fit. People
that know me know my family is important to me and I enjoy being
around my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a new grandfather. The 48-year-old Sullivan's first
grandchild, Joseph, is eight months old. His children _ Kim, Kelly
and Patrick _ also live in Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan took pride and satisfaction _ but not credit _ in TCU's
success last season because most of the players who contributed
were left over from his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of what we did at TCU,'' he said. ``We started out
with a small number of players, and our facilities needed a lot of
work. We got it all built up and had some success that was pretty
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first four seasons, Sullivan's Frogs beat Texas for the
first time in 25 years, had back-to-back winning seasons and went
to a bowl game. But when Louisiana State was searching for a coach
in 1995 and Sullivan showed his interest, his fairy tale as the
Frog Prince turned nasty. TCU fans felt betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you sit back and reflect, the LSU situation had more
impact than I ever thought it would,'' said Sullivan, the 1971
Heisman Trophy winner. ``And there were various reasons. I burned
some bridges, unintentionally, with TCU people. And from a football
standpoint, it hurt recruiting for a year or two.''
</P>
<P>
   That was reflected in his 1-10 record during his final year with
the Frogs when, Sullivan points out, two-thirds of the players who
suited up each week were freshmen or red-shirt freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   The lost 1997 season came on the heels of a public-relations
disaster. Four TCU players, including starting center Ryan Tucker,
were involved in an assault of a former TCU student outside a Fort
Worth bar. Sullivan and TCU's administration allowed the players to
continue playing while the court case was pending. Tucker pleaded
no contest to aggravated assault charges along with two other
players, and the fourth was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a lot of heat for standing behind (those players),''
said Sullivan, 24-42-1 at TCU. ``And I'd do it again given the same
circumstances. Those decisions were made by (former athletic
director Frank Windegger) and (former chancellor William Tucker)
also. We never dreamed it would drag on as long as it did.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said he had some coaching offers that didn't spark his
interest, and he spent last season as a college football spectator.
As the Horned Frogs turned in an inspiring 7-5 season under coach
Dennis Franchione, Sullivan spent some Saturdays hunkered down in
front of the television, watching every college game he could.
Other Saturdays, he wouldn't watch any.
</P>
<P>
   He also attended a number of UAB's practices and traveled to
Alabama and Mississippi to watch practices there. He spoke at
Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer's high school coaching clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, when I left I needed a break,'' Sullivan said of
his year off. ``The first couple of months I enjoyed being back
here, being around the kids, family. But when spring practice
rolled around, the honey dos and the golf ... the itch of wanting
to get back involved was there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to just break away from athletics. I think Mike
Singletary described it best when he said the thing you cherish and
then miss the most are the relationships. Those last for a
lifetime. I missed working with the players and camaraderie of the
coaching staff. I missed all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan's new boss is an old friend. UAB coach Watson Brown,
the brother of Texas coach Mack Brown, helped make Sullivan's
decision to join the Blazers' staff that much easier. And Watson
Brown knows what it's like to try to climb the coaching ladder a
second time. After being fired as Vanderbilt's coach in 1990, he
was an assistant coach at Mississippi State and Oklahoma before
taking the UAB job.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only concern was whether he would want to do this,'' he
said of hiring Sullivan. ``As soon as I felt good about that, I was
fine with it. Some guys go back and try to be an assistant, and it
doesn't work. It's all in your attitude and the way you approach
it. Pat's not on an ego trip. I think he really wants to fit in. I
felt that when we talked, and that's the reason I hired him.''
</P>
<P>
   Alabama-Birmingham has never won more than five games in a
season since moving to Division I-A four years ago. This season,
the Blazers make their debut as a member of Conference USA. UAB
opens the season at Missouri and then plays at Virginia Tech; the
Blazers have been shut out the past two seasons by the Hokies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're dealing with more Xs and Os as a coordinator, game
planning and that stuff instead of all the other stuff,'' Sullivan
said. ``That's fun. That's what's enjoyable about what I'm doing. I
like our team. Nobody gives us a chance. Nobody gave us a chance
that first year against Texas, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan says his main goal is helping Brown build UAB into a
conference champion. He likens the Blazers' situation to the one he
inherited at TCU. And, if like Brown, his work as an offensive
coordinator helps him get another shot at being a head coach, so be
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to sit here and say I don't want to be a head
coach again,'' Sullivan said. ``I know I can do the job and I felt
like I was good at it. I'm not consumed with getting back to being
a head coach. I'm very content and happy to be right here. You
never know what will happen in six months or a year. I won't take a
job just to take a job. nn

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the latest in a string of seemingly
inexplicable shootings, a balding, white, middle-aged man walked
into a Jewish community center in the middle-class neighborhood of
Granada Hills on Tuesday morning and shot five people, including
three young boys at a day camp, then fled.
</P>
<P>
   A 3{-year-old boy who said he was just a few feet from the
shooting _ his mother would only give his name as Eric _ said the
man had said nothing before fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad monster ran away,'' said the boy, who clung to his
mother and asked her if any of the wounded children had done
anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the victims were said to be in good condition and
were expected to be released soon from local hospitals, but a
5-year-old boy, who had been shot in the abdomen, was said to be in
critical condition after undergoing surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The police searched a square-mile area around the North Valley
Jewish Community Center for the gunman, who fired as many as 30
shots with an automatic or semiautomatic 9-millimeter handgun,
officials said. The gunman was described as about 40.
</P>
<P>
   As officers searched the neighborhood, they asked residents to
remain indoors while the search continued.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the afternoon, Comdr. David Kalish of the Los Angeles
Police Department said officers had searched a red van, with
Washington state license plates, about two miles away, near the Van
Nuys Airport and had found ``an incredible amount of ammunition,''
a bulletproof vest and ``substantial other evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Kalish also said that at about noon there had been a carjacking
in which a white male who generally matched the description of the
suspect in the shooting had stolen a dark green 1999 Toyota
Corolla.
</P>
<P>
   The police later said that the van's driver was the same man who
had stolen the car at gunpoint, and that they had been led to the
van while investigating the theft.
</P>
<P>
   In the early evening, the Toyota was found by officers several
miles away at a hotel that the police then surrounded.
</P>
<P>
   Within 30 minutes of the shooting, at about 10:45 a.m.,
helicopter crews from local television stations broadcast images of
police officers leading children out of the center, hand in hand in
strings of five, six and seven. Firefighters and paramedics at the
scene said the children had been orderly, though upset.
</P>
<P>
   But as the area was being searched, the police lines at the
community center quickly became jammed with parents waiting
anxiously to hear about their children, neighbors stunned by the
violence so near their homes and scores of reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents were reunited with their children in the street,
and they frequently stayed in the area, hugging their children,
chatting with friends and other parents, so mystified by the
violence that they seemed unconcerned that the shooter could still
be in the neighborhood. The Fire Department brought a cooler of
drinks for the parents around mid-day as they waited for word of
their children.
</P>
<P>
   Lucille Shalometh Goldin was quoted by the City News Service as
saying that her mother, Isabelle Shalometh, a receptionist at the
center, had been slightly wounded in the arm and back.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said a young man, a ruffian, she saw him coming at her and
I guess he just started open firing,'' Ms. Goldin said, ``and she
knew enough to quickly duck down and she did.''
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Steve Ruda of the Fire Department said that in addition to
Ms. Shalometh, 68, a 16-year-girl was shot in the right thigh and
shin, a 6-year-old boy was wounded in the left foot and another
6-year-old boy was shot in the left leg and left hip. The most
serious injuries were to the 5-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the gunman was about 5 foot 8 to 5 foot 10,
weighed about 170 pounds and was dressed in green clothing.
</P>
<P>
   They said he had apparently fled west on Rinaldi Street, at
least initially on foot, and then disappeared. A SWAT team
conducted house to house searches with dogs. In addition, the FBI
and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms sent teams to the
residential area, in the San Fernando Valley about 30 miles
northwest of downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The images of armed officers searching alleys, sheds and homes,
of anxious parents and fleeing children were broadcast for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Because the incident followed what has been a string of
shootings in recent months, and comes in the middle of an intense
debate over the availability of firearms, it was followed closely
by officials across the state and in Washington. President Clinton
said, ``Once again our nation has been shaken and our hearts torn''
by what he called ``another senseless act of gun violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis of California said, ``Once again, we have been
shocked, saddened and outraged by an act of vicious gun violence
aimed against defenseless children and innocent adults.'' He
offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to an arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were treated at the site and then taken to local
hospitals, some by ambulance and some by helicopter. The police
focused on getting the children organized and calm, and reuniting
them with their parents, who began to show up about noon.
</P>
<P>
   The North Valley Jewish Community Center, like similar Jewish
centers throughout the country, is not a place of worship, but an
educational and recreation site serving people of all ages.

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
ATLANTA _ Any analysis of Tuesday night's game at Turner Field
should begin with a play the Braves made and end with two the
Astros botched.
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no margin for error in the late innings of a tie game,
particularly against a good team, which is why the outcome was
somewhat predictable after the Astros committed a couple of costly
seventh-inning errors. The Braves capitalized, with Bret Boone's
two-run double in the seventh the game-winning hit in a 6-4 Atlanta
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the game, Braves center fielder Andruw Jones robbed
the Astros of at least one run _ probably two _ by catching a
scorcher toward the gap off Derek Bell's bat. It ended up being a
sacrifice fly, scoring just one run for the Astros, who viewed that
play as a pivotal part of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best center fielder in the game,'' Astros second
baseman Craig Biggio said of Jones. ``If the ball stays in the
park, he's going to run it down. To me, that was the biggest play
of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Some might argue the biggest plays of the game occurred in the
bottom of the seventh inning, which began with a ground ball going
through Astros shortstop Ricky Gutierrez's legs and also included a
throwing error by third baseman Russ Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   That set the stage for Boone's heroics and turned a tie game
into an eventual Braves victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both looked like routine plays from where I was sitting,''
Astros manager Larry Dierker said. ``When you get four runs off Tom
Glavine, you have to find a way to beat these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine didn't necessarily outpitch Astros starter Shane
Reynolds, but he kept the ball in the park, and his team supported
him with better defense. Reynolds was victimized by three home runs
_ two in the first inning _ and abandoned by his defense in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just booted it,'' said Gutierrez, playing in his first game
since being activated from the disabled list. ``I should have
caught it. It was pretty routine; that ball wasn't difficult. If I
make that play, it's a different inning. That got everything going.
Shane battled. He had a rough first inning, but he kept us in the
game, and I let him down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros dropped their second game in a row, allowing
second-place Cincinnati to move within a game of first place in the
National League Central. The Reds defeated Pittsburgh on Tuesday
night, marking the first time the Astros' lead has dipped below 1{
games since July 15.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, who had allowed only one earned run in his last 24
innings coming in, served up home-run balls to Chipper Jones, Ryan
Klesko and Boone, who was 2-for-4 and tied a season high with four
RBIs. Reynolds retired 13 of the next 16 batters he faced after the
two first-inning homers, but too much damage already had been done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just made some bad pitches,'' said Reynolds (14-8), whose
personal winning streak was snapped at three games. ``I got into a
groove and got some guys out after a while, but I didn't do my job
at all. You get down to a team like that, and it's hard to come
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Back-to-back homers by Boone and Chipper Jones on consecutive
pitches gave the Braves a 3-0 lead after one inning. Jones followed
Boone's two-run blast into the left-field seats with a solo shot of
his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were just terrible pitches, horrible,'' Reynolds said.
``They hit them hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros catcher Randy Knorr led off the third inning with a
double, moved to third on a well-placed sacrifice bunt by Reynolds
and scored on Biggio's sacrifice fly to center, which pulled the
Astros within two.
</P>
<P>
   An error by Braves shortstop Jose Hernandez helped the Astros
take the lead with a big inning in the fifth. With runners on first
and second and one out, Biggio hit a ground ball back to the mound,
and Glavine fired toward second to start an apparent double play.
But Hernandez missed second base with his foot, and his throw to
first base wasn't in time to nab Biggio.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez drove in a run with an infield single, and Jeff
Bagwell drew a bases-loaded walk for his first RBI since Aug. 1.
Bell's sacrifice fly to center then gave the Astros a 4-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's blast might have scored at least one more run if anyone
other than Andruw Jones had been playing center field. As he has
done a few times in the first two games of the series, Jones robbed
an Astro of extra bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you can do is shake your head,'' Bell said. ``I don't give
a damn what anyone says; he's the best center fielder in baseball.
He's saved them three or four runs in this series alone. When I hit
that ball, I just knew it was a double. I thought two or three runs
might score on that ball. He's unbelievable out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros didn't hold the lead for long. Klesko's home run off
Reynolds tied the score at 4 in the sixth, and the Braves took the
lead in the seventh on Boone's two-run double.

COWBOYS' LACEWELL HITS DRAFT PAYDIRT
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Larry Lacewell taught Miami Dolphins
coach Jimmy Johnson more about football than anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   How do I know?
</P>
<P>
   Johnson says so in his book.
</P>
<P>
   And Lacewell, 63, will tell you if you talk to him long enough.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, however, Lacewell's many stories about his
football experiences were what he was mostly associated with.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly wasn't the draft prowess of the Dallas Cowboys'
scouting department, which he has headed since 1994 or AJL (After
Jimmy left).
</P>
<P>
   Early ``jewels'' like Shante Carver, George Hegamin, Shane
Hannah and Clay Shiver took the phrase ``can miss'' prospects to
new heights.
</P>
<P>
   But new respect seems to be in order for Lacewell and his
department. Their stamp was all over most of the positive
performances that came out of Monday's 20-17 overtime preseason
loss to the Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   As Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said, the preseason opener was
about seeing as many guys as you can. And the first game-action
glimpses of the Cowboys' 1999 draft class was quite pleasing to the
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   All seven draft picks _ save for the injured Kelvin Garmon _
made plays in the game, highly noticeable plays like the smashing
sacks by defensive end Ebenezer Ekuban (first round) and linebacker
Dat Nguyen (third round).
</P>
<P>
   There was wide receiver Wane McGarity (fourth round) making a
fingertip catch to keep a scoring drive going. And there was
receiver MarTay Jenkins (sixth round) capping it with a 35-yard
catch-and-run for the touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   And a few more games like Monday from offensive guard Solomon
Page (second round), who blended well with the first unit, and it
may tough get him out of the lineup. Fourth-round defensive end
Peppi Zellner's play already has the coaches in the nice bind of
trying to find playing time for too many ends. That's called depth,
which has not been heard of around here in a while.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, this is the third consecutive solid draft class for
Lacewell and the Cowboys; 1997's group included starters David
LaFleur and Dexter Coakley and last year's bunch brought starters
Greg Ellis, Flozell Adams and Michael Myers.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 brood, however, should have the most immediate impact
as Ekuban, Page, Nguyen, McGarity and Zellner could all earn solid
playing time as rookies.
</P>
<P>
   And it all should make for another great Lacewell story. COWBOYS
AND THE HALL OF FAME
</P>
<P>
   There might be no questioning the Cowboys' popularity and their
status as America's Team.
</P>
<P>
   What does need questioning, however, is the low number of
Cowboys players in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Of course,
current greats Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith and Deion Sanders are
certain to be enshrined once their careers end. With Lawrence
Taylor in, Michael Irvin should be honored as well.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the players that helped build the franchise? The
Cowboys put together a streak of 20 consecutive winning seasons
from 1966 thorough 1985, the third-longest in professional sports
history. During that time they won two Super Bowls, five conference
titles and 13 division titles.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, only five players from that era _ Bob Lilly, Tony Dorsett,
Mel Renfro, Roger Staubach and Randy White _ have their busts in
Canton.
</P>
<P>
   The list of worthy candidates is long, but topping it are Drew
Pearson, Don Perkins, Chuck Howley, Rayfield Wright, Cliff Harris,
Lee Roy Jordan and Everson Walls. COWBOYS AND SPEED
</P>
<P>
   The sight (blurr) of Jenkins sprinting into the end zone Monday
shouldn't have been a surprise; he is the second-fastest player on
the team. His time of 4.27 seconds in the 40-yard dash trails only
cornerback Kevin Mathis' time of 4.23.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, cornerback Deion Sanders hasn't been timed since he
was a rookie, but he says he does 4.2 for breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Considering our brush with past greats over the weekend, the
question is how would they rank with Mathis, Sanders and Jenkins,
speedwise.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Cowboys Hall of Fame cornerback Mel Renfro would be eating
cereal with Sanders, as he matter-of-factly stated that he ran a
4.2 40 during his prime.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Fame receiver Paul Warfield, who is consulting with the
Cowboys, has another take. He said that players during his era were
often timed wearing their full football uniforms and on grass
instead of the nice rubber tracks that the Cowboys are timed on
today. With that in mind, Warfield said his 4.5 time would easily
drop to 4.3.

MATEO KEEPING IN SHAPE FOR POSSIBLE RETURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Ruben Mateo was in center field Tuesday,
showing off his strong right arm.
</P>
<P>
   He was not, however, gunning down Detroit base runners during
the game. The Rangers' young outfielder was playing catch with
trainer Ray Ramirez before batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old once again became the center fielder of the
future, rather than the present, when he broke the hamate bone in
his left wrist Aug. 4. He underwent surgery to remove the bone, and
is working to stay in shape in case he recovers in time to play the
last week or two of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking my time, trying to be strong for when I come
back,'' Mateo said. ``I have to work and stay in shape.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a routine that Mateo is all too familiar with. This is his
fifth injury in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   He was on the disabled list from June 23-July 9 this season
because of a strained groin. In April, 1998, he dislocated a
shoulder diving for a ball while at Double-A Tulsa, and missed a
month. He played six games for Escogido in the Dominican Republic
in winter ball, then injured his right hamstring. And he sprained
his right wrist while playing for Class-A Charlotte in August,
1997, and missed the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Players who get hurt that frequently tend to get an ``injury
prone'' label stuck on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about it that way,'' Mateo said. ``It's
something that can happen to anyone. Nobody has control over that.
I'm trying to be healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the frequency of injuries, no one with the Rangers is
overly concerned that the player expected to be the regular center
fielder next season and a future star might be injury-prone.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, there's the freakish nature of the latest injury.
Mateo broke the bone while swinging at a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   He strained his groin in June when lunging for first base while
trying to beat out a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a guy's stretching, putting his body beyond the normal
range of motion, he's susceptible,'' said Tim Lang, the club's
conditioning coach.
</P>
<P>
   The dislocated shoulder last year also happened because Mateo
was playing hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an aggressive player, and any time you're aggressive
things can happen on the field,'' Ramirez said.
</P>
<P>
   The other injuries, Lang suggested, could merely be a product of
his age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ruben is a young 21-year-old,'' Lang said. ``I think his body
hasn't matured yet. I think his bones are still growing. He's very
strong, but he's young. He may be too strong for his body structure
at this point in time. I think some of those injuries will be
alleviated simply because he's going to mature and his body's going
to catch up. Down the road it shouldn't be a factor. I wouldn't
label him as injury prone.'' nn

FORT WORTH GOLFER MAKING NAME, MONEY ACROSS POND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A funny thing has happened to John Grace in his quest to earn
staying power on the Senior PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth resident has played himself into position to
become one of the top money winners in Europe. As such, the
51-year-old could find himself playing as many as a dozen events on
the other side of the Atlantic Ocean next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``My end goal is to play the U.S. (Senior) tour. But if things
don't fall into place here (in the United States), I can see
that,'' Grace said of a 2000 schedule that would be dotted heavily
with overseas appearances. ``I want to keep all my options open. A
month ago, I'd never even entered one of their tournaments. Now,
I'm talking about trying to stay in the top 50 on their money list.
It's a crazy game.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been an eventful month for Grace, a real-estate developer
who will spend the next three weeks trying to earn Monday
qualifying spots at Senior Tour events. The seed money for those
trips was generated in Europe, where Grace competed on sponsor's
exemptions at the British Senior Open and the Energis Senior
Masters. He finished 12th and seventh respectively, and pocketed
enough money ($20,500) to climb to 38th on the European Senior Tour
money list.
</P>
<P>
   Grace did well enough that he's contemplating a trip to the
European Senior PGA Championship at the end of August to protect a
top-50 finish on the 1999 money list. By doing so, he would be
exempted for 90 percent of the 23 tournaments on the 2000 European
calendar. Yet in the United States, Grace remains a Monday
qualifier who rarely gets the opportunity to improve his 93rd spot
on the Senior Tour money list ($23,803).
</P>
<P>
   A notable amateur player who turned professional in 1998, Grace
landed a sponsor's exemption into the British Senior Open largely
because of name recognition from his participation in the 1975
Walker Cup. After finishing 12th, he was invited to stay and play
in the Senior Masters. His seventh-place finish there ranks as his
best on one of the world's two most prestigious 50-and-older tours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need somewhere to play regularly against good competition,''
Grace said. ``Europe hadn't been on the front burner. But it is
now.''
SPOTLIGHT ON
LEHMAN, HOCH STRONG CHOICES FOR RYDER TEAM
</P>
<P>
   Memo to Ben Crenshaw, U.S. Ryder Cup captain:
</P>
<P>
   Be sure and thank Tom Lehman during the PGA Championship this
week for taking over the No. 11 spot in the Ryder Cup standings
with a runner-up finish Sunday at the Buick Open. He's everything
you could want in a captain's choice candidate to fit The Country
Club layout in Brookline, Mass.: A tough-minded guy with a proven
Ryder Cup record (3-2-2) who is playing well and owns a stellar
record in the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Lehman cracks the top 10 and earns an automatic berth
with a strong showing at the PGA, he makes one of Crenshaw's
at-large picks a no-brainer. Every Ryder Cup captain should be so
lucky.
</P>
<P>
   The other spot, alas, will require inspiration. That's where we
come in.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the points standings, Ben, and go with your gut. Because
your team will be competing on a prototype Open course, you need a
prototype Open player. You've all but said so yourself. That means
you need to watch two guys very closely at the PGA Championship at
Medinah (Ill.) Country Club: Lee Janzen and Scott Hoch.
</P>
<P>
   Unless there's a massive reshuffle in the standings, pick the
one with the better finish at the PGA as your at-large choice to
join Lehman. Janzen has won two Opens. Hoch has five top-10s at the
Open this decade and, even better, is unbeaten (2-0-1) in Ryder Cup
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, Hoch was the top American point scorer in the 1997 Ryder
Cup (21/2 points). He has played well at Brookline and has had a
quiet but decent season in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably leading the tour in 12th-place finishes, which
won't get you anything,'' said Hoch, who finished 25th at the Buick
Open last week. ``I talked to Ben and he told me, `That course is
perfect for you.' I agree. I like match play and I think I could be
an asset to the team, especially on that course.''
</P>
<P>
   No argument here.
CHIP SHOTS STRONG START FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Bob Burris, tournament director of the inaugural Bank One
Championship, said he expects ``at least 45'' of the top 50 money
winners on the Senior Tour to take part in Fort Worth-Dallas'
newest event when the tour visits Bent Tree Country Club in Dallas
on Sept. 17-19. The commitment list includes rookie Tom Watson as
well as Dallas residents Lee Trevino and David Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only (high-profile player) who I know isn't coming is Gary
Player. He's got another commitment,'' Burris said. ``Everyone I
talk to seems fired up to be headed back to Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   Commitment deadline for the tournament is Sept. 10. The area has
not played host to a Senior Tour event since 1995. FUTURE DATES IN
FLUX
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the 2001 season, the Bank One Championship could
shift its playing dates to October. Burris said he is exploring the
possibility of having the event serve as the prelude to the
season-ending Senior Tour Championship, which features the top 31
money winners.
</P>
<P>
   Placed in that position on the Senior Tour calendar, the Bank
One event would be certain to attract plenty of players seeking to
secure spots in the season's final tournament. But those golfers
already guaranteed berths in the Senior Tour Championship might be
tempted to bypass the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to look at the fields from tournaments that have been
in that spot in the past and see how well they did (attracting
big-name players) before we go any farther,'' Burris said. ``But
it's something we're looking at. The weather here in October would
be ideal.''
</P>
<P>
   The event will remain in its September slot on the 2000 Senior
Tour calendar. TEXAS TOUCH AT RYDER CUP
</P>
<P>
   Paul Milosevich, a Lubbock resident, has been commissioned to
paint the 1999 U.S. Ryder Cup team portrait. Milosevich, a former
art instructor at Texas Tech, has painted several portraits for Ben
Crenshaw, the U.S. Ryder Cup captain. In addition, his work was
used as set decorations in the movie Tin Cup. nn

GROUP FROM DAY CAMP AT TOLERANCE MUSEUM DURING ATTACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DOUGLAS HABERMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- As 20 teen-agers toured the Museum of Tolerance
on Tuesday and learned about the horrors that humans have inflicted
on one another through the ages, they didn't know their day camp at
the North Valley Jewish Community Center had become the scene of
one more such horror.
</P>
<P>
   ``While they were learning about man's inhumanity to man, that
inhumanity was knocking at their door,'' said Rabbi Marvin Hier,
dean and founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in West Los Angeles
where the museum is located.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the museum staff learned of the shootings from radio
news reports and alerted the day camp's program director, who was
on the tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was emotionally overwhelmed,'' he said. The program
director, whom Hier identified only as Amy, fielded calls from
parents of children on the tour, telling the callers their children
were on the tour when the gunman struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every parent who called, we were only too happy to say:
Yes, your child is here,'' said museum director Liebe Geft.
</P>
<P>
   But to the families of the victims, Hier said, ``We have to
express our sorrow. Their pain is unimaginable.''
</P>
<P>
   Museum staffers decided to cut the children's visit short by 20
minutes, Geft and Hier said, to get them back to their families
sooner.
</P>
<P>
   The teens were told of the shootings only after they boarded
buses for the return trip to the San Fernando Valley, to limit the
anxiety they might experience before the long ride back to Granada
Hills, Hier said.
</P>
<P>
   Geft said the students visited the museum and then took part in
a discussion that centered on how many more good people there are
in the world than bad people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a very sad commentary on our society when we have
to guard day camps like international points of entry,'' said Geft.

EVEN RED-HOT PUDGE CAN'T ELUDE TEXAS HEAT (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ It's August in Arlington, and Pudge Rodriguez
is winning all his battles except one. This one, he already
concedes, won't be won.
</P>
<P>
   Which is kinda strange, everything considered.
</P>
<P>
   Is there an opposing pitcher Pudge can't tatoo? None lately.
Baseball's hottest roll continued last night with a three-run home
run by Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Base runners, as always, fear his arm. The manager in the other
dugout changes his strategy out of respect for arm and instinct.
Even Texas Rangers hurlers have been bragging the past couple of
weeks about Pudge's pitch calls, not always considered a strength.
</P>
<P>
   With everything going so right, then what's the negative looming
out there on the immediate horizon?
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't beat this heat, not when it's 100 degrees day after
day,'' said Rodriguez, matter-of-factly. ``I don't surrender to it.
I've never worked harder or felt stronger in my career. But it
won't matter. I'm human. The heat will wear me down by September.
All of us will feel it sooner or later.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome, friends, to the annual Arlington blast furnance, where
even the strongest of men are eventually french-fried. Around here,
it's a tradition of summer.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was the 14th consecutive day for 100-plus degrees,
hitting a summer high of 106. The streak goes to 15 Wednesday.
After a mild (by local standards) summer, the century-mark stampede
arrived in late July, almost coinciding with the longest homestand
of the season for the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   There has long been a theory, disputed by me, that all Rangers
teams have begun to wear down around the 110-game mark, sapped by
the relentless heat. But in the marathon that is a baseball season,
the 110-game mark usually seperates contenders from the rest. To
me, most Rangers teams through the years have had a manpower
shortage instead of a heat meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Palmeiro spent five years in Texas, left for five years,
and now he's back, sweating it out. ``The heat will wear you
down,'' he said, ``but I also know in my previous time here we
didn't have the horses to play consistently well for a full season.
With this team, we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro was one of several players consulted when the Rangers
decided to alter their pregame work during August. Like mostly
indoor stretching and batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the game starts, you forget about the heat,'' Palmeiro
said. ``But I think we were smart to change how we handle the stuff
leading up to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   As the catcher, Rodriguez has the hottest summer job in town.
Plus, he begs for a heavy workload throughout the season. During
this blowtorch of a homestand, he has had six homers and 21 runs
batted in in 11 games while hitting over .450. No sign of a slide
thus far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can truthfully say I've never seen anyone who loves to play
baseball more than Pudge,'' manager Johnny Oates said. ``At first I
didn't understand it. But the more I got to know Pudge, the more I
realized his passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Last night it had ``cooled off'' to 99 degrees when the first
pitch was delivered to Rodriguez at 7:36 p.m. ``Being from Puerto
Rico, I thought I knew about heat,'' said Rodriguez, smiling.
``Then I came to Texas. Now I really know about heat.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight years into what appears to be a future Hall of Fame
career, Rodriguez is having his best overall season. Which
coincides with Pudge finally honoring the Rangers' request to cease
with winter ball in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, that has helped me stay stronger for a longer
period,'' he said. ``By not playing in the winter I spent the
off-season doing my full workout program _ the first time I've had
time for the full program.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, several scouts from other teams were commenting on
Rodriguez's physical condition, believing he was playing at a lower
weight from several months ago. ``No, the weight is the same,'' he
said, ``it's my body fat that is lower than ever. That's from a lot
of working out in the morning and a very healthy diet.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Pudge's respect for the pounding Texas heat still has him
preparing for personal fatigue by September.
</P>
<P>
   ``My plan is to meet it head on by working through it and
bouncing back strong,'' he said. ``The worst thing you can do is
not be prepared. That's when the heat can bury you.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers players through the years claim to know that
burial-by-sun feeling. So have many local teams. The blistering
verdict on this current edition is still out. nn

WILL ANGELS' COACHES BE BACK?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Among the decisions that need to be made following
this season involves the coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Terry Collins, who had his contract extended for two
years in June, selected the current group of coaches and has
praised them all season.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision on who stays and who goes may not be his.
</P>
<P>
   In a radio interview on the Angels' station KLAC last week,
Angels president Tony Tavares was asked who is responsible for the
team's failure, the players or the coaches?
</P>
<P>
   Said Tavares: ``(Players) have been talked to individually.
They've been talked to as a team. It seems like people aren't
getting through to them right now. That's either the fault of the
teachers or the people who are communicating. That's one
possibility. Or it's the fault of the players because they're not
listening. Or maybe it's a combination of both. That's the kind of
thing we have to look at in the offseason. We'll leave no stone
unturned.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said when he managed in Houston he had an owner who told
him which coaches could stay and which ones would go. But until he
is told otherwise, Collins said he believes the decision is still
his.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be (his decision),'' Collins said. ``When the season's
over we'll evaluate everyone and determine where we're at. And
that's when decisions will be made.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins' coaches include third base coach Larry Bowa, in his
third season with the club; hitting coach Rod Carew, in his eighth
season; pitching coach Dick Pole, in his first season; bench coach
Joe Maddon, in his sixth season; first base coach George Hendrick,
in his second season; bullpen coach Joe Coleman, in his sixth
season; and bullpen catcher Mick Billmeyer, in his sixth season.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn returned to the lineup Tuesday for the first time in a
week having recovered from a staph infection in his right shin. He
served as the DH.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got enough things out of the way now for the next seven
years,'' Vaughn said. ``It was like I was poisoned. It felt like I
was losing my motor skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn believes the infection developed after he fouled a pitch
off his shin.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Mike James began has moved on from single-A Lake
Elsinore to triple-A Edmonton on his rehab assignment. He is
expected to be there at least a week before being activated. ...
Outfielder Matt Luke sustained another setback, injuring his back
while on his rehab assignment at Lake Elsinore. He began the rehab
assignment after pulling a muscle in his side, then injured his
wrist. Now it's his back. There is no timetable for his return.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels and Indians play the final game of their three-game
series tonight at 7:35. Steve Sparks (5-8, 4.88 ERA) will start for
Anaheim against Cleveland's Dave Burba (8-7, 4.90).

   LOS ANGELES: playing the piano.''
</P>
<P>
   With no suspect in custody and no apparent motive, parents and
employees struggled to understand why anyone would just randomly
open fire on a building full of children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just so unbelievable,'' said Laurel Wolf, a former
teacher at the Jewish Community Center who lives nearby. ``Why? Why
would somebody be so crazy to do this? It's frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   SWAT team officers with dogs methodically searched the
neighborhood, sweeping through buildings and back yards with their
guns pointed forward.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the confusion were conflicting descriptions of the
gunmen from witnesses shaken by the experience. Police first
thought the suspect was a teen-ager, but then described him as a
40-year-old white man who is bald and wearing green or black
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes after the shooting, a man fitting the gunman's
description hijacked a car near Van Nuys Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The man pulled the woman out of her car at Roscoe Boulevard and
Woodley Avenue, stole her car, and left her and the van behind,
police said. The van held some 5,000 rounds of 9 mm ammunition, a
flak jacket, a smoke grenade and survival gear.
</P>
<P>
   About 5:30 p.m., police found the Corolla outside the 7-Star
Suites Hotel in Chatsworth. Special weapons and tactics team
officers cordoned off the area in the belief that he was barricaded
in a room.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish Community Center runs a summer day-care program, a
camp and a preschool, with roughly 300 children in the building on
a typical day, according to executive director Jeff Rouss.
Twenty-two children were away on a field trip.
</P>
<P>
   Rouss said they had no warning that something like this would
happen, and it has prompted Jewish Community Centers throughout the
region to re-evaluate their security measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so sad what happened here today,'' Rouss said. ``We're a
place of fun and recreation and learning and caring.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parents and an official of the Anti-Defamation League said
they previously had some doubts about the center's security.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always telling people that we need more security at that
building,'' said Aaron Levinson, director of the ADL's Valley
office.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin, the daughter of the 68-year-old receptionist, said the
Jewish center is a popular family gathering spot for classes,
programs and other activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't go to the Jewish center and be safe, where can
you go and be safe anymore? There's nowhere.''

SHATNER'S WIFE DEAD IN POOL 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hours after finding his wife dead at the bottom of
the couple's swimming pool, actor William Shatner emerged from
their gated home Tuesday and tearfully expressed his grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``My beautiful wife is dead,'' said Shatner, 68. ``She meant
everything to me. Her laughter, her tears and her joy will remain
with me the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Shatner, the star of ``Star Trek,'' ``T.J. Hooker'' and ``Rescue
911,'' discovered the body of Nerine Shatner, 40, when he returned
to the home about 9:30 p.m. Monday. He pulled her body from the
pool and tried to revive her, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Shatner had filed for divorce Oct. 21, 11 months after the
couple wed, citing irreconcilable differences, according to The
Associated Press. Papers filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court
said the Shatners had separated Oct. 14 but did not indicate
whether Shatner intended to proceed with the divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Police said it was an accidental drowning. There was no evidence
of foul play and detectives said they have no evidence that drugs
or alcohol playing a role in the death.
</P>
<P>
   Shatner married the former model in 1997 and they lived in a
hilltop home in Studio City overlooking the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Nerine Shatner, described by family members as a competent
swimmer, had been home alone and was last seen about 6 p.m. Monday,
Coffey said.
</P>
<P>
   After visiting family in Orange County, the actor returned home
to find his wife at the bottom of the deep end of their pool,
police said. He dove into the water, carried her out of the pool
and called 911.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knew how to swim,'' said Los Angeles police Detective Mike
Coffey of the North Hollywood Division. ``There were no obvious
signs of injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles County Coroner's Office has scheduled an autopsy
today.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly Nerine Kidd, a model for the prestigious Ford modeling
agency, she married the veteran Starfleet Capt. Kirk in November
1997. She was his third wife; he was her first husband.
</P>
<P>
   William Shatner, who also hosted the former CBS-TV series
``Rescue 911,'' began his wedding vows with, ``I pledge allegiance
to you, Nerine, my queen.''
</P>
<P>
   As he placed an emerald-cut diamond on her finger, he said,
``When it is dark and there is trouble, you need but wave that
bauble and there will be light.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors of the Shatners said the couple was always willing to
give a friendly hello and sometimes hosted Neighborhood Watch
meetings at their 4,016-square-foot home, where they lived with
three Doberman pinschers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real tragedy. I feel terrible for her and for him,''
said David Shane, who lives two doors away from the couple.

GUNMAN OPENS FIRE AT JEWISH CENTER

 AND ROBERG MONROE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Without saying a word, a middle-age, balding
white gunman stormed the North Valley Jewish Community Center on
Tuesday and sprayed about 30 shots in the lobby and hallway,
wounding three children and two staff members.
</P>
<P>
   He fled on foot to a waiting van and drove off, eluding a
massive task force of police and FBI agents during a daylong effort
to track him down. The attacker left five wounded and a mystery as
to his motive.
</P>
<P>
   Panicked parents of the nearly 300 children at the day camp
raced to the area where they had emotional reunions with their
children at a nearby temple.
</P>
<P>
   As the gunfire erupted about 10:45 a.m., children scrambled
under desks and teachers locked their doors and tried to hide
youngsters as the attacker unleashed a burst of rounds from a 9 mm
automatic weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard about 30 to 40 bullets,'' said a 36-year-old North
Hollywood woman who glimpsed the gunman when the shooting began.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then he ran outside. I thought he might see me in the
classroom, so I shut the shades and hid,'' she said. ``A little boy
was lying on the ground. He was bleeding. And it looked like we
were losing him.''
</P>
<P>
   The receptionist, 68-year-old Isabelle Shalometh, was among the
first to see the balding gunman as he strode in with an Uzi machine
gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``She saw him coming at her _ and he just started firing,'' said
Shalometh's daughter, Lucille Shalometh Goldin, 40, of Calabasas.
``She knew enough to get down and crawl into the back office.''
</P>
<P>
   Before she could hide, bullets grazed her left arm and back. She
was released after treatment.
</P>
<P>
   A 5-year-old boy standing in the hall was hit in the left leg
and stomach. He is reported in fair condition. A 6-year-old boy
struck in the foot was treated and released to his parents.
</P>
<P>
   Bullets pierced walls and ricocheted, hitting another 6-year-old
boy and a 16-year-old female camp counselor. Both were in stable
condition at hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   And then as suddenly as the gunman appeared, he left the
building and disappeared. Later, a woman reported that a man
carjacked her green Toyota Corolla after abandoning a red van with
Washington state plates and laden with ammunition, a flak jacket
and survivalist books.
</P>
<P>
   Police, working with agents from the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms, began a methodical search of the neighborhood
with dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can run, but you can't hide,'' said Los Angeles police
Cmdr. David Kalish. ``We have a lot of resources. It's just a
matter of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Several minutes after the 911 call came in at 10:49 a.m.,
officers arrived at the school to find a 16-year-old staff member
lying on the ground with wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no idea what was going on,'' said Training Officer Carl
Oschmann. ``They said there were children with various injuries in
different parts of the school.''
</P>
<P>
   In the nursery school room, a boy lay wounded. ``He seemed
rather calm. He had a look of concern. I think he was awestruck by
the sight of us and all our guns,'' Oschmann said.
</P>
<P>
   While police secured the building and searched for the gunman,
paramedics removed the injured.
</P>
<P>
   Frantic parents soon crowded the police security line a short
distance away, trying to find their children. One man was briefly
detained after he broke through the tape, but was later released.
</P>
<P>
   Children were led hand in hand to the nearby Temple Beth Torah,
where they were reunited with their parents. Panic-stricken parents
ran down Rinaldi Street, as close as they could get to the school,
then wept and hugged each other, yelling frantically into cell
phones.
</P>
<P>
   A woman screamed, ``I don't know where he is'' into a cell
phone. One child rested in his father's arms trying to explain the
unexplainable: ``There was a bad guy,'' he concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen panicked preschoolers and teachers fled next door to
the Rinaldi Convalescent Hospital. A 6-year-old boy with shrapnel
in his left foot was among those seeking refuge, said administrator
David Hibarger.
</P>
<P>
   ``His shoe was off and he was crying,'' said Hibarger, who had
nurses tend to the injured boy.
</P>
<P>
   To help calm down the frightened group, Hibarger ordered the
hospital's head cook to prepare grilled cheese sandwiches and
orange juice. ``They're sitting on the floor and one of the
counselors is playing the piano.''
</P>

CITY COUNCIL LINES UP AGAINST TAXES FOR TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Just in case the National Football League didn't
get the message, the Los Angeles City Council drove home the point
that there is opposition to the use of tax money to win an
expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   Although the council put off a final vote until next week, a
majority of members made it clear that they will not support the
use of any public money to get a professional football team to
return to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt in my mind that an NFL team belongs back in
Los Angeles and at the Coliseum,'' Councilwoman Laura Chick said.
</P>
<P>
   `We have everything it takes to bring a team back. We have the
fans, the marketplace, the facilities and the private sector
leadership willing to put together a financial package. What we
don't have and shouldn't have is use of our precious and short
taxpayer dollars for this project.''
</P>
<P>
   Chick introduced a resolution that would require a public vote
approving use of tax dollars for any professional sports team.
</P>
<P>
   NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said he would not comment on the
council's debate.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mike Hernandez said the NFL is misjudging the city
and its market.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you asked my constituents, they would rather see the World
Cup than the Super Bowl,'' Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   The city's bid for an NFL team faces a Sept. 15 deadline to get
a final package together. The NFL has broadened its hunt for a Los
Angeles area site by inviting proposals from sites other than the
Coliseum.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the latest in a string of seemingly
inexplicable shootings, a balding, white, middle-aged man walked
into a Jewish community center in the middle-class neighborhood of
Granada Hills on Tuesday morning and shot five people, including
three young boys at a day camp, then fled.
</P>
<P>
   A 3{-year-old boy who said he was just a few feet from the
shooting _ his mother would only give his name as Eric _ said the
man had said nothing before fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad monster ran away,'' said the boy, who clung to his
mother and asked her if any of the wounded children had done
anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the victims were said to be in good condition and
were expected to be released soon from local hospitals, but a
5-year-old boy, who had been shot in the abdomen, was said to be in
critical condition after undergoing surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The police searched a square-mile area around the North Valley
Jewish Community Center for the gunman, who fired as many as 30
shots with an automatic or semiautomatic 9-millimeter handgun,
officials said. The gunman was described as about 40.
</P>
<P>
   As officers searched the neighborhood, they asked residents to
remain indoors while the search continued.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the afternoon, Comdr. David Kalish of the Los Angeles
Police Department said officers had searched a red van, with
Washington state license plates, about two miles away, near the Van
Nuys Airport and had found ``an incredible amount of ammunition,''
a bulletproof vest and ``substantial other evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Kalish also said that at about noon there had been a carjacking
in which a white male who generally matched the description of the
suspect in the shooting had stolen a dark green 1999 Toyota
Corolla.
</P>
<P>
   The police later said that the van's driver was the same man who
had stolen the car at gunpoint, and that they had been led to the
van while investigating the theft.
</P>
<P>
   In the early evening, the Toyota was found by officers several
miles away in the Chatsworth neighborhood at a hotel that the
police then surrounded. The police then cleared guests from large
areas of the hotel, though it was not clear if the person they
sought was inside.
</P>
<P>
   In the early evening, FBI agents and local law-enforcement
officers searched a house in Olympia, Wash., after tracing the
van's registration.
</P>
<P>
   The person connected with the Olympia address was arrested on a
charge of assault with a knife last November, KING-TV in Seattle,
reported on Tuesday night. The same person was also a suspect in
the theft of ammunition from Fort Lewis, the station reported.
</P>
<P>
   Within 30 minutes of the shooting, at about 10:45 a.m.,
helicopter crews from local television stations broadcast images of
police officers leading children out of the center, hand in hand in
strings of five, six and seven. Firefighters and paramedics at the
scene said the children had been orderly, though upset.
</P>
<P>
   But as the area was being searched, the police lines at the
community center quickly became jammed with parents waiting
anxiously to hear about their children, neighbors stunned by the
violence so near their homes and scores of reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents were reunited with their children in the street,
and they frequently stayed in the area, hugging their children,
chatting with friends and other parents, so mystified by the
violence that they seemed unconcerned that the shooter could still
be in the neighborhood. The Fire Department brought a cooler of
drinks for the parents around mid-day as they waited for word of
their children.
</P>
<P>
   Lucille Shalometh Goldin was quoted by the City News Service as
saying that her mother, Isabelle Shalometh, a receptionist at the
center, had been slightly wounded in the arm and back.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said a young man, a ruffian, she saw him coming at her and
I guess he just started open firing,'' Ms. Goldin said, ``and she
knew enough to quickly duck down and she did.''
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Steve Ruda of the Fire Department said that in addition to
Ms. Shalometh, 68, a 16-year-girl was shot in the right thigh and
shin, a 6-year-old boy was wounded in the left foot and another
6-year-old boy was shot in the left leg and left hip. The most
serious injuries were to the 5-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the gunman was about 5 foot 8 to 5 foot 10,
weighed about 170 pounds and was dressed in green clothing.
</P>
<P>
   They said he had apparently fled west on Rinaldi Street, at
least initially on foot, and then disappeared. A SWAT team
conducted house to house searches with dogs. In addition, the FBI
and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms sent teams to the
residential area, in the San Fernando Valley about 30 miles
northwest of downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The images of armed officers searching alleys, sheds and homes,
of anxious parents and fleeing children were broadcast for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Because the incident followed what has been a string of
shootings in recent months, and comes in the middle of an intense
debate over the availability of firearms, it was followed closely
by officials across the state and in Washington. President Clinton
said, ``Once again our nation has been shaken and our hearts torn''
by what he called ``another senseless act of gun violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis of California said, ``Once again, we have been
shocked, saddened and outraged by an act of vicious gun violence
aimed against defenseless children and innocent adults.'' He
offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to an arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were treated at the site and then taken to local
hospitals, some by ambulance and some by helicopter. The police
focused on getting the children organized and calm, and reuniting
them with their parents, who began to show up about noon.
</P>
<P>
   The North Valley Jewish Community Center, like similar Jewish
centers throughout the country, is not a place of worship, but an
educational and recreation site serving people of all ages.

HOME-CARE WORKERS OK FIRST CONTRACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Los Angeles County home-care workers have
overwhelmingly approved their first contract, six months after
agreeing to unionize in the largest such election in the nation's
history.
</P>
<P>
   The 26,095-260 vote means an 8.5 percent pay raise to $6.25 an
hour for the 74,000 workers who feed, bathe and assist elderly and
disabled who qualify for Social Security benefits. The raise is
retroactive to July 1.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, negotiated between Local 434B of the Service
Employees International Union and a county-appointed
consumer-controlled board, also provides for a job registry, an
ombudsman procedure and plans for low-income transportation
programs to ease costs for consumers. A study committee is
developing plans for health-care coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new contract is not everything we wanted but it's a step
in the right direction,'' said union representative Gerry Vaughn.
Workers should see increased paychecks next month, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Home-care workers, who previously received no benefits, are paid
with federal, state and county funds. The state Legislature and
Gov. Gray Davis have approved allocation of $38 million to absorb
the additional costs this year; legislation has been introduced to
make those funds a permanent part of the state's annual budget.
</P>
<P>
   February's vote to unionize, which won by an 8-to-1 margin,
capped a decade-long organizing drive that highlighted the success
of labor's recent strategy to target low-wage minority and
immigrant workers.

HOWARD &AMP; PHIL'S STORES REOPENED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON TAKENOUCHI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARITA _ The company that gobbled up the remaining assets
of defunct Howard &AMP; Phil's Western Wear has reopened two of the
chain's stores, including one in the Valencia Town Center, and
plans to open several more stores in California.
</P>
<P>
   Utah-based Alta Montana Corp. Inc. purchased an estimated $3.75
million in Howard and Phil's inventory for about $425,000 last
month. The company has since opened retail stores in Valencia and
Orem, Utah, and officials are negotiating in California to move
into other malls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be negotiating with the malls where Howard &AMP; Phil's used
to be,'' said Marc Didier, president and chief executive officer of
Alta Montana. ``We should have another one open in the next two
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The new stores have a wider selection than the failed Howard &AMP;
Phil's, he said, including Mexican boots imported and marketed by
Alta Montana. Didier says Alta Montana has more than twice the
inventory Howard &AMP; Phil's had.
</P>
<P>
   But the revival of shuttered stores will not affect a creditor's
lawsuit against the four McKeon brothers _ Timothy, Monte, Joseph
and John _ who ran Howard &AMP; Phil's until its closure in May.
</P>
<P>
   The creditor, West Los Angeles-based Coast Business Credit,
filed the lawsuit June 23 in Los Angeles Superior Court. It alleges
that the brothers overstated the value of their inventory and used
those claims to borrow more money from Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Coast officials said they did not sue a fifth McKeon brother,
Rep. Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon, R-Santa Clarita, because the
congressman was not involved in management of the defunct Canyon
Country-based company. He owned 20 percent of Howard &AMP; Phil's,
which was founded by the five brothers' parents.
</P>
<P>
   The reopened stores will have some of the same merchandise,
fixtures, employees and management as the old Howard &AMP; Phil's
outlets. The new stores even bear a logo with the skull of a
longhorn, similar to the Howard &AMP; Phil's logo.
</P>
<P>
   And Valencia store manager Don Williams, former general
merchandise manager for Howard &AMP; Phil's and brother-in-law of Monte
McKeon, said the new stores have accepted several gift certificates
from the failed retailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to handle ... many of the outstanding problems
that happened before, when it was Howard &AMP; Phil's,'' Williams said.
``But we have to be sensitive to the new company, too.''
</P>
<P>
   While some former Howard &AMP; Phil's workers will be offered jobs
at Alta Montana stores, Williams said there is no formal connection
with the Howard &AMP; Phil's chain.
</P>
<P>
   Former Howard &AMP; Phil's employees who have filed wage claims
against the defunct company will have to seek relief elsewhere, he
said.

   KOSOVO-OUTLOOK (Pristina, Yugoslavia) _ The U.N. mission in
Kosovo is finally moving to establish its authority here as the

Kosovo Liberation Army. Senior U.N. officials admit that they are
now in a period of testing with the KLA, but they are also eager
not to drive the army into opposition. To that end, says Bernard
Kouchner, the chief U.N. administrator in Kosovo, he wants to pull
the KLA and and others into the exercise of power and will offer to
provide them a share of executive responsibility as quickly as
possible. By Steven Erlanger.

crab _ callinectes sapidus to marine biologists, which means
``savory beautiful swimmer'' in Latin. But not the run-of-the-mill
fellows. Walton fishes for ``busters'' or ``peelers,'' which are
crabs that have already begun to shed their shells, or are about
to, prior to growing new ones. If you catch them at the right
moment, and pull them from the water, the process of growth stops
and you have a soft-shell crab, one of summer's most prized treats

WILLIAMS BEATS LIKHOVTSEVA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN BEACH _ Serena Williams went through a
mini-metamorphosis. She entered the stadium court Tuesday night
shaky, spraying errors as frequently as her braids shook. She left
the court confident, a winner.
</P>
<P>
   In her first singles match in two months, Williams beat Russian
Elena Likhovtseva, 4-6, 6-3, 6-1, in the Acura Classic at Manhattan
Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first set, I definitely got more confident as the
match went on,'' Williams said. ``... I think I was playing awesome
in practice. You should've of seen me. I was ready to go on the
men's tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyperbole aside, Williams did look strong in her final two sets.
She was especially dominant in the third set as she won 28 of the
set's 42 points.
</P>
<P>
   The first set, however, was quite the contrast. Tied 4-4,
Williams served with a 40-0 lead. She had five consecutive forced
errors to give the game to Likhovtseva. Williams agreed that she
was tentative in that set. She also agreed that she didn't get her
groove back until she led, 2-1, in the second set.
</P>
<P>
   Williams missed Wimbledon because, she said, she had a bad case
of the flu, which caused her to lose 10 pounds. In essence, then,
she was away from playing singles for two months because of the
flu.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people speculate, `Like where is she really?'''
Williams said. ``That's OK to me, to see that in the press.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of that mini-mystery, Williams is ranked 11th on the
WTA tour, even though this is only her ninth tournament. She glibly
mentioned this Tuesday and after a brief treatise on the rankings,
said, ``I'm saying if I'd play 20 (tournaments), I'd take the top
spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 17, is the sister of fourth-ranked Venus Williams and
will be missing more tournaments later this year. She plans to
enter college in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. at a fashion institute.
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams, by the way, did not enter the Acura Classic's
singles, but entered the doubles only to withdraw with her sister
Tuesday because of fatigue. That fatigue, however, didn't prevent
her from attending her sister's match.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Williams, the sisters' father, coached the two. He took
photos of Serena during her match. That may not noteworthy, except
that Serena was so relaxed after her return match that she stir the
conversation to many things not tennis from the photos to her dog
to surfing in Florida on what she called the low-tide ``Atlantic
Lake.''
</P>
<P>
   What could have made her father's pictures noteworthy was that
the renegade photographer used a flash, even though that's a no-no
at night tennis matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used a flash?'' Serena asked. ``I didn't see a flash at
all. I was really focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Serena continued to say that her father takes the photos, so she
can get ``a daily dose of me.'' She added that the photos are her
father's idea, even though it seemed like she doesn't mind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know in my house, there's going to be a lot of mirrors,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the conversation moved back to tennis and
Likhovtseva. Williams complimented her opponent, saying she
improved and could no longer be overpowered. Likhovtseva is a
finesse player, ranked 21st in the world. Her style contrasted the
grunt-oriented power of Williams.
</P>
<P>
   But without Williams making unforced errors, Likhovtseva's hopes
of winning Tuesday gradually were erased.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels great,'' Williams said to summarize her return. ``You
forget how it feels out here.''
</P>
<P>
   And others forget about the photos, dog and surfing.

JUMP SHOT ISN'T ONLY THING ABOUT MAXWELL THAT'S WAY OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After Dennis Rodman and Latrell Sprewell, there is no more
notorious player in the NBA than Vernon Maxwell.
</P>
<P>
   The man has a rap sheet longer than his equally notorious jump
shot, which, like his behavior, can explode from nowhere for no
reason.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, he has an NBA championship ring. Rodman has five,
and Sprewell in June was large in helping the eighth-seeded New
York Knicks reach the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the Sonics have come to the realization that they
aren't picking out dates for the prom.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is looking the other way,'' Sonics president Wally
Walker said of the decision to sign the volatile Maxwell and change
the team rhythm from Mel Torme to Puff Daddy. ``There's been full
disclosure, and everything Max has done is a public record. But
what we're basing our decision on is his recent past and the trend
from there. He's reached a level of maturity that makes for better
decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, the light goes on at different times for different
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the light went on for Maxwell last season, when he
was a stellar sixth man for a Sacramento team that was the NBA's
most entertaining outfit and nearly upset venerable Utah in the
playoffs' opening round.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the 6-foot-4 guard was offensive lightning and
defensive thunder, as well as a civil citizen. Kings players and
management were uniformly aggrieved last week at having to renounce
his rights in order to sign a younger free agent starting guard,
Nick Anderson, from Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   But to have His Madness part of the Sonics world, well, it's
like rolling a Harley chopper into Grandma's holiday living room.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, that's Christmas to Gary Payton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to stop saying we're going to get these `quality' guys
who won't give us image problems,'' the Sonics star told the P-I
last month. ``We have to go after a guy like Vernon Maxwell _ you
know, hard-nosed guys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to just say (deleted) it and get some tough players in
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, to put it another way, Jim McIlvaine was one of the nicest
guys in sports.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, though I'm not prepared to recommend ushering
women and children off the street when Maxwell comes to town, there
are reasons that Seattle will be his seventh NBA team in six
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   As you can see from the following compilation, principally from
the archives of the Houston Chronicle, if it doesn't work out for
Maxwell here, he can always get work as a lead actor for the video
of Warren Zevon's song, ``Lawyers, Guns and Money.''
</P>
<P>
   -- He filed last August for bankruptcy in an Atlanta federal
court one day before a civil trial was to begin in Houston, where a
woman was suing him for knowingly giving her genital herpes in
1995. The bankruptcy filing prevented the civil case from going to
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The woman already had won a default judgment of $592,000 against
Maxwell in February 1996, but the ruling was overturned when
Maxwell claimed he was improperly served with court papers. Maxwell
later explained in a court hearing that he has been targeted by so
many legal actions that it was hard to keep track of suits and
subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   -- In August 1997, he was sued by a finance company for a loan
on a Ferrari he defaulted on. The car was repossessed.
</P>
<P>
   -- In 1997-98, with his NBA future on the precipice, he played
42 games for Orlando and Charlotte. The Magic let him go after two
10-day contracts partly because he skipped a practice. The Hornets
cut him on the eve of the playoffs because he was in a Houston
jail, serving a 90-day sentence for misdemeanor possession of
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The dope was found in his car after a 1995 arrest for running a
red light in Houston. Maxwell appealed the conviction all the way
to the U.S. Supreme Court, which refused to hear the case.
</P>
<P>
   -- In May 1997, Maxwell was attacked and beaten by two men in
downtown Houston at 1 a.m., in a street fight involving gunfire. A
vehicle Maxwell had been seen in contained his ID, marijuana and
possibly counterfeit $20 bills. Under a false name, Maxwell showed
up at a hospital emergency room for treatment. No charges were
filed.
</P>
<P>
   -- In March 1997, the San Antonio Spurs suspended him for a game
for gestures and body language that taunted fans at Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   -- In February 1997, he missed a two-game road trip to Florida
because of what the Spurs said was anemia. But the Orlando Sentinel
reported that he wanted to avoid Orlando and Miami because police
were prepared to arrest him for failure to pay child support in
Alachua County.
</P>
<P>
   -- In August 1995, the month he was busted, he was named as the
father of a 20-year-old woman's baby in a paternity suit. He was
later ordered to pay child support. Also, he had his $600,000 home
in a Houston suburb foreclosed by the mortgage holder. When he was
arrested on the drug charge, he told the arresting officers that he
was living in his sports coupe.
</P>
<P>
   -- In July 1995, his wife, Resharita, filed for divorce,
alleging he had committed adultery for five years and treated her
cruelly. Court documents later disclosed that he fathered three
children outside of his marriage and three with Resharita. The
couple has since reconciled.
</P>
<P>
   -- In May 1995, he left the defending champion Houston Rockets
after one playoff game, ostensibly because of personal problems.
The Rockets subsequently suspended him. A couple of weeks later, he
told the Chronicle, ``I never had any personal problems. That was
just something I made up. The deal was, I wasn't playing, that was
it. I couldn't take it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish them well. As long as they keep going, I'm still
getting paid. Here I am on vacation, drinking brews and playing
golf and getting paid.''
</P>
<P>
   -- His most egregious public embarrassment came in February
1995, when he rushed into the stands in Portland and punched a fan,
for which he was suspended 10 games and fined $20,000. No evidence
was found to back Maxwell's claim that the 35-year-old man used
racial slurs and taunted his family. Maxwell subsequently settled
out of court with the fan.
</P>
<P>
   -- In March 1994, he was charged with slugging another patron
with a bottle in a San Antonio bar.
</P>
<P>
   -- The same month, he was fined $1,500 for carrying a concealed
gun in his Porsche. The charges came after he waved a pistol at
another driver who honked at him in a cafeteria parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   -- In July 1993, he was given probation after pleading no
contest to fighting with two Houston cops trying to remove him from
a night club.
</P>
<P>
   -- In July 1992, he was arrested for fighting a Houston
nightclub bouncer.
</P>
<P>
   -- For a local angle, in November 1992, he was ejected and fined
$7,000 for a flagrant foul against the Sonics' Nate McMillan during
the teams' season opener in Yokohama, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the ``quality guy'' characteristic that was
bothering Payton about the Sonics makeup.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more remarkable things about Maxwell is that he feels
no compulsion to apologize for his conduct, just as he owns up,
without pretense, to what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did everything that was said and written,'' Maxwell said
Monday in a conference call with local reporters. ``I just want you
to judge me when you meet me. Get to know me and then judge me now,
not for my past.''
</P>
<P>
   His past includes good stuff, too, principally the '94
championship with the Rockets during Michael Jordan's first
retirement. Maxwell scored 21 points in their Game 7 victory over
the New York Knicks, including a late fadeaway trey in the corner
that was the clincher.
</P>
<P>
   His outside shooting and relentless defense were vital parts of
the Rockets' unexpected title run. But a year later, when the
Rockets defended their championship, he was gone, done in by his
own head.
</P>
<P>
   After the Portland fan episode and suspension, the Rockets
couldn't rely on Maxwell, so they traded Otis Thorpe to Portland
for Clyde Drexler. When Maxwell returned, he was a reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to tell Vernon that Clyde is a Dream Teamer. He's one
of the all-time greats,'' said then-teammate Mario Elie. ``You just
have to adjust. But Vernon isn't an adjuster. Truth is, it made us
come together more as a team when he left. I guess in the end,
everybody got what they wanted. We got our championship, and he got
to come here to be the king.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he comes to the Sonics with no pretension toward the throne
and no further taste for the dungeon. At 34 next month, Maxwell has
a three-year deal in a place that is desperate for his basketball
passion and energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've found that wherever he's been, he's a popular
teammate,'' Walker said. ``He's a warrior people love having on
their side and hate seeing on the other team. There's a real
positive energy about him. He's a guy players like to share a
foxhole with.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of us, however, would be well advised to stay out of
bars, beds, cars and courts with him.
</P>
<P>
   With Maxwell's signing, the Sonics could not be further out on
the edge _ don't forget he's also their third consecutive free
agent signing of a Sacramento castoff, having gone 0-for-2 with
Olden Polynice and Billy Owens.
</P>
<P>
   But the edge, it is said, is where most of the good living is
done.
</P>
<P>
   Also done there is lots of dying.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATLANTA _ What the Astros seem to need right about now is, well, a
sign.
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking about the kind of sign where third-base coach
Mike Cubbage strokes the bill of his cap, claps and goes into a
series of hand signals that might tell a baserunner what to do. Or,
in the case of the infamous eighth inning of the Monday night
opener in this Astros-Braves series, might not tell them what to
do.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking about the kind of sign that confirms suspicions
and reinforces predictions about this Astros team.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking about the kind of sign that tells the Astros just
how much of a threat they will be in the postseason no matter the
opponent. We're talking about some sort of indication of just how
much things have changed for the Astros since 1997. Or 1998, for
that matter.
</P>
<P>
   The search continued Tuesday night at Turner Field. And in the
aftermath of Braves 6, Astros 4, a scuba unit might soon be called
in to aid in the search.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros still are in first place and still don't look
worried. Nor, probably, should they be, considering that with every
passing day they get one step closer to having Moises Alou and Ken
Caminiti in the arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   But yet again, for all the good things the Astros managed
Tuesday night against the Braves _ solid defensive plays early, a
comeback from a three-run deficit, starter Shane Reynolds righting
the ship through the middle innings _ there were more bad things.
</P>
<P>
   After turning a 3-0 first-inning deficit into a 4-3 lead, there
was Ricky Gutierrez letting a grounder slip between his legs to
open the seventh inning. One batter later, there was third baseman
Russ Johnson committing an error on a bunt attempt. Bret Boone
followed with a two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   Ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't afford to make that many mistakes, especially
leading off an inning,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said. ``We
have to turn the page. We have to move on and win (today).''
</P>
<P>
   Yet again, it wasn't so much what happened to the Astros as how
it happened.
</P>
<P>
   There were no missed signs this time around, just the missed
plays. There was no spectacular play turned in by Braves center
fielder Andruw Jones, but there was a darned good one that probably
saved a couple of runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely thought I had a double,'' said Astros outfielder
Derek Bell, whose hot drive to the gap turned into a mere sacrifice
fly thanks to Jones' speedy recovery. ``I thought it was going to
hit the gap. Man, that guy is just good.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second consecutive day for the Astros to fall just
short. All season, this is the team that has made something out of
being gritty and clutch. But all the Astros could do Tuesday was
again watch the Braves pull out the gritty, clutch win.
</P>
<P>
   ``When two good teams like this play each other, somebody's got
to lose,'' Astros slugger Jeff Bagwell said. ``It's been us the
last two days.''
</P>
<P>
   It has made for the most tormenting of trends for a team many
figure to finally break through in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Against the National League's top contenders _ the Mets, Reds,
Diamondbacks and Braves _ the Astros have dropped to 9-17 for the
season. Over the past two months, that record is 2-13 against those
contenders.
</P>
<P>
   A sign. Some kind of sign is what the Astros might need right
about now.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds have pulled within a game in the division, and no
matter that regular-season records are tossed out once the playoffs
begin, that 2-13 record hangs ominously overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker remains unconcerned, saying: ``I don't think about what
this means down the road. I'm not too worried about all that.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Astros indeed continue to carry a kind of swagger in
spite of the ones that got away against the team of the '90s over
the past two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think, `Oh, that's Atlanta, man, we've got to do this
or that,''' center fielder Carl Everett said. ``I don't give them
any special credit. I never have, and I never will.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Astros needn't worry about what it all means against
the league's good teams. Maybe there remains a championship drive
in this team's future no matter what has happened in the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one game left today against the Braves, then six
against the Mets over the next three weeks and a two-game
late-September set against the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Now's a good time to start looking for signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to win no matter what,'' Bagwell said. ``Every
game counts right now. It doesn't matter who we play.''

INDIANS BEAT ANGELS IN 10
</HEADLINE>

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Chuck Finley and Mark Langston are old friends, and
when it comes to baseball, they're just old, period.
</P>
<P>
   But Finley, who will be 37 in November, and Langston, 39 later
this month, pitched like two young flamethrowers as the Angels
played the Cleveland Indians Tuesday night before 25,777 at Edison
Field.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Finley nor Langston was involved in the decision. Manny
Ramirez hit a sacrifice fly in the 10th inning to give the Indians
a 2-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels put runners at first and third with two out in the
bottom of the 10th, but Indians reliever Mike Jackson struck out
Trent Durrington to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, in his 14th season with the Angels, gave up one run and
five hits in 72/3 innings, striking out seven and walking four (one
intentional). Langston, who pitched for the Angels from 1990-97,
went six innings, allowing one run and three hits while striking
out four.
</P>
<P>
   Finley allowed only one hit through four innings, then wiggled
out of a jam in the fifth after allowing back-to-back singles to
open the inning. But the real trouble started as he took a shutout
into the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Roberts began the inning with a single, and Omar Vizquel
followed with a perfectly placed bunt up the first-base line for a
single. Roberto Alomar sacrificed the runners to second and third,
and Ramirez was intentionally walked, loading the bases and setting
up the play of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thome hit a comebacker to Finley, setting up what should
have been a 1-2-3 double play. But Finley's throw to catcher Ben
Molina was wild, going to the backstop. Roberts scored from third,
but Vizquel was tagged out by Finley at the plate trying to score
from second.
</P>
<P>
   The inning still wasn't over, but after walking Richie Sexson,
Finley struck out David Justice to keep the game tied at 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels took the lead off their ex-teammate Langston in the
second inning when Darin Erstad connected for his 10th home run of
the season. Langston, however, didn't allow the Angels to score
again by the time he was finished. And he retired the side in order
in his final inning of work.
</P>
<P>
   Finley retired the first two batters in the eighth inning, but
after walking Manny Ramirez and Thome, Finley was replaced by Troy
Percival, who got Sexson on a popout to end the frame.
</P>
<P>
   Langston and Finley were teammates for eight seasons with the
Angels, from 1990-97. In each of those seasons, one or both of them
led the pitching staff in victories. They combined for 200
victories in those eight seasons, including 37 (Langston 19, Finley
18) in 1991.

GUNMAN OPENS FIRE AT JEWISH CENTER

 PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 AND ROBERG MONROE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Without saying a word, a middle-age, balding
white gunman stormed the North Valley Jewish Community Center on
Tuesday and sprayed about 70 shots in the lobby and hallway,
wounding three children and two staff members.
</P>
<P>
   He fled on foot to a waiting van and drove off, eluding a
massive task force of police and FBI agents during a daylong effort
to track him down. The attacker left five wounded and a mystery as
to his motive.
</P>
<P>
   Panicked parents of the nearly 300 children at the day camp
raced to the area where they had emotional reunions with their
children at a nearby temple.
</P>
<P>
   As the gunfire erupted about 10:45 a.m., children scrambled
under desks and teachers locked their doors and tried to hide
youngsters as the attacker unleashed a burst of rounds from a 9 mm
automatic weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard about 30 to 40 bullets,'' said a 36-year-old North
Hollywood woman who glimpsed the gunman when the shooting began.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then he ran outside. I thought he might see me in the
classroom, so I shut the shades and hid,'' she said. ``A little boy
was lying on the ground. He was bleeding. And it looked like we
were losing him.''
</P>
<P>
   The receptionist, 68-year-old Isabelle Shalometh, was among the
first to see the balding gunman as he strode in with an Uzi machine
gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``She saw him coming at her _ and he just started firing,'' said
Shalometh's daughter, Lucille Shalometh Goldin, 40, of Calabasas.
``She knew enough to get down and crawl into the back office.''
</P>
<P>
   Before she could hide, bullets grazed her left arm and back. She
was released after treatment.
</P>
<P>
   A 5-year-old boy standing in the hall was hit in the left leg
and stomach. He is reported in fair condition. A 6-year-old boy
struck in the foot was treated and released to his parents.
</P>
<P>
   Bullets pierced walls and ricocheted, hitting another 6-year-old
boy and a 16-year-old female camp counselor. Both were in stable
condition at hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   And then as suddenly as the gunman appeared, he left the
building and disappeared. Later, a woman reported that a man
carjacked her green Toyota Corolla after abandoning a red van with
Washington state plates and laden with ammunition, a flak jacket
and survivalist books.
</P>
<P>
   Police, working with agents from the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms, began a methodical search of the neighborhood
with dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can run, but you can't hide,'' said Los Angeles police
Cmdr. David Kalish. ``We have a lot of resources. It's just a
matter of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Several minutes after the 911 call came in at 10:49 a.m.,
officers arrived at the school to find a 16-year-old staff member
lying on the ground with wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no idea what was going on,'' said Training Officer Carl
Oschmann. ``They said there were children with various injuries in
different parts of the school.''
</P>
<P>
   In the nursery school room, a boy lay wounded. ``He seemed
rather calm. He had a look of concern. I think he was awestruck by
the sight of us and all our guns,'' Oschmann said.
</P>
<P>
   While police secured the building and searched for the gunman,
paramedics removed the injured.
</P>
<P>
   Frantic parents soon crowded the police security line a short
distance away, trying to find their children. One man was briefly
detained after he broke through the tape, but was later released.
</P>
<P>
   Children were led hand in hand to the nearby Temple Beth Torah,
where they were reunited with their parents. Panic-stricken parents
ran down Rinaldi Street, as close as they could get to the school,
then wept and hugged each other, yelling frantically into cell
phones.
</P>
<P>
   A woman screamed, ``I don't know where he is'' into a cell
phone. One child rested in his father's arms trying to explain the
unexplainable: ``There was a bad guy,'' he concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen panicked preschoolers and teachers fled next door to
the Rinaldi Convalescent Hospital. A 6-year-old boy with shrapnel
in his left foot was among those seeking refuge, said administrator
David Hibarger.
</P>
<P>
   ``His shoe was off and he was crying,'' said Hibarger, who had
nurses tend to the injured boy.
</P>
<P>
   To help calm down the frightened group, Hibarger ordered the
hospital's head cook to prepare grilled cheese sandwiches and
orange juice. ``They're sitting on the floor and one of the
counselors is playing the piano.''
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the latest in a string of seemingly
inexplicable shootings, a balding, white, middle-aged man walked
into a Jewish community center in the middle-class neighborhood of
Granada Hills on Tuesday morning and shot five people, including
three young boys at a day camp, then fled.
</P>
<P>
   After a daylong search, Comdr. David Kalish of the Los Angeles
Police Department identified the suspect in the case as Buford O.
Furrow Jr., 37, a Washington state resident. He said, however, that
the police did not know Furrow's whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   When officers arrived at the center on Tuesday afternoon, smoke
from the gunfire lingered in the air and spent shells littered the
floor, Kalish said.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the shooting later, a 3{-year-old boy _ whose mother
would only give his name as Eric _ said he was just a few feet from
the shooting and that the man had said nothing before fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad monster ran away,'' said the boy, who clung to his
mother and asked her if any of the wounded children had done
anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the victims were said to be in good condition and
were expected to be released soon from local hospitals, but a
5-year-old boy, who had been shot in the abdomen, was said to be in
critical condition after undergoing surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The police searched a square-mile area around the North Valley
Jewish Community Center for the gunman, who fired as many as 30
shots with an automatic or semiautomatic 9-millimeter handgun,
officials said. The gunman was described as about 40.
</P>
<P>
   As officers searched the neighborhood, they asked residents to
remain indoors while the search continued.
</P>
<P>
   Kalish said on Tuesday night that the link to Furrow was a red
van, with Washington state license plates, that was found about two
miles away from the center, near the Van Nuys Airport. Inside,
officers found ``an incredible amount of ammunition,'' a
bulletproof vest and ``substantial other evidence,'' Kalish said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that at about noon Furrow forced a woman out of a dark
green 1999 Toyota Corolla at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   In the early evening, the Toyota was found by officers several
miles away in the Chatsworth neighborhood at a hotel that the
police then surrounded. The police cleared guests from large areas
of the hotel, but after further inspection they could not find
Furrow.
</P>
<P>
   After Furrow was identified from the van, FBI agents and local
law enforcement officers searched a house in Olympia, Wash., in the
early evening.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow was arrested on a charge of assault with a knife last
November, KING-TV in Seattle, reported on Tuesday night. He was
also a suspect in the theft of ammunition from Fort Lewis, the
station reported.
</P>
<P>
   Within 30 minutes of the shooting, at about 10:45 a.m.,
helicopter crews from local television stations broadcast images of
police officers leading children out of the center, hand in hand in
strings of five, six and seven. Firefighters and paramedics at the
scene said the children had been orderly, though upset.
</P>
<P>
   But as the area was being searched, the police lines at the
community center quickly became jammed with parents waiting
anxiously to hear about their children, neighbors stunned by the
violence so near their homes and scores of reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents were reunited with their children in the street,
and they frequently stayed in the area, hugging their children,
chatting with friends and other parents, so mystified by the
violence that they seemed unconcerned that the shooter could still
be in the neighborhood. The Fire Department brought a cooler of
drinks for the parents around mid-day as they waited for word of
their children.
</P>
<P>
   Lucille Shalometh Goldin was quoted by the City News Service as
saying that her mother, Isabelle Shalometh, a receptionist at the
center, had been slightly wounded in the arm and back.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said a young man, a ruffian, she saw him coming at her and
I guess he just started open firing,'' Ms. Goldin said, ``and she
knew enough to quickly duck down and she did.''
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Steve Ruda of the Fire Department said that in addition to
Ms. Shalometh, 68, a 16-year-girl was shot in the right thigh and
shin, a 6-year-old boy was wounded in the left foot and another
6-year-old boy was shot in the left leg and left hip. The most
serious injuries were to the 5-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the gunman was about 5 foot 8 to 5 foot 10,
weighed about 170 pounds and was dressed in green clothing.
</P>
<P>
   They said he had apparently fled west on Rinaldi Street, at
least initially on foot, and then disappeared. A SWAT team
conducted house to house searches with dogs. In addition, the FBI
and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms sent teams to the
residential area, in the San Fernando Valley about 30 miles
northwest of downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The images of armed officers searching alleys, sheds and homes,
of anxious parents and fleeing children were broadcast for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Because the incident followed what has been a string of
shootings in recent months, and comes in the middle of an intense
debate over the availability of firearms, it was followed closely
by officials across the state and in Washington. President Clinton
said, ``Once again our nation has been shaken and our hearts torn''
by what he called ``another senseless act of gun violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis of California said, ``Once again, we have been
shocked, saddened and outraged by an act of vicious gun violence
aimed against defenseless children and innocent adults.'' He
offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to an arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were treated at the site and then taken to local
hospitals, some by ambulance and some by helicopter. The police
focused on getting the children organized and calm, and reuniting
them with their parents, who began to show up about noon.
</P>
<P>
   The North Valley Jewish Community Center, like similar Jewish
centers throughout the country, is not a place of worship, but an
educational and recreation site serving people of all ages.

ANGELS LOSE PITCHERS' DUEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Chuck Finley and Mark Langston are old friends, and
when it comes to baseball, they're just old, period.
</P>
<P>
   But Finley, who will be 37 in November, and ex-Angel Langston,
39 later this month, pitched like two young flamethrowers as the
Angels played the Cleveland Indians on Tuesday night before 25,777
at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Finley nor Langston were involved in the decision and
both were icing their arms by the time Manny Ramirez drove in Omar
Vizquel with a sacrifice fly in the 10th inning to give the Indians
a 2-1 victory. It was Ramirez's major league-leading 115th RBI of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Petkovsek (9-4) gave up the 10th-inning run and got the
loss. Ricky Rincon (1-2) earned the victory and Mike Jackson
pitched the 10th for his 25th save.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels threatened in the 10th, when with two out Orlando
Palmeiro walked and went to third on Jeff Huson's single to center.
But Trent Durrington, called up from Double-A Erie less than a week
ago, struck out to end it.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, in his 14th season with the Angels, gave up one run and
five hits in 72/3 innings, striking out seven and walking four (one
intentional). Langston, who pitched for the Angels from 1990-97,
went six innings, allowing one run and three hits while striking
out four and walking three.
</P>
<P>
   Finley very easily could have been the Indians' starting pitcher
on Tuesday, but a possible trading-deadline deal never
materialized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one of the big lobbiers for Chuck,'' Langston said.
``I've know him longer than anyone else on that team.
Unfortunately, it didn't work out. He would have been a great
addition to this club.... He completely dominated this team
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley, however, made one big mistake Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Finley took a shutout into the sixth, but Dave Roberts began the
inning with a single and Vizquel followed with a perfectly placed
bunt up the first-base line for a single. Roberto Alomar sacrificed
the runners to second and third, and Ramirez was intentionally
walked, loading the bases and setting up the play of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thome hit a comebacker to Finley, setting up what should
have been a 1-2-3 double play. But Finley's throw to catcher Ben
Molina was wild, going to the backstop. Roberts scored from third,
but Vizquel was tagged out by Finley at the plate trying to score
from second.
</P>
<P>
   The inning still wasn't over, but after walking Richie Sexson,
Finley struck out David Justice to keep the game tied at 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get my feet set,'' Finley said of the error. ``It got
on me and I kind of got a little excited.''
</P>
<P>
   For Langston, facing the Angels and Finley was exciting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very emotional to come back here,'' Langston said. ``It's
just my fourth start in a year, so I'm excited just to start a
game. And then to have it in Anaheim, where I played all those
years, and against Chuck... it made it very special.''
</P>

MARINERS OVERTAKE WHITE SOX IN NINTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ At one point, they had too many baserunners milling
around second base and not enough runs. But the Mariners got
everything sorted out in the end, scoring twice in the bottom of
the ninth to beat the Chicago White Sox 4-3 Tuesday night at Safeco
Field.
</P>
<P>
   A near flawless game, interspersed by superb pitching and the
occasional home run, was settled when pinch-hitter Tom Lampkin
doubled off the right-field wall with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   After some confusion, pinch-runner John Mabry slid home with the
winning run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an odd moment, but it turned out OK,'' Lampkin said,
first calling the final play scary, then retracting that thought in
deference to his teammate.
</P>
<P>
   The second Safeco homestand concludes Wednesday when the
Mariners and White Sox meet in a 3:35 contest, the home club trying
to improve on a 7-5 record and two-game win streak before traveling
to Boston and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   With a sellout crowd of 43,696 watching intently, left-handers
Jamie Moyer and Mike Sirotka locked into pleasing pitchers' duel,
the Chicago youngster holding the upper hand most of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer (11-6) went the distance for the first time this season,
but looked to be a hardluck loser when he walked off the mound in
the ninth. He made one mistake, surrendering a three-run homer to
rookie Carlos Lee. But the Mariners were still one short, having
countered with just solo homers from Ken Griffey Jr. and David
Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's homer was his AL-leading 36th and the 386th of his
career. That left him 35th on the all-time list, three behind the
next guy on the rung, Johnny Bench. Bell's homer was his first in
nearly two months after hitting 15 in the season's first two
months.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of the long ball, Moyer was at his best, certainly never
in trouble. The only runners to touch third did so on a home run
trot. The veteran pitcher retired the side in order four times. He
struck out five, throwing just 104 pitches, 67 for strikes. He
deserved to win.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates must have sensed as much.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the inning, they made all the right moves _ and
one bad one that righted itself.
</P>
<P>
   Facing closer Bobby Howry and down 3-2, Edgar Martinez, drawing
a rare start at first base, walked on five pitches. Pitcher Frankie
Rodriguez came in as a pinch-runner. Jay Buhner worked the count to
2-2, then bounced a single between third and short.
</P>
<P>
   Little-used Rafael Bournigal, hitting for Ozzie Timmons, dropped
a bunt down the third-base line, moving the runners up and nearly
drawing a wild throw from Howry. Mabry was inserted for Buhner, now
at second. Dan Wilson was intentionally walked. Lampkin was
summoned to hit for Russ Davis.
</P>
<P>
   On the first pitch, the Mariners backup catcher drove the ball
deep to right. Everybody started running. Mabry, however, was the
only one going clockwise, returning to second to tag. He nearly got
run over by Wilson barreling into the base, with Lampkin on
Wilson's heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `What is this, the two stooges?''' Mariners
third-base coach Steve Smith said. ``If he was out, I would have
been the third stooge.''
</P>
<P>
   Added manager Lou Piniella with a wry smile, ``I heard the
third-base coach all the way from the dugout.''
</P>
<P>
   Mabry finally got turned around. He slid home after the ball
arrived from the outfield, but White Sox catcher Mark Johnson
couldn't hang on to it. Game over.
</P>
<P>
   Lampkin was looking for a fastball. Howry has been known to
throw them 97 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got lucky to get the good part of the bat on it,'' said
Lampkin, the Blanchet High alum. ``I learned a long time ago, from
Dusty Baker, when you're up there as a pinch-hitter, you're up
there to swing the bat. I heard Lou get upset the other day and
tell someone, `You didn't get a good swing.' I didn't want to get
on his bad side.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners were down a position player, the club stocking up
on an extra pitcher to offset the suspension of reliever Jose
Paniagua. Only utilityman Raul Ibanez was left on the bench, which
would have made for some interesting position changes had the game
gone into extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If John would have been thrown out, I would have had to play
infield,'' said Rodriguez, a reliever who came into pro ball as a
shortstop. ``I don't know where.''
</P>
<P>
   Yelled Davis at Lampkin, ``You're playing third tomorrow.''

SERENA IN CONTROL

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN BEACH _ Serena Williams went through a
mini-metamorphosis. She entered the stadium court Tuesday night
shaky, spraying errors as frequently as her braids shook. She left
the court confident, a winner.
</P>
<P>
   In her first singles match in two months, Williams beat Russian
Elena Likhovtseva, 4-6, 6-3, 6-1, in the Acura Classic at Manhattan
Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first set, I definitely got more confident as the
match went on,'' Williams said. ``... I think I was playing awesome
in practice. You should've of seen me. I was ready to go on the
men's tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyperbole aside, Williams did look strong in her final two sets.
She was especially dominant in the third set as she won 28 of the
set's 42 points.
</P>
<P>
   The first set, however, was quite the contrast. Tied 4-4,
Williams served with a 40-0 lead. She had five consecutive forced
errors to give the game to Likhovtseva. Williams agreed that she
was tentative in that set. She also agreed that she didn't get her
groove back until she led, 2-1, in the second set.
</P>
<P>
   Williams missed Wimbledon because, she said, she had a bad case
of the flu, which caused her to lose 10 pounds. In essence, then,
she was away from playing singles for two months because of the
flu.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people speculate, `Like where is she really?'''
Williams said. ``That's OK to me, to see that in the press.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of that mini-mystery, Williams is ranked 11th on the
WTA tour, even though this is only her ninth tournament. She glibly
mentioned this Tuesday and after a brief treatise on the rankings,
said, ``I'm saying if I'd play 20 (tournaments), I'd take the top
spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 17, is the sister of fourth-ranked Venus Williams and
will be missing more tournaments later this year. She plans to
enter college in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. at a fashion institute.
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams, by the way, did not enter the Acura Classic's
singles, but entered the doubles only to withdraw with her sister
Tuesday because of fatigue. That fatigue, however, didn't prevent
her from attending her sister's match.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Williams, the sisters' father, coached the two. He took
photos of Serena during her match. That may not noteworthy, except
that Serena was so relaxed after her return match that she stirred
the conversation to many things not tennis from the photos to her
dog to surfing in Florida on what she called the low-tide
``Atlantic Lake.''
</P>
<P>
   What could have made her father's pictures noteworthy was that
the renegade photographer used a flash, even though that's a no-no
at night tennis matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used a flash?'' Serena asked. ``I didn't see a flash at
all. I was really focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Serena continued to say that her father takes the photos, so she
can get ``a daily dose of me.'' She added that the photos are her
father's idea, even though it seemed like she doesn't mind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know in my house, there's going to be a lot of mirrors,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the conversation moved back to tennis and
Likhovtseva. Williams complimented her opponent, saying she
improved and could no longer be overpowered. Likhovtseva is a
finesse player, ranked 21st in the world. Her style contrasted the
grunt-oriented power of Williams.
</P>
<P>
   But without Williams making unforced errors, Likhovtseva's hopes
of winning Tuesday gradually were erased.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels great,'' Williams said to summarize her return. ``You
forget how it feels out here.''
</P>
<P>
   And others forget about her photos, dog and surfing.
</P>
<P>
   In another night match, German Anke Huber beat 18-year-old wild
card Alexandra Stevenson, 6-4, 6-4 in 64 minutes. Stevenson was in
her first match since being advancing to the Wimbledon semifinals
as a qualifier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I didn't play too great,'' Huber said. ``It's very
difficult to find a rhythm with a player like that. She has one
good shot and three that go anywhere. ... She has to keep the ball
in play more. She makes too many mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Huber, ranked 26th, will meet top-seeded Lindsay Davenport, the
tournament's defending champ. Even though Huber was ranked higher
than her 41st-ranked opponent, part of the night's focus was on
Stevenson, the daughter of basketball legend Julius Erving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still learning,'' Stevenson said. ``I have to learn not to
go for the great shots. I have to go for good shots, and then the
great shots.''

MICROSOFT, FEDS PAINT DIFFERING PICTURES  
  
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WASHINGTON _ In the latest phase of the Microsoft antitrust trial,
the Department of Justice and Microsoft offered starkly different
views Tuesday of the most basic facts in the government's case
against the software giant _ including whether the company is a
monopoly.
<P>
   The two sides submitted proposed ``findings of fact'' to U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is expected to review
the arguments over the next month as he decides whether Microsoft
violated antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Windows operating system is used on an estimated 90
percent of the world's personal computers, and the company is
accused of using its dominance to bully competitors and engaging in
predatory conduct. The question of whether the world's biggest
software-maker is a monopoly lies at the heart of a lawsuit that
could reshape the future of the high-tech industry and the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Although the findings of fact largely reiterate the volumes of
courtroom evidence presented during the 76-day trial, the
construction and force of the accompanying arguments are critical
to Jackson's ultimate verdict.
</P>
<P>
   In its 776-page filing, the Department of Justice, joined by 19
state attorneys general, attempted to lay the groundwork for the
court to consider extreme remedies, possibly even a breakup of the
company, to end what it called Microsoft's ``desktop paradise.''
</P>
<P>
   The government charged that 76 days of courtroom testimony and a
raft of internal e-mails, documents and other evidence demonstrate
beyond doubt that ``Microsoft has engaged in a broad pattern of
unlawful conduct with the purpose and effect of thwarting emerging
threats to its powerful and well-entrenched operating system
monopoly'' known to the world as Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among those threats, the government charged, was the
competing Internet browser sold by Netscape, which the Justice
Department accused Microsoft of trying to squelch, in part by
including its own browser free as part of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   But the government said the company also acted against a string
of Silicon Valley heavyweights that it considered ``actual or
potential middleware cq  &LR;  threats to its operating system monopoly,
including Sun Microsystem's Java, Intel's Native Signal Processing,
and Apple's QuickTime.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft countered in its 453-page filing that recent changes
in the computer industry, especially America Online's buyout of
Netscape, prove that the government's case is fundamentally
misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Events of the last 15 months have made it painfully obvious
that Microsoft does not possess monopoly power _ the ability to
control prices or exclude competitors _ in a `market' narrowly
defined as operating systems for Intel-compatible computers,'' the
company argued.
</P>
<P>
   The company contended that the government harbors a deeply
misguided ``static'' view of the computing world, which instead, it
says, is defined by `'the sort of relentless innovation that occurs
at Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also argued that the government failed to show harm to
consumers, an essential element of an antitrust finding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite vociferous complaints from a parade of Microsoft's
rivals _ who obviously would prefer less vigorous competition _
there was remarkably little evidence about the impact of
Microsoft's actions on consumers, who are, after all, the intended
beneficiaries of antitrust law,'' the company argued.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft accused the government of expanding the case far
beyond its original charges regarding Netscape's browser, to bring
in what it called irrelevant charges that other companies suffered
unfairly at Microsoft's hands. Microsoft argued that Apple, Intel,
Sun and IBM all continue to thrive, despite the government's
accusations that Microsoft is bent on destroying them.
</P>
<P>
   The company also dismissed what the government characterized as
damning internal e-mails and other documents highlighted during the
trial _ such as the e-mail from a Microsoft executive threatening
to ``cut off Netscape's air supply.''
</P>
<P>
   Such documents merely reflect the intensity of high-tech
competition, the company argued, that ``often manifests itself in
tough bargaining and spirited dialogue in internal
communications.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides have until September 10 to submit rebuttals. On
September 21, Jackson will hear closing oral arguments before
ultimately issuing his own factual findings of fact, including his
decision about whether Microsoft is a monopoly, which is essential
to finding antitrust violations.
</P>
<P>
   The fact findings are key to any appeal, because appellate
courts seldom challenge a trial judge's decisions on the facts of a
case, limiting their reviews to findings of law.

BERKELEY LAB ASKED TO REPAY $800,000 USED IN RESEARCH  &HT;       
   
  
</HEADLINE>
   By TANYA SCHEVITZ 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
BERKELEY, Calif. _ The National Cancer Institute is demanding that
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory repay more than $800,000 in
federal grant money used by a lab researcher who allegedly
falsified data suggesting electromagnetic fields may cause cancer.
<P>
   But the lab, which reported the case to the federal government,
is appealing the call for repayment of the grant used by Robert P.
Liburdy in developing data that he reported in two scientific
journals in 1992, said lab spokesman Ron Kolb. The data was used to
advance a research proposal and secure federal funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The institution was brave enough to question the validity of
some findings,'' Kolb said. ``We took a stand, and we believe this
is a chilling message to other institutions who are expected to
police themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The data purported to show the first plausible biological
mechanism linking electromagnetic fields exposure to cancer and
other diseases, including childhood leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   However, the federal Office of Research Integrity, an arm of the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, reported that a
two-year investigation of Liburdy found that he committed
``scientific misconduct'' by ``intentionally falsifying and
fabricating'' data and claims of cellular effects from electric and
magnetic fields in two journal articles.
</P>
<P>
   Liburdy, 51, agreed in May with that office to retract three
data graphs he used to back up his conclusions in two 1992 journal
articles.
</P>
<P>
   The Tiburon resident, who resigned from his 15-year position at
the lab in March after officials there blocked grant proposals for
further funding, also agreed to a three-year ban on receiving
federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   He denies any wrongdoing and has said he agreed to the sanctions
imposed by the Office of Research Integrity only because he could
not afford a lengthy legal battle. He insists that the overall
conclusions of the articles remain valid and will not be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   A letter sent this month by the National Cancer Institute's
grants chief to Lawrence Berkeley lab officials said the agency
wants the lab to repay $804,321 in grant money that supported
research Liburdy conducted between Jan. 1, 1991 and March 31, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NCI considers the tampered data to be central to the
project; therefore, charges to the grant for the tampered data and
for all subsequent research, which was based on that data, did not
further the purpose of the award and are unallowable,'' the letter
said.''
</P>
<P>
   Kolb said lab officials believe that they are being penalized
for investigating and reporting the case. Lawrence Berkeley lab
reviewed Liburdy's findings after a postdoctoral student working
with him challenged his results in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1995, the lab concluded that Liburdy had deliberately
falsified data, and the lab alerted the Office of Research
Integrity.
</P>
<P>
   No one from the National Cancer Institute was available for
comment, but according to the letter, the agency is just following
its policy to seek recovery of funds in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   The letter says the institute reviewed the case and made the
decision July 6 following release of the investigation results.
However, the lab's notification of the decision on August 3 comes
on the heels of a July 28 letter to the National Cancer Institute
from the House Committee on Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The July letter, citing a story on the case in The Chronicle,
requested an accounting of efforts to recover the research funds.
</P>
<P>
   Kolb said the Lawrence Berkeley lab always planned to return a
$360,858 unspent balance from the $2.39 million granted to Liburdy
between 1990 and 1999 by the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   The institute is not seeking repayment of grants paid to Liburdy
for research that is not in question.
</P>
<P>
   For the past several years, Liburdy has been researching the
effects of electromagnetic fields on breast cancer cells and
lymphocytes, Kolb said.

CLOSE ENCOUNTER WITH A WHITE-HOT TRAIL OF COMET DUST  
   
   
  
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL;
<P>
   This is the week of the annual Perseid meteor shower, when
Earth's orbit around the sun carries it through the dusty remains
of an ancient comet.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday and Thursday night, watchers in California and around
the world can track the myriad tiny points of light that mark the
Perseid meteors as they vaporize in a white-hot encounter with the
outer atmosphere, 50 to 80 miles above the Earth's surface. The
show can be observed all night long.
</P>
<P>
   Long, long ago, a comet named Swift-Tuttle passed so close to
the sun that much of its icy head melted away, leaving a stream of
pea-sized particles. That primordial rubble _ the very material
that formed the solar system itself, more than 4 billion years ago
_ has left a trail that now stretches for hundreds of millions of
miles, and the Earth passes through it every year in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can see the Perseids from an unobstructed vantage point _
the darker the better, says Andrew Fraknoi, director of the
Astronomy Program at Foothill College in Los Altos Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Meteor hunters should be patient and wait outdoors for at least
15 minutes to give their eyes time to adjust to the dark, Fraknoi
advised. Binoculars and telescopes are no use at all, he noted,
because the meteor tracks can flash unexpectedly anywhere across
the entire sky, from horizon to horizon.
</P>
<P>
   The meteors are called Perseids because scientists have noted
that they appear to come from the direction of the constellation
Perseus. Although the annual event is called a ``meteor shower,''
watchers will probably only spot between 40 or 50 to 100 an hour,
and nothing at all like fireworks, Fraknoi says.
</P>
<P>
   Ancient Chinese records first described an August meteor shower
that must have been the Perseids in 36 A.D., and they have been
observed by scientists through the centuries. Calculations of the
orbit of Comet Swift-Tuttle led astronomers a decade ago to predict
that the comet might crash into the Earth on August 14, 2126. Such
a collision would result in monstrous destruction, and perhaps even
the extinction of the human race _ just as dinosaurs and many other
species were destroyed when an asteroid or comet collided with
Earth about 65 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the prediction proved wrong, and Swift-Tuttle seems
destined for a far longer life. But one far-off day, perhaps many
millennia from now, according to astronomers at the Royal Greenwich
Observatory in England, that crash is almost sure to come.

ABORTION RIGHTS ACTIVISTS THREATEN TO FLUSH BUSH OUT OF THE WOODS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ California's abortion rights activists have
vowed to step up pressure dramatically on GOP candidates in the
2000 presidential race _ especially front-runner George W. Bush.
<P>
   Calling the Texas governor ``the most anti-abortion governor in
the United States,'' some 400 members of the California Abortion
and Reproductive Rights Action League met in San Francisco last
week to launch their ``Choice 2000'' drive.
</P>
<P>
   The effort is aimed at fund-raising and organizing to ``maintain
a pro-choice majority in the state Assembly and elect a pro-choice
president,'' said Belle Taylor-McGhee, president of CARAL. ``In
this state the majority of Republicans are pro-choice,'' she said.
``It's going to be a major issue.''
</P>
<P>
   With seven months before the March 2000 presidential primary,
abortion could become a key issue in the nation's most populous
state, which will be a crucial battleground in the general
election. Pro-choice activists in California say that Bush will be
the focus of much of their efforts, and that they intend to pound
his record on issues of reproductive rights.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor-McGhee cited 18 pieces of legislation signed by Bush in
the past year which she said has dramatically affected women and
girl's health care and contraceptive services. CARAL and its
national arm, the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action
League, has already targeted Bush's record on reproductive rights
in ads running in key states like Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says he is a compassionate conservative _ but if women
don't have access to safe and legal services, how compassionate is
that?'' said Emily Lyons, a nurse who nearly died in the bombing of
a Birmingham, Ala., clinic in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons, who spoke at CARAL's San Francisco gathering, said she
considers the 2000 election ``a turning point'' because the next
president could have an opportunity to appoint two or more Supreme
Court justices. ``It will be either a step forward, or a return to
the back alley days.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Mulholland, campaign adviser to the state Democratic Party,
said that the anti-abortion position taken by every GOP
presidential candidate will make it hard for any of them to win
over state voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these Republicans will be eaten up in California, the most
pro-choice state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that by solid majorities, both Republicans and
Democrats in California back a woman's right to obtain an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the most recent Field polls show that nearly
two-thirds of California voters either want to keep existing
abortion laws or favor even less restrictive laws. Among Democrats,
the number rises to 73 percent, while 57 percent of Republicans are
on the pro-choice side.
</P>
<P>
   Those voters include people like Kisten Hesse, an East Bay
marketing consultant who attended the pro-choice organizing meeting
last week. Hesse said a candidate's position on reproductive rights
is a key factor in deciding how she'll vote. ``If a candidate won't
support that personal choice,'' she said, ``it's an indicator of
their ideals and beliefs in a lot of other areas.''
</P>
<P>
   One GOP presidential candidate suggested that the polls do not
accurately reflect the views of most state voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've traveled a lot in California, and I don't think
California is any different from the rest of the country (on
abortion),'' conservative commentator Gary Bauer told The Chronicle
in an interview this week. ``Most Americans are seriously disturbed
by 1.5 million abortions a year ... they're very prepared to listen
to (ideas) about restricting abortion, and to listen to principaled
arguments about why America shouldn't be where it is.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bauer has been vocally opposed to abortion, he _ like the
pro-choice activists _ has taken to aiming barbs at Bush on the
issue. of abortion. Bauer maintained that, in a story in the most
recent issue of ``Talk'' magazine, Bush failed to stand strong for
a pro-life position, and instead illustrated a ``cavalier attitude
toward some life and death issues,'' including abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bauer, many of the pro-choice activists meeting in San
Francisco expressed frustration that Bush has been successful, at
least so far, in sidestepping the abortion issue.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent four-day trip to California, the Texas governor was
pressed by reporters on his record. He said he has long been
``pro-life,'' but refused to rule out a pro-choice vice
presidential candidate and said he would employ no ``litmus test''
on abortion in appointing Supreme Court judges. But Bush has also
downplayed the issue, saying education, taxes and the economy rank
as more critical to voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't keep doing that forever ... the voters aren't
stupid,'' said Stephanie Dart, a technical support engineer who
attended the abortion rights meeting in San Francisco. ``We all
know what he means when he says that ... he doesn't want to talk
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But pro-choice activists may find plenty of political opposition
to their efforts. Anti-abortion activists promise to counter their
efforts with their own fund-raising and activism in the 2000 race.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Spence, vice president of the California Pro-Life
Council, defended what he called Bush's ``pro-life record,'' and
said his organization will also communicate ``the message of life''
to voters. The Pro-Life Council will talking about issues like
``partial birth (abortion), parental notification, ending taxpayers
subsidies (on abortion) and adoption instead of abortion,'' he
said. ``That message resonates with voters.''
</P>
<P>
   And Randy Thomasson, spokesman for the Sacramento-based Capitol
Resource Institute, a conservative family advocacy group, predicted
that Democratic Vice President Al Gore _ who was dogged by
anti-abortion demonstrators on his last California trip _ will also
be a target for protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore supports the abortion agenda, (though) he used to be
pro-life,'' he said. ``He changed for political expediency.''
</P>
<P>
   But both sides agree that if the activists are as persistent in
raising the issue _ and cash _ as they promise, all presidential
candidates may have to face questions on abortion more frequently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Choice is an issue with the voters,'' said Oakland health care
professional Cynthia Carey Grant at the CARAL gathering. ``And
anyone who says it's not is out of touch.''  &LR;

BY HARRISON SHEPPARD,  
 PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 AND ROBERT MONROE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Without saying a word, a middle-age, balding
white gunman stormed the North Valley Jewish Community Center on
Tuesday and sprayed about 70 shots in the lobby and hallway,
wounding three children and two staff members.
</P>
<P>
   He fled on foot to a waiting van and drove off, eluding a
massive task force of police and FBI agents during a daylong effort
to track him down. The attacker left five wounded and a mystery as
to his motive.
</P>
<P>
   Panicked parents of the nearly 300 children at the day camp
raced to the area where they had emotional reunions with their
children at a nearby temple.
</P>
<P>
   As the gunfire erupted about 10:45 a.m., children scrambled
under desks and teachers locked their doors and tried to hide
youngsters as the attacker unleashed a burst of rounds from a 9 mm
automatic weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard about 30 to 40 bullets,'' said a 36-year-old North
Hollywood woman who glimpsed the gunman when the shooting began.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then he ran outside. I thought he might see me in the
classroom, so I shut the shades and hid,'' she said. ``A little boy
was lying on the ground. He was bleeding. And it looked like we
were losing him.''
</P>
<P>
   The receptionist, 68-year-old Isabelle Shalometh, was among the
first to see the balding gunman as he strode in with an Uzi machine
gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``She saw him coming at her _ and he just started firing,'' said
Shalometh's daughter, Lucille Shalometh Goldin, 40, of Calabasas.
``She knew enough to get down and crawl into the back office.''
</P>
<P>
   Before she could hide, bullets grazed her left arm and back. She
was released after treatment.
</P>
<P>
   A 5-year-old boy standing in the hall was hit in the left leg
and stomach. He is reported in fair condition. A 6-year-old boy
struck in the foot was treated and released to his parents.
</P>
<P>
   Bullets pierced walls and ricocheted, hitting another 6-year-old
boy and a 16-year-old female camp counselor. Both were in stable
condition at hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   And then as suddenly as the gunman appeared, he left the
building and disappeared. Later, a woman reported that a man
carjacked her green Toyota Corolla after abandoning a red van with
Washington state plates and laden with ammunition, a flak jacket
and survivalist books.
</P>
<P>
   Police, working with agents from the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms, began a methodical search of the neighborhood
with dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can run, but you can't hide,'' said Los Angeles police
Cmdr. David Kalish. ``We have a lot of resources. It's just a
matter of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Several minutes after the 911 call came in at 10:49 a.m.,
officers arrived at the school to find a 16-year-old staff member
lying on the ground with wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no idea what was going on,'' said Training Officer Carl
Oschmann. ``They said there were children with various injuries in
different parts of the school.''
</P>
<P>
   In the nursery school room, a boy lay wounded. ``He seemed
rather calm. He had a look of concern. I think he was awestruck by
the sight of us and all our guns,'' Oschmann said.
</P>
<P>
   While police secured the building and searched for the gunman,
paramedics removed the injured.
</P>
<P>
   Frantic parents soon crowded the police security line a short
distance away, trying to find their children. One man was briefly
detained after he broke through the tape, but was later released.
</P>
<P>
   Children were led hand in hand to the nearby Temple Beth Torah,
where they were reunited with their parents. Panic-stricken parents
ran down Rinaldi Street, as close as they could get to the school,
then wept and hugged each other, yelling frantically into cell
phones.
</P>
<P>
   A woman screamed, ``I don't know where he is'' into a cell
phone. One child rested in his father's arms trying to explain the
unexplainable: ``There was a bad guy,'' he concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen panicked preschoolers and teachers fled next door to
the Rinaldi Convalescent Hospital. A 6-year-old boy with shrapnel
in his left foot was among those seeking refuge, said administrator
David Hibarger.
</P>
<P>
   ``His shoe was off and he was crying,'' said Hibarger, who had
nurses tend to the injured boy.
</P>
<P>
   To help calm down the frightened group, Hibarger ordered the
hospital's head cook to prepare grilled cheese sandwiches and
orange juice. ``They're sitting on the floor and one of the
counselors is playing the piano.''
</P>
<P>
   (CONTINUED ON NEXT TAKE)
</P>
<P>
   X X X
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: playing the piano.''
</P>
<P>
   With no suspect in custody and no apparent motive, parents and
employees struggled to understand why anyone would just randomly
open fire on a building full of children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just so unbelievable,'' said Laurel Wolf, a former
teacher at the Jewish Community Center who lives nearby. ``Why? Why
would somebody be so crazy to do this? It's frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   SWAT team officers with dogs methodically searched the
neighborhood, sweeping through buildings and back yards with their
guns pointed forward.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the confusion were conflicting descriptions of the
gunmen from witnesses shaken by the experience. Police first
thought the suspect was a teen-ager, but then described him as a
40-year-old white man who is bald and wearing green or black
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes after the shooting, a man fitting the gunman's
description hijacked a car near Van Nuys Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The man pulled the woman out of her car at Roscoe Boulevard and
Woodley Avenue, stole her car, and left her and the van behind,
police said. The van held some 5,000 rounds of 9 mm ammunition, a
flak jacket, a smoke grenade and survival gear.
</P>
<P>
   About 5:30 p.m., police found the Corolla outside the 7-Star
Suites Hotel in Chatsworth. Special weapons and tactics team
officers cordoned off the area in the belief that he was barricaded
in a room.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish Community Center runs a summer day-care program, a
camp and a preschool, with roughly 300 children in the building on
a typical day, according to executive director Jeff Rouss.
Twenty-two children were away on a field trip.
</P>
<P>
   Rouss said they had no warning that something like this would
happen, and it has prompted Jewish Community Centers throughout the
region to re-evaluate their security measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so sad what happened here today,'' Rouss said. ``We're a
place of fun and recreation and learning and caring.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parents and an official of the Anti-Defamation League said
they previously had some doubts about the center's security.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always telling people that we need more security at that
building,'' said Aaron Levinson, director of the ADL's Valley
office.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin, the daughter of the 68-year-old receptionist, said the
Jewish center is a popular family gathering spot for classes,
programs and other activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't go to the Jewish center and be safe, where can
you go and be safe anymore? There's nowhere.''

   FOOD-TEA-KANSAS (undated) _ When Granny served iced tea on the
front porch, the refreshing brew typically came in two flavors:
sweetened and unsweetened. Sure, she might add a squeeze of lemon.
Or if she was feeling really fancy-schmancy, a sprig of mint.
</P>
<P>
   But as we teeter on the brink of a new millennium, iced tea is
taking the New Age plunge, offering a host of new flavors designed
to please a generation weaned on sticky-sweet soda pop.
</P>
<P>
   A younger, health-conscious tea consumer is turning to hip new
brews with exotic flavors ranging from SoBe's Lemon Tea flavored
with lemon grass to Honest Tea's Moroccan Mint, a blend of green
tea with peppermint and ``barely sweetened'' with white clover
honey, to Tejava, a ``premium'' iced tea that is microbrewed from
leaves handpicked on the remote island of Java. By JILL WENDHOLT

   HEALTH-JUNKFOOD-KANSAS (undated) _ ``Mommy, can I have some

<P>
   ``No,'' you say, convinced that in denying your child junk food,
you're promoting proper eating habits and doing your child good.
</P>
<P>

otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   According to two studies led by Penn State nutritionist Jennifer
Orlet Fisher and published this summer in the American Journal of
Clinical Nutrition and the journal Appetite, restricting a child's
consumption of junk food is more likely to cause a child to want
junk food that much more and, most significantly, to eat more of it
when the opportunity arises. By ERIC ADLER. 400 words. Story will

RESTRICT THE JUNK FOOD AND MAKE THEM JUNKIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC ADLER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Mommy, can I have some candy? Can I have a soda? Can I have
some ice cream?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' you say, convinced that in denying your child junk food,
you're promoting proper eating habits and doing your child good.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Mom, hold on to your cookies. Recent research indicates
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   According to two studies led by Penn State nutritionist Jennifer
Orlet Fisher and published this summer in the American Journal of
Clinical Nutrition and the journal Appetite, restricting a child's
consumption of junk food is more likely to cause a child to want
junk food that much more and, most significantly, to eat more of it
when the opportunity arises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically,'' Fischer said, ``we were interested in looking at
the age-old question of whether children want more of what they
can't have.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, the studies show, is yes.
</P>
<P>
   One four-week study looked at 37 preschool children. Over the
course of the study, the children were given wheat crackers and
Pepperidge Farms' Gold Fish crackers to eat during their 15-minute
snack time. The children were allowed to eat as much of either
cracker as they liked, which they did.
</P>
<P>
   After two weeks, however, Fisher changed the experimental
conditions. During the 15-minute snack period, the children could
still eat as many wheat crackers as they wanted but the Gold Fish
were restricted. The children were told they could eat the Gold
Fish crackers for only 5 minutes of each period. They could see the
crackers but weren't allowed to touch them.
</P>
<P>
   The result was that in those 5 minutes, the children practically
devoured the Gold Fish, eating 20 percent more as before.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher's conclusion on restrictions: ``We think it might have
the opposite effects parents intend it to have. It increases the
desire to obtain and eat those foods.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in a second study of 71 preschool boys and girls,
published in the June issue of Appetite, Fisher first gave the
children's parents a questionnaire about how restrictive they were
regarding 10 foods, ranging from cookies to ice cream to popcorn to
candies. She found that those children, primarily girls, whose
parents who were most restrictive ate more of those junk foods when
given the opportunity, compared with children whose parents were
less restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in a third study yet to be published but presented in
July to the Society for the Study for Ingestive Behaviors, Fisher
looked at the effect of restrictions on 158 5-year-old girls. She
found that girls whose parents are most restrictive not only ate
more junk food when they had the opportunity but also felt
significantly worse about themselves afterward than did girls whose
parents were less restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   The point: There's nothing wrong with watching what children eat
and making sure they eat well. But if you're looking to promote
good dietary habits, moderation and judicious choices may be better
than strict rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (strict restrictions) may work in the short term,'' Fisher
said. ``But later when children are able to make their own choices,
restrictions may have negative effects.''

 &HT;    Cell phone ban to get another try in Ohio
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Cellular phones and cars _ a way of life for
some drivers and a road rage recipe for others.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you like them or not, don't count on Ohio telling people
that can't use them on the highways.
</P>
<P>
   A state lawmaker this fall will again push for legislation to
restrict use of cellular phones while operating certain motor
vehicles. State Rep. Catherine Barrett (D-Cincinnati) said she will
ask the House Transportation and Public Safety Committee for
another hearing on her bill, which was introduced this year and
failed to move through the Ohio General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by how other states have handled similar legislation,
Barrett may not have much better luck this time around.
</P>
<P>
   Recent efforts to place legal restrictions on auto cell phone
use have been shot down in 22 states, according to the National
Conference of State Legislatures. As is the case with Barrett's
bill, legislation in those 22 states ``died in committee'',
according to an NCSL survey. In Maryland lawmakers tried to bar the
use of cell phones in moving vehicles. In Texas, legislators tried
to create a criminal charge of ``using a telephone while operating
a motor vehicle.'' And in Virginia lawmakers wanted to ban cell
phone use among schoolbus drivers on the road. All failed.
</P>
<P>
   Most Ohio lawmakers seem in no hurry to ban cell phone use in
cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone wants to ignore the concern for the
issue, but there hasn't been a lot of support for the bill at this
time,'' said state Rep. Jeff Jacobson, R-Phillipsburg.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. is expected to have more than 80 million cell phone
users in 2000. The concern that auto cell phone use was endangering
people on the road intensified this year following several federal
studies. Using a cell phone while driving quadruples the risk of
collision, one report said.
</P>
<P>
   Cell phones can reduce response times to accident scenes and
save lives, but the associated risks put motorists in danger and
outweigh the benefits, according to studies published in the New
England Journal of Medicine .
</P>
<P>
   Only California, Florida and Massachusetts have laws that
address using cell phones in vehicles.

 &HT;    Guy statement: 100 of us in La-Z-Boys watching football
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ I've landed the perfect spot to hold The Remote,
my unique performance art show that will feature 100 guys sitting
around in BarcaLoungers and La-Z-Boys, watching football on
television.
</P>
<P>
   It's the Hog-Eye Bait House out on Decker Lake, about 12 miles
northeast of downtown Austin.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to plan, at 10 a.m. Friday, Nov. 26, 100
guys will make a guy statement by sitting in easy chairs on the lot
next to the bait shop while watching the Texas-Texas A&AMP;M game on
the tube.
</P>
<P>
   I picked Texas-Texas A&AMP;M because it's a huge game. And I want my
show to get international press coverage. One hundred guys in easy
chairs next to a bait shop watching Rice might be ignored by the
media.
</P>
<P>
   You couldn't find a better place for 100 guys to watch TV than
the Hog-Eye Bait House.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so the Playboy Mansion would be better. But the Hog-Eye Bait
House has a partly vacant lot next to it that is large enough to
accommodate 100 guys in easy chairs.
</P>
<P>
   So Tuesday, I drove out to the Hog-Eye Bait House and explained
the artistic concept of The Remote to Al Macchi, the bait shop's
owner. Al has never been to an opera, but he seemed to like my idea
anyway. In fact, he said some of his customers might take part.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these guys will do anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Al added that hooking up some TVs for the performance should be
easy. ``I've got five outlets,'' he said. ``We'll find some way to
run a cable out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Before I forget, I'd like to invite Margery Segal, producer of
The Bridge, the recent performance art show involving 100 women
dancing and reciting poetry on Austin's Congress Avenue Bridge, to
come out to the Hog-Eye Bait House and review my show. Since I made
fun of her show, I figure it's only fair that she get a chance to
rip me. I don't want to be accused of being a misogynist. Shoot,
I've never even been to a misoge parlor.
</P>
<P>
   If you're interested in becoming one of the 100 performance
artists in my show, keep your eyes trained on this column. We will
have tryouts in a few weeks for those 100 positions. I'll announce
the location of the tryouts later. We'll set up a few easy chairs
and let guys take turns showing their leaning-back prowess and
other BarcaLounger skills. Participants will be judged on their
spoken word talents and will be asked to recite lines such as,
``Come on, Arlene, I just mowed that lawn five weeks ago,'' ``Hey,
sweetie, since you're up, why don't you go to the store and pick up
a 12-pack?'' and ``You kids clam up; the game's about to start.''
</P>
<P>
   The Remote will need musical accompaniment, so I called Peter
Bay, conductor of the Austin Symphony Orchestra. I'm still waiting
to hear back. On the other hand, songwriter, singer and author
Kinky Friedman says he will be a judge at the tryouts.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Kinky, who wrote a song called ``Ol' Ben Lucas Had a Lot
of Mucus'' when he was 11, what he thought of the concept of The
Remote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, visionary,'' he said. ``Sparkles with insight. It's the
kind of thing more people ought to be getting involved in, I think.
I'm certainly glad to give my time to something like this.''

 &HT;    Boy Scouts' badge of tolerance yet to be earned
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ There are many reasons my husband and I wanted
our son involved in Scouting. If I had to sum it up in one word,
that word would be values.
</P>
<P>
   Self-reliance. Cooperation. Conservation. Respect.
</P>
<P>
   Now, under the banner of values, local Scout leaders are
supporting _ with more than obligatory enthusiasm _ the Boy Scouts
of America's ban on homosexuals as leaders or members. ``The BSA
place a strong emphasis on traditional family values, as being
necessary components of a strong healthy individual,'' said Ken
Wade, executive director of the Miami Valley Council.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional family values? Sounds like good old-fashioned
prejudice to me. And that's not a value I want my son to be taught.
</P>
<P>
   Segregation used to be traditional in America. So did the
disenfranchisement of women and blacks. (The Boy Scouts practiced
de facto segregation for much of its hstory, acknowledged national
spokesman Gregg Shields: ``We changed as America changed.'')
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the New Jersey Supreme Court, ruling in favor of
ousted Scout leader James Dale, decreed that the BSA's exclusion of
gay boys and leaders violates a state anti-discrimination law. The
BSA will appeal, national spokesman Gregg Shields said.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar case in California, Wade pointed out, the Supreme
Court ruled in favor of the Scouts. ``We are a private membership
organization,'' Wade said.
</P>
<P>
   Debate all you want about whether a private organization has the
legal right to decide its membership. The Scouts should be a better
organization than to discriminate in this matter.
</P>
<P>
   Does the BSA believe gays are more likely to be pedophiles or to
promote their sexual lifestyle? Wade strongly denied that's the
reason.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the issue? I asked Wade. Why not simply enforce
uniform standards of conduct?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Scout oath mandates that Scouts be morally straight,''
Wade said.
</P>
<P>
   I pointed out that the oath most likely didn't refer to the
current use of the term.
</P>
<P>
   The affable Wade laughed in spite of himself. ``We aren't saying
that homosexuals don't have good values,'' he said. ``We're saying
that, based on the traditional values of Scouting, we believe the
homosexual is not an appropriate role model. We wouldn't want
leaders who were alcoholics, for instance.''
</P>
<P>
   I wonder how his words will affect gay teen-agers struggling
with their sexual identity.
</P>
<P>
   And what will it teach other Scouts? I don't want my son to
enter the workplace with the misconception it's OK to discriminate
against gays and lesbians. Many larger states, by statute, offer
equal protection for gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   We're not going to pull Alec out of the Cub Scouts. This is his
first year. He loves it. But at some point we'll have to tell him
we don't subscribe to all Scout policies.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope Wade grows into a more tolerant position. Wade,
executive director for only a year, already appears to have
restored confidence in the organization's financial stability. This
anti-gay stance is beneath his leadership, and beneath the
traditions of the BSA.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps I should refer them to one of their own Scout manuals.
Under the chapter, ``What Makes America Special?'' the Bear
handbook states, ``Americans believe everyone should be free and
should control his or her own life. We have the right to own
property and to worship any way we want. Our laws protect each of
us equally.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless they take those words to heart, the Boy Scouts of America
won't win any merit badges for tolerance.

 &HT;    Will `my' storm stir things up or fizzle and drift?
 &HT;    By Emily C. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Remember Arlene?
</P>
<P>
   I don't either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't I remember that storm?'' I asked my new friend Frank
Lepore, a spokesman for the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many things to invade the mind,'' Frank tells me. ``The
kids need braces, saccharin is causing cancer.'' Gee. Frank's not
even a procrastinating mother with a school supply list neatly
tucked in his wallet, and still he gets the picture.
</P>
<P>
   I called Lepore to thank him because my name is on the hurricane
list this year. Turns out, this is no small deal. Frank says 25
member countries had to get together to approve me for that list.
``They're all part of the World Meteorological Organization,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   I must admit, I've been a little nervous since I found out last
spring I'd made the cut. My friend Lenny's on there, too, and I'm
hoping he doesn't lumber along and then peter out, because therein
lies the problem:
</P>
<P>
   You walk a fine line when you're a hurricane. You don't want to
be vicious or mighty _ you might hurt someone _ but you don't want
to be a wimp. Like Arlene was back in June.
</P>
<P>
   Arlene ``fizzled'' the day after she was formed, then
``weakened'' and ``drifted.'' After that, she ``sputtered out to
sea.'' Indeed, the most memorable thing Arlene did was ``skirt
Bermuda.'' And she won't be back until 2005, because once you're a
named storm, that's how long it takes to get back in the rotation,
Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Frank, you should hear his slick talk when there's
nothing tropical forming off the coast. Here's a guy who uses
phrases such as ``sea surface temperatures'' and ``convected
cycles'' the way you or I might toss out such everyday sentences as
``Pick up your room right now'' and ``Not tonight, honey, I'm
tired.''
</P>
<P>
   But because I don't have enough to worry about, I steered Frank
back to the real purpose of my call. Am I going to happen at all?
</P>
<P>
   Frank told me to stop fretting.
</P>
<P>
   I'm fifth on the list, and Frank says we have an average of 10
named storms every year. Last year, this time, we'd had only Alex,
who lasted from July 27 to Aug. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Aug. 19, Hurricane Bonnie formed. She's become my idol
because she had a decent personality _ stirred things up and caused
a bit of a worry _ but she wasn't mean.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie was followed by Tropical Storm Charlie on the 21st, then
Hurricane Danielle on the 24th, Earl on Aug. 31 and Frances on
Sept. 8.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Frank what the mood was like down there in Miami, what
with this being the true calm before the storm. He said they're
busy even when the waters are quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot imagine the amount of data that has to be reviewed
to arrive at a forecast,'' Frank told me. ``And we're responsible
for aviation marine forecasts for the Atlantic and a good part of
the Pacific.''
</P>
<P>
   And the forecasters?
</P>
<P>
   ``They're like thoroughbred racehorses,'' Frank said. ``They
just want to do their job.''
</P>
<P>
   Racehorses. I like that.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Emily will race up the coast, cause a little mischief,
then skip out to sea. That would be good. But whatever happens,
whether I fizzle or lumber or hammer or chug _ one thing is for
certain. I'm splurging on Spam this year. Yeehaw!

EXOTIC FLAVORS ARE HEATING UP THE BOTTLED TEA MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL WENDHOLT SILVA  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Granny served iced tea on the front porch, the refreshing
brew typically came in two flavors: sweetened and unsweetened.
Sure, she might add a squeeze of lemon. Or if she was feeling
really fancy-schmancy, a sprig of mint.
</P>
<P>
   But as we teeter on the brink of a new millennium, iced tea is
taking the New Age plunge, offering a host of new flavors designed
to please a generation weaned on sticky-sweet soda pop.
</P>
<P>
   A younger, health-conscious tea consumer is turning to hip new
brews with exotic flavors ranging from SoBe's Lemon Tea flavored
with lemon grass to Honest Tea's Moroccan Mint, a blend of green
tea with peppermint and ``barely sweetened'' with white clover
honey, to Tejava, a ``premium'' iced tea that is microbrewed from
leaves handpicked on the remote island of Java.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the marketing savvy of Snapple and Arizona brand iced
teas, the stagnant ready-to-drink iced tea market began booming in
the early '90s. Today many beverage makers are pushing the
definition of iced tea to its outer limits with variations such as
chai, a spiced, milk-based tea that can be served hot or over ice
and tea-based granitas such as Jet Tea, a smoothie beverage with
the merest hint of green tea. (See related story.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The specialty tea industry has been buzzing for the last few
years,'' says Rivers Janssen, editor of the Portland, Ore.-based
trade magazine Fresh Cup. ``People are becoming aware that tea has
a lot more complexity than the Earl Grey tea bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Every day about half the American population drinks tea, and 85
percent of those tea drinkers pour theirs over ice. No surprise
then that the ready-to-drink iced tea market has become the
fastest-growing segment of the tea trade. Sales for the category
jumped from $200 million in 1990 to $1.75 billion in 1997,
according to the Tea Council of the U.S.A.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly three decades, ready-to-drink iced teas were
typically sold in cans, says Joe Simrany, the council's president.
It took a move to a see-through bottle and the marketing genius of
an innovative company such as Snapple to give tea a quirky, readily
identifiable image.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Snapple did was they managed to bring new life to the
category,'' Simrany says. ``And it's still going strong. Its
competition is soft drinks, and just like soft drinks, there's no
end in sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Going green
</P>
<P>
   Between 1990 and 1996, tea consumption more than doubled in the
United States. The increase coincides with widely reported health
benefits of tea as an antioxidant, a substance that helps prevent
damage to cells and tissues that contribute to diseases such as
cancer and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't market these facts, but people are aware of these
studies,'' says Seth Goldman, ``Tea-EO'' and co-founder of Honest
Tea, a year-old Maryland-based company.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed as a ``wellness'' beverage, the health-conscious customer
is willing to pay an extra 50 or 60 cents per bottle for a premium
product with perceived health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Unsweetened tea is virtually calorie-free and contains no
sodium, fat or sugar. Sweetened varieties can range from a mere 17
calories to a whopping 200 calories per 8-ounce serving.
</P>
<P>
   Although all three types of teas _ black, green and oolong _ are
reported to have health benefits, green tea is especially high in
antioxidants prompting many brands to add a green iced tea to their
lines. Some observers insist green tea is an acquired taste that is
``too grassy'' for mainstream consumers, but even tea giant Lipton
has added a green tea to its lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Some brands, such as Snapple and SoBe, also are pumping up the
health benefits of their beverages by adding ``neutriceuticals'' or
medicinal herbs such as ginseng, gingko biloba, guarana,
schizandra, bee pollen and kava kava.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is to add neutriceutical levels that are beneficial to
the body yet don't taste ``like you're drinking castor oil,'' says
John Bello, CEO of South Beach Beverage Co., the maker of SoBe.
</P>
<P>
   How sweet the tea?
</P>
<P>
   So just how many ginseng-infused, newfangled teas will the
market bear?
</P>
<P>
   Plenty, industry observers say. Just keep the flavors coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``As with any beverage, we have to fight flavor fatigue,'' says
SoBe's Bello.
</P>
<P>
   Bello, who was at one time vice president of marketing for
Arizona Beverages, says about 40 percent of his time at SoBe is
spent on formulation and flavors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important ingredient in any beverage product is great
taste,'' he says. ``You take your basic lemon tea and push it to
the next level of creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   The new breed of iced teas run the gamut, from straight-laced
tea flavors to ``barely sweetened'' to brands with plenty of
high-fructose corn syrup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the newer iced teas are differentiating themselves
with a flavor profile that is not as sweet and syrupy (as past
brews). They actually taste like real tea,'' says Fresh Cup's
Janssen.
</P>
<P>
   Honest Tea, for instance, touts its brew as ``barely
sweetened.'' Their tea contains 1 teaspoon sweetener _ typically
agave nectar, organic cane sugar or light clover honey _ vs. the
average 6 teaspoons of high-fructose corn syrup found in the
average can of soda.
</P>
<P>
   Subtle, complex flavors
</P>
<P>
   Avowed tea drinkers compare the subtle nuances of their favorite
brews to a glass of fine wine. A black tea, for instance, tastes
more assertive than an oolong, which differs from the slightly
bitter flavor of green tea.
</P>
<P>
   ``First we had red and white (wine). Then we had chardonnay and
merlot. Now this estate vs. that estate,'' Honest Tea's Goldman
says. ``With iced tea, there was Lipton. Then people started to
realize there were these great teas that each had their own flavor.
It's not just black tea anymore. It's green tea, herbal teas, chai,
and I personally have a lot of interest in decaffeinated black
tea.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Rubin, the Republic of Tea's ``Minister of Tea,'' also
compares tea with wine when talking about the company's line of
ready-to-drink teas, which are designed to complement food.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've tried to do is elevate tea and put it next to
bottled wine,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of going for mainstream distribution through
supermarkets and convenience stores, the premium teas are only
available on menus of high-end restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The line, which starting rolling out two years ago, is sold in a
16.9-ounce bottle, which contains two servings when poured over
ice. Rubin says the bottle opening is 28 millimeters, roughly the
size of a wine bottle, as opposed to a 38-millimeter, wide-mouth,
gulping size similar to an Arizona brand tea. The teas sell for
$2.95 to $3.95 a bottle and are available locally at Grand St.
Cafe, the Paradise Grill and Fedora's.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as a tidal wave of iced tea continues to roll across
a thirsty land, Honest Tea is staking out the moral high ground
with its First Nation Organic Herbal Tea.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a traditional Native American recipe, the tea is a
result of a partnership with the Crow Indians and features
peppermint from I'tchik Herbs, a woman-owned company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wonderful world of tea is changing,'' says the Tea
Council's Simrany.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Granny's thirsty for a brand-new brew.
</P>
<P>
   .MDNM/
</P>
<P>
   Cool Jet Tea is really hot
</P>
<P>
   Can you name the hottest iced tea drink of the summer of '99?
</P>
<P>
   Try Jet Tea, a smoothie blended from real fruit juice, green
tea, ginseng, ginkgo biloba, vitamin C and folic acid. Made in a
blender from concentrate, it comes in mango, peach, strawberry and
wild berry flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if you're a hard-core tea fan with rigid ideas of what
qualifies as iced tea, the name Jet Tea may seem misleading. ``It's
not apparent to me that there is even any tea in it,'' says David
Weeda, who sells Jet Tea at the Supreme Bean coffeehouse, 1615 W.
39th St. in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   But Danny O'Neill, owner of the Roasterie specialty coffee
wholesaler in Kansas City and a distributor of Jet Tea, says that,
while subtle, ``I have to think the tea plays a role in the flavor
profile. It gives it a distinct taste.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of true tea flavor certainly doesn't seem to bother
Weeda or his customers, who are clamoring for ``a really icy drink
that you pour straight out of the blender. It's good fodder for a
brain freeze!''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, thanks to the broiling heat wave that gripped the city
in recent weeks, local coffeehouses and cafes report Jet Tea sales
have been brisk. On one recent afternoon when the mercury hovered
in the triple digits, Noori's, a new cafe at 2020 Baltimore, sold
20 Jet Teas in just two hours, according to manager Connie Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Still, T Jensen, owner of Westwood Hills' Hi Hat Coffee at 5012
State Line Road, notes that even in chilly March when he opened
with Jet Tea on the menu, it became an immediate hot seller,
especially with high school students from nearby Pembroke Hill.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative to dairy-based smoothies, Jensen describes Jet
Tea as a ``quick, fast, 21st-century, good-for-you kinda drink'' in
the trendy, fast-moving beverage world.
</P>
<P>
   Although mango appears to be the most popular flavor, plenty of
folks are customizing their drinks by mixing two or more flavors. A
16-ounce serving contains 248 calories and 0 grams of fat. It also
supplies 100 percent of the daily recommended allowance of vitamin
C and folic acid. The caffeine is equivalent to decaffeinated tea
or coffee. Prices range from $2.65 to $3 for a 16-ounce serving.

</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw, among suggestions on ways commuters can help cut down
on smog, that one is to refuel vehicles after 6 p.m. Can you
explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: The reasoning behind the after-6 suggestion is that highest
ozone levels are recorded during daytime, when high-emission
activities are most likely to occur. By waiting until after 6,
volatile organic compound emissions, which are key ingredients in
ozone formation, would be released in non-peak hours and wouldn't
contribute to the ground-level ozone buildup during the day.
</P>
<P>
   A second factor is temperatures. ``Smog alert days'' are most
likely to be hot and sunny. Volatile organic compound emissions
released when it's cooler _ typically after 6 _ are less likely to
contribute to ground-level ozone.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When were the words ``under God'' added to the Pledge of
Allegiance?
</P>
<P>
   A: 1954. It was mandated by an act of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently responded to a question about the song
``Dixie.'' That prompts my question. What is the origin of the word
``Dixie''?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are various interpretations of the origin, but the one
several sources (Facts on File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrases
Origins, World Book Encyclopedia, and Morris Dictionary of Word and
Phrase Origins) agree on is that dixie comes from the name of $10
notes issued by a New Orleans bank before the Civil War. Since the
notes bore the French-Creole word dix (ten) on one side, Louisiana
became known as ``Dix's land,'' which was shortened to Dixie and
then came to mean the entire South.
</P>
<P>
   Less credible theories involve the 18th century Mason-Dixon Line
and a plantation owner, said to have been in New York, named Dixie
or Dixy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can a former wife draw on her ex-husband's Social Security
benefits?
</P>
<P>
   A: Patti Patterson of tje Social Security Administration
explains that an ex-wife is entitled to a divorced spouse's
benefits under certain specific conditions: if her ex-husband, the
worker, is entitled to a Social Security retirement or disability
benefit; if the wife is at least 62 years old; if the wife has not
remarried; and if the wife was married to the worker at least 10
years prior to the divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My husband and I sailed on the SS United States(in December
1965 and have fond memories. The ship has been drydocked for years,
but I've heard there may be some new developments. What is taking
place?
</P>
<P>
   A: Along with an avid band of preservationists, the ship's
owner, Edward Cantor, a commercial real estate developer in Neu
Jersey, is facing the daunting task of saving the vessel. It
currently lies dark and empty at a pier on the Delaware River in
Philadelphia. Among efforts under way to raise money for the ship's
preservation are the formation of the S.S. United States Foundation
and a Web site, www.SS-United-States.com Like so many
trans-Atlantic luxury liners, the United States fell victim to jet
planes after crossing the Atlantic more than 800 times between 1952
and 1969. Several attempts have been made over the years to
resurrect the ship into a commercial success, but all have failed.
Cantor bought it in 1997 for $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Fair, an engineer who supervises Cantor's interest in the
vessel, said several groups have presented different options for
it, including turning it into a hotel and convention center along
the lines of the Queen Mary in Long Beach, Calif. One supporter,
Frank Braynard, a maritime museum curator at the U.S. Merchant
Marine Academy, has suggested refurbishing the United States and
docking it next to the aircraft carrier Intrepid in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The expense involved is formidable. Cantor is said to be
spending $100,000 a month for wharfage, security, insurance and
upkeep. He is said to be looking for buyers willing to pay $30
million. In the meantime, an advertising agency is cooking up an ad
campaign to seek donations, and a TV documentary is in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We frequently read about people being awarded Carnegie
life-saving medals. What is involved, and how does one nominate a
person for such an honor?
</P>
<P>
   A: The medals are awarded by the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission,
a private foundation in Pittsburgh recognizing acts of
``extraordinary heroism'' in the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors are involved. Medals are for civilians who
voluntarily risk their own lives, knowingly, to an ``extraordinary
degree'' while saving, or attempting to save, the life of another
person. That act of heroism must have taken place in the United
States, Canada, or the waters within 12 nautical miles of the two
countries. And it must be brought to the attention of the
commission within two years of the date it occurred, with proof of
the conditions surrounding the act provided. A number of categories
of people are excluded from consideration for medals, by the way.
In addition to medals, winning candidates receive a $2,500 grand
and, occasionally, a pension or scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Nomination forms may be obtained from the Carnegie Hero Fund
Commission, Jeffrey A. Dooley, Investigations Manager, 425 Sixth
Ave., Suite 1640, Pittsburgh, PA 15219-1823. Or you can simply
write to that address with full details and supporting
documentation. Information is available online at
http://trfn.clpgh.org/carnegiehero/
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the origin of the word ``gasoline,'' as motorists in
this country call it? In many other countries, it's called
``petrol,'' whose origin obviously is from ``petroleum.''
</P>
<P>
   A: As explained in the Facts on File Encyclopedia of Word and
Phrase Origins, the word ``gasoline'' made its debut in the 19th
century when scientists coined it by combining ``gas,'' a word
first used nearly three centuries earlier, ``ol'' from the Latin
``oleum'' (``oil''), and -ine. The earlier word ``gas,'' by the
way, as used by its discoverer, Dutch physician and chemist Jean
Baptiste van Helmont, according to the encyclopedia, came from the
word ``chaos'' _ ``boundless empty space'' in Greek.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the status of the Dead Sea scrolls? Where are they
housed? And can you refresh my memory about when and where they
were found, and what they contain?
</P>
<P>
   A: Almost all the scrolls are in Jerusalem, according to the
Dead Sea Scrolls Foundation. Of the more than 800 scrolls, the most
famous were discovered in caves along the western shore of the Dead
Sea between 1947 and 1956, with later finds in the 1950s to
mid-1960s. Some were complete or nearly complete, but most were
fragmentary.
</P>
<P>
   The scrolls include fragments of every book of the Hebrew Bible,
which Christians call the Old Testament, except the Book of Esther.
They also include fragments of the Septuagint, the earliest Greek
text of the Hebrew Bible, and large parts of an Aramaic translation
of Job, as well as parts of books found only in Roman Catholic and
Eastern Orthodox Bibles. In addition to previously unknown texts,
scholars found that they contain prayers, hymns, commentaries on
parts of the Bible, legends, prophecies, religious arguments, and
otherwise unknown stories about characters in the Hebrew Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars are continuing to prepare the scrolls for publication
in what eventually will be a 35-volume set, but progress is
hampered by insufficient funding, according to the Dead Sea Scrolls
Foundation. Online information about the foundation can be found at
www.hum.huji.ac.il/staff/fdss.htm Q: A settlement in the Synthroid
class action suit was reported recently. For those of us involved
in it, what's the next step?
</P>
<P>
   A: The recent settlement was between Knoll Pharmaceutical Co.
and attorneys general of 37 states. It is separate from the class
action marketing litigation involving Synthroid, said Daryl
Robinson of the Georgia attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   The class action suit for consumers who used Synthroid, a
synthetic thyroid hormone drug, is ongoing. The plaintiffs'
attorneys' Synthroid marketing litigation telephone support line
_1-800-853-4853 _ provides updated information about that case.
There's no settlement at this time, and no trial date has been set.
The recording also includes information for those who have filed
claims, but says no further information on the status of the
litigation is available, and no additional claim forms will be sent
out. The statement is available online at www.synthroidclaims.com/
</P>
<P>
   The class action suit, by the way, is concerned with marketing
issues, not Synthroid's safety or effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In baseball, what does a backward K mean? I know a K means
strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   A: The backward K is a standard scoring symbol for a strikeout
on a called strike. A called strike, of course, is a pitch not
swung at but judged by the umpire as being in the strike zone.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Does a first lady have any benefits or pension rights upon
the death of her husband?
</P>
<P>
   A: A presidential pension does not have survivor rights, said
Pete Sepp of the National Taxpayers Union. The only thing provided
to first ladies, as well as to widows of active duty members of
Congress, is something called a ``widow's gratuity'' amounting to
about $25,000. That sum is customarily voted by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Former first ladies also are granted Secret Service protection,
whether their husbands are living or deceased. And first ladies who
may be widows of former presidents who also had been members of
Congress or governors may have survivor annuity rights to part of
that pension, Sepp said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the status of Olean cooking oil? We were told a year
ago that it was coming soon to supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   A: It was never the intent of Procter &AMP; Gamble to make Olean
available in supermarkets as a cooking oil for individual
homemakers and consumers, said P&AMP;G spokeswoman Sydney McHugh. Olean
is intended for manufacturers to use in the production of salted
snacks without the added fat and calories of regular snacks, she
added.
</P>
<P>
   Although the oil itself isn't available to consumers, several
products manufactured with it are, McHugh said. They include
Procter &AMP; Gamble's fat-free Pringle's and Frito-Lay's Wow! line of
snacks, both available nationwide, and Herr's Rave potato chips and
Utz's Yes! line of chips, available regionally.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I thought I read that John F. Kennedy Sr.'s coffin was buried
at sea. Am I correct? Please clarify.
</P>
<P>
   A: President Kennedy is buried at Arlington National Cemetery in
a mahogany coffin obtained in Washington. The coffin you read about
is a bronze one in which his body was transported to Washington
from Dallas after his assassination on Nov. 22, 1963. The first
coffin, purchased from Dallas undertaker Vernon Oneal, was replaced
because it was damaged, according to published reports.
</P>
<P>
   Documents released in June by the National Archives show that
the first coffin was still in the National Archives' main building
in Washington in February 1966 when Sen. Robert F. Kennedy (D-N.Y.)
called the General Services Administration, which oversees
government property, and asked for it to be released to the
military for destruction. ``I think it belongs to the family, and
we can get rid of it any way we want to,'' Kennedy told GSA
Administrator Lawson Knott.
</P>
<P>
   According to the recently released documents, on Feb. 18, 1966,
an Air Force van picked up the casket and transported it to Andrews
Air Force Base, Md., where it was loaded onto a C-130. The plane
took off at 8:38 a.m. and flew about 131 nautical miles off the
Maryland-Delaware coast, where it was dropped in 9,000 feet of
water. The drop point was chosen because it was away from air and
shipping lanes and in an explosives dumping area.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about the 50 state quarters mentioned that a
Mint-sewn bag of 100 coins is available for $29.95. I can't find
anything about it on the Mint's Web site. Do you have any
information?
</P>
<P>
   A: The U.S. Mint originally sold bags of Delaware, Pennsylvania
and New Jersey quarters, a spokeswoman said. The Delaware and
Pennsylvania bags have sold out, she told Q&AMP;A, but the New Jersey
quarters are still available in bags of 100 for $29.95 or 1,000 for
$289.95. There's no shipping and handling for online orders; for
telephone, fax or mail orders, the fee is $3.95.
</P>
<P>
   The information is available on the Mint's Web site _
www1.usmint.gov/50states/default.htm _ if you do some digging.
Click first on The Online Catalog, then on 50 State Quarters, then
on 50 State Quarters Bags.

</P>
<P>
   Q: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution recently reported on a
clinic in New Orleans that treats jazz musicians. It's struggling
to stay alive with donations. Where can we send money?
</P>
<P>
   A: Checks should be made out to the LSU Medical Center
Foundation and mailed to: New Orleans Musicians' Clinic, c/o LSU
Medical Center Foundation, 1600 Canal St., Suite 1010, New Orleans,
LA 70112.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several articles about the deaths of John F. Kennedy Jr.,
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and her sister, Lauren, have mentioned
that Lauren had a twin sister, Lisa Anne. But nothing has been
mentioned about Lisa Anne, other than her name. Do you know
anything about her?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not a lot of information is available. Lisa Bessette
graduated from Greenwich (Conn.) High School and the University of
Michigan. She is an art historian, and was last reported to be
working toward her doctorate in Renaissance studies in Munich,
Germany. With her mother, Anne Freeman, and her stepfather, Dr.
Richard Freeman, she attended a private candlelight service for
Carolyn on July 24 in Greenwich, Conn.,
</P>
<P>
   Lisa and Lauren were about a year older than Carolyn. As a San
Francisco Chronicle columnist wrote last month, the three sisters
grew up ``confident and accomplished in the leafy, affluent town of
Greenwich.'' In 1996, the Boston Herald's Inside Track column
reported that Lisa and her husband, Michael Roman, were among a
number of people reading Scripture passages at the wedding of
Carolyn and JFK Jr. on Georgia's Cumberland Island.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, while the publicity spotlight fell squarely on
sister Carolyn, especially after her marriage, Lisa seems to have
stayed out of the news.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the national debt? A letter to the editor said it is
up to $7 trillion, but I understood that it was more like $5
trillion.
</P>
<P>
   A: As of noon on Aug. 4, the public debt was $5.6 trillion _ or,
to the penny, $5,642,376,785,503.90. The Treasury Department's
Bureau of the Public Debt posts the numbers online at this address
_ www.publicdebt.treas.gov/opd/opdpenny.htm _ and a ``debt clock''
can be accessed online at www.brillig.com/debtclock/ Q: What was
the cost of the search for John F. Kennedy Jr.'s airplane?
</P>
<P>
   A: Several agencies were involved, using patrol boats,
helicopters and other aircraft. Only Coast Guard and National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration costs have been released.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard's total cost was about $492,000, but the only
extra cost for the Kennedy mission would have been for fuel, said
spokesman Jack O'Dell. The NOAA spent about $25,000 above the
$30,000 it normally would have spent operating the Rude And
Whiting.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of the cost sparked this angry retort from Coast Guard
spokesman Mike Lapinski: ``During the same time as the Kennedy
search, we had two other search-and-rescues that actually took more
resources.'' He didn't list their costs, but said they involved an
unsuccessful search for a man who fell off his boat off the coast
of Puerto Rico, and the rescue of three fishermen off the coast of
Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said President
Clinton ``made it clear that we should have done what we did _ go
the extra mile for a family who has suffered so much and
contributed so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are James Arness, Raymond Burr and Peter Graves brothers? I
remember reading something several years ago, when their father
died, that it was like being at a funeral for giants.
</P>
<P>
   A: Two actors out of three indeed are brothers, but the third
you named isn't related to the others in any way.
</P>
<P>
   James Arness (born on May 26, 1923, in Minneapolis) and Peter
Graves (born on March 18, 1926, also in Minneapolis) are the
brothers. Their parents, who divorced in 1948, were Rolf C. and
Ruth Duesler Aurness. Rolf Aurness was a medical supply salesman.
James Arness dropped the ``u'' from his last name, and Peter
changed his last name completely.
</P>
<P>
   Burr (born May 21, 1917, in New Westminster, British Columbia)
was the oldest of three children born to William Burr, a hardware
dealer, and Minerva Smith Burr, a concert pianist. His parents
separated when Raymond was 6. Burr, best known as TV's ``Perry
Mason,'' died in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several months back, I read about a way to donate my
accumulated Delta SkyMiles for the benefit of others. Do you have
that information?
</P>
<P>
   A: Delta's program is called SkyWish. Donations can be made in
5,000-mile increments with a 5,000-mile minimum, said Delta
spokesman John Kennedy. The airline will add 1,000 miles for every
5,000 miles donated by a SkyMiles (frequent-flier program) member.
Donations, which are not tax-deductible, can be made to CARE,
Make-a-Wish Foundation, Make-a-Wish International, United Way of
America and United Way International. Information: 1-800-323-2323.
</P>
<P>
   Q: As a Navy veteran of World War II, I'm entertaining the
notion of burial at sea. Where can I get information?
</P>
<P>
   A: Those who are eligible for Navy burial at sea are active duty
personnel, and retired, honorably discharged veterans and their
family members; U.S. civilian marine personnel of the Military
Sealift Command; and other U.S. citizens who are determined
eligible by the chief of naval operations because of notable
service and/or other contributions to our government.
</P>
<P>
   For information, write to the Casualty Assistance Branch,
NPC-621, Department of the Navy, Washington DC 20370; or, to
request an information packet, call Navy Mortuary Headquarters,
1-800-876-1131, extension 629.

<P>
   A: Patti Patterson of the Social Security Administration
explains that an ex-wife is entitled to a divorced spouse's
benefits under certain specific conditions: if her ex-husband, the
worker, is entitled to a Social Security retirement or disability
benefit; if the wife is at least 62 years old; if the wife has not
remarried; and if the wife was married to the worker at least 10
years prior to the divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My husband and I sailed on the SS United States in December
1965 and have fond memories. The ship has been drydocked for years,
but I've heard there may be some new developments. What is taking
place?
</P>
<P>
   A: Along with an avid band of preservationists, the ship's
owner, Edward Cantor, a commercial real estate developer in New
Jersey, is facing the daunting task of saving the vessel. It
currently lies dark and empty at a pier on the Delaware River in
Philadelphia. Among efforts under way to raise money for the ship's
preservation are the formation of the S.S. United States Foundation
and a Web site, www.SS-United-States.com Like so many
trans-Atlantic luxury liners, the United States fell victim to jet
planes after crossing the Atlantic more than 800 times between 1952
and 1969. Several attempts have been made over the years to
resurrect the ship into a commercial success, but all have failed.
Cantor bought it in 1997 for $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Fair, an engineer who supervises Cantor's interest in the
vessel, said several groups have presented different options for
it, including turning it into a hotel and convention center along
the lines of the Queen Mary in Long Beach, Calif. One supporter,
Frank Braynard, a maritime museum curator at the U.S. Merchant
Marine Academy, has suggested refurbishing the United States and
docking it next to the aircraft carrier Intrepid in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The expense involved is formidable. Cantor is said to be
spending $100,000 a month for wharfage, security, insurance and
upkeep. He is said to be looking for buyers willing to pay $30
million. In the meantime, an advertising agency is cooking up an ad
campaign to seek donations, and a TV documentary is in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We frequently read about people being awarded Carnegie
life-saving medals. What is involved, and how does one nominate a
person for such an honor?
</P>
<P>
   A: The medals are awarded by the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission,
a private foundation in Pittsburgh recognizing acts of
``extraordinary heroism'' in the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors are involved. Medals are for civilians who
voluntarily risk their own lives, knowingly, to an ``extraordinary
degree'' while saving, or attempting to save, the life of another
person. That act of heroism must have taken place in the United
States, Canada, or the waters within 12 nautical miles of the two
countries. And it must be brought to the attention of the
commission within two years of the date it occurred, with proof of
the conditions surrounding the act provided. A number of categories
of people are excluded from consideration for medals, by the way.
In addition to medals, winning candidates receive a $2,500 grand
and, occasionally, a pension or scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Nomination forms may be obtained from the Carnegie Hero Fund
Commission, Jeffrey A. Dooley, Investigations Manager, 425 Sixth
Ave., Suite 1640, Pittsburgh, PA 15219-1823. Or you can simply
write to that address with full details and supporting
documentation. Information is available online at
http://trfn.clpgh.org/carnegiehero/
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the origin of the word ``gasoline,'' as motorists in
this country call it? In many other countries, it's called
``petrol,'' whose origin obviously is from ``petroleum.''
</P>
<P>
   A: As explained in the Facts on File Encyclopedia of Word and
Phrase Origins, the word ``gasoline'' made its debut in the 19th
century when scientists coined it by combining ``gas,'' a word
first used nearly three centuries earlier, ``ol'' from the Latin
``oleum'' (``oil''), and -ine. The earlier word ``gas,'' by the
way, as used by its discoverer, Dutch physician and chemist Jean
Baptiste van Helmont, according to the encyclopedia, came from the
word ``chaos'' _ ``boundless empty space'' in Greek.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the status of the Dead Sea scrolls? Where are they
housed? And can you refresh my memory about when and where they
were found, and what they contain?
</P>
<P>
   A: Almost all the scrolls are in Jerusalem, according to the
Dead Sea Scrolls Foundation. Of the more than 800 scrolls, the most
famous were discovered in caves along the western shore of the Dead
Sea between 1947 and 1956, with later finds in the 1950s to
mid-1960s. Some were complete or nearly complete, but most were
fragmentary.
</P>
<P>
   The scrolls include fragments of every book of the Hebrew Bible,
which Christians call the Old Testament, except the Book of Esther.
They also include fragments of the Septuagint, the earliest Greek
text of the Hebrew Bible, and large parts of an Aramaic translation
of Job, as well as parts of books found only in Roman Catholic and
Eastern Orthodox Bibles. In addition to previously unknown texts,
scholars found that they contain prayers, hymns, commentaries on
parts of the Bible, legends, prophecies, religious arguments, and
otherwise unknown stories about characters in the Hebrew Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars are continuing to prepare the scrolls for publication
in what eventually will be a 35-volume set, but progress is
hampered by insufficient funding, according to the Dead Sea Scrolls
Foundation. Online information about the foundation can be found at
www.hum.huji.ac.il/staff/fdss.htm Q: A settlement in the Synthroid
class action suit was reported recently. For those of us involved
in it, what's the next step?
</P>
<P>
   A: The recent settlement was between Knoll Pharmaceutical Co.
and attorneys general of 37 states. It is separate from the class
action marketing litigation involving Synthroid, said Daryl
Robinson of the Georgia attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   The class action suit for consumers who used Synthroid, a
synthetic thyroid hormone drug, is ongoing. The plaintiffs'
attorneys' Synthroid marketing litigation telephone support line
_1-800-853-4853 _ provides updated information about that case.
There's no settlement at this time, and no trial date has been set.
The recording also includes information for those who have filed
claims, but says no further information on the status of the
litigation is available, and no additional claim forms will be sent
out. The statement is available online at www.synthroidclaims.com/
</P>
<P>
   The class action suit, by the way, is concerned with marketing
issues, not Synthroid's safety or effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In baseball, what does a backward K mean? I know a K means
strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   A: The backward K is a standard scoring symbol for a strikeout
on a called strike. A called strike, of course, is a pitch not
swung at but judged by the umpire as being in the strike zone.

 &HT;    (EDS: Take two of 2 takes.)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Does a first lady have any benefits or pension rights upon
the death of her husband?
</P>
<P>
   A: A presidential pension does not have survivor rights, said
Pete Sepp of the National Taxpayers Union. The only thing provided
to first ladies, as well as to widows of active duty members of
Congress, is something called a ``widow's gratuity'' amounting to
about $25,000. That sum is customarily voted by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Former first ladies also are granted Secret Service protection,
whether their husbands are living or deceased. And first ladies who
may be widows of former presidents who also had been members of
Congress or governors may have survivor annuity rights to part of
that pension, Sepp said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the status of Olean cooking oil? We were told a year
ago that it was coming soon to supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   A: It was never the intent of Procter &AMP; Gamble to make Olean
available in supermarkets as a cooking oil for individual
homemakers and consumers, said P&AMP;G spokeswoman Sydney McHugh. Olean
is intended for manufacturers to use in the production of salted
snacks without the added fat and calories of regular snacks, she
added.
</P>
<P>
   Although the oil itself isn't available to consumers, several
products manufactured with it are, McHugh said. They include
Procter &AMP; Gamble's fat-free Pringle's and Frito-Lay's Wow! line of
snacks, both available nationwide, and Herr's Rave potato chips and
Utz's Yes! line of chips, available regionally.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I thought I read that John F. Kennedy Sr.'s coffin was buried
at sea. Am I correct? Please clarify.
</P>
<P>
   A: President Kennedy is buried at Arlington National Cemetery in
a mahogany coffin obtained in Washington. The coffin you read about
is a bronze one in which his body was transported to Washington
from Dallas after his assassination on Nov. 22, 1963. The first
coffin, purchased from Dallas undertaker Vernon Oneal, was replaced
because it was damaged, according to published reports.
</P>
<P>
   Documents released in June by the National Archives show that
the first coffin was still in the National Archives' main building
in Washington in February 1966 when Sen. Robert F. Kennedy (D-N.Y.)
called the General Services Administration, which oversees
government property, and asked for it to be released to the
military for destruction. ``I think it belongs to the family, and
we can get rid of it any way we want to,'' Kennedy told GSA
Administrator Lawson Knott.
</P>
<P>
   According to the recently released documents, on Feb. 18, 1966,
an Air Force van picked up the casket and transported it to Andrews
Air Force Base, Md., where it was loaded onto a C-130. The plane
took off at 8:38 a.m. and flew about 131 nautical miles off the
Maryland-Delaware coast, where it was dropped in 9,000 feet of
water. The drop point was chosen because it was away from air and
shipping lanes and in an explosives dumping area.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about the 50 state quarters mentioned that a
Mint-sewn bag of 100 coins is available for $29.95. I can't find
anything about it on the Mint's Web site. Do you have any
information?
</P>
<P>
   A: The U.S. Mint originally sold bags of Delaware, Pennsylvania
and New Jersey quarters, a spokeswoman said. The Delaware and
Pennsylvania bags have sold out, she told Q&AMP;A, but the New Jersey
quarters are still available in bags of 100 for $29.95 or 1,000 for
$289.95. There's no shipping and handling for online orders; for
telephone, fax or mail orders, the fee is $3.95.
</P>
<P>
   The information is available on the Mint's Web site _
www1.usmint.gov/50states/default.htm _ if you do some digging.
Click first on The Online Catalog, then on 50 State Quarters, then
on 50 State Quarters Bags.

<P>
   Q: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution recently reported on a
clinic in New Orleans that treats jazz musicians. It's struggling
to stay alive with donations. Where can we send money?
</P>
<P>
   A: Checks should be made out to the LSU Medical Center
Foundation and mailed to: New Orleans Musicians' Clinic, c/o LSU
Medical Center Foundation, 1600 Canal St., Suite 1010, New Orleans,
LA 70112.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several articles about the deaths of John F. Kennedy Jr.,
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and her sister, Lauren, have mentioned
that Lauren had a twin sister, Lisa Anne. But nothing has been
mentioned about Lisa Anne, other than her name. Do you know
anything about her?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not a lot of information is available. Lisa Bessette
graduated from Greenwich (Conn.) High School and the University of
Michigan. She is an art historian, and was last reported to be
working toward her doctorate in Renaissance studies in Munich,
Germany. With her mother, Anne Freeman, and her stepfather, Dr.
Richard Freeman, she attended a private candlelight service for
Carolyn on July 24 in Greenwich, Conn.,
</P>
<P>
   Lisa and Lauren were about a year older than Carolyn. As a San
Francisco Chronicle columnist wrote last month, the three sisters
grew up ``confident and accomplished in the leafy, affluent town of
Greenwich.'' In 1996, the Boston Herald's Inside Track column
reported that Lisa and her husband, Michael Roman, were among a
number of people reading Scripture passages at the wedding of
Carolyn and JFK Jr. on Georgia's Cumberland Island.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, while the publicity spotlight fell squarely on
sister Carolyn, especially after her marriage, Lisa seems to have
stayed out of the news.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the national debt? A letter to the editor said it is
up to $7 trillion, but I understood that it was more like $5
trillion.
</P>
<P>
   A: As of noon on Aug. 4, the public debt was $5.6 trillion _ or,
to the penny, $5,642,376,785,503.90. The Treasury Department's
Bureau of the Public Debt posts the numbers online at this address
_ www.publicdebt.treas.gov/opd/opdpenny.htm _ and a ``debt clock''
can be accessed online at www.brillig.com/debtclock/ Q: What was
the cost of the search for John F. Kennedy Jr.'s airplane?
</P>
<P>
   A: Several agencies were involved, using patrol boats,
helicopters and other aircraft. Only Coast Guard and National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration costs have been released.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard's total cost was about $492,000, but the only
extra cost for the Kennedy mission would have been for fuel, said
spokesman Jack O'Dell. The NOAA spent about $25,000 above the
$30,000 it normally would have spent operating the Rude And
Whiting.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of the cost sparked this angry retort from Coast Guard
spokesman Mike Lapinski: ``During the same time as the Kennedy
search, we had two other search-and-rescues that actually took more
resources.'' He didn't list their costs, but said they involved an
unsuccessful search for a man who fell off his boat off the coast
of Puerto Rico, and the rescue of three fishermen off the coast of
Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said President
Clinton ``made it clear that we should have done what we did _ go
the extra mile for a family who has suffered so much and
contributed so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are James Arness, Raymond Burr and Peter Graves brothers? I
remember reading something several years ago, when their father
died, that it was like being at a funeral for giants.
</P>
<P>
   A: Two actors out of three indeed are brothers, but the third
you named isn't related to the others in any way.
</P>
<P>
   James Arness (born on May 26, 1923, in Minneapolis) and Peter
Graves (born on March 18, 1926, also in Minneapolis) are the
brothers. Their parents, who divorced in 1948, were Rolf C. and
Ruth Duesler Aurness. Rolf Aurness was a medical supply salesman.
James Arness dropped the ``u'' from his last name, and Peter
changed his last name completely.
</P>
<P>
   Burr (born May 21, 1917, in New Westminster, British Columbia)
was the oldest of three children born to William Burr, a hardware
dealer, and Minerva Smith Burr, a concert pianist. His parents
separated when Raymond was 6. Burr, best known as TV's ``Perry
Mason,'' died in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several months back, I read about a way to donate my
accumulated Delta SkyMiles for the benefit of others. Do you have
that information?
</P>
<P>
   A: Delta's program is called SkyWish. Donations can be made in
5,000-mile increments with a 5,000-mile minimum, said Delta
spokesman John Kennedy. The airline will add 1,000 miles for every
5,000 miles donated by a SkyMiles (frequent-flier program) member.
Donations, which are not tax-deductible, can be made to CARE,
Make-a-Wish Foundation, Make-a-Wish International, United Way of
America and United Way International. Information: 1-800-323-2323.
</P>
<P>
   Q: As a Navy veteran of World War II, I'm entertaining the
notion of burial at sea. Where can I get information?
</P>
<P>
   A: Those who are eligible for Navy burial at sea are active duty
personnel, and retired, honorably discharged veterans and their
family members; U.S. civilian marine personnel of the Military
Sealift Command; and other U.S. citizens who are determined
eligible by the chief of naval operations because of notable
service and/or other contributions to our government.
</P>
<P>
   For information, write to the Casualty Assistance Branch,
NPC-621, Department of the Navy, Washington DC 20370; or, to
request an information packet, call Navy Mortuary Headquarters,
1-800-876-1131, extension 629.

   SHORT-LIST (BRITE) _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Labor Day won't
laze around for almost four weeks, and the autumnal equinox is
still more than a month away. But for students and teachers, summer
is setting, and it must seem particularly fleeting. Long story
short: Students will return to their desks soon. As summer wanes
for schoolkids, they might do well to remember the words of the
Spanish writer who said, ``Good things, when short, are twice as
good.'' Let this short supply of facts serve as inspiration. Study

   SHORT-LIST (BRITE) _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Labor Day won't
laze around for almost four weeks, and the autumnal equinox is
still more than a month away. But for students and teachers, summer
is setting, and it must seem particularly fleeting. Long story
short: Students will return to their desks soon. As summer wanes
for schoolkids, they might do well to remember the words of the
Spanish writer who said, ``Good things, when short, are twice as
good.'' Let this short supply of facts serve as inspiration. Study
hard _ you never know when you'll be quizzed on short notice.

 &HT;    Summer's on the short list
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Labor Day won't laze around for almost
four weeks, and the autumnal equinox is still more than a month
away. But for students and teachers, summer is setting, and it must
seem particularly fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   Long story short: Students packed their book bags for summer
vacation June 8, and they'll return to their desks soon.
</P>
<P>
   As summer wanes for schoolkids, they might do well to remember
the words of the Spanish writer who said, ``Good things, when
short, are twice as good.''
</P>
<P>
   Let this short supply of facts serve as inspiration. Study hard
_ you never know when you'll be quizzed on short notice.
</P>
<P>
   Short star turn
</P>
<P>
   Dame Judi Dench's Oscar-winning work as Queen Elizabeth I in
``Shakespeare in Love'' is over in 500 seconds. Upon receiving her
gold statuette earlier this year, she quipped: ``I feel for eight
minutes on the screen I should only get a little bit of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Short exchange
</P>
<P>
   Victor Hugo's telegram asking his publishers how ``Les
Miserables'' was selling:
</P>
<P>
   ``?''
</P>
<P>
   The reply:
</P>
<P>
   ``!''
</P>
<P>
   Short star
</P>
<P>
   The most diminutive star of a summer movie is Verne Troyer, the
``Austin Powers'' actor who measures 32 inches. In comparison,
R2-D2 towers over Troyer's Mini-Me. Kenny Baker, who has played the
droid from ``Star Wars'' through ``Phantom Menace,'' stands
</P>
<P>
   44 inches tall.
</P>
<P>
   Short of breath
</P>
<P>
   Irish playwright Samuel Beckett's ``Breath'' is over in three
deep breaths. Penned in 1969, the play lasts 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Famous Shorts
</P>
<P>
   Martin Short, ``Saturday Night Live'' alum; Bobby Short,
pianist;Frank Shorter, former University of Florida runner and
Olympic medalist in the marathon
</P>
<P>
   Short timer
</P>
<P>
   President William Henry Harrison enjoyed his White House digs
for a mere 30 days. His Inaugural Day cold swelled into pneumonia
when Harrison ventured out one brisk March morning to buy
vegetables. He died April 4, 1841, at the age of 68.
</P>
<P>
   Short leading men
</P>
<P>
   The average height of an adult male is 5 feet 9 inches, or the
size of movie titan Tom Cruise. Other celebs in their stocking
feet: Danny DeVito, 5 feet; Spike Lee, 5 feet 5 inches; Al Pacino,
5 feet 6 inches; and Martin Sheen, 5 feet 7 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Short short story
</P>
<P>
   In the 50-story collection ``The Best American Short Stories of
the Century'' released last spring, ``A City of Churches'' makes
shortest work of the short story genre. Author Donald Barthelme
brings his unsettling 1973 tale to its denouement in four pages.
</P>
<P>
   Short siblings
</P>
<P>
   The smallest living twins are John and Greg Rice _ motivational
speakers, real estate magnates and ``Maury Povich'' guests.
Guinness records each brother's height as 2 feet 10 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Short life span
</P>
<P>
   Giant tortoises have been known to live more than 150 years, and
African elephants can live for six decades. For the mayfly,
however, life truly is short. In its adult stage, the mayfly's life
span is a single day.
</P>
<P>
   Short TV show
</P>
<P>
   ``Turn On,'' an ABC comedy starring Tim Conway, was canceled
after a single half-hour episode on Feb. 5, 1969. Except in
Cleveland, where the station manager turned off ``Turn On'' after
15 minutes.

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: An image for our times
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Television digs emotion. So the enduring image of the shootings
at a suburban Los Angeles Jewish center will be that of little kids
holding hands, fleeing the gunman who wanted to shoot them down
like dogs. It is an image for our strange, dislocated times. A
morbid, self-perpetuating ritual has been devised for such
occasions:
</P>
<P>
   Anguished witnesses. Anguished relatives. Eloquent and
inarticulate grief. Memorial services. Prayers for the dead and
dying. Calls for tougher gun laws. Statements that guns don't kill
people. Demands for more guns so we can defend ourselves. Calls for
the enforcement of laws already on the books. Wistful speculation
that the National Rifle Association is through. Legislation
proposed. Legislation defeated. NRA triumphant. Another shooting.
Repeat the above.
</P>
<P>
   Little kids walking hand in hand, scarcely understanding that
they are the hunted. Maybe if the 68-year-old receptionist at the
center had been trained and armed, she could have rolled to the
floor and cut this jerk down before he opened up. To think that we
saw it on Mulberry Street.

WATCHING THE PENNIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   From: Hiawatha &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To: Accounting &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Subject: Expense Account Rejected?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, come on! $420 is nothing to you. Besides, it's been well
over a year since I last freshened up my home computer, and last
time I paid for it myself. Since then, a whole new generation of
hot hardware has come to market. It's your turn.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, I got your money's worth _ a nice, hot processor chip,
a new motherboard to run it, and one of the best 3D graphics
accelerator cards on the market. And since I slapped it all
together myself, and recycled a lot of old gear, think of how much
I saved the Globe on parts and labor. It would have cost you
hundreds more to buy me a box like the one that now sits humming
under my desk at home.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the processor. Just like last year, it boiled down to
a stark choice. Either I could go with another K6 processor from
Advanced Micro Devices Inc., or fall back on old reliable Intel
Corp. and shell out for a Pentium II. Or Pentium III. Or even a
cut-rate Celeron. First-generation Celerons were real mutts; the
current breed are greyhounds, not much slower than the PII chips.
</P>
<P>
   Rival AMD has spent the past year tripping over its own silicon,
losing money even as it gained market share. Its big problem _ an
inability to make enough of its best chips. And while AMD's elite
chips are cheaper than Intel's, and nearly as fast, they're still
not quite as good.
</P>
<P>
   AMD's big falldown is its ``floating-point'' performance.
Floating-point math is the kind kids hate, in which all the numbers
have decimal points. But it's the kind of math that's vital in
computer graphics, and AMD chips have always tended to be second
best in that department.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in my determination to save money for the Globe, I went
with AMD. I picked the K6-3 chip with a speed of 400 MHz for $180 _
quite enough power for journalism, right?
</P>
<P>
   Next, a new motherboard. You asked why I didn't save money by
just putting the new processor in the old board? Not that simple.
My previous chip, an older AMD K6, was designed for an older
motherboard with a speed of 66 MHz. Today's new AMD and Intel
processors need a faster connection to the computer's memory to
deliver top performance. The K6-3 will work only with a 100-MHz
motherboard, so of course I had to buy one for $100. Just be
thankful that I paid extra last year for PC-100 memory chips, which
I can reuse because they're compatible with the faster motherboard.
See? I'm still saving you money.
</P>
<P>
   As for your ``what's a Voodoo 3?'' question _ don't you read the
Globe? I just wrote about graphic accelerator cards a few weeks
ago, and the Voodoo 3 2000 from 3Dfx Corp. is one of the best. It's
got a superfast chip devoted to drawing pretty pictures on the
monitor, served by its own private 16-megabyte memory bank and
connected to the motherboard through an Accelerated Graphics Port
custom-designed for superior video performance. It's just the thing
when you're doing lots of . . .
</P>
<P>
   News articles? E-mails? Well, to tell the truth, the Voodoo is
no better for that kind of work than my old Diamond Multimedia
card. Any decent video card can handle such two-dimensional
software. I must admit the Voodoo 3 is there for just one reason _
3-D games. With a Voodoo under the hood, my home box now renders
the latest software shoot'em-ups with extraordinary clarity.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the Globe hired me to play word games, not
Mechwarrior 3. So let's compromise. I'll pick up the $130 Voodoo
tab; you cover the rest. That knocks your end down to $290. I'm
still looking out for you.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I saved you hundreds of dollars by keeping my old
hard drives, instead of plumping for one of those hot Ultra DMA/66
drives that move data twice as fast. That would have run around
$250 for the drive and a special controller card. I also kept my
archaic sound card instead of grabbing one of the new ones with 3-D
sound _ another $100 saved. I didn't even get that CD-ROM recorder
I've had my eye on, even though good ones can now be had for around
$200. And why? Because I worry about you. Besides, I'm sure they'll
be making even nicer ones the next time I upgrade.

   LAST WEEK'S TRANSMISSION:
</P>
<P>
   LATINO AMERICA: NEWSWEEK VS. GEORGE MAGAZINE. Is it the ``La
Bamba'' syndrome, or have Latinos in the United States really come
of age? Newsweek and George magazines recently tried to answer that
question, though with varying degrees of success. James Garcia,
editor and publisher of Politico, a national weekly newsletter on
U.S. Latino politics, reports that Newsweek did a generally
admirable job of laying out the trends in U.S. Latino culture,
while George magazine's cool and cutesy approach left a lot to be
desired. A report on what the coverage of these magazines says
about how the news media views U.S. Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   BAD THINGS DON'T JUST HAPPEN IN THE INNER CITIES. In the months
since the shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.,
there have been Senate hearings on the impact of violence on
children and a White House summit on youth violence. But what about
Angelique Dunn of Washington, D.C., and her 9-year-old son who was
shot while riding his bike outside his home? Who is looking out for
the Dunn family who lives in the inner city? In this commentary
from Emerge magazine, Kevin Merida reports on horrific acts of
violence committed by kids, and against kids, and its effects on
the nation. ``(In this country), a catharsis seems only to occur
when the victims of the crimes are white and the killers are white
and the community affected is white,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   THE EROSION OF CIVIL RIGHTS FOR ASIAN-AMERICAN IMMIGRANTS. In
1988, Xuan Wilson forged a check for $19.83 at a grocery store. She
served her time and has since gotten her life back together. _ Yet
Wilson _ who is a legal permanent resident of the United States _
may be deported because of recent immigration laws passed by
Congress. If deported, she will have to leave behind her husband,
her parents and three small children _ all of whom are U.S.
citizens. In this commentary from A. magazine, Joann H. Lee, an
attorney with the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium
in Washington, D.C., reports on how the Anti-Terrorism and
Effective Death Penalty Act and the Illegal Immigration Reform and
Immigrant Responsibility Act punish this country's legal immigrants
with a vengeance that far exceeds the seriousness of their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGIOUS LIBERTY SHOULD NOT VIOLATE CIVIL RIGHTS FOR GAYS. The
Religious Liberty Protection Act (RLPA), which recently went
through the House of Representatives, would prevent state and local
governments from ``substantially burden(ing) a person's religious
exercise'' unless there is a demonstrably ``compelling'' reason to
do so. But in its current form the bill poses a very real threat to
gay civil rights because it lacks a civil-rights exemption that
prohibits the exercise of religious liberty as a justification for
denying employment and housing opportunities to gay men and
lesbians. ``What religious liberty rights would be lost or weakened
by the inclusion of a civil-rights provision?'' asks columnist
Chuck Colbert. In this commentary, Colbert argues that the Senate
should reject the RLPA unless lawmakers safeguard the civil rights
of gays. Colbert serves on the board of directors of the National
Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association.
</P>
<P>
   KILLING THE U.S.A. BY COUNTING PEOPLE. There is another attack
on illegal aliens from the far-right flank, writes columnist Raoul
Lowery Contreras. Charles Wood, a former Justice Department Policy
Analyst, has written an article for the Harvard Journal of Law and
Policy that, according to Contreras, stretches credulity on the
question of whether or not illegal aliens should be counted in the
coming 2000 Census or in subsequent censuses. In this commentary,
Contreras debunks Woods arguments.

   KILLING THE U.S.A. BY COUNTING PEOPLE. There is another attack
on illegal aliens from the far-right flank, writes columnist Raoul
Lowery Contreras. Charles Wood, a former Justice Department Policy
Analyst, has written an article for the Harvard Journal of Law and
Policy that, according to Contreras, stretches credulity on the
question of whether or not illegal aliens should be counted in the
coming 2000 Census or in subsequent censuses. In this commentary,
Contreras debunks Woods arguments.

   LAST WEEK'S TRANSMISSION:
</P>
<P>
   LATINO AMERICA: NEWSWEEK VS. GEORGE MAGAZINE. Is it the ``La
Bamba'' syndrome, or have Latinos in the United States really come
of age? Newsweek and George magazines recently tried to answer that
question, though with varying degrees of success. James Garcia,
editor and publisher of Politico, a national weekly newsletter on
U.S. Latino politics, reports that Newsweek did a generally
admirable job of laying out the trends in U.S. Latino culture,
while George magazine's cool and cutesy approach left a lot to be
desired. A report on what the coverage of these magazines says
about how the news media views U.S. Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   BAD THINGS DON'T JUST HAPPEN IN THE INNER CITIES. In the months
since the shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.,
there have been Senate hearings on the impact of violence on
children and a White House summit on youth violence. But what about
Angelique Dunn of Washington, D.C., and her 9-year-old son who was
shot while riding his bike outside his home? Who is looking out for
the Dunn family who lives in the inner city? In this commentary
from Emerge magazine, Kevin Merida reports on horrific acts of
violence committed by kids, and against kids, and its effects on
the nation. ``(In this country), a catharsis seems only to occur
when the victims of the crimes are white and the killers are white
and the community affected is white,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   THE EROSION OF CIVIL RIGHTS FOR ASIAN-AMERICAN IMMIGRANTS. In
1988, Xuan Wilson forged a check for $19.83 at a grocery store. She
served her time and has since gotten her life back together. _ Yet
Wilson _ who is a legal permanent resident of the United States _
may be deported because of recent immigration laws passed by
Congress. If deported, she will have to leave behind her husband,
her parents and three small children _ all of whom are U.S.
citizens. In this commentary from A. magazine, Joann H. Lee, an
attorney with the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium
in Washington, D.C., reports on how the Anti-Terrorism and
Effective Death Penalty Act and the Illegal Immigration Reform and
Immigrant Responsibility Act punish this country's legal immigrants
with a vengeance that far exceeds the seriousness of their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGIOUS LIBERTY SHOULD NOT VIOLATE CIVIL RIGHTS FOR GAYS. The
Religious Liberty Protection Act (RLPA), which recently went
through the House of Representatives, would prevent state and local
governments from ``substantially burden(ing) a person's religious
exercise'' unless there is a demonstrably ``compelling'' reason to
do so. But in its current form the bill poses a very real threat to
gay civil rights because it lacks a civil-rights exemption that
prohibits the exercise of religious liberty as a justification for
denying employment and housing opportunities to gay men and
lesbians. ``What religious liberty rights would be lost or weakened
by the inclusion of a civil-rights provision?'' asks columnist
Chuck Colbert. In this commentary, Colbert argues that the Senate
should reject the RLPA unless lawmakers safeguard the civil rights
of gays. Colbert serves on the board of directors of the National
Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association.

   KILLING THE U.S.A. BY COUNTING PEOPLE. There is another attack

   PARTY _ In 1992, Ross Perot led an impassioned following of
angry, disaffected voters that caused fits for the campaigns of
President Bush and then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton. His independent
candidacy won almost 20 percent of the vote, the best showing for
an independent or third party presidential candidate in more than
half a century. And it sparked a debate that continues today about
whether he might have sealed Bush's defeat, even though exit polls
show that he probably drew almost equally from Democrats and
Republicans. Flash forward to 2000. Could a third party candidate
wield that kind of political clout again? 36. David Goldstein.

   VANISH: Cariann Lile's Israeli former boyfriend has vanished,
along with their 5-year-old son. But her appeals for help from the
Kansas City Police Department generated little response, and six
days passed before a missing-person's report was filed. Now, nearly
four weeks since the abduction, Lile is scared that her son may
have been taken to Israel. And she's mad at the cops, who admit
mistakes were made, but say they're now doing their best to find
father and son. And experts say that, if the boy has been taken to
Israel, it already may be too late to bring him back to Kansas
City. Matt Stearns. 47. Photos.

   Food-tea: When Granny served iced tea on the front porch, the
refreshing brew typically came in two flavors: sweetened and
unsweetened. Sure, she might add a squeeze of lemon. Or if she was
feeling really fancy-schmancy, a sprig of mint.
</P>
<P>
   But as we teeter on the brink of a new millennium, iced tea is
taking the New Age plunge, offering a host of new flavors designed
to please a generation weaned on sticky-sweet soda pop.
</P>
<P>
   A younger, health-conscious tea consumer is turning to hip new
brews with exotic flavors ranging from SoBe's Lemon Tea flavored
with lemon grass to Honest Tea's Moroccan Mint, a blend of green
tea with peppermint and ``barely sweetened'' with white clover
honey, to Tejava, a ``premium'' iced tea that is microbrewed from

   According to two studies led by Penn State nutritionist Jennifer

TAKE CARE OF YOUR `SUBOPTIMAL DEVELOPMENT'

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The American Academy of Pediatrics says parents
shouldn't let children younger than 2 watch television. Does this
mean they're going to pay for a sitter instead?
</P>
<P>
   PBS has the only show dedicated to those under 2, and that's
``Teletubbies.'' Take that away from the little ones and they're
going to make Woodstock '99 look like a convention of Jesuits
talking about baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows that unsupervised TV is bad for kids, but saying
that programs aimed at the very young can be a ``health'' problem
is a real stretch. Dr. Marjorie Hogan, one of the authors of the
study, said that egregious viewing by toddlers leads to ``lifelong
suboptimal development.''
</P>
<P>
   What happens when you were raised on ``Gilligan's Island'' and
``The Brady Bunch''?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the good doctor is on to something. Half of America
couldn't tell you where Montana is on a map but knows Ward
Cleaver's work phone number.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ___ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cable really hates this, but it's true: Six of the Top 10 shows
are wrestling related.
</P>
<P>
   Comedy Central is touting that, in the war for male viewers,
``The Man Show'' is the clear winner. According to Comedy Central,
771,000 men between 18 and 34 watch the show, while 418,000 of the
same watch ``Happy Hour' on USA and 35,000 watch ``The X Show'' on
FX. But, really, if you want to make magic with math, isn't it more
interesting that as we approach the 21st century, you still can get
1,224,000 males to own up to watching a little T&AMP;A?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ___ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the guys who started the Gen-X media event known as
``Lead or Leave'' _ basically twentysomethings telling Congress
that they'll vote instead of watching ``The Real World'' _ has a
new TV show.
</P>
<P>
   His name is Rob Nelson and his ``The Full Nelson'' talk show
will be seen by all eight people who get the Fox News Channel.
</P>
<P>
   To which we say: Dude, you wanted to change the world and now
you're on Fox. Manny the Hippie had a bigger impact.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ___ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and some concerned
simian lovers have said that TBS's ``The Chimp Channel'' must go
because it's cruel to chimpanzees.
</P>
<P>
   But, like a lot of politically correct protests, the group
doesn't have all the facts and admits that it doesn't know for sure
if the animals are being mistreated. That hasn't stopped it from
making Ted Turner look like he's denigrating Jane Goodall.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we hear that Jane Fonda is out of the picture for
Turner now, so maybe after some ``Me Tarzan, you Jane'' ape jokes
and some cocktails, all of this will blow over.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ___ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forget ``The Sopranos,'' here's the real reason to get cable: A
study found that households that have cable TV make $14,733 more
than those without.
</P>
<P>
   You may look at that and say, ``Makes sense. Those people can
afford cable.'' We look at it and say: Getting cable makes you
richer. Put that in your ``lifelong suboptimal development'' pipe
and smoke it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ___ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At least they didn't air it in sweeps: The History Channel,
which we love for its ``Military Blunders'' program alone, will air
a five-part special called ``The History of Sex'' on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   With that kind of leeway on content, anything is possible. Next
week: ``The History of Guys Punching Each Other in the Face.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ___ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And we may not have to wait long: A syndication group that
brought ``The Toughman World Championship Series'' to the FX cable
channel _ that's ordinary Joes going medieval on each other in the
ring _ is launching the National Boxing League. Eight ``teams'' in
the biggest media markets would square off against each other in
weight classes. The logic is you're more likely to root for your
city heroes than one lone fighter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ___ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Dollar'' Bill Bradley _ the former senator from New Jersey and
candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination _ has pulled
in the biggest names in Hollywood for fund-raising, though Vice
President Al Gore hasn't done so badly himself.
</P>
<P>
   We can be wonkish with our political content if we want, but
we'll simplify it this way: We love Bradley in those great
``SportsCenter'' commercials, and Gore hasn't done so badly on the
late-night talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   As for George W. Bush Jr., a Republican candidate for the
presidency, we're still hurt by his dad dissing ``The Simpsons.''
And John McCain, the Republican senator from Arizona? He probably
has a ``Kill Your Television'' bumper sticker.

SAVARESE RETURN ADDS SCORING PUNCH TO FAILING REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   July 4, 1776: The American Revolution gets a jump-start with the
signing of the Declaration of Independence.
</P>
<P>
   July 4, 1999: The New England Revolution defeat the MetroStars,
3-2, to give their own campaign a lift with their eighth victory,
evening their record at .500 and giving them third place in the
Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   But both dates must seem like ancient history to the Revolution,
who are winless in four starts since their Independence Day
victory, the last a 3-2 shootout defeat in Colorado last week that
followed a 0-0 regulation tie.
</P>
<P>
   New England, now in fifth place, has been outscored, 11-3, in
regulation since its last win and is badly in need of some goals,
preferably early on in games.
</P>
<P>
   However, going into Thursday night's game at Foxborough against
the San Jose Clash, things may be looking up offensively for the
team and for forward Giovanni Savarese, who said Tuesday at
practice at Babson College that his injured knee has just about
healed and he's ready to end a three-game absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going down the home stretch,'' said team captain Mike Burns,
``it's going to be real important for us for Gio to stay healthy
and score some more goals for us. He's real dangerous when he gets
himself in good position.''
</P>
<P>
   Savarese, a popular star back home in Venezuela, had been a
consistent scorer with the MetroStars over three seasons (13, 13,
and 14 goals) prior to being traded here for Raul Diaz Arce over
the winter. An MLS All-Star in his rookie year of 1996, Savarese
has hit the net six times for New England, but there have been a
couple of painful interludes (ankle and knee) along the way. Both
injuries occurred in practices and resulted in three games missed.
</P>
<P>
   Savarese isn't about to push the panic button for himself or his
team. ``I'd be worried if we didn't have players who could score,''
he said. ``But we have plenty of players who can score. It's not a
lack of talent. It's not something we can't turn around.''
</P>
<P>
   Savarese, who plays in Venezuela after the MLS season is
completed and has scored some big goals for his national team, felt
the trade to New England came at the right time. ``I gave
everything for (the MetroStars),'' he said. ``I wasn't sure if it
was the same the other way around. When your own fans who want you
to stay say it's better if you go, then it's time for a change, and
I welcomed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Savarese, who still fires a few practice shots at his dad, a
keeper, when he's back in Venezuela, didn't take long to make his
presence felt with his new team. His goal 22 seconds into the
opener at Miami gave the Revolution a 1-0 lead in a game they would
eventually lose in a shootout. It's not a league record for fastest
goal, but it's the quickest score in the MLS this year.
</P>
<P>
   During his three years with New York/New Jersey, Savarese stayed
relatively injury-free. But the week after the Miami game, he was
tackled during a scrimmage and suffered the ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just when I started feeling good again, I hurt the knee,'' he
said. ``Hopefully, this will be the last bad luck for me and for
the team. It's been a tough season for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Player-coach Walter Zenga, who tweaked his left knee in a
collision with a teammate in Colorado, got some good news Tuesday
after the results of an MRI revealed nothing worse than a deep
bruise. The injury, however, will keep him out of Thursday's game,
so Jeff Causey will get the start in goal. Backing him up will be
Boston Bulldogs keeper Anthony Latronica, who trained with the
Revolution in Italy in preseason . . . Defender Dan Calichman (hip
and groin) is doubtful for the San Jose game.

PGA, CUP PLAYERS GIVE SCRUTINY TO THE MONEY ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ On the eve of the 81st PGA Championship, the
focus can actually turn to golf. At least that is what the players
and PGA of America officials are hoping.
</P>
<P>
   In a closed-door, hour-long meeting with 16 prospective members
of the United States Ryder Cup team late Tuesday afternoon,
officials from the PGA of America listened to the players' concerns
about where the money from next month's matches at The Country Club
in Brookline, Mass., will go.
</P>
<P>
   It is a $63 million event that reportedly will gross the PGA of
America $17 million. The players are not paid, save for a $5,000
stipend, and some _ most notably David Duval _ have expressed a
desire to have a say in which charities get the profits.
</P>
<P>
   When the meeting was over, Jim Awtrey, the CEO of the PGA of
America, indicated that a truce had been called. He stopped short
of calling it a peace agreement, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are details to work out,'' said Awtrey. ``What we've
agreed to do is to sit down and work toward making sure that we go
forward with charitable contributions, that we seek input from the
players, and that's basically what this was about.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Awtrey said, ``I don't really believe there's an
issue'' between the PGA of America and the PGA Tour players. He
said it is an old topic, one that was rekindled by comments made by
Duval in this month's issue of Golf Digest. In that article, Duval
talked about players getting paid, not for personal profit but to
distribute the money to charities of their choice. It thrust Duval
into the center of the controversy, though Tuesday he expressed
disappointment that stories painted him as the leader of a proposed
boycott.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, there was a lot of reference to me saying that we
were going to boycott and that we should be paid and that type of
thing,'' said Duval. ``I answered the question about what it would
take to change things. I said it would take players not playing. I
have a hard time, as a person, figuring out where that's saying
it's a boycott.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never said I wanted to be paid. I said I think that we
should have monies to go back to our local communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval's quotes reportedly upset some players, particularly since
he has never played in a Ryder Cup, but others agreed with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he said some good things,'' said one player. ``I think
it opened the door to have this meeting, and good things will come
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods is another who shares the same view as Duval.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the money that's being made, I think we should have a
say in where it goes,'' said Woods. ``I know whatever amount I
would receive would go to charities that I have worked with in the
past, and my own foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   As the meeting ended, the players scattered, some to the putting
green, others to the driving range.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone is together, and we're looking forward to
playing,'' said Duval as he moved past reporters to a rear exit of
the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the locker room, Steve Pate, one of those at the
meeting, said, ``Basically, it was about, which charity is the
money going to? It is a question of who has control.''
</P>
<P>
   The PGA of America does, said Awtrey, but there are no hidden
mirrors or trap doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've shared with them the issue of where the money's going
and what the PGA is all about, and they're supportive of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Since it is a nonprofit organization, the PGA of America created
the Ryder Cup Outreach Program, which distributes profits to First
Tee, a PGA Learning Center in Florida, PGA of America education
programs, and other growth-of-sport projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PGA of America is about charity,'' said Awtrey. ``The
players and everyone understands that. So I think we're united.''
</P>
<P>
   Outwardly, perhaps. Tom Lehman flashed a thumbs-up as he left
the meeting, and Jeff Maggert, wearing a sheepish smile, said, ``We
all agreed on everything.''
</P>
<P>
   But will the PGA of America literally give money to future Ryder
Cup players so that they can distribute it to the charity of their
choice? Awtrey danced around that one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't gone into any level of detail,'' he said. ``We've
come to an understanding of what we both wanted to do. And, yes,
we're going to be talking to the players about the charitable
contributions and what we can do that lets everybody feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   What would feel good, said one player as he watched a group of
reporters hover around a door waiting for the meeting to end, would
be the start of the tournament so that people could start talking
about golf.
</P>
<P>
   His wish will come true Thursday at 7:40 a.m. here at Medinah CC
when a club pro from Baltimore, Wayne DeFrancesco, strikes the
first tee shot to officially begin this PGA Championship. And
unlike the Ryder Cup, this isn't for charity; the tournament's
purse is $3 million.

   When I was growing up in a nice, relatively safe, lower-middle
class neighborhood of tidy bungalows, concrete porches, one-car
garages and backyard patios half the size of an NBA free-throw
lane, we had very specific definitions of what it meant to be rich.
</P>
<P>
   If your dad bought a new Lincoln Continental or Cadillac Coupe
de Ville every two years, you were rich.
</P>
<P>
   If your family took an airplane on vacations to exotic locales
such as Orlando rather than squeezing everybody sausage-style into
a wood-paneled station wagon for a drive to the Wisconsin Dells,
you were rich.
</P>
<P>
   If people in your family golfed, you were rich.
</P>
<P>
   If you had a color TV with remote control and your driveway was
paved, you were rich.
</P>
<P>
   If each kid in your family had his or her own bedroom, you were
rich.
</P>
<P>
   And if you had a built-in swimming pool in your backyard, well,
you were practically dripping money.
</P>
<P>
   In this tiny corner of the world, the families of dentists and
doctors and lawyers were our Rockefellers and Kennedys and DuPonts.
We didn't know from millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   But almost everybody had a story about how the family could have
been seriously, filthy rich, if only Grandpa or Uncle Freddy or
Great-Aunt Minnie had made the right move in 1893 or 1914 or 1937.
</P>
<P>
   Like my buddy Shemp _ so nicknamed because of the way his hair
always fell across his face, ala Shemp of the Three Stooges. He was
always talking about how his great-grandfather had blown the
opportunity to buy a chunk of a fledgling company that was going to
make a product called Pepsi-Cola. If only!
</P>
<P>
   Who knows if it was true. No doubt great-grandpa passed along
that story as true fact and it traveled through the generations,
just as lots of other relatives from the old days were telling
similar tales. We all had Willy Lomans in our family trees,
lamenting from the grave that they didn't go into the jungle like
brother Ben, who came out a rich man.
</P>
<P>
   I know what my descendants (assuming there are any) are going to
be saying 75 years from now. Something like, ``My family could be
stinkin' rich today, if only my stupid great-grandfather Richard
the First had bought stock in eBay when he had the chance in the
late 1990s!''
</P>
<P>
   Or Amazon, or Yahoo, or America Online. Or Priceline or uBid or
iVillage or DoubleClick, or any of those other darned ``dot-com''
stocks you and I didn't buy when we had the chance, dadgummit!
</P>
<P>
   Too late now. According to people who know these things, most of
the above stocks will probably never reach the value they once
held. And we're certainly well past the point where you could have
bought into one of those companies at a few bucks a share and
watched your investment increase fiftyfold.
</P>
<P>
   The current issue of Time magazine has an article on the
plunging prices of Internet stocks, including a little
picture-chart showing how the heads of some well-known companies
have seen their worths decline greatly in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com used to be worth $13
billion, but now he's worth only $5.3 billion. And Margaret Whitman
of eBay has seen her worth decline from $1.6 billion to a mere $569
million.
</P>
<P>
   Yet I'm still willing to say: Margaret, will you marry me?
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to feel sorry for these people with their
``silly money.'' (That's when you have so much money it's just
plain silly.) All you can do is shake your head and be solid in the
knowledge that are other companies out there right now offering
incredible investment opportunities _ and you'll miss out on those
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's not just the kabillionaire founders who have
made silly money over the last few years; a lot of people have
become rich playing the market. Forget about building a company
from the ground up or working your way to the top of a law firm or
laboring for 15 years to invent an ingenious device that improves
the quality of life for millions of people. It's a lot easier to
buy a few thousand shares of an Internet stock that suddenly
explodes and turns you into an instant millionaire at 27.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone who has pulled off the latter trick doesn't
deserve the money. If you make a brilliant and/or lucky investment
and it flowers into an entire meadow of money, God love ya.
</P>
<P>
   But it kind of reminds me of the talented but usually unknown
authors who win the ``Oprah lottery'' and suddenly find themselves

<P>
   When I was growing up in a nice, relatively safe, lower-middle
class neighborhood of tidy bungalows, concrete porches, one-car
garages and backyard patios half the size of an NBA free-throw
lane, we had very specific definitions of what it meant to be rich.
</P>
<P>
   If your dad bought a new Lincoln Continental or Cadillac Coupe
de Ville every two years, you were rich.
</P>
<P>
   If your family took an airplane on vacations to exotic locales
such as Orlando rather than squeezing everybody sausage-style into
a wood-paneled station wagon for a drive to the Wisconsin Dells,
you were rich.
</P>
<P>
   If people in your family golfed, you were rich.
</P>
<P>
   If you had a color TV with remote control and your driveway was
paved, you were rich.
</P>
<P>
   If each kid in your family had his or her own bedroom, you were
rich.
</P>
<P>
   And if you had a built-in swimming pool in your backyard, well,
you were practically dripping money.
</P>
<P>
   In this tiny corner of the world, the families of dentists and
doctors and lawyers were our Rockefellers and Kennedys and DuPonts.
We didn't know from millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   But almost everybody had a story about how the family could have
been seriously, filthy rich, if only Grandpa or Uncle Freddy or
Great-Aunt Minnie had made the right move in 1893 or 1914 or 1937.
</P>
<P>
   Like my buddy Shemp _ so nicknamed because of the way his hair
always fell across his face, ala Shemp of the Three Stooges. He was
always talking about how his great-grandfather had blown the
opportunity to buy a chunk of a fledgling company that was going to
make a product called Pepsi-Cola. If only!
</P>
<P>
   Who knows if it was true. No doubt great-grandpa passed along
that story as true fact and it traveled through the generations,
just as lots of other relatives from the old days were telling
similar tales. We all had Willy Lomans in our family trees,
lamenting from the grave that they didn't go into the jungle like
brother Ben, who came out a rich man.
</P>
<P>
   I know what my descendants (assuming there are any) are going to
be saying 75 years from now. Something like, ``My family could be
stinkin' rich today, if only my stupid great-grandfather Richard
the First had bought stock in eBay when he had the chance in the
late 1990s!''
</P>
<P>
   Or Amazon, or Yahoo, or America Online. Or Priceline or uBid or
iVillage or DoubleClick, or any of those other darned ``dot-com''
stocks you and I didn't buy when we had the chance, dadgummit!
</P>
<P>
   Too late now. According to people who know these things, most of
the above stocks will probably never reach the value they once
held. And we're certainly well past the point where you could have
bought into one of those companies at a few bucks a share and
watched your investment increase fiftyfold.
</P>
<P>
   The current issue of Time magazine has an article on the
plunging prices of Internet stocks, including a little
picture-chart showing how the heads of some well-known companies
have seen their worths decline greatly in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com used to be worth $13
billion, but now he's worth only $5.3 billion. And Margaret Whitman
of eBay has seen her worth decline from $1.6 billion to a mere $569
million.
</P>
<P>
   Yet I'm still willing to say: Margaret, will you marry me?
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to feel sorry for these people with their
``silly money.'' (That's when you have so much money it's just
plain silly.) All you can do is shake your head and be solid in the
knowledge that are other companies out there right now offering
incredible investment opportunities _ and you'll miss out on those
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's not just the kabillionaire founders who have
made silly money over the last few years; a lot of people have
become rich playing the market. Forget about building a company
from the ground up or working your way to the top of a law firm or
laboring for 15 years to invent an ingenious device that improves
the quality of life for millions of people. It's a lot easier to
buy a few thousand shares of an Internet stock that suddenly
explodes and turns you into an instant millionaire at 27.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone who has pulled off the latter trick doesn't
deserve the money. If you make a brilliant and/or lucky investment
and it flowers into an entire meadow of money, God love ya.
</P>
<P>
   But it kind of reminds me of the talented but usually unknown
authors who win the ``Oprah lottery'' and suddenly find themselves
giving interviews about what it's like to see their book catapult
from nowhere to the top of The New York Times' bestseller list.
It's a wonderful windfall, and any writer feeling the tap of
Oprah's sword on their shoulder would have to be insane to decline
her offer of instant riches and fame _ but I wonder if there's
something just slightly bittersweet about the triumph. Wouldn't it
be better if a half-million people bought your book because they
really wanted to, not because a TV talk show host told them to?
</P>
<P>
   And wouldn't it be more satisfying to achieve fabulous wealth
through something more tangible, rewarding and life-affirming than
the wild rise of an Internet stock? Wouldn't anyone prefer to
really and truly earn that hundred million?

<P>
   In six months, Russia is supposed to begin full-scale
destruction of its chemical weapons, according to the Treaty on the
Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of
Chemical Weapons and Their Destruction. The State Duma ratified it
in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1999, however, the members passed a resolution saying
that the country lacked the conditions for safe destruction of
chemical weapons. Today in Russia it is far more dangerous to
destroy than to store chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   True, it is extremely dangerous to store chemical weapons,
especially in densely populated areas, which is where the majority
of our arsenals are located.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the year before last, forest fires very nearly
reached a major site of chemical-weapon storage facilities _ that
was a close shave; it's a miracle we were spared. Yet we must get
rid of this hazard in a proper way, without further endangering
people's life and health.
</P>
<P>
   According to preliminary, conservative estimates, the
chemical-weapons destruction program costs 32 billion rubles (about
$1.3 billion). From year to year, however, the program has been
badly underfunded. For instance, the 1999 budget provides for a
mere 5.4 percent of the necessary expenditure.
</P>
<P>
   We have already done untold harm by producing huge stockpiles of
chemical weapons, storing them carelessly and hastily getting rid
of them. According to the Russian State Committee for the
Environment and Natural Resources, in the Penza region, near the
railroad station of Leonidovka, soil samples were taken in areas of
presumed post-war destruction of chemical ammunition. Tests showed
that the arsenic concentration was 100 to 78,000 times higher than
the permissible level! Bottom sediments in a water spring of the
Zhdanka stream (barely a mile away from the weapons destruction
site) had a concentration of arsenic between three and 45 times the
safety level; chromium, four to 10 times; and lead, 1.4 to 3.4
times.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bezymyanny stream, which is very close to the Surskoye
water reservoir that supplies drinking water to the 600,000 &QC; strong
population of Penza and the town of Zarechny, the
arsenic concentration is eight times the safety level and chromium,
2.9 times.
</P>
<P>
   Or take Lake Mokhovoye _ local residents call it a ``dead
lake'': There is absolutely no vegetation there with all trees on
the banks long dead. The lake was used for underwater explosive
demolition of toxic chemical air bombs. Today the lake bed
sediments have a concentration of arsenic 2 to 7 times the maximum
permissible level.
</P>
<P>
   The military say that these horrendous statistics must not be
disclosed lest they cause panic. But we have to disclose them _
first, in order to start a clean-up of the contaminated areas
without delay; second, so that everyone realizes how dangerous the
irresponsible destruction of chemical weapons can be.
</P>
<P>
   We have yet to adopt laws regulating the storage, transportation
and disposal of chemical weapons and reimbursement of damage in the
event of accidents at weapons storage and disposal facilities, laws
ensuring industrial and environmental safety and social protection
of citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Why has the State Duma, which unanimously voted in favor of
ratifying the treaty, not passed the necessary laws? Because
implementation of these laws requires money, which the treasury
does not have.
</P>
<P>
   When in 1997, the Duma adopted the law on the destruction of
chemical weapons, I insisted that it provide for at least the basic
social guarantees for those engaged in the destruction process.
Indeed, given our financial situation, it was unrealistic to expect
voluntary provision of the means to ensure social protection.
</P>
<P>
   But the deputies succumbed to pressure from the military, which
was claiming that unless the treaty was ratified, Russia's
international prestige would suffer and economic sanctions would be
slapped on us. If, however, it was ratified, the international
community would pick up much of the tab for the destruction of our
chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, foreign aid covers only 5 percent or 6 percent of
this cost while failure to implement a ratified treaty entails far
more serious hazards. We were simply dragged into a dangerous and
costly venture.
</P>
<P>
   There was absolutely no need for us to emulate the United
States. There it was indeed a matter of great urgency to destroy
old stockpiles of chemical weapons because of leaky tanks. Our
tanks, however, are perfectly all right, what with Soviet industry
having been the most metal-intensive in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Congress, unlike our parliament, held months-long
debates before ratifying this treaty. We are worlds apart from
America in the economic, technological and legal means of ensuring
the safe implementation of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   If people who actually destroy chemical weapons are not
guaranteed security and social protection, who will want to do this
job?
</P>
<P>
   It would, of course, be best if the country's chemical weapons
were destroyed by those who once manufactured them. They have
special knowledge and experience in handling toxic agents. But the
majority of our chemical enterprises have been privatized by now
and do not take orders from the state.
</P>
<P>
   So instead, a ``very simple solution'' has been found: Let the
weapons be destroyed by those who store them. That is to say, by
the military. If it is the military, everything will be done in
secrecy, outside the scrutiny of the public. But for sure, with
this, you can forget about social protection and environmental
safety oversight.
</P>
<P>
   We will see inexperienced youngsters put out in the field at
minimal pay to do a highly dangerous job in a rush. They are bound
to get poisoned. They will not only become cripples themselves but
will also bear sick children. Then we'll be tearing at our hair but
it will be too late. We will have tens of thousands of new cripples
in addition to those who handled the cleanup of the Chernobyl
nuclear accident. And tens of thousands of sick children.
</P>
<P>
   And what is to be done now? For a start, set up an
interdepartmental commission that would appraise the existing
economic, technological and legal base to ensure the implementation
of the treaty together with environmentalists and doctors.
</P>
<P>
   If the commission confirms that Russia is indeed not ready for
the safe destruction of chemical weapons, we must then invoke those
articles of the treaty allowing for the unilateral suspension of
this document.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Many years ago, when there were no entry barriers to the
profession, I was a business writer. I got started in the late
1970s, during what one no longer calls the Arab oil crisis, when
every expert in the world was predicting that oil would soon cost
$50 or $100 a barrel. (It now costs $21 a barrel.)
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every story we wrote presaged the crashing and burning
of the US economy. Our logic, such as it was, derived from the
phrase ``if present trends continue,'' which we inserted
prominently in our articles. What we wrote proved to be complete
rubbish; the oil crisis preceded the longest sustained economic
boom in postwar history. Our rivals at The Wall Street Journal
printed similar bunk, but used the covering phrase ``statistics are
hard to come by'' to justify their own flights of fancy.
</P>
<P>
   The main thing was, we had plausible deniability. We never
stated outright that our grim predictions would come to pass. We
said they would occur ``if present trends continue.'' Which, of
course, they never do.
</P>
<P>
   So, if present trends continue:
</P>
<P>
   Harry Potter will be more popular than Jesus Christ, and no one
will ever read Robertson Davies's ``Fifth Business,'' a much better
book about a young child's coming of age in the world of magic.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth ``Star Wars'' installment will be the worst movie ever
made.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Investments will somehow come up with a worse ad
campaign than the current Peter Lynch-Don Rickles clunkers.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox will finish the season in fifth place.
</P>
<P>
   Cash-hungry parents will start auctioning off their children on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The initial public offering of eSLAVE.com will be valued at $300
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times will re-report the tabloid Globe's exclusive
account of George W. Bush's hot coat-hanger ``branding'' at Yale's
drunken-madhouse fraternity, Delta Kappa Epsilon.
</P>
<P>
   Authors will give up writing books, and merely provide
legitimizing publicity blurbs for celebrity biographies.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette will launch the Mach 4 razor and declare bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>

HARPER'S AND ESQUIRE'S SOUTHERN ACCENTS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Harper's journeys to South Carolina, where it found a corollary
to a famous truism: Money corrupts, and gambling money corrupts
absolutely. There is absolutely nothing redeeming about South
Carolina's strain of state-supported gambling, except as a case
study in how not to go about it, as writer David Plotz relates in
devastating fashion: ``The state collects no taxes, imposes
virtually no regulations, does not restrict who can own machines,
does not require that the machines be honest, does not forbid
children from playing them.'' There are practically no broad
economic spinoffs from South Carolina's gambling model.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina has not held a statewide referendum on whether
gambling should be legal, and when countywide votes were conducted
_ and a dozen voted to ban it _ a court voided the election; the
state's courts have repeatedly come down on the side of gambling
interests. Governor David Beasley proposed banning video poker in
1998, provoking an outpouring of money from gambling moguls that
amounted to $6 for every vote against him, and he was tossed out.
</P>
<P>
   Under Jim Hodges, a formerly outspoken gambling foe who
benefited from the anti-Beasley torrent, the state has moved to
take its share of the gambling take. Plotz says this is of no
bother to the state's homegrown gambling moguls; it will merely
institutionalize _ and perpetuate _ their industry.
</P>
<P>
   Esquire, meanwhile, features Georgian Max Cleland, a heroic
figure almost without parallel. He is the soldier who lost both his
legs and part of his right arm in Vietnam, but has persevered to
continue in service to his nation, as Veterans Administration chief
under Jimmy Carter, now as a first-term US senator.
</P>
<P>
   Writer Charles Bowden and photographer Bruce Davidson were given
full access to the senator, which resulted in a startling nude shot
of Cleland as he goes through the stretching that's part of his
three-hour regimen to prepare for each day. But the writing is
flat, not at all up to the level of its subject.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the story about bad was good. The one about good was
bad.

CENSUS ON TRACK, OFFICIAL SAYS 
</HEADLINE>

 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Aided by a cross-country canvass, the Census Bureau
has created a mega-list of 120 million addresses, the first crucial
step in locating and counting every US household in the year 2000,
bureau director Kenneth Prewitt says.
</P>
<P>
   Now all the agency has to do to prepare for an accurate
headcount of an estimated 275 million people is hire 860,000
temporary enumerators in a tight labor market, open 520 offices,
launch a $166 million advertising campaign that Prewitt promised
would be ``culturally sensitive'' and carefully targeted at racial
and ethnic groups, and get Congress to agree to fully fund the
census at $6.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the big picture? That the census is on schedule and
that it is operationally where it needs to be to be in the field
next January and February,'' Prewitt said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   After months of partisan combat on Capitol Hill over how the
bureau should conduct the 2000 Census, Prewitt said he expects the
agency to get the federal funding it needs, including an extra $1.7
billion the Clinton administration recently requested.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Supreme Court ruled that the Census Bureau could
not statistically sample, or estimate, the US population for
purposes of reapportioning the House of Representatives. The
bureau, backed by the White House and congressional Democrats,
wanted to use sampling as a way to reduce census error, which
disproportionately undercounts minorities and children.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said the bureau has redesigned its plan ``to do as full
an enumeration as humanly possible.'' To avoid the 1990 undercount
of 1.6 percent of the population, or about 4.5 million people, he
said, the agency is taking the following steps:
</P>
<P>
   --The bureau has updated Postal Service address lists and is
checking the accuracy of its master list with local officials.
Getting addresses is critical, because census forms are mailed in
March and April to every known residence, and census-takers then
are deployed to every address that does not return a form.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said getting an up-to-date list, which turned out to be
2 million addresses longer than expected, is ``a very major
accomplishment'' because dwellings are constantly being built,
demolished, and changed from single- to multi-family residences.
</P>
<P>
   --The bureau will open 520 field offices across the country over
the next five months, and four vast data-capturing centers are
scheduled to be operational early next year. Using the most
sophisticated scanning technology, the centers would process data
from each census form within 24 hours of its receipt, Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   --The Census Bureau is preparing to launch the largest
public-awareness campaign in its history, and for the first time,
it is using paid advertising to tell people that the census is
confidential and crucial to their communities. Census counts
determine how federal aid is distributed and even where schools,
plants, and shopping centers are built.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said New York advertising giant Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc.,
has the census account, but it has subcontracted part of the work
to four minority firms that will target ``hard-to-count'' Asian,
Hispanic, African-American, and Native American groups. ``We are
trying to be enormously culturally sensitive,'' Prewitt said. He
noted the advertising will be in 24 languages and aimed at
motivating ethnic and minority groups that historically don't
participate in the census, either because they don't understand the
language or don't trust the government.
</P>
<P>
   --Because the response to three census mailings is still
expected to be no better than 61 percent, the bureau plans to hire
more than 860,000 enumerators who starting next spring will knock
on doors for census data. Prewitt said the bureau will try to
attract that size of a labor force wages of $8 to $14 an hour and
the promise of flexible schedules that might appeal to students,
teachers, and retired poeple.
</P>
<P>
   While the bureau is not specifically screening employees for
race and ethnicity, it will ``code'' the attributes of job
applicants and try to match them with the characteristics of the
neighborhoods where they will work, Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to have to find 42 million people,'' Prewitt
said. ``It doesn't mean a black college kid can't handle the
enumeration of a white neighborhood, but it does mean we need to
find the right people to get into a gated community or knows the
language'' spoken in another neighborhood, he said.
</P>
<P>
   J. Kenneth Blackwell, whom Congress appointed as co-chairman of
the US Census Monitoring Board, which oversees the 2000 count, said
it is ``very important to have trusted third parties who live or
work in the community'' as census counters because he does not
expect the advertising campaign to reach many minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Blackwell said, is that the counters hired by the
Census Bureau must pass a long multiple-choice test that requires
literacy, basic math skills, and fairly sophisticated understanding
of privacy rights. In some communities, Blackwell said, only 10
percent of people taking the test have passed it.

ONTARIO FISHING RULES SEEN AS A THREAT IN MINNESOTA

<P>
   KENORA, Ontario _ First there was the cod war, with Canadian
patrol boats slashing the trawl gear and seizing the boats of New
England fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the salmon war, with British Columbia fishermen
blockading an Alaska-bound US ferry while the premier of that
western province railed against Uncle Sam.
</P>
<P>
   Now another nasty fish fight is looming between the United
States and Canada, this time over a buttery-tasting game fish that
Americans call walleye and Canadians know as pickerel.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the widening fracas is a new Canadian regulation
requiring American anglers to stay in Ontario fishing lodges as a
condition for hooking walleye in Canada's portion of Lake of the
Woods. The lake's famed fishing waters cover 1,215 square miles
between Minnesota and Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   The rule could spell economic ruin for an obscure American
enclave wedged between Manitoba and Ontario. Nearly all of the 90
or so doughty inhabitants of Minnesota's Northwest Angle _ a
geographic oddity that has no land link to the rest of the state _
make their living catering to sports fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   So the Angle is threatening, loudly, to secede from the United
States, saying that may be the only way left to legally snare
fishermen under Ontario's revised rules.
</P>
<P>
   But first, vow denizens of the enclave, there's going to be one
doozy of fight over Stizostedion vitreum, Latin name for the fish
also known as yellow pickerel, dore, and walleye pike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to raise hell until this issue is resolved,'' said
Gary Dietzler, owner of a bar and fishing lodge in the Northwest
Angle's only settlement, Angle Inlet. ``Or we're going to join
Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   The howls of outrage from the obscure patch of US turf are
echoing far beyond the spectacularly island-studded Lake of the
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   In the Minnesota capital, St. Paul, the pique over pickerel has
pro wrestler-turned-governor Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura threatening
to shut down a 43-mile section of Canadian National railway that
curves into Minnesota on its way from Manitoba to Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the kind of person you want mad at you,'' the
250-pound governor warned Canada.
</P>
<P>
   And in Washington last week, Ontario's crackdown on Americans
hoping to hook a panful of the delectable game fish caused the US
government to file a formal complaint under the North American Free
Trade Agreement, starting a process that could ignite a serious
trade dispute between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Charlene Barshefsky, the US trade representative, said: ``We are
concerned by Canada's . . . discriminatory practices that have a
severe negative effect on Minnesota's sport-fishing and tourism
industries.''
</P>
<P>
   All this over a chunk of American territory that, on a map,
looks as if it shouldn't be where it is in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The Northwest Angle is the most northerly piece of the lower 48,
occupying a small peninsula jutting from the eastern edge of
Manitoba on Lake of the Woods. Its inhabitants must drive some 20
miles of gravel road through Canada to regain their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   The origins of the Angle are obscure. According to one account,
it remained part of the United States because its fiercely patrotic
people refused to join Canada when the international line was drawn
between the two countries. As this tale goes, Ottawa didn't dare
send the Northwest Canadian Mounted Police to force such
pugnaciously red-blooded Yanks to kneel before the Maple Leaf.
</P>
<P>
   A less rousing and more likely explanation is that surveyors
after the War of 1812 drew a line running northwest from the outlet
of Rainy River _ thereby creating the peculiar piece _ in order to
guarantee Americans access to the headwaters of the Mississippi,
which were then mistakenly thought to rise due west of Lake of the
Woods (the river actually starts to the south).
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the Northwest Angle is as much a part of United
States as Boston or Boise, although its existence has seldom, if
ever, been noticed much beyond Lake of the Woods.
</P>
<P>
   That's changing as the Angle becomes the flashpoint in this
latest trade row, which started last year with Ontario's abrupt
announcement that Americans fishing for pickerel in Canadian waters
must stay at Canadian hotels or lodges as a price for the right to
fish.
</P>
<P>
   The huge majority of anglers fishing the Lake of the Woods are
well-heeled Americans, and there is intense competition between
Minnesota and Ontario for a share of their business. Fishing and
related tourism generate $60 million a year for the economically
hard-pressed communities on the lake's shores.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Americans fishing on the Canadian side _ which,
because of the geology of the lake, is richer in walleyes and other
game fish _ were required only to buy a Canadian fishing license to
catch their quota. They were free to sleep, eat and frolic where
they chose, whether in Ontario or the rustic inns of the Northwest
Angle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our survival comes from providing beds to anglers, guiding for
them, renting them boats, or selling them booze, food, tackle,''
said Dietzler. ``And our business has declined by nearly 50 percent
in the last year. It's a real hit below the belt.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada insists its motives are purely environmental, portraying
the new rule as a noble effort to protect pickerel stocks from
overfishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about conservation, Ontario is doing what it can to
preserve its walleye or pickerel,'' said Ryan Sword, a spokesman
for Ontario's Ministry of Natural Resources. ``Ultimately, this
ministry is responsible for the long-term survival of fish stock in
Ontario waters.''
</P>
<P>
   But American critics dismiss the conservation claim as a cynical
ploy. ``They are waving the ecological flag to cover a raw grab for
fishing dollars,'' said Dietzler, whose dock lies just a few
hundred feet from Ontario's waters. ``And, anyway, there are better
ways to do conservation than killing your neighbor's business.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans argue that the greater threat to the lake's walleye
stocks come from the wide nets of commercial fishermen _ all of
them Canadians working Ontario waters _ not by the relatively small
numbers of fish hooked by sport fishers. That argument is generally
backed by scientists of both countries.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Americans say, it's ludicrous for Canada to assert
that it is protecting walleyes by requiring US anglers to stay at
Canadian lodges.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about scarcity, this is about unfair rules meant
to force nonresident anglers to spend money in Canada as the
condition for taking the fish,'' said James Southwick, a
Minneapolis lawyer and former high-ranking US trade official.
``It's all about competing economic interests, not an endangered
resource. We see it as clearly a violation of NAFTA.''
</P>
<P>
   The US government agrees, accusing Canada last week of flouting
free trade agreements between the two countries by using fishing
regulations to give an artificial boost to Ontario's tourism
industry and undercutting fish lodges in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   American fishermen, of course, are still free to pull walleyes
from the US portion of the lake. Trouble is, the American swath of
Lake of the Woods, while huge, is mostly shallow, dense with water
weeds, and short on full-sized walleyes _ the fish spawn in US
waters, but prefer to glide through the deeper, cooler waters in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Lodge owners in the Northwest Angle are cheered by Washington's
tough response. But they wonder if the creaky machinery of
international trade law can grind quickly enough to save their
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the only solution is quitting the American republic to
join the next-door Dominion.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, the secessionist talk is partly just to make the
politicians stand up and take notice,'' said Dietzler. ``But
there's a logic, too. If we joined Canada, our guests would have
the same rights as guests at the Canadian lodges, and we'd be back
on the same competitive ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota politicians are ready for a rumble. Ventura said his
state is taking aim at a section of the Canadian National railway
that loops through a short section of Minnesota on its way from
Manitoba to Thunder Bay, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   A bill before the state's Legislature would slap hefty fees on
the Canadian freight trains that rumble through, laden with wheat
and lumber. And Ventura has hinted at dealing a body blow to Canada
by blocking the trains altogether until the fishing dispute is
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ontario isn't going to get away with blatantly unfair rules,''
he said. ``Canada shouldn't mess with Minnesota.''

<P>
   Picked-up pieces from the dusty trail in Tampa and beyond . . .
</P>
<P>
   --Would the Red Sox plese cease and desist with the new ballpark
propaganda carpet-bombing? They've hired every political operative
except Billy Bob Thornton and it's clear they've nudged some
big-time talent to weigh in on the issue. Reading Doris Kearns
Goodwin wax poetic on the new Fenway was believable, but who put
Ted Williams up to the task? Are we to believe that Ted vaulted out
of bed one morning and said to himself, ``I think I'll write an
editorial in favor of the new Fenway and send it to the Globe''?
</P>
<P>
   --Nice photo of Bob Kraft holding up the M-16 automatic rifle at
the football field groundbreaking in Jerusalem last week. It was
mildly reminiscent of Mike Dukakis in the tank during the 1988
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   --Speaking of Kraft, has anybody seen the latest Austin Powers
movie? This time, the Dr. Evil character has a shrunken version of
himself at his side and dubs the little guy ``Mini-Me.'' Mini-Me is
to Dr. Evil what Bob Kraft is to Jerry Jones and what John Calipari
is to Rick Pitino.
</P>
<P>
   --If you want to forget about the Red Sox, don't try a movie
house. As always, the Sox are everywhere. In ``The General's
Daughter,'' John Travolta tells the general how he helped calm him
down in Vietnam when he told him the Sox had just won the sixth
game of the 1967 World Series. In ``Summer of Sam,'' there's a
quick Jim Rice reference and a classic scene in which two New York
Italian homeboys beat the you-know-what out of a punk when the kid
announces that he's a Red Sox fan.
</P>
<P>
   --Lisa Coles, onetime head of the Patriot cheerleaders and
friend of former New England quarterback Hugh Millen, has surfaced
as a sportscaster for KCBS in Los Angeles and on NBC's daytime
soap, ``Sunset Beach.'' Coles was fired by the Pats in 1994 and
filed a suit claiming the team demanded she dress the cheerleaders
in skimpier outfits and use rock music instead of tunes by black
artists.
</P>
<P>
   --The late John F. Kennedy Jr. attended a Roger Clemens-pitched
Yankee game on the night before his fatal flight. John-John was a
6-year-old spectator with his mom when Red Sox rookie Billy Rohr
pitched a one-hitter against the Yankees in his major league debut
in April of 1967. Rohr signed a ball for young Kennedy after the
game.
</P>
<P>
   --Taking more than batting tips from Ted Williams, Wade Boggs
wore a Met-Rx cap at his 3,000-hit postgame press conference.
</P>
<P>
   --Great to see France's Jean Van de Velde holding the eighth
spot in the European Ryder Cup standings. The British Open's Bill
Buckner will be great for story material here in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   --I've booked New York hotels from Oct. 23 through Halloween.
And wouldn't Bobby Valentine be insufferable if there were a Subway
Series?
</P>
<P>
   --Phillies pitcher Paul Byrd told reporters that he had a
wonderful time during his Boston All-Star stay at the Westin. He
was stunned that it was so easy to get dinner reservations during
such a busy time. It probably had something to do with the fact
that his dad was making the calls for reservations. Paul's dad is
Larry Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   --Nice upcoming schedule for the Red Sox. It's Ken Griffey Jr. &AMP;
Co this weekend, then four with the wild-card threat Oakland A's
next week. This will be Griffey's first appearance in Fenway since
All-Star week, when he won the home run derby. New York Jets
publicist Berj Najarian caught Griffey's derby-winning home run
ball.
</P>
<P>
   --It's nice that Mark McGwire has been off androstenedione for
four months, but the timing of his announcement stings a little. He
said he quit andro so that kids wouldn't take the stuff, but why
did he wait so long to deliver the message? It looks as though
McGwire wanted to make sure he could still produce (and recover
from ailments) without andro before he swore off for good.
</P>
<P>
   --On Sept. 12, the Red Sox will be in Yankee Stadium at the same
time the Patriots are playing the Jets in the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   --Tony Conigliaro's rookie year: .290, 24 HRs, 52 RBIs. Brian
Daubach going into Tuesday night (50 games to play): .323, 16, 50.

   BOSTON -- Next month, amid the hubbub of the Ryder Cup at The
Country Club in Brookline, Tony Bennett will take the stage at
Symphony Hall, with John Williams and the Boston Pops, to croon
some tunes in tribute to a one of the great athletes of the
century, Arnold Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   The event has all the ingredients of one of those memorable
evenings that evoke the image of Boston as a grand place.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, no one would have imagined that ``The Gala: A
Tribute to Arnold Palmer and Golf'' could have anything to do with
a bunch of agents representing hockey and baseball players in an
office just down Huntington Avenue from Symphony Hall.
</P>
<P>
   But in the three years since Boston Garden executive Larry
Moulter, Bruins legend Bobby Orr, and ad executive Ed Eskandarian
bought Bob Woolf Associates, things have changed.
</P>
<P>
   The name, for one. Now it's simply Woolf Associates.
</P>
<P>
   The clients, for another. The agency, once dedicated almost
entirely to representing athletes such as Larry Bird, Julius
Erving, and Carl Yastrzemski, has expanded into new areas: managing
and owning major events, and advising companies on marketing
through sports and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've surprised a lot of people. Woolf is different today from
when we bought it,'' said Larry Moulter, president and chief
executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a major stumble in January in its aborted attempt to
represent the Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams, and with the
loss of long-time client Larry King, the radio and television
personality, Moulter says Woolf Associates is poised for continued
growth as an integrated marketing agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been about steadying our business and entering new
areas,'' Moulter said. ``Right now we have a platform _ I prefer to
look at it as a latform rather than a plateau _ from which to
launch the next growth era for Woolf.''
</P>
<P>
   It is all a long way from Earl Wilson's no-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching for the Red Sox at Fenway Park on June 26, 1962, Wilson
allowed the lowly Los Angeles Angels no hits in a nine-inning
victory. Endorsement offers began pouring in, and Wilson needed
help. A car accident and the need for a new contract with the Red
Sox eventually steered him to a criminal lawyer who had played a
little basketball at Boston College. His name: Bob Woolf.
</P>
<P>
   Woolf met Wilson in an era when professional athletes often
negotiated their own contracts, in deals sealed with a firm
handshake, a puff of cigar smoke, and the player's signature.
Within a decade, Woolf established Bob Woolf Associates and
single-handedly made that era seem as distant in time as Babe Ruth
pitching for the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   When competition narrowed the market in the late 1970s and
original clients began to retire, Bob Woolf Associates sought new
business. It arrived from Indiana, a basketball player named Larry
Bird who did for Woolf what he did for the Celtics, helping to
attract a new generation of clients to the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Woolf died suddenly in 1993 in a boat off Florida, apparently of
a heart attack. Afterward, his memory lost luster, as some clients
sued his estate alleging that he had made false claims.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of Woolf's death, Moulter, Orr, and Eskandarian
each, in his own way, were looking for something new.
</P>
<P>
   Moulter, as head of the old Boston Garden, had just played a
seminal role in the development of what would become the
FleetCenter. Orr had thrilled millions of hockey fans in a career
that revolutionized the game and that brought him fame throughout
New England and across Canada. But he had remained mindful that
some dirty play on the part of one of his agents had probably cost
him a substantial sum of money, including a possible ownership
interest in the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Eskandarian had been expanding his advertising firm, Arnold
Communications, in a series of acquisitions. He recognized a
similar opportunity in Bob Woolf Associates.
</P>
<P>
   With Woolf's son Gary and wife Anne looking to sell the firm,
Moulter envisioned his future. Eskandarian seems to have liked the
idea from the start, and the two men coaxed Orr to come along for
the ride. They bought the company for $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not something I was sure I wanted to get involved
with,'' Orr said. ``But from a number of perspectives, the money,
the work, the opportunity to work with young guys and guide their
careers, I am really happy that I said yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I like about it,'' Eskandarian said, ``is Larry is great
at running the operation and Bobby is sort of our standard. We want
to make sure we build relationships and treat our customers and our
athletes at the standard Bobby would treat them. He has a huge
input into what we do and how we do it.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been Moulter's role to manage turning the Bob Woolf
Associates ship in midcourse. No one would ever dominate the
business like Bob Woolf, and for the firm to be profitable, it had
to evolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a big, big ocean liner, but it still was a pretty
well-institutionalized business, and we had to move it around,''
Moulter said.

 BOSTON: ... Moulter said.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In three years, Woolf has made such strides into new areas that
Moulter says 40 percent of the revenue comes from businesses that
do not involve player representation. The goal, over the next few
years, is to make that distribution 50-50.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, annual revenue at Woolf has grown from $1.9 million
in 1996 to nearly $10 million last year, Moulter said.
</P>
<P>
   The firm represented John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. in
its agreement to sponsor Major League Baseball's FanFest at this
year's All-Star Game in Boston. It also brought baseball and Fleet
Financial Group together in a deal that made Fleet the first bank
to be a national sponsor of a sports league.
</P>
<P>
   Woolf brought EMC Corp., its biggest client, together with NBC
to produce and promote the EMC Golf Skills Challenge, a schedule of
35 events in the United States, including a televised finale, that
has helped to position EMC in its upscale demographic market. The
event has expanded to Europe, and Woolf is helping to organize a
version of the event in Asia. The events are part of the growth of
Woolf's golf division that Moulter calls one of the biggest
surprises of the first three years.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic summoned Woolf to New York two years ago to help
it develop a strategy to use sports and entertainment in its
marketing program. Bell Atlantic now sponsors the Atlantic 10
basketball championships and the former JVC Jazz Festival, which
occurs along the East Coast each summer. And Woolf's entertainment
division landed the marketing contract for the recent national tour
of The Wizard of Oz.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the firm's success is from helping corporations to do
what their marketing departments and consultants have little
experience doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it is that a corporate marketing department rarely
does that kind of work, whereas firms like Woolf are doing it all
of the time,'' said David D'Alessandro, president of John Hancock.
``But another part of it is that you have two really different
worlds here, the corporate culture and the sports culture _ and
they don't even speak the same language.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be surprised how often you need a sort of UN interpreter
to come in and just basically explain to one side what the other
side just said.''
</P>
<P>
   With the marketing and production side growing, Woolf continues
to be a major player in athlete representation.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Clifton, a super-agent who repesents major baseball stars,
including Billerica's Tom Glavine, the Cy Young Award-winning
pitcher for the Atlanta Braves, has stayed with the firm from the
Bob Woolf era. Clifton's reputation is so sound and far-flung that
it regularly helps Woolf attract top talent. Last year Woolf signed
four of the first 25 picks in the Major League Baseball draft _
more than any other agency.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, bringing in Orr and top hockey agent Jay Fee has
solidified Woolf's representation of professional hockey players.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Bobby Orr talks, I am sure kids all across Canada and
elsewhere listen,'' said Bob Williams of the Burns Sports Celebrity
Service in Chicago, which has worked with Woolf to develop
endorsement deals for players. ``Woolf has been increasingly
aggressive in recent years in the area of athlete representation.''
</P>
<P>
   But a recent attempt to expand the player representation portion
of the business was a huge failure. Last December, Moulter could
hardly contain himself when he talked about a prospective client
whom he hoped to announce after the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hear the name, you're going to know immediately how
big this is,'' Moulter told a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   The name was Ricky Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The Heisman Trophy winner from the University of Texas is such
an attractive athlete that the New Orleans Saints traded all of
their draft choices this year to position themselves earlier in the
draft to pick Williams.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, he seemed a perfect addition to Woolf. Williams
also played baseball, and Woolf represented him in his deal with
the Philadelphia Phillies. So it was no surprise when Woolf signed
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   It was a shock a few weeks later when Williams walked away from
Woolf amid public recriminations _ and private comments about how
both sides had conducted themselves _ to sign with No Limit Sports,
owned by the hip-hop recording artists known as Master P.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Woolf lost a nascent football operation under
agent Andrew Brandt, who says he considered following Williams to
No Limit before joining management at the Green Bay Packers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our biggest disappointment to date,'' Moulter
acknowledged. ``Ricky would have been a real strategic move for us.
I think because we are sports people and we are agents, we held out
sort of a romantic notion of football being more of an opportunity
for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought that using Ricky smartly, we could build a foothold
in football,'' he said. ``We're just not built at the moment to do
football the way these kids want to do football.''
</P>
<P>
   Moulter's view of Larry King's departure is more benign. He
believes that King, with a new wife and family, was simply
interested in moving his operations entirely to the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   But that has engendered a dispute over the fee he was paying to
Woolf, which is now to be settled as part of a court case in
Virginia, where King will be deposed this month.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the two disappointments, Moulter, looking at the
operation as a whole, says Woolf is well-positioned for more
growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old era, we were a sports company,'' Moulter said. ``In
the next era, I want us to be a smart company.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Moulter and Eskandarian are talking about significant
growth through the acquisition of other firms. They do not mention
names, but they are currently looking at a golf company and an
athletes' representation firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to be a Top 10 company in this business,''
Eskandarian said. ``And we think over the next 10 years, we'll be
there.''

FIDELITY'S UNASSUMING HEIR 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- It was not something that the Boston billionaire _
private, modest, almost Puritan in her bearing _ was eager to do.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the evening, Abigail Pierrepont Johnson had taken a
rare step into the spotlight, making an investment speech to junior
staffers at a Fidelity Investments dinner in Dallas. Now, amid
strains of country music, her colleagues wanted her to take part in
a Texas line dance.
</P>
<P>
   Reluctantly, Johnson put aside her Brahmin reserve and joined in
the fun.
</P>
<P>
   At Fidelity, the world's biggest mutual fund company, Johnson is
pondering more significant strides. More than two years after she
moved into the top ranks of the firm her grandfather founded half a
century ago, Johnson is quietly exploring whether she has the
mettle and the desire to run the company.
</P>
<P>
   To many observers, Johnson's role at the Boston institution her
father has led for 27 years portends the rise of Fidelity's
favorite child to the firm's helm. But Abby, as she is known, has
not decided whether she will preside over the company, say
colleagues and observers. Ultimately, Johnson, 37, may break family
tradition and reject Fidelity's throne.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think she has made up her mind which way she's going
to go yet,'' said James C. Curvey, Fidelity's chief operating
officer and the firm's number-two executive. Curvey is a confidant
of Edward C. ``Ned'' Johnson III, Fidelity's chairman and Abby's
father.
</P>
<P>
   In financial circles, questions about Fidelity's future
leadership are one of the money world's great parlor games.
Ordinary investors may never have heard of Abby Johnson, but
millions hold Fidelity funds and have staked their financial
well-being on the firm. And in Boston, where the company employs
tens of thousands, the decisions made at Fidelity's Devonshire
Street headquarters play a crucial role in fueling the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom holds that the chairman's oldest daughter
will succeed her father as head of the lucrative empire, which
routinely moves Wall Street and controls the fate of a significant
portion of America's savings and investments. But increasingly,
some industry observers say Johnson may prefer a junior role and
more time with her family to the hurly-burly of the hot seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job is hers for the asking,'' said Eric M. Kobren, a
private money manager in Wellesley and a former Fidelity marketing
executive who publishes an independent newsletter, Fidelity
Insight. ``But I don't think she wants to run the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately held Fidelity admits that it has a succession plan.
But the reclusive Johnson clan, a wealthy Boston family, is not
showing its cards.
</P>
<P>
   At a rare meeting over lunch with a reporter, Johnson skirted
questions about her future and insisted that most of the discussion
be off the record. But she made it clear that the top post should
be earned, not merely inherited.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't serve anyone to do anything that wasn't in the
best interests of the company,'' she said over zucchini soup in a
private dining room at Fidelity. ``We have to do what is in the
mutual fund shareholder's best interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who drives a forest-green Ford Explorer to work and
shops for her children's clothes on the Internet, affectionately
refers to Fidelity as ``co.'' Reed-thin and attired in an
unassuming, moss-colored suit, she peppered her conversation about
the investment business with the word ``like.''
</P>
<P>
   Affable and vibrant, yet cautious and introspective, she is
regarded as bright, diligent, and studious, according to
colleagues. Insiders say she has much of her father's insatiable
inquisitiveness and little of his notorious impatience. The two
meet once a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work here because I want to, not because people think I have
to,'' she said. ``I definitely want to continue to have a role at
Fidelity.''
</P>
<P>
   In one important way, she already controls the company. For four
years she has been the private firm's largest shareholder, with a
24.5 percent stake in the voting stock of FMR Corp., Fidelity's
parent. The holding, worth up to $9 billion by some recent
estimates, makes her one of the investing world's most powerful
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson sees more than personal wealth at stake as she
ponders her future. Some 15 million Americans own Fidelity mutual
funds, the investment vehicles that finance college educations and
homes. The firm is also the nation's top provider of individual
retirement plans, the portfolios on which many investors will rely
as they age. Overseeing nearly $1 trillion in assets, Fidelity is a
kind of public trust _ a responsibility, and a challenge, that
company insiders say both father and daughter feel all too keenly.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Ned Johnson, 69, shows no signs of retiring soon. If
he does as his father did, he will not relinquish the reins for
another decade _ long enough for his daughter's two children, ages
4 and 1, to grow up and exert less of a pull.
</P>
<P>
   But Abby Johnson, who lives in suburban Milton in a
Colonial-style house with her husband, Christopher McKown, the
cofounder of a health-care services information company, feels
other pressures, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like many women, she is juggling career and motherhood,'' said
A. Michael Lipper, whose firm, Lipper Inc., follows the fund
industry. ``She wants to be home more.'' A telling sign of the dual
world she inhabits is her workaday brown leather organizer, which
her oldest child, Julia, covered in stickers depicting a ladybug
and a cricket reading a book. She is also active in charities,
though she recently turned down a United Way request to become more
involved.
</P>
<P>
   If she becomes the third generation to run Fidelity, Johnson
will inherit a vastly changed _ and changing _ company. When her
father took over Fidelity in 1972, 26 years after his father,
Edward C. Johnson II, founded the firm, Fidelity had $3.9 billion
in assets, 17 mutual funds, and fewer than 200 employees. Mutual
funds had not yet become the investor's favored way into the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Fidelity has $857 billion in assets, 283 funds, and
nearly 28,500 staffers. Now a household name synonymous with a
democracy of investors, the behemoth has expanded to include a
discount stock brokerage, on-line trading services, and growing
overseas operations. Under Ned Johnson, Fidelity became a financial
giant, with 12 percent of the fund market, and funds replaced bank
accounts as America's savings haven.
</P>
<P>
   But Fidelity faces stiff competition and tectonic upheavals in
the investment industry. Private entities such as Goldman, Sachs,
the investment bank, and the New York Stock Exchange are going
public. Financial services firms are rapidly combining. Old ways of
doing business are changing, as alternative stock exchanges,
cyber-brokerages, and day-trading services sprout up.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the changes, questions naturally arise about Abby Johnson's
desire _ and ability _ to run the firm.

MAYORAL CANDIDATE IS A .COM UP ON OPPONENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARRY D. HATFIELD  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A new debate for the San Francisco mayoral race
is truly one for the age _ cybersquatting.
</P>
<P>
   Using a practice that Congress may make illegal, the mayoral
campaign of Clint Reilly has co-opted the Internet domain names
that may eventually have occurred to his opponents, Mayor Willie
Brown and former Mayor Frank Jordan, as good names for their own
campaign sites on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly's Web contractor, Andrew W. Hasse, owns, for example such
domain names as williebrown.com, williebrownjr.com, frankjordan.com
and jordanformayor.com.
</P>
<P>
   Hasse, who says he bought the domain names before he was hired
by Reilly, also owns damayor.com and williesucks.com.
</P>
<P>
   Hasse's companies registered those and other domain names in
February for $70 each.
</P>
<P>
   Once purchased through a central registry, domain names cannot
be used by anyone else, even if they are not being used on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Brown's supporters are crying foul.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Alice B. Toklas Lesbian and Gay
Democratic Club, which has close ties to Brown, said they may file
a complaint with the city Ethics Commission, although it wasn't
clear what the violation would be beyond bad manners.
</P>
<P>
   Brown campaign spokesman P.J. Johnston had a tempered reaction:
``It certainly is annoying but I don't think it's going to
seriously derail our campaign efforts in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Brown might complain to the ethics panel, Johnston
added, ``I don't know that the campaign is going to take any action
on this. The Toklas members first discovered this and were more
than a little annoyed by these basically mean-spirited shenanigans.
That's their perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   But Reilly's people say Brown is just not keeping up with the
times.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Tom Pier said Reilly's campaign hired Hasse in the
first place because he had registered Reilly's domain name _
clintreilly.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an unusual marketing technique for him,'' Pier said of
Hasse's ploy, ``but it seems to have worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what this shows is that Willie Brown is way behind the
curve on technology and technology issues. The fact that he was
unaware that his own name had been registered by someone else as
close as three months before election day is evidence that he
places no premium on the Internet as a means of communication.''
</P>
<P>
   Pier pointed to recent reports that San Francisco ranks 22nd in
the nation among major cities, ``behind cities like Albuquerque for
Web-savvy government.''
</P>
<P>
   Other cities allow such things as paying parking tickets and
other routine government functions on the Internet while ``San
Francisco ranks at the bottom of major American cities on
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate unanimously passed a bill last week that would limit
cybersquatting; the House is expected to follow suit. That
legislation would sharply curtail the lucrative practice of
registering Web addresses against the future promise of profiting
from them by selling them back to the people or companies whose
names were grabbed.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, however, the practice is legal.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Reilly campaign would consider selling back their
names to Brown or Jordan, Pier said, ``We haven't been asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston said Brown's Web site would be up and running by the
end of the week ``but not under any of the names Clint Reilly has
purchased.''
</P>
<P>
   No one with the Jordan campaign was available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Hasse, who did not return a telephone call seeking comment, also
took sites that Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano might
have wanted had he decided to run for mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm bemused,'' said Ammiano, who is not running for mayor. ``I
have one response _ getoveryourself.com.''

   TAKE-BOS  
 BOSTON: ... run the firm.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Lowell, who used to work at Fidelity and now publishes the
independent Fidelity Investor newsletter, thinks the chairman's
daughter will ultimately run the firm. But he said that while
Johnson ``had shown she could manage money capably, she still must
prove where her strengths lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father faced similar doubts when he inherited the mantle at
age 42 after 15 years as a successful Fidelity money manager and
analyst. Ned Johnson slowly immersed himself in the firm, delving
into marketing, technology, and popularizing money market funds. By
contrast, his daughter has concentrated on the investment side of
the business, and only recently showed an interest in the firm's
venture capital work.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is not preparing herself in the way Ned did,'' said
Lipper.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, when she moved into Fidelity's top ranks after nine
years as a fund manager and research analyst and first sparked talk
that Fidelity was grooming her for the throne, Abby Johnson has won
respect and gained confidence, associates and observers say. In the
rough-and-tumble world of money management, where bravado and
brashness are prized qualities and hubris is everywhere, hers is
not an easy achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abby has the work ethic, she has the intelligence, and she has
the judgment,'' observed Robert C. Pozen, a senior Fidelity
executive who oversees the firm's core fund operations and who is
Johnson's immediate boss. ``She's not a big mouth or a prima donna,
and she's not trying to blow her own horn. She has rolled up her
sleeves and really done the work.''
</P>
<P>
   As to her future, he said, ``I'm not going to speculate.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman's daughter, a senior vice president, is one of
three top executives _ the others are Richard A. Spillane and
Robert A. Lawrence _ who oversee Fidelity's 56 stock fund managers.
As coordinator for the Growth and Capital Appreciation groups, she
makes sure fund managers get the industry and company research they
need and that the right people are running the right funds. She
also sits in quarterly performance reviews. Some of Fidelity's
largest portfolios, including Magellan, the world's biggest fund,
are in her group. One of only six people on Fidelity's board of
directors, she also oversees a major project to reconfigure
computer systems for fund managers.
</P>
<P>
   Attentive to detail and constantly worried about how Fidelity
funds are performing, Johnson is a den mother to a flock of
nerve-wracked stock pickers. She recently helped one burned-out
money manager join the firm's charitable foundation, and guided her
through the transition.
</P>
<P>
   That softer approach contrasts with her father's formidable
leadership _ a trait on display when he shook up Fidelity's
management three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about falling fund returns and portfolio manager
defections, the chairman put into place a new structure,
establishing new senior positions and dispersing power among
executives. The changes elevated Pozen, who had been Fidelity's
chief lawyer, to head of fund operations. One year later, Abby
Johnson was promoted to Fidelity's inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   While the shifts were regarded as Ned Johnson's response to
Fidelity's embarrassing problems, they may also have been designed
to build a support structure around the chairman's daughter as she
ascended into the upper ranks.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ivan Lansberg, a Hew Haven-based specialist who
advises family-run companies, the changes may reflect the
chairman's sense that Fidelity needs more than one leader in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abby's well supported _ there's a cushion around her,'' said
one of the former Fidelity executives. ``They're not going to let
her be out there alone. The management committee treats her like a
daughter.'' Some observers say Fidelity downplays Abby Johnson to
avoid creating the image of a power struggle with Pozen, whose star
has risen. Pozen is Fidelity's de facto spokesman and is viewed by
some as better suited to ultimately lead Fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has not always followed in her father's footsteps.
Displaying her father's love of art but avoiding his alma mater,
Harvard, she graduated with a major in art history and a minor in
economics from William Smith College in Geneva, N.Y., in 1984, then
spent two years as a researcher at consulting firm Booz-Allen &AMP;
Hamilton in New York. After finishing Harvard Business School in
1988, she joined Fidelity as an analyst, covering the
industrial-equipment industry and training under legendary
stockpicker Peter Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   She spent three years managing three smaller stock funds,
producing strong returns. But Johnson was destined for more.
</P>
<P>
   She took over Trend, a $1.3 billion stock fund that her father
ran to great success in the early 1960s. Observers whispered that
she was being groomed for the top slot.
</P>
<P>
   She spent less than a year on the portfolio, producing only
modest gains. In her hands, Trend rose 7.92 percent, compared with
an average 10.11 percent for its peers, according to Morningstar, a
fund tracking firm. When she was promoted to the upper ranks, some
observers said that her name carried more weight than her
investment prowess.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity will avoid one common problem at family-run firms:
internecine warfare for the top slot. Johnson's sister, Elizabeth,
36, has shown no interest in a career at Fidelity, while her
brother, Edward C. Johnson IV, 34, works in a junior position in
the firm's real-estate unit.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there could be many futures in Fidelity's cards.
</P>
<P>
   One scenario involves the chairman's daughter staying at
Fidelity _ but not in the top job. ``Increasingly, we're seeing
family members retain a major ownership position without having a
key operating role,'' said Paul Karofsky, executive director of
Northeastern University's Center for Family Business.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another possibility is for Fidelity to go public.
</P>
<P>
   When Ned Johnson increased his daughter's stake in 1995 and
reduced his to 13 percent, putatively for estate planning, he also
distributed 51 percent to Fidelity's top 50 executives and money
managers. Eager to cash in, that group could clamor for the firm to
issue publicly traded stock. Another route would be for Fidelity to
sell itself to another financial services giant _ an option that
both Johnsons are thought to dislike, according to a company
insider.
</P>
<P>
   So will Abby Johnson run Fidelity?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ned Johnson would love for Abby to take the job,'' said one
Fidelity executive who declined to be named. ``But he also really
wants to see her happy.''
</P>
<P>
   While the chairman's daughter's reply to that question is as
enigmatic as the pyramid in Fidelity's logo, it suggests that the
decision is hers to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want,'' she said, ``to do whatever is best for the
company.''

 By ALISON ARNETT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON -- Americans are monolithic about cuisines from foreign
lands. Decades ago, we went to Chinese restaurants, trying out
wonton soup and Peking duck and dun dun noodles. But, we insisted
imperiously, we don't want it so hot, we don't like the salty _ and
we want knives and forks. The Chinese restaurateurs most obligingly
complied. Then we sniffed, Chinese food is too much alike. And
besides, chop suey isn't even Chinese; it's just made up for timid
American tastes.
</P>
<P>
   So we moved on. The food of Thailand _ with its appealing looks,
its exotica, its sweetness _ became popular, and Thai restaurants
suddenly appeared on every city corner and in every suburb. But
then we customers wanted not so hot, not too odd, more chicken, not
so much pork. Knives and forks weren't an issue, since chopsticks
are rarely used in Thailand, but we fussed about every spice, every
flavor that seemed challenging.
</P>
<P>
   And now too many Thai restaurants seem like cookie-cutter
operations, as though their big pale yellow menus listing
``fisherman's delight,'' ``shrimp in love,'' and ``duck choochee''
had been printed up en masse. Sometimes the restaurateurs seem to
have kept only the most obvious Thai ingredients _ the ginger, the
fruit, the chili sauce _ doused everything in extra sugar, and
basically served us stir-fry that we could do at home.
</P>
<P>
   Again we wonder: ``Are we tasting authentic Thai dishes, or are
they homogenized for Americans?'' Ennui sets in and we search out a
new thrill, aiming for the newer examples of regional Chinese
cuisine and other dishes of Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   There must be another way. With all these Thai restaurants
around, shouldn't we be able to have great Thai food without a long
plane flight? The appeal of Thai food is no surprise. After all, a
basic precept of Thai culture is ``sanuk,'' or fun, and the meals
are centered around that concept. The straightforwardness of the
dishes, most of them quickly cooked, is balanced by subtleties of
flavors and textures. Thai food relies on a balance among sweet,
salty, and sour, says Suraphong Pinyochon, chef and co-owner of
Brown Sugar Cafe, a fine and innovative Thai restaurant in the
Fenway. That balance, encompassing the main ingredients along with
galanga, lemongrass, chilies, basil, and very fresh herbs, can make
a dish seem ethereal. If one of those elements is off or missing,
the dish might fail.
</P>
<P>
   What I notice most in too many Thai dishes is sweetness, an
almost unpleasant preponderance of it, as though the ubiquitous pad
thai was a dessert topped with bean sprouts or the green curry a
liquid coconut cake. Arun Sampanthavivat of the famed Arun's in
Chicago finds that tendency distressing, along with the uniformity
of Thai restaurants in the United States. ``The sweetness is
exaggerated because (the restaurateurs) think Americans like it
sweet,'' Sampanthavivat says. ``Certainly the dishes can have a
hint,'' but too much and the dish is really not Thai. ``Green curry
should not be sweet at all.''
</P>
<P>
   He fears that Thai cuisine in America is ``losing its
integrity'' because restaurants try too hard to please clientele.
His solution at Arun's is to offer only tasting menus, so the wide
range of tastes and textures of the cuisine can be enjoyed, the
experience for the diner more under the control of the chef.
Sampanthavivat enlarges the definition of Thai balance, adding
savory or rich, spicy, and bitter to the range of Thai flavors.
After 14 years in business, he finds customers coming to Arun's
eager to taste the panoply of Thai food. Properly introduced,
Sampanthavivat says, Americans are quite receptive to the concepts.
</P>
<P>
   At Brown Sugar Cafe, Pinyochon and his partner, Suriyant (Toy)
Jamdee, stress the importance of buying fresh kaffir lime leaves,
galanga, and other ingredients, although they're more expensive
than the dried varieties. Pinyochon, who says he learned to cook
``from my mom,'' uses tamarind pulp and lemon juice to introduce
the sour element, rather than vinegar, as some restaurants do. And
although dried shrimp and fish sauce are sometimes more challenging
for customers, he finds that adding them slowly to the repertory
works.
</P>
<P>
   Brown Sugar's menu, created by Pinyochon, lists many of the
dishes common to Thai restaurants, from pad thai to salmon choo
chee. But the daily specials offer more unusual items, such as
stuffed omelettes, a crepelike creation filled with seafood or meat
and lots of vegetables; country-style pad thai; and Pinyochon's own
creations, using the best local, seasonal ingredients. One evening,
I enjoyed poo pad pong garee, a subtle mix of soft-shell crabs and
hard-shell crab claws, along with shrimp and vegetables in a light
green curry sauce. There were many layers to the dish, from the
natural sweetness of the crabs to just a hint of spiciness in the
curry. Bits of fried garlic on top gave crunch, and a profusion of
coriander added herbal lilt.
</P>
<P>
   Both owners came to the United States to study for MBA degrees.
Three years ago, they decided to open a cafe rather than return
home because of the depressed state of Thailand's economy. They
opened in the neighborhood where they live with their wives and
children. ``By the time we opened, there were many other Thai
restaurants around, so we knew we had to do something different,''
Jamdee says. Instead of concentrating on a set Thai menu, Pinyochon
worked to push the envelope, introducing dishes that match the
seasons and what is available in the markets. ``My mom when she
visits says my food is not quite Thai style,'' he says with a
laugh. But their clientele, much of it from the surrounding
neighborhood, is becoming more adventuresome, the two say. Of
course, they happily adjust the spiciness of a dish. Thai food can
be ``way hot,'' they say, laughing when asked if it compares with
the spiciness of Indian or Malaysian cuisines.
</P>
<P>
   Many regional dishes of Thailand _ Pinyochon is from Bangkok and
Jamdee from the northeast, near Cambodia _ are served at Brown
Sugar. Nina Simonds, author of Chinese and Asian cookbooks, says
that the American experience ``has generalized Thai cooking. When
you go to Thailand, there are all these regional differences that
you don't find here.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex Jitmaitre, whose family owns three Bangkok restaurants and
who now cooks for Jae's Cafe in the Atrium in Chestnut Hill, thinks
that the variety of Thai flavors works well in restaurants like
Jae's, with a pan-Asian menu in its four locations.
</P>
<P>
   Sampanthavivat of Chicago says the cross-cultural influences
have always been strong in Thai cuisine, with China, Cambodia,
India, and Malaysia represented. It makes the cuisine wonderfully
flexible, he says, especially since the variety of dishes fits into
the Western style of appetizers, main course, and dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Arun's restaurant presents both classical cuisine and
innovations on the themes. ``Culture needs to blossom and branch
out,'' Sampanthavivat says, rather than becoming stagnant.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is the future for Thai cuisine, a reliance on the
classical dishes with a creative push into the new. As customers,
our mission seems clear: Coax your favorite Thai restaurant into
taking some chances. Tell the owner and the chefs you'll be brave
and try authentic classical flavors. March into your favorite Thai
restaurant and insist on what the kitchen staff eats at home. Be
proactive diners, and save a fabulous cuisine from homogenization.

FATHERS MAKE A MOVE TOWARD THE HOMESTEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Concerned about ruining their careers, most men do not reveal
family responsibilities at work. That's not true of Keith
Clinkscales, a self-described family man and father of three who is
up front about his work-family balancing act.
</P>
<P>
   So are Jeffrey Pina and Thomas McNaughton, both Cabot Corp.
employees, and Jim Kappel, a general manager at the Marriott Hotel
in Burlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Pina shares child-rearing and household chores with his wife.
McNaughton picks up his toddler from day care. Kappel attended
almost all of his daughter's lacrosse games last year. And
Clinkscales drops his children off at a day-care center and at
school, attends school programs, and cares for them when they're
sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of fathers are changing their work ethic,'' said
Clinkscales, 37, a management consultant whose wife is an engineer.
``Instead of being workaholics, they want more balance.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, some employers are starting to listen.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a tight labor market and high turnover rate, big
companies are trying harder to retain and attract talent.
</P>
<P>
   And for some, that includes reaching out to fathers. Experts say
corporate response to father-friendly programs should also increase
as Generation Xers begin coming of age in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   At Marriott International Inc., company officials have launched
a series of fatherhood seminars to help hourly wage earners at the
chain's hotels locate day care and support, to find ways to stay in
touch with children after divorce, and to handle child care when
the child's stay with Dad is temporary.
</P>
<P>
   For males, Marriott held a Daddy Stress course last year, and
developed a video to help male managers find ways to reconcile job
and family needs.

   Dallas-based Texas Instruments sent out an e-mail inviting
fathers to a so-called ``work-life'' seminar two years ago, and far
more men responded than it had expected. Stunned by the response,
Texas Instruments work-life manager Betty Purkey says she now
targets programs to men.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft offers a Dad's Initiative, a one-day workshop designed
to help fathers balance their lives. And NationsBank and Chase
Manhattan Bank have sponsored fatherhood courses taught by James
Levine, an expert on working fathers and a director of the
Fatherhood Project at the Families and Work Institute in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Even the military is getting involved: The US Marine Corps
recently offered a ``baby boot camp'' to new fathers who needed
help with parenting skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that there is a greater focus among younger
fathers on being more involved as a parent than their parents
were,'' said Texas Instrument's Purkey. ``They are more proactive .
. . This is a generation where there were a lot of broken marriages
and absentee fathers. So, they are probably saying, ``I don't want
that for my children.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Pittinsky, coauthor of ``Working Fathers: New Strategies
for Balancing Work and Family,' notes that when MBA students are
polled about job expectations, more men and women now say they
would rather work for a family-friendly company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on, men are factoring work-life concerns and family
needs into the job hunt and the job offer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Pina didn't pay much attention to the offers he received
last year until Cabot Corp., a worldwide chemical company
headquartered in Boston, offered him a job in its communications
department. Pina says he was attracted to the firm's flex-time
policy and its interest in his wife and three children.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got the offer from Cabot back in January or February,
the company took me out to dinner and called my wife, invited her,
and asked her to choose the place,'' said Pina, 40, of Hyde Park.
``I thought that was cool. People at Cabot seemed to understand
that you can't do a good job if things aren't right at home. Most
companies don't even care whether you have a family.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts reason that as wives have flooded the workplace,
husbands have had to take on responsibility at home while finding
ways to put in work hours. For some, that has meant leaving to pick
up junior and then returning after hours, or logging on to a home
computer at 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Michael F. Carter, vice president of the Philadelphia-based Hay
Group, a worldwide human resources management and consulting firm,
notes that success is still measured by the amount of time
employees log and the amount of work they do.
</P>
<P>
   Carter admits that an increase in the number of baby boomers in
management has led to more father-friendly policies, primarily
because most have working wives and their own family demands.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, he said, ``There is still a certain amount
of schizophrenia going on in the workplace. Family-friendly
policies may be part of company policy, but it still works out that
the person who is up for the promotion is often the one who gives
more time to his work _ to the detriment of his family.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1997 survey by the Families and Work Institute,
American men are spending 2.1 hours a day on household chores,
compared with 1.2 hours 20 years ago. They are also spending more
of their work day on child care, up to 2.3 hours per day, compared
with 30 minutes in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Tom McNaughton, 39, of Andover, director of investor relations
at Cabot, says being a father has been a consuming and
life-changing experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I split things right down the middle, which means
we are always adjusting.'' His wife, a partner at DeLoitte &AMP;
Touche, also puts in long hours at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a number of times when I've picked up my
daughter at day care,'' McNaughton said. ``I let the key people at
Cabot know that I couldn't be here until 5. They trusted that I
would get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting the job done can mean putting in as many as 70 hours a
week. ``I do more work later in the evening that I ever did
before,'' he said. ``If I need to change my schedule, then I pretty
much can do it up front, because there is greater flexibility
around how I do my work.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many family-minded men face enormous pressures at work.
Some of the stress is caused by the work environment; some stems
from fear. One executive at a top investment firm recalled being
asked to attend late-night meetings, even though the company knew
he had made plans to be with his children.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't say no,'' he said. ``The attitude was either
handle it, or be labeled as someone who wasn't a team player. Was
it stressful? Absolutely. I missed a lot of my son's baseball
games, many of my daughter's recitals, and other events that were
important to me and them.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, research suggests that family-minded men earn
up to $2,000 more a year than those who do not consider family
relationships a priority.
</P>
<P>
   One study, by a Williams College economist, Jill Constantine,
found that among 18-year-old men in a 1972 US Department of
Education survey, those who showed a particular interest in family
and marriage grew up to be successful middle-aged adults.
Constantine reasoned that these men may have demonstrated a higher
ability to make relationships work, both in their families and on
the job.
</P>
<P>
   Two other studies of the earnings of family-minded men,
conducted at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and at
the University of Illinois, resulted in similar findings.
</P>
<P>
   All three studies were based on federal information, and on
interviews of about 3,000 men and women who were surveyed in 1972
and contacted again in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many men now want the flexibility to take care of their
personal lives. Companies are finally paying attention to that,''
said Jeffrey Saltzman, president of Sirota Consulting, industrial
psychologists and management consultants, in Purchase, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But Saltzman said, ``The truth is, success still centers around
the person whose life is work.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I may leave at 3 p.m. to pick up Johnny, but I'm also back
at work after dinner when the kids are asleep. I'm in the home
office, I'm on my PC. True, fathers are getting more flexibility
from the progressive firms, but performance expectations are just
as high as they ever were.''

CHANCELLOR LOOKING FOR A NEW LEASE ON TRADING LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In baseball, the minor leagues are sprinkled with players who
once held major league jobs, and would love nothing more than
another chance to make it back to the show.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out the stock market is no different. Companies who get
dumped by one of the major stock exchanges because of financial
problems get relegated to something called the OTC Bulletin Board,
the market's equivalent of the minor leagues. There they try to
work out the kinks in their game, dreaming of the day they make it
back to the big time.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Corp., a Boston company in the leasing business, fits
this description. And as the company's recent experience shows, the
comeback trail is not an easy one.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor recently said it expects to report its seventh
consecutive profitable quarter and put up its best numbers in a
decade. Its stock, which had been trading at about 50 cents a
share, promptly went up to about 75 cents. By Tuesday it was down
to about 50 cents again.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people won't touch these stocks,'' says Harry
Eisenberg, publisher of Walker's Manual in Lafayette, Calif., which
tracks unlisted stocks. ``The average investor wants to be able to
check the price of his stocks in the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   About 6,700 stocks are listed on the Bulletin Board, a loosely
regulated electronic trade and quote system. Some of he stocks
almost never trade and the companies don't even bother to report
earnings on a regular basis. Others, like Chancellor, file all the
reports a normal publicly-traded company would. They are on the
Bulletin Board because they don't meet the financial requirements
the major exchanges demand.
</P>
<P>
   In Chancellor's case, the company would have to get its stock
price up to $3 per share before it could be considered for listing
on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor once had a respectable major league career. The
company made money from its founding in 1977 until about the
mid-1980s. Over the next ten years, however, Chancellor managed to
lose roughly $250 million. ``The company didn't keep up with
changes in the transportation market,'' says Peter Mullen, a
Chancellor vice president. Chancellor leases tractor-trailers to
corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
   The firm lost its Nasdaq listing in 1994. The next year Vestex
Capital Corp, a private investment company, bought out the old
ownership. Beginning in 1997 the new team began to show results.
Sales climbed from $4 million in 1997 to $29 million last year and
to $29 million for the first six months of 1999. Losses have been
replaced by profits _ an expected $400,000 in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The growth has been fueled largely by acquisition, and with the
new additions has come a new strategy. Typically in the leasing
business, a company leases a truck for a certain period of time.
When the lease expires the company turns the truck over to a
wholesaler who, in turns, resells it.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor plans to do things differently. By acquiring its own
truck selling business, it hopes to eliminate the wholesaler from
the operation, and handle the resales itself. ``We can save a lot
of money that way which allows us to be more aggressive in setting
lease prices,'' says Frank Churchill, Chancellor's president.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill, a 40-year veteran of the leasing business, says the
pricing advantage will translate into more deals and ultimately
more profits down the road.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to check that prediction with an analyst or an
institution that owns the stock. Unfortunately, there aren't any
for stocks listed on the Bulletin Board. ``In this world you are
out of the normal channels of interest,'' says Eisenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenberg is not familiar with Chancellor, but after looking at
the company's financial reports, he points out that the company has
a very small net worth and a high level of debt. Mullen doesn't
dispute that, but says Chancellor's numbers are all moving in the
right direction.
</P>
<P>
   Can Chancellor make it back to the show? It's hard to say. It's
also hard to stage a comeback when no one is paying attention.
Imagine hitting a home run in a stadium with no fans and you have
some idea the situation Chancellor is in.
</P>
<P>
   Mullen doesn't sound worried. ``We've only been telling our
story for a little while,'' he says. ``People are only starting to
wake up to us.''

BUSH HAS AN OFFER SOME GOP CONTENDERS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REFUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We are now in the leveraged buyout stage of the Republican
campaign for president, with the shadowy brain trust of Texas
Governor George W. Bush using its financial muscle to shove
vulnerable rivals out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Putting your competition out of business is a time-honored
tactic. And the Bush operation, which amassed a colossal war chest
of $36 million in six months, is dangling dollar signs in front of
aides to competing candidates. Quit now, goes the pitch; fold up
and go home, and we'll arrange for your bills to be paid. But if
you stay in, if you knock Bush or make fun of ``compassionate
conservatism,'' or if you refuse to go quietly, we'll hold it
against you.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican straw poll this Saturday in Ames, Iowa, is one of
those essentially trivial events that loom larger than it should.
Because Bush is so far out in front in a crowded, double-digit
field, rivals who fare poorly in the $25-per-head straw poll beauty
contest will find it harder to raise money and hold on to
volunteers, staffers, and supporters they thought they'd already
convinced.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates like Lamar Alexander, who once boasted of the
strongest on-the-ground organization in Iowa, and former vice
president Dan Quayle, struggling to stay relevant in New Hampshire
as well as Iowa, could get squeezed down the food chain. Bush is
running number one in Iowa this week, and Steve Forbes, who is
spending buckets full of cash from his private fortune, is thought
to be running second by Iowa handicappers.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of a window opening after the Ames event through
which to defenestrate some of the opposition, the Bush operatives
are discreetly dangling invitations to quit that have the distinct
whiff of a bribe. It's all perfectly legal.
</P>
<P>
   The pitch goes like this: We know you're hurting. Your money is
drying up because we're so far out in front. Your campaign is
running on fumes. If you don't show something in Iowa, that hurts
you in New Hampshire. And after New Hampshire's opening primary,
when the big state primaries come fast and furious, requiring
millions in TV and travel costs, you're dead.
</P>
<P>
   But if you quit the race now and say something nice about George
W., we'll ease your pain. Remember, goes the pitch: One Bush was
president of the United States and leader of the Republican Party.
Another is governor of Texas. A third is governor of Florida. Any
one of those can (itals)hurt(unitals) you, now or down the road.
And if by some chance (itals)your(unitals) candidate managed to win
the nomination, there's no way your guy (or gal) could win the
White House without the active support of the governors of Texas
and Florida, the Sun Belt bookends whose electoral votes are
essential to victorious Republican campaigns. So think about it.
</P>
<P>
   It's a compelling argument. One presumes, from the outside, that
this argument, or one closely approximate to it, was what persuaded
US Representative John Kasich of Ohio to abort his long-shot effort
and show up at a news conference with a Bush cap and a ringing
speech about why Bush will be a great president.
</P>
<P>
   How does the Bush campaign divert cash to the coffers of a
hard-up also-ran who's going nowhere fast? Easy. Bush has already
maxed out with thousands of contributors who gave him the $1,000
limit. But it's strictly legal for those same Bush donors to write
another $1,000 check to soon-to-be ex-candidate Joe Blow.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that check won't be mailed till the high command in
Texas winks and blinks and lets the contributor know that he or she
will get credit with the Bush operation for facilitating George
W.'s path to the White House by essentially paying off the
accumulated debt of Joe Blow's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It's not all nicely-nicely, of course. There's always some bad
blood, hard feelings, and swallowing of pride and gall when it
comes to folding your campaign and going quietly. To the pros, the
consultants, the pollsters, and the money people, it's only a
seasonal defeat. Your team didn't make the playoffs, but you can
maybe hook on with the winners in some fashion. It's only politics,
right?
</P>
<P>
   To the candidates, personally, the decision to fold is a bitter
pill. No one enters the candidate's line of work who doesn't, in
that heart of hearts, think there's at least a chance that
lightning will strike. Look at how people buy lottery tickets. It
is the job of the professional handlers to offer sage counsel to
the candidate, to explain the implications of staying in and waging
a costly and ultimately losing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   If you quit and make peace with the Bush crowd, you get a better
hotel assignment for the Philadelphia convention, maybe a
prime-time speaking slot, and a plush job if Bush gets in. If you
go without a fuss, the Bush camp can make life easier for you,
giving some of your key people campaign salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Quit without taking any federal matching funds, they croon, and
you can save yourself the expense of a $200,000 mandatory audit of
how you spent the taxpayers' money. These are the types of
decisions that the also-rans in the Iowa straw poll will wrestle
with next week and the week after. Jim Baker, campaign manager for
Bush the Elder in a losing 1980 bid against Ronald Reagan, used to
quote the country music classic of the gambler's lament: ``You
gotta know when to hold 'em and know when to fold 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   For some Iowa straw poll losers, that time may be at hand.

HALF THE STORY ON WELFARE REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week the White House laid it on as sweet and thick as
molasses on the triumphs of welfare reform. In Chicago, where he
announced that all 50 states and the District of Columbia have met
requirements for putting certain percentages of welfare recipients
to work, President Clinton said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you see the signs of transformation everywhere: . . .
Buses that used to be empty at rush hour are packed . . . mothers
collecting their mail with a little more pride because they know
they'll see a bank statement, not a welfare check; children going
to school with their heads a little higher.''
</P>
<P>
   In another speech, Vice President Gore boasted how the federal
government has put 14,000 welfare recipients to work, surpassing
the goal of 10,000. At all such speeches, the White House trots out
cheerful former recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Askew, who has moved from welfare to a job in the White
House mail room, said: ``It's like a wonderful heaven has been
opened, and blessings flowed out. For me, it's something I always
wanted _ a stable job.''
</P>
<P>
   There would be nothing wrong with all this in the abstract. The
nation has cut the welfare rolls in half since 1993, from 14.1
million to 7.3 million. The percentage of Americans on welfare,
2.7, is the lowest percentage in three decades, when it was 2.5
percent during the Johnson administration.
</P>
<P>
   But when Clinton urged more businesses to hire more welfare
recipients by saying they ``are good for the bottom line,'' he
invited an obvious contradiction. Welfare recipients may be good
for a company's bottom line, but three years after welfare reform
slashed and burned its way through the rolls, there is still scant
evidence that recipients are lifting themselves off the bottom. For
many, molasses is a morass.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of mothers who left welfare between 1995 and 1997
released last week by the Urban Institute, a progressive think
tank, 71 percent stayed off welfare. Sixty-nine percent left for
higher earnings, and their employment rate was 61 percent. Of the
employed former recipients, 69 percent worked full time, and 25
percent more are working 20 to 35 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   But by and large the wages are still in the poverty zone. The
median hourly wage of employed former recipients is $6.61. Only 25
percent of them make more than $8 an hour, and 25 percent make less
than $5.29 an hour. The median annual earnings of $13,788 is about
the 1997 poverty level for a family of three.
</P>
<P>
   The study did not include any benefits from the earned-income
tax credit, but even with that, 39 percent of former recipients
said there was at least one month in the last year when they were
unable to pay rent, mortgage, or utlility bills. A third of former
recipients said they had to cut the size of meals or skip them
because there was not enough money, and 49 percent said they had
instances when food did not last to the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, with their entry into the working poor, 41 percent of
adults and 25 percent of children in the families of former
recipients now have no health insurance. Study author Pamela
Loprest wrote: ``It would not be surprising to most people that
recent welfare leavers are not doing as well economically as the
average worker. It is not clear if society expects the average
former recipient to ever attain this level.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Loprest continued, it is important to remember that
former recipients ``fit in at the low end of the labor market.
These mothers (as well as low-income women who have not recently
been on welfare) mainly work in low-wage occupations and
industries. More than a quarter work night schedules, and over half
are struggling with coordinating work schedules and child care.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, New York State released a study that said 66 percent
of recipients found work within a year after leaving the rolls, and
53 percent were still employed. But the average family income
(which could include the earnings of more than just the
ex-recipient) is estimated to be between $16,920 and $20,136 _ not
considered a living wage by many economists.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Massachusetts welfare officials released figures that
said 71 percent of families who responded to a survey earned an
average of $16,450 a year. The state said 59 percent were a little
better off or much better off than before, and virtually all their
children had some form of health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the survey said it covered a useless fraction of
the ex-recipients, as only a third of a randomly selected group of
647 cases responded to all four rounds of questions. The state has
cut 50,000 families from welfare since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Albelda, an economist at UMass-Boston, said the survey
measures only ``the best of the bunch.'' The best of the bunch is
being measured in the best economy in decades. Yet in
Massachusetts, as in the rest of the country, the average salary is
still in the poverty zone.
</P>
<P>
   The White House lays it on thick about seeing the poor swim.
What it does not discuss is the condition of the pool. Welfare
recipients would say it is hard to paddle in a vat of molasses.

METEOR SHOWER RETURNS FOR ANNUAL PERFORMANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ One of the year's brightest meteor showers
should reach peak intensity Thursday night and Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   On an ordinary night an observer might glimpse a bright meteor
every few hours, if at all. But during the Perseid shower ``you may
spot one every few minutes,'' said Alan MacRobert, associate editor
of Sky &AMP; Telescope, the Cambridge, Mass.-based astronomy magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The best viewing is likely early in the morning, when Earth will
have rotated directly into the path of the incoming meteors.
</P>
<P>
   Earth re-encounters the Perseid cloud of meteoric particles,
most smaller than grains of sand, about this time every year.
</P>
<P>
   This year's shower should be especially good because the moon
won't be around to illuminate the sky, Sky &AMP; Telescope says in its
August issue.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling at 37 miles per second, the meteors rapidly heat up
and turn incandescent. They get so hot that even a very tiny one
high in the sky, 50 to 80 miles up, can be easily seen from the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   The shower will appear to emanate from the direction of the
constellation Perseus, hence the name for the meteor shower. The
constellation is low in the north-northeastern sky late Thursday,
but rises higher in the northeast through the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Perseid meteors don't actually have any connection with the
constellation, though. It is purely coincidental that they lie in
the direction of the meteoric cloud.

   When the annual motorcycle instructional track day was held last
year, instructor Judy Mirro was struck by the gender disparity.
``We'd get about 45 men and two women,'' said Mirro, an
environmental engineer from Vermont who also works for BCM Motor
Sports in Laconia, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Thus evolved the first Ladies Track Day sponsored by BCM that
will be held Monday at New Hampshire International Speedway. After
a morning classroom session, the motorcycle riders go around the
15-turn, 1.6-mile course and are shown different riding and
cornering techniques by the instructors.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that women wouldn't be as intimitated on a track if
they were surrounded only by women riders, Mirro started planning
the day last November. By January, the 45 slots were filled, ``and
I could fill the track three times,'' she said. Mirro said after
the word was put out on the Internet and in motorcycle magazines,
``It spread like wildfire,'' and she heard from women in Florida,
Virginia, and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   There will be 12 instructors at the day, she said, and a
``handful'' of gentlemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it will no longer be `Judy and the guys,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than a year before the 2000 Olympics, Ben Smith will be
looking right past Sydney and ahead to 2002 and defense of the US
Olympic gold medal when the USA Hockey Women's Festival opens
Monday for a week of action in Lake Placid.
</P>
<P>
   ``This festival is a great opportunity for younger players to
gain valuable experience training with Olympians, and it is also
the first in a series of important steps as we begin to prepare for
Salt Lake City,'' said Smith, who led the US women's team to the
gold medal in Nagano and continues to coach the national team.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-two players, including 14 Olympians and many with New
England ties, have been invited to the festival. They are divided
into four teams of 18 players each, and participate in daily on-
and off-ice training sessions as well as a round-robin tournament
that ends with a championship game at 8 p.m. on Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Of the active Olympians, only Shelley Looney _ out with a broken
collarbone _ will be absent. Goaltenders Sarah Tueting and Sara
DeCosta; defensemen Angela Ruggiero, Sue Merz, Chris Bailey, and
Tara Mounsey; and forwards A.J. Mleczko, Laurie Baker, Katie King,
Tricia Dunn, Alana Blahoski, Jenny Schmidgall, Karyn Bye, and
Olympic captain Cammi Granato, all are expected.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the roster are veterans Erin Whitten and Stephanie
O'Sullivan. Both were among the final cuts made to the 1998 Olympic
team but returned to action in the World Championships last March
in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other players with a New England connection are
defensemen Brooke White of Northeastern; Jamie Hagerman, a Wenham
native out of Deerfield Academy who will play for national champion
Harvard this fall; Amy Coehlo from North Truro and a member of the
1999 national team; Nicki Luongo, out of Tyngsboro and the
University of New Hampshire; Val Bono from Woburn and Providence
College; and Courtney Kennedy, a Woburn native who plays for the
University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Forwards include Harvard's Angela Francisco; Kelly McManus, out
of Dedham and UNH; Kim Berry, from Haverill and Cushing Academy;
Ali Couglin, from Lincoln and Princeton; Tina Carrabba, Billerica
and UNH; Jessica Tabb, Holland and Providence College; Krissy
McManus, Dedham and Assabet Valley; Hilary Witt, Canton and
Northeastern; Brooke Whitney of Northeastern; and Erin Magee of
Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Goldstein, a Milton native who most recently played for
the Beatrice Aeros in Canada, will be among the goaltenders, while
Harvard coach Katey Stone will be assistant coach.

ESTABLISHING MUTUAL TRUST WOULD PAY OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ Let me get this straight. It's not about the
money; it's about keeping track of the money.
</P>
<P>
   Or try it this way: It's not the money; it's the principle of
the thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the heart of the issue,'' declared Tiger Woods.
``There's a lot of money being generated by the Ryder Cup, and we'd
like to have some say in how it's allocated.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one version of this Ryder Cup compensation brouhaha. But
just who exactly constitutes the ``we''?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become a media issue instead of a player issue,''
maintained Davis Love, who, like Tiger, will be a member of the
United States Ryder Cup squad that tees it up against the Europeans
46 days hence. ``If you (i.e. the media) keep asking the question,
you're going to keep getting answers. And it's really a nonissue,
except in the media room. It's not an issue in the locker room.
It's not an issue in our, within our, team. And it never really has
been.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiger or Davis? Which one do we believe?
</P>
<P>
   The answer would be Davis, if we listen to Jim Awtrey, the CEO
of PGA of America, and Tim Finchem, commissioner of the PGA. These
two had a meeting with 16 definite or possible Ryder Cup
participants Tuesday afternoon. According to them, there is
unanimity among the Ryder Cup set. They will happily play for the
token five grand. The darn media were just stirring up some trouble
again.
</P>
<P>
   About two hours earlier, Tiger certainly thought it was an
issue. He could be construed as being suspicious of the PGA, or
perhaps even resentful, because he clearly thought the Ryder Cup
has become a big enough monetary enterprise that the American
participants deserve more than the current nominal stipend of
$5,000 a man.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he could foresee a circumstance in which a player might
actually reject a Ryder Cup berth if the money situation were to
remain static, Tiger didn't shy away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I presume that to be a yes,'' he said, ``but I also
understand that what has to end up happening is that all of you
sitting here today have to understand what is going on in this golf
tournament, and when the press understands what is going on _ the
whole story, and not just one little part of it _ then I think that
if someone does opt not to play, I think we'll all have a better
understanding of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stop right here. We all know that Tiger does not need the money.
None of the people who will be on the team need the money, even if
they were to add two zeroes to the current total.
</P>
<P>
   So what is going on?
</P>
<P>
   If I've got this right, the players _ some of them, anyway _
feel manipulated. Since 1989, the Ryder Cup has gone from losing a
half-million dollars a whack to generating upwards of $63 million,
the predicted haul from this year's get-together at The Country
Club. It is no longer a simple gentleman's competition with our
friends from across the pond. It is very big business, and the
dissidents, anyway, feel they are being used to some extent. Just
throw me a bone, Tiger is saying, and I'll go away happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see us each get an amount _ whether it's
$200,000, $300,000, $400,000, $500,000, whatever it is _ and I
think we should be able to keep the money and do with it whatever
we see fit,'' Tiger said. ``For me, personally, I would donate all
of it to charity. I'm sure most everyone else would do the same.
With all the money that's being made, I think we should have a say
in where it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should get money to take back to our community,''
agreed David Duval. ``If I want to give some money back to a
children's soccer field in Ponte Vedra Beach, that should be my
choice. I don't want to speak for anyone else. I don't want $5
million, but I think we should have some money to take back to
benefit, you know, where we live. And if people see a problem with
that, I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   This is exactly what they said. There were hundreds of
witnesses. More importantly, there was a PGA-supplied stenographer
who got it all down for everyone to read.
</P>
<P>
   So what do we make of the following?
</P>
<P>
   ``Compensation is not an issue,'' insisted Awtrey. ``I'd like to
reaffirm that no player is interested in being paid for playing in
the Ryder Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one,'' echoed Finchem, ``is seeking or asking to be
compensated.''
</P>
<P>
   Did Woods and Duval, and Mark O'Meara, for that matter (he first
broached this topic in public more than six months ago), have a
dramatic and sudden change of heart? Did they just wimp out? Did
someone _ an agent, perhaps _ get to them and suggest that it was
rampant Ugly Americanism to introduce the topic of money into any
Ryder Cup dialogue? Or did they receive a winking assurance that
things will be worked out to their satisfaction before the Ryder
Cup of 2001?
</P>
<P>
   This is not one of the burning issues of our time. It's all
about multimillionaires kvetching. These are people who are used to
being consulted and placated. These are also people who have a
great defense mechanism that comes into play when they suspect they
are being used.
</P>
<P>
   And it's about trust. They don't have any. They hear that the
PGA is coming into $63 million and they immediately assume at least
some of it will disappear into Dom Perignon and getaway weekends at
secluded Caribbean resorts.
</P>
<P>
   Check out this Tigerism on the subject of the Ryder Cup: ``You
don't need all those blue blazers and all those corporate tents. If
that's the case, let the public come in for free.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't care what he didn't say behind those closed doors. What
he said with the notebooks open and the cameras whirring is what he
really believes.
</P>

LAWYER, PSYCHIATRIST OFFER NOVEL THEORIES IN COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchases by calling 212-556-4204 or -1927.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- They've teamed up at least three times, twice this
week alone, the flamboyant defense lawyer and the reserved,
introspective psychiatrist, peddling some of the most
unconventional reasons for why accused criminals did what they did.
</P>
<P>
   In one case argued Tuesday in federal court, the drug dealer
sold cocaine to a female undercover agent because he was powerless
in her miniskirted presence; in another, a man raised by a band of
Gypsies was genetically and environmentally programmed to lie and
steal.
</P>
<P>
   And on Monday, attorney John McBride and psychiatrist Keith
Ablow were together again, this time for the sentencing of a
Chelsea teenager involved in a fatal hit-and-run accident.
</P>
<P>
   Called by McBride as an expert witness, Ablow testified that the
19-year-old had a long family history of alcoholism that left
``three generations of biological and psychological loading on his
shoulders,'' and that he was not the murderous criminal the
victim's family said he was.
</P>
<P>
   It is increasingly common, of course, for lawyers to pay expert
witnesses to testify in court on their clients' behalf. And
McBride, who is well known in local legal circles, is quick to
point out that Ablow is not the only psychiatrist he employs as an
expert, just as Ablow notes that McBride is not the only attorney
who has hired him to provide testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But the unlikely duo has become a tag team of sorts in cases
advancing novel psychiatric defense strategies: McBride, the
colorful, rough-and-tumble lawyer whose high-profile clients have
included reputed Mafia figures and police officers charged with
corruption, and Ablow, the cerebral, goateed lawyer with the Ivy
League background.
</P>
<P>
   And while the theories may be unusual, they have proven
effective.
</P>
<P>
   In a case involving a man who had bilked numerous senior
citizens in a driveway-paving scheme, Ablow testified that the
man's Gypsy upbringing _ ``a culture for which deception and lying
is a survival strategy'' _ had contributed to his criminal
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Although the prosecutor in the case insists that the judge was
not swayed by Ablow's testimony _ which included references to
Dante, Kafka, and Vaclav Havel _ McBride's client ultimately
received three years in jail, considerably less than the six to
eight years recommended by the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   In the hit-and-run case, James Dean Abramofsky Jr. was sentenced
Monday to 3 1/2 years in jail, about a quarter of the time
prosecutors wanted.
</P>
<P>
   And in the drug-dealing case, a preliminary report on Ablow's
``knocked out by the knockout'' theory was submitted to Judge Nancy
Gertner, who, in her days as a defense lawyer, once argued that the
young man who bragged about planting a bomb that killed a Boston
police officer suffered from ``pseudologica fantastica,'' an
uncontrollable need to tell self-aggrandizing lies.
</P>
<P>
   Ablow contended in the drug-dealing case that the defendant had
spent his entire life trying to please women, largely due to an
overly close relationship with his mother and grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   And so, Ablow's theory goes, he was helpless when faced with a
highly attractive, provocatively dressed female informant who he
says ``made him feel like James Bond.''
</P>
<P>
   There are skeptics, of course, who dismiss Ablow's theories as
cockamamie psychobabble concocted by a paid-for-hire psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think judges have a right to entertain testimony from
so-called experts that might explain why people do what they did,''
said Mike Ulharik, the prosecutor who tried the Gypsy case, ``but
courts have to be careful to make sure this is not just an
unsubstantiated opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet McBride insists that Ablow has the skills, blue-chip
credentials, and just plain common sense to provide objective
psychiatric opinions in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can basically pay a medical expert to say essentially what
you want,'' conceded McBride, ``but Keith's not going to be like
that. I've asked him about certain cases where I couldn't use him
simply because he wouldn't be in the best interest of my client.''
</P>
<P>
   Added McBride: ``He knows what he's talking about. He's not a
hired gun and he's not a quack.''
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Brown University and Johns Hopkins Medical School,
Ablow, 37, completed his psychiatry residency at New England
Medical Center, where he teaches a symposium on psychiatry and the
law. A specialist in forensic psychiatry, he has worked at several
area hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Ablow, married to a real estate lawyer and has a 15-month-old
daughter, has appeared on ``Court TV'' to discuss the Eddie O'Brien
murder case, has taped a Montel Williams show on the topic of
predators, and has written columns on psychiatry and society for
the Washington Post and The Improper Bostonian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good thing that psychiatry is in the
courtroom,'' said Ablow. ``In seeking the facts, the system runs
the risk of punishing people who might be better treated or
controlled than by throwing them in jail.''

MOXLEY MYSTERY DEEPENS WITH STABBING OF EX-SUSPECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DANIEL VASQUEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Like the Greenwich, Conn., murder case that brought
him notoriety nearly a quarter century ago, the stabbing of Kenneth
Littleton last month in his Beacon Hill apartment remains mired in
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Boston police called the incident an apparent suicide
attempt. But detectives are investigating the possibility of a
crime committed against Littleton, once a prime suspect in the
bludgeoning death of 15-year-old Martha Moxley.
</P>
<P>
   The Moxley case, currently being reinvestigated by a grand jury
after 24 years, has drawn national attention because two nephews of
Ethel Kennedy _ and cousins of Joseph P. Kennedy II, a former
representative, _ are suspects. Littleton, who was the tutor to
Ethel Kennedy's nephews, was also considered a suspect before being
removed from the official list after being granted immunity to
testify last year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the wake of the stabbing incident in Boston, Littleton,
47, is the subject of a new spate of questions about his conduct
July 21, when police arrived at his apartment and found a bleeding
Littleton being carried out by paramedics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investigation is to determine whether or not the wounds
are self-inflicted by Mr. Littleton,'' said Sergeant Detective
Margot Hill, Boston Police spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Littleton was admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital with
knife wounds to his chest and gashes on an arm. He has since been
released, but has refused to talk to police without his attorney
present, Hill said, which has not yet happened.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources, at least one attempted police interview
was canceled by Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of hard to close the case if he's not talking,''
Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Although somewhat unusual in attempted suicide investigations,
Boston detectives ordered a search later that afternoon of
Littleton's second-floor Bowdoin Street apartment.
</P>
<P>
   What investigators found, police sources say, raised plenty of
questions:
</P>
<P>
   What was on the burned pages of a diary found in the apartment?
Why did his girlfriend's story about what happened the night of the
incident change? And why was the 10-inch kitchen knife allegedly
used by Littleton wrapped in a paper towel?
</P>
<P>
   Investigators carried away a kitchen knife with blood, a steel
knife sharpener, a purple blood-stained shirt, a bloodied paper
towel, and a pair of Drake's sneakers from the apartment _ which
Littleton has shared with his girlfriend, Anne E. Drake, for the
past five years.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the charred diary pages _ which appeared to have been
plucked from the binding and burned, according to the first Boston
police officer on the scene _ that brought high-powered defense
attorney Mickey Sherman to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman represents one of Ethel Kennedy's nephews, Michael
Skakel, who, along with his brother, Thomas, remains a suspect in
Moxley's violent murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally bizarre. I can't say whether it's a positive or
negative development in respect to Michael Skakel. . . On the other
hand, if it is merely a sad episode in the troubled life of Kenneth
Littleton, our hearts go out to him. Chalk it up to one more
bizarre twist in the case of Martha Moxley.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Sherman confirmed he hired a private investigator to
determine if Littleton's stabbing was in any way related to the
unsolved murder. On Monday, Sherman said he still does not know
what were on those burned pages but still ``holds hope that
something from the Littleton investigation may prove of some help
to Michael.''
</P>
<P>
   What Kenneth Littleton knows or does not know about the death of
Moxley, a golden-haired daughter of a wealthy Connecticut couple,
has been the target of much speculation and innuendo. For two
decades Littleton was a suspect, but the burden lifted from being
granted immunity by prosecutors last year has hardly left him free
of pressure.
</P>
<P>
   According to a source who knows him well, Littleton has spent a
large part of his life being obsessed by the Kennedys and Skakels,
believing his life is endangered by the powerful and influential
families.
</P>
<P>
   The night before Littleton was rushed to the Boston hospital, he
spent the evening watching the media coverage of John F. Kennedy
Jr.'s fatal plane crash, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime the Martha Moxley case was brought up, or whenever the
Kennedys end up on TV, poor Ken would become traumatized,'' the
source said.
</P>
<P>
   Max Beck, Littleton's attorney, said he cannot discuss
Littleton's history or his involvement in the Moxley investigation,
but added ``Ken Littleton had nothing whatsoever to do with the
murder of Martha Moxley. Ken Littleton himself is a victim of the
Martha Moxley case.''
</P>
<P>
   The Martha Moxley case has, indeed, been generating a flood of
news stories over the past year. On an award-winning Web site
maintained by a childhood friend, Moxley can be seen the way her
family and friends remember her _ in vivid colors, smiling happily
with golden locks. In one shot, she poses for a camera in pigtails
and her favorite sandals, next to her father and his red riding
lawnmower. In another photo, the teenager sits between two school
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Moxley moved with her family from California to the
exclusive, gated community of Belle Haven in Greenwich, Conn.,
about a year before she was found beaten to death with a golf club
near a tree in her family's back lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Moxley's family had moved next door to the Skakel family. Moxley
soon became friends with Michael and Thomas Skakel, then aged 15
and 17, and nephews by marriage of Senator Robert F. Kennedy. Their
father, Rushton Skakel, is the brother of Ethel Kennedy, Robert
Kennedy's widow.
</P>
<P>
   Littleton was hired as a live-in tutor for Michael and Thomas by
the Skakel family on Oct. 30, 1975. That night, Moxley was
murdered.
</P>
<P>
   Moxley was seen with her two brothers that night, but she was
last seen alive with Thomas, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Littleton and the Skakel brothers were considered
suspects, but the investigation eventually stalled. All three have
maintained their innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Then last fall, a Connecticut grand jury was convened on the
case, and witnesses were subpoenaed for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   In their quest for a suspect, state prosecutors granted immunity
to Littleton, who had earlier invoked his right against
self-incrimination. In exchange for his testimony, the Connecticut
State Attorney's office agreed not to prosecute Littleton for any
crime connected to the Moxley murder, and removed him from the
suspect list.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, many key witnesses have been reluctant or unable
to testify, including Rushton Skakel, father of Michael and Thomas.
Two weeks ago, a Florida appellate court ordered Rushton Skakel,
who is now 74 and allegedly in failing health, to testify before
the Connecticut grand jury, nearly a year after he was first
summoned to appear.
</P>
<P>
   While investigators say the case is progressing _ some believe
the grand jury will end by late fall _ Littleton's life continues
to be troubled.
</P>
<P>
   About a month ago, according to authorites, Littleton checked
himself into a mental health institution and was released five days
before his stabbing.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same week John F. Kennedy Jr., along with his wife
Carolyn, and sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette, died in a plane crash
near Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   After Littleton was taken to the hospital with stab wounds,
Drake told police he had been behaving as though his life was in
danger. She later told an Associated Press reporter that Kennedy's
death led him to take his life because the handsome, popular
magazine publisher was his favorite member of that family.
</P>
<P>
   The night of the stabbing, Drake said, Littleton had watched
coverage of the crash for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Drake said she left him in front of the television and went to
bed at about 10:30 p.m., but was awoken by a loud thump as
Littleton fell to the floor in the hallway outside their bedroom
door.
</P>
<P>
   But in a later police report, Drake allegedly told police that
she was sleeping with Littleton and awoke when he fell to the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   According to one investigator, the story change may be
attributed to Drake being shaken during her first police interview.
She was also questioned by homicide detectives that morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact they got a search warrant tells me something she said
made detectives wonder,'' said a police source. ``Her stories were
not consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Another investigator said it wasn't clear why they would find
the knife used in a purported suicide attempt wrapped in a paper
towel _ something usually associated with a suspect trying to hide
fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   When reached by telephone by The Globe, Drake said, ``I'm sorry,
I can't talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill said detectives hope to meet with Littleton this week and
at least answer the basic question: Did he stab himself?
</P>
<P>
   ``A good detective will never just take the word of the only
person at a scene,'' Hill said. ``Our detectives are being very
thorough, that's why they continue to try to discuss the case with
Mr. Littleton himself.''

Napoleon's Exile on Saint Helena 
By Jean-Paul Kauffmann

<TEXT>
<P>
   Napoleon, defeated at Waterloo, imagined he would spend the rest
of his life as a prisoner at an English country manor. Instead the
British decided to send him to the remote, inhospitable island of
Saint Helena, off the coast of Africa, where he spent the six years
before his early death at 51.
</P>
<P>
   Napoleon remains the most written-about figure in history after
Jesus Christ, and the period of his exile and imprisonment on Saint
Helena has exerted a special fascination. Napoleon knew that it
would. Everyone around him was busy taking notes that would make
the writers famous as the ``four evangelists'' who chronicled every
moment of Napoleon's day, and every word the emperor uttered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Black Room at Longwood'' is the most recent addition to
the shelf of books about those years on Saint Helena, and it became
a bestseller in France when it was published there two years ago.
Jean-Paul Kauffmann saucily admits in his first sentence that he
has ``never had any particular liking for Napoleon.'' He has no new
facts to add to the story (which has recently been admirably told
in English in Julia Blackburn's ``The Emperor's Last Island''). But
he has nevertheless written a haunting and unforgettable book.
</P>
<P>
   Kauffmann captures the desolate atmosphere of Napoleon's last
home with evocative precision; his book is a meditation on
imprisonment, on loss, on the passage of time, on the vanity of
human wishes. It is written with a gifted reporter's eye for detail
and with uncommon sympathy and understanding. Kaufmann never
directly refers to the three years he spent chained to a chair in a
Beirut basement as the prisoner of Shiite Muslims, but his own
experiences illuminate Napoleon's situation in a unique way. ``A
prisoner without hope is a like a dead man,'' Kauffmann says to a
vexed and contrarian British tourist, who replies, ``Ah, yes! Mr.
Answer-for-everything. How would you know? You know everything
about Napoleon, and now you're holding forth pedantically about
people in prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Kauffmann's book is structured as a diary of a week he spent on
present-day Saint Helena, which hasn't changed much since
Napoleon's day, but is about to _ there is talk of building an
airport, and television is on the way. The visitor meets British
officials; a restaurant cook; the French consul and his father, an
eminent writer and historian, who live in Napoleon's house,
Longwood. Two British tourist ladies make recurrent appearances,
entertaining and unsettling, and there is a glimpse of a Dutch sea
captain who later becomes the first prisoner to escape from Saint
Helena. The structure is chronological but the writer's method is
not; within the diary Kauffmann moves freely across time to develop
his themes of loss, desolation, endurance.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the figures in the contemporary landcape is vigorously
characterized, and so are all of the people around Napoleon _ the
small, devoted, and opportunistic company that voluntarily chose
exile to remain with their Emperor. And of course, Napoleon himself
is unforgettably evoked; the scenes from 1815-21 are narrated in
the present tense, just like Kauffmann's accounts of his own
encounters on Saint Helena. The Emperor _ punctiliously addressed
by the British only as the General _ is childlike in the company of
children, imperious in the presence of his jailors, spouting talk
in the company of men and women who are writing down his memories,
and, increasingly, ultimately alone with himself: In his last year,
he spent hours alone in his bath, lying, Kauffmann writes, ``in
amniotic fluid.'' ``They say that Napeoleon was poisoned, that
Montholon had fed him arsenic. The Longwood courtier didn't need to
go to that bother. One only has to spend a few hours in the
memory's tomb to realize that the prisoner had poisoned himself
with his past. Day after day for five-and-a-half years, he took the
hemlock of regret, desperately seeking to recover the consistency
of events and the essence of things.''
</P>
<P>
   The house, Longwood, a converted cowshed, roofed in Napoleon's
time in tarred canvas, and walled by rain, becomes one of the
principal characters of the book, and a dominant symbol. The house
is low, badly designed, small, uncomfortable; the humidity is
oppressive and the winds and weather hostile; termites have
repeatedly eaten it away, and the present structure is a fragile
reconstruction dating from the 1950s. Entering the house, Kauffmann
is immediately struck by its smell. ``You could mistake it for
mildew, but there are other more pervasive and complex strands in
it: scents of exotic woods, something like sandalwood and cedar. It
makes you think of the stale iodine smell that pervades
out-of-season seaside villas, plus overtones of resin. The most
lingering of all is the odor of boredom. The incense of melancholy
and the musk of depression permeate the inside of the house. You
don't need to know who lived there. . . . All prisons are the same
in this respect. They are permeated by a strange aroma that is
stale, rancid, and sweaty.''
</P>
<P>
   The smell of Longwood has a Proustian effect on Kauffmann more
powerful than one he sought to create. He has brought along with
him a bottle of Napoleon's cologne, bottled from a formula
developed on Saint Helena in an attempt to reproduce the scent he
had worn in the days of his glory; Kauffmann planned to open the
bottle in Napoleon's bathroom and recover the past. By the time he
does it, the gesture has become irrelevant, because the past has
already permeated the present, and time has become at once
meaningless and the only measure of meaning. He has come face to
face with what he has already experienced, arrived at an
understanding of what he already knows.

THE SPIRIT MOVES THIS SLEUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Author Michelle Blake has a twist on the
typical autobiographical novel, creating a character who she says
is ``the person I might have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake, who received a Masters of Theological Studies from
Harvard Divinity School in 1992, had seriously considered becoming
an Episcopal priest _ which is the role she gives to Lily Connor,
the protagonist in her new mystery series.
</P>
<P>
   In Blake's case, however, a woman priest advised her against
continuing on at the divinity school, saying ``it would be
wasteful.''
</P>
<P>
   A published poet, Blake took her adviser's words to heart: ``
`We have all been given gifts,' she told me, and this was my
gift.'' So Blake turned to fiction. ``The Tentmaker,'' to be
published next month, is the first in a mystery series by Putnam.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Stanford in 1973, Blake started
theological studies at the Episcopal Theological School in
Cambridge. But she did not complete that course. ``It would have
been a great time,'' she said, citing a new prayer book and
enhanced roles for women in the church, ``if I hadn't been so much
in flux myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Her recent studies at the Harvard Divinity School marked a
second run at the priesthood.
</P>
<P>
   Although a Texan by birth, the 47-year-old Blake describes
``moving back'' to Cambridge a dozen years ago. Residents of San
Francisco at the time, she and her husband argued with guests at a
gathering where they were told: ``This is a party, not an encounter
group.'' The remark, she says, made her realize that ``we were
really East Coast people.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Blake is so rooted in Cambridge that she has lost
all traces of her native accent.
</P>
<P>
   She lives with her husband, author Dennis McFarland, and their
two teenage children in a Georgian-style condominium at the foot of
West Cambridge's Avon Hill. She teaches at Tufts.
</P>
<P>
   But Lily Connor, her heroine, has an even grander address _ the
Victorian-Gothic rectory St. Mary of the Garden, a thinly-disguised
Church of the Advent moved a few blocks down Beacon Hill, across
Charles Street, and nearer the Public Garden _ but every bit as
high church and old Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Other immediately recognizable venues in ``The Tentmaker''
include St. Paul's Cathedral (renamed St. Michael of the Angels
after the church in Dallas that Blake attended as a child) and the
Cowley Fathers monastery in Cambridge _ as well as several local
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   For the first mystery in the series, Connor is what is known
among the Episcopalian clergy as a ``tentmaker,'' an ordained
priest who works at something else but is available as an interim
pastor for a church. The description is from St. Paul, whose ``day
job'' was that of a maker of tents.
</P>
<P>
   That temporary status, Blake said, suggests a ``tenuous''
relationship to the church, which ``is what is most like me'' in
the character.
</P>
<P>
   Connor is assigned to fill in at St. Mary of the Garden after
its long-time pastor is found dead in somewhat mysterious
circumstances. Knowing that local Episcopalians would recognize
even a disguised Advent, Blake said that whenever someone would
start to talk about its recent pastoral troubles, ``I'd say,
`please don't tell me. I don't want to know.' ''
</P>
<P>
   She placed ``The Tentmaker'' at the Advent, Blake says,
``because I loved Charles Street and loved going down there to do
research.''
</P>
<P>
   The book does address the turmoil within the church over the
ordination of gay and lesbian priests. While Lily Connor acquires
an Irish Catholic policeman as a boyfriend during the course of the
book, her best friend is a gay monk at the Cowley Fathers
monastery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I know a lot about,'' she said. A gay priest
and a lesbian priest that she knows ``are the two most
clearly-called people I know. They are great liturgists and great
pastors.''
</P>
<P>
   Because she has been ``reading mysteries all my life,'' Blake
decided to write about these characters and subjects under the
cover of a mystery series rather than in a novel. She recalls
reading Nancy Drew mysteries as a child and cites feminist scholar
Carolyn Heilbrun, who writes mysteries under the name Amanda Cross,
as a current model.
</P>
<P>
   Blake has a two-book contract with Putnam and is finishing work
on the second installment, in which Lily Connor will return to her
old job as a counselor at a women's center. It is modeled after the
Women's Theological Center in the Back Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The move will keep her persistent sleuth, says Blake, ``on the
edge of the city's religious community.''

POLITICIANS PITCH THEIR TRADE IN BASEBALL CAPITAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ It's internationally known for baseball. But
this summer, Cooperstown has become a place for hardball. Political
hardball.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, three of the nation's political all-stars
have made sojourns to the sleepy village nestled in upstate New
York that touts itself as ``America's Home Town.''
</P>
<P>
   First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton gripped a baseball bat and
cuddled babies during her early July stop in Cooperstown on the
initial leg of her testing-of-the-waters ``listening tour'' for a
possible U.S. Senate bid.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential
front-runner signed baseballs and shook hands at a political
fund-raiser there a few weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani planned his
own political pilgrimage to Cooperstown for a meeting with the
Otsego County Republican Women's Club. Giuliani, like Clinton, is
weighing a campaign for the Senate seat being vacated by Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   With the Baseball Hall of Fame and a tree-lined main street as a
backdrop, it's no wonder Cooperstown has become the photo-op
destination for political pros. Especially considering the deep
pockets of financially flush donors who spend the summer in the
village.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good area to see what small-town America is all
about,'' said Tim Fox, general manager of the Doubleday Cafe, a
local watering hole.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for those accustomed to fair game as opposed to blood
sport, the new kind of notoriety is a bit puzzling: ``We wonder
what this is all about,'' Fox acknowledged Tuesday. ``It's sparked
a lot of talk, definitely.''
</P>
<P>
   While seeing retired sluggers on the street is not uncommon in
Cooperstown, the village of about 2,200 residents historically has
not been a hot seat for politicking. Gov. George Pataki, a
Republican, visited last year. Former Gov. Mario Cuomo, a Democrat,
once stopped in for a county party meeting. Before that, the most
prominent political headliner was then-Vice President George Bush,
who visited the Hall of Fame in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans outnumber Democrats in Otsego County by a 3-2
margin.
</P>
<P>
   To Cooperstown Mayor Wendell Tripp, a two-term Republican, the
recent political surge is akin to a batting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   First came Hillary Clinton. That ``evidently stimulated the
people on the George W. Bush campaign that this is the place to
be,'' Tripp said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And evidently, because everybody else came here, I guess, Mr.
Giuliani ...'' the Cooperstown mayor trailed off, breaking into a
guffaw. ``I don't know what the reasoning behind all that is.''
</P>
<P>
   Who's next? The Pope?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not the Pope,'' Tripp said. ``I don't know what is next. Maybe
Mr. (Russian President Boris) Yeltsin. He's been doing some strange
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Suffice to say, and locals agree, baseball will remain the name
of the game in Cooperstown to draw visitors. But anything to make
the village more of a destination is agreeable to most, even if the
political pitch throws them for a bit of a curve.

election cycles ago, the modern-day political straw poll was a
harmless enough idea. State political parties are always trying to
raise money, and the competition among presidential candidates to
make an early showing was growing increasingly intense. Straw polls
_ rough, early headcounts to measure support among the party
faithful _ were a facet of political gatherings already.So why not
get the campaigns involved in drumming up interest and charge a few
bucks at the door for those who wanted to show their colors at the
state convention? National media interest in Saturday's Iowa

ALWAYS GET OUTSIDE ADVICE DURING LAYOFFS

 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ One of the hardest things to deal with is when
your employer announces that there will be a wave of job cuts.
Until the boss spells out exactly who will be gone _ which
sometimes doesn't occur until months later _ it's easy for your
life to shift into limbo and your brain to get a little numb.
</P>
<P>
   You feel so vulnerable that it's easy to believe everything you
hear, whether it's the latest bit of office gossip or your
employer's version of the workplace gospel. Take what has happened
in the 18 months since the California State Automobile Association
announced it would slash 1,200 jobs _ 20 percent of its work force.
</P>
<P>
   Before any layoffs, the Automobile Association offered an early
retirement incentive to employees 40 and older who had been with
the company for five or more years. Most who chose early retirement
would get a pension that was 75 percent higher than normal, a
year's worth of medical insurance and other fringes.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, the Automobile Association spelled out the package
and gave employees a deadline of June 1, 1998, to sign up. It said
that people who chose early retirement would not be eligible to
collect unemployment benefits.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,900 workers decided to retire early, easily giving the
Automobile Association the job cuts it wanted. Case closed, right?
No. The case was just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   After accepting early retirement, about 600 employees eventually
decided to apply for unemployment benefits, even though the
Automobile Association said they wouldn't be eligible. People who
quit their jobs are normally ineligible for unemployment, but the
law isn't as clear-cut as the Automobile Association made it
appear.
</P>
<P>
   If you quit for good cause, you are still eligible for
unemployment. Was the potential threat of being laid off good
cause? In some cases, yes, state Administrative Law Judge Nancy
O'Brien has decided. In a recent ruling, the San Francisco judge
said that workers in the Automobile Association's claims division
are eligible for unemployment benefits.
</P>
<P>
   When they announced the planned job cuts, Automobile Association
officials said 600 of them would be in the 2,300-person claims
division, which would be restructured. Because the restructuring
would eliminate many clerical jobs and dramatically change others
in that division, O'Brien ruled that a reasonable claims worker
could believe that there would be no job for him after the
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   That reasonable worker could also believe that if he didn't
accept the early retirement package and was then laid off, the
severance package would not be as good as what he would have gotten
under early retirement. That's good cause for quitting, she said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, O'Brien said that employees in other
divisions would not have had the same good cause. Although layoffs
might eventually occur in their divisions, no restructuring had
been planned and most of the job cuts were expected to come through
attrition and early retirement. The threat to them simply wasn't as
great or as immediate, she ruled.
</P>
<P>
   So far the judge's rulings have allowed more than 100 workers to
be eligible for benefits, said Paul Drewitz, senior vice president
of corporate and legal affairs for the California State Automobile
Association. He said the Automobile Association does not plan to
appeal O'Brien's rulings.
</P>
<P>
   Workers in all sorts of jobs can take two lessons from this:
</P>
<P>
   _ Never place complete faith in what your employer tells you.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's ruling comes more than a year after the employees
had to decide on early retirement. If many claims employees trusted
the Automobile Association and didn't file for unemployment
benefits, they lost. (This is not to say that the outfit
intentionally misinformed people. Good employees just have to
examine all their options, and sometimes that means getting a
second opinion.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Know what you're entitled to _ and not entitled to _ if you
get laid off.
</P>
<P>
   If you've been loyal to a company for years or even decades,
it's easy to believe that you'll be treated gently if times get
hard.
</P>
<P>
   Realize this: Even with the misinformation, the Automobile
Association employees were treated with a lot more kindness than
most downsized workers have been.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you're in a labor union or have some other specific
protection, you might have fewer rights than you think you do when
it comes to being laid off. An employer may offer two weeks' notice
and severance pay, but don't take those for granted. They are
usually not required by law.
</P>
<P>
   Employers can't discriminate on the basis of such things as race
or sex or age, but it's hard to prove that discrimination,
especially during a wave of layoffs. Even if the California State
Automobile Association had ended up laying off a ton of workers
over 40, it could have argued that they were chosen because of
their high salaries, not their age.
</P>
<P>
   It's a jolt when you find your job in danger, especially after
you've invested so many years in it. But don't let that emotional
blow cloud your thinking. You may not have many rights, but make
sure you protect the ones that you do have.

CELTICS STILL WAIT FOR RESULTS FROM PITINO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ He is one of the regulars, just another
guy looking to cash in a long shot. Rick Pitino has picked the
Saratoga Race Course as his summer place to be, to relax, to
rejuvenate. At the Graveyard of Favorites, there's even more hope
than action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not bad,'' Pitino said. ``I miss a lot of races talking.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino isn't all talk, and the Boston Celtics have a new look to
prove it. The Celtics have had an assortment of new looks since
Pitino took over as czar of basketball operations. None of those
new looks have had the upper crust of the National Basketball
Association looking over their shoulders, bemoaning the day when
shamrocks become high fashion again. The Pitino regime is preparing
for its third season, and neither seas nor opposing defenses have
parted. Water has yet to turn into wine. Kenny Anderson has yet to
guard anybody.
</P>
<P>
   Still, nobody can accuse Pitino of doing nothing while the
empire crumbles. For one thing, the empire already was in ruins
when Pitino arrived fresh off winning the 1996 NCAA Tournament with
the Kentucky Wildcats. For another, Pitino has done everything in
his power to populate the rest of the league with former Celtics.
If you can't beat them, water them down with the players you had
who weren't good enough to beat them in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking up the old 15-67 Celtics wasn't exactly like
spray-painting graffiti inside the Louvre. As of the last time
Pitino was on the phone, Antoine Walker, Dana Barros, Pervis
Ellison and Greg Minor were the only remaining Celtics players from
opening night of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The newest Celtics include forwards Danny Fortson and Eric
Williams, swingman Calbert Cheaney and guards Eric Washington and
Wayne Turner. Actually, Williams is a new old Celtic _ sent to the
Denver Nuggets as one of Pitino's first house-cleaning measures.
The Nuggets shipped Williams, Fortson, Washington and a No. 1 pick
to the Celtics in return for guard Ron Mercer and assorted other
spare parts.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer helped win the '96 national title at Kentucky. He
averaged 17 points per game last season. On the other hand, the
Celtics have missed the playoffs the past two seasons with him.
They can do that without him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we got four assets for one,'' Pitino said. ``And
all four assets are very strong on our system. We thought we hit a
grand slam.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercer wants to be paid like a star, and he was third behind
Walker and Paul Pierce in the Celtics' pecking order. Now Mercer's
wants and needs are the Nuggets' problem. Mercer already has
declared his intention to pursue free-agency at the end of next
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we got about $1.20 on the dollar,'' Pitino said. ``We
knew we could not sign Ron Mercer. The first thing we had to do was
make our ballclub somehow as good, if not stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Where there's Pitino's will, there's a way to elevate a college
program almost overnight. Pitino did it at Providence, and he did
it at Kentucky. At the college level, a coach has a chance to
outwork, out-recruit and out-smart the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Can Pitino's hard-driving ways get the same kind of results in
the NBA? With the salary cap restrictions of the NBA, teams are
hard-pressed to stockpile the sort of depth necessary to play the
pressing, up-tempo style that Pitino favors. Besides, many players
can only stand to be driven and pushed so much before they begin
looking for an easier way to make a living. Pitino always had the
luxury in college of turning over a new team before his demands
wore too thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you try to impose your will on a franchise,''
Pitino said. ``You have an organized scheme of attack. You know
what you want to do. Our goal right now is to accumulate as much
talent as we can. We had four or five players who were at the CBA
level last year. Now we have maybe one player at the CBA level.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino had a plan from the beginning, and it revolved around Tim
Duncan. The Celtics had the best chance of drawing the winning
lottery ticket in '97, only to settle for the third pick. The drop
off from Duncan to No. 2 pick Keith Van Horn was precipitous
enough. By the time it was the Celtics' time to pick, pickings were
so slim the Chancey Billlups looked to Pitino like the best player
left on the draft board.
</P>
<P>
   That's one way to send a franchise back to the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I said when I first got hired, before the loss of Duncan
and Van Horn, is we would be in the playoffs in the third or fourth
season and at the championship level in the fifth or sixth
season,'' Pitino said. ``We're going to stick to our plan: We'll be
in the playoffs in our third or fourth year, and the championship
level in the fifth or sixth year.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino has a 55-77 record with the Celtics. In a
lockout-shortened '99 season, the Celtics finished eight games out
of the playoffs. Still, Rick Pitino can look at what he has and
say, ``I'm excited. Very excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are those who suggest that Pitino's dominant
characteristic ambidexterity: He can talk out of both sides of his
mouth without. Pitino was at Hoffman Park Courts on Tuesday
morning, conducting a free basketball clinic. At the end of the
session, Pitino took questions and answers from the kids. His
answer to the first question posed indicates that coaching in the
NBA is no day at the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does it feel to be an NBA coach?'' Pitino repeated. ``It
feels good. I love the Boston Celtics. They've won more
championships than any other franchise. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody else?''

FINDING BASEBALL PLAYERS' GRAVE SITES THROUGH A WEB SITE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Where else but a cemetery would one come up with the odd idea of
a Web site for deceased major-league baseball players?
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's where Frank Russo of East Brunswick, N.J., stumbled
onto the idea about five years ago while researching the
whereabouts of the grave of Eddie Plank, a Hall of Fame pitcher.
During the search, Russo happened upon a cemetery attendant who
suggested that Russo start a Web site detailing his research.
</P>
<P>
   That was the birth of Russo's The Deadball Era
(deadballera.webjump.com). Although several sites track the burial
locations of celebrities, Russo has the only known Web site
dedicated to the memory of deceased professional baseball players
and officials.
</P>
<P>
   Russo, a former radio announcer, said his site differs from
celebrity grave-hunting sites in which most locations are
well-documented anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finding a grave site for a ballplayer is like finding a hidden
treasure,'' he said. ``There are literally thousands buried all
over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Russo's site includes lists of major-leaguers who have died of
natural causes, suicide, accident or murder. Russo, who admits that
he was influenced by Jim Tipton's Find-A-Grave site
(www.findagrave.com), also posts photos of the grave sites of many
players and has a listings page that includes burial sites and
grave locations. His 763-page site includes a list of 430 grave
sites with 178 photos.
</P>
<P>
   The site is basic in design, and the navigation is simple. It
could use a search function. And the animated smoking gun in the
Murders section is insensitive.
</P>
<P>
   But to Russo's credit, he has dug up a lot of content.
</P>
<P>
   The Deadball Era has exhaustive sections dedicated to Hall of
Fame members, the 1927 New York Yankees, managers and executives. A
section called Oldies But Goodies lists players who lived past 80.
Russo's favorite player, Thurman Munson, makes up an entire
section. Russo is also assembling a section detailing the Carl
Mays-Ray Chapman incident. Chapman is the only major-league player
to be killed after being struck by a pitched ball.
</P>
<P>
   Russo spends from six to eight hours a day updating his site,
tapping his network of grave-hunters via e-mail for photos and
information. He has helpers in Texas, Ohio, Oregon and Minnesota.
Russo also browses through hundreds of rolls of microfilm to find
information. ``I have obits of ball players going back to 1906, so
far,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it as being able to give people a chance to delve
back into history.''
</P>
<P>
   DEALING INDIRECT: Before this summer, the biggest thing on
Atlanta Falcons holdout Jamal Anderson's site on Athlete Direct
(athletedirect.com) was instructions to do the Dirty Bird.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson has found another use for his Web site: Explaining to
his fans why he's holding out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Negotiations are not only NOT completed, I have no intention
of showing up to training camp until they ARE complete,''
Anderson's post said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson has used his site before to get his point across. In
May, Anderson posted his comments about the Falcons' reported
attempts to trade him to the New England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   MORE ON ATHLETE DIRECT: Athlete Direct has dramatically improved
its presentation with dynamic graphics, dazzling multimedia and new
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles-based company, which posts exclusive content
from sports figures such as Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman,
Rangers catcher Pudge Rodriguez and Stars goalie Ed Belfour, has
added new interactive features, including a chat area that uses
Avatars (In Avatar chats, users select an icon to represent
themselves, and other effects are possible. It sounds cheesy, but
it adds to the chat experience).
</P>
<P>
   LINKS LINK: The 1999 PGA Championship at Medinah (Ill.) Country
Club has an official site (www.pga.com) powered by IBM. With the
help of Big Blue technology, users can follow the tournament with a
customizable Java leader board, CourseCam images from the 11th
through 18th holes and streaming audio and video of player
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE LOVE OF TROY: Some of the best sites for Cowboys
quarterback Troy Aikman fans:
</P>
<P>
   Troy Aikman on Athlete Direct (athletedirect.com): Aikman's
official site includes a chat area, journal, games, multimedia and
official Troy merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   BlueKate's Page (hometown.aol.com/BlueKate): Kathryn Hansen of
Fort Worth posts the latest Aikman and Cowboys news, training camp
photos, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Bev's Troy Page (members.aol.com/skylare/Tindex.html): An
outdated site, but its lasting qualities include a trivia test and
a photo tour of Aikman's hometown of Henryetta, Okla.

 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KENORA, Ontario _ First there was the cod war, with Canadian
patrol boats slashing the trawl gear and seizing the boats of New
England fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the salmon war, with British Columbia fishermen
blockading an Alaska-bound US ferry while the premier of that
western province railed against Uncle Sam.
</P>
<P>
   Now another nasty fish fight is looming between the United
States and Canada, this time over a buttery-tasting game fish that
Americans call walleye and Canadians know as pickerel.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the widening fracas is a new Canadian regulation
requiring American anglers to stay in Ontario fishing lodges as a
condition for hooking walleye in Canada's portion of Lake of the
Woods. The lake's famed fishing waters cover 1,215 square miles
between Minnesota and Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   The rule could spell economic ruin for an obscure American
enclave wedged between Manitoba and Ontario. Nearly all of the 90
or so doughty inhabitants of Minnesota's Northwest Angle _ a
geographic oddity that has no land link to the rest of the state _
make their living catering to sports fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   So the Angle is threatening, loudly, to secede from the United
States, saying that may be the only way left to legally snare
fishermen under Ontario's revised rules.
</P>
<P>
   But first, vow denizens of the enclave, there's going to be one
doozy of fight over Stizostedion vitreum, Latin name for the fish
also known as yellow pickerel, dore, and walleye pike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to raise hell until this issue is resolved,'' said
Gary Dietzler, owner of a bar and fishing lodge in the Northwest
Angle's only settlement, Angle Inlet. ``Or we're going to join
Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   The howls of outrage from the obscure patch of US turf are
echoing far beyond the spectacularly island-studded Lake of the
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   In the Minnesota capital, St. Paul, the pique over pickerel has
pro wrestler-turned-governor Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura threatening
to shut down a 43-mile section of Canadian National railway that
curves into Minnesota on its way from Manitoba to Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the kind of person you want mad at you,'' the
250-pound governor warned Canada.
</P>
<P>
   And in Washington last week, Ontario's crackdown on Americans
hoping to hook a panful of the delectable game fish caused the US
government to file a formal complaint under the North American Free
Trade Agreement, starting a process that could ignite a serious
trade dispute between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Charlene Barshefsky, the US trade representative, said: ``We are
concerned by Canada's . . . discriminatory practices that have a
severe negative effect on Minnesota's sport-fishing and tourism
industries.''
</P>
<P>
   All this over a chunk of American territory that, on a map,
looks as if it shouldn't be where it is in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The Northwest Angle is the most northerly piece of the lower 48,
occupying a small peninsula jutting from the eastern edge of
Manitoba on Lake of the Woods. Its inhabitants must drive some 20
miles of gravel road through Canada to regain their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   The origins of the Angle are obscure. According to one account,
it remained part of the United States because its fiercely patrotic
people refused to join Canada when the international line was drawn
between the two countries. As this tale goes, Ottawa didn't dare
send the Northwest Canadian Mounted Police to force such
pugnaciously red-blooded Yanks to kneel before the Maple Leaf.
</P>
<P>
   A less rousing and more likely explanation is that surveyors
after the War of 1812 drew a line running northwest from the outlet
of Rainy River _ thereby creating the peculiar piece _ in order to
guarantee Americans access to the headwaters of the Mississippi,
which were then mistakenly thought to rise due west of Lake of the
Woods (the river actually starts to the south).
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the Northwest Angle is as much a part of United
States as Boston or Boise, although its existence has seldom, if
ever, been noticed much beyond Lake of the Woods.
</P>
<P>
   That's changing as the Angle becomes the flashpoint in this
latest trade row, which started last year with Ontario's abrupt
announcement that Americans fishing for pickerel in Canadian waters
must stay at Canadian hotels or lodges as a price for the right to
fish.
</P>
<P>
   The huge majority of anglers fishing the Lake of the Woods are
well-heeled Americans, and there is intense competition between
Minnesota and Ontario for a share of their business. Fishing and
related tourism generate $60 million a year for the economically
hard-pressed communities on the lake's shores.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Americans fishing on the Canadian side _ which,
because of the geology of the lake, is richer in walleyes and other
game fish _ were required only to buy a Canadian fishing license to
catch their quota. They were free to sleep, eat and frolic where
they chose, whether in Ontario or the rustic inns of the Northwest
Angle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our survival comes from providing beds to anglers, guiding for
them, renting them boats, or selling them booze, food, tackle,''
said Dietzler. ``And our business has declined by nearly 50 percent
in the last year. It's a real hit below the belt.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada insists its motives are purely environmental, portraying
the new rule as a noble effort to protect pickerel stocks from
overfishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about conservation, Ontario is doing what it can to
preserve its walleye or pickerel,'' said Ryan Sword, a spokesman
for Ontario's Ministry of Natural Resources. ``Ultimately, this
ministry is responsible for the long-term survival of fish stock in
Ontario waters.''
</P>
<P>
   But American critics dismiss the conservation claim as a cynical
ploy. ``They are waving the ecological flag to cover a raw grab for
fishing dollars,'' said Dietzler, whose dock lies just a few
hundred feet from Ontario's waters. ``And, anyway, there are better
ways to do conservation than killing your neighbor's business.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans argue that the greater threat to the lake's walleye
stocks come from the wide nets of commercial fishermen _ all of
them Canadians working Ontario waters _ not by the relatively small
numbers of fish hooked by sport fishers. That argument is generally
backed by scientists of both countries.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Americans say, it's ludicrous for Canada to assert
that it is protecting walleyes by requiring US anglers to stay at
Canadian lodges.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about scarcity, this is about unfair rules meant
to force nonresident anglers to spend money in Canada as the
condition for taking the fish,'' said James Southwick, a
Minneapolis lawyer and former high-ranking US trade official.
``It's all about competing economic interests, not an endangered
resource. We see it as clearly a violation of NAFTA.''
</P>
<P>
   The US government agrees, accusing Canada last week of flouting
free trade agreements between the two countries by using fishing
regulations to give an artificial boost to Ontario's tourism
industry and undercutting fish lodges in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   American fishermen, of course, are still free to pull walleyes
from the US portion of the lake. Trouble is, the American swath of
Lake of the Woods, while huge, is mostly shallow, dense with water
weeds, and short on full-sized walleyes _ the fish spawn in US
waters, but prefer to glide through the deeper, cooler waters in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Lodge owners in the Northwest Angle are cheered by Washington's
tough response. But they wonder if the creaky machinery of
international trade law can grind quickly enough to save their
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the only solution is quitting the American republic to
join the next-door Dominion.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, the secessionist talk is partly just to make the
politicians stand up and take notice,'' said Dietzler. ``But
there's a logic, too. If we joined Canada, our guests would have
the same rights as guests at the Canadian lodges, and we'd be back
on the same competitive ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota politicians are ready for a rumble. Ventura said his
state is taking aim at a section of the Canadian National railway
that loops through a short section of Minnesota on its way from
Manitoba to Thunder Bay, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   A bill before the state's Legislature would slap hefty fees on
the Canadian freight trains that rumble through, laden with wheat
and lumber. And Ventura has hinted at dealing a body blow to Canada
by blocking the trains altogether until the fishing dispute is
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ontario isn't going to get away with blatantly unfair rules,''
he said. ``Canada shouldn't mess with Minnesota.''

THE MYTHMAKERS BEHIND THE `BLAIR' BUZZ 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It used to be that only films with the word ``Star'' in the
title generated their own off-screen mythology. That all changed
with the Internet, and now obsessive enthusiasts are creating Web
sites to memorialize their favorite films and television shows. But
fans of ``The Blair Witch Project'' have taken the phenomenon a
step further. They will tell you outright that they consider
themselves partly responsible for the online promotion. Who are
they? Why are they doing this?
</P>
<P>
   --Jeff Johnson wants the world to know that he created the first
online fan site last December, when most folks were still focused
on the holiday blockbusters. Johnson, a Cape Cod native who sells
aquatics merchandise in Northern California, became fascinated with
the film after he saw footage on the Independent Film Channel last
summer. ``It sucks you right in,'' says the amateur film director,
whose site is at www0.delphi.com/blairwitch. Many of the other fans
consider Johnson, 33, the ``grandpappy'' of the ``Blair Witch''
bunch; he cheerfully says the fans are ``one big, happy demented
family. I see them as people who want to be involved, like the
proverbial little brother who wants to be taken seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   --Eric Alan Ivins and Abigail Marceluk met in February on the
``Blair Witch'' bulletin board. He's a computer technician, and
she's a film student at Temple University. They started the second
fan site, and after they met in person at the Florida Film Festival
in June, they decided to get married. Ivins says their site (at
http://tbwp.freeservers.com/main.html) gives them ``an online
presence, like a synergy.'' The creepy film hardly inspires
thoughts of cuddling up at the campfire, but you never can tell.
``I met the woman I'm going to spend the rest of my life with
because of this independent film,'' Ivins says. And who said
Internet addicts don't have a life?
</P>
<P>
   --Cecilia Gin's site, called ``The Blair Warner Project'' speaks
for itself. The 27-year old San Francisco consultant made a
connection between ``Blair Witch'' and the well-heeled character in
the television show, ``Facts of Life.'' ``You just do it to be
silly,'' Gin says. The site is at
www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Lounge/3027/Blair.html.
</P>
<P>
   --James Higgins, a computer trainer in New York, had recently
put up a site counting down to his wedding when he heard about
``The Blair Witch Project.'' He thought it would be fun to put up a
countdown to the movie. ``I got a creative charge out of the whole
mythology, and I found myself wanting to make a little contribution
myself,'' Higgins says. His site counted down to the July 30 wide
release opening in days, hours, minutes and seconds. Alas, it's now
obsolete, although the fans are already talking about doing
``promotion'' for the next film by ``Blair Witch'' directors Dan
Myrick and Ed Sanchez, a comedy called ``Heart of Love.'' On the
Internet, the countdown never ceases.

PRIVACY LOST AND REGAINED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a story about the way two seemingly innocuous features
of computer technology have combined to violate a lot of people's
privacy. And it's a story of how a cable modem provider nearly made
a huge mistake, but ultimately decided to do the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than a year ago, I got a MediaOne cable modem for
my apartment. At the time, MediaOne asked me what I wanted for an
e-mail address. For the past sixteen years I've used the name
``simsong,'' so the folks at MediaOne assigned me the mailbox
``simsong(at)ne.mediaone.net.''
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne also wanted a ``hostname,'' or the name that would be
used to identify my home computer on the Internet. I didn't know
what name I should use, so the person from MediaOne suggested that
I use the name ``simsong.ne.mediaone.net.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's what I did.
</P>
<P>
   The second technological feature in this story is called ARP,
the Internet's Address Resolution Protocol. When one computer on a
local area network tries to send a message to another, it uses ARP
to find that computer's address. Unlike other Internet protocols,
ARP messages are broadcast to everyone on your local net. In fact,
there is a popular Unix program called ``arpwatch'' that watches
the network for ARPs and sends an e-mail message whenever it sees a
new computer. The e-mail message includes the person's hostname, IP
address, the precise time that the ARP was seen, and the
manufacturer of the person's Ethernet card.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago I started running the arpwatch program on my
computer that is connected to the MediaOne cable modem. I was
amazed by what I found: within the course of 10 minutes, I had
hostnames of more than 300 different computers on my neighborhood
cable segment. Many of the hostnames were recognizable individuals
_ they were a first name and a last name, or they were a last name
and a first initial. I even recognized a friend of mine who is a
prominent science writer. (He uses a Fast Etherlink XL card in a
Gateway 2000, in case you are interested.)
</P>
<P>
   I left arpwatch running, and over the next week I collected 400
more ARPs. What was particularly interesting about this second
batch is that I could coordinate the time that I saw the hostname
with the time the person turned on his computer. With a little bit
of programming, I could have modified arpwatch to watch all of the
hosts on the network and let me know when they were turned off.
This would let me know, with a high degree of probability, when a
person had left his home for the day and gone to work.
</P>
<P>
   ARPs were pretty innocuous in the university environment in
which the Internet protocols were first developed, but this
information could easily be abused in an urban setting. I could use
this information to target houses for burglary _ just watch for a
house whose cable modem has gone dead for five days, which probably
means the family is on vacation. Or I could call the person up on
the phone and do a pretty good job impersonating a MediaOne
technician. ``Hello, Mr. Smith. I see you are using an Etherlink XL
card in a Gateway 2000. We are running a special deal, in
conjunction with Gateway, for people who pay by credit card. Would
you like to enroll?''
</P>
<P>
   I took my list of 735 MediaOne hostnames, IP addresses, and
Ethernet cards and sent it to Rick Jenkinson, a spokesperson at
MediaOne. I also sent a handful of e-mail messages directly to
people on the list, asking how they felt about the fact that this
information was so easily available. Finally, I asked a bunch of
people from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for their
opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the technologists seemed to accept this lack-of-privacy
as an inherent result of the underlying technology. ``I know that I
should be saying something sanctimonious about privacy but frankly
I'm just happy when the network is up,'' responded Philip
Greenspun, a researcher at MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science,
who has subscribed to MediaOne for nearly two years. Other people
had similar reactions: they knew nothing was private on cable
modems _ some said I was foolish to have thought otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one person I contacted sent a complaint to MediaOne
about my contacting him, and included a copy of my e-mail message.
Eight days later, I received a message from Rick Jenkinson, my
MediaOne contact, saying the company ``will be contacting you in
regards to sending unsolicited e-mail as it relates to your
customer service agreement with us.''
</P>
<P>
   I took Jenkinson's message as a veiled threat to stop my
newsgathering activities _ that is, to stop contacting other
customers _ or risk having my cable modem service disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   I hope Jenkinson's e-mail message sets off alarm bells inside
the heads of Massachusetts state regulators. If MediaOne wants to
be the sole cable into our homes, offering television, Internet,
and telephone, it can't make implied threats to people who are
engaged in activities it doesn't like. Regulators certainly
wouldn't tolerate Bell Atlantic sending its Annoyance Call Bureau
after community activists, even if the activists were calling up
every person in the phone book trying to raise money for their
cause. MediaOne needs to realize the responsibility implicit in
being a provider of two-way communications.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, I never heard back from MediaOne's complaint
department. Instead, I got an e-mail message on Monday from Rob
Stoddard, MediaOne's vice president of corporate communications.
``MediaOne has changed its policy and will no longer be assigning
host names based on a customer's e-mail address,'' he wrote to me.
Furthermore, he said, any current customers can contact MediaOne to
have their host names changed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the cable modem industry is working on a new
standard, called DOCSIS 1.1, that should eliminate the ARP privacy
problem altogether. The new cable modems screen out ARP messages
that are destined for other subscribers, which makes it a lot
harder to covertly monitor everyone in your network neighborhood.
According to Stoddard, MediaOne will start deploying these new
modems sometime in the coming year.

 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Next month, amid the hubbub of the Ryder Cup at The
Country Club in Brookline, Tony Bennett will take the stage at
Symphony Hall, with John Williams and the Boston Pops, to croon
some tunes in tribute to a one of the great athletes of the
century, Arnold Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   The event has all the ingredients of one of those memorable
evenings that evoke the image of Boston as a grand place.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, no one would have imagined that ``The Gala: A
Tribute to Arnold Palmer and Golf'' could have anything to do with
a bunch of agents representing hockey and baseball players in an
office just down Huntington Avenue from Symphony Hall.
</P>
<P>
   But in the three years since Boston Garden executive Larry
Moulter, Bruins legend Bobby Orr, and ad executive Ed Eskandarian
bought Bob Woolf Associates, things have changed.
</P>
<P>
   The name, for one. Now it's simply Woolf Associates.
</P>
<P>
   The clients, for another. The agency, once dedicated almost
entirely to representing athletes such as Larry Bird, Julius
Erving, and Carl Yastrzemski, has expanded into new areas: managing
and owning major events, and advising companies on marketing
through sports and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've surprised a lot of people. Woolf is different today from
when we bought it,'' said Larry Moulter, president and chief
executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a major stumble in January in its aborted attempt to
represent the Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams, and with the
loss of long-time client Larry King, the radio and television
personality, Moulter says Woolf Associates is poised for continued
growth as an integrated marketing agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been about steadying our business and entering new
areas,'' Moulter said. ``Right now we have a platform _ I prefer to
look at it as a latform rather than a plateau _ from which to
launch the next growth era for Woolf.''
</P>
<P>
   It is all a long way from Earl Wilson's no-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching for the Red Sox at Fenway Park on June 26, 1962, Wilson
allowed the lowly Los Angeles Angels no hits in a nine-inning
victory. Endorsement offers began pouring in, and Wilson needed
help. A car accident and the need for a new contract with the Red
Sox eventually steered him to a criminal lawyer who had played a
little basketball at Boston College. His name: Bob Woolf.
</P>
<P>
   Woolf met Wilson in an era when professional athletes often
negotiated their own contracts, in deals sealed with a firm
handshake, a puff of cigar smoke, and the player's signature.
Within a decade, Woolf established Bob Woolf Associates and
single-handedly made that era seem as distant in time as Babe Ruth
pitching for the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   When competition narrowed the market in the late 1970s and
original clients began to retire, Bob Woolf Associates sought new
business. It arrived from Indiana, a basketball player named Larry
Bird who did for Woolf what he did for the Celtics, helping to
attract a new generation of clients to the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Woolf died suddenly in 1993 in a boat off Florida, apparently of
a heart attack. Afterward, his memory lost luster, as some clients
sued his estate alleging that he had made false claims.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of Woolf's death, Moulter, Orr, and Eskandarian
each, in his own way, were looking for something new.
</P>
<P>
   Moulter, as head of the old Boston Garden, had just played a
seminal role in the development of what would become the
FleetCenter. Orr had thrilled millions of hockey fans in a career
that revolutionized the game and that brought him fame throughout
New England and across Canada. But he had remained mindful that
some dirty play on the part of one of his agents had probably cost
him a substantial sum of money, including a possible ownership
interest in the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Eskandarian had been expanding his advertising firm, Arnold
Communications, in a series of acquisitions. He recognized a
similar opportunity in Bob Woolf Associates.
</P>
<P>
   With Woolf's son Gary and wife Anne looking to sell the firm,
Moulter envisioned his future. Eskandarian seems to have liked the
idea from the start, and the two men coaxed Orr to come along for
the ride. They bought the company for $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not something I was sure I wanted to get involved
with,'' Orr said. ``But from a number of perspectives, the money,
the work, the opportunity to work with young guys and guide their
careers, I am really happy that I said yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I like about it,'' Eskandarian said, ``is Larry is great
at running the operation and Bobby is sort of our standard. We want
to make sure we build relationships and treat our customers and our
athletes at the standard Bobby would treat them. He has a huge
input into what we do and how we do it.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been Moulter's role to manage turning the Bob Woolf
Associates ship in midcourse. No one would ever dominate the
business like Bob Woolf, and for the firm to be profitable, it had
to evolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a big, big ocean liner, but it still was a pretty
well-institutionalized business, and we had to move it around,''
Moulter said.

   LOS ANGELES _ Take a guess when the first computer graphics were
seen on TV. Go ahead. 1983? 1976? 1968? Nah, it was a lot earlier.
</P>
<P>
   According to ``The Story of Computer Graphics,'' a handsome new
documentary shot in high-definition video and debuting at 8:30 p.m.
Sunday at Los Angeles' Shrine Auditorium, the first television
computer graphics were shown Dec. 16, 1951, on Edward R. Murrow's
show, ``See It Now.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the history of so much else in
technology after World War II, the graphics were created for the
military, then flush with cash in the first fearful years of the
Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The graphics were created by SAGE, ``a computer so big that
people worked inside it,'' according to one person in the film. The
computer was part of the nation's new air-defense systems, and the
graphic was created by an oscilloscope rendering the projected path
and speed of a missile.
</P>
<P>
   From this simple line drawing, we eventually got ``Star Wars:
Episode I _ The Phantom Menace.'' Maybe it's not that big a leap of
logic after all.
</P>
<P>
   The film itself is well done, the product of three years of work
overseen by about 30 members of SIGGRAPH, the huge
research-oriented special interest group of ACM (formerly the
Association of Computing Machinery) that focuses on computer
graphics.
</P>
<P>
   This week, SIGGRAPH comes to the Los Angeles Convention Center
(the film will be shown repeatedly during the week there, too),
attracting 50,000 graphics wizards of all kinds to show off their
latest bleeding-edge technologies, art, animation and more.
</P>
<P>
   The 93-minute film itself talks to many of the field's true
pioneers, from the men who invented Bezier curves and the computer
mouse to SGI and Netscape founder James Clark and Adobe Systems CEO
John Warnock to the king of ``Star Wars,'' George Lucas, and his
nine-time Oscar-winning visual effects honcho, Dennis Murren.
</P>
<P>
   The film is directed by Frank Foster, a vice president at Sony
Imageworks, and he does a good job explaining and illustrating a
lot of sometimes arcane information in a relatively brief time.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, though, it's not nearly as visually engaging as
you might expect (or hope), given the subject matter.
</P>
<P>
   One particular disappointment: The really over-the-top eye candy
of recent times makes up only a small portion of the film. That's a
shame, because many of the graphics are just eye-popping when shown
on a high-definition screen.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the film is devoted to the field's development over
a few decades of time, so what once were revolutionary new visions
now are low-resolution vector drawings up-converted to
high-definition TV from ancient, often fuzzy graphics formats.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, much of the film is talking heads, often engaging
interviews of often aging pioneers who look wonderfully
true-to-life in HDTV but aren't necessarily the most eye-catching
of fellows. There aren't a lot of movie stars here.
</P>
<P>
   The film does have some tremendous moments, however.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Blinn (a former graphics whiz at La Canada Flintridge's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory and now with Microsoft Graphics) gives a
wonderful, simple, illustrated explanation of how a colleague's
teapot made for a perfect test of graphic rendering programs.
</P>
<P>
   He then walks viewers through the various improvements that have
been made in graphics technology, showing what wireframes and Phong
shading and radiosity all mean.
</P>
<P>
   That quick segment alone could serve as a five-minute graphics
primer for every school in the country. Blinn, by the way, will be
honored at SIGGRAPH this year for his longtime contributions to the
field.
</P>
<P>
   There are other such moments, and they enrich the film nicely.
But personally, I would have preferred to see more of the creations
of the many pioneers, and less of their faces as they talked about
those creations. As they say in writing class, show, don't tell.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
The film: ``The Story of Computer Graphics.'' &UR;  &QL; 
 &LR; The stars: Lots of computers and nearly 50 graphics pioneers who
have coaxed magic from the machine. &UR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Behind the scenes: Directed by Frank Foster. Written by Judson
Rosebush. &UR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Running time: One hour, 33 minutes. &UR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Playing: 8:30 p.m. Sunday at the Shrine Auditorium, 665 W.
Jefferson Blvd., Los Angeles; then five times a day on HDTV during
SIGGRAPH at the Los Angeles Convention Center, 1201 S. Figueroa
St., Los Angeles. SIGGRAPH runs from Sunday through Aug. 13. &UR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Our rating: 2 1/2 stars &QL; 
IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   SIGGRAPH is a can't miss for people interested in virtually any
aspect of computer graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Registration starts at 6 p.m. Saturday with classes beginning at
1:30 p.m. Sunday and running through Tuesday. A separate series of
gatherings featuring technical papers, panels and sketches on a
wide range of graphics, animation and related topics starts
Wednesday and wraps up Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Among this year's highlights are an art gallery of digital
creations, the ``Millennium Motel'' of cutting-edge demos that
aren't quite ready for market, a keynote speech by
sculptor/mathematician Helaman Ferguson, evening receptions, a 3-D
Web roundup that's something like a demo-by-fire gong show and an
exhibit hall of vendors specializing in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Registration for the entire event costs $760; $630 for SIGGRAPH
members. But there's also an ``exhibits-plus'' registration of $50
that gives access to the exhibit hall, some speeches and other
goodies, and a ``conference select'' registration of $200 that is
at an intermediate level.
</P>
<P>
   For more information about what each level of registration
provides, go to the SIGGRAPH Web site at www.siggraph.org/s99/,
though it's too late to register online. You'll have to do that on
site.

CENSUS ON TRACK, OFFICIAL SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Aided by a cross-country canvass, the Census Bureau
has created a mega-list of 120 million addresses, the first crucial
step in locating and counting every US household in the year 2000,
bureau director Kenneth Prewitt says.
</P>
<P>
   Now all the agency has to do to prepare for an accurate
headcount of an estimated 275 million people is hire 860,000
temporary enumerators in a tight labor market, open 520 offices,
launch a $166 million advertising campaign that Prewitt promised
would be ``culturally sensitive'' and carefully targeted at racial
and ethnic groups, and get Congress to agree to fully fund the
census at $6.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the big picture? That the census is on schedule and
that it is operationally where it needs to be to be in the field
next January and February,'' Prewitt said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   After months of partisan combat on Capitol Hill over how the
bureau should conduct the 2000 Census, Prewitt said he expects the
agency to get the federal funding it needs, including an extra $1.7
billion the Clinton administration recently requested.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Supreme Court ruled that the Census Bureau could
not statistically sample, or estimate, the US population for
purposes of reapportioning the House of Representatives. The
bureau, backed by the White House and congressional Democrats,
wanted to use sampling as a way to reduce census error, which
disproportionately undercounts minorities and children.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said the bureau has redesigned its plan ``to do as full
an enumeration as humanly possible.'' To avoid the 1990 undercount
of 1.6 percent of the population, or about 4.5 million people, he
said, the agency is taking the following steps:
</P>
<P>
   --The bureau has updated Postal Service address lists and is
checking the accuracy of its master list with local officials.
Getting addresses is critical, because census forms are mailed in
March and April to every known residence, and census-takers then
are deployed to every address that does not return a form.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said getting an up-to-date list, which turned out to be
2 million addresses longer than expected, is ``a very major
accomplishment'' because dwellings are constantly being built,
demolished, and changed from single- to multi-family residences.
</P>
<P>
   --The bureau will open 520 field offices across the country over
the next five months, and four vast data-capturing centers are
scheduled to be operational early next year. Using the most
sophisticated scanning technology, the centers would process data
from each census form within 24 hours of its receipt, Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   --The Census Bureau is preparing to launch the largest
public-awareness campaign in its history, and for the first time,
it is using paid advertising to tell people that the census is
confidential and crucial to their communities. Census counts
determine how federal aid is distributed and even where schools,
plants, and shopping centers are built.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said New York advertising giant Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc.,
has the census account, but it has subcontracted part of the work
to four minority firms that will target ``hard-to-count'' Asian,
Hispanic, African-American, and Native American groups. ``We are
trying to be enormously culturally sensitive,'' Prewitt said. He
noted the advertising will be in 24 languages and aimed at
motivating ethnic and minority groups that historically don't
participate in the census, either because they don't understand the
language or don't trust the government.
</P>
<P>
   --Because the response to three census mailings is still
expected to be no better than 61 percent, the bureau plans to hire
more than 860,000 enumerators who starting next spring will knock
on doors for census data. Prewitt said the bureau will try to
attract that size of a labor force wages of $8 to $14 an hour and
the promise of flexible schedules that might appeal to students,
teachers, and retired poeple.
</P>
<P>
   While the bureau is not specifically screening employees for
race and ethnicity, it will ``code'' the attributes of job
applicants and try to match them with the characteristics of the
neighborhoods where they will work, Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to have to find 42 million people,'' Prewitt
said. ``It doesn't mean a black college kid can't handle the
enumeration of a white neighborhood, but it does mean we need to
find the right people to get into a gated community or knows the
language'' spoken in another neighborhood, he said.
</P>
<P>
   J. Kenneth Blackwell, whom Congress appointed as co-chairman of
the US Census Monitoring Board, which oversees the 2000 count, said
it is ``very important to have trusted third parties who live or
work in the community'' as census counters because he does not
expect the advertising campaign to reach many minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Blackwell said, is that the counters hired by the
Census Bureau must pass a long multiple-choice test that requires
literacy, basic math skills, and fairly sophisticated understanding
of privacy rights. In some communities, Blackwell said, only 10
percent of people taking the test have passed it.

 MAC Q&AMP;A: Moving Files To iMac By CD  
 By HENRY NORR   
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: If you're such a Mac expert, how come your column about
moving files from an old Mac to an iMac didn't include the best
solution _ putting the old files on a CD with a CD-R or CD-RW
drive? That's a heck of a lot easier than the complicated
approaches you suggested.
</P>
<P>
   A: The technologies you mention definitely are cool, not just
for the job at hand, but also for lots of others.
</P>
<P>
   A little background: CD-R stands for ``Compact
Disc-Recordable,'' and RW, in this context, stands for
``ReWritable.''
</P>
<P>
   Both technologies let you create compact discs with up to 650
megabytes of your own files on them. CD-R discs are read-only: Once
the files are written, you can't change them. With CD-RW, you can
overwrite files with new versions up to 1,000 times.
</P>
<P>
   Any regular CD-ROM drive, including the one built into the iMac,
can read both CD-R and -RW discs. Then you can simply open the
files or copy them to the new machine's hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   So why didn't I mention these technologies in my July 1 column
on moving files to the iMac? Because CD-R and CD-RW drives, which
generally cost at least $300, still are ``power user'' tools, not
the sort of thing your average Performa user contemplating an iMac
purchase is likely to have around.
</P>
<P>
   And if you don't already have such a drive, buying one to help
with the transition from old Mac to new is a really bad idea.
That's because old Macs work only with SCSI versions of such
drives, but the iMac has no built-in way to connect SCSI
peripherals.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy adapters that make such connections possible, but
they mean extra cost, complexity and, often, compatibility
problems.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if a friend with a SCSI CD-R or -RW drive
will lend it to you, or if you can make it worthwhile for a dealer
or consultant to do the job, putting all your old data on a CD is a
great solution: It not only makes the transition easy, but gives
you a permanent, relatively indestructible backup in case you need
it in the future.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Backup Plan
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm looking for a way to back up the data on my iMac, and a
CD-R or CD-RW drive sounds like a good solution. Are there any that
work with the iMac? And which is better, R or RW?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Clearly, CD writing is the topic of the month! Until recently,
there weren't any CD-R or CD-RW drives for the iMac, but happily
that situation has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies including Sony, APS Technologies and QPS now
offer external CD-R and -RW drives that connect to the iMac's
Universal Serial Bus ports.
</P>
<P>
   They're not cheap (still about $300 or more), and because the
capacity of USBs are limited, they're noticeably slower than
equivalent units for Macs and PCs with SCSI or ATAPI interfaces. On
the other hand, speed usually isn't a critical issue for backup _
just start the operation when you're about to go out or to bed.
</P>
<P>
   Judging between CD-R and CD-RW, I vote for the latter. RW drives
are a bit more expensive but not by much, and they give you more
flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, blank CD-RW discs cost about 10 times as much as the
CD-R variety ($10-$20 each versus just a dollar or two for CD-R).
But you can use the cheaper discs even in a CD-RW drive when you
don't care about rewriting.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Applications and Upgrades
</P>
<P>
   Q: I own a Performa 636, and I'm thinking of upgrading to an
iMac, but neither your July column nor anything else I've read
answers my main question: What about my current applications _ will
they still work, or will I have to replace them all?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: In two words, it depends _ many older programs still will run,
but be prepared to upgrade a lot of them.
</P>
<P>
   There are several issues here. First of all, the older the
application, the greater the odds that it's partially or completely
incompatible with the current Mac OS.
</P>
<P>
   Second, even when old programs run on a new system, they might
not be taking full advantage of it. Your Performa has an old-style
Motorola 68040 chip; the iMac has a PowerPC, a completely different
kind of processor.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac, like other PowerPC-based Macs, can run software
written for the 68040 and its predecessors but only in what's
called ``emulation mode,'' which is relatively slow. To get the
most out of any new Mac, you'll need to upgrade your programs to
``PowerPC-native'' versions, which are written specifically for the
newer chips.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's the question of how to install old programs on
the new machine if they came on floppy disks, because new Macs
don't have floppy drives. Third-party floppy drives connected to
the iMac's USB port work with 1.4-megabyte floppies but won't help
if you have old programs on 800-kilobyte disks.
</P>
<P>
   There are various work-around possibilities, but all in all,
your best bet is to budget for upgrades to current versions of your
main applications. They'll come on CD-ROM or via the Web, both of
which the iMac can handle with aplomb.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Turn Up the Volume
</P>
<P>
   Q: My Power Mac G3, running Mac OS 8.1, regularly loses its
sound settings _ I seem to be resetting the volume almost every
time I start the machine. Any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   A: Unfortunately, that's a fairly common problem, especially
with Mac OS 8.1. Fortunately, a fairly simple fix _ just trashing a
file or two _ often solves it.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the trick: Double-click your System Folder, then the
Preferences folder inside it. Look for a file labeled Monitors &AMP;
Sound Preferences and another called Sound Preferences. (You might
find only the former.) Drag both to the Trash. Restart your Mac.
</P>
<P>
   A general note about Macs that go mute, especially after a
crash: The Volume slider in the Control Strip probably won't solve
the problem. Instead, open the Monitors &AMP; Sound control panel and
uncheck the Mute boxes.

RECOMMENDED SPECS FOR PORTABLE PCS: SOME USERS' REQUIREMENTS MAY
VARY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I very much appreciate your semiannual minimum PC specs
column. I've used it in making hardware purchases and to keep up
with hardware advances. Your column is so helpful that I'm
wondering if you would write a similar column regarding minimum
laptop specs. I am a writer who spends many hours at the keyboard
and would like to practice my craft outside of the office
environment. What minimum specs should I look for in a laptop?
</P>
<P>
   A: The way people use portable computers varies as much as the
way folks use desktops _ maybe more. That makes offering a single
set of recommended specifications for Windows-based portables more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   For example, people who need a portable primarily to check
e-mail and communicate with the office don't need the same kind of
system as those who do sales presentations. And usually those who
already have a desktop system don't need the same kind of machine
as those whose portable is the only machine they use.
</P>
<P>
   _ Processor: If you need a fairly powerful system for
presentations or high-end applications (or even if you just like to
play games in your hotel room at night!), shoot for a 366-megahertz
or faster AMD K-6, Intel Pentium II or Celeron processor. Note that
the Pentium II chips have a significantly greater drain on battery
life than do the older Pentium MMX chips, or some of the K-6 chips.
</P>
<P>
   If you're primarily interested in a computer for communications,
such as e-mail or connecting to a network, you can drop down to the
older Pentium MMX chips that run at 266 and 300 megahertz. These
provide excellent battery life, so they are also a good choice if
you spend a lot of time on airplanes and don't want to keep
swapping batteries.
</P>
<P>
   _ Display: In general, I almost always recommend active-matrix,
or TFT (Thin Film Transistor), color displays. They are much better
than passive-matrix displays, which wash out easily in bright light
and are very slow _ you'll frequently see ``smears'' as things move
on the screen. Although passive-matrix screens are less expensive,
it's worth paying the extra money for an active-matrix display.
</P>
<P>
   The display should also be at least 11 inches, measured
diagonally, with at least two megabytes of video memory.
</P>
<P>
   _ Memory: Notebook memory is usually more expensive than desktop
memory, so upgrading is sometimes a painful proposition. It's
important, then, to get as much memory as you can afford in the
portable you buy _ it'll be cheaper this way than if you add it
later. I would recommend a minimum of 48 megabytes of random access
memory in a portable _ 64 or more if you can afford it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hard drive: Most people don't store as much on a notebook
computer as they do on a desktop, but even so, today's productivity
application suites take up serious space. To accommodate bloatware,
get at least a four-gigabyte hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   _ CD or DVD: I actually think a DVD drive makes more sense on a
portable machine than it does on some desktops. This allows you to
watch DVD movies, either on a plane or in a hotel room, which is an
excellent diversion. If you're a frequent traveler, I'd recommend
the DVD drive. If not, a CD-ROM drive is fine.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ports, etc.: The more ports present on the portable, the
better. On some of the ultraportable, thin-and-light machines,
manufacturers have scrimped by putting ports on an external part
called a replicator. This is just one more part to tote _ or lose.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure the portable has at least one, if not two, PC-card
slots. That's particularly important if it does not have a built-in
modem. If you have only one PC-card slot on an ultraportable, and
it's taken up with a PC-card modem, you're hosed if you want to add
a second PC-card-based device.

BUYING PC ONLINE BRINGS IT FULL CIRCLE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's fitting that one of the most popular items people use their
computers to buy over the Internet is ... other computers. There's
something wonderfully circular about updating your wheezing
compu-clunker with a few clicks of its mouse, and having a shiny
new replacement show up on your doorstep a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   Web sales of PCs are accounting for more and more machine sales.
And why not? Besides the convenience, there's the ability to
customize a machine to fit your needs.
</P>
<P>
   Here are examples of three PCs you can buy online. One's a
low-budget system, the other high-end, and the last is just plain
cool.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dimension L500c, $1,361, Dell Computer Corp.: This is at the
high end of the low-price category for PCs, but it's worth it. This
machine has only one flaw _ its graphics system _ and it's a
significant one. But overall, it's one of the best low-cost
desktops I've seen this year.
</P>
<P>
   The L500c comes with Intel's new 500-megahertz Celeron chip, 64
megabytes of fast memory, a 6.4-gigabyte hard drive, a 40X CD-ROM
drive, a 56K fax modem, Harman Kardon speakers and a 17-inch
monitor. I added an Intel 10/100 Ethernet card to this base
configuration.
</P>
<P>
   As you'd expect, there are no performance complaints with this
system _ it took everything I threw at it. Although it's not quite
as fast as a 500-MHz Pentium III system, it's more than
respectable.
</P>
<P>
   The system is well designed. The case opens simply by pushing
back on a tab, and the side falls away. There are no old-style ISA
slots, just three open PCI slots.
</P>
<P>
   The computer comes with its Intel-based AGP graphics adapter
built into the motherboard, and there's no separate AGP slot if you
want to upgrade to a faster video card. The adapter also uses the
system's RAM for its own memory, but in a unique way. Rather than
having a fixed amount _ say, 2 MB _ it will take what it needs. One
minute you may have 63 MB of system memory available for programs,
and the next minute only 60 MB.
</P>
<P>
   The graphics also are limited to 24-bit color displays. It won't
do 32-bit displays, which means you shouldn't plan on using this
machine if you do high-end graphics work, or if you want 32-bit
color for state-of-the-art games that support it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Aspire 6160, $1,719, Acer America: Acer has made an aggressive
push to sell its home PCs online. There are a variety of models at
different prices, but unfortunately, you can't customize them. Take
'em or leave 'em _ though Acer says the ability to configure your
own is on its way.
</P>
<P>
   The model I tried was the 6150, which has since been replaced by
the 6160. My system had a 500-MHz Pentium III chip, 128 MB of
memory, an eight-GB hard drive, a 4X DVD-ROM drive, a 56K modem and
a 4-MB ATI Rage Pro graphics adapter.
</P>
<P>
   The 6160 improves on this with a 550-MHz Pentium III chip and a
13-GB hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   (The price listed above does not include a monitor. I used a
Dell 1500FP flat panel display, at $949, which has a 15-inch
active-matrix screen. It has an excellent look _ sharp and bright _
and several people here in the office mistook it for a traditional
CRT monitor until they realized how thin it was.)
</P>
<P>
   The Aspire line is aimed at home users, and is one of the few
systems that still has a simplified shell that sits on top of
Windows, allowing fast access to the programs on the computer. The
ACE Desktop is indeed handy, and those who are confused by the
Windows Start button and Explorer may benefit from this.
</P>
<P>
   This computer also makes extensive use of the Universal Serial
Bus. Both the mouse and the keyboard connect via USB ports, and
there are two more open USB ports for other devices.
</P>
<P>
   It's a very fast machine, though the ATI graphics card is a bit
underpowered. Since it sits in an AGP slot, rather than being
soldered to the motherboard, it's easy to upgrade to something more
muscular.
</P>
<P>
   _ Profile, $2,299, Gateway: This is one of several new designs
that are both eye-catching and space-saving, and rely largely on
notebook-PC technology. Indeed, the Profile looks like a notebook
computer perched on a display stand _ and performs like it, too.
</P>
<P>
   It comes with a 400-MHz Advanced Micro Devices K6-2 chip, 64 MB
of memory, a 6.4-GB hard drive, a 2X DVD-ROM drive, a four-MB ATI
Rage LT Pro graphics adapter, a 56K modem, a built-in 10/100
Ethernet adapter and a 15-inch active-matrix flat-panel screen.
Simple speakers are built into the PC's base.
</P>
<P>
   This is an incredibly easy PC to set up. Pull it out of the box,
set it on your desk, plug in the mouse and keyboard and you're good
to go. A snap-off panel in the back masks ports for the modem and
Ethernet connections.
</P>
<P>
   The Profile has a nice, bright display that benefits from the
fact that it doesn't run on batteries. The screen also has a decent
field of view _ you can still see the display even if you are
standing off to the side.
</P>
<P>
   But considering that similarly configured desktop systems sell
for less than half the cost of this, you're paying a premium for
space savings and the coolness factor. You're certainly not paying
for friskiness, because this is no speed demon.
</P>
<P>
   Most notebook computers are not as fast as desktops, even if
their specifications are comparable. There are numerous bottlenecks
in a notebook, ranging from the system bus to the hard drive, that
can cause this. It's the price you pay for portability.
</P>
<P>
   And you also pay the price here, for the sake of a neat design.

REPEAT AFTER ME: THINK, THEN BUY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY  
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I have a PC with a 300-MHz AMD processor with
Windows 98 installed. I click the print button and nothing happens,
so I click it again and still nothing, then I click it a third
time. By then, my printer would start, and I would get three
copies. When I click and drag something, nothing seems to happen
until about three seconds later. When I use Microsoft Word, what I
type doesn't show up until about three seconds later. This problem
has existed since the computer was new. Unfortunately, it was
purchased at a computer show, and the supplier is out of business.
Can you give me a hint as to what my problem is?
</P>
<P>
   _Delayed Reaction
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DELAYED: Yes. You probably spent about three seconds
researching your purchase.
</P>
<P>
   I certainly hope you didn't buy the thing without playing with
it at the show. Such cruddy performance is unacceptable, and you
should have seen that right away. If the guy you dealt with was
legit, he would have refunded your money or fixed the problem,
assuming you were unhappy from the start.
</P>
<P>
   But, all that's academic. You're stuck with a lemon, so let's
make a nice, tall pitcher of lemon daiquiris.
</P>
<P>
   Everything you've mentioned points to a tremendously
underpowered machine. It's trying to do too much with limited
resources, and it falls behind, like a chimpanzee taking the SAT.
Maybe the chip isn't even a 300. Not everybody is as forthrightly
honest and above-board as I am, so maybe this weasel re-labeled the
chip. Regular people don't know the difference, and there's really
no way to tell what speed a chip is without running benchmark
tests. If I didn't know who I was dealing with, that's the first
thing I'd want to see. It may seem rude, but you can afford to be a
lout when it's your bank balance on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Next, I'd check the RAM. Nothing slows down a PC, especially one
running Win98, like inadequate memory. If you have less than 32
megabytes, you're just begging for things to run in slow motion,
especially with something as bloated and RAM-hungry as Word.
Windows juggles a lot of stuff around in memory. When it starts to
run short, it uses space on your hard drive to simulate more, but
that results in another slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   Also, how much stuff is going on at once? Remember that the
microprocessor has to divide its attention between all programs
that are running. It may take it a while to get back to the one
you're expecting instant results from. Close down everything you
don't need. And even if you only have one thing going, remember
that Windows always has a bunch of stuff messing around in the
background. If you hit Control-Alt-Delete, you'll get a list of
everything running. You won't have any idea what most of that stuff
is, but you can try shutting down some of the processes to see if
they're needed or not.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them get loaded automatically. See if any are in your
Startup folder, then dump what you don't need. Others are launched
from a mysterious place deep within Windows called the Registry. In
Win98 you can selectively whack these by going to Run on the Start
menu, then typing in Msconfig (Enter). This kicks up a sweet little
utility that lets you play with your startup procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Well, we live and learn, I suppose. But I admire a guy like you
who's not afraid to take a chance on a bargain. Now, I don't
usually do this, but there's a great little Internet startup I know
I can interest you in. Cash only, please.
</P>

LONDON IS LOGGING ON TO CYBERCAFES  
 ORACLE'S CHAIRMAN BACKS ONLINE VENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Intently pecking away at a keyboard, Jon Woolfson tried to
screen out more than 400 other Internet surfers who packed
Easyeverything, the new super-cybercafe in London's Victoria
district that looks more like a scene from Star Trek than anything
from this galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the cybercafe may be a phenomenon whose
time passed without ever quite arriving. But the cybercafe is alive
and thriving in Britain, and elsewhere in Europe, where home use of
personal computers tends to be lower and the telephone rates for
dial-up modems are typically higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to ask me if this place is a success,'' said
Woolfson, who is 26 and goes to Easyeverything three to four times
a week.
</P>
<P>
   About 7 o'clock one evening last week, a line had formed out the
door and down the street as some five dozen people waited in line
for turns at one of the 400 terminals with high-resolution,
flat-panel screens.
</P>
<P>
   Easyeverything, which opened its first branch on June 21, plans
to open four even bigger cybercafes in central London by the end of
the year, bringing its total number of computer terminals to 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   The operation is the brainchild of Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the
32-year-old founder and chief executive of Easyjet, a low-cost
airline in Europe that has successfully mimicked the no-frills
approach of Southwest Airlines in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   His new venture is a bit like Easyjet. The service is
considerably cheaper than its competitors, charging 1 pound ($1.61)
an hour for Internet access, compared with five or six times that
price at smaller cybercafes in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most cybercafes are run by nerds for nerds,'' Haji-Ioannou
said. ``The only way for me to bring down the price was to do it
for the masses. The secret is the scale.''

   Oracle's Chairman Backs Online Venture
</P>
<P>
   With an investment of a few million dollars in the start-up
company Netledger, Lawrence Ellison is putting his money where his
mouth is _ and he has plenty of both, it could be argued.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison is worth $12 billion, as a founder, chairman and largest
shareholder in Oracle Corp., a leading database software maker. And
he has been an outspoken advocate of Web-based services as
representing the future of software _ the antithesis of Microsoft
Corp.'s program-on-every-desktop, PC-centric model of computing.
</P>
<P>
   Netledger, of Menlo Park, Calif., is hoping to convert the
market for accounting software used by small businesses into a Web
service. Netledger plans to charge small businesses a base fee of
$4.95 a month for the service, which will hold all their accounts
receivable, payable and general ledger records. They will tap into
the Netledger Web site, which is powered by Oracle's database
software, naturally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be the Yahoo of accounting software and a beacon for
other companies _ to not build software for Windows but for the
Web,'' Ellison explained. He added that Netledger was focusing on a
market that Oracle had no intention of entering.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison is also betting on a former colleague, Evan Goldberg,
the 33-year-old president of Netledger, who is a former Oracle vice
president. In small-business accounting software, Netledger is
taking on a rival with a Microsoft-size market share: Intuit Inc.
and its Quickbooks product. ``It's a Quickbooks market out there _
no question about it,'' Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Intuit's Quickbooks line, like so many PC products, is
increasingly adding Web features. But Netledger believes that its
``pure Internet'' model will prove an advantage over Intuit's PC
legacy.

NEW COMPANY OFFERS TOTAL OUTSOURCING OF COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For every small business owner who has struggled
with personal computers that crash, printers that won't print and
networks that don't network, Sheldon Laube says he has the answer.
His new company, Centerbeam Inc., will offer complete outsourcing
of information technology, all for a single monthly per-user fee.
</P>
<P>
   Laube, the co-founder of U.S. Web Inc. and former chief
technology officer for Novell Inc. and Price Waterhouse, said
Centerbeam would offer the first truly ``free'' PC, as in free of
hassles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea is you don't buy computers anymore,'' said
Laube, who intends to announce Centerbeam's plans on Monday. ``You
buy a service from us and we buy all the pieces and worry about
making them work.''
</P>
<P>
   For the monthly per-user fee of $165, customers get PCs loaded
with Microsoft Corp.'s forthcoming Windows 2000 operating system,
the Microsoft Office suite of applications, a wireless network
using equipment from Lucent Technologies Inc., and a fast link to
Centerbeam and the Internet using a type of high-speed telephone
connection known as digital subscriber line, or DSL. Centerbeam
will provide remote management and service, including backing up
all data every day, and automatic software upgrades. The personal
computers will be upgraded at least every two years.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the venture gains credibility from the track record
of Laube, who directed the first major installation of Lotus Notes
for Price Waterhouse, and who helped U.S. Web _ now known as US
Web/CKS _ create its business of providing Internet technology and
marketing services on a contract basis. But they said it might be a
tough sell to companies that already had substantial investments in
information technology unless Centerbeam can show clear evidence of
cost savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the large-account market, we've seen a clear trend toward
technology being treated almost as a utility, and this brings that
cost-per-seat model to small accounts,'' said Charles Smulders, an
analyst with Dataquest. ``I think there will be a period of concept
testing, and it will be very important for Centerbeam to use
companies as evidence of the worth of their offering.''
</P>
<P>
   Based in Santa Clara, Calif., Centerbeam raised $20 million in
its first round of venture capital. Investors included Crosspoint
Venture Partners, Accell Partners, New Enterprise Associates,
Microsoft and US Web/CKS. Laube said he was in negotiations with a
major personal computer manufacturer to be the exclusive supplier
of hardware, and that the service would commence as soon as
Microsoft makes Windows 2000 available, which is expected this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Laube said Centerbeam would not have been possible without
Windows 2000, which promises to be much more stable than previous
Microsoft operating systems, or without inexpensive PCs, wireless
networking and digital subscriber lines. ``The key is the pieces
have all come into place,'' he said. ``That's why this is the
moment.''

PATENTS: AUCTIONING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aficionados of eBay, one of the most popular and successful
commercial sites on the Internet, often spend hours scrolling
through lists of items offered for sale there, submitting bids for
antiques, computer equipment, art, furniture and even cars. But so
far, no one has tried to auction any intellectual property _
patents, trademarks or copyrights _ on the vast site.
</P>
<P>
   Like the seller with a closet full of Elvis dolls or a cherry
1957 Chevy convertible, independent inventors own a piece of
property that many of them would like to sell outright or license
to someone who can turn a patented idea into a tangible product.
But most independent inventors flounder when it comes to getting a
patent into the hands of the right investor or manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that while independent inventors may have
a special idea born of a specific profession, skill or hobby, they
frequently lack business, manufacturing or marketing know-how.
</P>
<P>
   They usually take the first step of contacting the biggest
manufacturers in their field, hoping that their invention can be
licensed and added to the company's product line. That's when they
learn their first hard lesson _ manufacturers are often reluctant
to embrace ideas from outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   EBay, though, has demonstrated that buyers can find sellers when
people from around the country or the world come together
electronically, and that has inspired copycat Web sites. Borrowing
from the eBay model, a Texas entrepreneur and inveterate inventor
has started a similar Internet auction clearinghouse for
intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   The inventor, Brian Donzis, has faced the ``what next?'' hurdle
that stymies many others. Donzis holds 200 patents for innovations
ranging from construction equipment to immune-system drugs to
tennis-court designs.
</P>
<P>
   One of his biggest successes came in 1977, after he bribed his
way into the hospital room of Dan Pastorini, the injured Houston
Oilers quarterback, and persuaded him to try a protective vest he'd
patented. Donzis sold his vest to the National Football League, and
the rest is rags-to-riches history. Since then, he has made the
patenting and marketing of inventions his life's work, and passion.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that most independent inventors don't have the
nerve, opportunity or foresight to barge into a hospital room,
Donzis hopes to eliminate the need for those circumstances with a
2-month old Web site called PatentAuction.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife is the reason I got into auctioning,'' said Donzis,
67, who lives in San Antonio. ``She got into eBay, and I saw the
excitement among people all over the world in affinity groups who
were in contact with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I had spent so much time beating my brains out
finding a way to let people know what I had, to make a product or
sell a license, that I got interested in the Web as a way to
communicate my stuff and then everybody else's stuff all over the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   PatentAuction's home page bills it as ``a comprehensive online
auction for buying, selling or licensing intellectual property;
patents, patent applications, technical know-how, trade secrets,
trademarks, copyrights, music, art, registered domain names and
more.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first pages on the site is the Intellectual Property
Catalog, which the site ballyhoos as ``the California gold rush,
the diamond mines of South Africa and the Alaskan oil boom all
rolled into one.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, it is something less than any of those. Recently, the
database offered 90 categories of inventions listing 255 patents
for auction.
</P>
<P>
   The descriptions were so brief as to be of little use to an
interested buyer: A patent for a wireless color camera, for
example, was described only as a ``low-cost wireless color camera,
utilizing new CMOS camera technology.'' There was no definition of
CMOS technology for the uninitiated, and no further explanation of
why this particular camera was innovative enough to win a patent
and pique the interest of investors.
</P>
<P>
   A random look at other listings found that they all skimped on
detail, and many had spelling or grammatical errors, too.
</P>
<P>
   But Donzis said that a patent for a pharmaceutical product and
another for an athletic shoe have already been sold through
Patent-Auction, and that eight more involving kitchenware, toys,
medical and cigarette products were ``in the transition stage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of inventors are very, very cautious about going
online,'' Donzis said in explaining the inadequate patent
descriptions submitted by sellers. ``I'm not thrilled with the way
it looks now. But most of them said they'd put out a brief
description, and if someone signs up and wants to talk to them,
they'll provide more. We're trying to convince them to show the
patent and provide more details. But we just got started, and I
think people will relax as they see things moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Each patent listing is followed by a form allowing interested
buyers to submit a bid. Bidders must first register with the site;
they get a user name and a password. Winning bidders pay
PatentAuction a buyer's premium of 15 percent on purchases up to
$50,000 and 10 percent on anything higher.
</P>
<P>
   The site cautions that bids of more than $100,000 ``require a
financial authorization form,'' but the form included asks only for
a name, street and e-mail addresses, phone and Social Security
numbers, birth date and a signature.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers are charged a ``display package fee'' that is
automatically credited to the commission they must also pay if a
patent sells. The commission can be hefty _ 20 percent for patents
sold for $2,000 or less, 15 percent on sales up to $7,500, and 10
percent on sales up to $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The display fee ranges from $195 to $595, and buys the seller a
180-day posting on the site. If the patent idea does not sell in
that time, the posting can be renewed for six months, free of
charge. The costlier fees include extra pages on the site for
additional descriptions of the patent or graphics, and translation
into one or two foreign languages.
</P>
<P>
   The site assures buyers and sellers that ``PatentAuction
facilitates the tedious aspects of technology transfer,'' promising
that a certified check or credit-card charge will be deposited into
``an escrow account managed by a well-known international
intellectual-property law firm.''
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, Donzis says he does not just post the patent on the
Web site. He also e-mails the listing to U.S. embassies around the
world through an agreement with the Commerce Department to
encourage the export of intellectual property, and to a roster of
Web sites and databases that he believes represent interested
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   He also offers consulting services for inventors who need help
with business plans, financing, industrial design, building
prototypes, or marketing and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we'd have more sellers than buyers, but we have a
lot more buyers, maybe 20-to-1,'' Donzis said. He adds patents
every day, he said, and remains optimistic. At the bottom of each
page of PatentAuction, he has added a caveat: ``This site and its
method of doing business are patent pending.''
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent
and Trademark Office, Washington DC 20231.

<P>
   Back then, it was a political statement; today, it's a health
statement. Middle age and affluence are hitting baby boomers at the
same time, benefiting the all-natural-food industry. Organics and
natural foods are flowing into mainstream supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Boomers remember granola and yogurt and herbal teas from their
college hippie days. And although whole foods have long had a place
with the Birkenstocks and mantra crowd, today's consumer is more
likely to drive a Suburban than a VW bus.
</P>
<P>
   Organics and natural foods are flowing into mainstream
supermarkets. And the meaning of ``natural'' has morphed to include
exotics: cheeses, butters and fish and varieties of vegetables we
only read about 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Older, more sophisticated shoppers want to buy Saint Johnswort,
but they also want to buy triple cream St. Andre cheese. Younger
shoppers who can afford it also want it both ways: hip and
healthful.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. sales of organic and all-natural foods have grown by 15
percent to 25 percent annually for the past seven years. Today,
more than 10,000 U.S. farms produce organic/natural crops and
livestock, according to the Organic Farming Research Foundation.
And these products are being snapped up by consumers who, in the
main, make more than $50,000 a year and are 45 and older, according
to SPINS, an independent natural-products information source.
</P>
<P>
   When Cheerios maker General Mills rolls out an organic option to
all those sugar-pumped floaters, you know organic groceries are
going mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Sunrise Cereal slipped into the General Mills tide this summer,
and it won't be the last of its kind, at least in marketing trials.
</P>
<P>
   The steady growth of the organic market isn't the near
panic-driven demand generated in the 1980s by a string of
food-safety scares that included actress Meryl Streep on ``60
Minutes'' challenging the use of alar, a ripening agent. That event
led to near disaster for the apple industry.
</P>
<P>
   And although the growth of the market is consistent, organics
still represent a small fraction of grocery sales in the country,
at least in part because of their higher prices: Whereas an
increasing organic supply has narrowed the price gap between
organic and conventional fare, the difference in price remains
large enough to favor higher-income shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, grocers see a gradual greening in the diet of the
American consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last two to three years, momentum has begun to build in
the organic food area,'' Tom Thumb spokeswoman Connie Yates said in
a prepared statement. ``Sales of organic foods in all categories
are definitely on the increase. By the year 2001, organic products
are projected to command 5 percent of total food sales in the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The awareness is what's rising,'' said Doug White, produce
director for Minyard Food Stores' three chains: Minyard, Carnival
and Sack'N Save.
</P>
<P>
   None of the mainstream supermarkets has matched the
certified-organic and all-natural inventory found at specialty
stores such as Austin-based Whole Foods Markets, the nation's No. 1
natural-foods chain, or Boulder, Colo.-based Wild Oats Markets, or
H.E. Butt Grocery Co.'s three Central Market stores in Austin and
San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Among mainstream grocers, Tom Thumb based in Dallas was once the
Metroplex leader for certified organic produce and all-natural
alternatives, and Yates said its storewide organics variety has
continued to expand.
</P>
<P>
   Albertson's, already the Metroplex leader in overall grocery
market share, has more recently taken the mainstream lead for
adding varieties and carrying consistent supplies. The Boise,
Idaho-based chain's certified-organic and all-natural lineups
include fresh produce, dried spices, canned and frozen foods, dairy
items, snacks and other packaged items, and meats and poultry.
</P>
<P>
   And Kroger's Southwest division has been revving up its own
reformation _ adding 16- to 24-foot sections devoted to certified
organic produce in 44 of its 62 Metroplex supermarkets since spring
1998, said Gary Huddleston, division consumer affairs manager.
</P>
<P>
   Like an increasing number of competitors, Kroger is also
carrying ``additive-free'' or ``all-natural'' lines of beef,
chicken and pork.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our organic baby foods is one category doing extremely well,''
Huddleston said, citing both nonrefrigerated versions and a new
frozen line of certified organic baby foods.
</P>
<P>
   The New Organics Co. based in Massachusetts has also been
gradually capturing space on the canned and packaged grocery aisles
of many area supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Winn-Dixie Texas based in Fort Worth, for example, is stocking
New Organics mustards, preserves and other canned and packaged
foods in 45 of its 73 Texas and Oklahoma stores, said Pat West,
Winn-Dixie's regional marketing director.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   The surge of organic foods into mainstream markets in North
Texas can be explained in large part because of increasing numbers
of suppliers: more demand, more supply.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, more and more categories of organic and natural foods
are becoming widely available, said Jeff Lang, Albertson's North
Texas Division grocery sales manager.
</P>
<P>
   Less than three years ago, Albertson's ``organic'' merchandising
amounted to a few selected stores featuring maybe three to eight
certified organic items in 4-foot spaces dwarfed by the produce
departments. Today, each Albertson's store _ including 113 in its
North Texas Division _ carries a minimum of 25 certified organic
produce items, and many locations offer 38 to 45, said Gary
Barnett, the division's produce sales manager. Those items are
dispersed throughout the produce department rather than being
relegated to a solitary corner. In fact, all of Albertson's organic
items are scattered throughout the store rather than being
segregated into an organics section, flagged by signs identifying
them as organic.
</P>
<P>
   Minyard's White notes that his stores are just beginning to show
a similar burgeoning variety of whole foods. Although supply and
demand vary widely from store to store, some locations in the
Minyard chain carry as many as 30 to 40 certified organic produce
items, as well as increasing organic options in canned, frozen and
dairy foods.
</P>
<P>
   The grocer, based in Coppell, Texas, is even stocking some
organic produce that has yet to turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking toward the future,'' White said of the chain's
commitment to organic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Which seems fairly natural.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The marquee stars of the government's antitrust assault on the
Microsoft Corp. have been David Boies, the trial lawyer who proved
a master at catching Microsoft witnesses off-guard, and Joel Klein,
the chief of the Justice Department's antitrust division.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the outcome of the government's case _ win or lose _ will
largely hinge on whether the federal courts are impressed by the
work and judgment of Phillip R. Malone.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-year-old senior staff lawyer in the Justice Department's
San Francisco office led the agency's investigation of the software
powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   It was Malone and his San Francisco team of ``hawks'' on the
Microsoft issue, according to people involved in case, who strongly
urged Washington to file a major antitrust suit against the
company. After internal debate and review, Klein eventually agreed
with the San Francisco recommendation and the Justice Department
sued Microsoft in May 1998, joined by 20 states.
</P>
<P>
   Then, before the start of the trial in October, Malone managed
the campaign to add new evidence to the case and crisscrossed the
country taking dozens of new depositions. He also coordinated the
government's trial preparation, a painstaking effort that paid off
repeatedly in the courtroom during the eight months of witness
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case that has been presented is Phil Malone's case,''
Boies observed. ``Take Phil and his San Francisco staff, and this
case could have progressed without anyone else _ and that includes
me. It may not have been quite as dramatic in the courtroom, but
the case would have been the same.''
</P>
<P>
   The next step in the Microsoft case occurs Tuesday, when each
side presents the court with its ``proposed findings of fact.''
These amount to legal storytelling, as each side presents its view
of the facts established in the trial citing witness testimony,
e-mail or documents. And they will be tomes; though still being
edited at the end of last week, the government draft was nearly 800
pages, and Microsoft's was about 250 pages.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence cited will not be new. But these documents are
efforts by both sides to organize and present the evidence to Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson, giving him a source book and a lens for
viewing the case. The two sides, of course, will present very
different views. And there is more to come, with both sides
scheduled to submit revised findings of fact next month.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, once again, is at the center of things. He and his San
Francisco team found the facts the government is presenting as
evidence, while Microsoft is rebutting them as hearsay, irrelevant
or inconsequential in an antitrust case. Even Microsoft concedes
that its witnesses got roughed up and occasionally embarrassed by
Boies during the trial. But with the focus now turning to a cool
assessment of the testimony, evidence and law, Microsoft's legal
team insists that the advantage is shifting to their side.
</P>
<P>
   In short, they much prefer opposing Malone's case on paper than
opposing Boies in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good theater in the courtroom, but the government left
vast portions of our direct testimony untouched,'' said William
Neukom, Microsoft's general counsel. ``And this is our opportunity
to tell our story based on the unchallenged facts in the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft story is that contrary to the government's
allegations, it has not illegally used the market muscle derived
from its control of desktop personal computer software to stifle
the challenge from Internet software. Consumers, Microsoft said,
benefited from its decision to fold Internet browsing software into
its industry-standard Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The government's view was perhaps most cogently expressed by a
senior Justice Department official in the hallway of the federal
court building in June. After a morning of testimony about
Microsoft's reported arm-twisting tactics, the official told a
colleague, ``If that stuff isn't illegal, we should shut down the
Justice Department.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone was largely responsible for making that the received
wisdom within the Justice Department _ though, of course, the
policy decisions are not made by the staff but by the top
appointees in the antitrust division, Klein and A. Douglas Melamed,
the second in command.
</P>
<P>
   With the case still pending, Malone will not discuss the
investigation in detail. But he did say that it was the
accumulation of evidence _ and not any single episode or document _
that persuaded him that Microsoft had gone too far. ``It was the
mountain of evidence, all those Microsoft e-mails keep coming back
over and over again to the same theme,'' Malone said. ``Its own
documents make it very clear that Microsoft knew what it was doing
_ protecting its monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Malone is regarded within the Justice Department as one of the
top staff lawyers in the antitrust division. Colleagues describe
him as soft-spoken, focused and driven. He grew up the son of a
railway technician in Thoreau, N.M., a rail stop and logging town
of 500 people at the time, and then made his way to Harvard
University as an undergraduate, before getting his law degree at
the University of Arizona and joining the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   He seems to thrive on a grueling work regimen. During the course
of the Microsoft investigation, Malone would often be called back
for one-day meetings at Justice Department headquarters in
Washington. His routine, colleagues said, was to work the day in
San Francisco, take the overnight flight to Washington, work the
day in Washington, take the red-eye that night back to San
Francisco and show up early for work the next day. Klein calls
Malone the antitrust unit's Cal Ripken, referring to the ironman
infielder for the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, who is single, bought a house in San Francisco last
August. But the moving boxes remain mostly unpacked, since he has
been back to see it only three times on brief visits, he said,
because he has spent the last year in Washington for the trial.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Since he took over the Microsoft inquiry in 1996, Malone has
pursued the company with an intensity and stamina others find
remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Varney, a lawyer who worked for Netscape
Communications, recalled Malone asking for a briefing from software
engineers on how Microsoft melded its browser into the Windows
operating system. The Silicon Valley session in the fall of 1997,
Ms. Varney recalled, began late in the day and lasted eight hours,
with Malone quizzing the programmers with detailed questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was astounded by his depth of knowledge of the technology
and the industry,'' Ms. Varney said.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft legal team is also impressed by Malone as a
hard-working investigator. But they said that his knowledge of the
industry had been a one-sided tutorial administered by Microsoft's
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There is a genuine cultural divide between the Justice
Department's staff lawyers, like Malone, and the Microsoft legal
team from Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell, an elite law firm. The culture gap _
different worlds of affluence and attitudes _ add a certain edge to
their confrontation. Members of the private firm are the ones with
the half-million-dollar-a-year partners' salaries, who ride in the
front of the plane, wear expensive suits and stay at four-star
hotels. Malone is paid about $100,000 a year and while in
Washington rents a room with a kitchen. But he said he has never
regretted not taking the more lucrative path in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I love doing,'' he said. ``You take a case,
investigate it and file it because it is the right thing to do, not
because some client paid you.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As the government's walking encyclopedia of the Microsoft case,
Malone also plays a key role in the occasional settlement talks
between the two sides. ``You don't want to have detailed settlement
talks without Phil in the room because he's the one who really
understands things,'' one person involved in the case said.
</P>
<P>
   If no settlement emerges and the trial concludes, the appeals
process could take two years or more. By then, Klein, a political
appointee, and Boies, a renowned litigator hired to present the
case against Microsoft, will most likely have moved on, legal
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the whole group, the guy who will still be around in two
years or so will probably be Phil Malone,'' said William Kovacic, a
law professor at George Washington University.

<P>
   As AT&AMP;T Corp., the nation's biggest telephone company, has
marched into the cable television business, it has found itself
locked in a battle of legal briefs, lobbying salvos and public
relations campaigns against America Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over ``open access'' to AT&AMP;T's cable systems has raged
in local communities from Broward County, Fla., to Portland, Ore.,
and America Online, the nation's largest gateway to cyberspace, has
consistently argued that AT&AMP;T must let Internet carriers link
directly to AT&AMP;T's cable systems. Such connections would bypass
communications systems and Web services developed by
Excite(AT)Home, an Internet-over-cable company that is backed by
many big cable television players _ including AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   All along this battlefront, AT&AMP;T has taken an adamant stance:
Because it is investing billions to upgrade its cable networks to
carry Internet data, AT&AMP;T has argued that it should have exclusive
right to determine how those systems are used for Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the scenes, a side deal may now be in the works _ one
that could eventually undermine Excite(AT)Home's business model.
According to executives close to the companies, AT&AMP;T and America
Online are considering an arrangement that would diminish the role
of Excite(AT)Home by giving America Online and perhaps other
Internet providers enhanced access to AT&AMP;T's systems. Such a deal
could be more than politically expedient; it would enable AT&AMP;T and
America Online each to tap the technical and marketing strengths of
the other.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T and America Online declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The competitive dynamics of the market place and the industry's
strategic landscape make a compelling case for America Online and
AT&AMP;T to approach the digital future as partners rather than foes.
After all, America Online already has 18 million Internet
subscribers, and AT&AMP;T owns or has agreements to acquire cable
systems with 16 million customers, although AT&AMP;T plans to sell some
systems.
</P>
<P>
   For Excite(AT)Home, the potentially unsettling implications of
such an arrangement became evident about two weeks ago, when its
board convened just before the company staged its first conference
for financial analysts since the merger in May of At Home Corp. and
Excite Inc.
</P>
<P>
   C. Michael Armstrong, AT&AMP;T's chairman and an Excite(AT)Home
director, voiced concern that At Home's business of using cable
modems to link consumers to the Internet might not be a great
strategic fit with Excite's Web portal service, according to a
person at the meeting. Armstrong, arguing from the strength of
AT&AMP;T's 58 percent voting stake in Excite(AT)Home, said that it
might make more sense for At Home to focus on delivering high-speed
communications links, while exploring a sale or spin-off of
Excite's Web content business, this person said.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's view is anathema to the Excite(AT)Home management
team and to the venture capitalists from Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP;
Byers who helped build the former At Home. They contend that the
company cannot thrive as simply a ``dumb pipe.'' Instead, they want
to leverage the communications system built by At Home to provide a
rich information and entertainment package offered by the combined
Excite(AT)Home that would directly compete with America Online _
from the customer's mouse to the farthest reaches of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is to execute, so we have as many users as possible
and have built as strong as possible a brand relationship with them
so that those people are loyal Excite(AT)Home customers,'' Thomas
Jermoluk, Excite(AT)Home's chairman, said.
</P>
<P>
   But AT&AMP;T has said it does not want to be in the so-called
content business. And even though Excite(AT)Home has built an
extensive network and has signed up more than 600,000 cable modem
customers across the country, in the grand scheme of the
communications business, AT&AMP;T does not really need Excite(AT)Home.
</P>
<P>
   The former At Home's early cable partners _ which included
Tele-Communications Inc., the cable giant now owned by AT&AMP;T _
invested shortly after At Home was founded in 1995 to develop
systems for delivering Internet data at high speed over cable
wires.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for At Home's developing the technology and related
Web content, the cable companies contributed money and granted At
Home exclusive deals for the Internet-access rights to their
systems, generally for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   At AT&AMP;T, it was only after Armstrong created management
stability by taking over as chairman in 1997 that the company
seemed to develop a coherent long-term plan, one meant to reassert
its primacy in the communications business, especially with
residential consumers. Stymied in its attempts to merge with the
regional Bell company SBC Communications Inc. and unsatisfied with
leasing local telephone access from phone companies, AT&AMP;T began
unspooling its cable strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer AT&AMP;T announced its $31.8 billion deal to acquire TCI
and later agreed to acquire Mediaone Group Inc. for an additional
$58 billion. By acquiring TCI, AT&AMP;T inherited not only the largest
stake in At Home but also the agreement to give At Home exclusive
Internet use of its cable systems into the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   By the time AT&AMP;T completed its acquisition of TCI this year, At
Home had already agreed to acquire Excite, the big Web portal
service. From At Home's perspective, adding Excite's Web content
would enable the company to offer a full package of services to
compete against America Online. But from AT&AMP;T's perspective, the
Excite acquisition, coupled with the existing At Home exclusivity
arrangement, seemed to pose yet another strategic restraint,
according to people close to the company.
</P>
<P>
   For AT&AMP;T, the main enemy is not America Online _ as it is for
Excite(AT)Home. Instead, AT&AMP;T's main competition is posed by the
Baby Bell local phone giants.
</P>
<P>
   A prime motive for AT&AMP;T's entering the cable business was that
the Bells are intent on getting into the long-distance phone
business and eviscerating AT&AMP;T. At the same time, the Bells are
belatedly deploying a high-speed Internet technology for telephone
networks called digital subscriber line, or DSL. As a counterforce,
AT&AMP;T wants to use its cable lines to deliver local phone service,
as well as long-distance, digital TV and high-speed Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   That is where America Online comes in. Its 18 million customers
give the company a far bigger market share than any other Internet
provider and a clientele that is presumably in a better position to
appreciate the benefits of a high-speed service than people who
have not yet ventured online.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To AT&AMP;T, therefore, a deal with America Online might seem a good
way to increase penetration of cable modem service. And once a
customer took AT&AMP;T cable television service and some sort of AT&AMP;T
cable modem service, that might make them a much easier target for
the big-money local and long-distance phone services that will
travel over those same cables.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Excite(AT)Home contends that greater market
penetration is not an issue because the pent-up demand for cable
Internet service already exceeds the supply of Internet-ready cable
systems. ``We're a long way from being a demand-limited system,''
Jermoluk said. ``We have 38 million registered Excite users. You
think we have any problem generating demand?''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, from America Online's perspective, it may make
sense to cut a deal with AT&AMP;T, rather than to continue waging a
political war that might drive AT&AMP;T into a wholehearted commitment
to the full-service concept of Excite(AT)Home.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts say it is highly unlikely that AT&AMP;T and
American Online could strike a major deal until Excite(AT)Home's
exclusivity pact expires. And unless that exclusive arrangement is
overturned by the courts before then, AT&AMP;T cable customers will
probably still have to pay $9.95 a month if they want cable-modem
access to America Online _ on top of the $40 cable-modem customers
generally pay for Excite(AT)Home, 65 percent of which goes to the
cable partner.
</P>
<P>
   In order for America Online to work cooperatively with AT&AMP;T
while it is still under obligation to Excite(AT)Home, all parties
would probably have to accept less money from each customer.
</P>
<P>
   And after Excite(AT)Home's exclusivity pact with AT&AMP;T runs out?
It would be foolish for AT&AMP;T to totally turn its back on the
national Internet network that At Home developed and to forswear
use of At Home's technology for managing local networks. And for
America Online, it might make economic sense to lease access to
that technology, rather than spend money duplicating it all.
</P>
<P>
   The issue, in the end, is content _ whether AT&AMP;T cable-modem
customers will get America Online's gateway to chat rooms, e-mail,
e-commerce, news and information, or use the Excite(AT)Home-brand
portal to many of the same kinds of offerings out on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   It is the portal piece of the network where the Excite content
business could end up perhaps the biggest loser in this epic battle
for cable access. In the end, even Jermoluk of Excite(AT)Home may
have little choice but to go along with whatever course is set by
the AT&AMP;T chairman, Michael Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike's goal is to maximize the total number of subscribers on
his system by whatever means at his disposal,'' Jermoluk said.
``The only way we have to win is to make AT&AMP;T successful doing what
it is that they're doing.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Investing in Internet stocks is like building a beautiful
hilltop mansion _ one that just happens to sit right on the San
Andreas Fault. It's hard to enjoy the view when every time you hear
a noise, you wonder whether this might be the big one.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the most minor rumblings among Internet companies _
fears of slow sales growth over the summer and increased price
competition for Internet service providers _ has lead to extreme
drops in the price of most Internet shares in recent weeks. Even
the most bullish Net investors paused, ever so briefly, to wonder
about the strength of their foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Thestreet.com's index of the stock prices of major Internet
companies fell by 25 percent over the last month, and is now 37
percent below its peak in April. And while prices appeared to
stabilize at the end of last week, the volatility shows how much
this very prominent part of the market is dependent on the psyches
of a relatively small number of investors.
</P>
<P>
   Sentiment, of course, is always an important factor in stock
prices. But most of the time there are some checks and balances.
With mature companies, like banks or oil refiners, stock trading
reflects an ongoing debate over the company's market and strategy,
and prices generally stay in a predictable range. As optimism
wanes, value investors eventually scoop up bargains.
</P>
<P>
   There is no plausible case for value investing in ethereal
Internet shares. The Warren Buffet wannabes are not looking at
Yahoo, whose share price of $126.9375 on Friday stood at 260 times
earnings, and saying to themselves that it was an underappreciated
bargain, now that its multiple was down from 550 in April.
</P>
<P>
   People with a ``better safe than sorry'' attitude will neither
live in earthquake zones in California nor invest in most of the
technology companies situated there.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet shares do not even have the modest restraint
provided to other rapidly growing technology companies by short
sellers. The bears who shorted Internet stocks got burned long ago
and moved to more predictable ground.
</P>
<P>
   No. The prices of Internet stocks are simply a Rorschach test
that measures the mix of hope and fear in the minds of a small
group of investors who are willing to soar without a safety net.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is changing everything, the bullish argument goes,
with some justification. And the companies that wind up as the
leaders of the wired world will have value beyond our wildest
imagination, goes the somewhat more arguable corollary.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Benjamin, the well-wired analyst with BancBoston Robertson
Stephens, articulated the Net-bull philosophy when he declared in a
report that he would buy the shares of Internet companies he liked
regardless of any calculation of value.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found it is particularly difficult to use absolute or
relative valuation metrics as a tool to pick near-term bottoms and
tops,'' he wrote in a newsletter to clients. ``Instead, we try to
remain somewhat disciplined about accumulating stocks based on
improving fundamentals.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the financial news and analysis service Thestreet.com
conducted an unscientific poll of its audience of active traders.
Only 14 percent said, ``The end is near _ sell.'' Another 27
percent said, ``The end is near _ buy.'' But 48 percent checked the
very cynical choice, ``Waiting for the blowout to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a bullish technical indicator at least in the short run,
as it indicates that the boundless optimism of Internet investors
remains intact. But if that enthusiasm wanes, even slightly, the
drops could be sharp.
</P>
<P>
   So what will feed or starve Internet investor optimism?
</P>
<P>
   To start with, the fundamental picture does, in fact, keep
getting better and better. More people are going online, doing more
things, seeing more ads and _ most important _ buying more. The
rapid fall of computer prices _ to nearly free, for those who
commit to three years of Internet service _ is bringing millions of
new people online. And the same trends are occurring in much of the
rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The thesis that the leading companies will get the lion's share
of the spoils in the new world has proved true so far. The
continued success of America Online, Yahoo and Amazon.com has
shamed skeptics who said that the fact that anyone can offer a
product or service online meant that the cheapest price would
always win.
</P>
<P>
   But does that mean that the shares of these companies will rise
to infinite values? There are a number of forces that could well
challenge the resolve of the Internet's biggest fans.
</P>
<P>
   One is the immutable law of supply and demand. In response to
investor hunger for the Internet, Wall Street has served up an
astounding number of initial public stock offerings over the last
year. These Internet issues soaked up some of the dollars that
would otherwise have bid the prices of existing stocks even higher.
As it becomes clearer which are the flunk-outs of the IPO class of
'99, some investors may expel them from their portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a number of professional money managers who missed
the big run-ups in Net stocks are now deleting their spreadsheets
and buying into the purported New Blue Chips in order to bring
their performance to something close to the market averages. But it
remains to be seen if these investors' conversion to the new math
was thorough enough to stand it if times get tough.
</P>
<P>
   Investors may look more at profits as revenue growth begins to
slow among the Internet leaders. The law of large numbers, after
all, says that even the most successful companies can't triple
their sales each year indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, some of the companies may encounter difficulties
meeting the ambitious growth forecasts that the analysts have
published to back up their recommendations. There is a lot of
multiplication behind these numbers. Projected sales are based on
growth in the Internet, multiplied by the propensity of people to
use whatever the company's service, multiplied by the company's
projected market share. It doesn't take much slippage in any of
these numbers to make a sales projection for the year 2002 drop by
25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And so what happens if investors start to question their visions
of infinite growth? There are certainly signs that an increasing
number of new investors are buying Internet stocks on margin _ on
credit, in effect _ and that sharp drops could cause a cascading
series of margin calls, and further price declines, as such
investors are forced to settle their accounts. Analysts say that it
was just such margin-related selling that partially fueled the Net
stock decline in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And next time, that rumbling noise outside the picture window
may be more than a summer thunderstorm.

A few precautions can keep your computer humming 
By Bill Husted  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I liked home computers best when they were totally
useless beasts.
</P>
<P>
   After all, when my Altair computer _ one that I put together
from a kit and that used toggle switches instead of a keyboard _
acted up (and it did that with the frequency of a spoiled
12-year-old), nothing important was affected. About all I did with
that computer was play a game called ``Life'' that involved
watching tiny dots multiply and then disappear _ by flipping the
toggle switches in just the right combination _ on the screen of
the 13-inch GE TV that I used as a monitor.
</P>
<P>
   I saw how much things had changed this weekend when my home
computer screwed up for reasons that I still do not understand.
</P>
<P>
   In one fell swoop, I lost the ability to exchange e-mails with a
retired nun whom I know very well but have never met; I could no
longer work on the book that I'll never finish; and I was barred
from the only computer game that I play anymore _ an electronic
version of canasta.
</P>
<P>
   Probably you are in the same boat _ you'd miss your computer if
it became an expensive beige paperweight. All electronic devices
are born to die, but there are some really easy things you can do
to postpone that day. So, for today, let's take a look at how to
keep your computer healthy.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, let's get to know two small programs that come
with Windows _ Scan Disk and Defrag _ that provide preventive
maintenance for your hard disk.
</P>
<P>
   Once every week, run Scan Disk _ which finds and sometimes fixes
problems that are going wrong on the hard disk. Then run Defrag.
Think of it as a housekeeper for your hard disk. It finds fragments
of programs that become scattered all over the disk and puts them
back together again.
</P>
<P>
   Just running these two programs on a weekly basis can be a big
factor in keeping your computer healthy.
</P>
<P>
   The next step will make sure that it eats right.
</P>
<P>
   If you hooked a good voltage meter up to your household current,
you'd probably be surprised at how variable the voltage is.
</P>
<P>
   It dips and soars like the stock market on steroids. All those
surges and dips can do harm to a PC. They won't toast it like a
lightning strike; instead, they slowly damage the components. Get a
good voltage surge protector (avoid the $14 models that are little
more than fancy extension cords), or better yet, get an
uninterruptible power supply.
</P>
<P>
   This gadget, universally referred to as a UPS, both filters the
current before it gets to your computer and then _ when the power
goes out _ automatically switches to battery power so you can shut
down your computer normally. A UPS was once too pricey for all but
business users, but now you can get one for a little over $100. Do
it _ that's cheap insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Now that I've told you some things that you should do, let's
talk about some stuff not to do.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't turn your PC on and off every time you use it. Leave it
on until you're done with it for the night. Turning the machine on
and off creates current surges that can age components.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't block ventilation holes in the PC or on the monitor.
(Some folks pile papers on top of the monitor. I once saw an
impressive monitor fire right here in the newsroom because of
that.) When it comes to the PC, keep it several inches away from
the sides of a desk or a wall _ or from anything that might block
its intake of air.
</P>
<P>
   _ Periodically open up the case of the PC and look for
accumulations of dust inside. While the case is open, firmly reseat
internal modem cards and any other accessory cards.
</P>
<P>
   The contacts on these cards expand and contract with heat and
cooling and can work themselves loose, creating intermittent
connections.

Net freedom issues shaded in gray 
By Gerry Yandel  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Few things are more fun in the infancy of this mass
communications renaissance than a little piece of free software
with big ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Zimmermann's standoff with the U.S. government a couple
years ago over PGP _ his uncrackable encryption program for e-mail,
which undersells itself as Pretty Good Privacy _ was a thrill to
follow.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow Zimmermann's software got uploaded to the Internet.
Uncle Sam, citing the threat of cyber-terrorism and other
techno-scenarios designed to scare people, wanted the software to
be classified, essentially restricting it from everyday use.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it was already widely distributed across the Net,
and eventually the Justice Department caved in, after threatening
Zimmermann with treason for several years. PGP remains, for the
most part, freely available, and Netizens are allowed to keep their
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Third Voice, which hit the Web at the end of May, is nowhere
near as sophisticated as PGP. But the waters it may stir, and the
basic rights it invokes, run just as deep.
</P>
<P>
   In a simplistic explanation, Third Voice allows any Web surfer
to paste a comment onto any Web page. Any other surfer whose
browser is armed with Third Voice can read the note, render an
addendum expounding on the theme or start a new thread entirely
with a posting of his own. To add a bit of sophistication, notes
can be public, private or personal.
</P>
<P>
   How it works is fairly simple, too. All of the notes _ along
with their positions on the Web page _ are stored on Third Voice
servers. When someone's browser requests a page, the software kicks
in, checking the URL against its database, and displays a copy of
the Web page's HTML code with little icons inserted where the notes
are. Clicking an icon opens the note _ which is stored on the Third
Voice servers _ using the same process. The original Web page code
isn't altered, so the icons are invisible to anyone not using Third
Voice.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the implications of such a program:
</P>
<P>
   People who get ripped off by a company online can warn other
Netizens with a posting right on the offender's home page.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of a particular band or movie could run a Third Voice
thread at the official Web site.
</P>
<P>
   An individual's log-in and password for a Web site can be posted
on a protected note to themselves at the log-in page.
</P>
<P>
   A schoolteacher could leave notes on Web sites she assigns her
class to visit for homework.
</P>
<P>
   Is that cool or what?
</P>
<P>
   Well, some people don't think so _ but that's the stuff that
helps make great philosophical issues fun. Even though Third Voice
is so beta it isn't yet available for Netscape _ coming soon, they
promise _ there's already an opposition party called Say No To
Third Voice, made up of some 400 concerned Web page designers and
developers.
</P>
<P>
   They warn that there are other uses of Third Voice that aren't
so cool:
</P>
<P>
   A vendor could post advertisements on a competitor's site,
offering to undercut prices.
</P>
<P>
   A pornographer could litter hundreds of pages with links to his
Web page.
</P>
<P>
   Obscene rantings could be posted on otherwise pedestrian Web
sites, bloating the Web with even more spam, vulgar spam at that.
</P>
<P>
   But wait a minute. The Net is supposed to be the new global mass
communications medium that gives the power back to the people. It's
the tool that will further the cause of free speech, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Talk about a slippery slope.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of other ways _ good and bad _ the program can
be put to use. The Net's teeming hordes will undoubtedly find
several more _ better and worse _ that aren't even apparent yet.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Third Voice has already spawned an imitator called
Utok. (The Netscape version of Utok is ready now.) Then there's a
program called Gooey that allows users to open chat windows with
each other while browsing the same site. There's one called Odigo
that does both _ chat windows and notes.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most interesting comments I've seen on the issue came
from Jonathan Zittrain, director of the Berkman Center for Internet
&AMP; Society at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arguably, this is the way to draw a mustache on the site,'' he
told Wired magazine, alluding to copyright law that says,
basically, painting a mustache on someone's painting is not
protected under free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand,'' he said, ``if all you're doing is
painting a mustache on a transparency and you look through it, is
that a derivative work?''
</P>
<P>
   There is one point, though, I haven't seen raised about these
kinds of programs that could keep them from ever catching on at the
grass-roots level. In order to work properly, they have to keep
track of your Web surfing movements very closely. That info, as we
all know, is very valuable out on the market.
</P>
<P>
   There are other reasons it might not catch on, too. If the
signal-to-noise ratio gets too high _ i.e. puerile comments and
advertising spam outweigh useful info _ then no one will use it.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, at this point, the issue is in the hands of the
people to be decided.
</P>
<P>
   Once the virtual cat is out of the virtual bag, there's no
turning back.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Phil Zimmermann.

AOL's campus is a quiet happening 
By Frances Katz  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Like Alice in Wonderland, I had a chance to step
behind the America Online sign-on screen and see what life was like
at the company's headquarters in Dulles, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, AOL doesn't call it a headquarters. It's a campus.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear if AOL has extended its rivalry with Microsoft _
which also calls its headquarters a campus _ onto the real estate
front. But the AOL campus is big. There are two very large
buildings and two more being built.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing you notice is how quiet it is. The only noises
are people typing and the infamous ``you've got mail'' and
instant-message chimes ringing out from the endless rows of
cubicles and offices.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every computer screen is cluttered with open mailboxes
and stacks of instant-message screens. One AOL executive said he
seldom answers his phone or checks his voice mail. Amenities for
staffers include a gym, concierge service (where there are people
who will dash out to pick up employees' kids or dry cleaning), a
cafeteria and a gift shop.
</P>
<P>
   The second thing you notice is the decor. It's steel, glass and
Italian modern (and oddly shaped) couches, chairs and computer
chairs. The cool computer workstations are oak with sharp black
accents.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to check your e-mail or surf the Web here, come
armed with an AOL account, because that's the only way you'll get
online. The computers the company makes available for visitors in
the lobby don't even have a stand-alone version of the Netscape
browser, although tour guides are careful to walk visitors past the
office of Netscape creator Marc Andressen _ now an AOL employee.
They deliberately point it out as if to say, ``Yeah, here's the guy
who developed the idea of the Web browser in the first place, but
he works for us now. So there.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL and its employees all seem to radiate a sense of confidence,
self-satisfaction, entitlement and inevitability that is
breathtaking. And why not? They work for the No. 1 online service
in the world, with 17 million subscribers and an estimated 20
million users.
</P>
<P>
   The company's closest competition _ if you can even call it
competition _ is from Internet service providers that average
anywhere from 1 million to 2 million subscribers. Atlanta-based
MindSpring would be in that pack.
</P>
<P>
   Sniffing at numbers like that, Matt Korn, AOL's network
operations senior vice president, estimates that about 2 million
people are online on AOL at any given time.
</P>
<P>
   Walking through the long hallways and winding rows of cubicles
and offices talking with the people who make AOL happen, it is
clear the company didn't reach the 17 million subscriber mark by
wishing and hoping.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the olden days of AOL, the company wowed computer users
by creating an online service that would let people talk to each
other in real time. This single concept, now known as chat, has
become a staple of any successful Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   AOL also pioneered the instant-messaging service. The fact that
Microsoft has developed a similar technology, a cornerstone of
AOL's service for years, has sent AOL into a frenzy for a variety
of reasons both monetary and personal. It's pretty simple to figure
out: AOL thought of it first, lots of people like it, now the
copycats come in.
</P>
<P>
   The senior vice president and general manager of AOL's
interactive services, Jonathan Sacks, says the service is all about
communication on a variety of levels that include not just instant
messaging but chat, e-mail and message boards as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of ways to think about what AOL is,'' he says.
``I think of what can we do to make people's lives easier. We used
to think people just wanted to surf the Web. Now we know they want
to see the benefits of being online. They want to know `How can I
communicate better?' `How can I make my life less complicated?'
`How can I help my kids do better in school?'''
</P>
<P>
   Sacks and most of the decision-makers at AOL know there are
thousands of things to do online.
</P>
<P>
   They also know AOL's killer application is connecting real
people to other real people in real time.
</P>
<P>
   As its members become more sophisticated, AOL has developed new
products to help people stay in touch, even while they're pumping
gas. Another product its getting ready to roll out is the AOL
calendar, which allows groups of friends or business associates to
keep up with changing plans for everything from a soccer match to a
business meeting.
</P>
<P>
   And nobody in Dulles can stop talking about ``You've Got
Pictures,'' a partnership with Kodak and 38,000 retailers across
the country to let members have their family photos sent to AOL to
be put online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers have to have a comfort level,'' Sacks says.
``AOL should be like coming home.''
</P>
<P>
   Bless their hearts, the folks at AOL can't imagine why anyone
would want to live anywhere else.

`Age of Empires' rules over fun 
By Charles Haddad  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You don't see many new war strategy games for the Mac.
That's why the release of Microsoft's Mac version of ``Age of
Empires'' is a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   This game was a huge hit among PC users. I suspect it will have
the same success on the Mac platform, for good reason. ``Age of
Empires'' is a beautifully rendered, live-action strategy game.
Players guide one of a dozen or so ancient civilizations through
12,000 years of development.
</P>
<P>
   The game is reasonably accurate in its depiction of the rise of
civilization. You get to choose from such ancient cultures as the
Chinese Shang, the Babylonians, the Japanese Yamato, the Persians
and the Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
   Each civilization has different strengths and weaknesses. For
example, the Babylonians excel at building impenetrable walled
cities, while the Yamatos are skilled horsemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Age of Empires'' is a cross between ``Warcraft'' and
``Civilization,'' among the two most popular games ever released.
Like ``Warcraft,'' ``Age of Empires'' is a war simulation. You
build and direct armies in real time.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Civilization,'' ``Age of Empires'' requires you to build
and maintain a healthy economy to support your armies. Expansion
and warfare are inextricably tied.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike ``Civilization,'' ``Age of Empires'' is at heart a
war game. No matter how peaceful your intentions, the other
computer-generated players will attack you.
</P>
<P>
   As a war game, ``Age of Empires'' is great fun. Imagine the toy
soldiers of your childhood coming to life before your eyes. That's
what ``Age of Empires'' is like.
</P>
<P>
   The game's animation and sound effects are great. Stones hurled
by catapults soar through the air with trails of smoke. Mortally
wounded cavalry reel, whinny and then collapse on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   While good, ``Age of Empires'' has some serious weaknesses. The
biggest is an inability to see and control all your pieces at once.
</P>
<P>
   There's no global panel that lists all your soldiers, villagers
and buildings. That gets to be a pain when you've got 50 different
pieces scattered across a big map.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that the game is not especially Mac-friendly.
It lacks some of the key commands and shortcuts Mac users take for
granted.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there's no way to just quit the game. You have to
work your way back through a series of screens. Nor is there a way
to turn off three long video clips that introduce the game every
time you start up. What a pain.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, though, ``Age of Empires'' is a wonderful addition to
the Mac pantheon of games. Those who loved ``Warcraft'' and
``Civilization'' will find it irresistible.

Shareware, freeware simple to find 
By Bill Husted  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If butcher shops worked the same way as shareware
software, then you'd be able to take a nice roast home and serve it
to your family. Then _ if everyone thought it made a pretty good
meal _ you'd pay for the roast.
</P>
<P>
   Shareware is software that you can download for free, use and,
if you decide to keep it, send in the money. There's also a
category of software called freeware that you also download for
free, but you never pay a penny.
</P>
<P>
   Almost any type of program, from games to word processors, from
spreadsheets to weird little special purpose programs, is
available. There's shareware for the Mac, PCs, Linux _ almost any
type of operating system or computer you can name is represented.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays most shareware is distributed over the Internet. It's a
perfect distribution system for software of this type, since the
whole idea is to keep the overhead low. Even if you decide to keep
and use a program, the fees are usually small, often in the $20 to
$25 range.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best sites for shareware is at a place called _
appropriately enough _ Shareware.Com (www.shareware.com). Just use
the pull-down menu on the start page to tell it the type of
computer system you are running. Even if you have an Atari or an
Amiga computer, you'll find a selection that's right for your
machine and software.
</P>
<P>
   Then you can use the search feature and a keyword or two to find
your software. Or perhaps you aren't looking for a specific program
but would like to see what's available in a category like games.
You'll find links that take you to shareware libraries organized
according to topic.
</P>
<P>
   Our next site is called Pass the Shareware, located at www
</P>
<P>
   .passtheshareware.com/. This place is really a search engine
that searches various download areas on the Web to help you find
the program you want. The selling point for Pass the Shareware is
that it supposedly searches only for the best available shareware
programs. A claim like that is difficult to evaluate without
thousands of uses.
</P>
<P>
   Another nice feature of this site is a special link that takes
you to sites for freeware. That way, if you want to avoid spending
any money at all, you can restrict your search to freeware.
</P>
<P>
   If _ like many computer users _ you spend most of your computer
time using the Internet, you really need to know about Tucows. When
it comes to freeware and shareware for the Internet, this site at
www.tucows.com/ is simply the best there is.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find Internet programs grouped according to category, and
each has a Tucows rating _ sort of a minireview _ that lets you
know how the gurus at this site view a program. Obviously, you'll
find common programs like Web browsers, FTP programs, newsgroup
readers and e-mail applications here.
</P>
<P>
   But since this site specializes in Internet stuff, it's very
deep. You'll find really esoteric Net software here, too: programs
that let you trace the route to a Web site, programs that time
response time on the Net and other stuff so specialized that you
practically need a degree in computer science to know how to use
it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, CNet's Download.Com is also a great place for general
purpose shareware services. You'll find it at www.download.com.

GOOD NEWS IN COMPUTER GAMES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _These are good times for computer gamers. A
smoking-fast Pentium III computer can be had for less (in some
cases, far less) than $2,000, tricked out with all manner of
multimedia goodies to turn a game into an overwhelmingly immersing
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Even for the less obsessively tweaked gamer, a perfectly decent
machine with a still-muscular Intel Celeron or AMD K6-2 chip can be
had for several hundred dollars. Supplement the chip with any of a
range of good-quality hardware accelerators, and you've got more
than enough machine for a ton of fun.
</P>
<P>
   And on the Macintosh side, Apple has finally acquired a few
major clues, including outfitting all its machines with a 128-bit
ATI Rage accelerator to go with those screaming-fast G3 PowerPC
chips.
</P>
<P>
   Gaming companies are starting to take note, issuing more and
more titles for Macs, either as ports from an earlier PC best
seller, or as hybrid discs that run on either platform. Among the
recent notable additions to that list:
</P>
<P>
   FOR MACS
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Caesar III: &LR;  (Sierra Studios). It's a ridiculously engaging
city-building simulation that is set in the Roman Empire. Think of
it as a kind of SimCity B.C., but better-looking and with a
pantheon of meddling gods and emperors.
</P>
<P>
   To win, you must keep Caesar, your city's residents and five
sometimes petulant gods happy while building up commerce, culture,
education, infrastructure, agriculture, religion and trade.
</P>
<P>
   The graphics are gorgeous and often quite witty, and the
challenges are many, including the possibility of exile or invasion
if you can't keep everyone happy, fed and entertained while
remaining in the black.
</P>
<P>
   Quake II: (Activision) Mac players with an itchy trigger finger
will welcome the conversion of Quake II by Activision. It comes
just ahead of the release of Quake III Arena _ the much-anticipated
online sequel _ and should whet the appetites of hard-core gamers
for that release. As it is, this one allows up to 32 people to play
each other on the Internet or a local-area network.
</P>
<P>
   As with the various PC iterations of Quake, you're a Marine
cleaning out an infestation of deadly invaders with a wide variety
of lethal weaponry. Not politically correct, and please keep it
away from the kids, but definitely one of the best of this
particular genre.
</P>
<P>
   Brood War expansion set for StarCraft: (Blizzard) Another
notable conversion, this one of last year's best-selling PC game,
the real-time strategy StarCraft. The game features three very
different species battling each other for control of the universe,
or at least a little part of it. The expansion set gives you more
of the same good stuff, including 26 new scenarios, more than 100
new multiplayer maps and many new units. &QL; 
FOR PCs
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Total Annihilation: Kingdoms: &LR;  (Cave Dog) This is one of the
most eagerly awaited games to come out this summer, a sequel to the
dark and foreboding real-time strategy game Total Annihilation.
That game, set to wonderfully done music in some distant
science-fiction future, created a rich mood and challenging game
play.
</P>
<P>
   The Kingdoms sequel takes a very different tack, transporting a
player to an ancient world called Darien, where four very different
nations jostle against each other and a threatening new force.
</P>
<P>
   The sequel shifts the game from sci-fi to fantasy, adding magic,
dragons, skeleton fighters and the like. The scale of the fighting
somehow feels different from the original, too, but it still works
great.
</P>
<P>
   And, taking a cue from Blizzard's Battle.net, you can play
online for free at Cave Dog's Boneyards online community. This is a
very good thing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Disney Action Game _ Tarzan: &LR;  (Disney Interactive) In a
completely different realm, Disney recently released a rash of
titles connected with its excellent new ``Tarzan'' animated film.
</P>
<P>
   I have to grouse a bit about the genericized names of the new
titles, which include Disney Print Studio Tarzan, Disney Activity
Center Tarzan and Disney Action Game Tarzan.
</P>
<P>
   Disney Interactive, which routinely puts out good-quality
products, has come to see these things as almost rote efforts,
issued along with the backpacks, burger-franchise kid-meal toys and
other merchandise of every big release.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, it's hard to remember if this is a title for
Tarzan or Hercules or the Lion King, but that attitude can be the
death of good gaming, or any other kind of entertainment, for that
matter.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the action game is excellent (quite similar to the
PlayStation version), with a choice of four characters you can
play, tons of video excerpts from the film, great 3-D graphics and
a range of challenges, including swimming, swinging, riding
elephants and storks, and more.
</P>
<P>
   The activity center title is pitched for a younger crowd, ages 4
to 8. Its best features include a journal-making capability and a
musical ``trash the camp'' function, just as the apes did in the
movie. The activity center also provides lots of printable goodies,
games, stickers and more.
</P>
<P>
   The print studio, like its predecessors for other movies, allows
you to easily create a wide array of Tarzan-themed stationery,
greeting cards, invitations and the like, as well as make online
greeting cards.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Atari Arcade Hits: &LR;  (Hasbro Interactive) For you old-school
gamers, and I mean really old school, Hasbro has revived the old
Atari name and begun issuing an array of classic arcade games on
the PC, PlayStation and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   On Atari Arcade Hits, Hasbro hasn't even revamped the games to
take advantage of new technologies. Instead, you get to play six
much beloved classics: Asteroids, Tempest, Centipede, Missile
Command, Super Breakout and Pong.
</P>
<P>
   There's some other window dressing, such as an interview with
Atari founder Nolan Bushnell, but this is basically the first legal
chance to play these games on a PC.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the code for the games has been available, illegally,
for years on the Internet's Usenet newsgroups, free for the
downloading. All you had to do was find the right emulator software
(also available for the persistent) to make your computer mimic the
old code's old platform, and you were ready to start shooting
centipedes.
</P>
<P>
   But now, for less than $30, you have a more honorable
alternative _ and a better-looking one, too. Atari forever. Amen.
</P>

IN COURT DOCUMENTS, U.S. AND MICROSOFT SUBMIT THEIR VERSIONS OF 
FACTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The witnesses have departed, but the paper wars
began Tuesday in the Microsoft antitrust trial as both sides
presented the court with book-sized documents detailing what each
camp believes are the facts of the case.
</P>
<P>
   The government and Microsoft Corp., not surprisingly, offered
the court two entirely different stories. They did that in person
in the courtroom beginning last October, but Tuesday's filings more
sharply delineate their arguments in painstaking detail, allegation
by allegation, witness by witness, e-mail by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The government alleges that Microsoft engaged in attempted
market collusion, illegally tying one product to another,
exclusionary dealing and predatory pricing. Microsoft replies that
the government may have succeeded in ``portraying Microsoft as an
aggressive company that occasionally engages in tough tactics,''
but that none of it rises to the level of an antitrust violation.
</P>
<P>
   The language of the documents is often even more emphatic than
was the courtroom rhetoric, suggesting a hardening of positions on
both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 19 states suing Microsoft assert that
the big software maker company has a ``powerful and well-entrenched
operating system monopoly'' with Windows, which controls the basic
operations of most personal computers. Microsoft counters that the
evidence in the case and the recent rise of new competitive threats
make it ``painfully obvious that Microsoft does not possess
monopoly power _ the ability to control prices or exclude
competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   The government contends that taken together the mosaic of
Microsoft's misconduct amounts to ``a predatory campaign'' to
stifle competition from Internet software and restrict consumer
choice. ``In other words,'' the government said, ``Microsoft
prevented consumers from getting what they wanted so that Microsoft
could keep what it had _ a monopoly in operating systems.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Microsoft view, the government's consumer-harm claims are
the Achilles heel of the government's case. Microsoft says that its
entire business model is geared to creating ``improved products at
low prices.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite vociferous complaints from a parade of Microsoft's
rivals, who obviously would prefer less vigorous competition,'' the
company declared, ``there was remarkably little evidence about the
impact of Microsoft's actions on consumers, who are, after all, the
intended beneficiaries of the antitrust laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Each such general statement is backed up by citation after
citation from the court record. The government's documents runs 774
pages, and Microsoft's 442 pages. Every Microsoft action and
dealing with another company _ America Online, Intel, Apple, IBM,
Sun Microsystems and others _ is reviewed by each side, point and
counterpoint.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence cited in the pair of legal tomes _ called
``proposed findings of fact'' _ is not new. But this stage of the
trial process permits each side to lay out its interpretation of
the evidence unfettered by the cross-examination and conflicting
evidence submitted in the courtroom.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This is the chance for each side to present its favorite
narrative of events,'' noted William Kovacic, a professor at the
George Washington University law school.
</P>
<P>
   Each side will submit revised findings of fact in September, to
take into account what the other camp asserted Tuesday. For Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson, the fact-finding documents provide a kind
of sourcebook and balancing tool, legal experts say.
</P>
<P>
   For each allegation, the judge weighs the arguments side by
side. In a civil action, the legal standard that must be met by the
plaintiff _ the government, in this case _ is known as
``preponderance of the evidence.'' In simple language, the court
must answer the question, ``Is it more likely than not that the
government's allegation is true?''
</P>
<P>
   Those kinds of ``balancing decisions'' are the ones Jackson must
make repeatedly in this complex case _ and it is why, legal experts
say, the proposed findings of fact can be so crucial to the outcome
of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``These documents are road maps for the judge,'' said Andrew
Gavil, a professor at the Howard University law school. ``If they
work well, they point the judge in a direction that each side wants
him to face in looking at the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft clearly wants Jackson to look at and consider the
multibillion-dollar purchase of Netscape Communications Corp. by
America Online Inc., which was announced last November, after the
trial began.
</P>
<P>
   From the first page of its filing, Microsoft points to the
AOL-Netscape deal, which includes a side alliance with Sun
Microsystems Inc., as proof of what Microsoft argued at the trial:
that the company lives in a fast-changing industry, that its
seemingly powerful market position is constantly under threat and
that the suit itself was the result of its competitors' winning
over the Justice Department to their side.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Netscape's link to America Online, the online service
that accounts for 40 percent of all Internet access in the United
States, Microsoft contends that ``AOL is now in a position of
control with regard to usage of Web browsing software.''
</P>
<P>
   To make the point that Netscape now has a powerful corporate
parent, Microsoft points to previously sealed testimony saying that
the America Online board was told that the company would be willing
to spend $10 a copy to promote Netscape's browser.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft tries to cast doubt on the candor of two government
witnesses _ a Netscape executive, and one from America Online _ by
noting that depositions and documents show that the AOL-Netscape
talks were under way before the trial began.
</P>
<P>
   The government responds that on the contrary, the acquisition of
Netscape proves its point. By using its market power to prod
computer makers and Internet access suppliers into exclusionary
deals, the government asserts, Microsoft succeeded in sufficiently
limiting Netscape's distribution and blunting its challenge to
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netscape was acquired because it had been damaged by
Microsoft's campaign,'' the government stated. And it cited
deposition testimony from AOL chairman Stephen Case, saying that
``we bought Netscape, to some extent, despite the browser
business,'' explaining that the main attractions were Netscape's
popular Web site, server and electronic commerce software.
</P>
<P>
   The government is trying to focus Jackson's attention in
particular on its claims of consumer harm _ even though most
consumers do not see much evidence of it as PC prices continue to
decline.
</P>
<P>
   The government has tried to refine and strengthen its consumer
argument. First, it says that operating system software prices
would be lower if Microsoft were not a monopoly and that consumers
would have more choice. The government cites deposition testimony
from PC makers saying they would prefer to have more choice.
</P>
<P>
   The government then raises the specter of future harm, a
distortion of the path of innovation, unless Microsoft is reined
in. The company is intent on extending ``its monopoly powers into
servers, Internet protocols, and other industry segments.
Microsoft's efforts to pre-empt threats to this control will, in
part, inhibit the emergence of other potential paradigm shifts'' _
a rerun, the government warns, of how Microsoft dispatched the
first wave of the Internet challenge.
</P>
<P>
   That, according to Microsoft, is a totally distorted view of the
company and industry environment it inhabits. ``In short,''
Microsoft said, ``the world is changing very rapidly, and the
changes that are taking place are inconsistent with the notion that
Microsoft possesses durable monopoly power.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometime this fall, Jackson, after poring over the arguments
from both sides, will issue his own findings of fact. These will be
first definitive signal of Jackson's position. His findings will be
the basis for his conclusions of law _ and his findings, legal
experts predict, could also serve as a new prod to reach a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of a settlement, closing arguments are scheduled
to be heard in September, and a ruling is likely around the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have posted their filings on Web sites. The
government document can be found at www.usdoj.gov/atr. The
Microsoft document is at www.microsoft.com/presspass/trial.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    As the gun battles continue to rage in the schools, on the
streets and in the fractious House of Representatives, something is
missing. Amid all the emotional rancor, something has gotten lost
in the controversy.
 &HT;    In a bygone era, they used to call it horse-sense. Today, in the
absence of any sense whatsoever, all that's left is the artful
dodge.
 &HT;    Throughout the debate so far, reason has been trumped by
strident hyperbole. But it need not be this way. It would be
helpful to approach the issue of gun mortality from a more clinical
perspective, taking a cue from the medical community, which deals
with death and morbidity all the time.
 &HT;    Perhaps if we saw the issue for what it really is -- a public
health calamity -- we could bring all the power and insight of
modern medicine to bear on the problem.
 &HT;    The first step in the search for a ``cure'' to the gun malady is
to identify potential causes of the problem. Then, as with any
medical condition, public health authorities could begin to test
their theories. But we can't test any theories -- or even gather
useful information Q- when special interest groups obstruct the
search for solutions.
 &HT;    At a time when additional research is urgently needed, the gun
lobby has called for the elimination of the National Center for
Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), a division of the Centers
for Disease Control. The NCIPC has spearheaded much of the nation's
research on gun mortality, but the National Rifle Association
claims that the center has shown an ``almost vicious sentiment
against personal firearms ownership.''
 &HT;    Though scientists have been known to disagree with CDC findings,
in recent memory, no other organization has ever accused the CDC of
being ``vicious'' in its approach. It's a curious charge, given the
CDC's mission to save lives, but it's entirely consistent with the
NRA's desire to protect the status quo regarding gun ownership in
America.
 &HT;    While the CDC may have focused unwanted attention on gun
violence, it has also stressed a vital message: that further
research is needed to shed light on the causes of firearms
mortality.
 &HT;    In contrast, bitter rivals on both sides of the debate have
insisted that either the media or the gun lobby is to blame for the
epidemic of violence sweeping the nation.
 &HT;    Not surprisingly, gun-control advocates target the firearms
industry while the NRA draws a huge bulls-eye on the foreheads of
media moguls. Apparently, neither side has considered another
option: Why not fire a few shots in both directions?
 &HT;    Of course, hitting something useful is precisely the goal of
scientific research, but it's hard to hit anything useful when your
eyes are closed. It seems safe to assume that the NRA would agree
with this notion. The Motion Picture Association of America, which
is fighting legislation to create a commission on youth violence,
needs its eyes pried open as well.
 &HT;    A good scientist would want to start his inquiry by examining
the existing body of data on gun mortality. Although we still have
much to learn about the causes of gun violence, certain trends are
already emerging from existing research. Substantial data, for
example, indicates that gun-related deaths are a major pediatric
health problem in the U.S. In fact, firearm-related injuries are
the second leading cause of death in children.
 &HT;    Every year, more than 5,000 children die as a result of gun
homicides, suicides and unintentional shootings, and 20,000 more
are wounded. Accidental gun injuries account for almost 1,500
pediatric emergency room visits annually, and in 1994, nearly 200
children were killed in this manner.
 &HT;    Because of such staggering statistics, the American Academy of
Pediatrics has called for aggressive action to reduce the danger of
firearms to young people, including the removal of handguns from
households with children. The AAP has even called for a ban on the
manufacture, sale and private possession of handguns.
 &HT;    The nation's baby doctors aren't alone. In 1998, the Annals of
Internal Medicine reported that 94 percent of internists and 87
percent of surgeons believe that firearm violence is a major public
health issue. The journal also reported that a majority of doctors
surveyed support efforts to enact legislation to restrict the
possession or sale of handguns.
 &HT;    NRA president Charlton Heston probably doesn't agree. But the
NRA leader would be well advised to approach the problem as a
serious public health issue. If he really cares about the nation's
pediatric population, he'll try to think like a healthcare
provider: he'll analyze the available data and make an informed
decision that puts the interest of the patient before all other
concerns (like, for instance, the right to shoot animals).
 &HT;    If Heston could think like a doctor, he'd make the right
decision. Doctors must constantly make choices based on limited
data, since there's so little certainty in the practice of
medicine.
 &HT;    The trick is to make intelligent decisions that reduce
significant risks to the patient. And in the case of handguns, the
most conservative approach (clinically, if not politically) is to
err on the side of caution.
 &HT;    This means more than just putting safety locks on guns, but it
is telling that the NRA has resisted even this minimal treatment
for the gun malady. In 1997, when handgun manufacturers announced a
voluntary program to include trigger locks with new guns to help
reduce firearms injuries, the NRA immediately denounced the
measure. This was not exactly what one would call a ``clinical''
approach to the issue.
 &HT;    The basic problem is that the gun lobby, unlike the medical
establishment, has other priorities: reducing gun fatalities is
ultimately less important than protecting the right of gun owners
to have unfettered access to their weapons. This explains why the
NRA has fought virtually every effort to strengthen the barriers
between weapons and kids.
 &HT;    In its defense, the gun lobby consistently repeats the same
argument like a mantra: improve enforcement of existing laws and
the problem will go away. While better law enforcement is certainly
a worthwhile goal, major public health issues are rarely resolved
by narrowly focused efforts. Systemic, comprehensive solutions are
often required, especially when complex social factors are
involved.
 &HT;    Clearly, any solution that improves the odds for America's youth
-- from child safety locks to restricted access to handguns Q-will
entail some sacrifice on the part of gun owners. But it doesn't
take a brain surgeon to see that it's impossible to reduce the
risks to children without somehow reducing access to guns.
 &HT;    The question is, are gun owners up to the challenge? Are they
willing to do more than simply rely on existing laws? If they're
sincere in their desire to save lives, why not take a more
ambitious approach? Why not use all the tools at our disposal to
protect the nation's children?
 &HT;    That's how a doctor would approach the problem -- he'd do
everything possible to stack the odds in favor of the patient. One
can only hope that the gun lobby will take a similar approach.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    As the gun battles continue to rage in the schools, on the
streets and in the fractious House of Representatives, something is
missing. Amid all the emotional rancor, something has gotten lost
in the controversy.
 &HT;    In a bygone era, they used to call it horse-sense. Today, in the
absence of any sense whatsoever, all that's left is the artful
dodge.
 &HT;    Throughout the debate so far, reason has been trumped by
strident hyperbole. But it need not be this way. It would be
helpful to approach the issue of gun mortality from a more clinical
perspective, taking a cue from the medical community, which deals
with death and morbidity all the time.
 &HT;    Perhaps if we saw the issue for what it really is -- a public

THE CHINESE CRACKDOWN ON FALUN GONG

 &HT;    
 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The biggest threat to the Chinese Communist government is a
group of mostly elderly Chinese citizens who used to gather in
parks in the morning to practice traditional ``aigong'' exercises,
moving their hands around an imaginary wheel to music and Buddhist
meditation called Falun Gong (The Law of the Wheel Breathing
Exercises).
 &HT;    The number of Falun Gong practitioners is somewhere between the
government's estimate of 2 million and the group's own figure of
100 million. The group has no apparent organization or buildings,
charges no fees, and had no political agenda, except to defend its
own right to cultivate Xinxing (mind nature and moral level) in
public.
 &HT;    And there's the rub. Communists fear any kind of independent
group, particularly one with a religious agenda. As a U.S. State
Department expert said, ''They are very conscious of the role
religion played in Eastern Europe.'' Falun Gong denies that it is a
religious group.
 &HT;    However, while people are exercising, they listen to tapes of
the group's founder, Li Hongzhi, 48, who emigrated to America in
January of 1998. What is ''Master Li'' saying?
 &HT;    ''You should always display compassion and kindness toward
others and think of others before doing anything. There will not be
any problems if the first thing that you will think of, whenever
encountering a problem, is whether others can put up with this
matter and if it will hurt anyone. Therefore, you should follow a
higher and higher standard for yourself when you practice
cultivation.''
 &HT;    Falun Gong's philosophy is built on three universally admired
qualities: ''Zhen-Shan-Ren,'' which translate as Truthfulness,
Compassion, Forbearance. The movement has no advertisements and has
spread from heart to heart, which has enabled it to be propagated
quickly. When Li stopped teaching it in person four years ago,
there were only 20,000 followers.
 &HT;    As he puts it: ''The Great Law is being promulgated far and
wide. Those who have heard about it are looking for it. Those who
have attained it are delighted with it. Practitioners are
increasing day by day and they are countless.''
 &HT;    In May, 1998 a physicist criticized Falun Gong for promoting
pseudo science on TV. This infuriated the group and days later
several thousand followers appeared at the TV station demanding
apologies. After a few days, the station caved in, fired the
reporter hosting the show, and praised the good deeds of Falun
Gong.
 &HT;    What good deeds? An October, 1998 study of practitioners in
Beijing Zizhuyuan (a large park in Beijing) revealed remarkable
healing results. Of 700 questionnaires designed by such experts as
the Deputy Chief Physician of the People's University of China
Hospital, 84 percent (584) were returned -- 174 were male and 410
female and two-thirds were aged 51-98. They were intellectuals: 39
percent were college educated; 21 percent had two years of college.
 &HT;    In such an elderly group, 58 percent had cardiovascular problems
before Falun Gong; two-thirds suffered digestive problems; while 6
percent had incurable diseases. Their average annual medical
expense before participating was 3,500 Yuan.
 &HT;    Practitioners said their medical costs had plunged to an average
of 70 Yuan, and 418 said they now had zero medical expenses.
 &HT;    No wonder Falun Gong practitioners are deeply committed. When
governmental leaders called the movement a cult and began arresting
its leaders, an E-mail call sparked 10,000 to 20,000 Falun Gong
followers to gather in silent protest at Tiananmen Square. A
stunned Chinese Prime Minister Zhu Rongji (who visited the U.S.
last spring) met with the group's leaders. (They were later
arrested.)
 &HT;    A front-page story in the ''People's Daily'' newspaper said the
government was not opposed to Falun Gong practice, which is good
for healing; that it was only a rumor that it would extradite
Master Li from America.
 &HT;    ''Months later, they are eating their own words,'' said Master
Li's interpreter.
 &HT;    On July 22, Falun Gong was banned for practicing ''evil
thinking'' and threatening social stability. In 30 cities, police
rounded up tens of thousands of followers, put them in sports
stadiums where they were interrogated over days and forced to sign
letters disavowing the group.
 &HT;    ''In scenes reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution, more than 2
million books and instructional tapes were pulped or crushed by
steam rollers,'' said Time magazine. And 1,200 Communist Party
officials involved in Falun Gong were sent to re-education camps.
 &HT;    The parks are empty today. But the repression is infuriating and
politicizing millions.
 &HT;    Have not Chinese leaders heard that by the blood of martyrs,
Christianity was built? I predict that today's repression is
temporary.

   And you thought reading a nutrition label was confusing.
</P>
<P>
   Grocery labels for ``organic,'' ``certified organic'' and
``natural'' foods can mean different things to different consumers
_ and each would be correct. Legally, the only label that has a
fixed set of rules is ``certified organic,'' and those rules are
shot through with inconsistencies because they're set by individual
states.
</P>
<P>
   _Natural foods and whole foods are minimally processed foods,
but the tag can also hint at health benefits and tout ``no
preservatives'' (although some preservatives are completely
natural, such as salt).
</P>
<P>
   _Organic _ according to columnist, advocate and North Texas
radio celebrity Howard Garrett _ is an understanding of the primacy
of the Earth and the resulting healthful crop, with proper trace
elements. The maintenance of the soil and the plants has been
nontoxic.
</P>
<P>
   Informal guidelines are that fruits and vegetables shouldn't be
treated with pesticides, herbicides or preservatives, and livestock
should be raised in an open-air environment, without antibiotics or
added hormones, on certified organic land. Supplemental feeds and
hay should be certified organic.
</P>
<P>
   _Certified organic is a program governed by states. In Texas,
the state Agriculture Department oversees the practice. Loosely,
growers are not to use synthetic fertilizers or pesticides or
herbicides in their farming and must keep records to that effect.

evolution in schools, the Kansas Board of Education has voted to
delete virtually any mention of evolution from the state's science
curriculum. While the move does not explicitly prevent the teaching
of evolution, proponents and opponents of the decision both believe
it could have a strongly discouraging effect. The board's decision
means that evolution will not be included in the state assessment
tests that all students take, and that is likely to increase
pressure on teachers to spend little or no time on the subject. By
Pam Belluck.

A CORNWELL READING LIST
</HEADLINE>
 (EDS: Accompanies CORNWELL-MYSTERIES) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patricia Cornwell's published work includes 10 Kay Scarpetta
novels, two whodunits featuring Police Chief Judy Hammer, a
``cookbook'' featuring favorite Scarpetta cast members at work in
the kitchen, a biography of Ruth (Mrs. Dr. Billy) Graham and a
children's book. Rabid fans have bought and read them all.
Cornwellian newcomers, though, might be advised to start with the
best of the bunch. These include:
</P>
<P>
   ``Postmortem'' (Harcourt Brace, $20) _ The first Kay Scarpetta
tale, and one of the most distinguished. We learn something of her
past, which includes a broken marriage, and meet people who will,
over the course of the series, become familiar friends, especially
Scarpetta's trouble-prone niece, Lucy. In this initial outing,
Scarpetta et al. try to track down a serial killer who strikes on
Saturday mornings.
</P>
<P>
   ``All That Remains'' (Putnam, $20) _ Many agree this is
Scarpetta's best in-print adventure. Five young couples have been
killed, and, as usual, there seems to be no connection between the
sets of victims except their paired-up circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hornet's Nest'' (Putnam, $25.95) _ In 1997, Cornwell put
Scarpetta aside to introduce Charlotte cop Judy Hammer, a slightly
less rigid Scarpetta clone. Readers dutifully took ``Hornet's
Nest'' to the top of the bestseller list for a couple of weeks, but
they clearly wanted Dr. Kay back. Still, ``Hornet's Nest'' is
well-written and unfairly overlooked, as is ``Southern Cross,'' its
sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life's Little Fable'' (Putnam Children's, $16.99) _ Most
reviews have panned this 1999 attempt by Cornwell to crack the
children's market. Protagonist Jarrod lives in a wonderful place
where he must make tough decisions when offered apparently tempting
choices. There's a lot more going on here than with most other
books written for the 6- to 10-year-old set, and, again, much of
the criticism is probably coming from fans who want Cornwell to
devote herself exclusively to new Scarpetta adventures.

   SKYSCRAPER-GARDENS (New York) _ ``What's astounding to people is
my Silver Queen corn,'' Barbara Schwartz said, pointing to a bumper
crop _ ten teeny ears _ growing 16 stories up on the terrace of her
Park Avenue penthouse. So exotic is the spectacle of espaliered
apples, wild strawberries, blueberries, sweet potatoes, purple
basil, runner beans, garlic and cabbages thriving in containers
amid the Manhattan skyscrapers that visitors invited to admire Ms.
Schwartz's contemporary art reserve their gasps for her
over-the-top rooftop cornucopia. By Christopher Mason.

   BACHELOR-PAD (New York) _ Three and a half years ago, at 29,
Steve Schlackman bought his first apartment, a 1600-square-foot
loft in the center the center of SoHo for (by today's standards)
the fire-sale price of $350,000. Schlackman's eye for a bargain,
however, was sharper than his eye for an interior. ``Like so many
New York bachelors,'' his friend Thom Filicia recalled, ``he had an
L-shaped leather sofa, a big TV with speakers the size of
Volkswagens, and a 45-watt halogen lamp in a corner that was
supposed to light the whole place. He was right out of Playboy
living.'' But, Flicia added dryly, noting Schlackman's fondness for
sailing and cigars and fine wine: ``His bachelor pad didn't groove

HILLARY CLINTON WILL STAND ALONE AMONG FIRST LADIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Aug. 15)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Whether she becomes a U.S. senator or returns to a
law practice, Hillary Rodham Clinton will occupy a unique niche in
the pantheon of American first ladies long after she has left the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone will agree that she deserves a place of honor. But
most will concede that she has been a most unusual and often
controversial president's wife.
</P>
<P>
   As she has demonstrated repeatedly, she is exceedingly adept at
saying and doing things that start tongues wagging and heads
shaking. That is what happened as a result of her interview with
Talk magazine in which she suggested that her husband's sexual
indiscretions may be traceable to a childhood in which he was torn
between two strong women, his mother and his maternal grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's early years were not without difficulty. His father,
Bill Blythe, was killed in an auto accident before he was born. His
mother left him with his grandparents and went off to work in
Louisiana as a nurse-anesthetist. Later she married a man, Roger
Clinton, who was charming but at times an abusive alcoholic. On
occasion the tensions between Bill Clinton's mother and grandmother
resulted in violence.
</P>
<P>
   Whether those years led to his transgressions in later life is
anybody's guess. But the truly miraculous aspect of his life,
according to Hillary Clinton, is that Bill Clinton emerged from
that troubled background to graduate from Georgetown University,
get a Yale law degree, become a Rhodes scholar at Oxford, win
election as governor of Arkansas and become a two-term president of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons are not the most lovable couple to occupy the White
House. But they are highly intelligent public servants who also are
remarkable individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton's activities and her sorrows are not what she or
we envisioned when her husband was inaugurated on Jan. 20, 1993. At
that time, no one could foresee that their marital difficulties and
the president's infidelity would be graphically detailed across
every newspaper, television channel and news magazine in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Nor could anyone foresee that Hillary Clinton one day might
decide to seek elective office in New York.
</P>
<P>
   She has made enemies, been the target of ridicule, and worked
hard to take an active and productive role in her husband's
administration.
</P>
<P>
   More than any first lady before her, she has watched, in shame
and horror, as the most intimate details of her husband's sexual
transgressions have been put before the public and as Congress has
cut the president to shreds while failing to find him guilty of
impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   A disciple of Eleanor Roosevelt, Mrs. Clinton has traveled much
of the world as a spokeswoman and reporter for the president,
involving herself in efforts to improve the education and the lives
of children in the poverty-stricken Third World.
</P>
<P>
   Her revelations about her marriage and her husband's
indiscretions, therefore, are strange for a woman who has been
deeply involved in policy matters for more than six years and who
appears ready to announce she will seek the Senate seat being
vacated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat
</P>
<P>
   Intimate details of one's marriage are not normally expected of
a president's wife or a Senate hopeful. But Hillary Clinton's
experiences have been quite different from those of her
predecessors. She herself was investigated by Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr for her role in the Whitewater real estate venture in
Arkansas while her husband was governor, and she even testified
before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset of the Clinton administration, the president named
the first lady to head a task force to create a plan to extend
health care benefits to uninsured Americans. But the plan she
developed was too massive, too costly and too reminiscent of big
government projects of the past for Congress to enact it.
</P>
<P>
   Rejection of that plan didn't stop her. She went on to write a
book, ``It Takes a Village,'' about her No. 1 public concern, the
care and rearing of children.
</P>
<P>
   For some time, she obviously has pondered the problems that
confronted her husband in his fatherless childhood when he was
reared alternately by his mother and grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   The president's mother, the late Virginia Clinton Kelley, wrote
in in her autobiography that her own mother was an angry woman
obsessed with jealousy who would spend whole nights screaming at
her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``(S)he would just keep shrieking,'' wrote Kelley, ``and
sometimes she would lunge at him and try to hurt him physically.''
At one point, she and her mother indulged in a physical tug-of-war
over little Bill.
</P>
<P>
   After great public attention was focused on her interview with
Talk magazine, Hillary Clinton explained that she did believe that
a troubled childhood provided an excuse for the president's bad
behavior. ``I believe every one of us is responsible for his or her
behavior,'' she said, ``including the president and all the rest of
us.''

THE FIRST RULE OF SOUP: MAKE IT FROM SCRATCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Soup has never been a big item with me. I did eat chicken noodle
as a kid, and yes, I liked to suck the noodles through my teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Now that I am older and much more sophisticated, I no longer do
that _ in mixed company.
</P>
<P>
   Soup, I must admit, was something I ate when there was nothing
else to eat, or when I was sick. I never dreamed of a hot cup of
broth, or a creamy bowl of rich tomato soup.
</P>
<P>
   I have changed. During these summer days when standing in a hot
kitchen seems as inviting as a blistering sunburn, a cup of really
good soup and slices of crusty bread sound enticing. Make it on the
weekend when you have time, then enjoy it during the week when you
don't.
</P>
<P>
   Forget those soups that come in a can, though. They have their
place and can be used for emergencies: stocked up in the storm
cellar and such. They can be used as doorstops, or paperweights,
but not for a satisfying evening meal.
</P>
<P>
   There are cultures in which soup is the defining accomplishment
of local chefs. The chefs might be able to turn out the most
delectable rack of lamb and a marvelous mint jelly, but if the soup
isn't up to standard, they are simply line cooks, not chefs.
</P>
<P>
   A chef understands the subtleties of broths, bouillons and
consommes.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere more than in France is soup revered. Many folks would be
lost without a warm cup of bouillon to start the day. Soup is
automatically among the evening courses.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, soup can be a meal that requires all the ingredients
of the garden and all the skills of the chef. It is never relegated
to snack or side-dish status, though it is often served as a first
course.
</P>
<P>
   In some of the older cookbooks, the kind that value soups made
from scratch, there are a few inviolate rules to be observed.
</P>
<P>
   Never let the soup fall below a slow boil. Once it has begun to
boil, never add water. Of course, master chefs say the soups should
not be brought to a rapid boil, either. They will become muddy and
lose much of their flavor.
</P>
<P>
   If using meat, don't add salt until the end. True believers say
the salt tends to harden the fibers of the meat and prevents the
flow of juices. Others say, hooey, and slap on the salt at the
beginning. Take your pick.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most severe rule is: Never serve a soup that has
simmered for less than five hours. I think it's OK to cheat on this
one.
</P>
<P>
   Bear in mind, these are soups made from scratch, meaning cold
water and a meat bone that has been fractured in several places. It
takes hours for the bone to give up all its flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Here is an Italian soup, taken from a 26-year-old cookbook that
warns, ``You should not hesitate to take some freedom with the
basic recipe, varying its proportions of sausage, beans and cabbage
according to taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Using the author's suggestion, we will eliminate the pork rind
that is generally called for in this rich Tuscan specialty. Use
``pancetta'' if you have it; if not, use bacon. This soup develops
even better flavor when warmed up one or two days later.
</P>
<P>
   From ``The Classic Italian Cook Book,'' by Marcella Hazan
(Knopf, 1973):
</P>
<P>
   RED CABBAGE SOUP
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon chopped garlic
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped yellow onion
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons thinly shredded ``pancetta'' (or bacon)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 pound red cabbage, coarsely shredded
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup chopped celery
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons canned Italian tomatoes, drained and coarsely
chopped
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of thyme
</P>
<P>
   1 cup canned beef broth mixed with 2 cups water (approximate)
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground pepper, 6 to 8 twists of pepper mill
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound Italian sausage
</P>
<P>
   20-ounce can white kidney beans, ``cannellini,'' or other white
beans, drained
</P>
<P>
   Flavored oil:
</P>
<P>
   2 large or 3 medium cloves garlic, lightly crushed with a heavy
knife and peeled
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon chopped rosemary leaves
</P>
<P>
   Put garlic, onion, and ``pancetta'' in a stockpot with the oil
and saute over medium heat until the onion and garlic are very
lightly colored.
</P>
<P>
   Add the shredded cabbage, the chopped celery, the tomatoes and a
tiny pinch of thyme. Cook over medium-low heat until the cabbage
has completely wilted. Stir thoroughly from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   When cabbage has become soft, add the broth, 2 teaspoons salt,
and pepper, cover the pot, and cook at very low heat for 2 to 2 1/2
hours. This cooking may be done at various stages, spread over two
or three days. In fact, the soup acquires even better flavor when
reheated in this manner.
</P>
<P>
   Turn off the heat, uncover the pot, tilt it slightly, and draw
off as much as possible of the fat that rises to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Brown the sausage in a small pan for 6 to 8 minutes over
medium-low heat, drain. Return pot to the burner and bring to a
simmer. Add the browned sausages, drained of their fat. Puree half
the cooked beans and add to the pot. Stir well. Cover and simmer
for 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the remaining whole beans and correct for desired thickness
by adding more broth or water. Taste and correct for salt. Cover
and simmer for 10 minutes more.
</P>
<P>
   Put the crushed garlic cloves and the oil in a small pan and
saute over lively heat until the garlic is nicely browned. Add the
chopped rosemary, turn off the heat and stir two or three times.
Pour the oil through a sieve into the soup pot, cover, and simmer
for 15 minutes more. Serve with good, crusty Italian or French
bread.

PATRICIA CORNWELL IS THE BEST AT WHAT SHE DOES. JUST ASK HER
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by CORNWELL PRIMER and MYSTERIES-JOBS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ As far as Patricia Cornwell is concerned, she doesn't
write mysteries. Instead, she's an author/humanist on a mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty adamant that I'm not a mystery writer,'' Cornwell
said during a brief Dallas stop on a tour promoting her latest
bestseller, ``Black Notice.'' ``It's not right that, in the most
violent country in the Free World, we trivialize books about death
by calling them `mysteries.' It's a mission to me _ I am a crime
fighter using a pen.''
</P>
<P>
   Crime fighter or writer, Cornwell is dominating what the
publishing industry will continue to term ``the mystery market.''
Since ``Postmortem,'' her first novel featuring Richmond, Va.,
chief medical examiner Kay Scarpetta, was published in 1990,
Cornwell has penned a series of No. 1 bestsellers that often star
Scarpetta. They also include minutely detailed descriptions of
autopsies and vivid accounts of the devastating emotional impact on
family and friends of murder victims.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the 43-year-old Cornwell has become a celebrity
in her own right, with her professional background _ she worked for
the Richmond Medical Examiner's office before writing and selling
her first Scarpetta novel _ as familiar to readers as Scarpetta's
fictional career.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Cornwell and Scarpetta can't be separated. Cornwell's
explanation of how she, practically alone among current so-called
mystery writers, is qualified to describe murders, eerily echoes a
descriptive passage from any Scarpetta novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't see what I've seen in morgues and call my books
mysteries,'' Cornwell insists. ``I worked in a morgue, I scribed
during the autopsies, took notes, and sometimes if it was a hectic
day I'd be there in gown and gloves and have my hands inside a
body. I remember the first time I did, how cold the blood was
because the body had been refrigerated. That's as real as death
gets. I wish more writers kept me company, understood what I
understand. They owe it to society to take death seriously. I would
never trivialize death and violence. Other authors just don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   In person, Cornwell is surprisingly small, but with hints of
tensile-steel-wire toughness. Her eyes, blue and burning, are the
writer's most memorable feature. In an emergency, she would expect
to be in charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black Notice'' is already a bestseller in its first week after
publication, so Cornwell feels little obligation to tout the book.
Instead, she wants to reiterate her dedication, even obsession,
with proper research for every book she has written.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they read my books, readers are learning, whether they
want to or not,'' Cornwell says. ``I'm not a rocket scientist, but
I'll go to the trouble of finding out every detail so my books have
it all right. I will go to wherever I need to, and look and smell
and feel.''
</P>
<P>
   That dedication recently brought Cornwell to Fort Worth, a city
she says she enjoys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bell Helicopter's training facility is in Fort Worth, so I
went there in June and July,'' says Cornwell, whose previous
research efforts included learning to scuba dive. ``Bell's big new
(helicopter) is the 407, one I now own, by the way, and I came down
and took classes, and one of their instructors also came to
Richmond, where I live, for two weeks. The reason I chose them over
any other helicopter manufacturer was, Bell teaches you how to stay
alive. Helicopters themselves are not dangerous, but sometimes the
people who fly them are.''
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that Cornwell now flies her own helicopter (one a
Bell spokesman says sells for ``the generic price of $1.2
million''), and Fort Worth is likely to be included in a future
Scarpetta novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten rather attached to Fort Worth, and it's crossed my
mind I might use it as a setting,'' she says, grinning. ``Scarpetta
may have to come there if Lucy (her fictional niece) was involved
at Bell in some way.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornwell also knows she must deal with heightened fan
expectations for each new Scarpetta book.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ambition is that each book must be better than the last
one; that's non-negotiable. I'm so popular now that if I ever fall,
I'll fall really hard. I know that. But I'll never give people
tired books _ I just don't see that happening.''

<P>
   PRAGUE _ Forget American in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Think American in Prague.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as in the case of Paula Salguero, a naturalized American in
Prague.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salguero, 25, was born in Costa Rica and grew up in the
U.S., where her parents make their home. It was after becoming an
American citizen and finishing college that she came to Prague as
part of her own ongoing education program ``to learn what I can of
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a year ago. After having to go ``to hell and back
through the bureaucracy for a work permit,'' she has a job in a
language school teaching English and Spanish. Eventually she plans
to return to the U.S., but for now, ``Prague's not a bad place to
be,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, prices are cheap. You can live reasonably well
for as little as $1,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Too, Prague is the kind of city where you feel safe.
Purse-snatching is about the extent of street crime. ``So far, it
hasn't been a problem for me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her only real scare came late one night not long after she first
arrived, when she had taken the wrong tram car and ended up lost in
a mostly deserted part of the city.
</P>
<P>
   A man passing by and sensing her distress stopped to ask if he
could help find her a taxi.
</P>
<P>
   First he asked in Czech. She shook her head. No, she couldn't
speak Czech.
</P>
<P>
   Then he tried German. She shook her head again. French? No luck
with that, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``English?'' she said. The man shook his head. ``Espanol?'' she
said, her last chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Si, si!'' he exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   Both could hardly believe it. ``We were probably the only two
people out that night, in all of Prague, who could speak Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
   Though language is her field, she hasn't yet mastered much of
the Czech tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very complicated,'' she said. ``A pronoun can take nine
different forms depending on the circumstance.''
</P>
<P>
   For an American living in Prague, ``people appreciate your
making the effort,'' she said. ``A little of the language goes a
long way.''
</P>
<P>
   (Note: ``Hello'' is ``dobry den'' formally and ``ahoj''
informally, something akin to ahoy.)
</P>
<P>
   Czechs, at the same time, are eager to learn English.
</P>
<P>
   The people, Ms. Salguero said, put a great importance on
education. ``That's the first thing they want to know about you.
Not what you do, but what degrees you have and where you studied.
</P>
<P>
   ``They consider English the language of the future. They'll tell
you, 'We need to know your language in order to succeed.' ``
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a number of her students are businessmen. But
understanding English is not all they need to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost nobody understands how you're supposed to run a
business,'' she said. ``Managers have to be brought in from the
U.S. and England to teach the basics.''
</P>
<P>
   One company, she said, resorted to elementary school tactics,
publicly pasting stars or frowny faces besides the names of
employees for good or bad work. Four frowny faces and you were
fired.
</P>
<P>
   Production improved over a period of time, but not until some 60
percent of the work force had been let go.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here don't like to work,'' she said. ``They're still
thinking in terms of communism, that they can sit around and drink
beer and still get paid.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Ms. Salguero got nowhere trying to have her class
translate, ``I complained because a store clerk gave me poor
service.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They couldn't understand,'' she said. ``They asked, 'Why would
you do that?' ``
</P>
<P>
   Finally, class members came up with a usage that made sense to
them:
</P>
<P>
   ``I complained because my boss gave me too much work.''

<P>
   During the last decade there has been a quiet revolution in
power tools. Designers and manufacturers have introduced a number
of changes that affect their look and performance. Most of these
changes were made in response to the demands of the building trade,
but they are not limited to industrial tools. The innovations are
present in the tools available to do-it-yourselfers and homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   The most sweeping modification is the development of cordless _
that is, battery-operated _ power tools. Only a decade ago,
battery-powered tools could be operated only for relatively small
jobs because the battery pack would not hold a charge. With today's
technology, battery packs are able to hold a charge longer and
supply enough power to meet the demands of tough jobs. Today,
battery-powered tools account for more than 75 percent of all power
tools sold.
</P>
<P>
   The electrolyte in most battery packs is nickel cadmium
(abbreviated Ni-Cd). For years, however, nickel-cadmium batteries
presented a ''memory'' problem. If, for example, the tool was used
for a job that required a continuous series of short power bursts _
like driving screws into wall board _ the battery became attuned to
the number of bursts generated and it could be charged only for
that amount.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to erase the memory was by running the tool
continuously to discharge the battery, then recharge it. This
problem was caused by impurities in the nickel-cadmium electrolyte.
Using advanced refining methods, manufacturers are now able to
remove these impurities in the nickel cadmium and eliminate the
memory problem.
</P>
<P>
   Nickel-cadmium batteries present another problem, because the
cadmium in the electrolyte can be harmful to the environment. For
this reason, many European tool manufacturers are switching to
nickel metal hydride (abbreviated Ni-MH) as an electrolyte in
rechargeable batteries. Nickel metal hydride is easier to dispose
of, but it does not always make an efficient battery.
</P>
<P>
   It is ideal for devices with low current requirements, like cell
phones, but batteries with nickel metal hydride cannot always
deliver the high currents needed for power tools. Nickel metal
hydride is also temperature-sensitive and the batteries lose power
at low temperatures. For this reason, manufacturers of nickel metal
hydride batteries often recommend that the user keep a spare
battery pack in his pants pocket as he works outdoors on a cold
day. The rationale is that body heat will keep the unit warm enough
to retain most of its power.
</P>
<P>
   For these reasons, American manufacturers are committed to using
nickel cadmium as an electrolyte in rechargeable batteries, at
least for the foreseeable future. To address the pollution problem,
they have set up recycling centers throughout the country so users
can dispose of the spent battery packs safely.
</P>
<P>
   Recharging a power pack produces a significant amount of heat in
the cells, which is detrimental to the electrolyte and will
eventually shorten the life of the battery. Some manufacturers have
introduced a soft-pulse battery charger that minimizes heat
build-up by charging the batteries with numerous short bursts of
electricity rather than a continuous charge. In addition, this
process produces a more efficient charge and extends battery life
beyond 1,000 charges.
</P>
<P>
   Another significant modification in battery packs is the concept
of interchangeable modules. For many years, battery power packs
were designed for specific tools and could be used only on that
tool. Recently some manufactures have created modular power packs
that can be switched from a drill to a circular saw or to a work
light.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of any power tool is the motor. It must be large
enough to deliver enough force for the task at hand, yet small
enough to be contained in a hand- held tool. Tools with powerful
motors were often bulky and heavy, but manufacturers have replaced
standard motor magnets with high-flux, rare-earth magnets. These
magnets are about half the size of traditional ones, yet they still
generate a powerful magnetic field around the armature. With these
new magnets, motors are smaller, yet they achieve higher torque
ratings, operate more efficiently and have longer run times.
</P>
<P>
   A recent and convenient improvement in electric drills is the
introduction of the keyless chuck. The drill bit can be clamped in
the chuck by twisting the chuck collar with your hand.

   &UR; The Lotus That Forgot &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The Momo Botan lotus in my backyard pond bloomed well (three
or four flowers) the first summer after I brought it home from the
nursery. But for several summers, it has produced only one or two
blossoms. The tubers were divided and repotted last year, but even
in the hot, sunny summer of 1999, there's been only one bloom.
</P>
<P>
   The pot, which has multiple tubers, gets lots of sun; the
growing tips are within an inch or two of the water surface, and
every couple of weeks I push four tablets of aquatic plant
fertilizer into the container, as recommended. Should I just give
up, dig out the tubers, saute the blessed things and, like the
lotus-eaters of old, serenely recall the beauty of those first
blooms?
</P>
<P>
   A. Often plants rebel if they are too crowded, so make sure the
pot is large enough _ 12 to 15 inches in diameter is best. Maybe
it's as simple as that, because everything else you're doing is
just fine. This year, the plants are probably taking a breather
after being divided and will bloom more profusely next year.
Dividing every three or four years is important, and you'll
probably have plenty of tubers to give away.
</P>
<P>
   It's likely that the lotus eaters in Homer's ``Odyssey'' were
indulging in either the opium poppy or wine made from the fruit of
its buckthorn relative, Ziziphus lotus (reputed to cause
forgetfulness and contentment), not your sacred lotus, Nelumbo
nucifera. I don't know what the effect of frying the tubers would
be, but it sure would end any chance of seeing any more of those
fragrant six-inch-wide rosy-pink flowers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Color Tells All &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I need an answer to the issue of hydrangea color. With
indicator dyes, pink is common for acid conditions and blue for
basic conditions. But a gardening friend says that for hydrangea
flowers to be blue, you need acid soil _ which seems backward. My
soil usually needs to be acidified to keep my azaleas happy, yet
the new lace leaf hydrangea I put in was the most wonderful,
heavenly blue. Please set me straight. Are there other plants whose
colors change with acidity?
</P>
<P>
   A. Many indicator dyes do turn red in acid and blue in alkali,
but the hydrangea flower's color response is unique. Research shows
that the flower color is not directly affected by acid or alkaline
conditions; rather, the key factor is the availability of aluminum.
Acidic conditions convert the aluminum compounds normally present
in the soil into a form that the shrub can absorb, resulting in a
blue flower; in alkaline soil, the aluminum remains tied up in
insoluble compounds. No other garden plant is so insistent on
telling it like it is.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Mum's a Mum, or Isn't It? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If you've been very good about your botanical names, sticking to
them even in the face of common sense and the blank stares of your
friends, vindication is at hand.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, a Russian botanist, Nikolai Tzvelev, removed all but
two members of the genus Chrysanthemum and scattered them among a
dozen genera. Gardeners didn't care until recently, when books and
catalogs began using Dendranthema instead of Chrysanthemum for most
common mums. This month, Tzvelev's classification was partly
reversed by the international committee responsible for plant
taxonomy and nomenclature.
</P>
<P>
   The change, moving the garden chrysanthemums out of Dendranthema
and back into the genus Chrysanthemum, isn't a reversal of a Cold
War assault on Western imperialist gardeners but evidence of a thaw
in the war between botanists and horticulturists. Tzvelev was right
botanically, but he was on the wrong side of common usage and the
pressures of the international marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Each genus has a key member, and every species in that genus
must share a number of its characteristics. In a neat sleight of
hand, botanists changed Chrysanthemum's key member and moved the
garden mums back where gardeners always thought they should be.
</P>
<P>
   But only the garden mums are affected. All the other former
chrysanthemums, which are scattered among the genera Ajania,
Nipponanthemum, Argyranthemum, Leucanthemopsis, Leucanthemum,
Tanacetum and more, will remain where they are for the foreseeable
future. At least mums are back to being mums.
</P>

SCIENTISTS USE WEB TO SHARE A COSTLY TOOL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla., Md.)   (af)  
 By KAREN FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the price of a scientific instrument runs into hundreds of
thousands of dollars, it makes sense for scientists to try to get a
lot of mileage out of it, linking up for experiments and peering
over one another's shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Florida in Gainesville has found a way to
stretch those links across the state or around the world by making
the controls for a costly instrument as easy to use as navigating a
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the controls are on the Web, accessible to any
laboratory or classroom with Internet access. The instrument is a
nuclear magnetic resonance, or NMR, spectrometer at the
microbiology and cell science department on the Gainesville campus.
</P>
<P>
   An NMR spectrometer analyzes the behavior of atoms in a strong
magnetic field, which tells much about the underlying chemical or
physical processes in the tissue being studied.
</P>
<P>
   It works like its medical cousin, the MRI, or magnetic resonance
imaging, spectrometer. ``It's the same instrument, but in medicine
nobody likes to use the word `nuclear,'' said Dr. Edward Hoffmann,
the department chairman. ``So they don't use the n-word, but it's
essentially the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   By making a $300,000 NMR spectrometer available through the Web,
the University of Florida is solving two problems of access. First,
it puts the instrument within the reach of institutions that cannot
afford one of their own. Use of the instrument is free.
</P>
<P>
   ``NMR instruments are very expensive,'' Hoffmann said. ``Not
everyone can afford one, but the instruments can perform a lot of
very interesting noninvasive procedures on cells.'' Despite the
high cost, most major universities have one or more.
</P>
<P>
   Second, it makes it possible for scientists and students to
control the instrument without spending a lot of time in training.
NMR instruments are complex, and it generally takes a while to
learn enough to run even the simplest experiment. The Web-based
controls are much easier to master.
</P>
<P>
   In the University of Florida program, run by Dr. Marian L.
Buszko, users log on to the NMR spectrometer site
(m110.ifas.ufl.edu) and see the familiar graphical interface of a
Web browser, which lets them control the instrument.
</P>
<P>
   Once an experiment has been scheduled, a laboratory technician
prepares a sample of cells or living microorganisms and puts them
into a chamber in the instrument, and the experiment is run from a
laboratory or classroom elsewhere, on campus or off. People who
visit the site can watch work in progress. They can also find NMR
information at the NMR Information Server (www.nmr.ufl.edu), which
the university said is getting about 25,000 hits a week.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the spectrometer has been used by agricultural
researchers in Homestead, Fla., 350 miles away; at the University
of Maryland, and by various researchers and classes on campus. The
Web project began in 1996 and has been supported by the United
States Department of Agriculture, Sun Microsystems, Real-Time
Innovations, the Altera Corp. and the University of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In a current project, researchers at the University of Florida
are studying the effect of zinc on prostate tumor cells.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffmann said he expected large numbers of scientists and
students to use the NMR service and would like to see similar
projects done in other areas of science.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could use the computer to remotely access all kinds of
instruments,'' he explained, ``particularly very expensive ones, if
they are amenable to this kind of operation, in which you stick a
sample in and take readings over time.''

THIRD-PARTY CANDIDATES FOR PRESIDENT DON'T SERVE UP POLITICS AS
USUAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAX B. BAKER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're tired of politics as usual and think Vice President Al
Gore is stiff, Texas Gov. George W. Bush is evasive and pundit Pat
Buchanan is too shrill, there is an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there are at least 50 of them _ minor party candidates
running or being promoted for the 2000 presidential race. They
include a professional wrestler known as ``Nature Boy'' and an Iowa
physicist who levitates and meditates.
</P>
<P>
   Although history indicates that independent candidates can't
win, Ross Perot's 1992 presidential bid and Minnesota Gov. Jesse
Ventura's victory are proof that Americans are willing to support
candidates who are outside of the norm, observers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Americans realize we cannot survive the next millennium
without a radical rethinking of our policies, institutions and
patterns of behavior,'' said John Hagelin, the Natural Law Party's
levitating presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin vows to run the ``largest, most successful third-party
campaign in U.S. history.''
</P>
<P>
   A former Marine corporal and gay Libertarian candidate, Larry
Hines, started his campaign on the Internet. The the 35-year-old
legal secretary said that all he wants to do is debate the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not delusional enough to think I'm going to win. I don't
think winning is a reason to do it,'' Hines said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there needs to be competition out there and different
points of view and discussion. Today's politicians are so vague,
you don't know what they believe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The only third-party candidate to come close to winning was
Theodore Roosevelt in 1912, running under the banner of the
Progressive Party. Coming in second to Woodrow Wilson in a
three-man field, Roosevelt was still popular from his presidency as
a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Although former U.S. Rep. John Anderson, Pat Paulsen and
consumer advocate Ralph Nader put a spotlight on outsiders seeking
the Oval Office, voters apparently didn't take independent
challengers very seriously until Perot ran.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the Dallas entrepreneur debated President Bush and
challenger Bill Clinton and got 19 percent of the vote. This year,
supporters of former Connecticut Gov. Lowell Weicker Jr. and
Buchanan are seeking the support of Perot's Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire, who considered running as
a Reform Party candidate, announced this week that he will run for
president as a candidate of the U.S. Taxpayers Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows you have bored everybody with the two candidates the
Republicans and Democrats want to present,'' said Russ Verney,
former Reform Party chairman and Perot confidant.
</P>
<P>
   Many independent candidates wage their campaigns primarily in
cyberspace and in post office boxes. Some promote themselves.
Others are being recruited.
</P>
<P>
   A superstar on the professional wrestling circuit, Richard
Morgan Fliehr is known as Ric Flair, a.k.a. ``The Nature Boy,''
``The Man,'' and ``Slick Ric.'' The 48-year-old Minnesotan sports
long blond hair and a flashy feathered robe.
</P>
<P>
   A ``Ric Flair for President'' Web site made by fans includes a
petition and says: ``Together we need to convince Ric Flair to run
for our highest office. Then, American can be great once again.''
</P>
<P>
   Flair couldn't be reached to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Bellis III, however, doesn't need a fan club. According to
his Web site, the software project manager in Overland Park, Kan.,
says he was a friend of former President Truman, drives around in a
``rust-covered 1979 Chrysler LeBaron'' and wears clothes bought at
garage sales.
</P>
<P>
   Bellis, 44, writes that his major campaign issue is to end
needless government spending, or ``pork,'' by declaring all such
activity unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the kind of person you would normally see seeking the
office ...'' Bellis says. ``But being abnormal is good in this
case.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Southern Party doesn't have a candidate, it is
seeking one who will support its campaign to allow the 11 states of
the old Confederacy and five other states _ Oklahoma, Missouri,
Kentucky, West Virginia and Maryland _ to secede from the union.
</P>
<P>
   The fringe candidates and their causes don't make things any
easier for third-party candidates such as Hagelin, the Natural Law
Party candidate, who plans to spend up to $10 million running in
2000. Hagelin's name will appear on the ballot in all 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   He is running on a platform emphasizing alternative solutions to
the nation's ills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that people are quite frustrated by the choices. We
can't continue to do for the next thousand years what we've been
doing. Al Gore, George Bush, Elizabeth Dole. The names haven't
changed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To his chagrin, however, most voters remember that the Natural
Law Party was created by followers of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi at his
Maharishi International University in Fairfield, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Followers of the maharishi, who introduced transcendental
meditation to the West, believe that meditation is the answer to
the world's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Hines, a Texan raised in Merkel, said he's not running because
he's gay and HIV-positive. An ultraconservative who says he is not
accepted by the gay community, Hines wants to privatize education
and withdraw from the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do everything the big boys do. I just don't have the money.
I've been in parades and gone to conventions. Only, I'm saying
something,'' Hines said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the conditions may not be right for an independent to
defeat _ or even seriously challenge _ the Democrats and
Republicans, it doesn't mean the third-party movement is over.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of
Virginia in Charlottesville, said voters were angry enough in 1992
to support an independent. Had Perot been a better candidate, he
would have won, Sabato said.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing to keep such a phenomenon from happing again,
Sabato said.
</P>

   &UR; Identifying Windows 98 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can I tell which version of Windows 98 I am running? I
have heard there are problems upgrading a Toshiba computer to the
Windows 98 Second Edition. Is this true, and what do I need to do
to upgrade?
</P>
<P>
   A. If you can't tell from your documentation what version of
Windows 98 you are using, right-click on the My Computer icon.
Click on Properties to see the version of the operating system that
is running.
</P>
<P>
   If you are installing Windows 98 Second Edition on a Toshiba PC,
you might get an error message about Windows finding incompatible
device drivers on your system. (Microsoft has acknowledged this
problem with Toshiba PC's and has posted instructions for resolving
it in the Support area of its Web site.)
</P>
<P>
   If you get the error while trying to upgrade and it halts your
progress, quit the Setup program. Go to your Windows/System folder
and delete the file named Spower.drv from your computer before
running Setup again. You will then want to visit the support area
of Toshiba's Web site (pcsupport.toshiba.com) so you can download
and install an updated set of drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 Second Edition includes new features like support for
USB modems, Internet Explorer 5.0, DirectX 6.1 and Microsoft Net
Meeting 3.0. Microsoft Network 5.0 is also included. To run this
new version of the operating system, you must have at least a 486
processor, 24 megabytes of RAM, 260 megabytes of available hard
drive space and a CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   Circuits invites questions about computer-based technology, by

<P>
   CHICAGO _ Impassioned visitors once flocked to the University of
Chicago's Alumni Association office at 5757 South Woodlawn Ave.
Some pleaded to be allowed inside the small brick building. Others
just gaped through the windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were eating lunch at your desk, and especially if you
had brought along a banana, you felt a bit like a great ape at the
zoo,'' said Mary Ruth Yoe, the editor of The University of Chicago
Magazine. ``It was all you could do to keep from throwing the peel
to the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, tourists had not come to watch Ms. Yoe and her
colleagues. They had come to see Frank Lloyd Wright's Robie House.
</P>
<P>
   For 71 years, this masterpiece of American domestic architecture
_ as horizontal and flowing as the prairie, as refined and
intricate as a Japanese screen, as complex and enigmatic as a
Cubist painting _ was used and sometimes abused by a succession of
institutional tenants.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, an asbestos-abatement project will begin, paving the
way for a 10-year, $7 million restoration of the building as a
house museum.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to turn the clock back to 1910, when the house was
newly completed with an extraordinary suite of furniture designed
by Wright and George M. Niedecken of Milwaukee. Reproductions of
the furniture currently greet visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The furniture is so integral to the design,'' said Karen A.
Sweeney, an architect and director of restoration for the Frank
Lloyd Wright Home and Studio Foundation, which manages the house
and will oversee the restoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we'll get the originals back,'' she said. ``But
until we get to the roof restoration and climate control, we
wouldn't want to compromise the furniture.''
</P>
<P>
   A built-in dining-room cabinet, inglenook enclosure, breakfast
nook table and armless rocking chair have disappeared. Remarkably,
however, much of the furniture is not only intact, but also still
together under one roof, though not under the deep eaves of the
Robie House roof.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two pieces, including the famous ramrod-straight
dining-room chairs, are in the David and Alfred Smart Museum of Art
at the university. They were donated by the Chicago Theological
Seminary, which once owned the Robie House.
</P>
<P>
   The living room sofa, with broad oak armrests, cantilevered like
wings from either side, also belongs to the Smart Museum but has
been on loan since 1982 to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which
displays it in the American Wing.
</P>
<P>
   Kimerly Rorschach, the director of the Smart Museum, said she
was confident that an agreement could be reached allowing ``quite a
lot of furniture'' to be transferred to the Robie House, once the
museum was assured of security and environmental controls. ``We
have every interest in having that house interpreted as
historically accurately and interestingly as possible,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Hoover Voorsanger, associate curator of American
decorative arts at the Met, said the museum would relinquish the
sofa if asked to do so, though its removal would create a ``major
gap'' in its extensive Wright collection.
</P>
<P>
   But long before the moving van arrives on Fifth Avenue, the
Wright foundation must raise millions of dollars. The scope and
timing of the restoration project will depend in part on the
success of that capital campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The roof needs an ice and water shield in the form of a rubber
layer under the clay tiles. Exterior walls of extra-long,
iron-spotted Roman brick must be repointed and in some cases
rebuilt. New climate-control and fire-extinguishing systems are
required. The 174 windows with patterned art glass need new lead
cames.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning next Wednesday, a flooring material on the first level
_ a compound of magnesium chloride, sawdust and asbestos _ will be
replaced with a similarly absorptive, lightweight compound, minus
the asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   For about two weeks, the foundation will suspend the daily
guided tours it ordinarily offers.
</P>
<P>
   The house was built in 1909 for Frederick C. Robie, a bicycle
manufacturer, who worked closely with Wright in developing the
free-flowing design. The Robies moved out in 1911.
</P>
<P>
   The seminary converted it into a dormitory in 1926 but later
sought to raze it. The New York developer William Zeckendorf
stepped in to save the house in 1958. Five years later, he gave it
to the university, whose campus is across the street.
</P>
<P>
   It served as the Adlai E. Stevenson Institute of International
Affairs, then as the development office, alumni office and magazine
office. In 1997, the university leased the house to the National
Trust for Historic Preservation. The trust subleases it to the
foundation, which has restored Wright's home and studio in Oak
Park, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the foundation is hoping that a scrap of the original
textiles _ runners, tablecloths, portieres and bedspreads, some
embroidered with diamond patterns similar to the art-glass windows
_ still exists somewhere. ``If someone has even a fragment,'' Ms.
Sweeney said, ``we'd love to see that.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jordan Ray, age 10, faced a shopping dilemma. Too young to go to
the toy store by himself, Jordon, of Brooklyn, N.Y., had to pester
his dad to drive him there whenever he wanted to check out a new
video game.
</P>
<P>
   That proved to be just as painful for his father, Robert Ray.
``When we went to the store, I would stand there, feeling like I
was just a pay object,'' Ray said. ``He'd pick out something, then
I'd pay. He did not understand the concept of sales tax, or of
cost. He only understood the concept of `I'm getting something.'''
</P>
<P>
   All that changed in June, after Jordan finished the fifth grade.
As a graduation gift, his grandmother set up a new kind of account
to make it possible for Jordan to shop alone _ on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   With a $50 credit in an online account, Jordan eagerly logged
on. But as he tried to decide which video games to buy, he realized
he had a new problem: shipping costs put him over budget. It took
him a few weeks to figure out a solution: when he finally made his
first purchase in July, he opted for less expensive items _
videotapes _ because then he could afford to pay the shipping
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' Robert Ray said about his son's account. ``Now he
understands cost.'' (Of course, this being the Internet, Jordan
still doesn't understand sales tax.)
</P>
<P>
   As Jordan agonized between choosing ``Lady and the Tramp'' or
``The Parent Trap,'' he became a member of the newest group to be
pursued by E-commerce entrepreneurs: children. Jupiter
Communications, the Internet research firm, predicts that children
ages 5 to 18 will spend $1.3 billion on line by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by such projections, a number of companies are
rushing to introduce Web sites designed to encourage children like
Jordan to buy from online retailers who sell items like clothing,
toys and books, including J. Crew, Toys ``R'' Us, Kaybee Toy and
Hobby Stores and Barnes &AMP; Noble.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a natural evolution, because today's kids are
sophisticated and already are comfortable using the Internet for
other things,'' said Anya Sacharow, an analyst at Jupiter
Communications. ``The main thing that was stopping them from buying
on line was that they didn't have their own credit cards.''
</P>
<P>
   At three new online shopping sites, they don't need their own
credit cards _ they rely on their parents'. At Icanbuy
(www.icanbuy.com), Rocket Cash (www.rocketcash.com) and Doughnet
(www.doughnet.com), parents set up the children's accounts and
either deposit a minimum amount (from $1 to $25, depending on the
site) by charging it to a credit card or establish a credit line
with a spending limit.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, children do not have to have direct access to their
parents' credit card information to make purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'll ever replace the mall as a place where
kids go to hang out with their friends, and I don't think we'll
have tons of teen-agers sitting alone at home, shopping by
themselves on line,'' said Carol Kruse, co-founder and vice
president of marketing at Rocket Cash. ``But we can offer really
neat items and better convenience and sometimes better prices.''
</P>
<P>
   But some psychologists and financial planners question whether
it's a good idea to make it easier for today's children to spend
money. ``Parents feel guilty about their children, and they try to
make it up to them by buying things,'' said Carol Seefeldt, a
professor at the University of Maryland's Institute for Child
Studies. ``I see a lot of parents who do not want their children to
ever delay gratification, but that's the wrong approach.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Professor Seefeldt said, children who learn that they
have to earn their rewards are more likely to achieve success both
in academics and later in life. ``Saving and investing gives kids
an important sense of self-control over their lives,'' she said.
``We want to teach them to take care of themselves rather than to
expect people to take care of them.''
</P>
<P>
   A generation or two ago, teaching a child to manage money wisely
meant learning to save or invest, not spend. In those days,
high-school students learned to budget and to balance a checkbook
in required home economics classes. But today, those courses are
often bypassed electives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents are the ones who are teaching children how to spend,
but very few are sitting down and teaching them formally how to
balance a checkbook,'' said Dara Duguay, executive director of the
Jumpstart Coalition, a nonprofit group in Washington that is
working with Icanbuy to expand an education section on its site.
</P>
<P>
   The proprieters of the online shopping sites aimed at children
say they don't encourage kids to be spendthrifts. ``The ability to
shop is already there, in stores and malls and through catalogs,''
said Jeffrey Mason, president and chief executive of Rocket Cash.
``All we want to do is offer the same convenience to kids who are
shopping at a mall to shop online. I don't think it's possible to
really restrict shopping, other than to control their access to
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Where online sites have a practical appeal is in relatively
remote, mall-deprived regions. For Anna Morton, 14, who lives in
central Oregon in a small town called Sisters, the closest town
with stores that appeal to her is 18 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very mature, literate and excited about the things that
are out there, like books, CDs and software,'' said Anna's mother,
Rebecca Morton. ``But she couldn't get any of it. Now she puts her
baby-sitting money or her allowance into her Rocket Cash account,
and she has the opportunity to manage her own money and get what
she wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Anna has so far bought a sweater from J. Crew through her
account. ``I love it,'' she said, ``because I can be independent
and not have to talk to my parents all the time about what I
want.''
</P>
<P>
   At all three sites, children can keep track of how much money is
in their accounts and track how much they have spent. If the money
runs out, they may not buy anything else until a parent makes
another deposit to the account or extends the credit line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to teach kids to manage their money wisely, to know
that they are going shopping with their own money and when it runs
out, they can't spend any more,'' said Paul Herman, a co-founder of
Icanbuy.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents agree that the accounts teach children fiscal
discipline. Kelly Cirilli of Rensselaer, N.Y., said her 11-year-old
daughter, Stephanie, saves up the money in her Icanbuy account
instead of squandering it the way she used to. ``Instead of
bringing her out to shop all the time, where she wants to waste $10
on candy and junk and stuff like that,'' Ms. Cirilli said, ``I put
$25 into her account every two weeks and she's saving it because
she wants a shirt that costs more than $40.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To promote a more traditional form of money management, some
online shopping sites offer or are planning to offer savings
accounts. At Icanbuy, for instance, children can open a savings or
checking account with an online bank insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. Account holders can watch interest accrue (2.57
percent on savings, 6 percent on checking).
</P>
<P>
   To close the account, a parent must mail a signed letter to the
bank, which will in turn mail a check for the balance. Earlier this
month, the Doughnet site added a feature to allow children to make
payments from their accounts to the National Resource Defense
Council or the Rain Forest Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those sorts of things are useful because they have a big
educational component for kids,'' said Don Blandin, president of
the American Savings Education Council in Washington. ``Kids use
the Internet every day, and they're going to grow up managing their
money over the Internet. It will be commonplace for this
generation. I just would like to see more places on the Internet
that focus on saving and investing.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the majority of online shoppers under age 18 are not
donating to charity or setting up online savings accounts, some are
learning first-hand about saving money. Jordan Ray, for example,
``even asked his grandmother to take him to rent the video games he
was considering buying, so he could test them,'' his father said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to waste money on something I don't really want
or need,'' Jordan said, as if that were the most natural idea in
the world. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sites Where Children Can Learn to Budget &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sites below offer online accounts that parents can set up
for their children to shop with, and in some cases, to save with.
To ease parents' concerns about privacy and safety, three of the
four sites have created secure payment mechanisms. They all insure
that under-age shoppers can spend their money only on merchandise
from approved retailers. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ICANBUY: www.icanbuy.com &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aimed at children aged 8 to 18, Icanbuy connects shoppers to 22
online vendors, including Etoys, CD Now and 999 Software. The site
requires a minimum balance of $1; a parent deposits money into the
account with a credit card. Children can then spend it without
having access to a parent's credit card account information.
</P>
<P>
   Parents can set limits on the amounts of purchases. For
birthdays and holidays, kids can create a wish list of items that
grandparents and others can check before buying a gift.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers also can use money from their accounts to make
donations to such charities as the Special Olympics or the World
Wildlife Fund or to set up a savings account that earns 2.57
percent interest at Security First Network Bank, an FDIC-insured
online bank that has its headquarters in Atlanta. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DOUGHNET: www.doughnet.com &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Started in June 1999 and aimed squarely at teen-agers, Doughnet
connects shoppers to 31 online vendors, including Barnes &AMP; Noble,
Toys ``R'' Us and Egghead Software. Instead of opening the account
with a deposit, a parent uses a credit card to establish a credit
line with a guaranteed minimum balance of $50. Whenever a shopper
makes a purchase, Doughnet provides the merchant with the parent's
account information and the parent's credit card is charged.
Parents can limit the amount of purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers can also donate to such charities as the Natural
Resource Defense Council and the Rainforest Alliance. The site
plans to add FDIC-insured online banking. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ROCKETCASH: www.rocketcash.com  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This site is aimed at children aged 10 to 18 and offers
connections to 38 vendors, including Amazon.com, Kaybee Toys and J.
Crew. To establish an account, the site requires a minimum balance
of $25; a parent deposits money into the account with a credit
card. Then, children can spend it without having access to a
parent's credit card account information. Parents can limit the
times of day during which a child may make a purchase. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ALLOWANCENET: www.allowancenet.com &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This site for preteen-agers is scheduled to make its debut Sept.
13. With an emphasis on earning and saving, the site will collect
no money from children or their parents. To open an account, a
parent and child will choose from an online list of 112 chores,
deciding which ones the child must perform to earn a weekly cash
allowance (from the parents) or ``diditz'' credits from the site.
</P>
<P>
   Children will check off the chores as they perform them; at the
end of each week they will print out a ``bill'' and present it to
parents to be paid. The ``diditz,'' meanwhile, will accumulate on
the site and children will be able to spend the credits on
merchandise provided by the sites' advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   According to AllowanceNet officials, payment security measures
are unnecessary because users of the site do not spend real money.
As AllowanceNet signs up more users and adds cash transactions,
they added, it will begin encoding them.

<P>
   Contrary to widespread public opinion, the danger of a nuclear
confrontation between the United States and Russia has not receded.
</P>
<P>
   During the NATO-Yugoslavia war, the tension between the two
powers rose to some of the highest levels since the Cuban missile
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told NATO, the Americans, the Germans: 'Don't push us toward
military action. Otherwise, there will be a European war for sure
and possibly world war,''' said Russian President Boris Yeltsin on
April 6.
</P>
<P>
   Even former President Mikhail Gorbachev, the man who did more
than anyone else to end the Cold War, said that U.S. ambitions to
exercise global hegemony were risking ``even, perhaps, a hot war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand that if we want to cause you a problem
over this, we could,'' said Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the Foreign
Policy Committee in the Russian State Duma, or parliament.
``Someone, we don't know who, could send up a missile from a ship
or a submarine and detonate a nuclear weapon high over the United
States. The EMP (electromagnetic pulse that destroys electronic and
computer equipment) would take away all your capability.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in response to the bombing, Anatoly Kvashin, chief of the
Russian General Staff, said, ``If the question `is to be or not to
be' for Russia, we must use everything we have in the armed forces,
including nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Last December, during the NATO bombing of Iraq, Yeltsin, erratic
and in failing health, also threatened world war. Such comments
should not be dismissed as mere rhetoric or hot-headed talk. It's
no secret that Russia is going through a highly volatile period,
and its instability makes the rest of the world that much less
secure.
</P>
<P>
   There are its political upheavals and multiple prime ministers,
but Russia is also in grievous economic distress, has no practical
recourse to conventional (non-nuclear) military capability and has
a deteriorating weapons command-and-control infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has little money to maintain its equipment, to train its
forces or to replace broken and defective machinery. It cannot even
pay its armed forces personnel regularly. Mistreatment of ordinary
soldiers is so rife that people are afraid to send their sons into
the military. The suicide rate among recruits is high.
</P>
<P>
   In response to this military weakness, Yeltsin in April approved
``a blueprint for the development and use of nonstrategic nuclear
weapons,'' which would modernize some of the tactical and
short-range weapons Russia removed from its arsenal several years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   This is a major step backward _ a severe setback for arms
control and disarmament. The gains of the hopeful first years after
the fall of the Berlin Wall, when U.S. and Russian leaders could
act in concert, are being rapidly eroded.
</P>
<P>
   There is little prospect that START II, the treaty that would
reduce Russia's nuclear arsenal from 6,000 to about 3,000 warheads,
will be ratified in the absence of new actions by the United
States. Although negotiations are set to resume, it is clear that
the Russian reliance on nuclear weapons is unlikely to change
without a U.S. move that is sensitive to Moscow's security
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In the Russian military, there is a widespread feeling that in
the event of a conflict with NATO, the country has no usable
military muscle other than nuclear weapons. As such, even
Gorbachev's actions to remove battlefield nuclear weapons from
their arsenal may be reversed.
</P>
<P>
   As for the West, the talk remains aggressive. In its new
strategic doctrine announced at the April summit, NATO did not rule
out deploying tactical nuclear weapons of its own. But nuclear war
between Washington and Moscow looms as reality now, during these
times of increased political ambiguity and tension, not so much
from a deliberate command as from accidents, miscommunications or
computer foul-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Only four years ago, a communications error between the two
countries almost did lead to nuclear war. In 1995, Russian radar
detected an incoming missile fired from Norway, and this set off a
nuclear alert. The black suitcase for the initiation of a nuclear
attack reached President Yelltsin. The world was only a few minutes
away from the brink.
</P>
<P>
   The initial trajectory seemed to be that of a missile fired from
a forward-based U.S. Trident submarine. The alert was called off
when the projectile began to follow a course that turned away from
Russia. In this case, Russian radar and command systems actually
did work. What did not work properly was the U.S.-Russian
communication system.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had issued only a routine warning of a joint
U.S.-Norwegian research rocket launch, even though it was aware
that the device resembled a Trident missile.
</P>
<P>
   On the Russian side, the warning of a research mission was lost
in the bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all found ourselves under stress,'' Antoly Solokov, the
commander of the Russian radar forces, told The Washington Post.
``An officer on duty reported detecting a ballistic missile which
started from the Norwegian territory. What kind of missile is it?
What is its target? We were not informed.''
</P>
<P>
   A look at past crises shows that misunderstandings and false
nuclear alerts are indeed more likely to occur during times of
tension.
</P>
<P>
   On top of all the turmoil now in Russia comes the threat of the
Year 2000 _ or Y2K _ bug. By all accounts, nuclear warheads or
missiles will not go off due to malfunctions of computer chips or
software. They will require some human command. But there is
vulnerability within the communications infrastructure _ including
the messages to the satellites that detect incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and the United States had a program to address Y2K's
potential nuclear command-and-control problems. They were planning
to create a computer communications center, staffed by U.S. and
Russian military personnel. But when the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia
began, the project was put on hold. By now, U.S.-Russian
cooperation has improved, but work on the joint communications
center is still suspended.
</P>
<P>
   So far as Russian equipment is concerned, the most urgent need
is funding to fix the problems. There is widespread concern that
there may be electrical power and telecommunications failures. It
is difficult to be confident of the claims of Russia's nuclear
military officials that they are successfully addressing the
problems, given the mess at the top in Russia _ the lack of funds,
difficulties of organization and deteriorating infrastructure, not
to mention Yeltsin's unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   The first step the United States and Russia should take to
reduce the risk of nuclear weapons is to move them off of
hair-trigger alert. In 1994, Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin
announced, with much fanfare, that they were ``de-targeting''
nuclear weapons. This is not the same as de-alerting. In fact,
detargeting barely makes a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Detargeting changes the coordinates in the programmed commands
of a nuclear system away from the intended target, but this can be
reversed in less than one minute by simply punching new target
coordinates into a keyboard. The small gain, de-targeting, is
entirely unequal to the task of reducing nuclear risk.
</P>
<P>
   Without bold new moves on the part of the United States, serious
nuclear dangers are likely to persist. While current U.S. law
prevents Clinton from reducing strategic nuclear forces below START
II limits of 3,000 to 3,500 strategic warheads, he can still take a
number of initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   _ He can declare that the United States will not initiate a
first strike.
</P>
<P>
   _ He can assure Moscow that NATO expansion is not aimed at
Russia and specifically not intended to bring nuclear weapons
closer to that country's borders.
</P>
<P>
   _ He can remove all the nuclear bombs that the United States has
stationed in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   _ He can remove U.S. Trident submarines positioned near Russian
waters. Such forward deployment is very dangerous and provocative.
</P>
<P>
   _ Above all, he should place nuclear weapons on de-alert status
to eliminate, as much as technically possible, the danger of
nuclear war by accident or miscalculation.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to accurately predict the risks of the Y2K bug,
especially given the wobbly nature of the U.S.- Russian
relationship and the lack of funds and time to address the issue in
Russia. But the risks of a nuclear launch due to communication
failure must be eliminated _ no matter how small a threat officials
feel it might be.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should take the initiative to de-alert its
nuclear weapons before the end of the year and work with Russia to
get a reciprocal action. The specific measures taken in the coming
weeks and months should be the sort that would make it physically
impossible to rapidly launch a nuclear strike in response to
detection of an incoming missile.
</P>
<P>
   Such measures would ensure that Y2K-related problems do not
result in a mistaken nuclear launch and that the gains in nuclear
risk reduction will endure into the next century.

   Contrary to widespread public opinion, the danger of a nuclear
confrontation between the United States and Russia has not receded.
</P>
<P>
   During the NATO-Yugoslavia war, the tension between the two
powers rose to some of the highest levels since the Cuban missile
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told NATO, the Americans, the Germans: 'Don't push us toward
military action. Otherwise, there will be a European war for sure
and possibly world war,''' said Russian President Boris Yeltsin on
April 6.
</P>
<P>
   Even former President Mikhail Gorbachev, the man who did more
than anyone else to end the Cold War, said that U.S. ambitions to
exercise global hegemony were risking ``even, perhaps, a hot war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand that if we want to cause you a problem
over this, we could,'' said Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the Foreign
Policy Committee in the Russian State Duma, or parliament.
``Someone, we don't know who, could send up a missile from a ship
or a submarine and detonate a nuclear weapon high over the United
States. The EMP (electromagnetic pulse that destroys electronic and
computer equipment) would take away all your capability.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in response to the bombing, Anatoly Kvashin, chief of the
Russian General Staff, said, ``If the question `is to be or not to
be' for Russia, we must use everything we have in the armed forces,
including nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Last December, during the NATO bombing of Iraq, Yeltsin, erratic
and in failing health, also threatened world war. Such comments
should not be dismissed as mere rhetoric or hot-headed talk. It's

CUOMO WORKING VACATION TO HIGHLIGHT ERIE CANAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo plans to hike, bike,
canoe and fish his way across upstate New York next week to
highlight the tourism potential of the historic 524-mile Erie
Canal.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, Cuomo will
announce a total of $100 million in federal assistance to help
revitalize the region. Upstate New York has lagged far behind other
regions that have benefited from the 1990s economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo's itinerary takes him eastward from Buffalo starting on
Aug. 15. With stops along the way for biking on the Erie Canal
towpath, boating on Cayuga Lake and other activities, the trip ends
Aug. 19 in Green Island, a small Hudson River community north of
Albany.
</P>
<P>
   There, Cuomo and Rep. Michael McNulty, D-N.Y., will participate
in the opening of sewer and water lines funded through a $700,000
Department of Housing and Urban Development grant. The lines make
possible construction of an upscale 188-apartment complex along the
river, complete with shops and a small marina. McNulty's father,
John McNulty Jr., is the mayor of Green Island.
</P>
<P>
   Economic development in upstate New York ``is not going to
happen by osmosis or prayer,'' Cuomo said in a telephone news
conference with Rep. James Walsh, R-N.Y., who will join Cuomo in a
fishing expedition on Skaneateles Lake. ``It's going to happen by
developing an intelligent plan and executing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo's trip comes on the heels of First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton's ``listening tour'' through the region, which focused in
part on how best to jump-start upstate New York's sluggish economy.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo denied that his trip and the funding announcement were in
any way designed to boost the first lady's possible bid to win the
New York Senate election in 2000. Clinton is weighing a run for the
seat being vacated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat who is
retiring.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and the first lady are spending part of their
vacation in upstate New York at the end of August.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo, a native New Yorker and son of former New York Gov. Mario
Cuomo, brushed aside a question on whether he would throw his hat
into the ring should Hillary Clinton choose not to run.
</P>
<P>
   HUD's Canal Corridor Initiative has already brought more than
$200 million in federal spending to the region, according to
department figures. The aim, Cuomo said, is to turn the canal and
connecting waterways into a major tourism destination through new
marinas, restaurants, recreational businesses, parks, walkways and
bike paths.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo's visit also will accentuate the region's historic sites.
Cuomo is scheduled to tour the Elizabeth Cady Stanton home and the
Baldwin House, which are part of the Women's Rights National
Historic Park in Seneca Falls. National Parks Service Director
Robert Stanton is expected to join the secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo noted that the canal, which was completed in 1824, was the
driving force of the region's economy through much of the 19th
century. It linked New York City, Albany and other points on the
Hudson River to Buffalo and the Great Lakes in the era before
extensive railway and road networks.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing, which once dominated the region, has dwindled
since World War II as manufacturers relocated plants to the South
and overseas to take advantage of cheaper labor.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism, Cuomo said, has the potential to revive the region's
fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan and Walsh have commissioned the National Park Service
to study making the canal a national historic area. Such a
designation by Congress would involve the park service with local
and state governments and historic preservation groups in
developing the canal for tourism, according to Jim Pepper,
assistant director for the park service's northeast region.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, park service visitor centers and rangers could help
visitors better understand the canal's historic significance, he
said.

   LA-SHOOT-RDP (Los Angeles) _ A phalanx of local and federal law
enforcement officials announced that Buford O. Furrow, the suspect
in the shooting of five people at a Jewish community center here
Tuesday morning and the murder shortly afterwards of a letter
carrier, had escaped a huge police dragnet by taking a taxi to Las
Vegas, where he turned himself in at the office of the FBI. The
five people shot at the community center, including three children,
are recovering, although one 5-year-old boy was still described as
being in critical condition after 6 hours of surgery. The murder of
the letter carrier, a Federal employee, could bring the death
penalty for the person convicted of the crime. A roundup by James

   ALUMINUM-MERGERS (Undated) _ Alcoa Inc., the world's largest
aluminum producer, said Wednesday that it wants to buy Reynolds
Metals Co., a troubled aluminum maker that is nonetheless the
industry's third largest player. The announcement comes less than a
day after three huge Alcoa rivals _ Alcan Aluminium of Canada,
Pechiney of France and the Alusuisse Lonza Group of Switzerland _
announced that they would merge, creating a $21.6 billion behemoth
called Alcan that would knock Alcoa, which had $15.5 billion in
sales last year, off its No. 1 perch. If Alcoa does nab Reynolds,
the combined company would have had $21.3 billion in sales last
year, putting it back within breathing distance of the top spot. In
fact, since the new Alcan derives only $17.4 billion of its sales
from aluminum, in a sense it could catapult Alcoa back to the top.

MIDI, THE GOLD STANDARD FOR DIGITAL MUSIC COMPOSERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ERIC TAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The music industry is now battling over which technology _ MP3,
Real Jukebox or some other scheme _ should become the standard for
listeners who want to download small, secure, good quality audio
files from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Composers, on the other hand, have had a standard workable
digital form for years. Musical Instrument Digital Interface, known
as MIDI, gives composers, using a computer and special software,
the ability to simulate the sound of an entire symphony orchestra
or quickly change a composition's key, instrumentation and tempo
and hear the results instantaneously. And it doesn't require a
single performing musician.
</P>
<P>
   MIDI is an industry-standard protocol that lets composers easily
connect a computer with a keyboard and musical synthesizers.
</P>
<P>
   Before MIDI was adopted in 1983 by a group of musical instrument
manufacturers, electronic musical instruments used different
methods to connect to one another, often making it impossible to
use two from different manufacturers. MIDI changed all that,
analogous to the way that SCSI and USB allow all printers and hard
disks to connect with PCs using standardized cables.
</P>
<P>
   To compose and edit music on a PC, a musician purchases a
low-cost MIDI interface box for less than $100, which connects to a
computer via the serial port. Or he can install a MIDI card. Music
sequencing software like Cakewalk Pro, Steinberg Cubase or Mark of
the Unicorn Digital Performer is used to record the notes, as well
as the composition's instrumentation, key and length.
</P>
<P>
   To play music in real time, a controller, which can be a
MIDI-compatible keyboard or wind or string instrument, is added.
The set-up will also include at least one synthesizer, which
actually creates the sounds. Some synthesizers manipulate samples
of different instruments that have been stored in its memory. Those
sounds are then fed to an amplifier and speakers to become audible.
</P>
<P>
   With this MIDI-compliant package, a composer today can create
compositions that to most listeners sound as if they are actually
being played by scores of musicians seated in a concert hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``MIDI gives composers the musical equivalent of a word
processor,'' said Thomas Dolby Robertson, founder of Beatnik, which
produces technology to deliver high-quality music and sound over
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A MIDI-compatible computer can control up to 16 different
channels on each of an infinite number of synthesizers that can be
chained together, giving composers the ability to create music with
innumerable layers of sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike MP3 or the other musical compression formats, MIDI files
are not composed of musical sounds; rather, they are digital
instructions telling the synthesizers what notes to create, how
long to play them and with what intensity.
</P>
<P>
   MIDI's small file size makes it ideal for CD-ROM games, in which
space is at a premium. A game player hears music because the disk's
embedded MIDI data instructs the PC sound card to create certain
notes. But those notes are not embedded in the game itself.
</P>
<P>
   Composers, equipped with very expensive synthesizers, use MIDI
to create compositions that would be impossible or extraordinarily
expensive to perform with live musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Rona, who has composed musical scores for the movie ``White
Squall'' and the television shows ``Chicago Hope'' and
``Profiler,'' uses MIDI and computer sequencing software to create
compositions performed by virtual orchestras. Changing the sound
from a violin to a cello or tuba is a simple matter of the PC
instructing the synthesizer to use a different instrument.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson samples unusual sounds, like crickets and trees
falling in the forest, and then using MIDI commands instructs the
synthesizer to substitute those for cymbals and bass drums.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the complications of human speech, the MIDI standard
will remain confined to controlling tones, like instrument sounds
and sound effects, that can be accurately sampled and then
reproduced electronically by synthesizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voice sampling is rarely done,'' said Tom White, president of
the MIDI Manufacturers' Association. ``Speech is extremely
complicated. There are so many nuances, mouth shapes and tones that
it's very difficult to create virtual speech from a recorded
sample.''
</P>
<P>
   Some MIDI software programs have a ``humanizer'' element that
ever-so-subtly alters tempo and dynamics so that the music does not
sound machine-perfect. But can music created using synthesizers and
sampled tones, and controlled by MIDI devices, ever sound exactly
like the real thing?
</P>
<P>
   ``MIDI-created music can't, because physical sounds are
intrinsically linked to underlying physical gestures,'' said David
Mash, vice president of information technology at the Berklee
College of Music in Boston. ``If you play a violin sound on a
keyboard, you can't play the keyboard as if it's a violin.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're one person, trying to perform 15 different parts
of a composition by yourself, you've got to try and inject those
missing personalities that would be there in a live performance.
It's very difficult to do so. Still, it's a lot cheaper than hiring
a whole symphony orchestra.''

THE FEEL OF CINEMA, BUT A GAME AT HEART 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Very few people realize that computer games are not interactive
movies. The average non-gamer sees a moving image on a screen, sees
some sort of input device, be it a keyboard, mouse or joystick, and
figures that two plus two equals four.
</P>
<P>
   But new media is never a matter of simple addition. Television
does not equal radio plus pictures. Games and movies are as
different as newspapers and sky writing. Maybe more so.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: Drakan, a fantasy adventure game developed by
Surreal Software. What you see on the screen is an epic saga
starring a beautiful young woman who finds and befriends a dragon.
Together, they fight the forces of evil and fulfill their heroic
destinies against a series of awe-inspiring landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   The characters are compelling. The animation is gorgeous. The
action is well paced. There's a strong narrative. Superficially,
it's cinematic. On a visual level, it's easy to draw parallels to
films like ``The Highlander'' or ``Dragonheart'' and to assume that
Drakan took shape in a similar way: a script, a storyboard, camera
angles, editing and voila, mythic adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could be further from the truth. ``It all starts with
the game play,'' said Alan Patmore, Drakan's lead designer. ``At
first, we really wanted to do an underwater game. But our original
publisher had six underwater titles coming out, so they told us to
come back with an original concept. So I thought, well, if you're
flying over land, why not dragons?''
</P>
<P>
   So using exactly the same game dynamics, a team of software
developers built the dragon, Arokh, and some terrain for him to fly
over. ``But just the dragon by itself wasn't enough fun,'' Patmore
said. ``We needed a human character. And the reason we chose a
female character was to play well off the dragon game mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dragon is strong and burly, shoots massive destructive
weapons _ a style of game play that's personified by male
characteristics. So we came up with Rynn, who's more skillful with
her weapons and uses her brain _ stealth and agility instead of
brute strength, which is more in line with a female character.
</P>
<P>
   ``So instantly, we had a great relationship between the two of
them. We had to come up with a story justification for that, which
is that Rynn and Arokh are bound, and the story ties that in with
them exchanging life and knowing each other's thoughts and that
sort of thing. We wrote the story around the game play. But the
game play is the story _ as you play through, it unfolds like a
book.''
</P>
<P>
   In a book, you can see characters' development because the
author lets you inside their heads. In a film, you see characters
develop in dialogue. In a game, character development is a
reflection of the player's development; the character's growth is a
function of what you've accomplished in the course of play.
</P>
<P>
   In last year's hit Nintendo game Zelda: the Ocarina of Time,
this is pretty blatant: at the beginning of the game, when you
don't know how to do anything, the hero is a little kid. As you
progress through the world and become more skillful, he literally
grows up.
</P>
<P>
   In most computer games, including Drakan, the process is more
subtle. In the beginning, you're a little unsure of what's going
on. You're bold _ you have to be to fight. But you're not really
confident. And neither is Rynn, and you can see that in her stance
and hear it in her voice.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that is scripted. But it's also a reflection of your own
(lack of) skill. Rynn's stop-and-start movement, hasty rushes and
blind stabs are a mirror of your own.
</P>
<P>
   Further into the game, you get better weapons, tougher armor and
magic potions, and you know how to use them. You're more confident
and capable, and so is she. ``Since you're controlling Rynn, that's
reflected in the game play,'' Patmore said. ``That's where you get
a sense of character development. And that's where it gets really
tricky _ synching up the character's in-game development with the
player's perceived abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, it's like driving. Cars have personalities (part
engineering, part design, part advertising). They seem to know what
they're doing when (italics)you(end italics) do. Your driving skill
and experience is evident on the road. And the story of your
driving experience is a function of your movement through a
landscape. The speed and the exact route are up to you. The traffic
and the weather are beyond your control.
</P>
<P>
   Computer games are more like driving than they are like cinema.
And despite the Hollywood production values, game design bears
almost no resemblance to what happens on a movie set or in the
editing room of a film studio. It's not about shuffling images to
tell a story.
</P>
<P>
   It's about positioning objects in three-dimensional space so
that other people's stories can happen. Where are the curves, and
when do you tunnel through the mountain? How many goblins are in
the tunnel, and how easy is it to find the treasure?
</P>
<P>
   ``The landscape is designed to lead the player,'' Patmore said.
``Essentially, the way we designed the level flow is a big bowl
area, which is very open, and then a choke point. But you can do A,
B and C in any order to get through that choke point. Most of our
levels have mountain ridges surrounding everything, and you can't
fly over them because the air is too thin or something. Gamers tend
to accept that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Logically it doesn't make sense. But there are technical
limitations. Drakan is much more of a world than any other game
right now. But it still is a series of geometry that if you'd look
from a top-down view, ends a quarter mile to the left.''
</P>
<P>
   Scratch the surface of a millennial game world, and you'll find
a 15th-century map. Beyond the last charted island, the world ends.
And at the edges, there be Dragons.
</P>
<P>
   Drakan, published by Psygnosis; CD-ROM for Windows 95 and 98;
$44.95. Rated M, for ages 17 and older; there is a parental lockout
code that eliminates the gore for children.

PEACE, LOVE AND QUAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESQUITE, Texas _ More than 1,000 computer game fanatics, many
of whom had not been exposed to natural light in weeks, came to
this sun-baked Dallas suburb last week to roam through virtual
rooms and hallways, shooting as many opponents as possible, all in
the spirit of fun.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of spectators at Quakecon 99 ``oohed'' and ``ahhed''
and applauded at particularly skillful ``frags,'' or kills, as when
a leaping contestant, nailed squarely by a rocket-propelled
grenade, vanished in an air-burst of bloody mist.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 tournament was held less than four months after two
Colorado teen-agers, both of them apparently regular players of
Quake and its predecessor game, Doom, roamed through their high
school, firing real bullets, setting off real bombs and killing 13
real people before turning their guns on themselves. The murders
prompted much condemnation of extreme violence in computer games
like Quake.
</P>
<P>
   But this gathering of the world's best Quake players was a
virtual love-fest, and was far less violent than Woodstock '99. It
was an opportunity for hundreds of people who had known one another
only through virtual combat over the Internet to meet face to face.
In many cases, even members of the same Quake teams, known as
clans, met for the first time at the conference.
</P>
<P>
   The main game was Quake 3: Arena, which is expected to be
available to the public sometime this fall, perhaps around
Halloween. The game, which immerses the player in a series of
claustrophobic, three-dimensional buildings, will be released, for
the first time, not only for Windows computers, but also for Apple
Macintosh and Linux machines. It has not yet been rated, but is
expected to be limited to mature audiences due to its copious
display of animated violence and gore.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament games were held on 32 identical computers and
21-inch monitors provided by Advanced Micro Devices Inc., one of
the sponsors. Each computer contained a new 650-megahertz AMD
Athlon (K7) microprocessor and an ATI Rage Pro 128 graphics
accelerator card. Neither the Athlon chip nor the Rage Pro 128
board is available to the public yet.
</P>
<P>
   The standard keyboard was the Logitech Deluxe 104 USB and the
standard mouse the Wingman USB Gaming Mouse, but contestants often
brought their own favorite keyboards, mice and lucky mousepads.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred participants lugged their own computers to
Mesquite from as far away as British Columbia and Nova Scotia,
Florida and California. Several players came from Europe. It was a
three-day tournament, and some players boasted of getting three
hours of sleep over its course.
</P>
<P>
   Because all of this violence occurs in the virtual world of a
computer network, the scene at Quakecon 99 did not look much
different to an observer than, say, mission control at the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration: row after row of computer
screens glowing in a quiet, dimmed room. Indeed, because game
players typically demand the most powerful PC's available, and
because the network constructed for the event was designed to be
extremely robust, there was sufficient computing power at the game
conference to have run the New York Stock Exchange or a large
corporation.
</P>
<P>
   The action on the computer screens was so frantic that some
players complained of vertigo. The noise of the carnage on screen
would have been deafening, but almost everyone wore headphones.
</P>
<P>
   For a rousing battle-of-the-sexes match between teams of female
and male Quake players, Apple Computer provided a bank of blue and
white G3 desktop computers. While many gamers expressed gratitude
that Apple had been a co-sponsor, no one voiced a preference for
the Mac G3 over any Windows-based PC as a gaming platform.
</P>
<P>
   John Carmack, the co-founder of Id Software and principal
developer of Quake 3, is considered one of the top 3D graphics
programmers in the world and is consulted regularly by computer
companies on hardware design issues. ``The iMac with the Rage Pro
accelerator is the very bottom end of graphics needed to run this
game,'' he said. ``The iMac is not a great platform for 3D
graphics.'' Still, Carmack said, he plays his game mainly on a G3
Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Hammans of Dallas, known to fellow Quake competitors as RiX,
was the defending champion and the favorite to repeat at Quakecon
99. When he was in top shape, he said, he used to practice 5 hours
a day _ 12 to 16 hours a day for two weeks before tournaments _ and
once went undefeated for 18 months in deathmatches _ a type of
Quake game in which the objective is to kill the opposing players _
and won 3 major tournaments in a row.
</P>
<P>
   But then he took a day job with Ion Storm, a game development
company led by the former Id programmer and Doom creator John
Romero, and his game-playing time has shrunk. Now, he said, he
tries to squeeze in a half hour of practice after work.
</P>
<P>
   The hazards of holding a day job quickly became evident: He
played well but fell in an early round, and finished in 6th place.
</P>
<P>
   Kornelia Takacs, a shy, slender 22-year-old Web page designer
who moved to Los Angeles from Budapest 6 years ago, is considered
to be not only the finest female Quake player, but also a contender
for any tournament title. (She is also one of the few to use her
given name as her Quake name.) But a trip back to Budapest this
summer kept her from playing Quake 3 until just two weeks ago, and
although she led the women to a narrow victory in the special
battle of the sexes over a team of men led by John Carmack, she did
not finish in the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 30 women showed up to compete, a small number compared to
the estimated 1,000 men and boys there, but significant because
earlier contests were nearly all male.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday afternoon the main event was down to two undefeated
finalists, George (DieharD) Myshlyayev of Richmond, B.C., and Tim
(Bane) Santaniello of Potsdam, N.Y. Hundreds of players gathered to
watch the final deathmatch on giant video screens.
</P>
<P>
   The final match was not close. DieharD put on a clinic of mayhem
and dispatched Bane, 18 frags to 5. Myshlyayev, a 21-year-old
computer network administrator who moved to Vancouver, B.C., 4
years ago from Odessa, Ukraine, said he has been training 3 to 5
hours a day for the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the fans watching were Andrew (Hellbaron) Gasparik, 13,
of Farmingville, N.Y., and Ryan (Habib) Fields, 16, of Amarillo,
Texas. Both had played together on the Internet for months as
members of the Vulgar Display of Power clan, but had never met
before. Andrew and his brother Thomas had come to Texas to visit
their aunt, Elena (TerrorMaidN) Kritzer of Kingswood, Tex., who is
also in their Quake clan.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said he plays Quake all day in the summer ``even when my
parents are screaming at me to get off the computer and go do
something outside.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They think it's going to warp my mind,'' he said. ``But my
parents just don't understand. It's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Only rarely did the Colorado killings come up in conversation,
and the general sentiment was summed up by one older player who
said, ``Playing Quake no more turns kids into killers than wearing
Goth clothes turns them into vampires.''
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase H.L. Mencken, the violent games become dangerous
only when they impinge on idiots and excite their hormones.

UNDATED: found out.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No living woman understood those fears better than Lisa. He was
a monster, a person whose menace would not be confined, even by
jail. One day at lunchtime, several months after the attack, the
telephone rang at the home of Lisa's parents. She had moved there
to heal, but now the voice was unmistakable. How had he found her?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll get you,'' she says Sharif told her that day from jail.
``It's only a matter of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the phone went dead.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   For Lisa, Sharif's 12-year prison sentence seemed token
punishment, yet another setback in what she says today was a
struggle to convince a skeptical prosecutor of Sharif's true
menace.
</P>
<P>
   She says that former Assistant State Attorney Gordon Groland
kept insisting that her case didn't fit that of a monster at all,
but of a form of date rape. ``This is going to be really hard to
prove,'' she remembers him saying, as if he were trying to
discourage her from pursuing the case. ``Are you sure you want to
prosecute? Are you sure you want to go through with it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Lisa kept saying. ``You've got to stop this guy. You
can't let him do this again.''
</P>
<P>
   So at a probation revocation hearing in Tracy's case, Lisa
withstood Sharif's hateful stares, and the withering assault by his
defense lawyer. But her own case, as in Palm Beach, would end in a
plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   She was left with Groland's promise: that on the day of his
release, Sharif would be deported to Egypt, ``met at the prison
gates and escorted to the plane.'' (Groland, now in private
practice in Gainesville, declined to comment for this article.
``I've got nothing to talk to you about,'' he said, before hanging
up the telephone.)
</P>
<P>
   A current Gainesville prosecutor, Assistant State Attorney Greg
McMahon, said recently that he did not know why Sharif was not
prosecuted for his brief escape from the Alachua County Jail. In
late January 1984, Sharif bolted with a group of other prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   He was recaptured just in time to enter his plea for the rape of
Lisa. His 12-year sentence was handed down on Jan. 31, 1984. For
the first time in America, Sharif would do time in a state prison.
</P>
<P>
   But not for long. In October 1989, Sharif was released after
serving less than half his sentence. No state or federal officer
was waiting at the prison gates.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Sharif was at work for another company in Midland,
Texas, two weeks later. It was there that he found the love and
adoration of co-workers and friends. The legal system would wink at
him. And in Midland, Sharif would eventually be indicted for rape
again. The tragic sorority that eventually ended with Nancy in
Juarez would claim another member.

UNDATED: could do. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sharif's guilty plea was scheduled for the morning of Aug. 14,
1981. Under the terms of the agreement, Sharif would receive five
years' probation for Tracy's sexual assault. But what was to be a
routine court appearance that day was just one episode in a
dizzying 48 hours, two days that would illustrate Sharif's charmed
existence in the U.S. legal system.
</P>
<P>
   The night before, on Aug. 13, a woman named Ruth left the
Hi-Tide bar in West Palm Beach and was approached by a man who
identified himself as Mike. Mike's car had broken down, he said, so
Ruth agreed to drive him to his apartment. The police report she
filed later says she then accepted his invitation to come up for a
drink.
</P>
<P>
   But when she entered his apartment, he immediately grabbed her
and tried to kiss her. When she refused his advances and asked to
leave, the reports say, he pulled her toward the bedroom, ordering
her to remove her clothes. He punched her in the face several times
when she struggled. Blood spilled from her nose, down her face,
onto her clothes and the white carpeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the floor between the bed and the bathroom,'' Ruth
later said in her handwritten statement to police. ``He began
telling me to take my clothes off. I asked him please for a towel,
and he said no, kicked me once or twice and said he was going to
kill me, and hit me again several times.''
</P>
<P>
   She was punched some more before the assault ended. Then her
attacker abruptly calmed down, asking her to fix him a drink. He
replaced her torn, bloodied shirt with one of his own, and even
asked her for a date the next night.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after Ruth reported her attack, police determined that
her assailant was not named Mike.
</P>
<P>
   ``A suspect in this case is Sharif Sharif,'' an investigator
wrote later that same day. ``He ... has current sexual battery
charges pending, using the same motive.'' But police apparently
never reported the episode to Palm Beach prosecutors handling
Sharif's rape case.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 14, only hours after Sharif pleaded guilty and received
probation for Tracy's sexual assault, he was arrested and charged
with false imprisonment and battery, charges resulting from his
attack on Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   In recent interviews, both prosecutor Scott Richardson, who is
now in private practice, and defense attorney Greg Scott said they
were unaware of the Aug. 13 attack at the time of Sharif's guilty
plea the next day. If they had known, it was almost certain the
deal for Sharif's probation would have been scuttled.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Richardson said, because the Aug. 13 assault
occurred before Sharif's guilty plea and sentencing, it could not
be used against him as a probation violation.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif was released on bail shortly after his Aug. 14 arrest. On
Jan. 11, 1982, a Palm Beach jury found him guilty of simple battery
in Ruth's assault and sentenced him to 45 days in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif's good fortune continued in his professional life, as
well. Eventually fired by Cercoa because of his chronic legal woes,
Sharif and two co-workers headed north to Gainesville, Fla., to
form a new chemical company. Sharif would be the firm's president.
</P>
<P>
   In Gainesville, Sharif's brief marriage ended when he beat his
wife senseless, both the wife and her relatives said in interviews.
A few weeks later, a 20-year-old college student answered Sharif's
ad in the Gainesville Sun seeking a live-in housekeeper. He
attacked on Lisa's first night in the house.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   In the years afterward, Lisa carried the memories of her assault
on March 17, 1983, like a terrible photo album of the mind. Most of
that night in Sharif's Gainesville home had blurred. But at the
moments when he hurt her the most, or the times when she was the
most afraid, it was like ``click,'' a mental photograph of that
moment. Her head smashed against the wall. ``Click.'' More mental
photos when he kicked and punched and raped her. Another ``click''
at the sliding-glass window.
</P>
<P>
   It was there that Sharif threatened to kill her if she screamed.
It was there that Sharif said he had done it before, and promised
to kill again.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa had no doubt, then or later, that he spoke the literal
truth. She saw the evil in his eyes. Several times during her
ordeal, she wished Sharif would go ahead and kill her, too, would
get it over with. But then, after hours when his rage rose and fell
like some evil tide, he stopped. It was as if someone had finally
found the handle to shut off a faucet of venom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I've hurt you,'' he said. ``Do you think you need to go to
the hospital?''
</P>
<P>
   He called her a cab because he didn't have a car, and rode with
her in the back seat on the way to the emergency room. He later
told police that, yes, they had sex, but Lisa had come on to him,
kissing him and wanting to make love.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, his victim had an unassailable personal history
and serious injuries. This time, police knew that Sharif had raped
before. This time, after news accounts of Lisa's attack appeared,
several other women called Gainesville police to report they also
had been terrorized by Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   ``All were so frightened that they were afraid to come
forward,'' Gainesville police Capt. Sadie Darnell wrote 10 years
later to an El Paso federal judge during deportation proceedings
against Sharif. ``Some indicated they thought he would kill them if
he found out.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Now, there was another suspect, one just as compelling.
Andreychak knew he needed at least one more piece of solid evidence
before he could think about bringing the case against Sharif to a
grand jury. But even after all these years, someone out there could
know something that might move the case along. Andreychak wondered
whether this fall might be a good time for a flight to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me,'' Andreychak said one day in May at his Trenton office.
``I have some excitement about this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA
</P>
<P>
   For almost three years in Florida, from 1981 to 1984, Palm Beach
defense lawyer Greg Scott would be a fixture in Sharif's life.
</P>
<P>
   The guy was a brilliant chemist but always seemed in serious
trouble _ rapes in Palm Beach and Gainesville, an arrest for
assault, another for drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   But Scott also couldn't help being charmed by his client. Sharif
was personable, funny and intelligent. He always treated Scott with
respect. Criminal lawyers are used to dealing with the dregs of
society. That in no way seemed to describe Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the rape cases he defended, Scott remembered later,
there was a question of consent, the familiar ``he said, she said''
tango so common in those cases. Sharif maintained the same was true
in the second.
</P>
<P>
   After he was sent to prison in 1984, Sharif disappeared from
Scott's professional life. The lawyer scarcely thought about him
for 15 years, until the day this spring when the reporter called
from Texas. Did Scott know about what Sharif had done in Mexico?
When Scott was told, a long silence followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good God,'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Tracy was 23 at the time, in May 1981, living four floors above
Sharif in Building B of Old Port Cove in Palm Beach. Sharif's
employers had landed him a spot in the exclusive place, which
included a restaurant and yacht club, because he was a hotshot
chemist. But Tracy thought him creepy, always leaving notes on her
mailbox or the windshield of her car. On May 2, she accepted his
invitation to dinner only because he promised mutual friends would
be there, too.
</P>
<P>
   But Sharif was alone when she arrived at his apartment. Sharif
fixed her a drink, something with vodka, told her the others would
be along and left the apartment to pick up some takeout food. Then
the world began to spin. Tracy had taken only a few sips of her
drink, so he must have put something in it.
</P>
<P>
   Frightened, she called her mother, who lived nearby, and was
told to leave Sharif's place immediately. Back in her own
apartment, Tracy called her boyfriend to tell him she had become
violently ill. She assumed that the knock on her door a short time
later was the boyfriend, coming to check on her.
</P>
<P>
   It was Sharif instead. The others were downstairs in his
apartment, he said. Why didn't she come back? When Tracy insisted
that he leave, Sharif forced his way in, grabbed her, threw her to
the ground and started hitting her in the face and head with his
fists. Then he raped her and walked out the door.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, after spending most of the previous night with
police, Tracy returned to her apartment with her mother and father
to feed her animals. Sharif drove up about the same time and smiled
at them, as if nothing had ever happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good morning to you guys,'' he said, smiling cheerfully.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Sharif had another version of that night's events. Tracy had
been drunk, Sharif told his employers and police. She was very
friendly toward him, and it was she who had wanted to make love.
Things had just gotten a little rough.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Gambale, the owner of Cercoa Inc. and Sharif's boss, was
inclined to believe him. Sharif had been fired from his last job in
New Jersey. Something about a padded expense account. But no one
questioned Sharif's genius in the laboratory, a chemist who, in the
words of one colleague, ``could make a bomb out of Bisquick.'' His
talent was such that when Gambale hired Sharif at Cercoa, he
created a department especially for him. Sharif was a great guy. He
was being railroaded. It was Gambale who helped Sharif find and pay
for the highly regarded Palm Beach defense lawyer, Greg Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Little matter that Tracy passed a polygraph test, or that
Sharif's protestations were disgusting lies. Tracy soon realized
the world would be much more inclined to believe the version of her
attacker. Tracy overheard conversations in the yacht club
restaurant, listening as people speculated that she must have asked
for whatever she got. Old Port Cove management asked Tracy to move
from the complex. Only when she threatened to go to the media did
they relent and finally insist that Sharif relocate instead.
</P>
<P>
   But Sharif would not be otherwise punished. Under Florida
sentencing guidelines at the time, the maximum punishment for the
charge against Sharif was 18 months in jail. At trial, Tracy knew
her character would be the issue, not Sharif's. Prosecutor Scott
Richardson told Tracy that probation was probably the best they
could do.

 By MARC KRISTAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three and a half years ago, at the age of 29, Steve
Schlackman bought his first apartment, a 1,600-square-foot loft on
West Broadway between Houston and Prince Streets _ the very
epicenter of Soho _ for (by today's standards) the fire-sale price
of $350,000. Schlackman's eye for a bargain, however, was sharper
than his eye for an interior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like so many New York bachelors,'' his friend Thom Filicia
recalled, ``he had an L-shaped leather sofa, a big TV with speakers
the size of Volkswagens, and a 45-watt halogen lamp in a corner
that was supposed to light the whole place. He was right out of
Playboy living.''
</P>
<P>
   But Filicia added dryly, noting Schlackman's fondness for
sailing and cigars and fine wine, ``His bachelor pad didn't groove
with the rest of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Schlackman, Filicia is at 27 a designer who is
both young and, with a varied client roster, broadly experienced.
The two met in, of all places, Schlackman's loft, where he was
having a birthday bash for his friend Mary Hess, who was also an
acquaintance of Filicia's and who later became the designer's
office coordinator. They are part of a relaxed assemblage of
friends, mostly in their 20s, who _ not unlike the ``Friends'' of
TV _ enjoy a chain-gang-like closeness and are often separated, in
their overlapping connections, by far fewer than six degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Schlackman, who is a medical advertising executive, explained:
``Thom ended up hiring James Duncan, who's also one of my best
friends. John Lowe, who designed my dining table, is Mary's
boyfriend. John and Thom grew up together. We all know each other,
and we're all the same kind of people and we're all like family.''
The pack's nucleus is Schlackman's loft. ``This,'' he affirmed,
``is the central hangout.''
</P>
<P>
   Though hard-working and successful, these young professionals
have yet to abandon the fluid, house-party habits of college. And
theirs is not a demographic that has traditionally had much to do
with design. The change reflects a more esthetically aware age in
which entities like Crate and Barrel and Pottery Barn have
democratized decoration and made it a factor in the lives of many
of those for whom it would have previously been too rarefied or
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Filicia, who works with a staff of five out of a small loft
office in the West 20s, is well suited to this somewhat
unprecedented moment. ``We're very modern in the way we deal with
our clients,'' he said, ``more informal and straightforward _  &UR; not &LR; 
the guy who came in, threw a scarf over his shoulder and said, `If
you keep that chair, I'll throw up.'''
</P>
<P>
   So, he was a good foil for Schlackman, who was already
intimidated by his struggle with a space that, though impressive,
refused to yield to his ministrations. ``It was basically your
leftover-parents bachelor apartment,'' he said. He was particularly
dissatisfied with the ``entertainment center,'' a plasterboard wall
unit that formed the centerpiece of the living room. ``I wanted to
rip it out and replace it. Something nice and built-in.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlackman initially resisted engaging his friend's services,
however, citing the classic concern of the uninitiated. ``I never
understood how a designer, without ever knowing you, could  &UR; know &LR; 
you,'' he said. His resistance crumbled with the arrival of his
parents' 12-foot-long, brown leather sofa, which, in the tradition
of empty-nesters making renovations, they foisted upon him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was this big L,'' Schlackman recalled. ``It cut the living
room off from the dining area. It was brown, the floors were brown,
the windows were brown, and the kitchen was brown.'' At their next
get-together, he finally turned to Filicia, who suggested, simply,
removing the short leg of the L. Their friends carried the
offending appurtenance into the bedroom, resulting in an instant,
striking improvement. With that, a collaboration was born.
</P>
<P>
   The two men agreed to begin, informally and on a modest budget,
with the front half of the loft, a 16-by-36-foot space
incorporating the living, dining and kitchen areas. The result,
they decided, should be as comfortable for a 60-person party as for
a simple dinner a deux _ a design to accommodate not only
Schlackman but the friends who comprise his extended family.
</P>
<P>
   Before they could proceed, Filicia had to uncover his friend's
style. ``My style was really left over from my parents,'' said
Schlackman, who grew up in Oyster Bay, on Long Island. He describes
the family esthetic as ``Ethan Allen and, you know, your basic
furnishings and antiques.'' For three months, Filicia laid out
magazines, and they looked through them. ``I would circle things
and cut things out,'' Schlackman said. Sorting through the
selections, the designer was able to discern his friend's color and
period preferences _ and to focus them, which wasn't always easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd look at leather beanbags and country cabinets and painted
wooden chairs with stenciled ducks,'' Filicia recalled. Gradually,
he nudged his client toward a consistent viewpoint, which turned
out to be, broadly, Soho.
</P>
<P>
   From magazines, they progressed to Coconut Company, Salon
Moderne, Moss and other furniture stores within blocks of the loft,
where they would weigh selections to see whether he had taste he
could afford. In time, they purchased a pair of well-priced Hans
Wegner side chairs that epitomized Schlackman's newfound style, and
the process was set in motion.
</P>
<P>
   To delineate the primary living space, they first selected a
rug, a tan Greek key-patterned wool Tibetan. The rug, in turn,
dictated the next decision, which was to ebonize the floor. ``When
we put it down, and the floors were light,'' Schlackman said, ``it
sort of died.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the entrance opened directly into the apartment, with a
wall to the left and the living area to the immediate right,
Filicia decided to create what he called a ``virtual'' hallway, by
staining the 42-inch-wide strip of floor that flows from the front
door to the rear bedroom area a lighter red oak color. He also
extended the metallic-silver paint on the left-hand wall the same
42 inches onto the ceiling, strengthening the sense of a separate
zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could be 100,000 years old, and I would never think of
that,'' Schlackman said. He was equally pleased with the
nine-inch-deep glass-topped box of birch plywood that Filicia had
built and installed behind the sofa. ``It was just this big couch
against this big wall,'' Schlackman said. ``The box is almost like
a frame.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He resisted, however, when the designer selected three
metallic-finish paints for different parts of the room. What
changed his mind was the realization that Filicia was apportioning
the budget wisely _ painting the offending plasterboard built-ins
an elegant dark green, rather than replacing them with costly
construction.
</P>
<P>
   Schlackman also recognized that working with a designer, as with
any creative partnership, demands faith. ``I sort of had to let it
go and see what happened,'' he said. ``I couldn't tell him no,
having no idea what I was talking about.'' The result, which
includes a gold wall in the dining area, gives the long, slightly
boxy space sparkle and variation.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, work and play began to blur. At Schlackman's Sunday
dinner parties, friends drift in and out of the open kitchen,
cooking and eating around the center island. A conventional dinner
table, he and Filicia observed, would never do. The solution was
Lowe's oval-shaped, anodized-aluminum and steel dining table with a
top that moves hydraulically up and down. Schlackman keeps it at
the island's height, with tall dining chairs. For a more formal
living situation, the table can be lowered and chairs exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   A persistent problem was finding a cocktail table large enough
to accommodate the 12-foot sofa. At Ligne Roset, he discovered a
stainless steel-topped table with a bench that nests beneath it
that worked perfectly. When within weeks the top became scratched,
Schlackman, encouraged by his designer, decided to refinish it
himself, using a fine-grain sandpaper for a uniform patina. Filicia
added a glass top.
</P>
<P>
   Most satisfying, for both men, was the positive feedback from
their extended family. ``Everything would be validated when all the
friends would come over,'' Schlackman said. ``It was kinda nice.''
</P>
<P>
   The process, and the result, have given Schlackman not just an
esthetic and an education but also a home that suits his needs.
Work will begin soon on the second phase of the design, the bedroom
and master bath. And his old furniture? Schlackman smiles with
evident satisfaction. ``I'm giving it to my parents.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (STORY ENDS HERE. OPTIONAL SIDEBAR FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   TIPS ON MATERIALS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The tools to try some of Thom Filicia's ideas are as close as
the nearest hardware store, but the techniques require care and
patience.
</P>
<P>
   For best results, the Ralph Lauren Duchesse Satin
metallic-finish paint that Filicia used ($36.99 a gallon at Janovic
Plaza) should be applied, over a standard base coat of semi-gloss
enamel, with a high-volume, low-pressure spray gun, in several
light coats. (Ralph Lauren recommends thinning the paint first,
with water or a conditioner called Floetrol; for more details:
800-379-7656). You can use a roller, but Mike Geyda, the owner of
Independent Island Contracting in Seaford, N.Y. (516-783-1573), who
painted Schlackman's loft, said that Duchesse Satin is ``soupy''
and that it requires three or four carefully applied coats to
eliminate roller edges and to achieve a uniform patina.
</P>
<P>
   Geyda, the general contractor for the job, built the simple
behind-the-sofa birch plywood box (about $2 a square foot) and
attached a power strip to one side to compensate for the outlet
that he covered. To make a perfect floor line between the virtual
hallway and living room (detail above), he meticulously laid down a
strip of painter's masking tape with a minimally invasive adhesive
backing, to not damage the newly sanded floor.
</P>
<P>
   For the living room, he ragged on a coat of Minwax Ebony stain
($7.69 a quart at Janovic) and let it dry. Then he moved the tape
to the other side of the line and ragged on two coats of Minwax Red
Oak stain for the virtual hallway. Both were covered with three
coats of water-based Varathane ($60.39 a gallon at Janovic), which
Geyda said dries quickly and doesn't yellow.
</P>
<P>
   The dining table, with a black anodized-aluminum top and a base
of cold-rolled steel, was designed by John Lowe (212-473-4829) and
fabricated by Product and Design (718-858-2440). It can be raised
from a standard height of 29 inches to 37{ inches, using what Lowe
called ``a very strong version of a standard office chair lift.''

<P>
   Then came the bombshell in 1997. Within a few weeks, he had
shared his memories of Sharif with a detective from Gainesville,
Fla., where Sharif had been convicted of rape. That detective
introduced Pascoe to Mexican authorities. In late May 1997, Pascoe
was on a flight to Orlando, Fla., to meet with Juarez investigators
at the Mexican Consulate.
</P>
<P>
   Local cops tended to find Pascoe a little weird, overly obsessed
with Sharif. Some were disinclined to believe him. But the Mexicans
were keenly interested in what Pascoe had to say, particularly
about the Egyptian's predilection for underage girls. During their
three-hour interview that day, a young Mexican detective named
Manuel Esparza told Pascoe that Sharif probably killed several
Mexican girls.
</P>
<P>
   Esparza's words made Pascoe ill.
</P>
<P>
   NEW JERSEY
</P>
<P>
   With the news from Mexico, detectives along the path of Sharif's
American odyssey began to comb their files of unsolved homicides.
Mexican detectives believed that over and over in Juarez, Sharif
had demonstrated his taste for blood. What were the chances that he
had acquired that terrible thirst in America?
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1999, Chris Andreychak, a detective with the
New Jersey State Police, would be one who wondered. Twenty-two
years before, Andreychak's first case was the 1977 slaying of a
pretty flight attendant named Sandra Miller. With each passing
year, the mystery of Miller's death grew more impenetrable, the
chances of justice more remote.
</P>
<P>
   Then, this spring, Andreychak heard of Sharif, a murderer and
womanizing serial rapist from Mexico. Before Mexico, Sharif had
immigrated to America, coming to New York in 1970. About the time
Sandra Miller was killed, Sharif worked at a New Jersey plant less
than two miles away. Sharif and Miller, Andreychak would learn,
drank at the same bar. Every new detail seemed to point toward
Sharif as a suspect, not away. After 22 years, Chris Andreychak had
a new suspect in his first case, the case that had haunted him for
so long.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Miller attended a Bible college and as a young woman
contemplated a career as a missionary. Her life took a different
turn when she applied for a job at an Eastern Airlines ticket
counter. She was pretty, brunette, bright and personable, so the
company encouraged her to become a flight attendant instead. But
Miller would always be tenderhearted and concerned about the poor.
Before flights to places such as the Dominican Republic, she
collected clothes to distribute to needy children who lingered
around the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was also a social creature, visiting bars and nightclubs
and talking to the guys who inevitably approached her. If they came
on too strong, she'd back away. But friends worried that her
affability would be misinterpreted as teasing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sandy, one of these days you're going to do this to the wrong
guy and you'll get into trouble,'' a friend, an Eastern pilot named
Terry Harrison, said to her not long before she died.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she replied. ``I know what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Late on Jan. 3, 1977, Harrison's concerns seemed prophetic.
After a flight that night, Miller drove home from Newark Airport,
stopping at a Dunkin' Donuts along the way. Her killer was
apparently waiting when Miller pulled up to the remote farmhouse
outside Flemington, N.J., where she lived with her 5-year-old
daughter, Korin, and an elderly couple named Fitzer.
</P>
<P>
   Police later found evidence of a fierce struggle near the
farmhouse, blood in the snow and clumps of Miller's hair. Her
attacker forced her into a car and drove a few miles across the
Delaware River into Pennsylvania. In a heavily wooded area near the
river, Miller was either dumped on the side of the road, or jumped
from a moving car in an attempt to escape. She died of a single
stab wound just as a police officer managed to reach her.
</P>
<P>
   The crime stunned residents of that pastoral part of New Jersey.
The investigation headed by the New Jersey State Police was
predictably intense, but ultimately fruitless. Detectives
interviewed more than a hundred of Miller's friends and relatives.
Two weeks later, however, when asked by a local reporter what was
new with the case, one investigator grumbled, ``Not a damn thing.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   It had been nearly two decades since Sharif worked there, but
during a visit to Magnesium Electron's plant last May, Andreychak
found a handful of employees who remembered him. Sharif, they said,
was not the sort you would ever forget.
</P>
<P>
   Andreychak listened as they described Sharif's drinking, his
wrecked cars and his obsession with women. Sharif hungered for a
different female every night of the week. With the hours he spent
in the bars, particularly a joint called the Kingwood Inn less than
a mile from the plant, Sharif could almost pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   To Andreychak, that last tidbit was the most important. He knew
from reading old reports that Sandra Miller also frequented the
Kingwood. Miller was an attractive woman in her 30s, newly
divorced. Put the two of them together in a small joint and it was
almost guaranteed they would have met.
</P>
<P>
   Andreychak had developed another suspect after taking over the
case, a local man and longtime acquaintance of Miller who
detectives later learned was capable of great violence. After the
man's death from cancer, officers recovered a large knife like the
one used to kill Miller, but they were never able to gather enough
evidence to close the case.

UNDATED: no simple answer. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HOPE, PA.
</P>
<P>
   The bombshell landed in January 1997. John Pascoe had a
chemistry degree of his own by then and was at work in his lab
smock for a New Jersey company. He noticed a visitor waiting for a
meeting and offered her a cup of coffee, and when they got to
chatting, the name of a mutual acquaintance soon popped up. The
visitor said that years before, she had worked with Sharif Sharif
at a place called Magnesium Electron, a small chemical company set
in the countryside of southwest New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know where Sharif is now?'' the woman asked in Pascoe's
office that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``In prison for murder,'' Pascoe replied, jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you know, then,'' the woman said.
</P>
<P>
   The blood drained from Pascoe's face as he listened. His onetime
drinking buddy now sat in a Mexico jail cell, linked to the murders
of more than a dozen young girls and women. Pascoe almost ran to a
telephone to call his mother.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   They had met in New Hope, Pa., a small artists colony on the
western side of the Delaware River, only a 30-minute drive from the
New Jersey chemical company where Sharif Sharif worked. John Pascoe
was 17 that summer of 1978, a dark-haired high school diver who
lived with his parents in a complex of condominiums in the hills
above the village square. One day, as he lounged by the pool with
several local cheerleaders, a stranger in his early 30s approached
and immediately began flirting with the girls, almost drooling over
them, it seemed to Pascoe at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, you're pretty,'' said Sharif, as he introduced himself to
the girls. The tall, ruggedly built guy with short, dark hair and a
mustache often followed up with an invitation. ``How about coming
over to my place for a drink?''
</P>
<P>
   Sharif offered the sophistication of an older man, with handsome
Arabic features that bore a passing resemblance to those of another
Sharif, the dashing star of the movie ``Dr. Zhivago.'' The teen-age
girls in New Hope jumped at his advances. They were gone just like
that, drinking with Sharif in his new residence, a ground-floor
apartment a few hundred yards from the pool. A few of them, Pascoe
eventually knew, would find their way into Sharif's bed.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way Sharif was, definitely a magnet for young girls.
Several times during the next two years, Pascoe would pop over to
Sharif's apartment and find another pretty waif, sometimes looking
no more than 14 or 15 years old, asleep on the sofa, or lounging
around his place, or in his bed. Pascoe would look at Sharif, as if
to ask, ``How do you do it?'' and Sharif would just smile and
shrug. Then, in a day or two, the girls would be gone.
</P>
<P>
   Was it Pascoe's imagination, or did Sharif become even more
sinister as the months passed? He thought of the day the pair went
deer hunting, when, after Pascoe wounded a buck, Sharif tortured
the quivering animal, poking it with the barrel of his rifle,
kicking it, waltzing around it with orgasmic glee. There was the
way he lovingly fingered his huge, red-handled hunting knife, the
look of madness that sometimes came into his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   But the thing with the shovel and the girl was the last straw,
the thing that would haunt Pascoe for years afterward, despite the
taunts of his skeptical family.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1980, sometime in the spring. Pascoe had popped over to
Sharif's apartment one afternoon and found another young girl
waiting there, petite, pretty, with long, light-blond hair, and
wearing a tube top and bluejeans.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif was gone, so the two of them got to talking inside. As
much as he tried in the years to come, Pascoe couldn't remember
many details from their conversation _ particularly the girl's name
or where she said she was from. He did remember that her few
belongings _ a pair of sneakers, bluejeans and a couple of shirts _
were sitting on the floor of Sharif's living room, piled into a
cardboard box the size of a milk crate.
</P>
<P>
   Within a day or two, the girl was gone, which was typical. But
with this girl, there was something strange. Her stuff was still in
Sharif's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's the girl who was here?'' Pascoe asked Sharif on his
next visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's gone, and she's not coming back,'' Sharif replied,
smirking.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean she's gone?'' Pascoe asked. ``That's her
stuff in that box right there. She'll come back to get her stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharif realized then that Pascoe had been in his apartment
without Sharif knowing. He flew into a rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ever do that again ... '' Sharif screamed. ``Get out!''
</P>
<P>
   Pascoe wasn't about to argue, and he hurried for the door. It
was on his way out that he saw a new shovel, caked with fresh mud,
standing against a wall on Sharif's front porch.

COMPUTER IMAGING CAN HELP DOCTORS EVALUATE BRAIN LESIONS IN
STROKES 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By JESS DHALIWAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ask any neurologist about treatments for stroke victims and the
likely response will be a frustrated sigh. Because the treatment
options are limited, the half-million people who suffer from
strokes each year rely on the success and speedy approval of
experimental drugs. Doctors who treat patients with such drugs say
the only way to gauge their effectiveness is to wait for outward
physical changes in the patient, which can take as long as three
months.
</P>
<P>
   In the search for accurate tools that can tell what is happening
inside the brain within days, not months, research scientists are
looking to computer imaging. The technology being developed would
give doctors a reliable and consistent way to measure the volume of
brain lesions _ the dead or endangered tissue _ that result from
strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could tell you accurately in five days instead of weeks
when your mother or father will be able to come home and if he or
she is going to be in a wheelchair,'' said Dr. A. Bernard Pleet, a
neurologist at Bay State Medical Center in Springfield, Mass.,
which is working with researchers at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   The two institutions are in the early stages of designing a
computer program that will interpret a set of magnetic resonance
images, or MRIs, and give doctors a virtual look at the dead and
dying regions of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   A complete MRI consists of many images, or ``slices,'' of the
brain, and to determine the volume of the lesion, radiologists must
add up the volumes of each slice, a process that is as tedious as
it is subjective. The technique also has a 20 percent error,
according to Dr. Steven Warach, chief of stroke diagnostics at the
National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.
</P>
<P>
   While the damaged area of the brain is fairly easy to identify
on an MRI scan, it is more difficult for radiologists to determine
the precise line between healthy neurons and endangered ones. ``A
lesion is a very ambiguous thing,'' said Don Geman, a University of
Massachusetts researcher. ``If you asked two doctors about its
boundaries, you would get two different answers.''
</P>
<P>
   So if doctors can't agree on lesion borders, how can they train
computers to? With the help of statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Lesions show up as bright, white blobs on MRIs. The intensities,
or degrees of brightness, of the lesion also vary in different
areas of the brain. By digitizing sample areas of lesions as well
as non-lesion background, the computer can be programmed to measure
the range of intensities inside and outside the lesion and form a
mathematical description of each area.
</P>
<P>
   The program can then separate the lesions, the damaged areas,
from the background by scanning the MRI image in cubic sections
that are eight voxels _ measurement units like pixels, but in three
dimensions _ on each side, and measuring their intensities. This
allows the computer to describe the area as lesion or non-lesion.
</P>
<P>
   After the entire lesion has been evaluated, the computer then
measures it by laying voxels in the affected areas, much like a
carpenter laying tiles.
</P>
<P>
   Once the lesion has been filled with 8-by-8-by-8-voxel segments,
or ``tiles,'' the computer maps the edges of the lesion, where
8-by-8-by-8 tiles cannot fit, in 4-by-4-by-4 tiles, then
2-by-2-by-2 and so on, in a method called statistical packing. To
find the volume, the computer simply adds up the tiles that meet
the mathematical intensity requirement for the lesion.
</P>
<P>
   Because of fluctuations between MRI scans and what the
researchers call ``random noise'' in the system, the estimated
volume will still have a margin of error. Preliminary tests on some
artificial images have yielded a 5 percent to 10 percent error.
</P>
<P>
   But consistency, not lack of error, is the aim of the
researchers. As long as the program misses the mark by the same
amount each time, doctors will be able to track the volume of the
lesion precisely and identify even a slight decrease in response to
treatment, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all the information were contained in a single slice of the
MRI, or if a surgeon could just slice a person's head across and
put it on a table and look at it, then doctors might indeed be able
to do a better job than computers,'' said Dr. Joseph Horowitz, one
of the University of Massachusetts researchers. ``But the computer
is just better in this case because it will give consistent
results.''
</P>
<P>
   Statistical packing can also help build a 3-D image of the
lesion. Because of the box-by-box method, the image appears blocky,
as if it were made of Legos. To smooth the image into an organic
form, the program produces a virtual rubber sheet that molds around
the statistical model, a technique called active contour modeling.
``It senses brightness and darkness and is drawn to regions of
darkness,'' Horowitz said of the rubber sheet. ``Any time it is
being drawn to something that appears sharp, it is going to resist
it because a region with sharp contrast indicates there is an
edge.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the researchers have written the code for separating the
lesion from the rest of the image. After they complete work on the
3-D elements, scientists hope to scrutinize the lesion further and
separate the dead tissue from the endangered tissue.
</P>
<P>
   When the program is finished in about a year, doctors at Bay
State will use it to compare experimental treatments and track
patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could make a database of patients, we could show, for
example, that a 10 percent reduction in lesion volume correlates
with a 30 percent improvement of clinical outcome one, two, three
months down the line,'' Pleet said.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps what is most exciting for stroke researchers _ and
stroke victims _ is that there will be a standard and accurate way
to judge the volume of a lesion. That will help in the testing of
new treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This program will be a big help if it is completely objective
and could be used simultaneously at all sites by investigators,''
Warach said. ``Most of the time, drugs fail to reach the high bar
for FDA approval not because they are ineffective, but because of
flaws in trial design and data analysis.''

A SERIAL RAPIST'S SAVAGE TREK ACROSS AMERICA
</HEADLINE>
 
(Part 1 of 3) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 &HT;    _ 
 &HT;    During a four-month investigation for this article, reporter Tim
Madigan conducted more than 150 interviews across four U.S. states
and Mexico. Other information in this article was taken from police
reports, affidavits, transcripts from Sharif Sharif's El Paso
deportation hearings and the 40-page sentencing document written by
the Mexican judge who convicted Sharif of murder in Juarez. Names
of the rape victims have been changed to protect their privacy. 
 &HT;    _

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the sprawling Mexican border city, they speak her name with a
reverence generally reserved for religious icons. Which is fitting,
in a way. For the story of Nancy seems lifted from Scripture _ a
tale of a dark-eyed teen-ager who delivered Ciudad Juarez from its
five-year nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of March 18, Nancy was just one of thousands of
naive, vulnerable Mexican girls riding back and forth to work on
rickety buses from their slums to the foreign-owned factories, the
``maquiladoras.'' These were the girls, more often than not, whose
bodies had turned up in the deserts around Juarez for the past five
years, raped and strangled.
</P>
<P>
   But that night in March, Nancy somehow survived. The
frail-looking girl of 14 was raped, choked and beaten by her
``maquiladora'' bus driver and left for dead, but she stumbled
across the dark desert to safety. She identified her attacker, the
bus driver, causing one ominous domino after another to fall.
</P>
<P>
   The last domino led to a brilliant Egyptian-born chemist. Sharif
Abdul Latif Sharif had moved to Juarez in 1994, and within a year,
the serial slayings of young women began. The scourge briefly ended
in 1995, when Sharif was arrested in several of the killings,
eventually convicted in one case and sentenced to 30 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   But in the twist that would distinguish his crime story from all
others, Sharif's villainy apparently grew when he was placed behind
bars. The Juarez murders started again. From jail, the 52-year-old
scientist became an evil martinet, directing assorted henchmen like
Nancy's attacker to kill for the promise of a few hundred pesos. In
the past five years, at least 57 young women have died. Without the
miracle of Nancy, the young women of Juarez might be dying still.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   But Juarez is only half of Sharif's grim story. The brief flurry
of headlines about Sharif and his crimes there led American readers
to believe that his scourge was contained south of the border. The
truth is something else. The truth is that the sorority of Sharif's
victims that ended with the Mexican girl Nancy actually began two
decades before with a succession of victimized U.S. women.
</P>
<P>
   They were women who had the misfortune of crossing Sharif's path
during his 24-year odyssey across the United States _ victims
beaten, choked, tortured and raped, crimes that foreshadowed the
deeds he is accused of in Juarez.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you try to escape, I will murder you like the rest of
them,'' Sharif told one U.S. victim, Lisa, during a vicious attack
in Gainesville, Fla. That attack occurred 11 years before Sharif
crossed into Juarez. ``I will bury you out back in the woods. I've
done it before, and I'll do it again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the 1980s, Sharif was convicted of sexual battery in
Florida. A third rape charge, in Midland, Texas, finally prompted
Sharif to scurry into Juarez. During the years, several other U.S.
women whispered to police that they had been brutalized by Sharif
but were too frightened of him to prosecute.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif's odyssey included four arrests on drunken-driving
charges in New Jersey, Florida and Texas, and a 1984 jailbreak in
Florida. A New Jersey detective has identified Sharif as a suspect
in the unsolved 1977 slaying of a flight attendant.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Sharif soldiered on toward his terrible destiny, only gently
rebuked by the U.S. legal system. For two rapes, he spent six years
in prison. He escaped prosecution for the 1984 jailbreak. He eluded
deportation back to Egypt, despite a U.S. law that called for
banishing any legal alien who committed two crimes of ``moral
turpitude.''
</P>
<P>
   For in the United States, the Egyptian immigrant was lucky
beyond belief, taking full advantage of considerable personal
magnetism and the ancient stigma attached to rape victims.
</P>
<P>
   He also thrived on the loyalty of his U.S. employers. Sharif was
a scientist of inventive genius. U.S. companies stood to make
millions from his work and helped find for their problematic
employee the finest legal defense available. One Midland, Texas,
company hired him from prison, helped him avoid deportation to
Egypt and stood by him despite growing evidence of his terrible
nature.
</P>
<P>
   He could have been stopped by the legal system, but wasn't. So
now, American women grieve for their Mexican sisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't have to happen,'' Lisa, Sharif's Gainesville victim,
said through tears one day this spring. ``Why couldn't they get rid
of this guy?''
</P>
<P>
   Sharif remains today in a Mexican prison. In a recent interview,
he refused to answer questions about his past. Meanwhile, Lisa's
plaintive question reverberates in two countries. In his American
odyssey, Sharif was a tropical storm, gathering strength over warm
seas. With the man who would inspire comparison to the evil genius
of Hannibal Lecter, there would be no simple answer.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   Which was why the prosecutor was receptive to the proposal
offered in the spring of 1994. Jack Ladd, the corporate lawyer for
Benchmark Research and Technology, was also defending Sharif in the
rape case. Ladd's deal was this: Dismiss the charge against Sharif,
and he would leave the country. Benchmark would set Sharif up with
a lab in Juarez, Mexico, and keep him on the company payroll, Ladd
said. But at least Sharif would be gone.
</P>
<P>
   Schorre agreed. In August 1994, the sexual-assault indictment
against Sharif was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The move to Mexico had been Sharif's idea, Benchmark CEO Wayne
Kinsey said in a recent interview. Sharif had become familiar with
the city during his deportation hearings in El Paso, just across
the Rio Grande. The company's relationship ended with Sharif a few
months after he crossed the border, Kinsey said, but he declined to
say exactly when, or why.
</P>
<P>
   Kinsey said his company cooperated with Mexican and American law
enforcement officials when Sharif was charged with Mexican
slayings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had conversations and meetings with them,'' Kinsey said.
``We've done everything we feel like a good company and good
citizen should have done.''
</P>
<P>
   In another interview this spring in his Midland office, Schorre
explained his handling of Sharif's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted something done on the case,'' Schorre said.
``They were bad allegations even though the case had gotten weak.
We were still trying to get something done that we could find
acceptable. I thought we were doing OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the jarring headlines from south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Mexico looks at it that way,'' Schorre said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a safe assumption. With the deal in Midland, Sharif's
grotesque American odyssey finally came to an end. But almost
simultaneously, a five-year nightmare for the women of Juarez had
begun.

`YELLOW JACK': FEVER DREAM IN A LAND OF MIASMA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By RICHARD EDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Claude Marchand's father, a cobbler, is trying to convince his
son to fill the paternal shoes instead of turning artist. ``There
is no vanity in a shoe,'' the father argues. This was in the early
1800s, long before even the homeliest objects sprouted luxury
versions to meet the specialized needs of the very rich.
</P>
<P>
   Painting, capable of more beauty than shoes, as well as its own
winged kind of locomotion, is generally unsuitable for walking and
susceptible, for lack of such down-to-earth use, to tremors of
vanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yellow Jack,'' Josh Russell's first novel, is Marchand's
story. It has its own moments of vanity, along with considerable
beauty and a complex wit that helps and hurts. The wit gives
scintillating energy to the writing but overburdens the structure.
The story flies enthrallingly for quite a while, but eventually,
tangled in its own wings, it has trouble with a walk.
</P>
<P>
   Marchand leaves painting to become a disciple of photography's
pioneer, Louis Daguerre, at work ``to make sunlight draw a
picture.'' Quarreling with his master, he steals a camera and a
supply of silver-coated plates, flees Paris for New Orleans and has
an early success with the invention even before Daguerre has
announced it. After a series of stormy professional and amatory
adventures, he is stricken with mercury poisoning and drowns
himself.
</P>
<P>
   The novel is haunted by the prolonged yellow fever epidemic that
killed thousands of New Orleaners in the 1840s. As with Camus'
``Plague'' and Stewart O'Nan's ``Prayer for the Dying,'' disease
casts a gray eschatological light over the story. A skull nods
faintly through each vividly animated face; each erotic caper heats
up to foreshadow a dance of death. ``Yellow Jack'' was the city's
nickname for its plague, and the jocularity is reflected in
Russell's feverish picaresque.
</P>
<P>
   He has set imaginary tigers in his real gardens. Marchand and
the other characters are fictional; ostensible catalog entries
about the ``soliotype'' (the impostor-inventor eschews
``daguerreotype'') are interspersed throughout. This beguiles a
little; we get a third-dimension, stereoscope effect as reality and
fiction play tag. It confuses as well, and soon it becomes part of
a problem that one might call a distraction of good things.
</P>
<P>
   As for the real New Orleans, Russell portrays it with convincing
imagination. Not just in the grisly details of the plague but in
the evocation of a febrile, subtropical, multicultural city whose
newspapers came out in separate English and French editions.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the finest writing refracts a mighty particularity: a
woman lifts her face to a freak snowfall. ``The stars have come
loose,'' she calls out as the first flakes brush her tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Penetrating asides enliven the social detail. Marchand and his
camera are presented as special entertainment during a high-society
house party: ``Most came because they were tired of jugglers and
croquet, not because they were amazed by the soliotype. The rich
quickly overcome amazement.''
</P>
<P>
   Marchand's story is told in a swirl of style, delightfully sharp
at one moment, elusive at the next and finally clogged, as if too
many contrasting colors had turned a canvas beige. Arriving in New
Orleans destitute, he commits a series of holdups with a pistol
stolen from Daguerre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forgive me, I am an artist,'' he announces, waving his camera
with his free hand. Earlier he says, ``Consider yourselves not
victims, but patrons.''
</P>
<P>
   Before long he has held up a painter. The fellow artist,
delighted, introduces Marchand to Millicent, his mistress. The
introduction takes place at an orgy where Millicent lies naked
under a mountain of food, and the patrons feast upon both.
</P>
<P>
   She is a prostitute, a light-skinned beauty of mixed black and
white descent and the novel's most real and vital character. The
others, Marchand; Vivian, the Lolita-like child of a wealthy family
who seduces him blithely, grows up wearily to marry him and soon
dies; and Victor, a saintly and cynical doctor, are spectacularly
drawn. Yet they blur after a while, as if the eye through which
they are seen were the yellow fever itself.
</P>
<P>
   Millicent abandons the painter for Marchand. She is his vigorous
agent, passing around a nude daguerreotype of herself among the
rich demimonde and practicing lethal voodoo against rivals and
enemies. She loves him; she is also coldly knowledgeable in the
world's betrayals, including his. Russell's finest achievement is
the froth in which passion in this Creole Moll Flanders churns
along with desolate wit.
</P>
<P>
   There are any number of scenes remarkable not only for their
shrewdness or power but for what is obliquely expressed or
expressively withheld. There is Vivian at 10, spying on Marchand's
rendezvous with a society matron and blackmailing him into
photographing her nude. Later she will seduce him in an opera box;
still later, aware of her susceptibility but deciding to cool
matters, she prescribes two feet as the minimum distance at which
he may stand. Noting the length and squirm of his arms, she
recalculates to four feet.
</P>
<P>
   There is the vivid depiction of how Marchand, his novelty having
faded, recoups with a ghastly new specialty: immortalizing
mortality. Relatives of plague victims bring the coffin to the
studio, remove the corpse and prop it up as if it were simply
asleep. Little dead boys hold a toy, little girls a doll.
</P>
<P>
   Death infiltrates the city and its inhabitants, not so much
because they die _ most do not, of course _ but because it infuses
a denaturing senselessness into their actions, passions and hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after the novel's midway point Marchand, Vivian and
several others, though bizarrely energetic as ever, seem to fail in
pattern and direction. They die on us while still, like the
corpses' portraits, seeming to be alive.
</P>
<P>
   Abstractly it is an interesting device; fictionally it is the
opposite. Except for Millicent, who maintains her abused vitality,
the others play out a sequence of scenes whose exotic character
loses purpose. It is like watching a film zip through the projector
when the lamp has gone out.

UNDATED: your honor.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Witnesses who followed him turned court proceedings into a
virtual love fest. Several letters to the judge from friends in AA
swore to Sharif's increasingly stable sobriety and his example to
others in his Midland group. Colleague after Benchmark colleague
testified about Sharif's rehabilitation and his value to the
company. On that issue, they at times overdid it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think for a moment that I'm going to let him stay
because he's going to line somebody's pocket with gold, you're
mistaken,'' an angry Nail said at one point in the testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But by the final hearing, even Nail confessed to being swayed.
To avoid deportation, Sharif needed to prove his rehabilitation and
his value to American society. He seemed to have done it. In the
final hearing, on July 26, 1993, Nail congratulated Sharif on his
apparent reformation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like you to understand that this is one of the most
difficult cases that I've ever had to decide,'' Nail told Sharif.
``I can't tell you what the decision is at this point. I just have
to look at it and do the very best I can. OK?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, Judge,'' Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   To many in Midland, it thus came as a bitter disappointment when
Nail ordered Sharif's deportation to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   In his 14-page order issued Sept. 28, 1993, Nail acknowledged
Sharif's scientific ability and the strides he seemed to have made
in his rehabilitation. But two drunken-driving arrests in the past
four years ``provide little assurance that the respondent will not
again be an abuser of alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was while drinking, Nail wrote, that Sharif seemed to
undergo ``a remarkable transformation ... much like the principal
character in Robert Louis Stevenson's popular story, `The Strange
Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, it boiled down to money. Those most adamant in their
defense of Sharif also depended on him for their livelihood, Nail
said. Who wouldn't want such a man to remain in the United States?
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the respondent contributes to their livelihood, they are
willing to assume the risk of the respondent's potential for
abusive behavior,'' Nail wrote. ``Individuals who are not benefited
by the respondent's presence may be less willing to assume that
risk, however.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharif's lawyers immediately appealed, a process that could take
years. He would remain free on bail in the interim. And his
employers at Benchmark would continue to demonstrate their loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Ann had seen Sharif before in the various Midland nightspots,
and he always seemed the perfect gentleman, the sort of guy who
could turn a woman's head with his silk shirts and sophisticated
manner.
</P>
<P>
   So on Halloween, Ann had no problem drinking and dancing with
Sharif when they met in a crowded nightclub called the Cactus Moon.
She told him about her children. He spoke of his big house and
persuaded her to pop in and see it, just for a minute.
</P>
<P>
   It was a large, beautiful place in a new neighborhood on the
edge of town. They entered through the garage, and when Ann asked
to use the bathroom, Sharif pointed the way. He was waiting outside
when she came out, and punched her when she refused his advances.
He called her a whore and bitch, and raped her.
</P>
<P>
   Then he poured her a glass of orange juice, chatting amiably,
until his rage swelled back up. She said he raped her again and
again until the sun came up, each attack interspersed with
kindnesses, causing Ann to arrive at the same metaphor used a month
earlier by Judge Nail. Sharif was first Dr. Jekyll then Mr. Hyde, a
monster not content to attack her body. Sharif seemed to need to
mess with her head, too.
</P>
<P>
   But Sharif's defense lawyer didn't seem interested in what his
client had done that night. He wanted to know Ann's history in the
bars, what she wore when she went to nightclubs, whom she had slept
with. The same day she talked to the lawyer, she passed a polygraph
examination.
</P>
<P>
   But as far as Ann knew, that was the end of her case. She had no
idea what became of her accusation, no clue about what had become
of Sharif until that day a few years later when her cousin called
with the news from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   To Midland County District Attorney Al Schorre, the case was a
loser from the beginning. The victim had passed a polygraph exam,
Schorre said, but had given inconsistent statements to police
before arriving at the final version of her attack. She had been
married at the time, and previously left a bar and had sex with a
man not her husband. Sharif insisted the sex between them was
consensual. The case was clearly unraveling, Schorre believed.

UNDATED: with it. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sharif was a charismatic guy, and it had taken even Wilson a few
years to get the true measure of the guy. Wilson was already
employed at the Palm Beach chemical company Cercoa Inc., when
Sharif was hired there in early 1981. Within months of arriving in
Palm Beach, Sharif was charged with sexually assaulting a young
woman in his beach-front condominium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't believe what you read in the papers,'' Sharif told
Wilson. ``I didn't rape her.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Wilson was still willing to take Sharif at his
word. Wilson pitied him, actually. The poor guy seemed to be
getting the shaft from bosses at Cercoa, which was probably behind
his chronic drinking and propensity to twist off. Sharif dreamed of
having his own business, he told Wilson, a place to pursue his
experiments as he wished. Current frustrations were getting the
better of him.
</P>
<P>
   So Wilson stepped up with a solution, which later he'd come to
regret. A family friend in Gainesville offered to bankroll a new
company in the Central Florida college town. Sharif would be the
president and creative force behind the new firm. When established
in 1982, the job would be everything Sharif had professed to want.
But within weeks in Gainesville, the truth about Sharif had become
clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't change him one g--d---ed bit,'' Wilson said later.
</P>
<P>
   He was soon arrested on a drunken-driving charge. A brief
marriage ended one night when Sharif's wife said he beat her
bloody. After each successive episode, Sharif promised Wilson and
his other partners that he would quit drinking for good, abstinence
that generally lasted a week, two at the most.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in March 1983, a 20-year-old college student answered
Sharif's ad for a live-in housekeeper. Sharif attacked the woman
named Lisa on her first night in his house _ punched, choked,
kicked and raped her. And that night, there was a particularly
sinister element to his behavior. To Lisa, he bragged of killing
other women and burying them, and threatened to kill her if she
tried to escape.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said he was appalled after Sharif was arrested in Lisa's
attack. Then it was clear. Sharif was more than a drunk. He was a
psychopath and Wilson was the one who had brought him to
Gainesville, where an innocent young woman had been scarred for
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've done it this time, big boy,'' Wilson told Sharif during
a jail-house visit. ``She's got permanent injuries, and you're not
getting around this one. This time you can't deny it. You can't say
it was consensual.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharif was sent to prison in 1984 with a 12-year sentence, but
spent less than six years behind bars. His new gig in Midland began
immediately after his release. Wilson had no doubt that Sharif
would rape again. And maybe remorse also had something to do with
Wilson's 1991 call to the U.S. Border Patrol in Midland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you who you have out there,'' Wilson told border
agents. ``You have a tiger by the tail.''
</P>
<P>
   Border patrol agents who looked into Sharif's past came to
agree. But within hours of his arrest for deportation in 1992,
Sharif was freed on bail and back at work. In the deportation fight
to come, he would have plenty of allies.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   In the deportation proceedings against Sharif, Capt. Sadie
Darnell of the Gainesville Police Department provided the most
damning evidence. Tom Wilson had alerted Darnell that deportation
hearings seemed to be going in Sharif's favor, which prompted
Darnell's scathing affidavit to U.S. Immigration Judge William
Nail.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, Sharif attacks women while on dates or approaches
them, gives a fake name and states that his car is disabled,''
Darnell wrote to Nail on Nov. 6, 1992. ``Once they are within his
span of control, he physically attacks them, beating them severely,
usually in the face, and rapes them. The (victims) were all
verbally and physically abused. The detectives stated the victims
were terrified, and said Sharif threatened to kill them.
</P>
<P>
   ``His behavior has demonstrated him to be a predator of women
and his repeated irresponsibility of driving while under the
influence of alcohol or drugs endangers everyone,'' Darnell
continued. ``The victims have been irreparably damaged. Please
consider them.''
</P>
<P>
   But the criminal Darnell described could not have been the same
man in Nail's El Paso courtroom, humbly fighting to remain in the
country he said he had grown to love.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif would be his own star witness, insisting during emotional
testimony that his mistakes were long behind him. Therapists were
helping him work through the trauma of his Egyptian childhood, of
being sodomized as a child by his father and other male relatives,
Sharif said. Sharif swore he had stopped drinking. In Midland, for
the first time in his life, Sharif said he had found a sense of
family and inner peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I ... I sit there having nightmares about not being
able to go fishing in the lake and catch bass,'' Sharif testified
on July 28, 1992, during the first of his deportation hearings. ``I
would like to have another chance. I won't let you down, your
honor.''

   Raising four children didn't allow time to dwell much on the
past. But as hectic as a single mother's life might get, Ann could
never forget that night, never be completely over it. The rape was
too terrible, and she had come to know too much about the rapist.
</P>
<P>
   Every month now, it seemed, she learned something new. The man
who attacked her, an Egyptian-born chemist named Sharif Sharif, had
committed rape twice before in Florida in the 1980s. He should have
been in prison. Or he should have been deported. But he was a
brilliant scientist with money, the kind of criminal who could beat
the system, and be out drinking at a Midland, Texas, nightclub on
Halloween night 1993, the night he ran into Ann.
</P>
<P>
   He talked her into visiting his home that night, then trapped
her there, raping her again and again until the sun came up. There
were moments when Ann wondered whether she would live to see her
children.
</P>
<P>
   But then no one believed her horrible story. At the time, Ann
was married, and her husband had been at home with the kids while
she was in the bars with a cousin, celebrating Halloween. That made
her a tramp. She asked for what she got. That's the message Ann
felt she received from Sharif's defense attorney, the police, even
the prosecutors. What jury would believe a woman like her?
</P>
<P>
   So they let him go, let Sharif slither across the border into
Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, in the spring of 1994, and that was that. At
least until a few years later, when Ann's cousin called and told
her the news. Ann went to the public library and found the
newspaper story herself.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif Sharif was a killer in Juarez, the story said. He and a
street gang had been accused of raping and killing many young
girls. Ann felt a flood of relief as she read, thankful that she
was alive. And she felt anger.
</P>
<P>
   They should have stopped him. They should have believed her. She
wasn't a tramp, she was a mother. She didn't deserve to be raped.
None of it should have happened.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Midland is known as ``The Tall City'' because of skyscrapers
that rise from the West Texas desert like a mirage. The oil
business built those impressive towers, a universe full of
self-made entrepreneurs who were not above a few risks to get ahead
in a cutthroat world.
</P>
<P>
   And there was no question that hiring Sharif Sharif was a risk,
at least to the reputation of Wayne Kinsey's Midland company,
Benchmark Research and Technology. Sharif carried two convictions
for Florida rapes on his resume, and when the company first
contacted him, he was still in a Florida prison.
</P>
<P>
   But he had been a good prisoner, officials there said, and the
time behind bars did nothing to lessen Sharif's professional
reputation as a chemistry wizard capable of devising ways to make
oil wells more productive. When Sharif was released from his
Florida prison in 1989, he was at work for Kinsey within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And to use a term from the trade, Sharif was a gusher. Industry
buzz quickly began, admiring talk of the innovations coming from
the small company in Midland. In short order, Sharif developed
three patents and had 10 more pending. He was worth big money to
the company. Were it not for the business generated by Sharif's
inventions, many Benchmark employees would not have jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Even the U.S. Department of Energy had expressed interest in
Sharif's work. One happy photograph seemed to symbolize it all. It
was Sharif and U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm, shaking hands and smiling in
Sharif's Benchmark lab, looking down on a row of Sharif's beakers.
</P>
<P>
   Even his personal demons seemed assuaged by the professional
success. Twice in his first three years in Midland, Sharif was
arrested on drunken-driving charges, but bosses chalked that up to
difficulties adjusting from prison. Sharif insisted he had become
sober after the last arrest in 1991, and was dutifully attending
therapy and several meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous a week.
</P>
<P>
   Convicted rapist or not, there came a time when friends in
Midland thought so highly of Sharif that they trusted the man
around their children.
</P>
<P>
   It was such a shock, seemed like such a shame, that day in April
1992, when federal agents appeared in Midland with handcuffs,
telling Sharif he was up for deportation.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Sharif's colleagues, past or present, were so
enamored. Tom Wilson had worked with the Egyptian chemist for three
years in Florida, witnessing both his technical acumen and the
spiral into drunkenness and violence that in 1984 caused Sharif to
be imprisoned for sexual battery.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson knew that Sharif should have been deported after his
second Florida rape. That's what federal immigration law said _ two
convictions for crimes of ``moral turpitude'' and a legal alien
like Sharif was gone. But Sharif had a knack for falling through
the legal cracks, and it had happened again. The dangerous sexual
predator somehow managed to fly completely beneath the radar of the
U.S. Immigration Service, and Wilson was not about to let him get
away with it.

HAM RADIO DEVOTEES WHO TAP INSTEAD OF SPEAKING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, N.J.)   (af)  
 By CATHERINE GREENMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twice a day at 8 a.m. and 7 p.m., Macalee Hime goes to her
``shack,'' the room where amateur radio enthusiasts keep their
radios, and turns on her Kenwood 570d. Mrs. Hime, whose call sign
is AB5TY, tunes the dial to 7.038 MHz. Before long, she hears from
other ham operators, telling her that they have tuned in.
</P>
<P>
   Thus begins another session of Queen Bee Net. The 51 members of
the group have been congregating over the radio for the last five
years, mostly just to talk about the weather, their families, or
what they ate for breakfast. During one recent session, about 10
members tuned in from areas like Idaho, Florida, Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful way to visit with folks,'' said Mrs. Hime, a
retired court reporter who lives in Goldthwaite, Texas. ``We stay
on for about an hour or so, so everyone gets a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Queen Bee Net is one of many groups, or nets, organized by
amateur radio buffs. But where the majority of these hams
communicate by voice, Queen Bee Net, and other nets like it,
communicates only through Morse code.
</P>
<P>
   Although Queen Bee Net does not adhere to strict requirements
like the Chicken Fat Operators, which restrict membership to
operators who can tap and interpret Morse at 40 words per minute,
or the Old Old Timers Club, where 40 years of wireless operating
experience is required, all of these nets share a passion for Morse
code, and a commitment to keeping it alive.
</P>
<P>
   Many could just as easily use their ham radios to speak, or for
that matter, could pick up the phone or send messages over the
Internet. So what incites them to keep tapping?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very relaxing to concentrate on something so different
from the rest of the day,'' said Nancy Kott, North American
representative of Fists, an organization founded in 1987 that
promotes the use of Morse code on the ham radio. (``Fist'' refers
to the distinctive style in which a ham operator transmits Morse
code.) ``You put on your headphones and enter your own little
world. You don't think about your problems when the person you're
communicating with is going along at 40 words per minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Communicating via Morse code indeed requires a great deal of
focus. Each letter of the alphabet, numerical symbol and
punctuation mark in Universal Morse code (the most widely used code
in the United States and Europe, and an adaptation of the original
or ``American'' code invented in 1844 by Samuel F.B. Morse), is
represented by a combination of dots and dashes.
</P>
<P>
   Single units of space, or pauses, separate letters, while words
are separated by spaces the length of seven dots.
</P>
<P>
   Although most people now learn Morse with the help of
audiotapes, reading and memorizing the symbols used to be the
common way to learn. Either way, it can take months to learn Morse,
and years to achieve tapping speeds over the 20 words per minute
average.
</P>
<P>
   Automatic telegraph keys, also called paddles, have helped speed
up tapping rates, but many Morse enthusiasts still stick to
semiautomatic bugs, or manual straight keys, which resemble
staplers in the way they move up and down when tapped.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is a language of sorts, the pride of understanding
Morse code translates into a certain camaraderie among Morse
tapping hams _ one that would not necessarily be found, say, in an
Internet chat room. ``There's a significant amount of commitment
required to learn this technique, and that may be a motivation to
be polite, and to foster the kind of communication that was popular
in the history of code communication,'' said Tom Perera, a ham
hobbyist in Montclair, N.J., who has a collection of over 400
telegraph keys.
</P>
<P>
   Although men far outnumber women on ham radio, female hams who
work in Morse code say they are treated with utmost respect by male
hams. It is considered bad form, for example, to ask how old
someone is. Instead, all women are known as ``YLs,'' short for
``Young Ladies,'' while men are ``OM,'' short for ``Old Men.'' And
the notion of being asked what you are wearing is virtually
inconceivable in the Morse world.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more gentlemanly behavior relaying Morse code than
you'd find on the Internet,'' Ms. Kott said. ``If they find out
you're a woman, they're more excited that you're interested in the
hobby. They encourage you rather than hit on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Hams have a shorthand of their own, known as Q signals.
``QTH?,'' for example, means ``What's your location?'' while
``QSP'' means ``Please repeat the message.'' Numerical shorthand,
including ``73,'' which means ``Best regards,'' and ``88,'' which
means ``Love and Kisses,'' is also universally known.
</P>
<P>
   But with communication technology ever escalating to new
heights, some Morse enthusiasts worry that the skill they wish to
preserve may soon be undermined by new government regulations.
</P>
<P>
   At present, all ham operators are required to obtain a license
from the Federal Communications Commission. There are currently six
classes of licenses, ranging from No Code Technician, which
requires no knowledge of Morse code, to Extra, which requires a
proficiency of 20 words per minute. Traveling up the license ladder
gives a ham operator access to broader radio frequencies.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to simplify the amateur radio service license
structure, the FCC has proposed reducing the number of license
classes from six to four, a step that could reduce the Morse code
requirements in the lower-level licenses.
</P>
<P>
   This is a disturbing thought for many Morse enthusiasts, many of
whom maintain that Morse is still a fail-safe mode of communication
in emergencies and should, therefore, still be required.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is generally acknowledged that Morse signals can get
through in certain noisy radio conditions when other modes, such as
voice, might not, the United States military and Coast Guard
recently phased out Morse code in their operations. It was replaced
with the Global Maritime Distress Stress and Safety System, a
system that uses satellites and computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morse is not a modern area of communications,'' said William
Cross, a program analyst at the FCC. ``There are still maritime
frequencies where people communicate through telegraphy, but it's
no longer part of any government safety system.''
</P>
<P>
   Morse enthusiasts also have more personal reasons for wanting to
maintain the standards. ``Morse is a skill and learning it is not
fun, but if you don't have the requirement, people aren't going to
do it,'' Ms. Kott said. ``If I hadn't had the requirement, I would
have lost out on a lot. Lowering the requirements would be taking
away the opportunity for a lot of people to discover Morse and the
huge role it played in history.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority of all hams, however, would like to see the license
structure reworked, according to Bob Inderbitzen, customer service
supervisor for the American Radio Relay League. ``There will still
be a Morse test for access to shortwave bands, but this is an
opportunity to pull things apart and see how we can attract more
people to ham radio. Morse is a smaller element of a much larger
group of operating modes. Hopefully, the new structure will reflect
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wherever the FCC proposal leads, the Morse code hams will
continue to seek each other out. ``Morse code is a lovely old
skill, like navigating by the stars,'' said the writer Tom
Standage. Standage's book ``The Victorian Internet'' (1998, Walker
&AMP; Co.) compared the emergence of Morse telegraphy in the 19th
century to the 1990s Internet. ``Many people feel we are losing
something if we allow these old ways to die out, and it's wonderful
there are people who are keeping it going.''

<P>
   The large family lived in a Juarez slum, and if Nancy wanted
fancy new outfits, she would have to pay for them herself, the
girl's mother told her. So Nancy, then only 14, lied about her age
when she applied for work at the maquiladora. On March 1, she
started work on the assembly line of the factory called Motoros
Electricos.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later, she was the last passenger on her bus, coming
home after midnight from her shift at the plant. But the driver did
not stop at her colonia, driving instead into the desert. The
driver laughed and asked if she was afraid. Alone amid the cactus
and blowing garbage, the driver attacked, grabbing Nancy around the
throat and squeezing until the world became black.
</P>

   Then angels intervened. What other explanation could there be
for her survival, when so many others had died? She awoke in the
desert, missing a sneaker and a leg was out of her pants. She
stumbled through the night toward a light, and found a shocked
peasant who called the police.
</P>
<P>
   In the whirlwind of the next few days, Nancy would identify her
attacker, the bus driver Jesus Manuel Guardado. Guardado in turn
fingered three other drivers, and another man, Victor Moreno. For
more than a year, police said these men had roamed the city,
sometimes cornering victims in their factory buses, sometimes
snatching them from the street to rape and kill. Guardado told
police and a judge that 20 young women died that way. The group was
officially charged in seven deaths. But the sordid conspiracy did
not end there.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The two met one day in fall 1997. Moreno, an El Paso resident
and convicted drug dealer, was introduced to Sharif while visiting
another prisoner at the Juarez jail. The two quickly became
friendly, and Sharif found a taker for a familiarly murderous
proposition, according to Moreno's later statements to police.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian would pay $1,200 for the murders of four girls each
month. Four girls was an unreasonable request, Moreno argued. The
two men settled on two bodies a month instead, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno cashed in each month after producing for Sharif articles
of the victims' clothing, most often her panties, and clippings
from the newspaper. The continuing source of Sharif's money remains
a mystery, police now say. One thing seems certain, however: If not
for the miracle of Nancy, the women of Juarez would be dying still.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Sharif Sharif's charmed life ended at the new state prison at
the base of the mountain. In April, as the public relations
nightmare escalated, he was moved from his cozy jail accommodations
in Juarez to a maximum security unit in the prison outside the
state capital of Chihuahua.
</P>
<P>
   He is now a five-hour drive from Juarez, in a cell only a few
meters wide. Guards keep him under constant surveillance. His
telephone calls, letters and visitors are monitored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would tell the women not to worry about Sharif for ...
years,'' Jesus Jose Solis Silva, the state official in charge of
its prisons, said one day in his Chihuahua office.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno and the drivers are behind bars in Juarez, each of them
charged in seven slayings. In a country without jury trials, where
a judge renders a verdict after receiving documents from the
prosecutors and defense, they will likely spend years awaiting the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Police say that they are awaiting additional evidence, but that
Sharif is sure to be charged in the same killings. He is now linked
to the slayings of at least 20 women and maybe as many as 37.
</P>
<P>
   Under Mexican law, he can be sentenced to no more than 40 years
in prison, no matter how many killings he committed. In the Castro
case alone, he will be eligible for parole in 15 years, but police
say it is unlikely that Sharif will be released before his full
sentence is served.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be eligible for parole, you have to prove you are no longer
a threat to society,'' said Julio Yanez, a senior investigator in
the killings. ``He's a menace. He's been in jail five years, but
he's still as dangerous as the day he got there. His chances of
parole are non-existent.''
</P>
<P>
   So Sharif's real exile begins. The brilliant scientist is now
the historic criminal. With a mountain of evidence heaped upon him
from a dark journey spanning the continent. And the scourge in
Ciudad Juarez has ended.

   In Juarez, Sharif's gilded existence would continue, even behind
the walls of the ``Centro de Rehabilitaci''n Social'' or the
CERESO, the Juarez city jail. There could be no question of the
jailers' kindliness to the accused killer. Sharif's living quarters
had two beds, a television, refrigerator, microwave, fax and
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   From his cell, Sharif called local TV stations to criticize
coverage of his case. Sharif once called an investigator from jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have a daughter?'' Sharif asked.
</P>
<P>
   A 40-page document, issued by a Mexican judge when finding
Sharif guilty of murder, also detailed Sharif's plot to continue
the killings after his arrest. Not long after being jailed, Sharif
handed an envelope to one of his jail-house visitors, a member of a
Juarez street gang called The Rebels, the judge's document said.
The gang member in turn took the envelope to a Juarez pool hall,
delivering it to Sergio Armendariz, a burly man more commonly known
as El Diablo or The Devil. El Diablo, the leader of The Rebels,
opened the envelope and tucked $4,000 into his pocket, gang members
eventually told police.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies again began to appear in the desert, and if anything,
the killings seemed more brutal. After several months of renewed
terror, a disc jockey at Joe's Place, a favorite haunt of both
Sharif and the rebels, told police that one of the recent victims
had partied there. A police sting operation in the bar uncovered
the link between Sharif and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   By April 1996, when police rounded up El Diablo and members of
his gang, 17 more young women had been added to the Juarez body
count. Five gang members were charged in seven slayings, though
police believed the Rebels and Sharif were responsible for as many
as 17 killings. Gang members told detectives that they killed on
orders from Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sharif will give the amount of 1,000 pesos to each person who
participated in the killing of each girl, to die under the same
circumstances as those found in Lote Bravo,'' a gang member told
police. The purpose was ``to have the same physical appearance so
(Sharif) wouldn't be blamed for the murders.''
</P>
<P>
   Some gang members recanted their statements, saying they were
beaten by police. But it could not be denied that with both Sharif
and The Rebels in jail, the killings stopped, a lull that lasted
more than a year. But the bloodiest days in Juarez were yet to
come.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   On March 3, 1999, a Mexican judge sentenced Sharif to 30 years
in prison for the murder of Elizabeth Castro. In Juarez and in
American newspapers, the conviction was noted only in passing. More
newsworthy, it seemed, was the mystery of the killings that
continued to plague Juarez in even larger numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Bodies had started appearing again in the desert in early 1998,
while Sharif was locked in jail. Terrified residents clamored for
action. The number of grieving Juarez residents swelled, and family
members of the victims founded Voces Sin Ecos (Voices Without
Echoes) to protest what they called the indifference and ineptitude
of police.
</P>
<P>
   The slayings became a national scandal, reverberating as far as
Mexico City. In 1998, Francisco Barrio Terrazas, governor of the
state of Chihuahua, was defeated in his bid for re-election, an
outcome widely blamed on the mounting death toll in the state's
largest city. Members of a special state task force created to
investigate the slayings seemed increasingly confounded as bodies
continued to turn up, on the average of every other week. The city
heralded the arrival last spring of FBI agents, called in by the
Mexicans to help.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the city would be delivered not by a detective, but
by the miracle of a thin teen-age girl who dreamed of owning nice
clothes.

UNDATED: terrified frenzy. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two months later, in early October 1995, another dazed young
woman sat bruised and bleeding by the arches that led into Rincones
de San Marcos, Sharif's exclusive neighborhood on the city's
northwest side. The gringo had raped her, Blanca told police that
night, describing her assailant that way because his Spanish was so
broken.
</P>
<P>
   The first sexual encounter with Sharif Sharif had been
consensual, Blanca said. But he wouldn't let her leave his house.
For three days, Sharif kept her captive, beating her and repeatedly
raping her. Sharif threatened to kill her if Blanca tried to
escape, saying that her body would be found with the others in a
patch of desert south of the city, a place called Lote Bravo.
</P>
<P>
   On the third day, Blanca managed to slip away through a window,
and stumble to the neighborhood arches, where a passer-by found her
and called police. Sharif was arrested and charged with rape the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   Only days later, Blanca recanted her story and disappeared,
causing the rape charge to be dismissed. Detectives suspected that
Sharif had purchased Blanca's silence. But by then Sharif was
caught in a larger web.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, the serial murders of the young women had been
happening for months, sometimes one a week. Every arrest for a sex
crime thus earned special scrutiny from police. Sharif, with his
threat to Blanca about Lote Bravo, immediately seemed a
particularly promising suspect, for it was there that most of the
bodies had turned up.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican investigators eventually learned of Sharif's criminal
history in the United States. Twice in the 1980s, Sharif was
convicted in the rapes of Florida women. Other American women
reported brutal assaults at the hands of the same man. In 1993, a
U.S. immigration judge in El Paso ordered Sharif deported back to
Egypt for the two rapes in Florida. Sharif appealed that decision,
and while out on bail in Midland, Texas, was accused of rape again,
a charge that caused him to cut a deal with prosecutors and skip
across the border.
</P>
<P>
   In Juarez, Mexican detectives discovered Sharif's life on
Ugarte, and his affair with the slain Elizabeth Castro. Another
victim, Silvia Elena Rivera Morales, 17, was last seen alive with
Sharif in one of the downtown bars. In yet another case, witnesses
said that Sharif paid 500 pesos, about $50, to the boyfriend of
Olga Leticia Carrillo Perez, Sharif's price for sex with the
17-year-old girl, according to police records. The boyfriend
delivered Olga to Sharif's home, collected his bounty, then left.
Olga's body soon turned up in Lote Bravo with the others.
</P>
<P>
   Little physical evidence was left behind in the killings,
pointing toward an intelligent and methodical killer. Sharif's
intelligence was unquestioned. And because of the circumstantial
evidence mounting against him, police were increasingly convinced
that the brilliant scientist was the primary, perhaps the only,
architect of the city's building terror.
</P>
<P>
   It was a notion further buttressed by the statement of a young
drug addict and exotic dancer, Erika Fierro. Fierro told detectives
that she met Sharif at Joe's Place in May 1995, and when Sharif
asked, Fierro introduced him to nine female friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sharif said the girls I was introducing to him, that he would
have sex with them, then he would take them away and would kill
them, and leave them at Lote Bravo,'' Fierro told detectives. ``I
told him that I was not going to introduce him to more girls, so he
wouldn't hurt them. He said that if I said something, he would kill
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The killings abruptly stopped with Sharif's arrest for the rape
of Blanca. He was later charged with the murder of Elizabeth
Castro, the strongest of the five cases in which Sharif had been
seen with the victims. There was little motive for police to charge
Sharif in the other cases, because in Mexico, multiple prison
sentences cannot be served consecutively.
</P>
<P>
   In what would become a familiar local refrain, Sharif insisted
he was innocent. In December 1995, four years before his murder
conviction, the Egyptian insisted in a jail-house news conference
that the real killer remained on the loose, that the killings were
sure to start again.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Since his arrival in the United States in 1970, Sharif had
enjoyed a charmed life in the legal system, good fortune largely
attributable to his talent as a chemist. One Florida employer who
profited from Sharif's acumen helped pay for an accomplished
defense attorney, and another in Texas continued to support his
problematic employee despite mounting evidence of Sharif's dark
character.
</P>
<P>
   Benchmark Research and Technology in Midland hired Sharif
directly from a Florida prison, and kept Sharif on its payroll for
at least a few months after his move to Mexico. Rumors in his new
Juarez neighborhood had it that Sharif paid his rent months in
advance.

SERIAL RAPIST EXPOSED AFTER JUAREZ' WORST HOUR
</HEADLINE>
 
(Part 3 of 3) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM MADIGAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a boardroom adjoining the prison director's office, Sharif
Sharif sat behind a long conference table, three burly guards
standing behind him. Sharif looked fit despite a three-week hunger
strike, and was dressed as if for a night in the bars of downtown
Juarez, in a silk shirt and tan slacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian-born scientist smiled as the reporters entered,
mistaking them for a familiar TV crew. He was quickly corrected,
and his smile vanished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will you listen to me?'' he asked that recent day in the
Mexican prison. ``Will you listen to my story?''
</P>
<P>
   No, he was told. He had told his story before, how he'd been
railroaded by Mexican police, how they had no physical evidence to
link him to the killings, how he was a scapegoat. No. There were
other things to talk about now, questions that arose from Sharif's
terrible odyssey across two countries and nearly 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif bolted from his chair, towering over shorter guards who
nervously reached for their guns. He was a large, menacing presence
who filled the room, a man completely in control, against whom even
the prison director seemed cowed.
</P>
<P>
   He had sensed it in an instant. These reporters were a threat.
Sharif would not be drawn into their trap. He was much too smart
for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to talk to you!'' he shouted before walking
angrily from the room, back to his prison cell to resume serving a
30-year sentence for murder. ``Nobody wants to listen to me. I'm
innocent. I never killed anybody in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   But by then his claims seemed ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   It was five years earlier, in May 1994, that Sharif fled to the
border city of Ciudad Juarez from his adopted United States,
crossing the border one step ahead of both a U.S. deportation order
and a rape indictment in Midland, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But for Sharif, life in the gritty city neighboring El Paso
would be more Eden than exile, at least at first. Most of the
city's 2 million residents lived in wretched poverty, tens of
thousands in cardboard shacks with no electricity or running water.
Sharif's home, by comparison, was a spacious, 2-story,
Spanish-style villa with stucco walls and tile roof. He was a
brilliant chemist who joined the Juarez gentry of doctors, lawyers,
architects and drug lords.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps best of all, Sharif would soon discover Ugarte
Street, the seedy strip a few blocks from the mission square in the
bustling downtown, the place in Juarez that was a sexual
psychopath's dream.
</P>
<P>
   On Ugarte and nearby streets, rough taverns like Joe's Place,
Tuna Country, Casino Deportivo, and Noa-Noa's tumbled one unto
another _ lairs of the street gangs who ran the area's drug trade
and prostitution. Hundreds of rickety buses rumbled onto Ugarte
around the clock, depositing thousands of naive teen-age girls with
painted nails and fresh lipstick. They were part of the legion of
workers in foreign-owned factories, the maquiladoras, girls who
made $3 a day, then stepped from their buses downtown and virtually
onto the laps of men who bore them ill.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 57 girls and young women raped and strangled in the
city's five-year nightmare, a scourge that began within months of
Sharif's arrival in the Mexican city neighboring El Paso, many were
last seen alive on Ugarte. At least five of them had something else
in common. Shortly before they died, they had been in the company
of that same Egyptian scientist, a man fresh from a sordid American
odyssey, and headed toward a more terrible destiny in his new home.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   On Ugarte, Sharif was taller than most. He spoke halting
Spanish. And in a world of bluejeans and T-shirts, Sharif favored
expensive watches and gaudy jewelry, silk shirts and turtlenecks,
sports coats and dress shoes.
</P>
<P>
   So the bartenders and waiters of Ugarte Street, the drug dealers
and prostitutes, remembered Sharif. Some said that Wednesdays,
Fridays and Saturdays were his big nights on Ugarte, when the
maquiladora girls were out partying in the greatest numbers. Sharif
often found himself surrounded by the waifs, buying them drinks,
laughing and dancing.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1995, Sharif's attentions seemed briefly
focused on one, a maquiladora girl named Elizabeth Castro. He was
in his late 40s, she only 17, a slender, beautiful girl with long,
dark hair. But they seemed in love, once spotted arriving downtown
together in Sharif's white sedan and, on several other occasions,
sharing a table in the bars, whispering, laughing and hugging.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Aug. 15, 1995, Castro didn't come home from her factory
job. She was dropped downtown by her maquiladora bus in late
afternoon, and was never seen alive after that. Four days later,
her body was found along a highway south of the city. An autopsy
revealed she had been strangled, yet another in a series of
sinister killings of young women that eventually worked Juarez into
a terrified frenzy.

NATO CHIEF SAYS SOMEONE LEAKED TARGETING GOALS TO YUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A NATO ally apparently leaked secret targeting
information to Yugoslav officials during the U.S.-led air war,
according to Gen. Wesley Clark, the American four-star Army general
who heads NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who declined to speculate about who had tipped the
Yugoslavs to NATO's targets, said the security breach was ``as
clear as the nose on your'' face. He declined to say what evidence
led him to this conclusion or to describe the steps were taken to
stop the leaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't go into it,'' Clark, the supreme allied commander for
Europe, said in an interview this week. ``I have to just say it
apparently happened and we are concerned about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Other NATO officials say that allied pilots suspected Yugoslav
officials were being tipped off because certain targets appeared to
be vacated after they appeared on target lists but before NATO
planes attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said the apparent leaks were detected early in the 78-day
bombing campaign that began on March 24 and were quickly halted.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO bombing was designed to force Yugoslavia to halt its
program of ``ethnic cleansing'' directed against the Albanian
Muslims in Kosovo, a province in Yugoslavia. The United States
provided 720 aircraft and flew 80 percent of the missions; other
NATO members provided 348 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   On April 13, in the middle of the air war, Clark acknowledged
concerns about keeping the target lists secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, NATO remains very vigilant in terms of protecting the
security of its operations,'' Clark told reporters in Brussels,
when asked about alleged security breaches. ``We're taking what I
believe are all necessary and appropriate measures in that
regard,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Those security concerns in part prompted a change in the
procedure used by the allies to select targets.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials initially followed a lengthy target-selection
process inspired by the political necessity of keeping all 19 NATO
nations informed and in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Proposed targets would be approved by the ambassadors from NATO
member states, who at times would seek advice and direction from
their respective capitals. The result was that targeting plans were
widely disseminated. Pentagon officials suspect the leaks to
Belgrade may have occurred in this process.
</P>
<P>
   The air-tasking order _ the daily battlefield plan that assigned
pilots to attack particular targets and helped ensure that allied
planes wouldn't crash into one another in the busy skies over
Kosovo _ often took 72 hours to clear the political hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   Clark later streamlined the target selection process to give
commanders greater freedom to bomb targets without consulting every
NATO country.
</P>
<P>
   Former CIA analyst Glenn Buchan, an expert on air power with
Rand Corp., a policy think tank in Santa Monica, Calif., called the
leaks ``a big deal'' that could have ramifications for NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment there is a lot of effort to figure out how to
operate more effectively in coalitions,'' Buchan said in an
interview Wednesday. ``This might bring that to a screeching halt,
or at least bring it to a crawl, and suggest to the United States
that it might be better to go it alone'' in future conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials checking into the leaks were careful not to point
their fingers at any particular NATO members. However, before the
war, different NATO members had a variety of relationships with
Yugoslavia. For example, Greece, France and Italy have had close
ties to Serbia for years. Greece also is close with Russia, a
staunch ally of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   During the war, Greece and Italy had the strongest domestic
opposition to the NATO bombing, while French officials early in the
war opposed bombing civilian infrastructure targets such as bridges
and the power grid. Eventually, NATO included some of those targets
as the bombing escalated.
</P>
<P>
   Before the bombing campaign began, NATO officials had become
concerned about possible spying when a French military officer was
arrested last year for passing secret NATO battle plans to the head
of the Yugoslav diplomatic mission at the European Union. The
Frenchman, who faces espionage charges in France, has admitted to
handing off the information.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations of leaks to Belgrade cropped up shortly after the
war began. In April, British military leaders ``accused a
treacherous NATO member of leaking details'' of targets to the
Serbs who ran Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting unnamed British Ministry of Defense officials, The Mail,
a London newspaper, reported on April 11 that the leaks included
``advance notice that Royal Air Force ground attack planes would
destroy a particular building in Serbia, giving the Serbs time to
evacuate it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   When a management consultant arrived for his interview with a
Big Five accounting firm, he was appalled to find that all the
bullet points on the resume he had sent by e-mail had morphed into
little pencil symbols when the interviewer printed out the
document. The candidate had to waste the first few minutes of the
meeting explaining that what the hiring manager held in his hand
was the result of some sort of technical glitch, not a lack of
professionalism.
</P>
<P>
   How was this job seeker to know that his carefully worded job
descriptions would go from impressive to infantile with the click
of a Send button? How can any job seeker know what happens to a
resume when it leaves the personal computer nest and ventures into
the increasingly electronic world of hiring?
</P>
<P>
   Many employers now scan, download, upload, keyword-search and
bank resumes they receive, which means that applicants must take
special care to draft documents whose content and format can be
read by all sorts of digital systems. A resume lacking key
industry-specific jargon will not pop up on the screens of hiring
managers when they search for suitable candidates in their
companies' staffing databases. And the formatting flourishes common
in print resumes, like boldfacing, italicizing and centering, can
turn text into gobbledygook when a scanner gets hold of it.
(Scanners and applicant databases thrive on a bland diet of plain,
left-justified text.)
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing that has stayed the same is that many
resumes still get tossed into the proverbial circular file; only
now that file is more likely to be a Recycle Bin icon or an e-mail
delete button.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to keeping up with technological changes, resumes
must keep pace with changes in employment itself. Career changers,
downsized employees and portfolio workers (people with patchwork
careers consisting of various freelance, consulting and contract
assignments) are more the norm these days than are job seekers with
straightforward career histories. The old chronological resume
built around dates of employment and job titles (known in the
career counseling trade as the obituary style) doesn't cut it when
you're trying to streamline a convoluted work history or sell a
prospective employer on your transferable skills and potential.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for a job now, you have to assess your skills
and talents, catalog your accomplishments, anticipate the
employer's needs and choose among a dizzying array of layouts and
fonts that will best showcase what you have to offer. Then, to get
the overall format right, you have to determine whether your resume
will be read digitally in the electronic sense or digitally in the
piece-of-paper-held-in-human-fingers sense.
</P>
<P>
   If all of that sounds like more than you care to handle on your
own, consider using a resume software package to walk you step by
step through the writing and designing processes.

   Resume Maker Deluxe Edition
</P>
<P>
   (Individual Software; $39.95; Windows 95 or later and
Macintosh.)
</P>
<P>
   Resume Maker With Career Planning
</P>
<P>
   (Individual Software; $29.95; Windows 95 or later.)
</P>
<P>
   Resume Maker Deluxe is the Arnold Schwarzenegger of
resume-writing software. It's a blockbuster _ powerful and huge in
size and scope, but gentle and friendly once you get to know it
(``Kindergarten Cop'' Schwarzenegger, not ``Terminator''
Schwarzenegger).
</P>
<P>
   Everything about it is big, from the 100,000 prewritten resume
phrases for more than 12,000 careers to the 3,600-action-word
thesaurus to the 1.5 million-plus job openings it will give you
access to on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   And Resume Maker Deluxe does not merely make resumes. The
software contains hundreds of sample cover and follow-up letters,
as well as tips on interviewing and salary negotiation, and a
contact manager to keep your job search organized.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its complex nature, Resume Maker Deluxe is a snap to
install and easy to use. The screens are uncluttered, with clear
navigation buttons and a logical sequence. The resume layouts are
effective and come in a wide range of styles suitable for managers,
administrative staff, recent graduates and more, and include
several samples of electronically compatible, scannable resumes.
</P>
<P>
   The process of writing a resume is made simple with a
fill-in-the-blank format. The system walks you through each section
of the resume where you fill in the necessary information. If
you're stumped for what to say, sample phrases or action verbs can
pop up on screen to get you past writer's block, and if you want to
make changes in the finished product, it is surprisingly easy to do
so. Once you have completed your resume, this software offers an
easy-to-follow method for e-mailing or faxing it, along with any
cover letters you have developed in the system.
</P>
<P>
   Though ResumeMaker Deluxe offers impressive substance behind the
slick packaging and fancy graphics, it does sacrifice some quality
when it tries to be a virtual career coach. There is nothing wrong
with the interviewing tips provided through mock interviews or with
the job-hunting advice offered through video clips from the
best-selling author Richard Fein. Fein's work is well respected in
the career counseling world, and his suggestions are well aimed.
</P>
<P>
   But when the complex art and science of finding a job is reduced
to advice sound bites, that advice cannot begin to address fully
the subtle nuances of job-hunting strategy. Providing only a few
acceptable answers to tricky interview questions, for example, does
not do justice to the complexity of the dilemma that job seekers
face.
</P>
<P>
   Another disappointment is the ``free bonus'' feature called
Career Planner, which matches your skills and personality with a
list of occupations you might want to pursue and provides
descriptions of the typical job duties and salary ranges for each
field. Though the career field descriptions are useful _ albeit
cursory and frustratingly basic _ the simplistic self-assessment
tool that profiles your abilities and preferences is inadequate and
even misleading. Having you answer just a few questions about what
you do well and like does not begin to paint a complete picture of
who you are and what work you should do.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to write a good resume and job search letters, and
would appreciate the convenience of a built-in contact management
database and interview appointment log, then Resume Maker Deluxe is
more than worth its price. But for help in choosing a career
direction and crafting a job search strategy, you're better off
with a real, live career counselor or job search coach than with
this virtual one.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative to Resume Maker Deluxe is Resume Maker with the
Kaplan Career Counselor feature. You will find an almost identical
resume development guide, contact manager and springboard to
Internet job listings. But in place of the expert advice on a range
of job hunting topics, it offers a comprehensive guide to choosing
a career direction. The questionnaire that links your interests to
career fields has the same flaws as that of the deluxe edition
(rarely can a quickie self-assessment tool take the place of more
formal career and personality testing administered through a
qualified professional), but the detailed information and videos on
12,700 careers are helpful for researching career options and
identifying the job-related skills that should be highlighted in a
resume.

   WINWAY RESUME
</P>
<P>
   (Winway; $39.95; Windows 95 or later.)
</P>
<P>
   The basic features of Winway Resume are almost indistinguishable
from those of the Resume Maker products. The two companies tend to
run neck and neck in the race for a bigger piece of the resume
software market. Winway does offer a couple of features that some
job-seekers might find handy, like envelope-printing when you need
to mail a resume and letter the old-fashioned way, as well as
easy-to-follow guidelines for sending resumes in RTF, ASCII or HTML
format by e-mail or posting on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, the differences between Winway Resume and
Resume Maker are mostly semantic. What Resume Maker calls Guided
Resumes, Winway has registered as Resume Autowriter, and what the
former refers to simply as ``action phrases'' Winway has
trademarked as ``Job-Winning Phrases.'' A notable difference,
however, is in the overall style of the programs. Winway appears
slightly less polished and visually appealing, and its format _
although fairly easy to follow _ doesn't offer the same
hand-holding of the Resume Maker packages.
</P>
<P>
   A notable strength of Winway, however, is its job-search advice.
The company's career expert, Barbara Nixon, dispenses excellent
advice, particularly around the issue of overall job-search
strategy. She warns job seekers to plan on having to spend up to a
month identifying and researching potential employers before
sending out resumes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nixon also reminds users that networking is the most
effective of all job hunting methods _ an especially important
point considering that these all-inclusive resume packages can lull
users into a passive attitude toward job hunting. A job seeker
plugs in some data to create a resume, clicks a few buttons to cast
that resume out into the great gray yonder of Web-based job
postings and then sits back and expects the calls and e-mail to
start pouring in.
</P>
<P>
   Online job hunting may be enormously convenient, but it is a
shot-in-the-dark approach that nevertheless leads job seekers to
believe they will get jobs with no human contact and very little
effort. The job-hunting advice on Winway Resume dispels that myth
and helps you put together a more-than-adequate resume in the
process.

   Ready-To-Go Resumes
</P>
<P>
   (Ten Speed Press; $29.95; 3 diskettes of resume templates for
Microsoft Word for PC)
</P>
<P>
   (WordPerfect PC, and Microsoft Word for Macintosh;
</P>
<P>
   From Ten Speed Press, the folks who bring you the job-hunting
book ``What Color is Your Parachute?'' year after year, comes
another homespun marvel. Ready-To-Go Resumes is an utterly
user-friendly system with simple design and accurate, advice from
the career-coaching trenches. You will not find the bells and
whistles that accompany resume software from the software programs.
In fact, Ready-To-Go Resumes is not actually software. It is a set
of three diskettes containing files of resume templates that you
pull up and type into your own word processing program and type
directly into.
</P>
<P>
   If you can perform the most basic functions on your computer,
you can begin using this system in a matter of seconds. Only two
pages of the 125-page user's manual are operating instructions. The
rest are guidelines for choosing formats and writing your resume,
as well as hard copies of the 28 resume templates on the disks.
</P>
<P>
   The tips on selecting a resume format include what has to be one
of the most effective and concise explanations ever written on the
chronological and functional styles and how to choose between them.
The manual includes resumes used by job hunters, showing how the 28
templates look when names, job descriptions and other data are
added. Ready-To-Go Resumes tacks on two sample cover letter
templates and one template for a thank you note _ not an abundance
of choices, but the samples are well written and sufficient to give
you an idea of how your letters should sound.
</P>
<P>
   Two particularly useful features of Ready-To-Go Resumes are: a
draft resume template (a resume you can show to people while
networking or conducting informational interviews, before you have
a clear job objective); and a resume clinic section of the manual,
offering creative solutions to 14 typical resume-writing problems,
like lack of experience, concerns about age discrimination and gaps
in work history because of child rearing, unemployment, or other
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The only fault I could find with Ready-To-Go Resumes is the
short shrift it gives preparing resumes for electronic transmission
and scanning. The tips are accurate but not comprehensive, although
the author's Web site, www.damngood.com, offers more detailed,
timely guides for preparing e-mailable and scannable resumes.
</P>
<P>
   Ready-To-Go Resumes' low-technology approach will not appeal to
those who want slick packaging, colorful video and audio clips,
links to Internet job listings and other full-service features.
But, for those who want professional advice almost exclusively
about resume writing (and who realize that they can easily access
Internet job listings and general career planning advice from other
sources) Ready-To-Go Resumes is the best _ and the best value _ of
the bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Ready-To-Go Resumes is sold in bookstores, rather than through
software retailers, or can be ordered at www.damngood.com.

 &HT;    Get corny with a sweet, perennial favorite
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest gift the Americas have given to the rest of
the world is corn.
</P>
<P>
   Believed to be descended from a wild grass that once grew in
what is now southern Mexico around 6,000 B.C., this amazing food,
which is part grain and part vegetable, was developed and
hybridized quickly and often by ancient peoples _ the Incas alone
developed some 48 varieties. Its use spread quickly around the
world, where it sustained numerous cultures.
</P>
<P>
   While the indigenous peoples of the Americas revered corn in
ceremony and song, latter-day Americans simply adore it. Freshly
picked corn on the cob, sweet and crunchy and drizzled with butter,
is a notorious scene stealer at any summer table.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes on the Internet can give you an eye-opening look
at the impact this plain and simple food has had on the social,
economic and religious aspects of our world, as well as lots of
ideas on how to enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  To understand that that ear of corn is a tangible link between
ancient and modern American cultures, see ``Art, Songs, Stories and
Poetry about Corn'' at www.agry.purdue.edu/agronomy
</P>
<P>
   /ext/corn/cgg5/art.htm and ``Native American History of Corn''
at www.nativeweb.org/NativeTech/cornhusk/cornhusk.html. There are
also links on how to make authentic Native American corn husk
dolls, bottles and masks.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  At www.samcooks.com/EatFresh/Vegetables/Corn.htm you will
learn that:
</P>
<P>
   It was the early English settlers who decided they didn't care
for the Indian word maize. ``Rather, they adopted the term `Indian
corn' to distinguish it from British corn, which to them meant all
grains, including wheat and barley.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the corn grown, we eat less than 1 percent. The rest goes
into fuels, oils, syrups, powders and a host of other products
amounting to a $20 billion a year industry.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 corn-growing state is not Iowa or Nebraska but
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Learn the astounding list of products that are made from corn,
including printers' ink, at www.ohiocorn.org/.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  One myth about corn that needs correcting is that it has
little nutritional value. Corn is a source of energy-sustaining
complex carbohydrates and is very low in fat. Yellow corn is higher
in vitamin A (carotene) than white corn but both strains are rich
in vitamins B, C and potassium. One ear (which, by the way,
averages 800 kernels arranged in 16 rows) contains about 70
calories. See www.hashouse.com

 &HT;    Chop it, grate it, pulse it _ presto, it's pesto!

<TEXT>
<P>
   Even if you're the kind of person who follows recipes to a T,
allow yourself to experiment and adjust these pestos to your
personal tastes. Do invest in a good hunk of Parmigiano-Reggiano
from Italy and some very green extra-virgin olive oil for your
pesto adventure. Less expensive products, sadly, don't compare.
</P>
<P>
   With some herbs from your garden, fresh nuts and intriguing
additions,

</P>
<P>
   Spoon a little of this over a bowl of fresh fettuccine (or
trenette, as the Genoese refer to this pasta) for a true taste of
the Italian Riviera. Marcella Hazan recommends boiling peeled,
thinly sliced potatoes with the fettuccine. Others add small cubes
of peeled eggplant to the pasta pot.
</P>
<P>
   2 large garlic cloves
</P>
<P>
   2 cups packed fresh basil leaves
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons pine nuts
</P>

   2 tablespoons freshly grated Italian parmesan
(Parmigiano-Reggiano) cheese
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons freshly grated Pecorino cheese
</P>
<P>
   1/3 to 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Using a pestle, pound the garlic in a large mortar. Gradually
add the basil and nuts and continue pounding until the mixture is
well-blended. Pound in the cheeses and then the oil, mixing well.
(Alternately, blend the ingredients in a food processor, reducing
the amount of oil to 1/4 cup and the total grated cheese to 3
tablespoons.) Serving suggestions: Pasta, pizza.

<P>
   Lou Siebert Pappas, who invented this recipe for her nifty

   2 red bell peppers, quartered, cored and seeded

<P>
   2 shallots or green onions (white part only), chopped

<P>
   3 large garlic cloves, smashed
</P>

   1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese or 1 to 2 ounces
goat cheese (about 2 to 4 tablespoons)
</P>
<P>
   Place the peppers, shallots or green onions, almonds and garlic
in a blender or food processor. Whirl until finely minced. Add the
oil and cheese, and process until blended. Transfer to a small
bowl, cover and chill. Serving suggestions: serve in tacos or
quesadillas. Spoon over polenta.

<P>
   Preparation time: 5 minutes
</P>
<P>
   This pesto was the result of tinkering around with leftover
cilantro, but now I buy cilantro just to make it. I like to serve
it as a dip for carrot sticks and chips as well as a table
condiment for grilled vegetables.

   Another happy experiment, and one that uses up green tomatoes in
a novel way. Barilla spaghetti with this sauce and plenty of grated
Parmigiano is a rite of summer at our house. Serve with a (red)
tomato salad.
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons quality olive oil
</P>
<P>
   3 medium cloves garlic, chopped
</P>
<P>
   3 medium (baseball-size) green tomatoes, cut in eighths
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup water
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon dried basil (or 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   Heat oil in a large pot or saucepan over medium-low heat. Add
garlic and stir to cook 1 minute, until softened and aromatic. Add
cut-up tomatoes and increase heat to medium. Saute, stirring
frequently, until garlic barely begins to brown, about 4 minutes.
Add water immediately and cover pot. If using dried basil, add now.
Cook 5-8 minutes longer, checking occasionally, until tomatoes are
soft and liquid in pot is thick and syrupy.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer contents to bowl of food processor or blender and add
cheese. Puree. Transfer to a saucepan or microwavable bowl and
season to taste. Reheat on stovetop or microwave and serve with hot
strand pasta. If using fresh basil, sprinkle on top as a garnish.
</P>
<P>
   Note: This sauce is also excellent for cold pasta salad. Toss
with cooked pasta and chill thoroughly.

   Here's a recipe from Northwestern chef Caprial Pence that
combines pesto with complementary flavors for a satisfying and rich
vegetarian entree.
</P>
<P>
   For the polenta:
</P>
<P>
   6 cups vegetable stock
</P>
<P>
   4 cloves garlic, chopped
</P>
<P>
   3 shallots, chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons Tabasco or less to taste
</P>
<P>
   3 cups finely ground cornmeal
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   For the pesto:
</P>
<P>
   3 cups fresh basil leaves
</P>
<P>
   4 cloves garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 cup pine nuts or walnuts, toasted
</P>
<P>
   1 cup freshly grated Parmesan
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   To assemble:
</P>
<P>
   2 cups ricotta cheese
</P>
<P>
   2 cups blue cheese
</P>
<P>
   1 cup freshly grated Parmesan
</P>
<P>
   For the polenta: Butter a 9-by-11-inch baking pan. Heat the
stock, garlic, shallots and Tabasco in a medium saucepan until it
reaches a rolling boil. While whisking, slowly add the cornmeal in
a thin stream. Cook over medium heat, stirring until very thick,
about 5 minutes. Add the butter and season with salt and pepper.
Pour into the prepared pan and set aside to cool.
</P>
<P>
   For the pesto: Put the basil, garlic, nuts and Parmesan in the
bowl of a food processor and process until the mixture is smooth.
Scrape down the sides of the bowl and, with the machine running,
slowly add the olive oil through the feeder tube. Puree until
smooth. Transfer the pesto to a bowl and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   To assemble: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Run the blade of a
knife around the edge of the polenta and loosen it from the pan.
Gently invert the pan and remove the cooled polenta. With a
long-bladed, sharp knife, cut the polenta horizontally into two
equal sheets. Place one layer of the polenta in the baking pan.
Spread half of the pesto on the polenta. Spread about half of the
ricotta on top of the pesto. Sprinkle half of the blue cheese and
Parmesan cheese over the ricotta. Place the other half of the
polenta on top of the cheese. Cover with the remaining cheese. Bake
in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and
hot. Remove the lasagne from the oven and let cool for 3 to 4
minutes. Cut into portions; transfer to individual plates and
serve.

 &HT;    Go ahead, experiment! Work your own magic with pesto, a simple
tradition
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If ever there was a recipe that wants to be played with, it's
pesto. So easy to assemble and to tinker with, such a good use for
an overly fertile herb garden, such a refreshing taste of summer
whatever the weather, homemade pesto is welcome in all its guises.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we're talking American pesto. Ask anyone in Genoa,
the Italian port city famous for inventing pesto, and you will
learn there is one method, one recipe. Pound garlic in a mortar and
gradually add basil, pine nuts, dry-aged cheese and, finally, olive
oil in the thinnest of streams. If the pesto maker is not felled by
carpal tunnel syndrome first, a glossy and vivid sauce results.
</P>
<P>
   Here we don't have much time to spare, and we've never met a
culinary tradition we couldn't turn on its ear. We dump the
ingredients into a food processor and _ zip, zip _ wonderful pasta
sauce appears in a matter of seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Even tradition-bound cookbook author Marcella Hazan admitted in
``The Classic Italian Cookbook,'' her benchmark 1973 work, that she
makes pesto in a blender. ``Pesto is such an inspired invention,''
she writes, ``that it survives almost anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But could she have predicted just how fast and how loose
Americans would play with the rules? Not content with the same old
basil, we raid the herb garden for pesto innovations _ cilantro,
dill, lemon grass _ and think nothing of throwing in a few roasted
chile peppers or green tomatoes. We don't merely ladle pesto over
fresh pasta, but stuff it under chicken skin, smear it on burger
buns and swirl it into soups. Here in America, pesto rules.
</P>
<P>
   ( PESTO POINTERS )
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Not all herbs want to be used in abundance. Pungent choices
like tarragon, rosemary and sage should be used sparingly in a
pesto that relies on a relatively mild herb (basil, parsley or
cilantro) for body.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Pecans and almonds make economical substitutions for pine nuts
in pesto recipes, but walnuts sometimes have such tannic,
astringent skins that we recommend looking for others first. And
beware those nuts that hang in crinkly little plastic packages in
the supermarkets: they are often old and rancid.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If you can get your hands on some pecorino (hard sheep's milk
cheese), it will offset the mellow, nutty Parmesan with an
engagingly sharp bite.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Store the pesto in a jar and drizzle a little olive oil over
the top to keep the surface from discoloring.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Remember to beat a spoonful of hot water from the pasta pot
into the pesto before serving; this keeps it from separating and
helps it to better coat the noodles.

 &HT;    Buttermilk stirs many memories
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Asheley Carpenter's request for an old-fashioned
buttermilk pie prompted 34 readers to dig in their files for their
mother's or grandmother's favorite or through old cookbooks to a
time when buttermilk was more flavorful and fashionable than it is
today.
</P>
<P>
   This recipe comes from Nancy S. Wanko of Dunwoody(Ga.), who said
it's been in her family for generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always the favorite dessert of my mother's mother and
has proven to be very popular for the dinner-on-the-grounds my
family always has on Decoration Day. I hope this is what your
reader was looking for and will bring back many happy memories of
family reunions gone by,'' Wanko wrote.
</P>
<P>
   We hope so, too.

CLOWN ALLEYS DOT THE INFORMATION HIGHWAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's summer: time to run away and be a clown. Or perhaps rent
one, or pick up a few styling tips and a nose job? Step right up to
the Internet and its clown alleys, the traditional name for the
section off the midway that housed the clowns' dressing quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Ringling Brothers and Barnum &AMP; Bailey Circus has its own Web
site, www.ringling.com, with an online Clown Alley for each of
Ringling Brothers' two touring units. Between the lines of the
clowns' capsule biographies there lurks an intensity of feeling
that suggests that some of these people have clown blood.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Wheaton's biography, for instance, notes that his
great-grandparents were both Ringling Brothers performers: ``his
great-grandfather was an albino, billed as `the Wild Man From
Borneo,' while his great-grandmother was an acrobat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ringling Brothers pages are glitzy show biz. For a grittier
look at clown life, a site by John Decker displays evocative
pictures of the former clown tent at Clyde Beatty-Cole Brothers
Circus (www.intac.com/jdeck/clownalley/Cl.html). Inside the tent,
photos show the clowns applying makeup, choosing costumes, lining
up at the chow wagon and practicing their juggling as they wait for
their cues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old-fashioned clown alley ended after the 1997 season,''
said Renee Storey, the circus' vice president for administration.
The Clyde Beatty-Cole Brothers clowns now use a trailer and
recreational vehicles, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-year-old International Clown Hall of Fame and Research
Center in Milwaukee (webdom.com/chof) is a major resource for
students of the various styles of clowning and clowns of the past,
including Roman and medieval forebears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the queries I receive pertain to clown history,''
Kathryn O'Dell, the center's executive director, wrote by e-mail.
``Many folks who contact me had a family member who was a clown and
write me for assistance as they search their genealogy.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1989 through 1998, 41 clowns have been inducted into the
Hall of Fame. Its Web site includes posters of each year's
inductees, as well as close-ups and biographies. Red Skelton and
Emmett Kelly Sr. are among the charter members.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Keeshan, television's first Clarabelle and later its Captain
Kangaroo, is there. So are Oleg Popov, the Russian clown; Max
Patkin, the ``Clown Prince of Baseball''; a number of television
Bozos and many Ringling, Shrine Circus and foreign greats.
</P>
<P>
   There is a Clown Web Ring, www.cswnet.com/imaclown/ring.html,
with 161 sites for individual clowns and organizations, chat rooms
and tips on balloon tying, juggling and magic.
</P>
<P>
   A driving force among many clowns is religion, as a sample of
site names on the Web ring makes clear: A Place for the Christian
Clown, Powerhouse Youth Ministries With Brother BoBo, the
Joybringers Web Pages, Clowns 4 Jesus and O.B. Joyfull.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clowns in general are very giving, caring people,'' said
Geoffrey L. (Hickory) Turner of Latham, N.Y., a computer programmer
and consultant who founded Hickory's Clown Alley
(www.webclowns.com/infolinks.htm). ``Many of them are involved in
their church and, in their children's programs at church,
incorporate their clown into that ministry. Also, there is a need
to deliver the gospel in a new and fresh way _ clowning is one of
those ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner, 46, said via e-mail that he became interested in
clowning in 1991 after watching a worship service led by a clown
troupe, the Joyful Joeys. ``I was `Boss Clown' for six years,
touring throughout New Jersey and New York, leading our unique
brand of worship,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He started Hickory's Clown Alley in 1997, and it now receives
2,500 visits a month, along with e-mail from around the world, a
sort of clown cultural exchange. Turner said he adds about 15
clowns a month to his mailing list.
</P>
<P>
   Three types of clowning in particular are attracting new
performers, Turner wrote, starting with church clowning. ``In the
early years of America, clowns would get on the stage and mime the
scripture readings for those in the back who couldn't hear,'' he
said. ``This died away in the late 1800s but is now experiencing a
well-received revival.''
</P>
<P>
   Another popular specialty is hospital clowning: ``Patch Adams is
alive and well,'' Turner wrote. And recently, he added, there has
been a flurry of activity in clowning for the deaf, through sign
language and standard mime techniques.

 &HT;    Blithe Blige a crying shame
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The disappointing thing about this album is about as easy to
discern as the difference between ``Not Gon' Cry'' and ``Not Going
to Cry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not Gon' Cry'' is the single from the ``Waiting to Exhale''
soundtrack that Mary J. Blige breathed blood, sweat and tears into
in 1995. The betrayed-wife tale told in broken English was perfect
for this unfettered ``queen of hip-hop/soul,'' because few
vocalists can convey wrenching ache so beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not Going to Cry'' is probably what that single would have
been called if it was on this fourth CD. That is, if it had made
the cut against all the shiny, happy material on ``Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   It's almost sad to say, but Blige's voice is best appreciated
mired in pain. This album, however, is mostly highly polished glee
(``Beautiful One,'' ``I'm in Love'') that she doesn't really sink
her grit into. It starts to happen when Aretha Franklin joins her
on ``Don't Waste Your Time,'' followed by the first single with
real vocal and musical feeling, ``The Love I Never Had.'' But it's
not long before the production equivalent of Pledge settles again,
stifling Blige's earnest vocal effort at a First Choice remake and
a powerful album closer, ``Let No Man Put Asunder.''
</P>

 &HT;    Putting brews to the taste test
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Derek Reever rolled it around in his mouth, swallowed
and said with assurance, ``That's Budweiser. I know it.''
</P>
<P>
   A blind tasting tests the palate as much as it tests the beer.
We want to think we know what we like, and would know it anywhere,
anytime.
</P>
<P>
   Across the table, Jay Young held his glass against the light and
demurred. ``No, I can guarantee you it's not Budweiser. It has too
much color to be Bud.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a sampling of mass-market American lagers, six in all
plus a wild card. One was the King of Beers, another has been
living most of the century off a blue ribbon it won in 1893.
Several were corner-tavern beers, the beers our fathers and
grandfathers drank. That's as far as sentimentality should carry
us. The aim was to see which of these beers _ the kind most
Americans drink _ would come out on top when impartial citizens
were judging the beer and not identifying with a label.
</P>
<P>
   The results might surprise you.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the jury consisted of Reever, a 30-year-old
computer hardware salesman; Young, 30, an accountant; Michelle
Maddox, 26, a customer service agent for Delta; and Rahim
Ghassemian, 46, a computer sales manager. All were experienced and
knowledgeable quaffers, with nothing against lowbrow lagers.
</P>
<P>
   Every jury needs a foreman, and I undertook that thankless duty
as best I could. We were impaneled at Taco Mac in metro Atlanta on
a Sunday afternoon, pens and note paper before us. Kevin Southern,
manager of the place, cleverly scrambled the list I'd given him and
Jeff Hussain served the 3-ounce sampler glasses every 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The list?
</P>
<P>
   In alphabetical order, it consisted of Budweiser, Coors, Iron
City, Miller Genuine Draft, Pabst Blue Ribbon and Rolling Rock. Oh
yes, and that wild card. More about that shortly.
</P>
<P>
   In a blind tasting of this kind, certain beers have standing
invitations, and one of those is Bud. It might not want one, but it
gets one anyway. Years ago, you'd have insisted that Schlitz be
there as well, but the Beer that Made Milwaukee Famous can hardly
be found anymore. You'd have wanted Falstaff and perhaps Stag or
Blatz.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on where you grew up, there would be dozens of other
entrants: Old Style, Weidemann's, Grain Belt, Hamm's, Dixie, Pearl,
Olympia. ...
</P>
<P>
   Most were regional beers, relics today of an overromanticized
past. In their place one might have substituted Icehouse, Stroh's,
Busch, Michelob or any number of low-cal beers. But it seemed
logical to eliminate the light beers and _ for this tasting at
least _ to restrict the entries to one per brewery. Hence,
Budweiser but not also Michelob or Busch, Miller Genuine Draft but
not also Miller High Life.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring was simple: one point for a beer a juror didn't like;
two for a beer he thought drinkable but probably wouldn't buy;
three for a beer he thought pretty good and might consider buying;
four for a beer that might have moved him to say, ``Now, that's my
kind of beer.''
</P>
<P>
   As the jury carefully sipped and weighed the evidence, judgments
like the following were written:
</P>
<P>
   ``Watery, no personality, no body.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did not have a taste, good or bad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is No. 1 all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, jurors were surprised by a sameness from one
beer to another. ``I think they're trying to trick us,'' Reever
said as Hussain brought another sample. ``They're just pouring the
same beer every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for No. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone recognized immediately that it was different from the
first three, and at the end all agreed that it stood above the
others. Yet it was a lager brewed in the pilsener style, the same
as the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an American microbeer,'' Young said. ``This is not a
mainstream beer.''
</P>
<P>
   But what was it?
</P>
<P>
   First the also-rans, beginning from the bottom. (Close your eyes
and make your own guesses.)
</P>
<P>
   Seventh, with five points (every juror giving it only point ),
was Miller Genuine Draft.
</P>
<P>
   Sixth, with eight points: Coors.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth, with 9.5 points: Rolling Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth, with 11.5 points: Iron City, little advertised and
little respected outside blue-collar precincts of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Third, only a hair better at 12 points: Budweiser, the most
heavily advertised beer in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Second, and an appreciable notch higher than the King of Beers
at 15 points: Pabst Blue Ribbon, as working-class as a beer can
get.
</P>
<P>
   But first, with 16.5 points, a beer that three jurors awarded
with 4s ... Laughing Skull Bohemian Pilsner, made by Atlanta
Brewing Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smooth. Rich flavor,'' Michelle Maddox wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hoppy, good color &AMP; flavor, very tasty,'' wrote Young.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy the label, but you drink the beer. Sometimes you
have to hide the label to realize it.
</P>
<P>
   PICK OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   You don't look to Belgium for summer seasonal ales. The Belgians
produce the most idiosyncratic beers in the world, with yeasts that
impart fruity, estery flavor notes that the uninitiated sometimes
need time to get used to. What a surprise, then, to come upon La
Chouffe Biere du Soleil, produced by Brasserie D'Achouffe.
</P>
<P>
   This is not your typical summer beer, lemony or citrusy, trying
to disguise the fact that it's a beer. But neither is it heavy in
the way a Scottish ale or certain stouts can be. Drunk as an
aperitif, it whets the appetite; drunk with a meal, it brings
flavors alive.
</P>
<P>
   La Chouffe Biere du Soleil is a Belgian ale in every sense,
clean and soft but with a maltiness that is firm without being
cloying or rich. Poured into a tumbler, it rises to a creamy crown
atop an amber, almost orangey, liquid. The hoppiness is subtle, and
only a person who doesn't like beer would call it ``bitter.''
</P>
<P>
   La Chouffe is a farmhouse brewery in the Ardennes region, north
of Bastogne. It was in this region that the Battle of the Bulge was
fought more than half a century ago. Drinking this delightful beer
from its 750 milliliter bottle (about $8 at most stores), I had the
fondest recollection of a vacation to Germany and Belgium a few
years ago and of the utterly distinctive way in which people in
those small towns create their meals and complement them with beers
that are superlative in any season.

   ``I've Got a Right to Cry''
</P>
<P>
   Mandy Barnett. Sire. 12 tracks. Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Popping this CD into the stereo is like hopping into the
professor's DeLorean in ``Back to the Future'' and setting the dial
to ``Nashville, 1962.'' Barnett and legendary producer Owen Bradley
(Patsy Cline, Brenda Lee) and his brother, guitarist Harold
Bradley, have almost perfectly re-created the mood of country's
golden days. Young Barnett sounds exactly like Cline, which is not
surprising since she got her start four years ago portraying the
country singer at the Ryman Auditorium. Though some might criticize
Barnett for not treading outside Cline country to establish her own
style, she's so great at invoking the ghostly voice that it's hard
to dismiss her as simply a copycat. Perhaps channeler is a better
word.

   Robyn Hitchcock. Warner Bros. 12 tracks. Grade: C

<P>
   It's a shame when the semi-great slip into pointlessness. Robyn
Hitchcock made some influential music in the '80s as the leader of
the Soft Boys _ 1980's ``Underwater Moonlight'' still sounds great
today. His solo career scaled some formidable heights, too, but,
for the most part, his brand of warped whimsy and folky psychedelia
doesn't have the punch it once did. Many of the songs here sound
painfully forced. Hitchcock can come across a bit self-conscious,
and he's at his best when he isn't reaching. ``Sally Was a
Legend,'' ``Elizabeth Jade'' and the marvelous title track have
some of the old spark, but you expect more from the man who penned
such extraordinary rock 'n' roll moments as ``Raymond Chandler
Evening'' and ``Kingdom of Love.''

 &HT;    Vocalist adds lush layer to Cuban sound
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though the sudden appearance _ and subsequent stardom _ of a
fraternity of super-annuated masters of Cuban traditional song
forms is phenomenal, it's a no-brainer why American are such
suckers for this stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The artists who perform under the rubric Buena Vista Social Club
uphold musical and emotional values that have slipped or been
stripped away from mainstream pop in the 1990s. Yet, while these
unknown legends represent an old school that predates Sinatra,
they're neither self-consciously retro _ like so many jazz-pop
vocal stylists _ nor overbearingly hip. Vocalist Ibrahim Ferrer,
like his colleagues featured on this debut disc, is the real thing:
Producer Ry Cooder calls him a Cuban Nat ``King'' Cole.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of Afro-Caribbean rhythms, sad-sweet strings, a
vibrant horn section and the vivid guitars of Cooder, Eliades Ochoa
and Manuel Galban make this album a seductive treat even without
Ferrer's sublime Spanish-language crooning. But when Ferrer eases
up to the microphone _ as documented in the recent film ``Buena
Vista Social Club'' _ he becomes the alchemical element that
transforms everything into poetry. Hearing him sing of a heavy
heart, and how he must hide its bitter pain from the beautiful
flowers outside his window, is so unabashedly romantic it can't be
denied. Ferrer is so delicately nuanced and deeply experienced that
he pulls it off without ever seeming grandiose or corny.

 &HT;    MILLENNIUM'S LAST SOLAR ECLIPSE PROVES AN EXCITING TEASE
 &HT;    675&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    Moving both (i) International and (l) Lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FALMOUTH, England _ The moon ruled the sun briefly Wednesday
creating a haunting and memorable herald of the new era seen by
millions across Europe and western Asia.
</P>
<P>
   People across the 4,500-mile band of moon shadow that began in
the north Atlantic Ocean near Canada and ended in the Bay Bengal
off India paused from their routines to view what for most is a
once-in-a-lifetime experience _ a total solar eclipse.
</P>
<P>
   In Isfahan, Iran, the city where scientists believe people had
the best view, spiritual leaders offered special prayer and crowds
broke into whistles, applause and shouts when the moon blotted out
the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds obscured the view in many places, but it didn't seem to
spoil what had become a near-religious observance for some.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts even suggested that the overcast skies added a
fresh dimension to the phenomenon. Patrick Moore, who has seen
seven total eclipses and has written a book about them, said the
cloud cover over Cornwall, England added an eerie feeling to an
already powerful event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a weird experience, unlike anything I've experienced
before,'' Moore said. ``It was amazingly dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there are at least two solar eclipses a year, most are
partial. The next total solar eclipse will be in 2001 over southern
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere was Wednesday's solar spectacle anticipated more than it
was here in Falmouth, a charming old port city in the remote
English county of Cornwall -- at the southwest tip of England.
</P>
<P>
   For days, people here have been fretting over the weather, which
had promised to spoil the heavily promoted event that people here
had come to describe as their Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after a bright orange sunrise, the sky rapidly turned
drab.
</P>
<P>
   Although the crowds began to arrive Tuesday night, many people
stayed away because of predictions of bad weather and dense
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Jenkins and his girlfriend arrived about midnight from
Croydon, just outside London, and expressed amazement that the
traffic was so light. ``I probably averaged 100 miles per hour the
whole way,'' Jenkins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, one thing you can say about the Brits is if someone
tells us to stay home, we do,'' Jenkins said, after securing the
last vacant room in the Greenbank Hotel. ``A lot of people will
just stay in and watch it on telly.''
</P>
<P>
   As the crowds _ at once feared and desired mightily _ did not
materialize, many of the concerts, festivals and other events
organized for the eclipse were canceled. For many, things had
become downright gloomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm going to have to learn some recipes using unsold
T-shirts and postcards or starve,'' said Trevor Pockett, who hawked
from a stand in Falmouth. ``Sales have been just awful, and I've
gone broke.''
</P>
<P>
   Such was the mood Wednesday morning as the moon finally was
scheduled to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, an optimistic gathering of more than 2,000 people climbed
a steep hill to Pendennis Castle, the stony hilltop fortification
commissioned by King Henry VIII.
</P>
<P>
   They were not disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Within five minutes they experienced nightfall and daybreak.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:11 a.m. (6:11 a.m. Eastern Time) the broad bowl of the
ancient harbor here fell nearly dark, looking like some giant
stadium lit only by the flashes of a thousand cameras.
</P>
<P>
   As the moon passed in front of the sun, the chilly drizzle off
the Atlantic paused. The sea birds fell silent, giving way to the
lonely drone of a helicopter overhead. In a town across the way,
orange streetlights tried to flicker to life, while twinkling
lights came on aboard the vessels assembled on the water below. The
gloom was broken by the brief and reassuring sparkle and boom of
fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   This short time in the Path of Totality _ just over two minutes
_ seemed to cast a spell over many of the hundreds gathered at the
castle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit like the end of the world, isn't it?'' said Ann
Mitchell from Manchester as she scanned the darkened harbor from a
grassy mound behind the castle rampart. ``I can feel my heart
beating in my throat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ooo! It's ecstasy.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   For others, the celestial herald of the passage from one
millennium to the next wasn't all it was supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Privett, who had traveled 400 miles from the Midlands,
expressed deep disappointment a few minutes before the eclipse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've waited for this for 45 years,'' said Privett, 66, sipping
indifferently at a plastic cup of red wine. He and his fellow
residents of the Camelot Guest House here in Falmouth had set up on
the castle green with their kelly green and white-striped lawn
chairs, wine and food. ``But I don't think I will see a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Dejected, he glowered at the thick gray clouds that had drifted
over Falmouth, the supposed center of the Path of Totality _ the
62-mile wide band of the moon's shadow across the earth. It was the
first total solar eclipse to come to Britain in 72 years.
</P>
<P>
   Half an hour before the eclipse, a man dressed in Tudor clothes
began leading cheers of ``Clear Skies! Clear Skies!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on,'' he shouted. ``You've got to be heard 68 million
miles away!''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, their voices did not travel far enough.
</P>
<P>
   At the appointed time, the darkness began slowly. When the false
night descended, babies in the castle crowd cried in fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God, oh my God,'' uttered a woman who also seemed
frightened. A few people tried to whip up nervous-sounding cheers,
but none were sustained by the people who seemed to be holding
their breath.
</P>
<P>
   As daylight returned, the crowd applauded with obvious relief.
</P>
<P>
   It was moving, but it still wasn't all it could have been,
Privett said a few minutes after the light returned. ``I didn't get
to see the total eclipse as I expected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Just then, Yvonne Pavitt, also a guest at the Camelot, patted
him excitedly on the shoulder and pointed up. ``Look! Look!''
</P>
<P>
   Through a small break in the clouds was the black disk, edged by
bright silver _ the merged sun and moon. ``How dare you!'' Pavitt
shouted, waving a fist. ``After teasing us so. How dare you!''
</P>
<P>
   ``So, there it is,'' said Privett, looking up with a squint.
``So, there it is.''

   &QR;  ``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'' (R) _ Smokin'. This
whip-smart lark from Great Britain is a caper comedy that glistens
with confidence and a wicked sense of humor. Four likable _ albeit
somewhat conniving _ East End lads have a week to settle the debt
they owe a hood named Hatchet Harry. Rookie writer-
</P>
<P>
   director Guy Ritchie piles on the characters, plot twists and
violence, but one thing is clear: Everyone involved had a fine time
making this movie. You'll have a fine time watching it. Grade: A-

   &QR;  ``The Corruptor'' (R) _ Chow Yun-Fat and Mark Wahlberg play
Chinatown cops forging an uneasy truce in this violent, densely

closest thing yet to Chow's Hong Kong collaborations with John Woo.

</P>
<P>
   anced, now-deceased wife kidnapped him years ago? Well, in this
movie you become Michelle Pfeiffer and self-absorb your way to
family bliss. They should post a warning: The deep end of this
ocean is filled with melodrama. Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   _Jill Vejnoska
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Celebrity'' (R) _ Fame is the name of the game in this Woody
Allen film, but the game is all too familiar. Kenneth Branagh
(doing an uncanny Woody impersonation) and Judy Davis (doing her
version of Woody) are ex-spouses making their way through the
celeb-filled worlds of supermodels, TV talk shows, book signings at
Elaine's. Aside from some amusing observations, the movie feels
stale and strung together. Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Mod Squad'' (R) _ It's the look that matters. Not the
plot involving drugs, murder, good-guys-turned bad and a car wash.
No, what goes on in this movie is thinner than Peggy Lipton's hair.
This ``Mod Squad'' _ with Claire Danes, Omar Epps and Giovanni
Ribisi _ is a fashion layout for Details magazine. All image. All
blurry visuals. All reds and blacks. All jazz riffs and retro TV
music with plenty of bongo drums and brass. Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   _Bob Longino
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``True Crime'' (R) _ Producer-director-star Clint Eastwood
plays a hard-boiled newspaper reporter trying to prove a death-row

self-parody. Grade: D

 &HT;    MILLENNIUM'S LAST SOLAR ECLIPSE PROVES AN EXCITING TEASE

   FALMOUTH, England _ The moon ruled the sun briefly Wednesday
creating a haunting and memorable herald of the new era seen by
millions across Europe and western Asia.
</P>
<P>
   People across the 4,500-mile band of moon shadow that began in
the north Atlantic Ocean near Canada and ended in the Bay Bengal
off India paused from their routines to view what for most is a
once-in-a-lifetime experience _ a total solar eclipse.
</P>
<P>
   In Isfahan, Iran, the city where scientists believe people had
the best view, spiritual leaders offered special prayer and crowds
broke into whistles, applause and shouts when the moon blotted out
the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds obscured the view in many places, but it didn't seem to
spoil what had become a near-religious observance for some.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts even suggested that the overcast skies added a
fresh dimension to the phenomenon. Patrick Moore, who has seen
seven total eclipses and has written a book about them, said the
cloud cover over Cornwall, England added an eerie feeling to an
already powerful event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a weird experience, unlike anything I've experienced
before,'' Moore said. ``It was amazingly dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there are at least two solar eclipses a year, most are
partial. The next total solar eclipse will be in 2001 over southern
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere was Wednesday's solar spectacle anticipated more than it
was here in Falmouth, a charming old port city in the remote
English county of Cornwall -- at the southwest tip of England.
</P>
<P>
   For days, people here have been fretting over the weather, which
had promised to spoil the heavily promoted event that people here
had come to describe as their Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after a bright orange sunrise, the sky rapidly turned
drab.
</P>
<P>
   Although the crowds began to arrive Tuesday night, many people
stayed away because of predictions of bad weather and dense
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Jenkins and his girlfriend arrived about midnight from
Croydon, just outside London, and expressed amazement that the
traffic was so light. ``I probably averaged 100 miles per hour the
whole way,'' Jenkins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, one thing you can say about the Brits is if someone
tells us to stay home, we do,'' Jenkins said, after securing the
last vacant room in the Greenbank Hotel. ``A lot of people will
just stay in and watch it on telly.''
</P>
<P>
   As the crowds _ at once feared and desired mightily _ did not
materialize, many of the concerts, festivals and other events
organized for the eclipse were canceled. For many, things had
become downright gloomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm going to have to learn some recipes using unsold
T-shirts and postcards or starve,'' said Trevor Pockett, who hawked
from a stand in Falmouth. ``Sales have been just awful, and I've
gone broke.''
</P>
<P>
   Such was the mood Wednesday morning as the moon finally was
scheduled to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, an optimistic gathering of more than 2,000 people climbed
a steep hill to Pendennis Castle, the stony hilltop fortification
commissioned by King Henry VIII.
</P>
<P>
   They were not disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Within five minutes they experienced nightfall and daybreak.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:11 a.m. (6:11 a.m. Eastern Time) the broad bowl of the
ancient harbor here fell nearly dark, looking like some giant
stadium lit only by the flashes of a thousand cameras.
</P>
<P>
   As the moon passed in front of the sun, the chilly drizzle off
the Atlantic paused. The sea birds fell silent, giving way to the
lonely drone of a helicopter overhead. In a town across the way,
orange streetlights tried to flicker to life, while twinkling
lights came on aboard the vessels assembled on the water below. The
gloom was broken by the brief and reassuring sparkle and boom of
fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   This short time in the Path of Totality _ just over two minutes
_ seemed to cast a spell over many of the hundreds gathered at the
castle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit like the end of the world, isn't it?'' said Ann
Mitchell from Manchester as she scanned the darkened harbor from a
grassy mound behind the castle rampart. ``I can feel my heart
beating in my throat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ooo! It's ecstasy.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   For others, the celestial herald of the passage from one
millennium to the next wasn't all it was supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Privett, who had traveled 400 miles from the Midlands,
expressed deep disappointment a few minutes before the eclipse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've waited for this for 45 years,'' said Privett, 66, sipping
indifferently at a plastic cup of red wine. He and his fellow
residents of the Camelot Guest House here in Falmouth had set up on
the castle green with their kelly green and white-striped lawn
chairs, wine and food. ``But I don't think I will see a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Dejected, he glowered at the thick gray clouds that had drifted
over Falmouth, the supposed center of the Path of Totality _ the
62-mile wide band of the moon's shadow across the earth. It was the
first total solar eclipse to come to Britain in 72 years.
</P>
<P>
   Half an hour before the eclipse, a man dressed in Tudor clothes
began leading cheers of ``Clear Skies! Clear Skies!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on,'' he shouted. ``You've got to be heard 68 million
miles away!''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, their voices did not travel far enough.
</P>
<P>
   At the appointed time, the darkness began slowly. When the false
night descended, babies in the castle crowd cried in fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God, oh my God,'' uttered a woman who also seemed
frightened. A few people tried to whip up nervous-sounding cheers,
but none were sustained by the people who seemed to be holding
their breath.
</P>
<P>
   As daylight returned, the crowd applauded with obvious relief.
</P>
<P>
   It was moving, but it still wasn't all it could have been,
Privett said a few minutes after the light returned. ``I didn't get
to see the total eclipse as I expected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Just then, Yvonne Pavitt, also a guest at the Camelot, patted
him excitedly on the shoulder and pointed up. ``Look! Look!''
</P>
<P>
   Through a small break in the clouds was the black disk, edged by
bright silver _ the merged sun and moon. ``How dare you!'' Pavitt
shouted, waving a fist. ``After teasing us so. How dare you!''
</P>
<P>
   ``So, there it is,'' said Privett, looking up with a squint.
``So, there it is.''

 &HT;    Witchy women cast their cinematic spell
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With summer movie audiences utterly bewitched and definitely
bothered by the sleeper hit, ``The Blair Witch Project,'' we've
decided that broomsticks aren't just for Halloween anymore. Here
are a few rental ideas presenting a wide range of witchy women:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Witches'' (1989; rated PG) _ Based on Roald Dahl's story
of a little boy who takes on the Grand High Witch of England
(Anjelica Huston), this is not quite a kids' movie and not quite
not a kids' movie. Huston, who does a sort of more frightening
version of her Morticia in the ``Addams Family'' movies, plans to
turn all England's children into mice _ and we're not talking
Mouseketeers. A gleefully fractured fairy tale with a few genuinely
scary moments.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Witches of Eastwick'' (1987; rated R) _ As the devil
incarnate, Jack Nicholson shamelessly overdoes his
cat-who-swallowed-the-cream bit. But his three co-stars _ Susan
Sarandon, Cher and Michelle Pfeiffer _ are truly spell-binding as
three delectable divorcees who end up giving the devil his due.
They make this uneven adaptation of John Updike's novel into more
than just a high-concept witch's brew.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Bell, Book and Candle'' (1958; unrated) _ Poor Jimmy Stewart
doesn't stand a chance when witch Kim Novak decides he's the man
for her, even if he is a mere mortal (right, he's the original
Darren.) Elsa Lanchester and Hermione Gingold have juicy parts as
rival witches from the old school, while Jack Lemmon is a beatnik
warlock. Ironically, the one really caught in Novak's spell was
director Richard Quine; the two had an affair during filming.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``I Married a Witch'' (1942; unrated) _ Veronica Lake _ she's
the slinky blonde with the peek-a-boo hairdo that Kim Basinger was
supposed to look like in ``L.A. Confidential'' _ plays a
reincarnated witch who plagues politician Fredric March because it
was his ancestors who burned her at the stake all those centuries
ago. The director, Rene Clair, initially didn't want Lake in the
movie because he felt she lacked comic talent. But the picture's
producer (and Lake's good friend), Preston Sturges, reminded Clair
of a little film she'd done for him called ``Sullivan's Travels.''
She got the role.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Conqueror Worm'' (1968; unrated) _ Vincent Price stars
as Matthew Hopkins, a real-life ``witch finder'' in 17th-century
England. During the turmoil of the civil wars, he practiced all
sorts of barbarities and torture as he carried out his job. When
the movie was released in the late '60s, critics who expected more
Roger Corman-style camp from Price were shocked by the movie's bold
embrace of gore and horror. It has since become something of a cult
item (adding to the mystique, the 23-year-old director, Michael
Reeves, committed suicide shortly after the picture was released.)
Also known by its British title, ``Witchfinder General.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Crucible'' (1996; rated PG-13) _ It took 40 years for
Arthur Miller's classic play about the Salem, Mass., witch trials
to make it to the screen, but it was worth the wait. Daniel
Day-Lewis and Joan Allen are the husband and wife caught in the
chaos that ensues when Winona Ryder and some of her teenage friends
cry ``witch'' and start pointing fingers. Miller also meant his
play to be a parable for the '50s witch hunts being conducted by
Sen. Joe McCarthy, but you don't need a crash-course in
Blacklisting 101 to appreciate the movie's compelling themes of
prejudiced-fueled hysteria and politically motivated power plays.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Burn, Witch, Burn!'' (1962; unrated) _ A university
professor slowly discovers that his wife is using witchcraft to
further his academic career. Based on the book ``Conjure Wife,''
the movie has been described as a mix of ``Who's Afraid of Virginia
Woolf?'' and ``Rosemary's Baby.'' Speaking of which ...
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Rosemary's Baby'' (1968; rated R) _ Who can forget what
happens to that nice Manhattan couple, Mia Farrow and John
Cassavetes, when they move next door to dear, helpful _ if a little
ditzy _ Ruth Gordon and her coven (I mean, circle) of friends.
Casting note: A then-unknown Jack Nicholson read for the Cassavetes
part, but director Roman Polanski rejected him because of his
``faintly rakish and sinister appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Wizard of Oz'' (1939; rated G) _ Margaret Hamilton and
Billie Burke. Need we say more?
</P>

 &HT;    Much ado about `Shakespeare in Love'
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   What's not to love about this movie?
</P>
<P>
   The best picture winner at this year's Oscars is funny, witty,
fast-paced, smartly acted and maybe the century's second best date
movie. (You must remember ``Casablanca.'')
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Fiennes plays the love-struck Will Shakespeare,
struggling to pen his new play ``Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's
Daughter.'' He's pining for Viola, expertly portrayed by Oscar
winner Gwyneth Paltrow.
</P>
<P>
   The best scene: the on-stage, off-stage couplings interweaving
Will and Viola's lovemaking with rehearsals for what becomes
``Romeo and Juliet.''
</P>
<P>
   The supporting cast is mostly in fine form from Ben Affleck's
self-centered stage ham to Geoffrey Rush's wee-bit-over-the-top
quirky play producer. And maybe Judi Dench did win an Oscar for
only a brief, brief turn as Queen Elizabeth, but it's in those
moments that ``Shakespeare in Love'' is completely her movie.
</P>
<P>
   The script is deftly written fluff, entirely engaging stuff that
pokes insidery fun at Hollywood egos and Broadway bombast.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, nothing in ``Shakespeare'' has the impact of the
first 30 minutes of ``Saving Private Ryan.'' But reel to reel, it
is the more entertaining movie. Grade: A-
</P>

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration. 
 Copyright 1999 Bernard Gladstone 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: We are planning to build a new house and several of our new
neighbors tell us there is a problem with dampness and water
seeping into their basements. We want to do everything we can to
prevent such problems, even if it costs a bit more during
construction. What are some of the important steps you would
recommend that the builder should do to insure a dry basement?
</P>
<P>
   A: If most of the seepage is due to ground water make sure that
the footing has drain tile (perforated plastic pipe) laid in the
soil on the outside, as well as under the basement floor as shown
here. The tiles should be covered with a layer of gravel, and each
run of pipe should slope slightly toward an underground ``dry
well'' or seepage area at least 10 feet away from the foundation.
After the foundation is poured, the outside walls should be covered
with waterproof mastic and membrane before backfilling with soil.
Also insist that all gutters and downspouts direct rain water away
from the foundation walls, and make sure that the soil around the
outside is graded so that it slopes away from the foundation on all
sides of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We put up an outdoor storage shed in our backyard and painted
this to match the house. We use well water for our sprinkler system
and apparently there are some minerals in the water that have left
rust-colored stains on the paint. How can we clean these stains
off, and is there a paint we can use that will resist such staining
in the future?
</P>
<P>
   A: The best way to remove rust stains is to use a commercial
rust remover of the type sold in most hardware stores and home
centers. Usually you can dilute this somewhat, but check the
directions on the package. If you are going to repaint, apply a
first coat of a stain-killing sealer such as Kilz, BIN or similar
product. Then paint as usual. As far as preventing this from
happening in the future _ there is no simple answer. If the rust is
coming from the pipes or other plumbing components, then you will
have to replace them with parts that do not rust. If the rust is
coming from the actual well water, then you may have to install a
suitable filter to get rid of the rust. You might also try to
adjust or even move some of the sprinkler heads so that no water
hits the side of the shed when the system is running.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our apartment is built on a concrete slab and the landlord
recently had someone take out the wall-to-wall carpeting and
install sheet linoleum on all the floors. The seams kept coming up
so the maintenance man who installed it was called back to fix the
seams. He admitted this was the first time he had installed
linoleum, but that he would fix the seams by using a different
adhesive. However, in a few weeks the seams started coming up
again. What can we do to keep the seams down tight against the
concrete slab?
</P>
<P>
   A: I must explain that the sheet material installed on your
floors is probably not linoleum _ that product has not been made,
or even sold, in this country for many years. Your flooring is most
likely some type of sheet vinyl. It sounds as though your installer
did not use the proper adhesive, or may not have properly prepared
the floor beforehand. Either way, I think you will have to call in
a more experienced installer, or contact the manufacturer or dealer
who sold the flooring to find out the proper adhesive that should
be used.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Our bathroom has a sink made of ``cultured marble'' that is
over 5 years old. This sink has many fine hairline cracks around
the drain at the bottom. They do not seem to be getting any worse,
but is there anything I should do to prevent the cracks from
getting larger?
</P>
<P>
   A. Such cracks are most often caused by the fact that the drain
fitting when originally installed was tightened too much, thus
causing the plastic material to crack. Another possible cause is
allowing very hot water to run continuously into the sink, although
this is not often the case. Chances are that since there has been
no change in five years the condition has stabilized, but you can
contact one of the special companies that repair such sinks if you
want the cracks repaired. Check with an appliance dealer in your
area for the name of a such a company.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about home-repair problems should be addressed to
Bernard Gladstone, care of The New York Times Syndication Sales
Corp., 122 E. 42nd St., New York, N.Y. 10168. Questions of general
interest will be answered in this column; Mr. Gladstone regrets
that unpublished letters cannot be answered individually.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Drawing captioned ``DRAINAGE SYSTEM'' goes with this
column.
</P>
<P>
   CAPTION: Drain pipes on each side of footing, as well as
waterproof membrane on outside of foundation walls, will help keep
moisture out of basement.

Thursday, Aug. 12, sent to computer graphics clients of The New

(bl) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A battery of heavy showers and thunderstorms will lash the upper
Middle West on Thursday in response to a volatile mix of
ingredients coming together over the northern Plains, upper
Mississippi Valley and western Great Lakes. As a compact but potent
jet stream disturbance emerges from the Rockies on Thursday
morning, an area of surface low pressure will intensify over
eastern South Dakota. In turn, the strengthening low will rapidly
draw very humid air northward over a warm front, setting the stage
for heavy thunderstorms over parts of Wisconsin, eastern Minnesota
and west-central Michigan. Some of these storms will produce
prodigious rainfall rates as high as 2 inches an hour. Flash
flooding is likely. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moderate to locally heavy rains are possible farther north over
North Dakota, northern Minnesota and northern Michigan, where humid
air interacts with a stalled cool front.
</P>
<P>
   Fierce thunderstorms, with the potential of spawning severe
weather, will erupt over the upper Mississippi Valley and then
rumble into Illinois and Indiana. Downpours are also possible from
these storms. To the west, moist winds ascending the sloping
terrain of the western Dakotas and Montana will pave the way for
showers and thunderstorms, some of which will be heavy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, heat will persist over the southern Plains, with
isolated thunderstorms bringing only brief, spotty relief.
</P>
<P>
   A warming trend will continue throughout much of the Northeast
and northern Middle Atlantic states. There is little chance for
rain.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: The Real Season
</P>
<P>
   Although there has been only one named storm in the tropical
Atlantic this year, the real hurricane season is just beginning.
Though the interval June 1 through November 30 is the official
hurricane season in the Atlantic, the period between mid-August to
mid-October marks the time when most tropical storms occur. Roughly
70 percent of all Atlantic tropical storms and hurricanes form
between August 10 and October 20. This period typically corresponds
to the time when tropical seas are warmest, the most important
factor in the development of the greatest storms on earth.

   NEW YORK _ New Yorkers are comfortable with sidewalks. So
comfortable, in fact, that they're bringing them indoors.
</P>
<P>
   Concrete _ the soot-gray sidewalk variety _ is making an inside
appearance as fashionable flooring in Chelsea art galleries, retail
spaces like Versace on Madison Avenue and Banana Republic in SoHo
and now residences from downtown lofts to uptown town houses.
Street culture has taken a literal turn.
</P>
<P>
   Concrete and cement, the limey stuff that's at the heart of it,
might have had an image problem _ mobster men's wear _ but no more.
The ex-taxi garages and industrial buildings with the heavy-duty
concrete floors that now house upscale businesses like Jeffrey, a
10,000-square-foot boutique that arrived in the meat-packing
district last week (stepping over the chicken-blood stains in the
sidewalk) have provoked a wave of new floor-pouring.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Parr opened a 5,000-square-foot modern design gallery
with a troweled concrete floor on West 20th St. in May. ``I can't
tell you how many people have come in, with their architects, to
see my floor,'' he said. ``It's like floor envy _ it's so silly.''
</P>
<P>
   Parr delayed the opening of his space several months, as two
consultants and a second crew with terrazzo-polishing machines
massaged the floor to get the surface right. It cost him an extra
$7,600.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about the oldest, dumbest surface that people do
their garages in because it's cheap,'' Parr said.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Damon and Gwyneth Paltrow's architects, Michael Pierce and
D.D. Allen, are talking to them about concrete flooring for their
New York addresses. Donna Karan just wrote a check for it in East
Hampton. Claire Danes and Robert Redford have already got it.
Calvin Klein is selling his home collection off of it in a new
advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the brute architectural moment typified by Tadao
Ando's monastic concrete houses in Japan. Or the polychromatic or
the stamped-to-look-like-stone concrete that has become popular as
a suburban building material.
</P>
<P>
   This is perfectly ordinary concrete _ emphasis on the perfect.
But there's nothing plain about it. It is finished to within an
inch of its life. The Portland cement mix is selected for shade.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Boone, the art dealer, and Rei Kawakubo, the clothing
designer, wanted white over gray. The poured surface is
stainless-steel troweled by machine, not hand, which produces a
clear skin with no browning from metal abrasion. The floor is
sealed with Miracle 511 Porous Plus, the chemical product of
choice, which gives a subtler shine than silicone. At $200 a
gallon, it's the Giaconda's smile. Then the floor is paste-waxed,
like furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Concrete can cost more than marble, up to $50 a square foot. It
is like making a sidewalk out of silk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something prosaic made to look perfect,'' said Richard
Gluckman, an architect with Gluckman Mayner Architects in New York,
who is considered by many the king of the concrete floor because of
his extensive resume of art gallery renovations. Gluckman has done
spaces for Paula Cooper, Larry Gagosian and Andrea Rosen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's trying to outthink the process,'' said John
Houshmand, a partner with Clark Construction Corp., which did Ms.
Boone's floor. ``The most perfect floors you will ever see are
right out of the concrete truck.''
</P>
<P>
   Azzarone Contracting Corp., another concrete-to-the-stars salon
(think Grauman's with a reverse emphasis) did the Versace and Comme
des Garcons floors. Alan Bouknight, Azzarone's president, called
concrete ``the Timex watch of construction materials,'' but he
said, ``I'm into it on a religious level.''
</P>
<P>
   Bouknight puts the same drivers on the same mixing truck for the
same client, to get consistency over the length of a job.
``Concrete's commonplace,'' he said. ``It's been around since the
time of the Romans. We're taking it to a higher plane.''
</P>
<P>
   The air fare is higher, too. ``Most people's experience with
concrete is a sidewalk,'' he said. ``Three dollars a square foot.
You come in at 10 times that, they're shocked. They look at you
like you're a thief.'' It doesn't rattle Bouknight's artistic
temperament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking mud and making it beautiful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In its short, sweet celebrity, the trend already has a curve.
Ms. Rosen, whose concrete floor on West 24th Street went down a
year and a half ago, chose to make it ``as simple as possible,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Middle-range and normal, I didn't want it to be high-end and
polished,'' Ms. Rosen explained, citing Ms. Cooper's floor, which
went down three years ago, as an example of the ``perfected,
controlled'' concrete she didn't want.
</P>
<P>
   The contractor gave her the deadpan look. The job was uncosmetic
and cheaper. Concrete without makeup looks like concrete, a fact
that Ms. Rosen is learning to live with, with expensive help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a floor person come in who did acid washes to try to
get the footprints off,'' she said, referring to what appeared to
be permanent tracks in the surface, left by non-salon installers
who thought they were installing a concrete floor.
</P>
<P>
   Concrete also yellows, as though it is developing jaundice. ``It
was really beautiful when it was laid,'' Ms. Rosen said. ``Every
day after that was a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rosen shouldn't fret. Fashion has discovered history.
Matthew Marks declined to remove the scars from the existing
concrete in his gallery, a former cutlery factory on West 24th
Street, restoring it instead to what contractors are calling a
``concrete document.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Kalinsky, the namesake owner of Jeffrey, on West 14th
Street, instructed his architects, Pierce and Ms. Allen, to do the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gorgeous,'' he said, standing in brown satin Alexander
McQueen jeans, a diamond and sapphire bracelet on his right wrist
and a silver horse-buckle-and-bit bracelet on his left, on a floor
that looked more beat-up than Brando in ``On the Waterfront.'' The
boutique is a former factory lobby with a fragrance counter where
the loading dock was.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how much it would have cost to put in a concrete
floor like this today?'' Kalinsky asked.
</P>
<P>
   More than its much-appreciated aesthetic modesty would permit it
to say.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

</P>
<P>
   Concrete has always had powerful friends in the architectural
community: Le Corbusier, Eero Saarinen, more lately, Rem Koolhaas
and Maya Lin.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Rose, an architect based in Cambridge, Mass., who designed
the Canadian Center for Architecture in Montreal, is leaving
concrete floors exposed in a town house being completed on the
Upper East Side. Though it is his first residential use of
concrete, Rose has no qualms about the rough-and-ready mix material
being caught short in an elegant setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has an organic quality because it's a raw material,'' he
said. ``It is the beauty of concrete that it is irregular. It's not
one color; it's a hundred grays.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a hundred and counting if it stains, which it will find a
way to do; it absorbs like a good student. The problem: unlike
stone, concrete goes down as a single surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put marble down in pieces,'' Bouknight said. ``If anything
goes wrong, you put a new piece down. Concrete _ anything goes
wrong, you have to patch it.'' Its organic virtues become natural
disasters. ``Different batches of sand and cement from different
places _ they're different colors. It's going to look patched,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tough but tender, concrete cracks under pressure. Contractors
like Houshmand and Bouknight put control joints in them, to direct
the stresses, like sidewalk seams. Clients like David Bers, an
architect in New York, choose concrete because ``there are no
markings, no grout lines like tile,'' he said. ``It has a scaleless
quality. It's like a pond.''
</P>
<P>
   Except that it's hard as a rock. Something's got to give. It's
usually the floor, then the client. Bers compared concrete floors
to the vogue for exposed brick in the 1970s, now an architectural
trivia clue. ``I've always wanted to do a black-top floor,'' he
said, hedging his bets.
</P>
<P>
   But basic concrete hits it off in the right crowd. Roberta
Arena, a retired banker, asked her architect, Katherine Chia of
Desai Chia Studio in New York, to put concrete down in the
bathrooms in her TriBeCa loft, based on a shower stall she saw at a
hotel in Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're terrific,'' Ms. Arena said. ``Never hot or cold;
they're not slippery. It's a good pedicure _ they're like walking
on sand.'' They're also popular at parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always a few guests in there, usually men in suits,
who end up in there drinking,'' she said. ``I think it reminds them
of a locker room.''

ELECTRONIC DEVICES TAKING THE GRUNT WORK OUT OF NAVIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By CATHERINE GREENMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before electronic navigation equipment became commonly available
a few years ago, anyone sailing a midsize boat could have used a
few extra arms to handle the helm, check the radar, take compass
bearings and plot a course on a paper chart.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, boaters can relax a little. Increasingly, electronic
devices like global positioning systems are taking some of the
grunt work out of navigation.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of plotting a course with compasses and paper charts,
for example, a navigator can use a GPS unit to instantly provide
the boat's latitude and longitude. And while global positioning
technology has been used by commercial and recreational boaters for
almost 10 years, navigation software now allows boaters to make
better use of it.
</P>
<P>
   Linked to a GPS receiver, a laptop computer can tell the boater
which way to head and track the journey on digitized nautical
charts on the computer screen. And when navigators of larger
sailboats and powerboats hook their global positioning devices to
an autopilot, they might even be able to take a break while the
computer steers the boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Electronic navigation has become so accurate that many boaters
feel more comfortable exploring new areas outside of where they
usually travel,'' said Dan Nowlan, director of offshore racing at
U.S. Sailing, an organization based in Portsmouth, R.I., that
governs public sailing activity in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But as reliable and easy to use as these tools are becoming,
they will not make a Magellan out of a Gilligan. Boating experts
caution that knowing how to navigate with paper charts is still
important. ``GPS and the electronic maps make it easy to figure out
where you are,'' said Dan Reich, who sails a 50-foot boat off the
eastern tip of Long Island. ``But a novice who doesn't know how to
read charts might have a hard time of it if something went wrong
with the technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of experience, many boaters who embark on weekend
cruises or outside of familiar ports now rely on handheld GPS
devices and PC software to do the bulk of the navigation. In
addition to life vests and VHF radios or cell phones to call for
help, global positioning systems rank high on the list of onboard
equipment. The devices, which receive signals from satellites to
determine location, are steadily replacing Loran technology, which
relies on line-of-sight radio signals from land-based towers. Where
Loran only works up to about 200 miles offshore, GPS signals can be
received anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Today, typical global positioning systems made by companies like
Garmin Electronics, Raytheon and Magellan sell for less than $200,
a fraction of what they cost three or four years ago, making the
devices affordable to the weekend boater.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Maptech, Pinpoint Systems and Nobeltec make
navigational software that works with GPS devices. These programs,
which come in CD format, can be overlaid on top of digitized
government charts that render everything from water depth and
numbered buoys to lighthouses, rocks and sandbars. Working
together, the GPS unit and software constantly upgrade the boat's
position on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   The software can also be used to plan trips. A boater sailing
from New York to Block Island, off the coast of Rhode Island, for
the weekend, for example, could plan various routes by clicking on
a series of destination points on maps of the Long Island and Block
Island Sounds. The software calculates the distances between
destination points, total distance and estimated travel time. It's
easier than figuring out a route by hand.
</P>
<P>
   With a route planned, the boater gets onboard, plugs the GPS
device into the computer and lets the software point the way. Most
navigation programs show a trail of ``bread crumbs'' on the chart,
providing a record of the boater's route that can be particularly
helpful in racing and fishing.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to nautical charts, the navigation software
companies also reproduce topographical maps showing details of the
land like major streets and elevations that are useful when boaters
disembark. They can also be used with GPS devices.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Maptech also released Photo Regions, which when
displayed side-by-side on the screen with the government charts
displays an image of the coastline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Photographic maps are one of the hottest things in boating
technology,'' said Kevin Falvo, technical editor of Boating
magazine. ``People get a kick out of saying, `Ooh look, there's so
and so's dock' or `There's our house.'''
</P>
<P>
   Although global positioning devices, laptops and navigational
software have made it easier for less experienced boaters to pilot
sailboats and powerboats with more confidence, experienced sailors,
sailing organizations and even the manufacturers of navigational
software agree on the dangers of overreliance on the technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Electronic navigation has become so reliable that we joke that
you could program your computer and GPS to sail your boat out of
the harbor in South Carolina and take a plane to meet it in
Florida,'' said Milt Baker, president of Bluewater Books and
Charts, a company based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., that sells
electronic charts. ``But one stray electron or one dead battery and
you're out of business. You have to know how to navigate and read
charts on your own.''
</P>
<P>
   Commander Michael Lipinski, a spokesman for the United States
Coast Guard, said GPS devices and electronic charts have made it
easier for boaters in trouble to tell the Coast Guard their
whereabouts. ``It used to be that when someone would call in and
we'd say, `Where are you?' they might give a vague description like
`We're an hour outside of an inlet.' But electronic navigation lets
them give an exact latitude and longitude right away. It reduces
the amount of time we need to plan a response.''
</P>
<P>
   As popular as electronic navigation has become, there are some
boaters who prefer to navigate with paper charts. Some don't want
to make the investment. (Although prices for G.P.S devices have
come down, a complete navigation system with a global positioning
system, software and a laptop can cost up to $2,500.) Some boaters
still prefer the wider scope of a standard 3-by-4-foot paper map to
a laptop screen.
</P>
<P>
   Others rely on paper charts because laptops aren't easily
visible in bright daylight. To tackle this problem, companies like
Pinpoint Systems manufacture computers with extra-bright LCD
displays that also incorporate global positioning and electronic
charting systems. Such devices can run up to $6,000. Garmin
Electronics and Magellan manufacture lower-priced devices that
eliminate the need to bring a laptop along. They are GPS units with
built-in navigation software; they cost about $600 to $700 but have
lower-resolution displays.
</P>
<P>
   But even the most experienced boaters say they their GPS devices
and software are becoming indispensable. ``I've moved as much as 35
miles a day in a fog that I can only see two boat lengths
through,'' said Jerry Lipitas, who sails a 44-foot boat along the
Maine coastline with a laptop and GPS device at his side. ``Without
having to concentrate so much on the direction, I can spend a lot
more time focusing on what's in front of me.''

CONFESSIONS OF A GAY EAGLE SCOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The topic of the New Jersey Supreme Court decision last week
preventing the Boy Scouts of America from excluding homosexuals
came up recently at my local watering hole. I was in mid-rant about
how Scouting wasn't meant to be discriminatory, pounding my fist on
the bar for dramatic emphasis, when the friend I was talking to
suddenly piped up, ``You know, I was an Eagle Scout.''
</P>
<P>
   Some guy behind us spun on his Cole-Haan heel, snatched his
cigarette from his lips, and said, smokily, ``I was, too.''
</P>
<P>
   After an informal poll of the folks standing around the pool
tables, I'd counted 10 former Eagle Scouts _ that's not even
counting all the Cubs, Webelos and Scouts who gave up after
reaching the Star or Life ranks.
</P>
<P>
   So what attracted all these now openly gay clubgoers to an
organization devoted to turning greenhorns into morally upstanding
young men?
</P>
<P>
   You can make all the cracks you want about snazzy uniforms or
knot-tying and leather crafts, but the truth is that everyone I
talked to that night admitted to taking away something special from
their scouting experiences.
</P>
<P>
   I reached the rank of Eagle at the tender age of 14, a hormonal
fashion victim fortunate enough to receive the adolescent treasures
of acne, braces and corrective lenses all in the same week. So no,
you will NOT be seeing the photo that ran in my local suburban
newspaper at the time.
</P>
<P>
   When I first joined Gulf Coast Council Troop 306, the group had
just been taken over by a stern, ex-military man who was
disheartened that our only form of exercise was trekking
door-to-door hawking tickets to the annual Scout Craft Fair. He was
determined to turn us into a lean, mean backpacking troop, so while
the other wimps shlepped up to Camp Karankawa to ``rough it'' with
concrete picnic tables and restrooms, we were walking 10 miles into
the woods of some of Texas' finest parks _ scaring the bejabbers
out of one another with local legends that made the Blair Witch
seem like a bedtime story _ and sleeping under the stars.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always easy. We were idiots at first, living off
Pop-Tarts and lugging clunky cassette players into the woods so we
could listen to tapes of the Dr. Demento show. But after a few
years of learning from our own mistakes, we were dining on shish
kebabs and peach cobbler in front of a crackling fire, while the
tenderfoots were shivering in their tents eating Swiss Miss instant
cocoa powder.
</P>
<P>
   I made some the best friends of my life in Scouts. When we
pulled up the garters on our knee-high socks and tightened our
neckerchief slides, we were united by more than just silly outfits.
We were a part of something older and bigger than any of us, and
nothing drove the point home to me more than sitting in a throng of
thousands of Scouts at the 1981 National Jamboree in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Making Eagle Scout remains one of the proudest days of mine and
my parents' lives. On reflection, one of the reasons I think I've
run into so many gay former Eagle Scouts is that we seem to be
meticulous enough to complete the tasks it takes to achieve the
rank. After surviving merit badges like Citizenship in the
Community, Nation and World, those 10-mile hikes seemed like
strolls around the block. And while I may not have known I was gay
at the time, there were always hints: My Eagle Scout project was to
put on two variety shows for area retirement homes (and my folks
said they didn't know).
</P>
<P>
   This argument about allowing gays into Scouting has as much
validity as the debate over gays in the military. We've always been
in Scouting, and we always will be. Who do you think came up with
the (figure) Skating merit badge? What's next? Are they gonna add
``don't ask, don't tell'' to the initiation ceremony?
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing that would exclude gays in the Scout Oath and
Law _ I know, because I still have them memorized. And when
Scouting founder Sir Robert Baden-Powell coined the phrase
``physically strong, mentally awake and morally straight,'' I don't
think it had the same connotation.
</P>
<P>
   I may not be ``straight,'' but there's nothing wrong with my
morality. I just hope that other gay kids out there get a chance to
take advantage of the great things Scouting did for me. Otherwise,
the only thing they'll learn to ``be prepared'' for is bigotry.

 &HT;    AMERICAN AIRLINES RECEIVES MOST AIR TRAVEL COMPLAINTS
 &HT;    With AIRLINE-LIST. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the exception of Southwest Airlines, customer
complaints about nearly every major U.S. air carrier jumped sharply
in the first half of this year, the U.S. Department of
Transportation reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines was criticized the most in the department's
latest six-month review.
</P>
<P>
   Flight delays and cancellations were the top cause of traveler
dissatisfaction, with customer service ranking second. Over all,
the industry's complaint rate per 100,000 passengers doubled, from
0.93 for the first half of last year to 1.86 for the same period
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really been an awful year,'' said Darryl Jenkins, an
aviation professor at George Washington University, who called 1999
one of the worst for air travel since airlines were deregulated a
decade ago. He blamed congestion in the skies, inside airports and
in airplanes and said both the federal government and airlines have
failed to respond.
</P>
<P>
   Hardest hit by delays, American Airlines was cited in 1,067 of
the total 5,005 complaints registered with the federal government
from January through June. The Fort Worth, Texas-based carrier has
also been at or near the bottom for on-time performance in the
six-month standings.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest, a no-frills airline which offers up spare service and
little food but a tradition of friendly informality, received the
fewest complaints by a wide margin. In 31.5 million passenger trips
flown, only 92 customers registered complaints. Dallas-based
Southwest also ranked first or near the top for on-time arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   But the rest of the industry was a target for a rising number of
complaints by letter, phone and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we don't like that,'' said American Airlines
spokesman Tim Smith, who blamed several factors, including a 12-day
sick-out by American's pilots last February and extraordinarily
harsh spring weather. He also pointed to the Federal Aviation
Administration's overhaul of air traffic control equipment for
causing flight delays.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Smith said that it's much easier to complain now that
customers can easily file complaints to the Transportation
Department on an Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Airlines spokesman John Kennedy seconded that point in
explaining why Delta received more than double the complaints it
received a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crowded airports and unprecedented delays on the air and
ground due to a congested traffic control system have combined to
cause unpleasant experiences for some travelers _ many travelers,
to be truthful,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he said, Delta was pleased that its percentage of
complaints gave it the third best ranking after Southwest and
Alaska airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Although airlines have promised improvements, Jenkins warned not
to expect them soon. ``It's been a bad year,'' he said. ``It will
get worse before it ever gets better.''
</P>
<P>
   The aviation expert said that antiquated aviation infrastructure
requires a major overhaul to relieve the congestion that's at the
root of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins said of air travel today: ``It's like going on a
four-lane highway when it goes down to one lane, and then imagine,
on top of that, an accident 20 miles down the road. That's what the
air traffic control system is like this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers will make a difference only ``if their complaints
would move Congress to get off their duff and give the FAA the
funding and the things they need,'' he said.

   Every time you sit down at a computer, you come into contact
with an item that has been pretty much unchanged for 15 years: the
keyboard. During that time _ an eon at today's technological pace _
mice have multiplied, monitors have grown and microprocessors have
become exponentially more powerful. But like some awful new-wave
band, the standard PC keyboard has remained mired in the early
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   It has not remained that way because the design is optimal _
quite the contrary. Many designers criticize the keyboard for
serving a befuddling mix of obsolete needs. Of the sprawling 101
keys on the standard keyboard, a good number are either redundant,
confusing or vestigial.
</P>
<P>
   While the Esc key often does escape, Pause seldom pauses. These
days few people can articulate what SysRq is. At least Microsoft
revived Print Scrn from the depths of obsolescence by using it for
a screen-shot function in Windows. Perhaps one day Microsoft will
find a scroll to lock for ScrLk.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these old buttons on the keyboard are literally the
carrying over of the original sin,'' said Regis Magyar, one of the
designers who worked on the standard keyboard design, which was
introduced by the International Business Machines Corp. in 1984.
``We sort of need an exorcist to clean these keyboards out now.''
</P>
<P>
   The illogic doesn't stop there. The keys for the comma and the
period, along with keys for opening and closing parentheses and
brackets, are all next to each other, but the forward slash and the
backward slash are two rows away from each other. And someone
should explain why the Caps Lock light is often on the opposite end
of the keyboard from the Caps Lock button.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, as engineers have realized over the years,
renovating one of the most entrenched designs in computer history
is nearly impossible. Few other items are used on a regular basis
by as many people who have developed a skill set around it. And new
keyboards must be compatible with a huge array of existing
software, making the removal of keys difficult.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, debates over keyboards are a little like debates
over the federal budget. Everybody wants spending cuts, as long as
it doesn't affect them.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are always hesitant to take away a key, because it was
there for some reason and you don't want to be the one to take it
away and not have some application out there work anymore,'' said
John Karidis, an engineer at IBM.
</P>
<P>
   The keyboard's entrenchment has become worldwide, conquering
even nations that don't have primary languages based on the Roman
alphabet. Japan and China, for example, have adapted to the
standard keyboard, with many users finding it easier to type
Romanized phonetic words on the 101-key keyboard and have the
computer convert them into Chinese and Japanese characters.
</P>
<P>
   Keyboards constructed around the 50 Japanese ``katakana''
phonetic characters were too bulky compared with the standard Roman
keyboards, said Izumi Kimura, a Japanese technology historian.
Users showed a preference for the 101-key keyboard, with its
smaller alphabet. ``I personally think that the number of keys has
been decisive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The standard keyboard design was arrived at in a relatively
arbitrary manner, a combination of legacies and historical
accidents that began with the patent of the so-called Qwerty
typewriter in 1878. The Qwerty layout, named for the first six
letters of the top row, is the subject of much debate. The layout
was designed by C.L. Sholes during the late 1860s so that
typewriter hammers would not get caught on one another. A result,
intended or not, was that it slowed down typists. Even now, the
layout is criticized for overworking the weaker ring and pinky
fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Alternative layouts emerged, most notably the Dvorak keyboard,
which was patented in 1932 by August Dvorak and W.L. Dealey. But a
number of studies have shown that it is only 6 percent to 10
percent faster than Qwerty, enough for a niche following but not
enough for typists to throw out Qwerty and relearn touch-typing.
Qwerty has its proponents, too. Brian Shacklel, professor emeritus
of human sciences at Loughborough University in England, said that
Qwerty is actually near optimal, primarily because it allows many
keystrokes to be made by alternate hands.
</P>
<P>
   As computer keyboards evolved from typewriters, extra keys were
added to accommodate the proliferation of new functions. If the
``hardware wars'' between marketers, engineers and accountants had
worked out differently at IBM, Magyar said, we all might be using
vertical-only Enter keys and a half-size Backspace key.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these decisions were political and economic compromises,''
he said. ``The bean counters didn't care how much users liked it.''
</P>
<P>
   In spite of its flaws, the design inspired many copycats after
it was introduced. ``Radio Shack said, `if the big boys did it,
we'll do it,''' Magyar said. ``Compaq said IBM must be right. So
everyone copied us.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years, the 101-key layout became the industry
standard for PC's. Even Apple Macintoshes adopted similar
keyboards, but with Command instead of Control keys and Option
instead of Alt.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the keyboard's quirks are left over from the time when
engineers had to balance the needs of older mainframes and the
emerging PCs. Keys like SysRq, Pause and Break are relics from the
mainframe era. Ins, Del, Home, Page Up, End and the arrow keys were
all introduced for editing functions to fill out forms on
mainframes. Scroll Lock and Print Screen were developed for the DOS
operating system. But as software and hardware has become more
sophisticated, the keyboard has remained the same.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One of the great curiosities is the Num Lock key, which allows
users to toggle between number keys (which exist elsewhere on the
keyboard) and arrow and utility keys in a single keypad area (which
also exist elsewhere on the keyboard). In fact, the entire 17 keys
of the number keypad make up a wholly redundant area of the
keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone hates Num Lock,'' said Dr. Magyar, who noted that the
number keypad was created to accommodate spreadsheets. But even as
the other utilities gained independent real estate, the redundancy
remained to accommodate old software. ``Num Lock is a dead key as
far as I am concerned,'' Magyar said.
</P>
<P>
   But one constituency remains faithful to the key. ``Num Lock is
pretty valuable to players of many first-person games like Quake,''
said Dan Horn, a University of Michigan graduate student who has
done research on keyboard designs, ``because the number pad allows
users to move diagonally more easily than the dedicated arrow
buttons where two key presses are necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the keyboard's design is arbitrary. The inverted-T
format of the arrow keys was chosen for its efficiency. An analysis
of typists by the Digital Equipment Corp. revealed that the most
common switch between two keys was from the down-arrow key to the
left-arrow key, so those keys were put next to each other,
according to Michael Good, who worked on the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the late '70s and early '80s, the arrow key functions
were all over the keyboard,'' Good said. ``Wordstar had them as
control keys on the regular keyboard. Other people had them on the
numeric keypad. They were arranged in squares and diamonds.''
Magyar caught sight of Digital's inverted-T design in a computer
magazine during the early 1980s, and adopted it for the IBM
keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as IBM's standard keyboard emerged in 1984, competitors
rushed to copy it. Some other keyboard designs were left trampled
at the sidelines, including one developed at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology called Etude that included keys for many of
today's commonly used functions like undo, cut, copy and paste.
Though Macintosh computers originally had simpler keyboards when
they were introduced in 1984, they soon offered extended keyboards
that paralleled the PC 101-key model. But the relatively new Apple
iMac has a streamlined keyboard. ``The iMac keyboard is hugely
downsized, making people both happy and sad,'' Amelia Morrow, a
longtime Macintosh owner, said. Along the way, some additional keys
have been introduced, most notably the three extra iconic keys _
two Windows keys and a menu key _ on Microsoft's Natural Keyboard,
which have half-heartedly been accepted by users since their
introduction in 1994. ``It's hard to see why they bothered with the
keys,'' said Richard Penn, who considers the Windows keys useless
and redundant. ``I think it came from a marketing goal to `brand'
the keyboard, rather than a usability goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the design pressures affecting keyboards have to do with
the shrinking size of personal devices like subnotebook computers.
Typically, the number pad is the first to go, then the large keys
get trimmed, then the entire keyboard is shrunk. One ingenious
design was IBM's butterfly-concept keyboard on the Thinkpad, which
is made up of two halves that fold up when the laptop is closed.
</P>
<P>
   Another attempt to save space is the chordal keyboard, versions
of which have appeared since the late 1980s. It has far fewer keys
and takes up less space. A chordal keyboard requires simultaneous
key presses for each character typed, similar to playing a musical
chord on a piano. With as few as 5 keys, there are 31 chord
combinations that may represent letters, numbers, words, commands
or other strings. But they take a great deal more training, and are
a lot less intuitive.
</P>
<P>
   A number of companies have made one-handed Qwerty keyboards.
One-handed keyboards were first developed in conjunction with the
mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Until voice-recognition or some other interface takes over, the
keyboard will probably remain largely the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because novices are flocking to computers in droves to get on
the Web, there is going to be more pressure to make computers as
easy to use as possible,'' said Horn, who uses a Dvorak keyboard.
``People are comfortable with the current style of keyboard. Even
if they are not good typists, they understand how the keyboard
works, and can get by with hunt-and-peck strategies.''

 &HT;    AMERICAN AIRLINES RECEIVES MOST AIR TRAVEL COMPLAINTS
 &HT;    With AIRLINE-LIST. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the exception of Southwest Airlines, customer
complaints about nearly every major U.S. air carrier jumped sharply
in the first half of this year, the U.S. Department of
Transportation reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines was criticized the most in the department's
latest six-month review.
</P>
<P>
   Flight delays and cancellations were the top cause of traveler
dissatisfaction, with customer service ranking second. Over all,
the industry's complaint rate per 100,000 passengers doubled, from
0.93 for the first half of last year to 1.86 for the same period
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really been an awful year,'' said Darryl Jenkins, an
aviation professor at George Washington University, who called 1999
one of the worst for air travel since airlines were deregulated a
decade ago. He blamed congestion in the skies, inside airports and
in airplanes and said both the federal government and airlines have
failed to respond.
</P>
<P>
   Hardest hit by delays, American Airlines was cited in 1,067 of
the total 5,005 complaints registered with the federal government
from January through June. The Fort Worth, Texas-based carrier has
also been at or near the bottom for on-time performance in the
six-month standings.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest, a no-frills airline which offers up spare service and
little food but a tradition of friendly informality, received the
fewest complaints by a wide margin. In 31.5 million passenger trips
flown, only 92 customers registered complaints. Dallas-based
Southwest also ranked first or near the top for on-time arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   But the rest of the industry was a target for a rising number of
complaints by letter, phone and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we don't like that,'' said American Airlines
spokesman Tim Smith, who blamed several factors, including a 12-day
sick-out by American's pilots last February and extraordinarily
harsh spring weather. He also pointed to the Federal Aviation
Administration's overhaul of air traffic control equipment for

</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Smith said that it's much easier to complain now that

SENIOR ADVOCATES SAY CASH PENSION PLANS CAN HAVE COUNTERFEIT
BENEFITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CARL HULSE   
 NYT Regional Newspapers   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A growing effort by large employers to rejigger
their pension plans to serve younger, more mobile workers is
encountering opposition from senior advocates who contend that the
new approach shortchanges longtime employees.
</P>
<P>
   Called cash-balance plans, the new funds are a cross between
traditional pensions and 401(k) plans. Like a pension, the company
providing the retirement benefit sets aside a specific amount per
worker. But the value of the account is expressed in dollars,
making it easily transferable to a new job and understandable to
workers more accustomed to their IRAs and 401(k)s.
</P>
<P>
   Companies say the new method better suits modern workers who can
build up equity faster and are not likely to stay in a job long
enough to get the most out of a traditional pension.
</P>
<P>
   ``For today's employee, pensions are just not relevant
anymore,'' said Geoff Manville, a spokesman for the Erisa Industry
Committee, an association that lobbies on pension and benefit
issues for the nation's largest employers.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the increasingly popular conversion of benefits say
the companies have another incentive to make the switch _ money.
They say the move can save corporate dollars but cost older workers
who might see their potential payout decline under the new system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are companies changing to these cash-benefit plans?''
asked Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, on the Senate floor. ``The big
reason is the companies save millions of dollars. They save it
because the pensions provided for with almost all cash-balance
plans are, on average, far less generous.''
</P>
<P>
   Harkin and others complain that the opening account balances for
veteran employees can be set below the value of what a worker might
have accrued under the pension plan. Consequently, that worker
would see no real gain in pension benefits until the cash balance
catches up to the old program.
</P>
<P>
   Workers might not even realize what has happened. Lawmakers say
the employees can be dazzled by the new dollar figure in their
account and not understand it might total less than they would have
received under their old formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that very few workers who have experienced the
conversion of their company retirement plan to a cash-balance
arrangement understand the differences between the old and the new
plans,'' said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. ``Even more
disturbing are complaints from some employees that their employers
obscured the adverse effects of plan amendments.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan is pushing a measure that would require companies
changing plans for 1,000 employees or more to provide each worker
with an individualized statement comparing their benefits under
both approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The pension lobby is opposed to this approach, saying it would
create an accounting nightmare for companies. The industry is
supporting a less sweeping measure moving through Congress that
would require a more general notification to employees of potential
losses of benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin and others would like to halt the conversions altogether.
The senator and 11 Democratic House members wrote to IRS
Commissioner Charles Rossotti in July, urging a ban on cash-balance
plans on the grounds that they amount to age discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The industry association rejects that claim, saying the plans
are legal and a welcome new innovation in today's changing labor
and employment world.
</P>
<P>
   Cash-balance plans do have clear advantages for some segments of
the work force. A groundbreaking 1998 study by the Society of
Actuaries found that women, due to their relatively new place in
the work force, and younger workers who frequently change jobs fare
much better under cash-balance plans than with pensions that
require long service to maximize benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But that same study showed that employees 55 and older tend to
do better under the old plans. Some employers, sensitive to the
criticism, have taken steps to protect older workers, allowing them
to choose to remain in the old plan if they are nearing retirement.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not enough for sympathetic lawmakers and advocates
like the American Association of Retired Persons as they attempt to
slow the switch to cash-balance plans until the full impact can be
gauged.
</P>
<P>
   Such conversions, wrote AARP President Horace Deets in a recent
member bulletin, ``are not such a good deal for midlife and older
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just when a seasoned employee is about to get the most
valuable part of the pension plan,'' Deets said, ``it's all changed
and he or she does not have a clue what happened to his or her nest
egg.''

   PLAIN AN GWARRY, England _ Despite the best efforts of Druids
who had performed sun dances barefoot among magic stones for the
past several days, rain clouds, so often the spoiler of England's
summer, eclipsed the eclipse here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At 11 minutes past 11 o'clock, the hundreds of thousands of
people who journeyed here to the Duchy of Cornwall breathlessly
waiting in the darkened morning to see the last total eclipse of
the sun during this millennium saw little more than dark rain
clouds under a sky that got, well, darker.
</P>
<P>
   And the residents of Cornwall, one of the poorest English
counties, where much of the land is owned by Prince Charles, were
left with nothing to do but grumble over their pasties about an
event that was supposed to benefit the local economy and instead
left vacancy signs hanging from hotels and campsites.
</P>
<P>
   Scare stories about traffic congestion, health concerns and lack
of food and water kept paying customers away. The cosmic event
instead attracted a throng of New Age Travelers, pagans, druids and
solar worshippers who offered little in the way of money and were
left groping for meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels freaky,'' Lucie Mortimer, a Coca-Cola Co.
representative, said during the brief darkness that enveloped the
countryside. ``It's like God left to go to the toilet for two
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people here staring into the sky directly in the path of
the 70-mile wide track of totality, the complete blotting out of
the sun by the moon, had to face the fact that the weather
forecasters were actually right this time.
</P>
<P>
   In typical British understatement, Michael Heys, who had driven
800 miles from the north of Scotland with his wife and three boys,
said, ''This is a little disappointing.'' His wife, Sue, added: ''I
heard about the eclipse as a child and always wanted to go. But
missing it is OK.''
</P>
<P>
   This being the 1990s _ and another shot being unlikely because
the next total eclipse in Britain will not come until 2090 _ Teresa
Feton, 18, a student from Lancastershire, was prepared. She had
hedged her bets by setting her video recorder at home to tape the
event on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our British weather, but it didn't put me off coming
here,'' she said, huddling in her tent as the rain poured down.
</P>
<P>
   Many were still struck by the view they did have. ``It's like
one minute someone pulled the curtain down.'' said Brian Bennett, a
high school science teacher from Warwickshire. ``It's totally
bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the Moon interposed itself between the Sun and Earth
here for a little over two minutes, the shadow of the eclipse
whisked over the English Channel at 1,800 mph, beginning its
journey across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   There, millions of people shared mixed fortunes as areas
underneath the path of totality experienced varying weather
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In many parts of Europe where only a partial eclipse was
visible, but the weather was better, office workers stepped outside
for a brief glimpse.
</P>
<P>
   In London, where a 97 percent eclipse could be seen, some
commuters got off the Underground to see the view, just to get back
on and continue their journey.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, several hundred people popped open Champagne bottles
in front of the fashion designer Poco Rabanne's store to celebrate
the city's survival; Rabanne had predicted that the Russian space
station Mir would smash into Paris during the eclipse.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans, who had been hearing about the coming eclipse for
weeks through a relentless series of newspaper articles, radio and
television reports and plenty of commercial spinoffs, put special
viewing glasses on cats, dogs and horses.
</P>
<P>
   Even Pope John Paul II watched the eclipse through a darkened
lens at his summer residence in Castelgandolfo, south of Rome.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   However, even the celestial majesty of the moment could not help
undo the losses local businesses suffered from the lack of visitors
to the Cornish countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question the media and the local authorities
scared people off,'' said Claude Bennetts, who invested 150,000
pounds, or $242,000, in two campsites designed to accommodate
10,000 campers. Fewer than 500 showed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't have created a worse problem if you actually
tried,'' he said. ``It's happening all over Cornwall. It's not just
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen months ago the county hired Gage Williams, a retired
senior army officer, to oversee the logistics of the event, which
Williams predicted would bring 1.2 million people to Cornwall. Now
the local business community, in search of a scapegoat, is pointing
at Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a lot to answer for,'' said John Wells, a local mayor.
``He was a cannon ball that wasn't programmed right.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who could not be reached Wednesday for comment, told
The Cornish Guardian, ``Had we not highlighted the implications of
unprecedented numbers coming to the county for the eclipse, we
would not have galvanized those responsible into insuring that
there will be sufficient food, nor would we have implemented the
major improvements to the road network, which have now been put in
place and from which we will all benefit in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Traffic surveillance cameras, 250 extra police officers on
motorcycles and coast guards on horseback patrolling the cliffs and
beaches were part of the vast investment to monitor the hordes of
visitors expected to come by road and water. Supermarkets stocked
up with extra food and supplies and extended their hours to
accommodate.
</P>
<P>
   But just as the turnout failed to justify _ or repay _ all the
advance work, no amount of planning could guarantee good weather.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as a representative of the faithful, Edward Prynn, the
self-appointed Arch Druid of Cornwall, was surrendering no ground
to the weather or the weather forecasters: ``I had a vision last
night that it wasn't going to be a blue sky, but it was going to be
a beautiful, silver majestic atmosphere.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``What's astounding to people is my Silver Queen
corn,'' Barbara Schwartz said, pointing to a bumper crop _ 10 teeny
ears _ growing 16 stories up on the terrace of her Park Avenue
penthouse.
</P>
<P>
   So exotic is the spectacle of espaliered apples, wild
strawberries, blueberries, sweet potatoes, purple basil, runner
beans, garlic and cabbages thriving in containers amid Manhattan
skyscrapers that visitors invited to admire Ms. Schwartz's
contemporary art often reserve their gasps for her over-the-top
rooftop cornucopia. Immaculately manicured in keeping with its
owner's daunting standards for esthetic perfection, this vegetable
patch in the sky is tended by landscape designer Jon Carloftis, who
also set up a drip irrigation system, which kicks in at 5:30 a.m.,
and it is harvested daily by Ms. Schwartz's housekeeper, Beatrice
Murry.
</P>
<P>
   ``My garden has to be as perfect as my living room,'' said Ms.
Schwartz, a decorator and art consultant, whose collection of
vegetables vies for glory with works by Ross Bleckner, Cindy
Sherman and Julian Schnabel. ``I can't stand to have anything
that's not fresh. I'm always out here pruning and deadheading
before I go to work,'' she added, pausing to garnish a glass of
iced tea with a fresh sprig of pineapple mint as she led a visitor
on a summer tour of her potager. ``We have to clean the drains
every day to avoid clogging.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it living off the land, penthouse style.
</P>
<P>
   In a city with 11,788 retail food stores, 18,500 restaurants and
43 farmers' markets to support, scarcity of fresh produce is hardly
the motivation for New Yorkers to cultivate their own trophy
rooftop vegetables, from professionally tended Upper East Side
orangeries to walk-ups in Brooklyn where water is hauled up rickety
ladders to nourish minor forests of tomatoes and basil.
</P>
<P>
   Folks in New Jersey may be siphoning bath water for their lawns,
but no such drought measures have reached this city, whose
reservoirs are close to normal capacity despite exceedingly dry
conditions. Some Manhattan vegetable gardens continue to thrive on
a 150-gallon-a-day habit, the equivalent of flushing a toilet 94
times. If the situation changes, penthouse dwellers who run hoses
full blast may just have to resort to truckloads of Evian.
</P>
<P>
   While the likelihood of roof crops being devoured by groundhogs
or deer is somewhat slim, achieving a plentiful harvest is far from
easy. Vigilant watering, pruning, sweeping, fertilizing and
monitoring for blight and hungry insects _ let alone contending
with co-op restrictions on weight and watering _ are just a few of
the unscintillating chores for the aspiring rooftop farmer. And
those who lack the time or inclination to cultivate their own crops
soon discover that paying others to do it for them can be wildly
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them it costs them $100 a tomato,'' said Tim Du Val, an
owner of Plant Specialists, a garden design company in Long Island
City, Queens. He cautions clients to avoid what he regards as the
folly of penthouse agriculture. ``Most vegetables need a lot of
room, and they can suffer very easily if they go one day without
water,'' he noted. ``And they come into season when you can buy
them anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The going rate for rooftop garden maintenance in New York City
ranges from $35 to $40 an hour for basic labor to $50 to $75 an
hour for a head gardener. Elaborate penthouse vegetable gardens
might need 5 to 20 hours of attention a week in summer, a
per-gardener cost of some $700 to $4,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot cheaper to go to Balducci's, but people really love
it,'' said Carloftis, who tends 24 rooftop gardens in Manhattan,
six of which are resplendent with fruits, vegetables and herbs.
``It's about a basic human instinct,'' he added. ``There's nothing
like going out and eating a fresh tomato off your own vine.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even so, he conceded, people who spend top dollar on rooftop
maintenance are usually more interested in gazing at blooming trees
than in growing their own lunch.
</P>
<P>
   For those with the means and the imagination, New York rooftop
gardens can yield an astonishing variety of delicacies. On the
three-greenhouse terrace of George Gund's Fifth Avenue penthouse,
he cultivates 34 types of vegetables, herbs and fruits, including
figs, blood oranges, kumquats, key limes, papayas and guavas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of proud of it,'' said Gund, an itinerant
entrepreneur and philanthropist, calling from his private jet.
``I'd like to grow more but the building seems to object,'' he
added, alluding to the management at his co-op, which has also
forbidden him to install a drip irrigation system. Consequently,
each plant and tree has to be hand-watered by his gardener,
Marie-Jose Guepin, who spends about 12 hours a week toiling on the
terrace.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Gund noted, his papaya and guava trees refuse to yield
fruit, but he is hopeful. ``If someone tells me something won't
grow, it just makes me more determined, he said. ``I thrive on
adversity.'' His dream is to grow mangoes on Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   On a brief trip to New York in July, he seemed elated to
discover that a kumquat tree in a south-facing glasshouse on his
terrace is outproducing those he grows at his estate in Palm
Springs, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nurturing and growing things has always appealed to me,'' said
Gund, who said he enjoyed harvesting his family's corn, plums,
pears and peaches while growing up near Cleveland. That early
pleasure has evolved into a passion: when out of town for extended
periods, he has fruit plucked and sent to him overnight by Federal
Express. ``Sometimes I just fly in for a couple of hours to pick
fruit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When the temperature soared to 105 degrees in Fifth Avenue's
largest private penthouse garden, owned by a cosmetics tycoon and
his wife, the couple's head gardener sprang into action, hosing
down a bountiful supply of grapes, cucumbers, herbs and espaliered
apples. Phebe Jane Moore is one of two professional gardeners who
tend the spectacular 5,000-square-foot garden year round, putting
in some 40 hours a week spring and fall.
</P>
<P>
   Behind each pristine crop lurks a catalog of vexing horrors.
Apples are prey to unsightly cedar-apple rust, borers, woolly apple
aphids and apple scab. They need spraying every two weeks. For
esthetically perfect apples, Ms. Moore climbs a ladder early in the
summer to thin them so that they're six inches apart. ``You don't
want them to touch each other and get deformed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A seasoned horticulturist, Ms. Moore wryly remarked, ``It's an
artificial environment.'' Since the trees grow in chic but
restricting containers, each must be removed in November to have a
quarter of its roots pruned. It takes seven or eight people working
every day for two weeks to complete the job. The most laborious
tasks are the cleanup of fallen spring blossoms and autumn leaves,
when Ms. Moore spends long days just sweeping.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schwartz's cleanup can be equally challenging. For three
years, a mallard duck, possibly drawn by the bounty, has nested
with her ducklings on Ms. Schwartz's terrace, on the flight path
from the Central Park reservoir. ``I started to think, `This will
be great for my dinner parties _ 12 goslings,''' she said of their
novelty value. But they were messy house guests. Exasperated, she
called city authorities and was put through to a number for
endangered wildlife. ``They said, `A duck's not an endangered
species.' I said, `This one's  &UR; really &LR;  endangered cause I'm gonna
kill her.''' Exit the ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Neda Nickzad, a furniture designer, has also felt the forces of
nature. These days, she uses a bucket, not a hose, to water
eggplants and tomatoes in the rooftop garden of her Perry Street
apartment house. Last year, water seeped through the roof, causing
extensive damage to her ceiling, and she is taking no chances.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, a parched rooftop garden belonging to
supermodel Amber Valletta serves as a cautionary reminder of the
perils of neglect. A lemon tree, which yielded eye-catching fruit
last year, is just one casualty in a pitifully denuded rooftop
forest. After posing for Vogue amid the lush persimmon, banana,
avocado and plum trees last summer for an article in which she
extolled the joys of nature, Ms. Valletta seems to have moved on to
other pleasures.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal was for Amber to have enough stuff growing on the roof
to be able to feed herself when she's in town,'' said David Browne,
a neighborhood florist, who stocked Ms. Valletta's terrace garden.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, not even a supermodel could be sustained by the garden in
its present state. ``We've watered for her before, but she told us
she didn't want us to,'' Browne said. ``She said she has to repair
the roof.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking a decidedly more hands-on approach, Brooklyn roommates
Hans Steiner and Walter Swett first collected an eccentric array of
plant containers _ drawers, restaurant containers and an old
kitchen sink _ and then bought 40 50-pound bags of soil. They
hauled everything up four flights of stairs and a steep metal
ladder to the roof of their apartment house in Boerum Hill, to
create a garden that is overflowing with cherry tomatoes, bell and
jalapeno peppers, basil and onions.
</P>
<P>
   They also had to carry up daily supplies of water until they
purchased a hose, which now snakes through the kitchen window and
up to the roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went a little overboard,'' said Steiner, a computer expert
at Razorfish, a Web page design company.
</P>
<P>
   Swett, who is the campaign finance director for U.S. Rep.
Charles Rangel, a Harlem Democrat, added, ``We innocently bought a
little flat of tomatoes, not quite realizing we had so many or that
they would grow so huge.''
</P>
<P>
   So what do they do with all that basil? ``We have people over
for pesto,'' Swett said. ``It's a dream dinner party because it
only takes 10 minutes to make, and it's impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy and Michael Goldstein are just as eager to dazzle visitors
to their sophisticated, 2,500-square-foot rooftop garden on Broome
Street in Soho, which abounds in white peaches, cherries, grapes,
blackberries and a multitude of herbs. ``We're trying to grow
kiwis, without much success,'' Goldstein said, peering at a pair of
vines, which embrace a picturesque wooden archway. ``The female is
not doing as well as the male,'' he noted, ruefully.
</P>
<P>
   Other specimens are thriving. ``When we have friends for dinner,
we serve vanilla ice cream and invite them to pick their own
fruit,'' said Goldstein, president of Infomax Trading Corporation.
``When you tell people they can go over and get a peach, they get
very excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Some may be impressed by rooftop corn, but Goldstein is scornful
of those who would cultivate it in the city. ``I've grown it
myself, and it's a waste of time,'' he said. ``You end up with four
ears. Big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   He buys many of his seeds and plants thriftily at suburban
discount stores and gardening centers. He gets fertilizer at Price
Club in Wayne, N.J., (973) 812-1803, and his planters from
Sitecraft, a Long Island City company that makes roof decking and
planters to order, (718) 729-4900.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicious of the reliability of automatic watering systems,
Goldstein spends two hours a day watering his garden in the summer
months. ``If a drip system failed, I'd lose a tree,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As they fed each other succulent berries in their urban Eden,
the couple, who have been married for 20 years, said they shared
the credit for the fruits of their labors. ``I plant, she edits,''
Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   With the shade from their own fruit trees and a rooftop pool,
the couple seldom flee the city during the summer. ``It's Friday
night and everybody's heading for the Hamptons,'' Goldstein said,
savoring a blueberry. ``And I'm laughing.''

<P>
   Old MacDonald Had a Penthouse: Tips for Rooftop Farmers &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Call it shoehorn gardening. Rooftop farmers without the luxury
of big spaces can mix it up in containers, Jon Carloftis advises.
He planted Barbara Schwartz's corn in with cabbages, string beans,
tomatoes, strawberries and sweet potatoes, whose vines cascade
luxuriantly. Marigolds planted between vegetables help control
pests. Carloftis fertilizes every two weeks with an all-purpose
20-20-20 fertilizer: ``The water system leaches out the nutrients
each day, and it's also very intensive gardening, with multiple
plantings that deplete the soil.''
</P>
<P>
   The growing medium is a lightweight mixture of peat moss,
perlite, vermiculite and dehydrated cow manure, with a little
bagged topsoil.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schwartz grows smoke trees and weeping pines; cosmos,
zinnias, dahlias and daisies, and fennel and pineapple mint, which
are herbs with beautiful flowers. Containers should be three inches
off the ground for drainage.
</P>
<P>
   A class in rooftop and terrace design will be given by the
Horticultural Society of New York, 128 W. 58th St., on Sept. 15, at
6:30 p.m. The cost is $28. Information: (212) 757-0915.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Looking back on her meteoric movie career, Luise
Rainer said, ``I should have done more. I did too little of
everything.'' As she spoke, she sighed deeply with regret that was
almost tangible.
</P>
<P>
   In Hollywood, where rising and falling stars are a fact of life,
Ms. Rainer has one of the most improbable histories. In the late
1930s, she was Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's latest European discovery. A
Viennese stage actress who had appeared in plays by Pirandello and
Wedekind in Austria and Germany, she was whisked off to Hollywood,
where she made three movies in 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of moviegoers and to the amazement of Louis B.
Mayer, the head of the studio, she won back-to-back Academy Awards
as best actress for her second and third films, ``The Great
Ziegfeld'' in 1936 and ``The Good Earth'' in 1937. As a double
winner, she beat out, among others, Norma Shearer, Carole Lombard
and Greta Garbo.
</P>
<P>
   One might have expected her to go on to continuing stardom, as
did her rivals. Instead she was mishandled by Mayer and made to act
in five forgettable films for MGM. In 1938, after three years, she
broke her contract and left Hollywood, returning briefly in 1943 to
make a film for Paramount. She remembers Mayer's parting threat:
``We made you and we can kill you.'' Her response: ``Mr. Mayer, you
didn't make me. God made me.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, Ms. Rainer acted in a few plays and did some
television but has lived her life far away from the movies.
Finally, after an absence of 55 years, she is back on screen, in a
featured role in ``The Gambler,'' a film from Hungarian director
Karoly Makk that stars Michael Gambon as Fyodor Dostoyevsky. She
plays a flamboyant Russian dowager who suddenly develops a craving
for the roulette table. In New York for the movie's recent opening
at the Film Forum, the actress visited from her home in London and
was interviewed in the lounge of her Manhattan hotel.
</P>
<P>
   At 89, she is as petite as she was in the 1930s. As she was
quick to point out, she looks much younger than she does in makeup
in ``The Gambler.'' A review of the film in The New York Times
described her as having ``the magnetic presence of an ancient
grande dame with an elfin sense of mischief,'' and she vigorously
objected to the word ``ancient.'' ``What am I, an antiquity?'' she
asked. Then, with the vitality of a woman decades younger, she
talked about her life in Hollywood and later, and about her failed
marriage to playwright Clifford Odets.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled the old studio days when she was completely under
the control of Mayer and his company. ``They owned me completely,''
she said. ``I was a tool in a big mechanical factory.'' In her
first film, ``Escapade,'' she replaced Myrna Loy, who had decided
not to play the role of a governess (opposite William Powell). Then
Ms. Rainer was cast, again with Powell, in ``The Great Ziegfeld,''
a musical extravaganza about the life and Follies of the theatrical
impresario.
</P>
<P>
   She played Ziegfeld's first wife, the singer Anna Held. In a
bravura scene, she fought back tears as she telephoned Ziegfeld to
congratulate him on his second marriage (to Billie Burke).
Supposedly Mayer tried to cut the scene because the film was too
long. ``It was the first thing that fell on the cutting floor,''
she said. Happily, it was restored to the film and was apparently
the principal reason that she won the Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   Irving Thalberg, head of production at MGM, next chose her to
play O-lan, the saintly peasant wife in the screen adaptation of
Pearl S. Buck's novel ``The Good Earth.'' The casting was made over
the objections of Mayer, who thought she should continue to do
romantic roles.
</P>
<P>
   One evening, Ms. Rainer, the toast of Hollywood, was in the
Brown Derby with George Gershwin, Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg.
Odets, who was also at the height of his fame, came over to their
table. Ms. Rainer had no idea who he was, but there evidently was a
mutual attraction. They met again at a party at Dorothy Parker's
house. While Ms. Rainer was filming ``The Good Earth,'' with the
San Fernando Valley substituting for China, Odets telephoned her.
He took her out and a year later they were married.
</P>
<P>
   The glamorous couple honeymooned in Mexico, and on their wedding
night Odets followed his customary writing ritual: he stayed up all
night working on a screenplay. This was an omen of what was to come
in their often explosive marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if they had many arguments, she said: ``They were not even
arguments. He screamed at me and then didn't talk for a week. It
was very, very difficult, but Odets was a very special and
immensely gifted human being, and I loved him.'' Odets later wrote
in his journal, ``Luise Rainer was one of the several persons in my
life who prepared me for life. Our brief time together was
necessary for both of us.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Rainer said, ``It wasn't necessary. It went knee-deep
through sorrow _ and for my work it was bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Having played three diverse roles, she thought she had
demonstrated her versatility. ``Instead of saying, well the girl
can do everything, they said, she's so difficult to cast.'' There
were several roles that she coveted, including the leads in
``Madame Curie'' and ``For Whom the Bell Tolls,'' which went to
Greer Garson and Ingrid Bergman. Instead Mayer put her in ``The
Emperor's Candlesticks,'' again with Powell; ``The Big City'' with
Spencer Tracy and ``The Toy Wife'' with Melvyn Douglas (she has a
lingering fondness for that picture and co-star).
</P>
<P>
   With envy she contemplated the diverse career of a contemporary
actress like Meryl Streep. In contrast, Ms. Rainer feels that she
was a victim of the star system. ``It was pandemonium for me,'' she
said. ``I wanted to develop as an actress. That was my only
ambition.''
</P>
<P>
   There were, however, certain perks. As a member of Hollywood's
reigning royalty, she was given an apartment inside the MGM studio,
sharing a house with Shearer, Garbo and Joan Crawford. Perhaps
because of their European backgrounds, she seemed to have a special
affinity for Garbo. ``Garbo was so beautiful,'' she said. ``I
adored her. The camera went around her face and you saw that
profile. Garbo  &UR; was &LR; ; she didn't have to act.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With Odets, she once visited Albert Einstein, and the three of
them went rowing together on Long Island Sound. As Margaret Brenman
Gibson wrote in her biography of Odets, Einstein playfully pulled
Ms. Rainer's hair, an indication that he was attracted to her.
Remembering the incident, Ms. Rainer said she was so flustered that
``I nearly turned the boat over.''
</P>
<P>
   After her divorce, she made her Broadway debut in ``A Kiss for
Cinderella'' by James M. Barrie, and later toured in Maxwell
Anderson's ``Joan of Lorraine.'' In 1953, she married Robert
Knittel, an English publisher. They lived in Switzerland and
traveled the world. After her husband's death in 1989, she moved
back to London.
</P>
<P>
   To that frequently asked question of why she stopped making
films, she explained that it was a matter of chance, or
happenstance. She has never had an agent and there were few
opportunities, although occasionally she was courted by such
directors as Luchino Visconti and Federico Fellini.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, she said, she was all set to act in ``La Dolce
Vita,'' and had even written her own scene. But when Fellini told
her that she would be required to do a sexual scene, she objected.
She left Rome, she said, even though Fellini got down on his knees
in the middle of the Via Veneto and begged her to change her mind.
</P>
<P>
   The role in ``The Gambler'' came about through the intercession
of Roddy McDowall, whom she described as ``for many years my best
friend in Hollywood,'' a claim that could be made with equal
validity by countless other stars from Lillian Gish to Elizabeth
Taylor. He had heard about the film and suggested her for the part.
</P>
<P>
   She regards ``The Gambler'' as something of a lark: ``I had
great fun with it. People say, how did you feel after these years
of not doing anything?'' She said that she had never lost her
talent: ``It is all inside you.'' Her life without acting was, she
said, ``wonderful and difficult,'' difficult, she reiterated,
because she was not giving of herself.
</P>
<P>
   For some years, she has been working on her memoirs. ``I have
written 230 pages,'' she said, ``and you know old I am?
Twenty-two!'' She laughed and said that at that pace, the book
would be as long as ``War and Peace.'' Her title is ``Unfinished
Symphony.''
</P>
<P>
   She has one dream project, to make a movie based on a novel she
would not name, saying that she was fearful someone might steal it.
``It's a book about saving Venice and saving beauty, about not
making materialism the quintessence of existence. It has a
wonderful part for me, a grandmother, an old woman. She has a great
struggle with her family because she is an idealist.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about the novel and about her character, she said,
``You know, some very beautiful things get lost and forgotten.''
She added, ``Just as I got lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Warming to the conversation, she said, ``Ask more.''
</P>
<P>
   Does she ever watch her old movies? She has copies, she said,
but _ unlike Norma Desmond _ she never looks at them.
</P>
<P>
   If her phone rang today with a movie offer, what would she do?
``It won't,'' she said, ``but if it did and if the script were
good, I would do it  &UR; immediately &LR; .''

REORGANIZATION OF NUCLEAR LABS THREATENS DEFENSE BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Wednesday he
will probably ask President Clinton to veto the $289 billion
defense bill because it would take away much of his control over
U.S. nuclear labs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would most likely recommend to the president that he veto
the bill,'' Richardson told reporters. Congress is expected to send
the bill to the president shortly after Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate conferees agreed last week to include
provisions in the defense bill for the creation of a separately
administered agency inside the Energy Department to tighten
security at laboratories and plants that design, build and maintain
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization plan is in response to allegations that China
stole some of the most sensitive U.S. nuclear secrets because of
lax security at weapons laboratories administered by the Energy
Department.
</P>
<P>
   To be called the National Nuclear Security Administration, the
new agency would be managed by an undersecretary of energy, with
broad authority over policy, budgeting, security and
counterintelligence for the nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   The energy secretary would have no direct authority over the new
agency's employees. The secretary could exercise control through
the agency's director, who would report to Richardson. The
legislation doesn't allow the secretary to ``fire, hire or directly
order'' employees of the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said the changes _ which would be the most dramatic
restructuring of the Energy Department since it was formed in 1977
_ would eliminate tangles in the lines of authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, you have all of these problems at the labs, and no
one seems to be responsible,'' said Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas,
who helped author the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   He said the new agency would replace what he called ``a
dysfunctional bureaucracy'' with a military-like chain of command
from the secretary through the new agency's director to field
directors of weapons labs such as Lawrence Livermore in Livermore,
Calif., and Los Alamos and Sandia in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson complained Wednesday that the agreement ``undermines
his authority'' to run the Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to be in charge when a part of your department
has its own apparatus and can hire anybody it wants,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said he was willing to accept a ``semiautonomous
agency'' within his department so long as he retained control over
all of the agency's personnel and operations.
</P>
<P>
   The White House had no comment on whether Clinton would veto the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary said he has made these changes in response to the
allegations of Chinese espionage:
</P>
<P>
   _ Requiring scientists working on nuclear weapons to take
polygraph tests;
</P>
<P>
   _ Installing software to prevent outside computers from breaking
into classified lab systems and stealing information;
</P>
<P>
   _ Requiring lab workers to get the approval of a superior before
moving any classified materials to unclassified computers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Increasing the department's counterintelligence budget from
$2.4 million in 1997 to more than $40 million now.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson also said he will announce within days disciplinary
action against individuals stemming from the mishandling of the
espionage investigation at the Los Alamos weapons laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Wen Ho Lee, a scientist who was fired from the Los Alamos lab
for security violations, has been questioned by the FBI about the
possible theft of nuclear secrets by China. Lee has denied that he
divulged atomic secrets to China or ``any unauthorized person.''

IT'S THE DAWNING OF THE AGE OF OPHIUCHUS
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ What's the story behind Ophiuchus, the 13th zodiac
sign? _ D.P., Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ Ophiuchus appears in a zodiac chart based on the sun's
actual position in relation to the constellations.
</P>
<P>
   As the Earth rotates, it wobbles like a top in a loop that takes
26,000 years to complete. The original zodiac, mapped out around
2,000 years ago, is about a month off because of this wobble.
</P>
<P>
   The modified zodiac used the actual time the sun spends in each
constellation. Ophiuchus, also called the Serpent Bearer, is
included because it lies with the other 12 constellations in the
sun's path.
</P>
<P>
   The revised zodiac:
</P>
<P>
   Pisces: March 12-April 18; Aries: April 19-May 13, Taurus: May
14-June 19; Gemini: June 20-July 20; Cancer: July 21-Aug. 9, Leo:
Aug. 10-Sept. 15- Virgo: Sept. 16-Oct. 30; Libra: Oct. 31-Nov. 22;
Scorpius: Nov. 23-Nov. 29; Ophiuchus: Nov. 30-Dec. 17; Sagittarius:
Dec. 18-Jan. 18; Capricornus: Jan. 19-Feb. 15; and Aquarius: Feb.
16-March 11.
</P>
<P>
   This zodiac is most popular with astronomers poking fun at
astrology. ``The fact that astrologers use a system 2,000 years out
of date to draw up horoscopes, but then tell us, for example, that
a particular planet entering a certain sign is full of meaning,
shows how it is all nonsense,'' astronomer Jacqueline Mitton wrote
for the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ What year did the Pittsburgh Steelers and Philadelphia
Eagles play together as a single team? _ A.A.P., Fort Worth, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ The Steelers and Eagles merged for a single season in
1943, pooling their resources because so many players were either
serving in World War II or working in war-related industries.
</P>
<P>
   The team played as Phil-Pitt that year, although fans called
them the ``Steagles.'' Their schedule of home games was split
between the two cities, and Earle ``Greasy'' Neale of Philadelphia
and Walt Kiesling of Pittsburgh shared the coaching duties. They
finished 5-4-1.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the Steelers merged with the Chicago Cardinals for
a season and were coached by Kiesling and Phil Handler of Chicago.
They played as Card-Pitt and were the worst NFL team of all time,
according to ``Washington Times'' writer Dan Daly.
</P>
<P>
   During the course of a season in which they lost all 10 games
they played, the team was derisively nicknamed the ``Carpets.''
After one loss, the owners fined three players $200 each for
``inept playing.'' Daly wrote, ``How, you wonder, did they ever
narrow it down to three inept players?''  &QL;

   ``Qur'an and Woman: Rereading the Sacred Text From a Woman's
Perspective''
</P>
<P>
   By Amina Wadud
</P>
<P>
   Oxford University Press, $112E95
</P>
<P>
   One of the cornerstones of Islam is something called exegesis,
or the interpretation of words and passages from the Koran (or
Qur'an as it is sometimes spelled)2E For 14 centuries, however,
these readings have been exclusively dominated by male
theologians2E It has been suggested that these approaches have kept
Muslim women oppressed in ways that the religion never intended2E
In fact, author Amina Wadud argues, Islam's scriptures have been
manipulated to justify violence against women2E
</P>
<P>
   If the reader is looking for a critical study of how women are
treated, or mistreated, in some Muslim societies, this is not the
book2E Wadud, an American convert who is a professor of Islamic
studies at Virginia Commonwealth University, says her goal was to
show that the Qur'an does not relegate women to an inferior role2E
</P>
<P>
   In fact, women should be afforded the highest respect and
protection because they are child-bearers and the primary
nurturers, according to her interpretation2E When the Koran says,
``O wives of the Prophet 2E2E2E stay quietly in your houses and
make not a wanton display,'' this is not meant to restrict women's
freedom of movement, as such fundamentalist regimes as
Afghanistan's Taliban interpret it2E Rather, Wadud insists, it is
aimed at discouraging women from making a salacious spectacle of
themselves in public2E
</P>
<P>
   ``Qur'an and Woman'' provides a provocative and fresh look at
Islam that challenges the stereotypes2E

</P>
<P>
   Gospel rap is certainly not new, but the Gospel Gangstaz have
taken it to a new level of popularity: Their debut on California's
B-Rite has vaulted to No. 3 on the ``Billboard'' Top Gospel Albums
chart, right behind T.D. Jakes and Kirk Franklin.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal is obvious: The trio of Chille' Baby, Tik Tokk and
leader Mr. Solo makes streetwise hip-hop that fuses convincing rap
and sweet vocal harmonies.
</P>
<P>
   The music compares favorably with that of secular hip-hop
artists in sound quality, songwriting and the various vocal styles
of the three members, who began performing together in 1989 and had
previously released two CDs on the small Holy Terra label.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there's still a lot of the sort of boasting that hamstrings
many hip-hop CDs _ check out ``One Way'' _ but more often, the
group does a commendable job of turning the tables on the genre.
Although so many other artists rap about making money and having
unlimited sex, the Gangstaz are all about leaving that sort of
lifestyle behind to find a new path.

   IDYLLWILD, Calif. _ The poet, famously quiet in the face of the
noise of life, is used to finding sustenance, even inspiration, in
silence, but as I discovered on my first day of poetry camp, there
is poetic silence, and then there is the other kind.
</P>
<P>
   We were just getting acquainted, my poet classmates and I, on a
brilliant morning in this mountain resort a mile above the desert
near Los Angeles, gingerly offering supportive comments as each
participant read aloud the first in-class assignment, a sort of
free-association piece about our early memories of speech.
</P>
<P>
   I was happy not to go first, and delighted when an elementary
school teacher who read a poem unrelated to the theme still drew
smiling responses. But all the hesitation I'd brought to this
experiment in personal reinvention returned when an older woman, a
children's book author, read a touching, well-shaped poem about
helping her grandmother with a crossword puzzle as a child. It was
thoughtful and, worst of all, confident.
</P>
<P>
   When my turn arrived, I steeled myself and was reminded why
middle-aged journalists so rarely attempt this sort of psychic
bungee jumping. For years I have written newspaper articles read by
a million people a day, but I had never felt so, well, naked,
holding a legal pad and preparing to read a few lines of verse
about, of all things, myself.
</P>
<P>
   I declaimed what I imagined to be a rhapsodic if rambling poem,
composed in 10 minutes or so, comparing my earliest search for
words with recollections of my daughter's first utterances. Not
exactly the T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound I had studied in graduate
school, I thought, but not an unworthy notion. Then I looked up and
met the stares, and silence, of my 11 classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone want to comment?'' the teacher, Cecilia Woloch, a
nimble, gentle poet, eventually asked. She has taught everywhere,
from a prison to elementary schools. After a painful pause, she
filled the vacuum with a few words, noting how novel were my
descriptions of smearing peanut butter across my face as a toddler
and of using the knob of a toy cabinet as a telephone receiver.
More silence.
</P>
<P>
   It was both humbling and, once the shock wore off, invigorating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this was really, really hard,'' one of my
classmates, an author of adventure books for children, said a
couple of days later after reading an unflinchingly personal poem
in which she artfully wrote about her mother as a glacier.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Woloch replied, ``It's supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   We were, in fact, part of a quietly expanding trend in the
country, ordinary people seizing the notion that they have
something important to say through prose or poetry and paying good
money to shape their voices. My colleagues included a middle-aged
physician who had never done serious writing, a handwriting
analyst, a Silicon Valley computer engineer, a real estate broker,
a water utility worker and a music editor.
</P>
<P>
   (The Idyllwild program cost $295 for three days of workshops,
lectures and readings and an additional $175 for a private room in
the dormitories and meals in the cafeteria, relatively cheap by
workshop standards.)
</P>
<P>
   The program avoided any deep exploration of traditional meter or
poetic forms, although one section used haiku and tanka in its
exercises, but neither did it merely encourage undisciplined and
emotive doodlings. There were both in-class and overnight writing
exercises, based on specific sets of random words or ideas. Our
poems grew increasingly personal and careful in their use of
language as the week progressed, and we analyzed the writing
closely for both content and style.
</P>
<P>
   David Fenza, the executive director of a trade organization
called Associated Writing Programs, said that the number of
degree-granting programs in creative writing had grown from 13
three decades ago to slightly more than 300 today. And he said the
number of qualified summer writing workshops has leaped from a
minuscule few to almost 100 registered with his group.
</P>
<P>
   The conferences are often in resort communities, like Key West,
Fla.; Provincetown, Mass.; Sun Valley, Idaho, and Taos, N.M., which
can make them seem little more than slightly cerebral vacations.
But the deeply emotional character of the writing and the pithy
quality of the poems written by the Idyllwild group suggested that
more was at work.
</P>
<P>
   One woman wrote of teaching Emily Dickinson the domestic art of
folding a baby's laundry, only to have the famous poet discover
that gently tucking together socks was not unlike composing one of
her poems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing various kinds of workshops for years, and
there are always wonderful surprises,'' said Ms. Woloch, who would
offer, ``I think you caught a fish'' when a student read a winner
to the class.
</P>
<P>
   John Brandi, a poet from New Mexico who taught another section
of the workshop, said: ``People get down to this. They write
poetry. It's a brave thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The depth of interest was evident at Idyllwild, a pretty town of
cabins and small inns 110 miles southeast of Los Angeles in the San
Jacinto Mountains, the home of a music and arts boarding school
during the year. There has been a summer arts program here for 50
years, and about 1,200 people now take courses or workshops.
</P>
<P>
   This year the nonprofit organization that runs the site, the
Idyllwild Arts Foundation, offered a poetry workshop for the first
time. Not only were the three-day workshops filled almost instantly
when the brochures were first sent out months ago, but the
foundation also added a second section in each session and expanded
the number of slots to about a dozen per class, from an anticipated
10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of what drives the summer programs is what drives the
whole economy, aging boomers,'' Fenza said. ``The kids are out of
the house, people are divorced, people are reinventing themselves.
For some it's a spiritual crisis. For some it's the start of a real
commitment to a different way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   My own poems did improve considerably from the peanut
butter-smeared face of the first day, even if they did not ascend
the emotional summits. Perhaps most satisfying was an exercise in
which I had to use both Muhammad Ali and cooking in a poem. I
turned it into a lesson, in which the whimsical and inventive boxer
taught me how to cook for my children, persuading me in the process
that although I had believed I cooked quite well and that my
children were well fed, they were, in fact, hungry _ a verse, of
course, about my metaphorical efforts to refresh my use of
language. Well, it was a start.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Karman, the music editor who was my classmate, had turned
the trip into a family experience. His wife took a painting class,
and his teenage son was studying electric bass. He said he felt he
had almost no facility with words and was awkward in the first
exercises without anything very clear to say.
</P>
<P>
   But on our final morning he suddenly blurted out that right then
and there he had written a poem and was eager to read it. It was a
jazzlike verse about his father, as a philandering hipster in a
two-seat sports car, and the impression he had made on the child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you caught a fish,'' Ms. Woloch said.

   New E-Gadgets, Dressed Like iMacs
</P>
<P>
   If you are one of those PC users who is green with envy over the
iMac's teal shell, don't fret. Marketing experts around the world
are not about to miss the Bondi Blue wave.
</P>
<P>
   One example is the E-Power, a PC that looks remarkably like the
iMac, with a curved monitor, translucent blue sides and curved
grips on the top for portability. The computer comes with Windows
software, built-in speakers, a 15-inch monitor, a Celeron chip with
speeds up to 500 megahertz, a 56K modem and a CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   Future Power, the American company that plans to sell the
computers in September for $799 each, says that it did not copy
Apple's design. The company's designers chose to create the
E-Power, said Priscilla Lynn, Future Power's marketing manager,
``because of the trend in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   But the people at Apple think that such a defense is, well,
transparent. They are suing Future Power for copying their design.
</P>
<P>
   Other gadget makers are wrapping everything they can _ including
keyboards, mice, scanners and modems _ in translucent plastic. A
Japanese company called Audio-Technica has created iHear2, headsets
molded in see-through clear and blue plastic.
</P>
<P>
   And new models of the Rio Player, a portable MP3 player
developed by Rioport, will be available later this year in silver,
teal and what the company unabashedly calls ``iMac grape.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to emulate Apple,'' said Todd Moore, director of
platform development for Rioport. ``We wanted to utilize the same
success and connect ourselves to their community.''
</P>
<P>
   Stan Flack, publisher and editor in chief of a news site called
Mac Central Online, said he had seen toasters, cell phones and even
shavers with the same packaging. ``You have to give credit where
credit is due, to Apple,'' Flack said. ``They really have started a
trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Apple flattered? ``The response is pretty remarkable, isn't
it?'' said Jonathan Ive, Apple's vice president for industrial
design. ``We're seeing some examples of good designs, and some
examples of pretty awful designs.''

   If You've Always Wanted to Go to Harvard ...
</P>
<P>
   Now you can walk the hallowed halls of academe on the Internet
or revisit the site of a particularly embarrassing Frosh Week
episode.
</P>
<P>
   The Campus Tours site (www.campustours.com) has collected many
of the interactive digital tours that college and university
campuses put on line to lure prospective students.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Duke University displays its elegant Durham, N.C.,
campus through 360-degree panoramas, at www.duke.edu/web/duketour.
Harvard University provides a virtual tour through lecture halls
and dorm rooms at www.news.harvard.edu/tour.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Quan, who does online production for some universities,
noted that the elaborate tours connect not only with future
students but also with another critical university audience:
alumni, who can be gently prodded to make generous donations after
they explore some old haunts.

   Improv Animation's Software Takes Cartoons to New Level
</P>
<P>
   Jar Jar Binks aside, it seems only a matter of time before film
actors themselves are replaced by pixels. Making that even easier
is Improv Technologies, a software company that develops high-end
production applications for use in the film, television, multimedia
and computer game industries. Its Improv Animation System software
took center stage at the Siggraph '99 computer-graphics conference
in Los Angeles this week.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the methods used to produce labor-intensive animated
wonders like Disney's ``Toy Story,'' Improv's software interacts
with other animation programs and lets the artist create libraries
of character movements. These sequences can be reused, blended and
combined with fresh material to create fluid motion that can be
``directed'' by the animator, much as a director directs a real
actor.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Using the Improv Animation System _ based on technology
developed at New York University _ the animator Mitch Butler
programmed one of his artificial actors, Leon Gerald, to address
the audience at Siggraph. With the library of movements and
reactions, Leon could interact with the crowd with his creator
animating him on the fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' Butler said of the Improv software. ``It allows
me to reuse animation in different ways.''
</P>
<P>
   With beta versions to be released this fall, the Improv product
designed for professional animators will be released early next
year. The company also hopes to release a Web-based version for the
home market of aspiring Tex Averys. &QL;

   X10's DVD Anywhere Helps Cut Wire Problem
</P>
<P>
   Once you attached your new PC-based DVD player to your
television, your first reaction might not have been ``What a great
picture'' but ``Great _ another wire to trip over.''
</P>
<P>
   One solution comes in the form of X10's new DVD Anywhere, a
wireless transmitter, receiver and universal remote controller in a
bundle.
</P>
<P>
   Once attached to a user's television and a PC's DVD-ROM drive,
the $88 device promises to beam, via 2.4-gigahertz radio waves,
high-quality DVD images and stereo sound from the PC to the
television. The obvious drawback to watching DVD films on computer
monitors has been their relatively small screens.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Denenholz, a spokesman for X10 (x10.com), the Web site that
sells the Seattle-based X10 products, said the computer's DVD drive
must have a video-out or RCA port so the device can be attached to
it. Alternatively, a video card, which is not included in the DVD
Anywhere kit, may be added to the computer.
</P>
<P>
   DVD Anywhere, however, does not live up to its name. Its range
is limited to 100 feet. &QL;

   OPERA GUIDE For the price of a couple of balcony seats, the fat
lady need not ever stop singing. The New Grove Dictionary of Opera
on line (www.groveopera.com) features full-text searches of more
than 11,000 articles, detailed essays on more than 1,800 operas and
external links to performers and opera houses, all of which will be
updated every six months. Individual subscriptions cost $150 for 12
months and are discounted if ordered with a copy of the book.

   INCOMING It's hardly news that Caller ID is becoming a popular
feature. What is more surprising is that unlike such other
ascendant technologies as cell phones and pagers, Caller ID is
popular across different income levels, according to a new survey
by Arbitron. The survey found that 40 percent of consumers in
households with incomes above $75,000 have Caller ID. The figure
for consumers in households with incomes under $25,000 is 39
percent.

<P>
   Hacker-Hunter Software to Use On Office or Home Computers
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is a two-way street. Even as one lane is used for
browsing the Web and sending e-mail using a modem, the other is a
route for hackers to invade home and office computers.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, only companies with deep pockets could afford the
large price tag of anti-hacker software _ but the growth of small
companies and home users has meant a growth in susceptible systems.
Black Ice, a new anti-hacker system from San Mateo-based Network
Ice, sells for around $37 per computer, a price that is affordable
for small- and medium-sized businesses, as well as home users. Home
and business versions of the software can be downloaded at the
company's Web site at www.networkice.com.
</P>
<P>
   While the hacker is attacking a computer, Black Ice can
automatically trace the hacker back to the source and display the
information to the computer user. In comparison, traditional hunts
for hackers, because of a quirk in the Internet protocol, require
manual searches through computer log records once the hacker is
long gone.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, networks dedicate one computer to watch all the
incoming data for all the computers. However, dedicated computers
cannot go out and hunt for culprits. Black Ice breaks up the system
by having each computer monitor itself, which allows it
simultaneously to trace perpetrators.

SIDEKICK PLANS TO LEAVE `LATE NIGHT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andy Richter, the affable and inscrutably funny sidekick to
Conan O'Brien on NBC's increasingly successful ``Late Night,'' will
leave the show next spring, he and O'Brien said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Richter said he felt the time was right for him to make an
effort to stake out his own career as an individual performer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening here is the regular old entrepreneurial
urge,'' he said. ``I sort of need to take this step for my own
peace of mind and my own sense of self-worth.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien announced the move at the end of Wednesday night's
edition of ``Late Night.'' The plan is for Richter to stay on
through next May, completing what will be his seventh year on the
show. The team defied early negative reaction to become a model for
a new generation of late-night host-sidekick combinations.
</P>
<P>
   Richter's decision was by every account amicable. O'Brien said:
``It's very tough on both a personal level and a professional
level. He's such a talented guy. But I just want Andy to be
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Richter said: ``Our relationship is pretty good. We spend so
much time together at the show, people always ask if we hang out
together after the show. And we do occasionally. But if we spent
more time together, I think it might start to get a little sick. My
wife might start to wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said he, Richter and the show's executive producer, Jeff
Ross, had known for some time that Richter would leave soon. ``I
think Andy came to me last March and mentioned it for the first
time,'' O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that they had all made the decision to announce the
plan now to make it easier for Richter to pursue his next career
step without stirring up rumors about why he was seeking other
work.
</P>
<P>
   As for finding a replacement, Ross said Richter had been such an
integal part of the success of ``Late Night'' that it would be
impossible to think of merely getting someone else to do the same
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be insulting to Andy to go out and find
somebody else to do what he's done,'' Ross said. ``We're not going
to find another Andy Richter, and we know it.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said that the show simply did not know what it would do,
but that ``whatever happens, Andy is not going to leave on a Friday
and then we have somebody sitting in his chair the next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men said it was likely that ``Late Night'' would use the
next six months to develop ideas about what direction to take after
Richter. ``I think it just has to happen organically,'' Ross said.
``That's pretty much the way everything happens around the show.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said: ``We have to deal with the challenge of how does
the show change. It's a challenge I take very seriously. But as
much as I like to coast, I think change can be a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, O'Brien said, it is likely that the show will
have to retire the well-established comedy routines that feature
Richter, some of which are among the most popular the show has
done.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are the goofy flashlight-lit ``Year 2000''
predictions that O'Brien and Richter made together and, perhaps
most memorably, their staring contests. ``I think we made our own
chemistry on the staring contests,'' O'Brien said. ``I can't see
doing that with anyone else. I guess on Andy's last show we'll do a
final staring contest.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Richter said, ``I'd have to say I would hate to
see them do some of those bits with anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Giving up what amounts to a guaranteed show business job with
exceptional exposure is certainly not common in television, as
Richter, 32, acknowledged. ``I absolutely know this is a risk. I'm
getting as comfortable as I can with the notion of giving up a
steady income.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``It's not like I went to bed as a boy dreaming of
being a sidekick on a late-night television show.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead he dreamed of being a comedy actor. That is what he had
started to be in Los Angeles before being recruited for ``Late
Night'' and what he intends to pursue when he leaves it. ``My goal
in life is to be Ned Beatty,'' Richter said. ``I want to a comedy
character actor.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, he said, he intends to begin pitching ideas for
his own prime-time comedy series. ``Whatever I do is probably going
to be something in television,'' Richter said.
</P>
<P>
   Richter more or less fell into the sidekick job after he was
hired as one of ``Late Night's'' first writers. In early
discussions around the office with O'Brien, he and the show's
original head writer, Robert Smigel, noticed how well the two men
played off each other.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien himself was then so inexperienced as a performer that it
seemed like a sound idea to give him someone to bounce comments
off. Although the show went though some well-publicized early
struggles _ and some NBC executives were especially keen to drop
Richter in the first season _ O'Brien quickly came to realize that
one of the show's strengths was his interaction with Richter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do work best as a reactor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richter said: ``We work well together because we run at
different speeds. Conan runs at a much higher rpm than I do. We
balance each other out. And we both have a profound reverence for
silliness.''

 TRAVELING BABY BOOMERS DRIVE RV SALES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CAROLYN FARR SMITH   
 Herald-Journal, Spartanburg, S.C.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREER, S.C. _ For years, recreational vehicles have been
stereotyped as being something for the ``over 55'' crowd, but times
are changing, according to market experts.
</P>
<P>
   RV sales are experiencing a 20-year high because more baby
boomers are entering the picture.
</P>
<P>
   About 45 percent of RV owners are between the ages of 35 and 54,
according a 1997 study conducted by the University of Michigan
Survey Research Center for the Recreational Vehicle Industry
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Baby boomers are remembering family camping trips as children
and buying into the experience today, said Hardee McAlhaney,
president and CEO of Holiday RV Super Stores in Greer. In the early
1970s, McAlhaney said, the market was strong because RVs were less
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the number of RV buyers started to decrease, but
now the RV craze is boosting sales once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an exciting time to be an RV dealer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Beddow, spokesman for the Recreation Vehicle Industry
Association, said the surge in younger buyers has been phenomenal,
pushing 1998 sales to a high of 297,000 units last year. The
Michigan study reflects that one out of 10 vehicle-owning
households owns an RV as well. In homes with the head of the
household ranging in age of 35 to 54, that number jumps to one in
nine households, Beddow said.
</P>
<P>
   The study also shows that buyers are closely divided among
empty-nesters age 55 and up who enjoy the freedom of travel and
35-to 54-year-olds who are raising families but enjoy the
convenience of RV vacations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last few years, there has been a growing awareness in
recreational vehicle usage,'' Beddow said. ``Some dealers are
allowing for rentals. If they try it and like it, they come back
and buy them.''
</P>
<P>
   Younger people are entering the market because they are seeking
convenience, affordability and comfort, he said. With an increased
choice in amenities and floor plans, anything is possible when it
comes to an RV.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers can select from travel trailers, pop-ups and motorhomes
with options such as oak cabinets, special siding and fancy
upholstery. Amenities include microwaves, stoves, satellite
television, hydraulic-leveling jacks, dishwashers, washer/dryer
combos, on-board computers and rear-vision backup cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Prices range from an average of $5,300 for a folding camping
trailer, also known as a pop-up, to $81,000 and up for the most
luxurious of the motorized RVs _ the virtual
``home-away-from-home'' on wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Just like in the car industry, there are all makes and models.
Popular selections include Pace Arrow, Damon, Terry, Coleman,
Allegro Bay, Salem and Carri Lite.
</P>
<P>
   ``RVs are for more than just camping,'' said Dan Wensell, an RV
consultant at Sonny's Camp N Travel in Spartanburg. ``They are
multifaceted. You can use them while tailgating at football games,
for infield seats at the race tracks, or for travel with large
groups of people.''
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't stop there. Poole said he has had customers come
to Holiday looking at an RV to use as a traveling office. Another
he said had the company remove the bedroom and install cage
materials for dog kennels for transporting to dog shows.
</P>
<P>
   Those who invest in a mobile home for vacation use want
something that is comfortable. With the increasing costs of hotel
rooms, Poole said customers are investing in their own ``home away
from home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Campsites are much cheaper than the hotels,'' Poole said.
``You pull in, you plug everything up, and you're set for a week at
the beach or in the mountains. You have everything you need right
inside from stove top, refrigerator and even a combo washer-dryer,
if you would like.''
</P>
<P>
   Buyers are encouraged to spend time in their selections before
they buy. Floor plans are important and consumers should
investigate every aspect, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
   Slide-out rooms are the biggest trend in the market, according
to both Wensell and Poole. A slide-out is a part of the trailer or
motorhome that extends outward once the vehicle has parked. In some
cases it provides more walking space in bedrooms, a larger nook for
the dinette booth, or more room in the living area.
</P>
<P>
   It all comes down to cost and the customers' idea of what makes
their motorized home a home.

DANCING IN A NEW FORM, FROM PAGE TO PAGE IN CHILDREN'S BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remy Charlip is an enduring figure in American modern dance, a
longtime performer and a choreographer with a gift for quirkily
evoking intense emotions with ordinary movement and a few vivid
props. For many, however, Charlip is best known as the writer and
illustrator of children's books.
</P>
<P>
   His 29 books, which include the new ``Peanut Butter Party'' and
``Sleepytime Rhyme,'' have been the subject of programs and
exhibitions at the Library of Congress, the Barnsdall Art Park in
Los Angeles and the San Francisco Public Library, where ``Remy
Charlip's World: Books Into Theater/Theater Into Books'' opens on
Oct. 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peanut Butter Party,'' an antic survey of the history and uses
of that sticky staple of children's lunches, was published this
spring by Tricycle Press. Greenwillow Books has just published his
``Sleepy Time Rhyme,'' a simple lullaby, designed to be read aloud,
that is a loving, gently fanciful celebration of a child's body.
And two of his books have recently been reissued, one of them his
signature ``Arm in Arm'' (Tricycle Press), and the other ``I Love
You'' (Scholastic).
</P>
<P>
   Charlip, who is 70 and lives in San Francisco, sees no
contradiction between his careers as a writer and illustrator and
as a performer with troupes that included the Merce Cunningham
Dance Company in the 1950s and early '60s. He is still performing
and choreographing. For him, there are powerful connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``A picture book is a series of pages sewn together on one side,
so that if you turn a page, it changes all that has gone before,''
Charlip said. ``I relish mediums that allow transformation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started as a painter, but soon began to be fascinated with
art forms in which sequence, transition and continuity were
possible: movies, comic strips, flip books, picture books, dances
and theater pieces. The elements common to these art forms can be
interchangeable, such as how an idea or story can proceed from
beginning to middle to end, close-ups or long shots, general
lighting or spotlighting, and rhythm and phrasing.''
</P>
<P>
   A classic among his books, called ``Fortunately,'' is for him
``a rambunctious dance'' that tells the story of a boy named Ned
who fortunately is invited to party in Florida but unfortunately
lives in New York and must find a way to get there. ``It is a
flying, falling in space, diving in water, swimming, running,
digging himself in and out of a cave and into a ballroom dance,''
Charlip said.
</P>
<P>
   His stage dances tend to have the books' simplicity, tenderness
and wit. And the inspirations of the dances and books are not
unsimilar. Charlip trained as an artist at Cooper Union in New
York, graduating in 1949 with a degree in fine arts. He was soon
seduced by dance, which he had begun to see as an art student. ``I
thought dancers were free spirits,'' Charlip said wryly. ``Little
did I know how puritanical, tyrannical and mechanical they are.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1955 he began writing and illustrating children's books. ``I
had to support my addiction to dance,'' he recalled.
``Fortunately,'' which has been in print for 35 years, has been a
steady source of extra income. ``That book actually helps me to do
some dancing I wouldn't have been able to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately'' was drawn in part from old Jewish vaudeville
humor. His first book, ``Dress Up and Let's Have a Party,'' was
inspired by an editor's forgetting an appointment with him and
going out to have her hair done.
</P>
<P>
   His dances also start with fairly ordinary situations or
observations. One of Charlip's best-known pieces, a solo called
``Dance With Towel'' that he created for Barbara Roan, began when
he bought himself a beautiful red towel.
</P>
<P>
   ``In `Sleepy Time Rhyme,' the intimacy of a mother and child is
depicted in their close movement over 16 double-page spreads,'' he
said. ``As I painted it, I felt I was choreographing a simple duet,
with a slow entrance under a shining sun, moving into a more active
game-playing section of naming the body parts, ending in a calm
cuddle in a restful moonlit scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I get older, my dancing has moved from outward expression
in performance to what I call `internal dancing,' micro movements
along the spine and the containers of my body, the pelvis, ribs and
head,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Peanut Butter Party,'' he explained, ``there is a `quiet
time all by yourself party,' a meditation on emptying and filling,
an internal dance.''

   BAXTER-COLUMN _ DES MOINES _ As it was conceived just a few
election cycles ago, the modern-day political straw poll was a
harmless enough idea. State political parties are always trying to
raise money, and the competition among presidential candidates to
make an early showing was growing increasingly intense. Straw polls
_ rough, early headcounts to measure support among the party
faithful _ were a facet of political gatherings already.So why not
get the campaigns involved in drumming up interest and charge a few
bucks at the door for those who wanted to show their colors at the
state convention? National media interest in Saturday's Iowa
Republican straw poll is so keen there is scarcely a rental car to
be found in the area, and precious few hotel rooms. (Baxter,

   BRITAIN-ECLIPSE _ FALMOUTH, England _ Within five minutes, night
fell and day broke. At 11:11 a.m. (6:11 a.m. Eastern Time) the
broad bowl of the ancient harbor here fell nearly dark, looking
like some giant stadium lit only by the flashes of a thousand
cameras. As the moon passed in front of the sun, the chilly drizzle
off the Atlantic paused. The sea birds fell silent, giving way to
the lonely drone of a helicopter overhead. In a town across the
way, orange streetlights tried to flicker to life, while twinkling
lights came on aboard the vessels assembled on the water below. The
gloom was broken by the brief and reassuring sparkle and boom of
fireworks. This short time in the Path of Totality _ it lasted just
over two minutes _ seemed to cast a spell over many of the hundreds
gathered at Pendennis Castle, the stony hilltop fortification
commissioned by King Henry VIII here on the southwest tip of
England. Developing. (Roughton, Cox News Service). 20.

   PLAIN AN GWARRY, England _ Despite the best efforts of Druids
who had performed sun dances barefoot among magic stones for the
past several days, rain clouds, so often the spoiler of England's
summer, eclipsed the eclipse here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At 11 minutes past 11 o'clock, the hundreds of thousands of
people who journeyed here to the Duchy of Cornwall breathlessly
waiting in the darkened morning to see the last total eclipse of
the sun during this millennium saw little more than dark rain
clouds under a sky that got, well, darker.
</P>
<P>
   And the residents of Cornwall, one of the poorest English
counties, where much of the land is owned by Prince Charles, were
left with nothing to do but grumble over their pasties about an
event that was supposed to benefit the local economy and instead
left vacancy signs hanging from hotels and campsites.
</P>
<P>
   Scare stories about traffic congestion, health concerns and lack
of food and water kept paying customers away. The cosmic event
instead attracted a throng of New Age Travelers, pagans, druids and
solar worshippers who offered little in the way of money and were
left groping for meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels freaky,'' Lucie Mortimer, a Coca-Cola Co.
representative, said during the brief darkness that enveloped the
countryside. ``It's like God left to go to the toilet for two
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people here staring into the sky directly in the path of
the 70-mile wide track of totality, the complete blotting out of
the sun by the moon, had to face the fact that the weather
forecasters were actually right this time.
</P>
<P>
   In typical British understatement, Michael Heys, who had driven
800 miles from the north of Scotland with his wife and three boys,
said, ''This is a little disappointing.'' His wife, Sue, added: ''I
heard about the eclipse as a child and always wanted to go. But
missing it is OK.''
</P>
<P>
   This being the 1990s _ and another shot being unlikely because
the next total eclipse in Britain will not come until 2090 _ Teresa
Feton, 18, a student from Lancastershire, was prepared. She had
hedged her bets by setting her video recorder at home to tape the
event on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our British weather, but it didn't put me off coming
here,'' she said, huddling in her tent as the rain poured down.
</P>
<P>
   Many were still struck by the view they did have. ``It's like
one minute someone pulled the curtain down.'' said Brian Bennett, a
high school science teacher from Warwickshire. ``It's totally
bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the Moon interposed itself between the Sun and Earth
here for a little over two minutes, the shadow of the eclipse
whisked over the English Channel at 1,800 mph, beginning its
journey across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   There, millions of people shared mixed fortunes as areas
underneath the path of totality experienced varying weather
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In many parts of Europe where only a partial eclipse was
visible, but the weather was better, office workers stepped outside
for a brief glimpse.
</P>
<P>
   In London, where a 97 percent eclipse could be seen, some
commuters got off the Underground to see the view, just to get back
on and continue their journey.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, several hundred people popped open Champagne bottles
in front of the fashion designer Poco Rabanne's store to celebrate
the city's survival; Rabanne had predicted that the Russian space
station Mir would smash into Paris during the eclipse.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans, who had been hearing about the coming eclipse for
weeks through a relentless series of newspaper articles, radio and
television reports and plenty of commercial spinoffs, put special
viewing glasses on cats, dogs and horses.
</P>
<P>
   Even Pope John Paul II watched the eclipse through a darkened
lens at his summer residence in Castelgandolfo, south of Rome.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   However, even the celestial majesty of the moment could not help
undo the losses local businesses suffered from the lack of visitors
to the Cornish countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question the media and the local authorities
scared people off,'' said Claude Bennetts, who invested 150,000
pounds, or $242,000, in two campsites designed to accommodate
10,000 campers. Fewer than 500 showed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't have created a worse problem if you actually
tried,'' he said. ``It's happening all over Cornwall. It's not just
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen months ago the county hired Gage Williams, a retired
senior army officer, to oversee the logistics of the event, which
Williams predicted would bring 1.2 million people to Cornwall. Now
the local business community, in search of a scapegoat, is pointing
at Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a lot to answer for,'' said John Wells, a local mayor.
``He was a cannon ball that wasn't programmed right.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who could not be reached Wednesday for comment, told
The Cornish Guardian, ``Had we not highlighted the implications of
unprecedented numbers coming to the county for the eclipse, we
would not have galvanized those responsible into insuring that
there will be sufficient food, nor would we have implemented the
major improvements to the road network, which have now been put in
place and from which we will all benefit in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Traffic surveillance cameras, 250 extra police officers on
motorcycles and coast guards on horseback patrolling the cliffs and
beaches were part of the vast investment to monitor the hordes of
visitors expected to come by road and water. Supermarkets stocked
up with extra food and supplies and extended their hours to
accommodate.
</P>
<P>
   But just as the turnout failed to justify _ or repay _ all the
advance work, no amount of planning could guarantee good weather.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as a representative of the faithful, Edward Prynn, the
self-appointed Arch Druid of Cornwall, was surrendering no ground
to the weather or the weather forecasters: ``I had a vision last
night that it wasn't going to be a blue sky, but it was going to be
a beautiful, silver majestic atmosphere.''

   AVIGNON-FESTIVAL (Avignon, France) _ The Avignon Festival is the
largest theater festival in France. In its 53rd season this year,
from July 9 to 31, it presented more than 50 works of theater and
dance in 23 spaces in and around the city, from an old quarry eight
miles out of town to the traditional open-air stage of the Cour
d'Honneur in the Papal Palace. While French-language theater still
accounts for more than half of the program, this year's festival
included a special focus on South America, as well as works from
Bulgaria, Italy and Germany. By Anne Midgette. &UR;  &LR; (Moved).

<P>
   30S-FILM-SERIES (New York) _ ``The Joy of Pre-Code: Sex, Boose,
and Red Hot Jazz, 1930-33,'' is a 44-film series that starts Friday
in Manhattan. The films pushed the weakly enforced code to its
limits and beyond. For anyone brought up on the movies of the 1940s
and 1950s, those of the early '30s can be a revelation. Sinners
escape punishment and virtue is not necessarily rewarded. Crime
sometimes pays and marriage vows are frequently flouted.
Self-interest is a near-universal principle. By J. Hoberman.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ACID-HOUSE-FILM (Undated) _ ``The Acid House,'' which opened on
Aug. 6, is a triptych of three short films by the Scottish writer
Irvine Welsh. The language is coarse, with salty Scottish slang and
accompanying subtitles. The humor is dark, and, certainly in the
first two shorts, there's a fuller, albeit gloomier, sense of
working-class Edinburgh. Of the three shorts, the first, ``The
Granton Star Cause,'' about a hapless young man who loses his home,
girlfriend and job before being transformed into a fly by God, and
the third, ``The Acid House,'' a hallucinatory tale of a man who
switches identities with an infant, are closer to the movie
``Trainspotting'' in their use of Kafkaesque visuals. By David
Bahr. (Moved).

   PURE-POP-THEATER (New York) _ This year's newcomer is the Pure
Pop Theater Festival, which will kick off just hours after the
first show of the New York International Fringe Festival, which is
entering its third summer. Pure Pop's organizers promise to match
the Fringe quirk for quirk, with programming that includes a rarely
seen temperance play (``10 Nights in a Barroom'' by William Pratt),
an 18th-century Japanese epic (``The Battles of Coxinga'' by
Monzaemon Chikamatsu) and several shows with titles not suitable
for a family newspaper. All in all, Pure Pop promises to stage 60
productions over seven weeks through Oct. 3. By Jesse McKinley.

<P>
   ELLA-BAFF-DANCE (Undated) _ Don't ask Ella Baff, 45, the newish
executive director of the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, to speak
about ballet, modern dance and ethnic dance. These are labels, in
her opinion, that do not evoke dance's ``variety and texture'' (two
of her favorite words). This summer, the first season she has
programmed at the famed festival in the Berkshires, offers a hint
of what she has in mind for its future: namely, an ever-expanding
view of dance that is also increasingly international. By Anna
Kisselgoff. (Moved).

<P>
   DONKEY-DANCE-THEATER (New York) _ Every Thursday night since
January, cognoscenti have been flocking to a sassy dance-theater
performance at the Pyramid Club in Manhattan's East Village. ``The
Donkey Show,'' conceived by Randy Weiner and directed by Weiner and
his wife, Diane Paulus, is an adaptation of Shakespeare's
``Midsummer Night's Dream'' as interpreted through the lyrics of
disco music and the dances these catchy tunes inspired, including
the hustle, the bump and the freak. By William Harris. (Moved).

   CLAIBORNE-CARY-MUSIC (Undated) _ A two-time winner of New York
cabaret scene's top honor, the MAC Award, Ms. Claiborne Cary, now
in her 60s, is still a favorite within the industry but a name
popularly recognized only by a discriminating few. Since arriving
in New York from Lone Tree, Iowa in the 1950s as an aspiring
dancer, she says has most definitely ``been around'': singing and
dancing on Broadway and off and working the great cafes _ and also
the not so great _ of the city. By Barry Singer. (Moved).

   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   HARASZTY-DESIGNER (Undated) _ Eszter Haraszty was an Age of
Aquarius heroine, one part Carnaby Street to two parts Woodstock.
Though her name is unknown today, the Hungarian-born Haraszty, who
died in 1995 at 74, was an American design guru in the late 1940s
and early 1950s, thanks to the ebullient color sense and
swashbuckling patterns she championed as the director of
KnollTextiles, the fabric division of the modern furniture company
started in 1937 by Hans G. Knoll. By Mitchell Owens. (Moved).

   WATKINS-PHOTOGS (San Francisco) _ Carleton Watkins would rank
among the great enigmas of late 19th-century American art even if
his life weren't so mysterious and sad. The pictures he made of
scenic glories in the West during the 1860s and '70s have been the
sublime standard for generations of landscape photographers. The
exhibition of his work at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art
(through Sept. 7, then moving to the Metropolitan Museum of Art on
Oct. 12) offers pristine examples of Watkins the magnificent. By
Richard B. Woodward. (Moved).

<P>
   TV-DANDRIDGE (Hollywood) _ For a brief moment in the 1950s,
Dorothy Dandridge was a movie star who rivaled Marilyn Monroe and
Ava Gardner. But Dandridge's film career sputtered, and she fell
victim to personal demons, tragedy and, perhaps most of all,
bigotry. The first black woman ever nominated for an Academy Award
as best actress died penniless _ but still beautiful _ at the age
of 42 in 1965. It's still unclear whether Dandridge took her own
life. ``I saw `Carmen Jones' when I was 18,'' recalled Halle Berry,
the star and an executive producer of HBO's ``Introducing Dorothy
Dandridge,'' which has its premiere on Saturday at 9 P.M. By
Bernard Weinraub. (Moved). Photo.

 &HT;    ONLINE CAMPAIGNING JUST AS UNEXCITING AS THE REAL THING
 &HT;    610&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Interactive virtual campaigning may be the Next Big
Thing in presidential politics. But judging by Vice President Al
Gore's recent forays on line, both the medium and the message may
not yet be ready for real time.
</P>
<P>
   Seated at a computer in his Washington campaign office, Gore
spent nearly an hour Tuesday night participating in a ``real-time
online chat,'' answering a dozen out of more than 1,000 questions
that arrived from cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   His words were immediately seen by an estimated tens of
thousands of ``netizens'' who had clicked onto the interactive page
on the full-service Gore Web site (http://www.algore2000.com).
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Gore dealt with questions and comments known
in the political trade as ``softballs.'' None of the answers had
the remotest possibility of making news.
</P>
<P>
   A self-described ``long-time Democratic activist'' named Teresa
from Gore's home area of Nashville, Tenn., asked him, ``what do you
say to the naysayers about this race?'' Gore responded by quoting
Yogi Berra, who once said: ``It ain't over till it's over.'' And in
this case, it's scarcely begun.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Salazar, a campaign spokesman, said the tech-savvy
candidate typed his own responses, although ``staff members were
there to help him sort out the questions and to use those with the
broadest appeal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The answers were fed through a spell checker before moving on
line, thereby skirting the chance of embarrassment that once befell
Dan Quayle, his predecessor in the vice presidency and a 2000
Republican contender.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, Salazar said, Gore would seek backup
material. For example, he asked for a copy of his eulogy for his
father, a former senator from Tennessee who died last December.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was the greatest man I ever knew. I can't begin to
tell you how proud he made me not just in his days in public life
but every day,'' Gore wrote back to ``C.R.'' in Silver Spring, Md.
</P>
<P>
   But, for the most part, Gore produced brief responses with the
feel of canned television sound bites.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Since Gore was late in arriving, his campaign manager, Craig
Smith, was pressed into duty. Smith wound up fielding the toughest
query of the evening: ``Why is Al Gore a better candidate for
president than Bill Bradley? It seems like Bradley has more
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The question came from ``Greg in Cherry Hill, New Jersey,'' the
state that sent Bradley to the Senate three times before he
challenged Gore for the 2000 Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a choice Democratic primary voters will make,'' Smith
responded. He went on to cite Gore's work on Capitol Hill and as
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith never mentioned the president who had tapped his own
boss in 1992, and when Gore took over, 30 minutes later, the word
``Clinton'' also never crossed his keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Gore's chat sessions _ he held a prior one in early April from
Iowa _ essentially were no different than the first known
experiment in online presidential campaigning, which took place in
1992, before the World Wide Web existed. On that occasion, former
Gov. Jerry Brown of California, now the mayor of Oakland, went on
an early Internet service known as ``The Well'' in an hourlong bid
to bolster his presidential prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Historians cite Franklin Roosevelt as the first president to
harness the political power of radio, and John F. Kennedy as the
first to fully master the near-magical draw of television. But a
national politician has yet to emerge as an acknowledged guru of
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still some years away as a tool for mass media,'' said
Republican consultant Frank Luntz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the problem: Americans don't like politics. So when
they get on the Web, politics is the last thing they want to
read.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there a huge quantitative difference between Brown's
early sortie and Gore's commitment to answer e-mail from the voters
and engage in more such online sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1996 presidential election, households with Internet
access have more than doubled, to about 50 million, according to
Forrester Research Inc., a technology research firm. More than
600,000 households, about 20,000 a day, go on line every month.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the inherent shortcomings of online chat rooms as
effective political communication tools, those are numbers that
presidential candidates can no longer afford to ignore.

BUSH HEADS TO IOWA TO TEST FRONT-RUNNER STATUS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush returns to Iowa on Thursday,
the state where he kicked off his presidential campaign and the
site for the first real test of his popularity outside Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high in Saturday's Ames Straw Poll for Bush other
Republicans vying for the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the poll is a fund-raiser for the Iowa Republican
Party. Iowans who want to participate must pay $25 to vote, a fee
that often is paid by the candidates, as are transportation and
other costs.
</P>
<P>
   But the event in Ames has taken on much more significance this
year because Bush has bragged that he intends to win the poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear to me they consider it to be highly important''
because of the money, time and effort invested in the event, said
Bruce Buchanan, a political science professor at the University of
Texas who has been following Bush's political career as governor
and now as a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to reinforce their front-runner status by winning
it,'' Buchanan said of the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if money and notoriety are any indication, he's got a good
chance to win it. ... I'd be surprised if he didn't finish
strongly.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is leading the other Republican hopefuls in the polls and
has a daunting campaign treasury. A win or a strong showing for
Bush in Saturday's poll could spell the beginning of the end for
some of the less-financially fortunate candidates.
</P>
<P>
   However, even if Bush doesn't win, Buchanan said that may not be
a huge blow to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party has such an investment in him, it's doubtful they'll
let a few cantankerous Iowans upset the apple cart,'' Buchanan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to take back the White House next year, Republican members
of Congress, governors, state lawmakers and others across the
country have been lining up to endorse Bush publicly, and the money
has been pouring into his campaign _ more than $37 million so far.
Supporters seem to view him as the GOP candidate who stands the
best chance of winning in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 10,000 Iowans are expected to participate in the
poll, which promises to be a political spectacle complete with
food, live entertainment and other activities that really have
nothing to do with selecting a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The other GOP hopefuls _ among them former Vice President Dan
Quayle, Elizabeth Dole, and magazine publisher Steve Forbes _ will
be there, although Sen. John McCain of Arizona does not plan to
attend.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush camp has rented, at a one-day cost of $43,000, a prime
location just outside the coliseum where the voting will take
place. Essentially, every person walking into the coliseum will
have to pass the Bush tent.
</P>
<P>
   Before his appearance in Ames, Bush has several campaign stops
planned Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters Saturday will eat barbecue and be entertained by
country music singers Tracy Byrd and Linda Davis and Tejano singer
Emilio Navaira.
</P>
<P>
   There also will be sporting events led by San Antonio Spurs
forward Sean Elliott, former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Roger
Staubach and world champion bass fisherman Johnny Morris.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, there's the poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first real test of your organization in the state,''
Bush campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said of the straw poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a test as to whether we can mobilize our
supporters and get them to come out and vote for Governor Bush _
the same thing will have to do next year for the caucuses,'' she
said. Iowa is the lead-off state in the presidential nominating
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to win. We're working really hard, and we'll see
what happens,'' Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   And what will a loss mean? She shrugged, saying only it would be
a learning experience for everyone on the Bush team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, for the winner, it will help build momentum,'' she
added.

DEATH TAKES JOHNNY VAN RYN, 94, OLDEST DAVIS CUP ALUMNUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At his 90th birthday party, Johnny Van Ryn swirled across the
dance floor with his wife, Cornelia, showing touches of the nimble
guy who'd been a Boston favorite nearly seven decades before. His
partner in that time was Texan Wilmer Allison, their ballroom the
lawn of Longwood Cricket Club.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's prime tennis tournament then was the US Doubles
Championships, and between 1930 and 1936 you could bet that Allison
and Van Ryn would be as hot as the August afternoons when they went
together like franks and beans or lobsters and steamers.
</P>
<P>
   They were finalists six times over the seven-year stretch,
taking the titles of 1931 and 1935. ``We liked playing Longwood
very much. It was great having an important championship devoted to
doubles,'' recalled Van Ryn, who died Saturday at his Palm Beach,
Fla., home. He was 94, thus relinquishing his last title _ world's
oldest Davis Cup alumnus _ to an International Tennis Hall of Fame
comrade, Britain's Henry (Bunny) Austin, 93 this month.
</P>
<P>
   Davis Cup was the pride and frustration of John William Van Ryn
Jr.'s career. ``Eight years, four finals, and we couldn't win it,''
was his regret. ``We just couldn't beat those Frenchmen'' _ the
Four Musketeers (Rene Lacoste, Henri Cochet, Jean Borotra, Jacques
Brugnon) clutching the Cup six straight years until 1933.
</P>
<P>
   Van Ryn played and won more Davis Cup doubles matches than any
other American (22-2). He and Allison had the best US record for a
team (14-2) until John McEnroe and Peter Fleming's 14-1. Twice they
won Wimbledon (1929-30). Winning again in 1931, with George Lott,
Johnny became the only American guy to take three straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, Allison and I should have won another in '35,'' he
remembered with an embarrassed chuckle. We were talking a couple of
years ago in Palm Beach, his amiable blue eyes sparkling like the
nearby Atlantic. ``Wilmer and I had a match point in the final
against the Aussies, Jack Crawford and Adrian Quist. They put up a
fluky little lob. My ball. Easy. But for some reason I hesitated.
Wilmer decided he'd better take it and missed the shot. My fault.
All those years together and we mess up a simple play to lose in
five.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison and Van Ryn were a Southwest Conference-Ivy League
blend, Wilmer a graduate of Texas, Johnny of Princeton ('28),
getting in on a baseball scholarship. Van Ryn, a trim 5 feet 10
inches, who grew up on public courts in East Orange, N.J., was a
master in the right court, a superb returner and volleyer.
</P>
<P>
   Although he made his name in doubles, more highly regarded than
it is today, Van Ryn was no slouch at singles: six times in the US
top 10 and twice (1929, 1931) in the world top 10, No. 8 in 1929
when he made the Wimbledon quarters.
</P>
<P>
   There was no money in tennis in Johnny's time, but ``there were
perks,'' he smiled, ``and you made connections, meeting some of the
right people. Remember, it was the Depression, and we were
amateurs. We got meal money, and with the team we lived in the best
hotels and traveled first-class. It was all right.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Allison found new cars waiting for them at the dock in
New York after they'd won Wimbledon, gifts from a grateful US
Tennis Association official. The wife of a Davis Cup captain took
them to Cartier's in Paris and sprung for stunning jeweled links
and studs to complement their tuxedos. ``I chose rubies, and later
had them set in a necklace for my wife, Cornelia.''
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, released from the Navy, Van Ryn was ``hired
by Charlie Merrill, a friend through tennis, to open the Merrill
Lynch office in Palm Beach. Life has been very good.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the way Cornelia remembers 62 years of marriage. ``I kept
hearing that you had to work at a marriage,'' she says. ``But I
never found out what that meant. Johnny was so good-natured, it was
always fun.''
</P>
<P>
   From all reports, he was carefree and easy-going wherever. ``Not
in '32 in Paris,'' he said, his face clouded for a moment. That's
the time the French stole the Davis Cup. Oh, I'll never forget
that. Stole it in broad daylight. You can ask anybody, read all the
accounts about that final.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny was probably the last living witness. ``We had a terrific
team _ Ellsworth Vines, the Wimbledon champ, and Allison in
singles, and he and I in the doubles. And the Frenchmen were
wearing down. It was right after Wimbledon, and they were worried.
They watered the court heavily to slow us down, and 10,000 fans
jammed Roland Garros and were roaring for the home team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a bad start, down 2-0. Borotra beat Vines and Cochet
beat Allison. Wilmer and I had to win the doubles to keep it alive,
and we came through, beating Brugnon and Cochet in five. The next
day Wilmer and Borotra go into the fifth set and it's match point
against Borotra, serving at 4-5, 30-40. First ball into the net.
The second _ way long. Double fault. We were cheering, thinking
it's 2-2 now, and Vines will beat Cochet in the fifth match _ which
he did _ for the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it didn't matter. As Borotra and Wilmer are going to the
net to shake hands, the umpire calls, `Egalite!' Deuce. What? We
couldn't believe it. The service linesman made no call. He insisted
the serve was good, and the umpire went along with it. Wilmer lost
his composure . . . and the match . . . and the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting next to Dwight Davis, the man who gave the Cup.
A gentleman. Very dignified. I only heard him cuss once, and that
was it. `I'm sorry I ever gave the goddamn Cup!' was what he said.
But he got over it. And,'' said Van Ryn, a theft victim but smiling
again, ``so did I.''

 CHRON  
 Cheese Lovers Await the Fate of Fromage   By Janet Fletcher 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; BERKELEY, Calif. _ &LR;  On most Saturday mornings, Berkeley's crowded
Cheese Board looks like it's supplying the fromage for every dinner
party in town. Customers stand three-deep at the counter, waiting
for help in choosing the ripest Epoisses, the perfect Roquefort,
the latest artisanal goat cheese.
<P>
   ``We have a very informed customer,'' says Lisa Bruzzone, the
store's imported-cheese buyer. ``We have a lot of European
clientele, a lot of university people, and they want raw-milk
cheese. They want things that are rare, that you can only get in
France. We try to get as much raw-milk cheese as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruzzone's customers may be in for a shock if proposals to
change cheese standards become law. The National Cheese Institute,
a trade association that represents most large manufacturers, will
petition the Food and Drug Administration later this year to
require mandatory pasteurization ``or an equivalent process'' for
all milk used for cheese.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the government is already re-evaluating its raw-milk
cheese policy and recently proposed _ although it has since backed
down _ that all cheeses in international trade be made from
pasteurized milk or its equivalent.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed by these developments, the American Cheese Society,
composed primarily of small producers, has launched a
counterattack. Determined to protect the right of its members to
make raw-milk cheeses, as many do, the society is circulating
petitions and a written platform that are sure to heat up the
raw-milk debate.
</P>
<P>
   For raw-milk cheese makers, who believe their cheese is not only
safe but superior, the controversy threatens to put their future in
the hands of public health and trade officials, both here and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   At the Whole Foods cheese counter in San Francisco, mandatory
pasteurization would have a dramatic impact. Gone would be the
French Bleu d'Auvergne and Fourmed'Ambert, the Roquefort, the
Neal's Yard Dairy cheddars from England such as Keen's and
Montgomery's, the French Charollais, the Chaumes, the Boucheron,the
Chantal Plasse Morbier, the Sally Jackson Vermont Shepherd
Cheese,the Swiss Gruyere, the Italian pecorino romano ... even,
heaven forbid, the Parmigiano-Reggiano. About one-third of the
store's cheeses are raw milk, estimates buyer Kathi Demarest.
</P>
<P>
   Although government and university scientists have increased
their scrutiny of aged raw-milk cheeses, it's far from clear that
the cheeses present a public-health problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would expect that if there were a real problem with these
cheeses that we would see more illnesses, but we're playing it
safe,'' says Jack Mowbray, an FDA scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their scrutiny, scientists have a hard time recalling
any domestic illness outbreaks traced to legally made raw-milk
cheese. One widely reported West Coast salmonella outbreak in 1997
was linked to black-market queso fresco, a Mexican-style fresh
cheese made by an unlicensed producer and sold at swap meets and
flea markets. The deadly Jalisco cheese incident in 1985 was not
related to the company's use of raw milk but to its practice of
reworking cheeses that had been in distribution.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, a listeria scare in France, in which two people
died after eating what they thought was a raw-milk Epoisses, had a
surprise ending. The contaminated cheese turned out to be a fraud,
a pasteurized cheese masquerading as Epoisses (which is never
pasteurized), made by a producer who had recently been convicted of
health violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``People sometimes make the assumption that raw-milk cheese is
the cause of outbreaks, but food-borne illness from cheese is much
more frequently tied to a post-pasteurization contaminant,'' says
Debra Dickerson, an ACS spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, scientists say raw-milk cheese merits review
because bacteria have changed. When the FDA made its raw-milk rule
in 1950, requiring that unpasteurized cheeses be aged 60 days or
longer, experts believed that pathogens couldn't survive an aged
cheese's low-moisture, high-acid environment.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, researchers have now shown, under lab conditions, that
pathogens such as listeria, salmonella and harmful strains of E.
coli can survive more than 60 days in unpasteurized cheese.
</P>
<P>
   So why aren't there more outbreaks?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because true raw-milk cheese is rare, says John Bruhn,
director of the Dairy Research and Information Center at the
University of California at Davis. Most producers who don't
pasteurize do heat-treat their milk, warming it enough to kill all
or most pathogens but not enough to achieve pasteurization. The
government considers these raw-milk cheeses, although a purist
wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   But both here and abroad, there are still producers who scorn
both pasteurization and heat treatment, believing that heat
compromises quality. Heating the milk destroys not only ``bad''
bacteria, but also ``good'' bacteria and enzymes, the ones that
produce the cheese's flavor as it ages. As one agitated French
Epoisses maker told the Wall Street Journal recently, ``A
pasteurized cheese is a dead cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   Pasteurization probably would make her acclaimed Shepherd's
Cheese more bland and more uniform, agrees Jan Eckert-Twohy of
Lakeport's Yerba Santa Dairy.
</P>
<P>
   Some cheesemakers are even more adamant. ``It's very well known:
raw-milk cheeses have more complex flavor,'' says Soyoung Scanlan,
a Petaluma cheesemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Scanlan disputes the notion _ proposed by some dairy scientists
_ that laboratory-made cultures could replace the flavor that
pasteurization removes.``We can't reproduce natural microflora in
milk by adding purified bacterial strains,'' she wrote in a memo to
Dickerson. ``I was a biotechnologist. I know how people make
starter cultures. It's impossible. We can approach nature, but we
can't copy it 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   National Cheese Institute spokeswoman Cary Frye says her group
isn't trying to drive out raw-milk cheese but merely trying to
update the FDA standards and make room for new technologies. If the
FDA determines that 60-day aging is an equivalent process, then
aged raw-milk cheeses would not be affected by the proposed
changes, she points out.
</P>
<P>
   But raw-milk advocates worry that the FDA will come up with an
equivalency measure, such as a bacteria count, that rules out
raw-milk cheese. And although the Codex commission, the
international organization that sets standards for foods in
international trade, has rejected the U.S. call for mandatory
pasteurization, the issue is still on the table.
</P>
<P>
   A Codex subcommittee is meeting again in the fall and may well
decide to set international hygiene standards that only a
pasteurized cheese could meet.
</P>
<P>
   As for the NCI proposal, the FDA won't change any regulations
without a public comment period. In the meantime, the agency is
trying to confirm that pathogens indeed live in aged raw-milk
cheese. If so, FDA scientists are asking, is zero tolerance _ the
current standard _ the only safe response? Can humans, in fact,
tolerate a little listeria?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of indigenous pathogens that we deal with
successfully every day,'' says Rusty Bishop, a prominent dairy
scientist at the University of Wisconsin. ``If it's a true raw-milk
cheese, I would say a normal, healthy human should have no trouble
eating it.''
</P>
<P>
   But like other scientists, he advises caution for people with
compromised or undeveloped immune systems. ``I don't think there's
any data to say there's a problem, but I would limit intake for
infants, the elderly and pregnant women as a precaution.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Pritchard, a University of Vermont food microbiologist who
has worked on safety issues with Vermont cheesemakers, opposes
mandatory pasteurization. He would rather see raw-milk cheesemakers
required to have a HACCP plan _ a strict program for identifying
and addressing possible contamination points in production. Coupled
with rigorous and frequent testing, such a plan would allow
conscientious producers to continue to sell raw-milk cheeses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Granted, I work with listeria,'' says Pritchard. ``That's what
I got my Ph.D. in. But maybe 400 people a year die from it. Maybe.
In the overall scheme of things, it's not a lot. People need to
understand that our food supply is not sterile, that there is some
risk associated with everything we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson concurs, but with the zeal of a dedicated cheese fan.
``If the U.S. and Codex are looking for a measurable standard of
hygiene, a bacterial count of zero, I do not know how any cheese
can meet that standard unless it is sterile,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lettuce isn't sterile. Lamb isn't sterile. Potato salad isn't
sterile. Why would you ask that your cheese be?''

 WINE POTPOURRI: Get Thee to the Meadery  By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  Historical records show that mead, a fermented
beverage made from a solution of honey and water, has been known to
man for nearly 12,000 years. In Norse mythology, Odin, the Master
of the Palace of Valhalla, trained with his warriors everyday but
did not gain his strength from eating food. Legend has it that Odin
drank copious drafts of mead from the udder of a goat named
Heidrun.
<P>
   Gordon Hull, a Californian of Swedish extraction, doesn't keep a
goat at his meadery in Arcata (Humboldt County), but he does make
the world's only dry sparkling mead, and calls it Heidrun.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced in May 1998, Heidrun meads are sold in Northern
California restaurants and wine shops.
</P>
<P>
   Hull and I met recently at Greens restaurant in Fort Mason, with
Greens general manager, Rich Jones, for a tasting of Heidrun meads,
followed by a symbiotic pairing of the meads with Green's
vegetarian food.
</P>
<P>
   The earthy natural flavors of mead, especially dry mead, are a
great match with the Indian and North African spices used at
Greens. It was clear to me that Hull is onto something; mead could
easily be the next hot match with today's popular full-flavored
foods.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 years ago, Hull, a geologist by trade, began dabbling
in home brewing. Before long he realized that the science of
fermentation held more interest than the science of geology, so
Hull enrolled in the brewing school at the University of California
at Davis. Still, the transition from professional rock hound to
experimental brewer wasn't complete.
</P>
<P>
   Then Hull discovered mead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The true essence of honey is very subtle and each honey has a
distinct chemical characteristic that gives the mead its
distinctive taste,'' says Hull, but he admits that not all honeys
are good for making mead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a process of trial and error to find out what appeals to
the public, and the process appeals to me,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   At present, Hull makes four sparkling dry meads, each from a
different blend of honeys purchased throughout the state. ``I do
everything myself at the meadery, except gather the honey. Seth
Rick in Shively is my main supplier and I get honey from Hollister
and Shingletown.''
</P>
<P>
   At Hull's tiny cutting-edge meadery in Arcata, he produces about
70 cases a month, with a capacity of 150 cases. And he can make
mead year round. ``Honey can be stored for up to a year, but I
usually only store it for a few months before making the mead.''
</P>
<P>
   Making mead is a slow process, with the length of fermentation
lasting 10 days to three months, depending on the type of honey
used. One part honey is diluted in 4 parts water. Nutrients and
fruit acids are then added to the solution to compensate for
honey's deficiency of these components. After fermentation, the
mead rests in a tank for about a month before being bottled.
</P>
<P>
   Heidrun meads are different from other commercial meads, like
Baregetto's Chaucer Mead, because they are made sparkling, using
the traditional Champagne method of fermenting in the bottle. Hull
says that sweetness in mead masks the honey's delicate aromatics
and flavors, so he prefers dry mead.
</P>
<P>
   The tasting at Greens proved his point. Of the four sparkling
meads Hull currently has in his line, I found the Heidrun Shively
Spring Bloom the most intriguing. The Shively is a blend of apple,
blackberry and clover honeys, with a lovely nose of green olive,
fennel and a little nuttiness. It is dry with crisp acidity and a
balanced finish, a nice match with lightly curried yellow pea soup.
</P>
<P>
   Heidrun Shively Autumn Bloom, a new mead that will be released
later this year, is a blend of fennel, morning glory, pennyroyal,
sunflower and clover honeys. It has a slightly green floral aroma
and a distinctive herbal-floral flavor with a hint of bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   The Heidrun Wildflower Mead, blended from alfalfa and clover
honeys, is slightly sweet, more delicate, with good complexity and
length. And the Heidrun Sacramento Wildflower, from a blend of
manzanita and toyon honeys, is more earthy/woody, with delicate
flavors and a slightly sweet lingering finish.
</P>
<P>
   One of the many nice things about Heidrun hand-crafted meads is
the reasonable price. All Heidrun sparkling meads sell for $15 to
$18 retail and can be found at Mollie Stone's Markets, Real Food,
Andronico's, The Jug Shop and Beltramo's, among others. Greens has
Heidrun on its beverage list for $25, and Hull has placed his meads
in a few other Northern California restaurants, including The
General's Daughter in Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for a moderately priced alternative to white
wine that is pleasant to sip on a warm summer day, as well as a
great match for spicy foods, try Heidrun Mead.

Wine Q &AMP; A
</P>
<P>
   Q: C. Earlenbaugh of Oakland inherited a bottle of Charles Krug
1972 Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon and is curious about its value
and if any restaurant has an interest in adding his Cabernet to its
wine list.
</P>
<P>
   A: Not knowing the history of your wine, I can only give you
some general advice. Vintage 1972 was not that good in the Napa
Valley for red wines, and most of the best wines were already
tiring by the early 1990s. Since any remaining '72s are not
generally on collector's lists, my suggestion is to gather together
a few friends and enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, restaurants can not legally purchase wine from a
private party.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Since first tasting the 1995 Signorello Napa Valley Cabernet
Sauvignon on a business trip, Janne Mahan of Menlo Park has been
searching local wine shops for the wine.
</P>
<P>
   A: Signorello reports the wine is mostly sold out, but you might
check the Adronico's in your area, or call Linda at Signorello,
(707) 255-5990.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A few weeks ago, a reader asked about the availability of
Barbera Blanc, a blush-type wine made from the Barbera grape.
</P>
<P>
   A: Readers came to the rescue informing Potpourri that a Barbera
Blanc called Imbianco is available for $9.50 at Viansa Winery,
25200 Arnold Drive in Sonoma and at Viansa's Lo Spuntino tasting
room on the square in Sonoma.

secrets for making it a success. Tips and recipe follow in optional

 Soup  
   
   
 By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Roland Passot is considered one of the best French
chefs in the city, and what he produces at his restaurant, La
Folie, is anything but simple. In the classic French style, Passot
blends lots of elements to produce fresh and exciting combinations.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A native of Lyons, the chef came to the United States more than
20 years ago to work with Jean Banchet at the famous Le Fran &LR; c &LR; ais
near Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   But now he's a Californian at heart, and his Leek and Corn
Veloute with Rock Shrimp is amazing for its simplicity and for its
full-rich flavors. For this dish he sautes shallots and leeks in
butter before tossing in fresh corn, cream, chicken stock and
vermouth. A blender and strainer insure a silken texture, and rock
shrimp, sauteed quickly in butter add an exciting element to the
center of the bowl.
</P>
<P>
   If you prefer, lobster or poached oysters are great substitutes
for shrimp. If using oysters, poach them in the vermouth for 1
minute before adding to the soup.
</P>
<P>
   And here's our own little secret. Because of the combination of
ingredients _ and the vermouth _ canned chicken stock works as
well. Just tell your friends it's from Roland Passot and they'll
think you spent days in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  La Folie, 2316 Polk Street (near Union), San Francisco; &LR; 
 &LR; (415) 776-5577. Dinner Monday-Saturday. &LR;

<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; The vermouth.  &LR; This secret ingredient is undetectable in the
finished soup, but it adds richness and a complex depth of flavor.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Straining the soup.  &LR; In many recipes a chunky soup is fine, but
in this case you want a silken texture to set off the seafood, so
it needs to be blended smooth, then passed through a fine strainer.

 &QL; 
LA FOLIE'S LEEK &AMP; CORN VELOUTE WITH ROCK SHRIMP
</P>
<P>
   Chef Roland Passot may be French, but this amazingly simple soup
is truly Californian. It features the season's best fresh corn in a
smooth-as-satin, creamy veloute. The garnish of quickly sauteed
rock shrimp give the creation a touch of sweetness from the sea. To
vary the dish, you may substitute lobster or poached oysters. If
using oysters, poach them in the vermouth for 1 minute before
adding to the soup.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   4 leeks (white part only), well washed, and thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 pound shallots, peeled and chopped
</P>
<P>
   Kernels from 3 ears of fresh corn, or 11/2 cups frozen kernels
</P>
<P>
   1 cup extra-dry vermouth
</P>
<P>
   1 quart cream
</P>
<P>
   1 quart chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound rock shrimp, shelled and deveined
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Warm 1/2 cup butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat.
</P>
<P>
   Add the leeks and shallots and sweat until translucent, about 5
minutes. Add the corn and saute for 15 minutes. Remove 6
tablespoons of the mixture from the pan and reserve for garnish.
Add the vermouth to the pan and reduce by half. Add the cream and
bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Add the chicken stock, return
to a boil and simmer for about 15 minutes. Transfer to a blender,
puree well, then pass through a fine mesh strainer.
</P>
<P>
   Season the shrimp with salt and pepper, then saute in the
remaining 2 tablespoons butter until pink in color, about 2
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Ladle into bowls, allowing 2 or 3 shrimp per serving.
</P>
<P>
   Garnish with the reserved corn and leek mixture.

 LEARNING TO COOK: Who's Afraid of An Aspic Salad?   By Marion Cunningham  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  You'd be lucky to find a box of unflavored gelatin
in anyone's kitchen these days. Most young home cooks have never
enjoyed chilly, quivering, summer aspic salads.
<P>
   Aspics are quite wonderful on warm summer days served with cold,
cooked shrimp on the side _ or any cold cooked fish for that
matter. I served tomato aspic for lunch the other day with deviled
hard-cooked eggs and warm buttered whole-wheat bread, plus fresh
fruit and cookies for an easy dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Preparations for putting together an aspic salad are so easy the
dish could be considered fast food, but it does take several hours
for it to chill and become firm. It must be made several hours in
advance.
</P>
<P>
   Jelled salads and desserts have become d &LR; e &LR; class &LR; e &LR;  and some
probably should have disappeared entirely, but we've thrown out the
very good with the bad. Try today's tomato aspic salad and see what
I mean.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(BEGIN RECIPE) &QL; 
 &QL; 
TOMATO ASPIC
</P>
<P>
   This is a refreshing salad for warm summer or fall days. It must
be made ahead of time because it takes 2 or more hours to chill and
set up. But it also is a good keeper: It stores well in the
refrigerator for 4 or 5 days.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   4 cups cold tomato juice
</P>
<P>
   2 envelopes unflavored gelatin
</P>
<P>
   1 celery stalk
</P>
<P>
   1/2 small yellow onion
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon pepper, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preparing juice and gelatin: Pour 1 cup of the tomato juice into
a measuring cup. Sprinkle gelatin over juice; stir for a couple of
seconds. Set juice aside.
</P>
<P>
   Pour remaining 3 cups tomato juice into a 2-quart saucepan. Set
saucepan on a burner, but don't turn on heat yet.
</P>
<P>
   Preparing vegetables: Rinse and dry celery. Cut celery stalk
into 1/8-inch-thick lengthwise strips. Holding strips together, cut
them into 3-inch long pieces. Holding each bundle of strips
together, cut crosswise into tiny pieces. You need to have at least
1 cup chopped celery, so cut more if needed. It isn't necessary to
be exact about amounts of vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Slice off and discard fuzzy brownish root end and stem top of
onion. Peel off and discard papery outer brownish-yellow skin of
onion.
</P>
<P>
   Put onion half cut-side down on a cutting board. Cut slices
crosswise from stem top to root end. Then holding the onion
together, chop lengthwise into tiny pieces. You'll need 1 cup of
chopped onion.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking vegetables in tomato juice: Add chopped celery, onion,
bay leaf, sugar, salt and pepper to the 3 cups tomato juice. Stir
in tomato juice/dissolved gelatin mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Turn heat to medium. Gently warm juice mixture, stirring now and
then, until it is hot. Do not let it boil. You will need to stand
right by the stove. As soon as it is hot, it is ready for the
finishing step.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing the aspic: Select a 11/2-quart bowl, dish or mold. I
use a heat-proof glass loaf pan, 81/2x41/2x3 inches deep. (Using a
loaf pan makes it easy to slice portions the thickness desired.)
</P>
<P>
   Remove bay leaf, then pour the warm mixture into the bowl or
pan; let cool. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until aspic
jells and you are ready to serve. (It will take at least 2 hours
for aspic to firm up, so plan to make this several hours or even a
day ahead.)
</P>
<P>
   If you want to turn the aspic out of the loaf pan or bowl, put
container in hot water for a few seconds, this will soften the
outer surface and allow you to easily slide it out of the container
onto a platter. It also looks nice placed on butter lettuce leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Keep any leftovers refrigerated.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.

BATTLE OVER LEGAL FEES HEATS UP ONCE AGAIN IN TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEXARKANA, Texas _ A 19-month war over legal fees in Texas'
tobacco lawsuit grew longer Wednesday when the state attorney
general rejected an offer by five private lawyers to drop a
potential claim for $2.3 billion of the state's tobacco settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The offer, made in open court before a federal judge, had
conditions that would have impeded the state's investigation of the
lawyers' conduct during the tobacco litigation, said a
representative for Attorney General John Cornyn.
</P>
<P>
   But an attorney for the five lawyers said Cornyn, a Republican
who campaigned against high legal fees, was playing politics.
</P>
<P>
   The outside legal team, hired by Cornyn's predecessor, Democrat
Dan Morales, helped negotiate a $17.3 billion settlement for Texas
last year. Morales had sued tobacco companies over public health
costs associated with smoking and cigarette marketing practices.
</P>
<P>
   A national arbitration panel last December awarded the lawyers
$3.3 billion, which is to be paid by cigarette companies over a
number of years. But Cornyn contends that the attorneys _ Walter
Umphrey and Wayne Reaud of Beaumont, John Eddie Williams and John
O'Quinn of Houston and Harold Nix of Daingerfield _ also may try to
claim an additional $2.3 billion from the state.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Tigar, a former University of Texas law professor who
represents the five attorneys, has repeatedly denied Cornyn's
contention. Tigar has said the $2.3 billion, which was awarded by
U.S. District Judge David Folsom under a contingency contract
between the lawyers and Morales, will be offset by the higher
arbitration panel award.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawyers haven't sought dismissal of their $2.3 billion
claim, and so far, Folsom hasn't ruled on the state's motion to
dismiss it.
</P>
<P>
   Tigar told reporters, after Wednesday's court hearing, that his
clients have been using the $2.3 billion award as leverage against
the state, should Cornyn sue them for alleged misconduct and try to
lower their $3.3 billion in fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have some leverage on their side. We have some leverage
on our side, if you want to look at it that way,'' Tigar said.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn, who fought the lawyers over their payments while running
for attorney general last year, is believed to be investigating
whether the attorneys structured a lucrative fee agreement that
harmed the state's interests.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn also has been keeping an eye on a federal investigation
into allegations that Morales improperly solicited $1 million from
lawyers he considered hiring for the tobacco suit. The allegations,
which Morales and the five lawyers have denied, were raised last
year by plaintiffs lawyer Joe Jamail of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has questioned Jamail and at least two other Houston
lawyers about the allegations. The money purportedly was solicited
to help Morales defend himself against attacks by tobacco
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Tigar said the outside lawyers would drop any potential claim to
the additional $2.3 billion if Cornyn would agree within 48 hours
to support the $3.3 billion arbitration award, subject to the
attorney general's continuing investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a disservice to the citizens of Texas for this
spectacle to continue,'' Tigar said. ``The trial team is
disappointed that their services have somehow become politically
unacceptable.``
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn didn't attend Wednesday's court hearing. However, his top
assistant, Andy Taylor, said Tigar was merely trying to
``camouflage'' his clients' attempt to hold the state ``hostage on
a $2.3 billion contract claim that taxpayers will have to pay.''

EDITORS NOTE: Bay Area Classics profiles food-related businesses
more than a half century old.  BAY AREA CLASSICS: Candymaker Finds Success  
   
 By Elizabeth Brubaker  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 FAIRFIELD, Calif. _  We are in an era of huge corporations with
multimillion dollar marketing budgets and long lists of
subsidiaries. But even big corporations had to start somewhere, and
the Herman Goelitz Candy Co., makers of Jelly Belly jellybeans, is
proof that underneath corporate success, there often is a
foundation of gritty determination.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1868, brothers Gustav and Albert Goelitz emigrated from
Germany to Belleville, Ill. The two started what was destined to
become a family candy tradition, now in its fourth generation.
</P>
<P>
   The Goelitz brothers were forced to sell the business in 1893
during one of the country's economic downturns. But soon after,
Gustav's sons, Herman, Adolf and Gustav, started a new company in
Chicago, making candy corn and other candies from their father's
traditional mellocreme base recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Herman moved his share of the business to Oregon in 1919, and
then to Oakland in 1922. He eventually passed his share to
son-in-law, Ernest Rowland.
</P>
<P>
   After the company survived the financial swings of the
Depression, World War II and the subsequent economic boom, Ernest
brought his son, Herman Rowland, into the business. Herman is now
the company's CEO. ``I started going to the factory when I was 6 or
7 years old . . . it was all I ever wanted to do,'' says Rowland.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Rowland modeled his work ethic after his father's.
Both men were willing to go to any lengths to assure the company's
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father would stay after production hours and do the
janitorial work . . . I started working there in high school as a
candy packer. I've done every job there is.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, while sugar prices soared, Goelitz candy corn sold
for 20 cents a pound _ only four cents more than in the 1920s.
Rowland was willing to do whatever it took to keep the factory
running: ``I was rototilling the neighbors' backyards on my tractor
to feed my family.''
</P>
<P>
   His determination kept the company alive until the 1970s, when a
new product was introduced that would assure the company's future.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, a client in Los Angeles suggested that the Goelitz
company make jellybeans from natural flavors rather than artificial
ones, and the Jelly Belly jellybean was born.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, presidential candidate Ronald Reagan gave the company
better marketing than money could buy by naming the Jelly Belly his
favorite confection. By 1981, the Herman Goelitz Candy Co. was
backlogged 76 weeks in jellybean orders.
</P>
<P>
   Today, jellybeans make up more than 70 percent of the company's
50 million pounds of annual candy production, which includes a
variety of gummies, licorice bridge mix, Dutch mints, and, of
course, candy corn.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 40 official Jelly Belly flavors, there are
always new candies on the Goelitz drawing board, like autumn
leaves, which will be life-size pectin confections, and a Tabasco
Jelly Belly being made in consultation with the McIlhenny Tabasco
Sauce family.
</P>
<P>
   Herman Rowland, whose favorite Jelly Belly is juicy pear, says
the company is concentrating on grassroots ways to market its
candies, such as sponsoring local sports events.
</P>
<P>
   The company, whose factory is located in Fairfield, recently
opened a visitors' center with a retail store, an exhibition
kitchen, and a cafe serving Jelly Belly-shaped burgers and
sandwiches and Jelly Belly-flavored food such as milk shakes. Free
factory tours are given along an elevated walkway that overlooks
the 215,000-square-foot space. At the end of the tour, everyone is
given a sample of jellybeans.
</P>
<P>
   From packing candy to managing a company that employs more than
600 people, Rowland has worked hard in virtually every aspect of
his family's business. And he's determined to protect the candy
company's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got through our hard times, and I don't want to go back
there.''

 TASTER'S CHOICE: Low-Fat Dressings Fail to Impress Tasters  
   
 TASTER'S CHOICE  
   
 By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  With summer's produce hitting the market in full
force, many of us are turning to salads as supper.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But with bathing suit season not yet over, low-fat versions of
salad dressings are a staple.
</P>
<P>
   Today's panel tried six varieties of low-fat bottled Caesar
salad dressings, possibly the most popular salad dressing _ at
least among restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists tasted the dressings on their own, as well as tossed
with chopped romaine lettuce.
</P>
<P>
   None of the dressings impressed the panel, but they considered a
couple suitable for people who are on restricted diets.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Johnny's Great Caesar Lite &LR;  (8 ounces, $3.99 at Safeway) came
in first. Two panelists particularly liked the cheese flavor, and
another described it as ``a good attempt.'' But others thought the
flavor was horrible and chalky. Two would buy it; three would not.
</P>
<P>
   Second place went to  &UR; Girard's Light &LR;  (12 ounces, $3.69 at
Safeway). Most of the panelists found the flavor to be harsh and
chemical-tasting. Two panelists picked up a mustard flavor (there
is no mustard in the ingredient list). Three might buy it; two
would not.
</P>
<P>
   Third place went to  &UR; Girard's Fat Free &LR;  (12 ounces, $3.69 at
Safeway). One panelist thought it was a decent attempt at Caesar
dressing, but another didn't think it tasted like Caesar at all.
Two panelists described the flavor as much too sweet. One might buy
it; four would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cardini's Light  &LR; (12.5 ounces, $3.69 at Safeway) came in
fourth. Two panelists compared the flavor to mayonnaise. One
thought it was particularly sweet, while another couldn't get past
the unpleasant chemical flavor. One might buy it; four would not.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth place went to  &UR; Kraft Free &LR;  (16 ounces, $2.99 at
Andronico's). One panelist described the texture as a bit starchy,
but liked the way it coated lettuce. But others described the
flavor as gummy and awful. One might buy it; four would not.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also tasted Wish-Bone Fat-Free, but it scored too low
to rate. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Panelists were John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Marc Halperin,
culinary director, Center for Culinary Development; Donna Katzl,
chef-owner, Cafe For All Seasons, San Francisco; Kim Severson,
Chronicle staff writer; and Kirk Webber, chef-owner, Cafe Kati, San
Francisco. All products are tasted blind. &QL;

<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Pakistan fired a surface-to-air missile at an
Indian aircraft Wednesday, keeping tensions between the belligerent
neighbors at a high boil.
</P>
<P>
   The missile, which missed its target, was aimed in the direction
of two jet fighters and three helicopters flying near the wreckage
of a Pakistani naval surveillance plane that was shot down by India
on Tuesday morning, killing the 16 people on board.
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Rashid Qureshi, Pakistan's chief military spokesman, said
one of the jets had been the target. India said that a helicopter
ferrying reporters to the crash site was the intended quarry.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred as both nations eagerly displayed huge
chunks of mangled wreckage near their respective sides of a
disputed border area, each insisting that the debris they possessed
conclusively proved that the naval plane had been flying above
their nation's airspace.
</P>
<P>
   To explain why Pakistan had a share of the wreckage, Indian
officials said the 90-foot naval plane _ once it had been hit by an
air-to-air missile _ turned back toward the border and some of the
pieces had actually made it home.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you shoot an aircraft, it doesn't drop like a stone; it
glides,'' said Group Capt. D.N. Ganesh of the Indian air force.
</P>
<P>
   To explain why India had a portion of the damage in hand,
Pakistani officials said the Indians had arrived at the wreckage
first and absconded with assorted rubble.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stole a few pieces of the plane so they could fool the
world,'' said Commander Roshan Khayal of the Pakistani navy.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, it was clear that sections of the downed
plane, a French-built Breguet Atlantic-1, were strewn across a wide
area and much of the detritus was buried deep in the marshy ground
of a shifting tidal channel known as Sir Creek. No bodies have been
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Creek, which lies between the western Indian state of
Gujarat and the southern Pakistani state of Sindh, is one of many
contested boundaries between the nations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   India and Pakistan, both now nuclear powers, have fought three
wars with each other since they won independence in 1947. The
second of these conflicts, in 1965, actually began in the Sir Creek
area with both sides claiming that the other was intruding.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the two nations seemed on the brink of yet another war
as Pakistani-backed infiltrators seized mountaintop positions
within the Indian state of Kashmir. While India's military response
was intense, using air power and a huge troop deployment, New Delhi
won world approval for its restraint in not sending its forces
across the so-called Line of Control into the Pakistani-held part
of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, despite the fact that one of its MiG-21 fighter jets
had destroyed the far-slower, propeller-driven Atlantic-1, India
attempting to make the case that it had again used restraint before
attacking what it said was a spy plane.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ganesh, two Indian jets intercepted the Pakistani
plane 10 miles inside Indian territory and repeatedly instructed
its pilot to land at an Indian air base. One of the MiGs even flew
abreast of the Atlantic-1 and waggled its wings before veering
away, a signal that the slower plane was to follow it down.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Pakistani plane combatively flew toward the MiG,
Capt. Ganesh said. ``It was like the Pakistani pilot was trying to
play chicken and that's when he got shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistani account is much to the contrary. According to
Khayal, the plane was on a routine training flight for junior
pilots. It never left Pakistani airspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could this propeller plane make an aggressive move against
a jet?'' he said. ``This was simply murder, and we have lost 16 of
our brave soldiers.''

 SALMON KINGS: This year, the big one didn't get away - the 
 California catch is fabulous.   By Janet Fletcher  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  For fans of California king salmon, this summer
has brought no end of pleasure. The catch has been strong, the
price low and the quality exceptionally high.
 &HT;    ``This year has been the best I can remember in a long time,''
says Tim Ports of San Francisco's Fresh Fish Company, which
supplies some of the Bay Area's top restaurants. For Bay Area chefs
the superior season offers a chance to showcase a local product
that isn't always so abundant or consistently good.
 &HT;    Last year, in the final throes of El Nino, the harvest was a
different picture. Experts speculate that the unusually warm ocean
limited the amount of fish food available, so the few salmon caught
were scrawny and lean.
 &HT;    This year is producing ``great big, fat fish,'' says Tom
Worthington of Berkeley's Monterey Fish, whose wholesale arm
supplies Chez Panisse, Zuni Cafe, Hayes Street Grill and others.
``I don't know if it's great bait they're eating or what, but this
year they're firm and full of fat. Everything about them seems to
be a notch above what they usually are.''
 &HT;    Matt Erickson, a marine biologist with the state's Department of
Fish and Game, believes that the fish are bigger this year because
they're older. Fish that normally would have headed upriver as
3-year-olds didn't have the fat deposits to spawn last year so they
spent an extra winter in the ocean. Wholesalers say they are seeing
many 20-pound fish and few of the less-desirable, six- to
seven-pounders.
 &HT;    What's more, the fish are close, so fishermen can get their fill
on day trips. Worthington says he is seeing a lot fewer boats that
go out for days at a time, which compromises the quality of their
catch. ``They're cleaning and icing them and bringing them straight
in,''says Worthington.
 &HT;    Many Bay Area chefs express a preference for wild king salmon
over farmed Atlantic salmon (see related story). Typically, the
farmed salmon is higher in fat, but the king salmon has more flavor
and sweetness, they say.
 &HT;    ``Wild salmon is the only kind we use,'' says Russell Moore,
co-chef of the Chez Panisse Cafe. ``We wait for that first spring
salmon and use it until the end of the season. By then, we've had
our fill. As for farmed salmon, I think, and Alice (Waters) agrees,
that it has a sort of muddy quality.''
 &HT;    Some chefs, such as Farallon's Mark Franz, say the high-fat
Atlantic fish is the better choice for curing _ in gravlax, for
example. Others praise the reliability of the farmed fish
suppliers, who can deliver fish of a specified size. For Cakebread
Cellars chef Brian Streeter, who often serves a lot of people the
same meal simultaneously, farmed salmon provide the consistency he
needs.
 &HT;    ``I can send 20 portions out the door and they all look alike,''
says Streeter, who acknowledges a preference for the taste of wild
salmon.
 &HT;    Ports bristles when chefs tell him they can't accommodate
variation in size. ``We don't sell shoes, dammit, we sell fish,''
he barks. ``You can't tell the fishermen to just catch the big
ones.''
 &HT;    Delfina chef Craig Stoll, a wild salmon enthusiast, is resigned
to taking whatever size comes. ``It's well worth it,'' says the San
Francisco chef. ``I'd rather adapt to the fish than specify
farm-raised fish so the shape is right.''
 &HT;    This summer, Bay Area chefs are submitting wild king salmon to
every treatment imaginable: slow cooking, searing, grilling,
baking, smoking, curing and even no cooking at all.
 &HT;    At San Francisco's Jardini e re, chef Traci Des Jardins is
offering salmon carpaccio with green olive vinaigrette and fava
bean blini. Salmon carpaccio also is on the menu at Zax in San
Francisco, with a mustard caper vinaigrette and spicy greens. At
the new Red Herring in San Francisco, chef James Ormsby is making a
Moroccan salmon tagine with chickpeas, eggplant, Israeli couscous
and, to top it off, a yogurt-cucumber-preserved-lemon salad.
 &HT;    ``It's such a pronounced flavor, you either have to do something
very simple with it, like sea salt and a little spinach, or you
have to do something really spectacular,'' says Ormsby.
 &HT;    Spectacular is a fitting description for king salmon
preparations at Aqua: a terrine of lightly smoked salmon and
mascarpone with osetra caviar and miniature bagels; salmon baked
slowly in lobster-flavored clarified butter, and a whole boned and
tied salmon marinated with foie gras drippings, lemon and honey,
then roasted. ``We call it a prime rib of salmon,'' says chef
Michael Mina. ``It's nice and medium-rare in the middle.''
 &HT;    Several Bay Area chefs say they're sold on the benefits of slow
roasting. Stoll bakes his salmon at 325 degrees, Streeter at 300
degrees. Alice Waters, in her new ``Chez Panisse Cafe Cookbook''
(HarperCollins, September 1999), includes a recipe for baking a
whole side of salmon at 200 degrees for an hour. The result in all
three cases is a remarkably moist, evenly cooked and almost
custardlike texture.
 &HT;    Des Jardins prefers high heat that crisps the skin and leaves
the interior medium-rare. She starts the fish skin-side down in a
hot pan, then finishes it skin-side up in a hot oven. ``And I
employ the same philosophy with fish that I do with meat,'' says
the chef. ``It needs to rest a bit.'' Letting a seared fillet stand
for 3 or 4 minutes after cooking will yield a more evenly cooked
texture.
 &HT;    To skin or not to skin? Most chefs agree that salmon tastes
better if it's cooked skin-on because the skin protects the flesh
and bastes it with fat. But they say their customers dislike the
sight of it, so they routinely remove the skin after cooking, or in
some cases before.
 &HT;    The king salmon season closes in California September 30. While
it lasts, consumers might want to get their fill of this local
delicacy, either at restaurants or in their own home kitchens. The
following recipes from local chefs should provide inspiration.

 Farmed Versus Wild Spawns Ruckus  
   
 By Janet Fletcher  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  Like many of his colleagues, Delfina's Craig Stoll
believes farmed salmon is a respectable product worth using when
the wild run ends. Other restaurants _ among them, Rose Pistola,
Zuni Cafe and Chez Panisse _ take salmon off the menu when the fish
stop running. In those kitchens, wild salmon is considered not only
better tasting but also a better environmental choice.
<P>
   Both Rose Pistola chef Erik Cosselmon and Zuni Cafe chef Judy
Rodgers say they exclusively use wild salmon in part because they
are concerned about the impact of fish farming. Environmentalists
claim that the fish farms generate harmful waste products; some
worry that the farmed Atlantic salmon could escape and cross with
wild fish, creating offspring without the instincts to find their
spawning grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the red herrings they drag out,'' responds Dale
Blackburn, general manager of Stolt Sea Farm in British Columbia, a
major supplier of farmed salmon to the Bay Area. ``Atlantic salmon
have never been able to colonize outside their normal range.''
</P>
<P>
   All animal husbandry has an environmental impact, admits
Blackburn, but fish farms do no permanent damage. To guarantee
that, British Columbia has some of the world's most stringent
regulations on fish farming. Besides, argues Blackburn, farmed fish
take the pressure off the wild run.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had no farmed industry, we'd have no wild industry
either,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, says Monterey Fish's Tom Worthington. State fish and
game officials limit the wild catch to help maintain or replenish
stocks. They wouldn't allow a larger catch just to fill demand, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem with the always-available farmed salmon, says
Worthington, is that it diverts public attention from the need to
protect wild salmon.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't connect the dots,'' says the wholesaler. ``They
say, `What's the problem? It's there all the time and it's
cheap.'''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, wild salmon has suffered from overfishing and loss of
spawning habitat, as water projects disrupt rivers and streams.
Some worry that, like the Atlantic cod, it may have a bleak future
if corrective measures aren't taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to know how much wild salmon we should be taking so we
don't end up with the cod problem,'' says Zuni Cafe's Rodgers.
``But the larger issue may be the loss of streams and rivers. If
that continues, it doesn't matter how many we take. They're going
to die out.''
</P>
<P>
   California Department of Fish and Game lieutenant Mark Crossland
admits that wild salmon endured years of mismanagement, when
officials failed to protect their fresh-water spawning grounds.
Today, it is illegal to fish commercially for salmon in rivers, and
fish and game officials, in conjunction with other agencies in
Oregon, Washington and Idaho, closely manage the season to allow
the weakest stocks to replenish.
</P>
<P>
   State-run fish hatcheries also soften the impact of habitat
loss, says Matt Erickson, the marine biologist. ``With our hatchery
system, and our attempts at mitigating problems with habitats, and
our keeping an eye on how much is being taken every year, I think
we're doing a pretty good job.''

<P>

 &UR; ABOUT SALMON BONES &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Salmon fillets have tiny pin bones that should be removed before
cooking or marinating. They are in a neat line in the thickest part
of the fillet, and you can feel them if you run your hand down the
length of the fish.

<P>

 &UR; SALMON SOURCES &QL;  &LR; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Wild king salmon can be purchased at the following locations
throughout the season. A survey of markets selling wild salmon
earlier this week showed prices for whole or half salmon ranged
from $3.69 per pound to $10.95 per pound. Salmon steaks ranged from
$4.69 per pound to $10.95 per pound.
</P>
<P>
   Fillets ranged from $5.99 per pound to $11.95 per pound.
</P>
<P>
   However, prices are subject to market fluctuations based on the
availability of fish. Dockside sales, where salmon can be purchased
directly from the fishing boats, occur sporadically throughout the
season. Call during the week to find out if sales are planned for
following weekend.

   2 anchovy fillets
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, sliced
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup finely minced Italian parsley
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup finely minced fresh mint
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon finely minced capers
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Vegetables &AMP; Fish
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound cranberry beans or other fresh shelling beans
</P>
<P>
   1 rib celery, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 carrot, peeled and coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/4 yellow onion
</P>
<P>
   2 sprigs each, parsley, sage and thyme, tied together
</P>
<P>
   2 bay leaves
</P>
<P>
   3 garlic cloves, peeled but left whole + 1 garlic clove, minced
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound Blue Lake and/or yellow wax beans, frenched if desired
</P>
<P>
   4 king salmon fillets, 6 ounces each
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 red onion, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   20 cherry tomatoes, halved
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Instructions: To make the salsa verde:  &LR; Combine the shallot and
vinegar in nonreactive bowl and let stand for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Using a mortar and pestle, pound the anchovies to a paste. Add
the garlic and a pinch of salt and pound to a paste.
(Alternatively, mince the anchovies, garlic and salt to a paste by
hand.) Transfer to a bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Add the parsley, mint, capers and olive oil. Drain the shallots
(reserve the vinegar) and add to the bowl. Season with salt. Let
stand 30 minutes, then taste again and adjust seasoning with salt
and some of the reserved vinegar if needed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The vegetables &AMP; fish:  &LR; Shell the cranberry beans and place
them in a pot. Add the celery, carrot, yellow onion, herb bouquet,
bay leaves and whole garlic. Add water to cover by 3 inches and
bring to a boil over high heat. Skim, then reduce heat to maintain
a gentle simmer and cook until the beans are tender and creamy.
Season with salt; let cool in the liquid. This step may be done 1
day ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Blanch the green or yellow beans in a large pot of boiling
salted water until just tender. Drain, cool under running water,
then drain again and pat dry.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Season the salmon with salt and pepper. Put 1 tablespoon of the
olive oil in a saute pan or sheet pan. Add the salmon and turn to
coat with oil.
</P>
<P>
   Bake until the salmon just flakes, about 15 minutes. Because of
the slow cooking, it will appear less cooked than it really is.
</P>
<P>
   While the salmon bakes, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive
oil in a large skillet over moderate heat. Add the onion and saute
until softened. Add the minced garlic and saute briefly to release
its fragrance. Add the tomatoes, blanched beans and cranberry beans
with a few tablespoons of their cooking liquid. Season with salt
and pepper. Cook briskly until the vegetables are hot throughout
and the juices have reduced considerably, coating the beans in a
juicy ragout.
</P>
<P>
   Divide the bean ragout among warmed serving plates. Insert a
thin metal spatula between the salmon meat and the skin. Lift the
salmon up, leaving the skin behind. Place the salmon fillets on top
of the ragout. Drizzle with salsa verde.

tender but not mushy. Drain well.
</P>
<P>
   Beat the potatoes with 5 tablespoons of the olive oil in a mixer
with a paddle attachment until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.
(Potatoes may be mashed by hand with a potato masher for a more
rustic result.) Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

<P>
   Shell the fava beans. Blanch the beans in boiling water for 1
minute, then drain. Transfer to ice water; drain when cool. Peel

drain. Repeat 2 times with fresh water. Slice the garlic.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the tomatoes, 1 tablespoon olive oil and salt to taste
in a saucepan; warm over moderate heat. When the tomatoes begin to
give off their juice, add the fava beans, garlic, sun-dried
tomatoes and olives. Cook, stirring, until hot throughout. Lower
heat and keep the sauce warm while you cook the salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Heat a large skillet over moderately high heat. When very hot,
add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and swirl to coat. Add
the salmon skin side down. Reduce heat to moderate. Season the
salmon with salt and pepper. Cook 2 minutes, then place in the oven

ROSE PISTOLA'S CURED SALMON with GREEN PEPPERCORNS
</P>
<P>
   Like ceviche, this salmon is ``cooked'' in a citrus marinade.
You can use the same technique with halibut.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 11/2 pounds skinless king salmon fillet, in one
piece
</P>
<P>
   11/4 cups white wine
</P>
<P>
   11/4 cups fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   2 small bay leaves
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 1/2 cup best extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons + 2 teaspoons green peppercorns, lightly crushed
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Using a very sharp knife, slice the salmon thinly on the
diagonal, as for smoked salmon. Arrange the pieces in a single
layer in a nonreactive dish.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the wine, lemon juice and salt and stir until the salt
dissolves. Pour over the salmon, making sure it is completely
submerged. Make additional wine/lemon juice mixture if necessary to
cover the salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Tear the bay leaves in half and tuck here and here. Cover and
refrigerate until the salmon is almost fully ``cooked'' by the
acid, about 2 hours.
</P>

SAN FRANCISCO _  SALMON  _ For fans of California king salmon, this
summer has brought no end of pleasure. The catch has been strong,
the price low and the quality exceptionally high. Wholesalers say
they are seeing many 20-pound fish and few of the less-desirable,
six- to seven-pounders. &HT;     
This salmon package consists of a main story, side stories on
farmed vs. wild salmon, salmon sources, about salmon bones and how
Bay Area chefs are serving up salmon. Package also includes 7 Bay
Area chefs' recipes.

 &HT;    Winged invasion gives living room a Stephen King atmosphere
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Going home each evening I review strategies and
psyche myself up the coming battle.
</P>
<P>
   I do this to avoid painful injuries.
</P>
<P>
   There will be confrontations. This much I know. I just don't
know where or when.
</P>
<P>
   It's been this way for the past month. I've learned to stay on
constant alert every time I step foot inside my house.
</P>
<P>
   A man shouldn't have to live this way in his own home. It seems,
however, that I have been chosen to endure this test. Perhaps I
deserve it.
</P>
<P>
   My home didn't become a Stephen King nightmare overnight. It
slipped up on me.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, I think it was more like two months ago when it
actually began. That was the night that the first angry red wasp
dive-bomber came at me from somewhere high up in the vaulted
ceiling of my living room.
</P>
<P>
   I spotted the movement coming toward me out of my peripheral
vision and knocked the assailant out of the air on its final
approach to my face. I leaped from my sofa-recliner and beat the
beast to death with the current edition of Cycle World before he
could recover his senses and launch a second attack.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, I didn't think much about the incident. I often
encounter the odd wasp, bee, mud dauber, yellow jacket, spider,
scorpion or tree roach with an attitude in my house. I punch their
tickets to Bug Valhalla and go about my business.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know how these critters sneak into the house without
tripping the burglar alarm, but they do.
</P>
<P>
   After about a month, it dawned on me that the red wasp attacks
had become daily rather than occasional. Checking around the house,
I discovered about a dozen red wasps doing angry wasp aerobics on
the brown wooden beams high up in my living room ceiling. They
seemed disturbed that I spotted them. One launched an immediate
attack.
</P>
<P>
   We've been fighting it out ever since. Every day I punch a few
more wasp tickets and every day they get more reinforcements.
</P>
<P>
   I have several cans of wasp and hornet spray that probably can
reach the 25- or 30-foot top of the ceiling. But the stuff will
stain the paint. I do not want to repaint the living room. And, of
course, you can hardly paint one room without painting all the
rooms. So wasp spray is out.
</P>
<P>
   I gave up my living room and now watch television or read in the
den or bedroom. I can fight them on even terms in rooms with low
ceilings, especially after purchasing fly swatters for every room
and placing them in strategic positions for quick access.
</P>
<P>
   When the wasps increased their numbers to two dozen or so, I
came up with the idea of sucking them into a Shop Vac with an
extra-long extension wand.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring they wouldn't like this, I put on my full racing
leathers with my name across the back to let them know who was
coming. I also put on my boots, leather gloves and full-face Arai
helmet.
</P>
<P>
   Thus attired, I hauled the Shop Vac into the living room with a
step ladder, set everything up and flipped the switch.
</P>
<P>
   This was not a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   I had wasps all over me. At least, I thought I did.
</P>
<P>
   I ran out of the living room, jumped, jerked and twitched until
I felt it safe enough to take off my motorcycle gear after a quick
return to the living room to turn off the Shop Vac. Eventually I
retrieved my useless wasp weapons and returned them to the tool
room.
</P>
<P>
   One day I tried leaving all the doors open. The only thing that
left the house was about $150 worth of air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   The latest wasp census finds 62 red sadists in my living room.
</P>
<P>
   My current plan is to maintain a DEFCON-2 alert status, hit them
hard when they come into a low-ceiling room and let them starve to
death. They do have to eat, don't they?

DELAY OVER DAEWOO RESTRUCTURING PLAN ROILS SOUTH KOREAN MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In a move that gave many investors a sickening sense of
deja vu, the South Korean government put off the announcement of a
much-awaited restructuring plan for the troubled Daewoo Group that
had been expected Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Supervisory Commission, the agency that has
effective control over most Korean banks and financial
institutions, said Daewoo and its creditor banks would sign a plan
to overhaul the conglomerate's financial structure next Monday and
that no announcement would be made before then.
</P>
<P>
   The delay apparently reminded investors of delays in other
pending deals and sent them scurrying to sell South Korean stocks,
pushing the market's main index down 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely made the market nervous,'' said Namuh Rhee, head
of research at Samsung Securities in Seoul. ``I don't think it was
overblown, either. The market has been very volatile, and the
volatility has increased over the last two months because of these
types of uncertainties.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors are haunted by delays the government has encountered
in selling off Korea First Bank and Seoul Bank, which it
nationalized in the aftermath of South Korea's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times have we been on the verge of a final signing
ceremony, only to have these deals keep dragging and dragging?''
said Jang Ha-sung, a professor of finance at Korea University and a
prominent shareholder activist.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo is the most troubled of the big conglomerates, known as
chaebol, that are considered responsible for much of the economic
crisis that first gripped South Korea two years ago. Unlike other
chaebol, Daewoo has been slow to sell or close the money-losing
operations in its far-flung mix, and the company is perilously
close to defaulting on its estimated $50 billion in debts.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Daewoo's financial crisis has been under active
discussion since last fall, Jang said he was jarred by how
haphazard the government's approach to resolving it now appears to
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, the government knew the seriousness of the problem
because I personally had a conversation with a person in charge of
such matters,'' he said. ``Consequently, I was expecting the
government would immediately jump into this matter with a
well-planned scheme, but it looks like they had no plan at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Park, a spokeswoman for the commission, said the
postponement was largely the result of procedural issues, not an
indication of disagreement among Daewoo and its creditors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will most likely finish the plan today, but it still has
to go through the more extended creditors' group for approval,''
she said. ``Most of the main issues have been resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Chung Dae-chang, a spokesman for Daewoo, denied that there was
any delay and said news reports quoting Daewoo officials saying
that a plan for overhauling the group's business would be announced
Wednesday were a ``misunderstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   He also cautioned against expecting any formal announcement on
Monday. ``Next Monday there will only be the agreement between
Daewoo and its domestic banks,'' Chung said. ``I don't know whether
there will be any announcement then.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Daewoo's creditors have been pushing for drastic cuts in the
group's scope by trying to force it to sell everything but Daewoo
Motors, three automotive parts affiliates and the group's trading
and heavy machinery businesses, according to executives at two
creditor banks.
</P>
<P>
   But Daewoo still has the power to resist their efforts because
any overhaul of Daewoo will require the involvement of its founder
and chairman, Kim Woo-choong, the one man who has a bird's eye view
of the group's operations.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo's creditor banks have virtually no experience with the
most basic corporate restructurings, let alone one of the scale and
complexity of Daewoo. ``No one knows the situation better than
Daewoo executives, and that's a very big obstacle to reform,'' Jang
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kim returned on Monday from what a Daewoo spokesman described as
a ``customary'' trip in Europe, which suggests that he has not been
intimately involved with the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   There has been substantial movement in the talks. An executive
at one of the creditor banks said Daewoo now seemed prepared to
sell Daewoo Securities and Seoul Investment Trust Co., two healthy
financial affiliates that it had initially resisted selling. The
two companies have extended more than $1.7 billion of financial
support to weaker Daewoo affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the fate of Daewoo Construction, the group's
construction operation, seems to be further complicating
negotiations with creditors, according to some investors. No local
construction companies are interested in it, and foreigners have
thus far proven reluctant to wade into the Korean construction
business.

NEW SERIES TO PUSH THE BLEEPING ENVELOPE ON FOX 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Chris Thompson, the creator of the new television
series ``Action,'' a scabrous insider look at the cutthroat world
of Hollywood, still recalls his first meeting with Doug Herzog,
president of the Fox Entertainment Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you willing to be the most outrageous show on
television?'' Thompson asked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's the funniest one,'' Herzog replied.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which will be broadcast next month on Fox, may not be
the funniest show on network television, but it's certainly one of
the more outrageous: a satire about an egomaniacal Hollywood
producer of action films who downs Xanax, berates waiters, hires a
former child star-turned-prostitute to his executive staff and uses
the foulest language _ bleeped but still recognizable. In short,
it's a slice of life, Hollywood style.
</P>
<P>
   What makes ``Action'' unusual is that such language and sexual
references and situations have rarely, if ever, been seen on
network television. (The show will be aired on Thursdays beginning
Sept. 16, from 9:30 to 10 p.m.). While cable television, notably
HBO, offers acclaimed series like ``The Sopranos,'' ``Oz'' and
``Sex and the City,'' with street language and sometimes
provocative sex talk and scenes, network television has never
ventured quite this far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without question, it pushes the envelope,'' Herzog said. ``But
at the end of the day, give us credit for stepping out and trying
something different as opposed to another watered-down sitcom.''
</P>
<P>
   Herzog is hardly alone in pushing the envelope.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, shows like ``NYPD Blue,'' with its partial
nudity and strong language, as well as ``Homicide'' and ``Law and
Order'' have sought to infuse a sense of gritty reality in the way
their characters speak and behave. To writer-producers, the realism
of these shows _ and several others _ is the direct result of two
overlapping developments: the success of HBO and of MTV, with its
sometimes sexually charged lyrics and imagery, as well as declining
network audiences and the almost desperate attempt to lure them
back.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Bochco, who helped create ``NYPD Blue,'' said his mandate
from ABC six years ago while shaping the show ``was to come up with
something that would at least begin to compete with cable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons network drama took a terrible beating
between the mid-'80s and the early '90s was we couldn't compete
with theatrical movies shown on cable,'' Bochco said. ``The viewer
makes no distinction between a movie on HBO, which may be hipper,
more graphic and realistic, than one on a network.''
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, Bochco said he negotiated with ABC for more than a
year on how far he and his partner on the series, David Milch,
could go in terms of language and sex. Bochco said there have been
only a handful of contentious issues: on a recent show, for
example, ABC adamantly refused to allow detailed dialogue of what a
molester did with teen-age boys. ``I certainly could understand
their anxiety about it,'' Bochco said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bochco said working on ``NYPD Blue'' was not especially
frustrating in terms of network limits, he envies the freedom
enjoyed by David Chase, the creator of ``The Sopranos,'' on HBO.
That acclaimed show, about a New Jersey mob boss and his family,
uses explicit language, nudity and intense violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a vast difference between `NYPD Blue' and `The
Sopranos' in terms of what you see, what you hear and the level of
violence,'' Bochco said. ``It would be fun, from a writing point of
view, to write with that kind of realism. Would it be nice to have
that kind of leeway? Sure. Does it get in our way in terms of
developing the kind of intimacy in a relationship that we want to
achieve? Not really.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Bochco said he had serious problems in the '80s
with NBC on another show he helped create, ``L.A. Law,'' about a
sleek law firm. ``The biggest problem was sex _ what you could see,
what you could show,'' he said. ``They were nuts about that.
Terrible, terrible prudes.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, and largely because of cable, prudishness
has clearly declined. ``The network standards people have been
trying to hold off the dam from breaking for years and years, and
they've sort of given up,'' said Ted Harbert, a television producer
at Dreamworks and former chairman of ABC Entertainment. He said
that HBO, Showtime, and especially MTV, had a major impact on
network television.
</P>
<P>
   ``In truth, the number of people watching HBO and Showtime is
far smaller than the number of young people who grew up watching
MTV, which changed the standard in what is now acceptable in the
homes of young viewers,'' Harbert said. He cited the sexual
imagery, language and lyrics on music videos on MTV. The result,
Harbert said, is that shows with sexual content as diverse as
``Suddenly Susan,'' ``Friends'' and ``Spin City'' are on the air as
early as 8 p.m. now.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Certainly ``Action'' is not the only on-the-edge network show
scheduled to be shown soon. ``Falcone,'' a series about the Mafia
spun off from the film ``Donnie Brasco,'' is scheduled to start
sometime later in the year or early next year. Production of the
show, played against a backdrop of violence, was delayed by Leslie
Moonves, president and chief executive of CBS Television, after the
shootings at a Colorado high school.
</P>
<P>
   Moonves said he was aware that the show could become a
``lightning rod'' but that the success of ``NYPD Blue'' had opened
the door for a more candid approach. ``One of the reasons we're
pushing the envelope is we're competing more and more with cable,''
Moonves said. ``All you have to do is see a show like `The
Sopranos,' where the lead character is a murderer, the language is
extreme and it's accepted as one of the finest hours on television.
It's almost like networks are forced to deal with a new network
standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, CBS and Fox turned down ``The Sopranos,'' after
network executives characterized it as just another Mafia show.
Chase, the series' creator, and the production company,
Brillstein-Grey, then took the script to HBO, where the language
and situations were made even more realistic.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has clearly taken a different stance for next season.
</P>
<P>
   The new show, ``Action,'' goes as far as any network series has
_ and Thompson, the creator, said he was amazed that Fox, as
opposed to HBO, was showing the program. The show was initially
written for HBO, after the cable network went to Joel Silver, a
prominent action producer (``Lethal Weapon'') and asked him to
create a satire about the movie business similar to ``The Larry
Sanders Show,'' the HBO show starring Garry Shandling.
</P>
<P>
   Silver sought out Chris Thompson, a friend and veteran
television writer whose credits range from ``Larry Sanders'' to
``Laverne and Shirley'' and ``Bosom Buddies.'' Thompson, 46, is a
somewhat dyspeptic and ironic writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be cathartic _ we'd go and write cruel
jokes about people who treated us badly,'' he said in his office in
Culver City. ``I sort of sat down and created this world that would
start with the pitch of a movie and end with the premiere of it.
And in between it would be pretty much every tale of horrible
self-indulgent behavior that I knew about or had experienced.
Between Joel and I, we had experienced a great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   (Silver, a somewhat larger-than-life producer, said, ``The guy
in the series is a composite of a lot of guys I know, and maybe a
little of me sneaks in too.'')
</P>
<P>
   But the series unraveled because of a disagreement over
licensing fees and other financial issues. ``Action'' was then
given to Fox, which has succeeded over the years with edgier shows
ranging from ``In Living Color'' to ``Married with Children'' to
``The X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   Herzog, the Fox executive, said: ``Some of it will offend, some
of it is outrageous. But there's no question that there's a little
bit of a dry spell in the world of half-hour sitcoms and it's time
to try new ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Action'' stars the comedian Jay Mohr as a golden boy producer,
appropriately named Peter Dragon, whose newest film, ``Slow
Torture,'' is a dud. He is promptly scratched off party lists and
forced to wait more than an hour for a table at Morton's. His
entourage includes his Uncle Lonnie (Buddy Hackett) as a one-time
Borscht Belt comic and now chauffeur and Wendy Ward (Ileana
Douglas) as a child actress turned cocaine addict turned call girl
turned movie executive. (``She is modeled on a couple of people I
know,'' Ms. Douglas said.
</P>
<P>
   In the first episode, an agent (played by a real-life former
agent and now a manager, Gavin Pollone), pitches a client to the
producer for a sequel to ``Slow Torture.'' The client is identified
as one of the most famous people in the world, one who ``children
in Calcutta will recognize.'' Who is it? O.J. Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said, ``The problem with shows about Hollywood, like
the problem with shows about rock and roll, is that they never seem
real because you always have to avoid the fact that people talk
like 6-year-olds and that there's dubious sexuality and/or abusive
behavior going on.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, he said, Fox has asked for adjustments in language not
so much for curse words but for ``political correctness.'' The
network also asked for changes in a brief scene in which the
producer's 10-year-old daughter was drinking champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, a high school dropout who grew up in Hollywood and
was, he said, a delinquent until he began writing, said, ``I'm
working out a lot of demons on this show.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that ``Action'' probably scratched the surface of what
Hollywood was really like. ``When you're dealing with the Hollywood
community, you can get to a certain point of outlandishness but
you're still not at the reality point,'' he said. ``You can get to
a certain level of bad behavior but you still haven't gotten to
where it really is, because where it really is is almost
unbelievable.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ For the first time since he started trading
stocks 16 years ago, Helio Ozaki, the chief trader at a small
securities firm here, is shifting his focus to New York. His firm
plans to move much of its trading of Brazilian shares to the New
York Stock Exchange because declining volume and high transaction
costs have sapped much of the activity on the local market.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most melancholic times of my career,'' said
Ozaki, 40, in an interview at his trading desk on Avenida Paulista,
a skyscraper strip that is the Wall Street of Sao Paulo, Brazil's
financial capital. ``Foreigners have lost their interest in the
Brazilian market, and we Brazilians are being forced to trade our
own stocks in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Brazil's government imposed a tax on financial
transactions in June, volume on Latin America's largest market, the
Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, has dropped by a third. With many banks
and brokerage houses opting to trade in international centers like
New York and London, the Sao Paulo market has become a victim of a
trend that has spread through Latin America in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   While markets like the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ are
thriving, and even considering issuing shares to the public, their
counterparts in Latin America are struggling to survive. The
institutions in the region once synonymous with capitalism could
fall prey to the volatile capital flows that once fueled their
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what happens when the migration of capital turns so
free,'' said Ivan SantAnna, 58, who left a career as a trader in
the Brazilian and U.S. markets to become an author of novels of
financial intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most telling indicators of the problems faced by
Latin markets is a region-wide plunge in trading volume. After
swelling when foreign interest in Latin equities reached a peak in
mid-1997, volume has fallen in markets from Bogota to Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   From July 1997 to July 1999, the average daily trading volume on
the Sao Paulo exchange fell by 75 percent, in Mexico City by 48
percent, in Lima by 69 percent, in Buenos Aires by 37 percent and
in Bogota by 74 percent, according to Economatica, a Sao
Paulo-based economic research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Some smaller exchanges, like the Maracaibo stock market in
Venezuela, have shut down. Others, like the 156-year-old Rio de
Janeiro exchange, Latin America's oldest market, have made radical
changes to stay alive. In July, the exchange in Rio switched from
the old-fashioned auction system with screaming floor traders to an
electronic trading system similar to the NASDAQ.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Latin America's stock exchanges have
suffered a decline in business. Over the years, they have been
subject to swings between euphoria and despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Similar phenomena occurred in 1914 with massive capital flight
out of Brazil to Europe to help fund the First World War,'' said
Gail Triner, an economic historian at Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are signs that this latest bout with fickle money
flows may test Latin markets in unprecedented ways.
</P>
<P>
   Transnational corporate takeovers have rocked some exchanges.
When Repsol of Spain acquired YPF SA of Argentina earlier this
year, it chose to delist the big oil company from the Buenos Aires
market. In one swoop, the exchange lost one of its largest
companies and about 15 percent of its market capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is the proliferation of American depository
receipts, or ADRs. These securities represent shares of foreign
stocks that can be traded in the United States. Foreign companies
can also raise money in United States markets by issuing new ADRs.
And there are similar securities called global depository receipts
that can be listed on stock exchanges in other financial centers,
like London.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Latin America's largest companies have increasingly used these
securities in the last few years, starting in 1990 with the
region's first ADR, from Compania de Telecomunicaciones de Chile.
There are now 95 Latin ADRs listed on the New York Stock Exchange
and a handful more on NASDAQ, according to Guzman &AMP; Co., a
Miami-based securities firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The growth of ADRs happened after companies sensed they could
widen their investor base,'' said Leo Guzman, the firm's president.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these securities were listed in the mid-1990s, when much
of Latin America, aside from Mexico, was buoyed by strong flows of
foreign investment into local stock markets. With business going
well, resistance to this trend, and others that strained local
exchanges, was not that strong. That has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is worrisome that the authorities are standing by while the
capital markets of this country are being squeezed,'' said Alfredo
Rizkallah, the president of the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, which is
known as the Bovespa.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere are the problems of Latin America's troubled stock
markets more apparent now than in Brazil. Last week, the Bovespa's
300 floor traders halted dealings for half an hour to protest the
shift in business to the New York Stock Exchange, where costs are
cheaper largely because of the financial-transaction tax here. The
traders received support from their brokerage houses and the
administration of the stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The tax on almost all financial transactions is part of the
government's effort to contain the budget deficit, a piece of
discipline that is a critical component of an aid agreement with
the International Monetary Fund that has helped stabilize Brazil
since the currency crisis in January.
</P>
<P>
   Over one year, the government hopes to collect about $9 billion
from the tax, which has proved easier to collect than income tax or
many corporate taxes, as the banking system is closely regulated by
the central bank.
</P>
<P>
   The tax shows another weakness that has contributed to troubles
at Brazil's stock exchanges: the deficit. Since Brazil has had
difficulty reigning in public spending, many investors have cut
their holdings of Brazilian securities because they feel this
stifles economic growth. The deficit also contributes to a low
domestic savings rate, which translates into less capital to invest
in stocks.

 &HT;    Schools accountable for graduates
 &HT;    (This is an editorial from Thursday's Atlanta Constitution.)
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The pledge by 49 Georgia school superintendents to
stamp a ``guarantee'' on their students' college-preparatory
diplomas is little more than a publicity stunt, but the message of
accountability it sends is right on target.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 alone, nearly 5,000 students in Georgia's four-year
colleges and universities were deemed unprepared for college work
and plopped into remedial classes. Most were products of Georgia
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   How did it happen that so many high school graduates made it
into Georgia colleges without the skills to do the work?
</P>
<P>
   Some superintendents say it's the colleges own fault for
admitting students who do not, in fact, have college-prep diplomas
or, in some cases, any diploma at all. But University System
Chancellor Stephen Portch is probably right when he says that grade
inflation and weak secondary education are more often the culprits.
</P>
<P>
   There's little point, though, in sending academically weak
college students back to their old school systems for remediation.
Most students would find that demeaning and discouraging, and
there's no reason to think the same environment would better
prepare students the second time around.
</P>
<P>
   Two-year community colleges are ideally suited to offer the
remediation. While they admit many academically prepared students
who attend for financial or other practical reasons, they also
admit many students who are not yet quite ready to do college work.
</P>
<P>
   Remedial programs, by the way, will always be necessary as long
as we have the severe poverty and isolation that disadvantage
children in the inner-city and rural areas of this state.
</P>
<P>
   However, secondary schools do have a responsibility to shore up
their instructional programs _ even to bring along those children
from disadvantaged circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than paying colleges back for remediation, they ought to
lobby the state for more funds for such things as after-school
programs, which can help those students who have fallen behind.
</P>
<P>
   And why stop with college-prep diplomas? School systems should
tighten up their vocational diplomas, too. After all, as Portch
points out, 48 percent of the kids going to technical schools need
remedial classes.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see how high school students can fool themselves
into thinking they can goof off for four years and still be ready
to sail into college or a top-notch vocational school. But we
should expect school systems to know better.

 &HT;    Immigrants deserve better welcome
 &HT;    By Joe Geshwiler
 &HT;    (This is an editorial from Thursday's Atlanta Constitution.)
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This nation of immigrants likes to think it projects a
beacon of freedom and even refuge to oppressed people worldwide.
But its treatment of would-be immigrants is sometimes downright
un-American.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has detained
immigrants without bond or right to a hearing on their status. It
has indefinitely jailed citizens of countries with which the United
States has no diplomatic relations. It has retroactively upgraded
minor criminal charges against arrested immigrants, thereby making
them eligible for deportation.
</P>
<P>
   And it has held asylum-seekers in prisonlike settings even after
the INS determines they have legitimate concern about persecution
in their homelands.
</P>
<P>
   INS Commissioner Doris Meissner has announced some changes for
the better. She promises a case-by-case review for detained
noncitizens and expedited releases for those who qualify. She wants
to streamline the process of sending illegal immigrants back to
their countries so as to minimize detention time.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration also is asking Congress for $230
million for more detention space; that ought to make the INS less
dependent on farming out detained immigrants to state and local
jails, where too often they are mistreated. The administration also
wants to alter the 1996 law to allow the discretionary release of
aliens who are judged no danger to the community or a flight risk.
</P>
<P>
   The fixes sound reasonable but don't go far enough. Meissner
must inculcate respect for rights and due process in unenlightened
corners of the INS bureaucracy. A big step in that direction would
be INS cooperation with the American Bar Association in giving
detainees their rightful access to legal representation.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has every right to set and enforce standards
for admitting people who want to settle in this country, but it
ought to do so in keeping with its cherished ideals of fairness and
justice.

 &HT;    One nation, under fire
 &HT;    (This is an editorial from Thursday's Atlanta Constitution.)
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Now it's Los Angeles' turn.
</P>
<P>
   Our nation's long, mad season of shooting sprees continues.
Fifteen were shot dead at Columbine High School in Littleton,
Colo.; six were wounded at Heritage High in Conyers; two were
killed and nine wounded in suburban Chicago and Indiana; 12 were
killed in a rampage through metro Atlanta. Now Los Angeles must
confront the horror.
</P>
<P>
   The California attack was particularly cowardly _ an apparent
hate crime aimed at children. A man believed to be armed with an
assault weapon went into a Jewish community center on Tuesday and
opened fire on a group that included children as young as 5. Three
children, a teen-ager and a 68-year-old woman were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   After turning himself in to the FBI in Las Vegas on Wednesday,
the suspected shooter, identified as Buford O. Furrow, told
investigators he wanted his spree ``to be a wake-up call to America
to kill Jews,'' according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   There is no place in this country that is immune to gun
violence. On average, 86 people are killed by guns in the United
States each day, the highest rate in the industrialized world.
Certainly, urban centers such as Atlanta and Los Angeles have had
more than their share of fatal shootings.
</P>
<P>
   But there is something in the recent string of shootings that
shocks even those who have become battle-hardened by life on our
mean streets. The violence has struck in unexpected places, and the
shooters have had the intent and the weaponry to injure or kill as
many people as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Why are these terrible things happening? Like the deadly rampage
against blacks, Jews and Asians by Benjamin Smith in July, the
tragedy in Los Angeles appears to be sparked by nothing more than
ugly racial hatred. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center,
the suspect, Furrow, once belonged to a white supremacist group,
the Aryan Nations, and had close ties to another, the Order.
</P>
<P>
   Did the suspects also have an obvious mental illness? Former
neighbors of the shooter said he had mental problems. According to
published reports, he tried to commit himself to a suburban Seattle
psychiatric hospital last year but ended up in jail for a knife
attack on the staff.
</P>
<P>
   Are some of the recent string of shootings copy-cat behavior,
inspired by the intense media coverage of prior acts of madness?
The news media not only struggle with the consequences of reporting
too much on these events, but also with the price that might be
paid if too little is reported. Would the public be better off
ignorant of the dangers and the problems that lead up to these
shootings? Few would say it would be.
</P>
<P>
   But the bits and pieces of information about the shooters and
the speculation and analysis that follow explain very little about
a tragedy such as the shooting rampage in Los Angeles on Tuesday.
It remains, at its heart, inexplicable _ beyond our understanding.
</P>
<P>
   There is just one common denominator in all these incidents _
guns, whether they are in the hands of fringe haters, enraged
losers or demented youth. There can be little doubt that the easy
availability of firearms plays a major role. But there are those
who argue that further restricting guns is not the answer; some
even say the solution is more guns, so people are better able to
protect themselves. (Indeed, on some talk show in America
somewhere, no doubt, some fanatic has already suggested that had
all the toddlers had firearms, they would have been able to defend
themselves.)
</P>
<P>
   With each tragedy, the argument rages on until our voices are
inevitably drowned out by gunfire from the next massacre.

<TEXT>
<P>
   You'll find lots of books and Web sites devoted to
vegetarianism, but these are our picks for kids who don't eat meat.
``A Teen's Guide to Going Vegetarian''
</P>
<P>
   by Judy Krizmanic
</P>
<P>
   Puffin, $9.99.
</P>
<P>
   Chapter headlines such as ``What is a Vegetarian Anyway?''
``What will your parents say?'' and ``Surviving at School'' reveal
this book's teen-friendly bent. The book includes several recipes,
including some basic vegetarian lunch-box creations, such as hummus
on pita bread, but the main point here is straight talk about the
developing body and a meat-free diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Teen's Vegetarian Cookbook''
</P>
<P>
   by Judy Krizmanic
</P>
<P>
   Viking Press, $9.99
</P>
<P>
   Basic information for the new and longtime vegetarian. This
just-on-the-shelves collection of more than 120 vegan (read ``no
meat, milk or eggs'') recipes (from apple-date desserts to homemade
granola to zesty BBQ burgers) includes a food chart on nutritional
values and a glossary of cooking terms and unusual ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vegetables Rock! A Complete Guide for Teen-age Vegetarians''
</P>
<P>
   by Stephanie Pierson
</P>
<P>
   Bantam Doubleday Dell, $12.95
</P>
<P>
   As the mother of two teen-age vegetarians, author Pierson gives
humorous but practical advice on such topics as dealing with
miserable school lunches, staying emotionally calm about what you
eat _ or don't eat _ and navigating restaurants and fast-food
joints. The 60 recipes are culled from chefs, cookbooks, and
magazines and include one for a dairy-free creamy peanut butter and
banana pudding that sounds simply sumptuous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone''
</P>
<P>
   by Deborah Madison.
</P>
<P>
   Broadway Books, $40.00.
</P>
<P>
   This exhaustive-but-exciting compilation by the author of the
highly popular ``The Greens Cookboo''k has won a couple of
prestigious awards, including the Julia Child Cookbook of the Year
Award. But you probably don't care about that. What you will like
is the variety of yummy recipes that prove that vegetarianism means
more than munching on warmed-over tofu. Quesadillas. Tortilla soup.
Macaroni smothered with onions. Cakes, tarts and mango sherbet. Is
it time to eat yet?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vegetarian Teen''
</P>
<P>
   by Charles Salter
</P>
<P>
   The Milbrook Press, $22.40.
</P>
<P>
   Written by a psychologist-nutritionist concerned with the
self-esteem of those who choose this nontraditional nutritional
path (Shakespeare was a vegetarian, too!), this book is also heavy
on facts about how dietary changes affect the teen-age body. Advice
for teens includes how to get parents to go along with vegetarian
ways and tips for athletes with special nutritional needs. Kirkus
Reviews called the recipe section ``easy, appealing and
sophisticated'' and the book ``all in all, right on target.''

community center here Tuesday morning and the murder shortly
afterwards of a letter carrier, had escaped a huge police dragnet
by taking a taxi to Las Vegas, where he turned himself in at the

TOWN'S SPANISH-ONLY LAW DRAWS CRITICISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL CENIZO, Texas _ The leaders of an impoverished town on the
banks of the Rio Grande drew criticism Wednesday for approving an
ordinance that requires all local government business to be
transacted in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, they will have to realize English is the language
and they are in the United States,'' Webb County Judge Mercurio
Martinez said of the town of 1,500 residents 10 miles south of
Laredo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would tell the mayor: `You blew it. You pulled a major
boo-boo,'' said Martinez, whose mother is from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rafael Rodriguez and the two city commissioners of El
Cenizo approved the Spanish-only ordinance last week, along with
another municipal law that calls for firing any municipal employee
who helps the Border Patrol apprehend illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, whose county includes El Cenizo, praised the efforts
of the Border Patrol and said no one should forget about federal
money spent in South Texas to upgrade drinking water, roads and
sewage-treatment facilities.
</P>
<P>
   But the controversial ordinances were seen by the town
leadership as ways to open government and protect residents in a
primarily immigrant community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is discrimination not to speak Spanish and explain what is
going on,'' said Rodriguez, who does not speak English. ``We have a
right to share our opinions and know what is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The ordinances stipulate that local governmental transactions,
such as city council meetings, will be conducted in Spanish and
that English translation will be provided with 48 hours' notice.
</P>
<P>
   In compliance with state and federal laws, written ordinances
will be adopted in English and translated into Spanish, according
to documents filed at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the town has been declared a ``safe haven'' for
undocumented immigrants and employees face dismissal if they assist
Border Patrol agents.
</P>
<P>
   Laredo Mayor Betty Flores praised El Cenizo's mayor for his
efforts to get people involved in government. Still, she said,
every effort should be made to do things in English.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are going to make a conscious decision to live in a
country where the predominant language is English, we should learn
English for our benefit,'' said Flores, for whom English is a
second language.
</P>
<P>
   ``His heart is in the right place,'' she said of the El Cenizo
mayor. ``We can not second guess him; he is the one who is in the
field taking fire.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tony Zavaleta, a dean at the University of Texas at
Brownsville, said the community, which was incorporated in 1989, is
off to a rough start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is wrong. They are splintering themselves off from
everything institutional in our country,'' said Zavaleta, who for
eight years was a Brownsville city commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should think of themselves as George Washington, Sam
Houston or Benito Juarez and get this thing going right,'' Zavaleta
said.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted El Cenizo's ordinances would one day be struck down
in court.
</P>
<P>
   El Cenizo, which is home to poverty and numerous unpaved
streets, was originally a sprawling housing development that lacked
running water and electricity.
</P>
<P>
   With improvements and an increasing population, the community
incorporated as a city, although it retains its strong immigrant
roots.
</P>
<P>
   Most people here are either from Mexico, are married to a
Mexican, or are the children of immigrants. Rodriguez, the mayor,
came to the United States illegally from Mexico but is now a U.S.
citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Heredia, a professor of linguistic psychology at Texas
A&AMP;M International University in Laredo, said El Cenizo's leaders
may be thinking just like founding fathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, you can see Texas is separatist and proud,''
said Heredia, who was born in Mexico and grew up in California.
``These people do not feel like they are part of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They live in bad conditions and are trying to make a statement
to ensure a sense of identity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An official with the Immigration and Naturalization Service,
which oversees the Border Patrol, said there were no plans to take
legal action against the town government, but referred to a 1996
federal law that forbids cities from limiting the contact between
its employees and immigration agents.

TEXAS LOTTERY OFFICIALS OPTIMISTIC AS SALES IMPROVE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Many Texans who saved money during the sales tax
holiday last weekend apparently gave their spare cash to the state
anyway _ in the form of lottery wagers, Texas Lottery Commission
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said last week's 5.41 percent jump in total sales
compared to the previous week bodes well for the struggling games,
which still suffer from a two-year decrease in some prize payouts
that disenchanted many players.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are optimistic that the Legislature's decision in May
to rescind the instant game prize cap will soon be reflected in
higher instant-ticket sales as the games carrying improved odds
become available at retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the agency's freshest data, which included two of the
three days of the state's first sales tax moratorium, showed a
third consecutive week of increased sales after an enduring slump
that began in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   While officials cautioned that three weeks do not a trend make,
and that last week's total sales were still 17 percent lower than
those of a year ago, they're confident the games have turned a
corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing that `percentage down' reduced, which is what we
had hoped we would see,'' said Chairman Harriet Miers of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of both on-line ``lotto'' games and scratch-off games
showed improvement last week at a time when Texans usually don't
flash a lot of spare cash, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slowly but surely,'' lottery marketing director Toni Smith
assured commission members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did see a 5 percent increase this past week in light of the
sales tax not being charged on clothes. That would typically be a
slow week for us, right before school starts, so we're pleased with
that,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Commission member C. Thomas Clowe of Waco said the gradually
improving sales data are welcome news, especially given predictions
that the sales slump would be unabated for several more months
while old games sold out and new instant games reached retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something that we would expect to be instantaneous
following the passage and effective date of the bill'' that
repealed the payout cap, Clowe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to need to advertise and inform the players of the
change. It does take some time for this to come about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery director Linda Cloud said she's sticking by her
prediction that it will take more time to recoup lost players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have strong feelings that in October, November,
December _ when we get all the games out there replaced with
higher-payout games _ you'll see sales come back up again,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing it gradually, but not enough to get real excited
about it yet,'' Cloud said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond sales data, Cloud said she's also encouraged by informal
comments from retailers indicating that players are redeeming more
winning instant tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the kinds of things that show us, from this side of
the fence looking at numbers, what is really happening out in the
field,'' Cloud said.

   SRINAGAR, Kashmir _ Sadly, alarmingly, endlessly, there is
trouble in paradise. The Vale of Kashmir, once exalted for the
lotus blooms in its lakes and the yellow tapestry of its mustard
fields, has become a valley of despair _ a place haunted by
senseless murder and hideous torture, wherever the famously sweet
winds blow.
</P>
<P>
   For a half century, India and Pakistan have fought over this
land, sustaining a hatred so venomous as to rival any in the world.
For each, possessing Kashmir is a matter of life and death, with
both persistently willing to forsake the former for the latter.
</P>
<P>
   A macabre carnival of killing has come to mock a once-storied
serenity as India suppresses a Pakistani-supported insurgency:
people blown apart, ambushed, caught in a crossfire, snatched and
disappeared. During the past decade, 24,000 have died by the Indian
government's official count. Others say 40,000 is a better
estimate. Others, 70,000.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Srinagar, the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir's summer
capital, life has assumed a quality of war-weary numbness and
morbid fatalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``If only we could turn back the clock,'' said Irfan Maqsood, a
21-year-old student, in a typical lament. ``The fighting goes on
and on, and for what? We belong to India, and India will never let
us go.''
</P>
<P>
   People have grown used to the street's stern accouterments.
Heavily armed soldiers or policemen are always within sight.
Bunkers are maintained every few blocks, their sandbags covered
with blue tarpaulin, rifle barrels peeping out of rectangular
slits. The police conduct dozens of ``cordon and search''
operations each day, surrounding a small area and then entering
homes and shops, rousting out the men and taking away suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Kashmir is caught in one of the world's violent loops, death
begetting death. A grenade is flung into the courtyard of a police
station. An hour later, in a crowded, airless hospital ward,
Mohammad Yusuf Mir, a wounded policeman strung to an IV, is
coupling his moans with an oath: ``Whoever did this, I hate them. I
curse them. I'll kill them.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebellion itself began 10 years ago. Weapons flooded in,
tourists scurried out. At first, the insurgency was home-grown.
Kashmiri youth, shouting azadi, or freedom, became guerrillas,
trying to send India packing with a few well-placed bombs and
high-profile kidnappings. Shopkeepers gave them cash. Mothers made
them sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   To New Delhi, this was a threat to its nationhood, to Islamabad
an opportunity to wage war by proxy. India has since tried to stamp
out the revolt with all the fury of an enraged elephant, while
Pakistan has tried to provoke the uprising further and arm it and
bend it to its will.
</P>
<P>
   Today, what is left in the valley is a populace stunned with
confusion and sorrow, unwilling to give up the dream of
independence and yet unprepared to endure more killing. People feel
betwixt and between, their fate out of their hands. A common
complaint is that India and Pakistan seem pitted against each other
in a fight to the death of the last Kashmiri.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to stand up and say to them both, `Thank you for
loving us, but spare us the honor of being your battleground,'''
said Muzafar Baig, a prominent lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Life seems forever transformed. A valley whose culture was once
identified with the gentle teachings of Sufi mystics is now
overwhelmed by the culture of the gun and the morality of the
mercenary. Insurgency and counterinsurgency have bled into one
another. Kashmir has become a place of double-crosses and extortion
and vaporous truths.
</P>
<P>
   Some days back, ``Papa Kishtwari,'' a man with hard eyes and
strong opinions, sat in his house sipping tea as a dozen or so
supplicants waited outside to tell him their troubles. His real
name is Ghulam Hassan Lone and he is one of the leaders of the
so-called ``friendlies,'' onetime insurgents who surrendered and
then switched sides, becoming India's eyes and ears against the
insurgents and sometimes its fists.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled his days as an anti-India militant. According to
him, Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency gave him money,
guns and marching orders. ``They told us what positions to hit,''
he said. ``They gave us a list of people to be shot dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he changed allegiance. The money was still good, the work
similar, he said. He would identify militants for the Indian
security forces. ``There is a policy of extra-judicial killings,''
he said, something India denies. ``This is done to impress New
Delhi.''
</P>
<P>
   But the days of the ``friendlies'' appear to be over. India has
changed tactics and relies more on its own intelligence units to
ferret out militants. ``Pakistan used us, then India used us,''
Papa Kishtwari said bitterly. ``This is what they do in Kashmir _
use us.''

CLINTON-HATER ISN'T A HAT THAT I WEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I keep getting these angry calls and letters from people
accusing me of hating Bill Clinton. Here's a news flash: I don't
hate Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I'm amazed and rather offended by the accusation of
Clinton-hating, since I have often taken issue with certified
Clinton-haters _ most notably during last year's presidential
sex-and-lies scandal, when I argued that Clinton should not be
removed from office as long as a majority of Americans wanted him
to finish his term.
</P>
<P>
   I'm of the opinion that the impeachment and removal of a
president is a political process that requires the support of the
American people. The people _ even including some who did not vote
for Clinton in 1996 _ made it perfectly clear that they did not
want to see the president of the United States driven from office
over the Monica Lewinsky business.
</P>
<P>
   Would I have preferred a Bob Dole victory in the 1996
presidential race? Absolutely. Do I think that Bill Clinton is a
dishonest and dishonorable individual who should never have been
elected in the first place? Absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is, I supported the guy the first time he ran. I
figured he had a good heart and some good ideas.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, I knew that President Bush might be right
when he said that Clinton couldn't be trusted; when he said that
the longtime governor of Arkansas would ``turn the White House into
the waffle house.''
</P>
<P>
   I was guessing that if Clinton turned out to be as awful as his
opponents predicted, the voters could send him packing in '96. As
it happened, Clinton was worse than his opponents predicted (in my
opinion), but the voters rewarded him with a second term.
</P>
<P>
   Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about the sex and lies. I've disagreed with Clinton's
policies on everything from health care to Kosovo. I don't believe
that he's responsible for the nation's booming economy, any more
than I would blame him if the economy were struggling. No
president, Democrat or Republican, controls the ups and downs of
America's remarkable free-market economic system.
</P>
<P>
   And, based on past performance, I just plain don't believe
anything that Clinton says.
</P>
<P>
   Add all that up and it means that I don't think he's a good
president and I don't think he's a trustworthy person. It doesn't
mean that I hate him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hate'' is a strong or meaningless word, depending on how it is
used. There are, I am sure, people who genuinely hate Bill Clinton.
They hate what he is, what he's done and not done, what they
believe he represents.
</P>
<P>
   Their feelings for Clinton are their business.
</P>
<P>
   And the same is true for those who believe that Clinton is the
greatest thing since sliced bread. Sing his praises, if you must.
Kiss the ground he walks on, if you feel the urge.
</P>
<P>
   But don't tell me that I have no right to criticize him.
</P>
<P>
   One of my favorite complaints from the Clintonites is: ``Don't
you have anything to write about except Bill Clinton? Why can't you
write about something else for a change?''
</P>
<P>
   There's a delicious irony in that one, because when I used to
write an occasional complimentary column about Clinton, his fans
were thrilled to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep up the good writing,'' they said. ``We need more columns
about our president.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that I mostly find fault with the president, however, the
feedback is more along the lines of the phone message I got last
week: ``I hate the way you write.''
</P>
<P>
   Look, folks. For better or worse, Clinton is president of the
United States. He is scrambling to build some sort of legacy that
might transcend the scandal of 1998, which means he constantly says
and does things that cry out to be evaluated by those of us who
make a living conjuring up opinions on matters of public policy.
</P>
<P>
   Believe this: If Clinton would resign the presidency and ride
off into the sunset, I'd stop writing about him the moment he
disappeared from view. But he clearly intends to finish his term,
which doesn't expire until January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   If he does something good before then, I'll be sure to mention
it.

 SRINAGAR, Kashmir: _ use us.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The History Since '47, a Puzzle Without a Solution
</P>
<P>
   Kashmir is one of the world's most confounding morasses, a
52-year-old custody battle where the contesting parties disagree on
the details of every scrap of their common history.
</P>
<P>
   The very term Kashmir is ambiguous. Most often, it is used as
shorthand for the entire Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, which
has about 8 million people.
</P>
<P>
   But the state has several distinct regions, of which the fabled
valley, with slightly more than half of the population, is but one.
Only there do people speak Kashmiri _ and only there do people have
a distinct feeling of being a separate nation, with a large Muslim
majority. Sparsely populated Ladakh is half Buddhist and half
Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   Once a princely state ruled by a maharajah, Jammu and Kashmir
had even broader boundaries, including territory now claimed by
Pakistan and China. In 1947, the year that India and Pakistan were
born, the departing British colonial masters demanded that the
subcontinent's 562 landed maharajahs opt to belong to one infant
nation or the other.
</P>
<P>
   Hari Singh, the state's Hindu maharajah, dithered past the
deadline, but then, as tribesmen from Pakistan's northern frontier
aided a local rebellion, he decided to cast the lot of his
predominantly Muslim domain with predominantly Hindu India.
</P>
<P>
   To many Muslims, it seemed the land had fallen under the thumb
of the infidel. War broke out between India and Pakistan, and an
ensuing cease-fire left about one-third of the densely populated
part of the state with Pakistan, where it remains today.
</P>
<P>
   Jammu and Kashmir, while never happily a part of India,
nevertheless lived in relative peace until the rebellion.
Statewide, between Jan. 1, 1990, and July 15, 1999, the state
police recorded 7,922 attacks with explosives, 9,393 random
firings, 12,460 ``cross firings,'' 3,553 abductions, 619 rocket
attacks. The years 1993 through 1996 were the worst.
</P>
<P>
   During the past few years, the mayhem had actually moderated.
Death tolls were nearly halved, curfews in Srinagar were lifted.
Indeed, this spring some 100,000 tourists _ mostly Indians _
visited Kashmir. Dal Lake was again busy with colorful boats, the
oarsmen gently paddling while visitors delighted in the graceful
swoop of a kingfisher.
</P>
<P>
   But then in late May came ``Kargil,'' the convenient term given
to 10 weeks of fighting along snow-capped peaks in Kashmir.
Pakistani-supported militants _ New Delhi contends they were mostly
Pakistani soldiers _ sneaked into India and seized the high ground
above a vital supply route. India responded with air power and a
vast deployment, with both sides finally braking at the brink of
what would have been their fourth all-out war.
</P>
<P>
   As the Kargil battleground, named for a town in central Kashmir,
calmed down, hit-and-run tactics picked up throughout the entire
state. More than 1,000 militants have recently crossed into
Kashmir, making a total force of about 3,500 insurgents, Indian
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new ones are better-armed and better-trained than we're
used to,'' said Gurbachan Jagat, the state police chief. ``They're
professionals, with good radios and heavy explosives.''
</P>
<P>
   The character of the insurgency has been steadily changing, too.
</P>
<P>
   According to Indian military observers, about 40 percent of the
militants are now foreigners, mostly Pakistanis but also Afghans.
They belong to various groups _ with varying political and
religious beliefs _ but a few of the most powerful, like
Lashkar-e-Taiba, are Islamic fundamentalists who have come to
Kashmir on a holy war.
</P>
<P>
   While the Vale of Kashmir is overwhelmingly Muslim, a less
dogmatic version of the faith is commonly practiced here, and
Kashmiri nationalism has never been equated with religion. To some
then, it seems the fight for independence has taken odd turns and
attracted strange confederates.
</P>
<P>
   Yasin Malik, a chain-smoking, gangling 33-year-old, is head of
the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front, the most important group
among the rebels. Since 1994, it has abided by a self-proclaimed
cease-fire, but it does not condemn anti-India violence by others,
anything to keep the pot stirring. Still, Mr. Malik has regrets:
``It is too bad that when Lashkar-e-Taiba speaks, people believe
this is the voice of the Kashmiri people.''
</P>
<P>
   The active guerrilla groups are not united in any single
military strategy, though they now often avoid the concentration of
Indian security forces in the valley and operate in the thick
forests and isolated villages of Jammu. One tactic is to massacre
Hindu innocents, hoping to set off communal violence. Another is
political assassination. Another involves bold rocket attacks
against army installations.
</P>
<P>
   New Delhi continues to use a heavy club to fight back, something
that has repeatedly drawn condemnations from international human
rights groups. From the Indian government's vantage point, however,
the nation deserves to be commended for restraint.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've kept our response low-key and measured,'' said Gov.
Girish Saxena, New Delhi's man in Srinagar. ``We did not use tanks
and armed personnel carriers. We have generally confined our
response to small arms, and that has made an impression on people
that we are trying to deal with the situation in a civilized way.''
</P>
<P>
   India maintains about 200,000 regular army troops in Kashmir,
most of them warily guarding against a Pakistani attack. Fighting
the guerrillas is now largely left to 125,000 others from
paramilitary units and the state police, Saxena said. Additionally,
the state has armed 18,000 villagers _ mostly Hindus in Jammu _ to
defend themselves. They call them village defense committees.
</P>
<P>
   That is a lot of firepower _ and its presence fuels the
continued reproach of rights groups. It is not difficult to locate
men with convincing tales of recent torture, ugly engravings on
their skin, a palette of black and blue on their limbs. Parents
wait by the gates of army camps and police stations, holding photos
of sons who have been taken into custody and never seen again.
</P>
<P>
   Bystanders are too often mistaken for perpetrators, said Raja
Banoo, whose 16-year-old son has been gone for 28 months. ``Before
the army took him, they beat him right in front of me and dug a
hole and said, `We'll bury your son alive,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The state government opened its own human rights commission in
August 1997, but it is widely regarded as toothless.

<P>
   By and large, the state police have been entrusted to look into
rights abuses. Their records show a total of 3,197 complaints,
including allegations of 1,105 ``custodial deaths,'' 1,248
``innocent killings'' and 512 ``disappearances.''
</P>
<P>
   Of these cases, barely 3 to 4 percent seem to ``merit any
follow-up,'' said R. Tikoo, the assistant director general of the
central intelligence division.

<P>
   The Future: Could Clinton Act As Peacemaker?
</P>
<P>
   A common sentiment heard in Kashmir comes out as a question: Why
isn't the world paying more attention? And if there is a silver
lining to the Kargil episode, it is that for a time the world did _
and may still. With India and Pakistan now nuclear powers,
hostilities between them have apocalyptic potential. A turning
point in the crisis came after Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif met with President Clinton in Washington on July 4.
</P>
<P>
   This may be grasping at straws, but many here are putting
considerable hope in a two-word pledge issued after the
Clinton-Sharif meeting. The president agreed to take a ``personal
interest'' in urging the resumption of Indian-Pakistani peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
   How personally he will be involved, and how interested he truly
is, is uncertain. America's position remains that Kashmir is a
disputed territory, and a solution is best left to bilateral talks
between the two nations. That would be fine with India, which
considers Kashmir to be an open-and-shut case and officially
refuses to acknowledge that a dispute even exists.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kashmiris are encouraged. Shahid-ul-Islam, a former
guerrilla commander from the group Hezbollah Mujahedeen, said: ``We
take a positive sign from Kosovo. We had thought Mr. Clinton was
anti-Muslim, but now we believe he may be an angel for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdul Ghani Bhat, a professor and head of the Muslim Conference
political party, said: ``The president of America wants to go down
in the annals of history as a peacemaker. That is why he said
`personal interest.' He will force India to negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hopes to visit the subcontinent early next year _ and
certainly the issue of Kashmir will come up. It has poisoned the
relations between two poor countries with a combined population of
1.1 billion _ nearly a fifth of all humanity.
</P>
<P>
   But if the president forcefully enters the Kashmir fray, he will
find himself wandering within that 52-year-old morass, which has so
defiantly resisted solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Twice, back in 1948 and 1949, India committed itself to a
U.N.-sponsored plebiscite, allowing the state's people to decide
whether to be part of it or Pakistan. This vote, however, was made
to be contingent on a pullback of armed forces by both sides, an
exercise requiring trust. The vote has yet to occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``That referendum must be held and we would abide by the
decision, but the choices must include independence,'' said Malik
of the Liberation Front.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But the results of any statewide vote _ even one with three
choices _ is likely to leave as many people dissatisfied as there
are now. Ladakh and parts of Jammu would want to stay with India,
parts of Jammu would prefer Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with that prospect, a half century of thinking has
yielded any number of options, including joint sovereignty
arrangements and ways of dividing up the state between India and
Pakistan and allowing the valley to become independent. Regional
plebiscites, instead of a statewide one, is another suggestion
frequently made.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But nothing will happen unless all parties are willing to
negotiate and compromise. ``President Clinton could get everyone to
talk, don't you think?'' said Abdul Majid Wani, a retired engineer
who was walking in a cemetery called Martyr's Graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   His son is buried there. Ashfaq Majeed Wani, one of the first
young men to take up arms against India, was killed on March 30,
1990. He was 23, and when his father identified the body, he
counted 21 bullet holes. Ashfaq was also missing several fingers,
and the elder Wani proudly speculated that his son died with a
grenade in hand.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 1,000 simple graves in the cemetery, which
is beside a soccer field. Wani conducted a brief tour, pausing at
one marker or another to describe more death. At the end of one row
rested a 4-year-old, Master Shaheed Yawar, killed in a crossfire.
Wani did not want the poetics on a nearby sign to be missed.
</P>
<P>
   It said: ``Do not shun the gun, my dear younger ones. The war
for freedom is yet to be won.''

 &HT;    Down markets important test for funds
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With more than 5,000 mutual funds to pick from, how
can anyone find the right one? Never mind those ``10 hot funds to
buy now'' lists, says Forbes (Aug. 23). Look at how well a fund has
performed in bad markets as well as in good.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's honor roll of mutual funds that have ``lived
through downs as well as ups'' is topped by the Janus Fund, which
posted an average annual return of 18.5 percent _ before deductions
for loads and taxes _ between Aug. 31, 1987, and June 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Other top five funds are Vanguard 500 Index, 15.7 percent
average annual return; AXP New Dimension-A, 17.3 percent; Gabelli
Asset Fund, 16.1 percent; and Dreyfus Appreciation Fund, 14.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine (September)
reminds investors that mutual funds aren't free. A big expense is
the cost of trading, which means that funds that engage in
excessive buying and selling of stocks also pay lots of broker
commissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``A new study by Barra Inc., a financial research firm in
Berkeley, Calif., found that trading costs retard funds' returns,
and by far more than almost anyone had imagined,'' the magazine
says. It's important since the fund buyer eventually pays them.
</P>
<P>
   Barra found that funds that trade frequently have trading costs
of about 2 percent. Index funds, which do not trade as often, are
the cheapest, with trading costs of less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Worth (September), meanwhile, warns investors that the three
bears stalking the U.S. Goldilocks economy are the Federal Reserve,
China and the Year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed is likely to raise interest rates again, China threatens
to worsen the Asian crisis by devaluing its currency, and the Y2K
computer problem could have widespread effects.
</P>
<P>
   None of the three bears is likely to be ferocious enough to
derail the economy, Worth says, ``but together they will be enough
to keep the stock market on edge for at least the remainder of
1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Worth mentioning ...
</P>
<P>
   _ Business Week (Aug. 16) cites Atlanta's recent day-trader
murders in a cover profile of gun makers, an industry ``under
fire.'' It is a diverse group including ``true-blue American brand
names'' such as Smith &AMP; Wesson and Colt.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stock options have made lots of company bosses incredibly
rich, especially in the United States. Shareholders have gotten
richer, too. But The Economist (Aug. 13) says options have some
long-range disadvantages, such as diluting a firm's existing
equity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two Atlanta-based companies make the Individual Investor
(September) 1999 list of 100 ``fastest-growing companies.'' They
are InfoCure, whose software is used by doctors to manage their
offices, and MindSpring Enterprises, an Internet service provider.

 &HT;    CheckFree confirms Yahoo! deal
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ CheckFree confirmed Wednesday that it has reached an
agreement with Yahoo! _ one of the Internet's best known sites _
allowing its payment processing services to be seen by up to 37
million visitors a month.
</P>
<P>
   The Yahoo! deal, analysts believe, will be a big one for
CheckFree, a Norcross company that still is mostly a processor of
electronic payments. But CheckFree is moving toward the Internet,
leading the pack of companies hoping to make it the place where
people get and pay their bills. The prospects of a deal with Yahoo!
had been reported in January, but official confirmation did not
come until now.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 12 million payments CheckFree processed in June, about
13,000 were through the Internet. The number of CheckFree customers
who pay bills via the Internet is growing 20 percent per quarter,
faster than overall customer growth, which is 6 percent per
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   CheckFree says 29 of its customers send bills over the Internet.
Twenty-one more are implementing the service, said Pete Kight,
CheckFree chairman and chief executive. During a conference call to
discuss quarterly earnings with investors, Kight said Yahoo! is
testing a process to let people get and pay their bills at its site
(www.yahoo.com), one of the Web's most visited. He said he expects
the service to be available to the public by the end of September.
</P>
<P>
   ``The portals will prove to be very valuable distribution
partners,'' said Kight.
</P>
<P>
   A Yahoo! spokeswoman declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   CheckFree shares rose 10.7 percent Wednesday to close at $26.43
1/4. After hitting a 52-week high of $69.12 1/2 on April 14,
CheckFree dropped 65 percent, closing Tuesday at $23.87 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Olson, an analyst with Pacific Growth Equities, said he
did not think the Yahoo! deal was the reason for the climbing share
prices. He said the company performed as expected and still has a
solid hold on its market.
</P>
<P>
   Olson said the Yahoo deal ultimately will be huge for CheckFree,
but it will be phased in over several months. CheckFree processes
bills for 3 million subscribers. This time next year, with the
Yahoo! site fully running, Kight said he hopes to have 5 million
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story gets real exciting when subscriber growth gets back
into double digits, and I think the Yahoo! deal has the chance to
do that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Olson said CheckFree will need the extra subscribers to pay for
the $50 million it is spending to market its services, develop
products and beef up its staff. CheckFree is building two customer
service centers, one in Dublin, Ohio, and one in Phoenix, Ariz.,
designed to handle the expected increase in customers, Kight said.
</P>
<P>
   Olson has a ``buy'' rating on CheckFree. He expects the stock to
be trading at $65 within 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Among the unanswered questions facing companies such as
CheckFree is where on the Net consumers will choose to pay their
bills _ whether they'll select sites like Yahoo! or go directly to
a biller's Web site or to a bank's. Wells Fargo, First Union and
Chase Manhattan are trying to develop an online bill delivery and
bill payment process to its customers.

ANNAN DECLARES U.N. PEACEKEEPERS SUBJECT TO GENEVA CONVENTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Overriding objections from a number of
countries that contribute peacekeeping troops to the United
Nations, Secretary-General Kofi Annan has ordered that all forces
operating under U.N. command abide by international laws protecting
civilians and governing the conduct of soldiers in war.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, U.N. peacekeepers have operated in a gray area of
international law, not strictly accountable to the Geneva
Conventions established 50 years ago this week, which set standards
of behavior for combatants. Only representatives of countries, not
of international organizations, signed those documents. Individual
commanders in peacekeeping operations, drawn from many countries,
have been expected to enforce good behavior, and troops were
supposed to be tried for infractions by their home governments.
</P>
<P>
   This system more or less worked in traditional operations after
cease-fires were reached. But in this decade, peacekeeping troops,
which are supposed to be neutral, began to be entangled in vicious
civil wars that turned even peacekeeping into a violent
free-for-all at times. Annan, who directed the U.N. Department of
Peacekeeping Operations before becoming secretary-general in 1997,
has been concerned about this trend since the mid-1990s, his aides
said.

   The secretary-general's directive, issued Tuesday in effect as
an executive order to all member nations, responds to reports of
serious human rights violations by peacekeepers in the Balkans,
Africa, Cambodia and elsewhere. Some of the most publicized cases,
involved Belgian, Canadian and Italian troops in Somalia from 1993
to 1995. But many U.N. operations have drawn accusations of theft,
rape, torture and other abuses against citizens who may have
already suffered at the hands of local combatants.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Under the new rules, vandalism, including at archaeological
sites and places of worship is forbidden, along with pilfering food
or drinking water from local populations. Women are afforded
special protection and the right to be separated from men and
supervised by other women if they are detained. The dead and
wounded left on battlefields are to be identified and the wounded
assisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is forbidden to order that there will be no survivors,''
the directive says.
</P>
<P>
   Land mines, booby traps and other weapons of indiscriminate
destruction are prohibited. ``Cruel treatment such as torture,
mutilation or any form of corporal punishment, collective
punishment'' are outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general's directive does not try to give the
United Nations the power to deal with infractions, which are to be
handled by national courts. A senior official said that the
organization would make adherence to the laws part of the agreement
drawn up with troop contributors, and would also ask governments to
report on how they have dealt with offending soldiers. There has
been a mixed record so far on punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Belgium tried and convicted soldiers for torturing Somalis, in
one incident by making young men eat pork _ which is taboo for
Muslims _ and drink vomit and eat worms. In Italy several
high-ranking officers resigned after a magazine printed pictures of
Italian troops torturing a Somali and raping a girl. Canada
disbanded a unit whose soldiers were responsible for the beating
death of a teen-age thief and the shooting of other civilians.
</P>
<P>
   But Pakistani peacekeepers accused of abuses in Somalia were not
tried. Troops from several African and European countries got away
with forced prostitution and theft in Mozambique and Cambodia, and
Rwandans accused West African peacekeepers serving in their country
of sexual abuses and acts of vandalism that were never punished.
</P>
<P>
   Some human rights advocates say that relying on the countries
involved to mete out punishment may be a vain hope. Some nations
are already threatening to withhold troops from U.N. operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is an important statement for the U.N. to
acknowledge on the 50th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions that
its forces will be bound by the basic principles of humanitarian
law, that they will observe the basic rules designed to protect
soldiers and civilians alike from the excesses of war,'' said
Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. But he said
that the provision giving national courts jurisdiction ``falls
short of current humanitarian law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't require that offenders be prosecuted,'' he said.
``Second, it limits prosecution to the courts of the offender's
nationality, whereas the Geneva Conventions explicitly empower
state parties to prosecute offenders whether or not the accused is
a member of that state. Third, it utterly ignores the International
Criminal Court, which is the obvious forum to prosecute
peacekeepers if the national courts refuse to prosecute. Within two
or three years, this court will exist.''
</P>
<P>
   The new rules were drawn up with the International Committee of
the Red Cross, an independent international organization that works
extensively in war zones and among prisoners. The wording follows
the rules of war set out in the four Geneva Conventions, and Annan
timed his directive to go into effect Thursday to mark Aug. 12,
1949, the day the conventions were signed. The secretary-general
will be in Geneva to commemorate the anniversary.

YELTSIN LEAVES TRAIL LITTERED WITH CHOSEN ONES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris N. Yeltsin has said he wants to see the
acting prime minister, Vladimir Putin, as Russia's next leader.
Ordinary Russians are not exactly rushing out to buy ``Vote for
Putin'' bumper stickers.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has named a lot of people his heir apparent over the
years. At the moment, none of them has a ghost of a chance to be
Russia's next president.
</P>
<P>
   Being ordained as Yeltsin's successor, either by the president
himself or Moscow's manic rumor machine, has turned out to be a
political kiss of death.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about who will succeed Yeltsin, who legally must
leave office in July, has heated up as the Russian president enters
his final year in office. It began, however, almost as soon as
Yeltsin took up residence in the Kremlin in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   And every heir to Yeltsin's Kremlin throne, sooner or later, has
been cast into the political wilderness, usually by the mercurial
president himself. One reason: Yeltsin jealously guards the
prerogatives of his office and can't tolerate popular competitors,
even when they are of his own making.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers say Yeltsin's longtime prime minister, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, once seen as a likely successor, was sacked last year
for acting too presidential. The same was said about former prime
minister Sergei Stepashin, who was fired Monday and replaced by
Putin. Stepashin's recent visit to the United States, where he
secured badly needed credits for Russia, was widely and favorably
covered here, and the Russian media began touting him as
presidential material.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeltsin does not have long-lived favorites,'' former deputy
prime minister Boris Nemtsov said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He should know. In 1994, Nemtsov was governor of the Nizhny
Novgorod region on the Volga River when Yeltsin bestowed upon him
an unambiguous presidential endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has grown so much that you can already tap him for
president,'' said Yeltsin of Nemtsov, then 34.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin brought Nemtsov into his Cabinet in March 1997, saying
that Russia needed ``young energetic leaders.'' Nemtsov's poll
numbers immediately soared and pundits proclaimed him the country's
next president. Just 17 months later, Nemtsov was a private
citizen, fired by Yeltsin after Russia's debt default and ruble
devaluation last August. Today Nemtsov's popularity is, like
Yeltsin's, in single digits, and nobody considers him a serious
presidential contender.
</P>
<P>
   Nemtsov can take comfort in the fact that he is not alone.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1996, Yeltsin appointed retired general Alexander Lebed,
who was then widely popular, as his national security adviser.
Asked at a Kremlin ceremony whether Lebed was his chosen successor,
Yeltsin replied: ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lebed won praise for negotiating a cease-fire in Russia's
20-month war with the breakaway republic of Chechnya. But he also
made the mistake of taking Yeltsin's presidential endorsement too
seriously. Asked by reporters whether he wanted to be president in
2000, Lebed smiled and said, ``Maybe earlier.'' After four months
in office, Lebed was sacked by Yeltsin. And despite his election
last year as governor of the Siberian region of Krasnoyarsk, talk
of ``President Lebed'' has all but ceased.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those whom Yeltsin once called his successor have no
political future now,'' said Gennady Seleznyov, speaker of the
State Duma, the lower house of Russia's parliament. Seleznyov added
that by anointing Putin, Yeltsin had ``put a hex'' on him.
</P>
<P>
   Seleznyov has a point. Over the years, Yeltsin's heirs apparent
have included a bunch of people Russians have long forgotten and
most of the rest of the world has never known: Sergei Shakhrai,
Vladimir Shumeiko, Oleg Soskovets. At times, the succession
speculation has bordered on the absurd.
</P>
<P>
   Shakhrai, who in the early 1990s served as deputy prime
minister, was once the media's favorite president in waiting. But
Yeltsin put an end to the diminutive Shakhrai's hopes when he
announced that his successor had to be ``a tall person.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a requirement that does not bode well for Putin, who is a
full head shorter than Yeltsin.

BUSH ACCUSES U.S. OF LAX ENFORCEMENT OF GUN LAWS IN WAKE OF
SHOOTINGS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ Responding to the shooting at a suburban Los
Angeles Jewish community center, Republican presidential candidate
George W. Bush accused the Clinton administration Wednesday of lax
enforcement of the nation's gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``This current administration has not done a good job of
prosecuting gun laws,'' Bush said. ``In my judgment, if we can keep
guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them and
prosecute people who sell guns illegally, we will have done society
a great service.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush noted that the accused Los Angeles shooter had been
convicted of a felony but had not turned himself in to serve his
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had been brought to justice in a firm way, he wouldn't
have been where he was,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bush said he was not specifically blaming either
President Clinton or Vice President Al Gore for allowing Tuesday's
shooting to occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not. You can't blame any single person for the acts
of a mad man, acts of people who have evil in their hearts,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr., a white supremacist with ties to hate
groups in the Northwest, shot five people, including a 5-year-old
boy, in Tuesday's attack at the North Valley Jewish Community
Center. Furrow, 37, also will be charged in the slaying of a postal
worker who was shot near the community center.
</P>
<P>
   As he did after the high school shootings in Colorado and
Georgia, Bush said there is no need for massive new gun control
laws. But he said he favors instant background checks to make sure
gun buyers are legally eligible to own a gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to make sure that people who should not have
guns don't have guns; that is, the young (and) felons,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor also said he is for maintaining bans on
assault weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to enforce the ban against assault weapons. It makes
no senses for assault weapons to be around our society,'' Bush
said. ``I strongly support the ban on assault weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress banned the sale of assault weapons in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was in Oklahoma City on Wednesday for a fund-raiser at the
National Cowboy Hall of Fame and to tour by Big Bass, Big Bucks
Charities youth fishing program at Crystal Lake.
</P>
<P>
   While at Crystal Lake, Bush proposed an overhaul of the
long-standing, successful Head Start preschool program.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the initiatives of my education initiative is going to
be to totally rehaul and revamp the Head Start program, changing it
from a program where children are collected just to sit around to a
program that begins the education process so every child has a
chance to succeed,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wants to use Head Start to make certain children
receive the basics in reading and math. But Bush offered no
specifics on how that would be accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Bush praised the Crystal Lake project as an example of mentoring
programs in which local citizens join with government to provide a
good foundation for children. He said cases such as this year's
Littleton, Colo., high school shootings might be avoided with such
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take more than man-made law to help these kids
who have gone astray. That's why faith-based programs are
important,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush described the Crystal Lake program as one that receives
state help, ``some federal help, a lot of private help to change
people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The $3 million project actually receives three-fourths of its
money from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hartman, a professional fisherman who is president of the
charity, said most of the funding comes from a tax on sporting
equipment. He said the charity runs the lake for Oklahoma City
government and teaches children of all socio-economic groups about
fishing and the outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   During Bush's visit, about 150 inner-city children sponsored by
the local food bank were catching catfish on the 64-acre lake.
</P>

$44.6M BREAK UP FEE INCLUDED IN EMC-DATA GENERAL DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now it can be told: Dragon might have to pay Emerald a breakup
fee of $44.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The code names refer to Data General Corp. and EMC Corp.,
respectively; the terms and the fee were among the details the two
computer giants Wednesday disclosed about EMC's proposed $1.05
billion stock purchase of Data General.
</P>
<P>
   The codes were used during secret negotiations before the two
companies announced their deal on Monday, spokesmen said.
</P>
<P>
   In filings to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the
companies also said that should a rival suitor emerge and
successfully bid on Data General, the Westborough, Mass. firm would
have to pay data-storage giant EMC Corp. a breakup fee of $44.6
million, or about 4 percent of the deal's total value.
</P>
<P>
   EMC, of Hopkinton, Mass., plans to buy Data General in order to
increase the range of data-storage products it sells to
medium-sized business customers.
</P>
<P>
   But the price was less than Data General's revenue last year of
$1.46 billion, leading some analysts to wonder whether another
major data-storage company such as Hewlett-Packard Co. or Sun
Microsystems might make a counter offer.
</P>
<P>
   Data General vice president Ray Thomas said Wednesday no other
parties have expressed interest in topping EMC's bid.
</P>
<P>
   The filings also showed that EMC will be permitted to buy up to
19.9 percent of Data General's roughly 50 million common shares on
the open market before the merger is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Should EMC do so and then lose a bidding war for Data General,
its gains from the breakup fee and from stock purchases would be
capped at $61.4 million, according to the filings.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is structured as an issuance of 0.3265 of an EMC share
for each outstanding share of Data General.
</P>
<P>
   However, according to the filings, the exchange ratio would be
adjusted if EMC shares climb above 66 1/16 _ meaning the total
value of the agreement would be no greater than $1.22 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The companies plan to complete the merger this year, pending
approvals from regulators and shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in EMC rose 5 1/4 to close at 58 7/8 in New York Stock
Exchange trading Wednesday. Shares in Data General rose 1 5/16 to
close at 18 1/16.

LYCOS TO PAY WEB SITE OWNERS WHO INSTALL ICONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lycos Inc. will use an old tactic to gain visibility for its
Internet services: payoffs.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Waltham, Mass. search engine company said it will
begin paying individuals who install Lycos search icons on their
own Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Users will receive two or three cents each time third-party
visitors click on the icons to launch Lycos searches over the rest
of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The program, known as ``affiliate marketing,'' mimics an idea
that became popular on many business Web sites several years ago to
draw in traffic from other business sites.
</P>
<P>
   But only recently has such marketing begun to catch on at the
consumer level, most notably with an effort by the big Seattle
on-line retailer Amazon.com, which recently began a similar
affiliate marketing program.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos executives said they think the payments could help their
service catch up to larger rival portal companies such as Yahoo
Inc. ``This gives us more of an opportunity for exposure,'' said
Lycos product manager Michael Genstil.
</P>
<P>
   Genstil declined to discuss how many users he hopes might
install the icons or how the payments might affect Lycos revenue or
total traffic. Dawn Simon, analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman in
New York, said she doubted it would have a big impact on earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The program comes as Lycos tries to draw attention to the
various brands it operates. In addition to its basic search engine,
Lycos operates one known as HotBot, and will provide software so
individuals can begin HotBot searches on their own pages. Under the
affiliate program, Lycos will pay users who host the icon 2 cents
per HotBot search.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Lycos will pay 3 cents for each search launched
from other links it will make available, to access
television-program lists, sports scores, and political news, among
other topics.
</P>
<P>
   In June, sites affiliated with Lycos were the fourth-most
popular network on the Web, receiving 29.9 million visitors,
according to the New York firm Media Metrix.
</P>
<P>
   America Online Inc. was first with 47.1 million visitors,
followed by Yahoo Inc. with 37.1 million visitors, and sites
affiliated with Microsoft Corp. with 32.9 million.

JAPAN'S OUTDATED LABOR RULES ARE WORKING AGAINST TEMPORARY
EMPLOYEES 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Fed up with the long hours of overtime that her
publishing company insisted she work, Yoshiko Kitani quit a secure
job seven years ago, then spent a year traveling around Japan,
getting to know her country for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, the 30 year-old trade school graduate from Yokohama
has hopped easily from job to job, hiring herself out through
temporary agencies instead of casting her lot with a single
employer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began to think that when I get older, if anyone ever asked
me what I had done with my life, all I could tell them about was
work,'' she said. ``I just decided that that would have been a big
waste, so I broke free.''
</P>
<P>
   By going back to school to freshen up her computer skills, Miss
Kitani said she has always been able to find basic administrative
work whenever she needed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I quit one job, I always tell the temporary agency that
I'm in the market for another one,'' she said. ``There are always
jobs opening up, and when a new one becomes available, I switch.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers like Miss Kitani represent the future of the job market
in this country. And like much that is cutting edge at the turn of
the century, it is a future that a crisis-stricken government is
being dragged toward with its heels planted firmly in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years of serious decline in Japan's economic prospects,
the longtime ideal of lifetime employment is becoming an
unattainable dream for all but a shrinking core of workers.
</P>
<P>
   For over a million Japanese, the snug job security of the past
has been rudely replaced by unemployment. Still, for millions of
others, a new way of life that involves job-hopping, temporary- and
part-time work is quickly taking its place.
</P>
<P>
   Though Japan does not keep statistics on the number of temporary
workers, their growing popularity is widely reported by workers
themselves, corporate executives, government officials and
entrepreneurs in the hot new job placement business.
</P>
<P>
   At Japan's leading job placement company, Pasona, executives
report that in less than a decade, the number of requests for
temporary workers has soared from 100,000 to one million a year.
Government bureaucrats report pressure from workers and companies
to ease rules that now restrict job mobility and the temporary
employment agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese workers seem willing to quit jobs when they are feel
they are underpaid or just bored, even at the risk of becoming
unemployed for a time. And increasingly, they are resorting to
private job placement agencies to find new work. But with
unemployment approaching 5 percent _ a postwar record _ the
government has been slow to adapt to this changing scene, and has
only grudgingly begun removing the restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of encouraging bloated companies to restructure, and
making it easier for people to change jobs, the government's
response has been to pay subsidies to companies to hold onto their
workers, even when their positions are no longer needed.
</P>
<P>
   That reluctance reflects a long-held belief that companies are
morally obligated to provide for their employees, even by giving
them make-work jobs rather than laying them off. But Japan's long
economic recession, pressures on companies to become more
efficient, and a growing desire on the part of some Japanese
workers for flexibility and mobility are eroding these beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public has been expressing more interest in temporary
work, and so have the employers, so we are beginning to lift
restrictions on this sector,'' said Masaki Iuchi, a senior labor
ministry official. ``In the past we have always tried to remain in
step with the rules of the International Labor Organization.''
</P>
<P>
   But government officials do not seem to feel any particular
sense of urgency. Last year only about one third of Japan's college
graduates were able to find full-time employment. And yet temporary
agencies are still forbidden from securing work for anyone within a
year of graduation.
</P>
<P>
   Other rules establish mandatory fee schedules, inhibiting
competition among job agencies, or place a number of job categories
off-limits to temporary employment agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Most galling to employees who might want to use temporary jobs
as a steppingstone to permanent ones, the rules limit temporary
workers to one-year contracts, and prevent their immediate re-hire
for the same job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The granting of money to companies to keep workers on the
payroll does nothing to encourage fundamental change,'' said
Yasuyuki Nambu, the founder of Pasona, the job placement agency.
``They are behaving just as someone does when he has a cold:
treating the symptoms but doing nothing about the underlying
infection.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nambu, 47, an outspoken maverick who ranks among Japan's most
successful younger entrepreneurs, said that the problem is that
workers and businesses alike are kept in a ``regulatory cage'' by
the government. ``What we need more of in Japan is the
wilderness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many foreign economists agree with this diagnosis, and say that
the preoccupation with preserving what exists, whether industries
or individual jobs, in a deeply conservative Japan has become a
suffocating obstacle to economic regeneration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without more labor-market liquidity, which would shift human
resources into more productive industries, Japan will not
experience the kind of recovery in productivity, which must be the
foundation of any new growth path for the country,'' said Andrew
Shipley, senior economist at Schroeders Japan Ltd., an investment
bank.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Miss Kitani has little use for the economic
theories used to criticize or justify government policies. Her
observations of the regulations are fueled by the experiences of
someone who, like millions of other Japanese people, commutes for
nearly two hours a day from a bedroom suburb to a job in central
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Over 10 months into her contract in a job that she says she
enjoys, she is already making preparations to leave the company and
look for new work once more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really too bad that I can't keep the job I have now,''
she said, speaking of her work in a job preparing manuals for
engineers. ``In a job like this it takes a certain time to learn
the programs and to get a feel for what you are doing. But by the
time you feel you know what you are doing, because the rules are
the way they are, your time is up.''

`TRAIN' KEEPS A-ROLLIN'

<TEXT>
<P>
   On the liner notes to his third and best CD, the new ``Wild,
Free and Reckless,'' Wayne ``The Train'' Hancock addresses his
foes:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have only this to say to the self-righteous people in
Nashville who proclaim themselves to be music gods and the star
makers: I've got forty years of playing, writing and living to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Amen, brother. Based in Austin, and fond of loud Hawaiian shirts
as stagewear, Hancock is one of those guys for whom mainstream
Nashvegas has no time: He sounds ancient, as if he's been frozen
for 40 years and then thawed and dropped into the current
alt-country scene armed only with his guitar and memories of Hank,
Lefty and Ernest Tubb.
</P>
<P>
   And this is a very good thing. Plenty of guys can play at
reviving 40- to 50-year-old music, but most come off like imitators
and wannabes who have picked up some vocal nuances from CD
reissues.
</P>
<P>
   Not Hancock. On this CD, as with the first two ``(That's What
Daddy Wants'' and ``Thunderstorms and Neon Signs,)'' Hancock proves
himself a neo-traditionalist with a difference. He's throwing
together a variety of genres (honky-tonk, rockabilly, country, jazz
and a bit of swing) and stirring the pot with great original songs.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the casual but intense, swinging
last-set-in-a-roadhouse feel are marvelous solos by a supporting
cast that includes steel player Jeremy Wakefield, fiddler Erik
Hokkanen, pianist T Jarrod Bonta and trombonist Bob Stafford.
Hancock is extremely generous in the space he gives these men, and
others, and the reward is a studio CD that feels like a great
Saturday night out.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the songs are covers: Tubb's ``Kansas City Blues,''
Carl Perkins' ``Blue Suede Shoes'' and Bill Mack's ``It's Saturday
Night.'' The other 12 are Hancock originals, and they're every bit
as good, if not better. Hancock takes the usual country themes
(women, lack of women, highways) and plays with them, his voice
imbuing a sense of many miles traveled and many storms weathered.
</P>
<P>
   There's a whole cadre of young acts mixing and matching the
various honky-tonk musics of the '40s and '50s, including Ray
Condo, Big Sandy and the Fly Rite Boys, and the Dalhart Imperials.
With this CD, however, Wayne the Train heads to the front of the
class.

FAA ORDERS SUBSTITUTION OF INSULATION IN MANY JETLINERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an effort to reduce the risk of fires on airplanes, the
Federal Aviation Adminstration Wednesday ordered the replacement of
a type of insulation used on many of the nation's commercial
aircraft, a job expected to cost airlines at least $255 million.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 700 airplanes in the United States _ DC-10s, MD-11s,
MD-80s, MD-88s, and MD-90s _ are affected by the so-called
airworthiness directive, an FAA order that mandates action on the
part of aircraft owners and operators.
</P>
<P>
   The order stems directly from the Swissair Flight 111 accident
last Sept. 2 off the coast of Nova Scotia that killed all 229
people on board. The flight crew of the ill-fated MD-11 reported
smoke in the cockpit before the crash into the Atlantic as the
plane attempted to make an emergency landing in Halifax.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are examining electrical equipment near the
cockpit as the source of the fire and believe the metalized Mylar
blankets _ the insulation that the FAA Wednesday ordered taken out
of all aircraft at their next heavy maintenanace check or within
four years, whichever comes first _ helped spread the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the source of the ignition has yet to be determined,
there are indications that a significant source of the combustible
materials that sustained the fire was thermal acoustical insulation
blanket material,'' the Transportation Safety Board of Canada said
Wednesday.'' Burnt remnants of this material, quenched by the sea
water, were found in the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA order _ which will not be made permanent until after a
45-day comment period _ also comes as Canadian investigators
Wednesday issued recommendations calling not only for the removal
of metalized Mylar from airplanes, but also for more rigorous
testing of insulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shortcomings related to the in-service fire resistance of some
thermal acoustical insulation materials, and shortcomings in the
test criteria used to certify those materials, have been identified
during this and other recent aircraft occurence investigations,''
the Canadian safety board said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, FAA Administrator Jane F. Garvey said the agency
would develop a new test specification for insulation that would
result in increased fire safety on board airplanes. At that time,
officials said it was possible that widespread replacement of
insulation _ used to keep passengers warm and prevent exterior
noise, from engine whines to the roar of the air _ may be required.
</P>
<P>
   But using the new tests, which FAA officials believe meet the
Canadian recommendation, it was determined that metalized Mylar did
not retard fire. It actually helped spread fire.
</P>
<P>
   It was the only material tested to fail the new test by such a
significant margin, and therefore posed a risk to safety, FAA
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But neither the airlines, nor the airplane manufacturer has a
clear picture of how much metalized Mylar blankets is in individual
airplanes. As a result, replacing it _ without causing damage to
airplane components _ is a daunting and expensive task which could
cost anywhere from $400,000 to nearly $1 million per airplane.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA settled on the four-year time frame to remove the
material because airlines must identify which planes have the
material, then determine where it is located, said Beth Erickson,
director of the FAA's aircraft certification service. One airplane
may contain several different types of insulation; the same types
of airplanes may not have metalized Mylar in the same location.
</P>
<P>
   The metalized Mylar is like a thin pillowcase that wraps
fiberglass insulation, and is stitched or taped shut. Each piece is
cut to fit a specific part of an airplane, and on an MD-80, there
are some 1,400 different pieces that could be on the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines, Continental, Delta and Trans World Airlines
are the airlines most affected by the order, but several other
carriers also use some of the aircraft affected.
</P>
<P>
   John Meenan, senior vice president for industry policy with the
Air Transport Association, the trade association which represents
the major airlines, said the FAA order is ``puzzling because it
sets schedules before you have experience on how to proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   It will take until 2005 for all of the affected aircraft to go
through their next scheduled heavy maintenance check _ where the
plane is taken apart and rebuilt, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has never been done before,'' Meenan said. ``There is no
prototype on how to do it and avoid unintended damage to wire
bundles. We simply don't have experience with something like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Damaged wires can lead to arcing _ a potential ignition source
for onboard fires.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian officials said that on Sept. 6 1995, an MD-11 caught
fire while on the ground in China, and Chinese investigators found
molten metal from arcing wires which caused metalized Mylar to
ignite. And in November 1998 a Delta Airlines MD-11, which was
parked in Atlanta with no one on board, caught fire when a cargo
pallet caused circuitry to spark, igniting metalized Mylar
insulation.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the 699 affected airplanes in the US were built by
McDonnell Douglas Corp. which is now owned by Boeing. The order
does not affect foreign flag carriers, but FAA officials said
international regulatory agencies were involved in the recent
testing and expect those agencies to file similar directives.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing spokeswoman Lori Guntersaid the FAA order ``makes
mandatory what we did three years ago.'' In 1997, the company
issued a so-called service bulletin suggesting plane owners replace
metalized Mylar insulation with a different material during
maintenance overhauls. Company tests found that the Mylar was not
as fire retardant as other types of insulation, although Gunter
said it met FAA requirements at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the company used up its existing stock of the
insulation on planes in production after issuing the service
bulletin. None of its aircraft coming off production lines
currently has metalized Mylar.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If the New York Stock Exchange successfully converts
itself to a public corporation later this year, as it plans, the
owners of its 1,366 seats will get shares of the new company that
could ultimately be worth as much as several million dollars a
seat.
</P>
<P>
   If the American Stock Exchange, after the Big Board the nation's
second-largest auction market for stocks, follows suit, its 864
members will be legally entitled to _ nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The members sold their stake in the Amex last year when they
approved its acquisition by the National Association of Securities
Dealers, which also owns the Nasdaq stock market. In return, they
mostly got promises, including the critical assurance that the NASD
would make $110 million in overdue technology improvements that the
exchange could not afford on its own.
</P>
<P>
   The seat owners ``weren't thinking in terms of an IPO,'' said
John Sullivan of Charlotte, N.C., who leases out the Amex seat that
he owns. ``We were thinking in terms of survival. We needed that
infusion of capital. We needed that technology.'' An initial public
offering ``was a pie-in-the-sky notion at the time,'' he added.
``Our view was, first things first.''
</P>
<P>
   To appreciate the galloping uncertainty at the nation's stock
exchanges these days _ uncertainty that is driven by new
competitors, new technology and escalating investor demands _ one
need look no further than the desperate past and unpredictable
future of the American Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Just a year ago, the Amex seemed to face such daunting odds that
its members agreed to give up their ownership stake to gain access
to the money necessary to stay competitive. Today, other stock
markets around the world, including Nasdaq and the Big Board, are
betting that they can raise money by selling ownership stakes to
public investors.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Zarb, the chief executive of the NASD, says that within
the next two years even the long-struggling Amex _ the perennial
also-ran in the stock market sweepstakes _ could get a new lease on
life and fresh capital by being spun off as a publicly traded
company.
</P>
<P>
   But that optimistic vision assumes that the NASD can first
conquer the problems that had the exchange rushing into its arms in
the first place: outdated trading technology, a dearth of new
equity listings and an uncertain market niche. If the association
fails _ as some Amex members fear it will if core weaknesses in the
market's equity trading are not addressed quickly _ there may be
little for former seat owners to squabble over.
</P>
<P>
   By one measure, at least, the Amex is thriving. Seat prices have
increased by nearly 60 percent in the 17 months since the NASD deal
was announced, more than twice the percentage gain in the price of
Big Board seats during that time.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of listings has drifted relentlessly down, from
822 in January 1995 to 772 last January to just 761 recently. That
is barely a quarter of the number of Big Board listings and less
than a fifth the number of listings on Nasdaq. And the daily Amex
trading volume, valued at less than $300 billion, is utterly
dwarfed by the multitrillion-dollar price tag on each day's trading
at its two bigger rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The American Stock Exchange was born in the mid-19th century as
the New York Curb Market, a loose affiliation of brokers who
gathered outdoors in lower Manhattan to trade stocks that were not
listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Like the NYSE, the Amex is an ``auction market,'' where traders
gather on a central trading floor to bargain openly for shares of
each listed stock.
</P>
<P>
   From the first, the Amex was the home of stocks that did not yet
meet the stiffer financial standards for listing on the Big Board.
That remained its primary identity until the debut, in 1971, of the
Nasdaq market, a decentralized ``dealer market'' in which market
makers, linked by telephones and computer screens, buy from sellers
at one price and sell to buyers at a higher price, profiting on the
markup.
</P>
<P>
   The Amex tried to diversify. In 1975, it introduced trading in
stock options, and by the early 1980s options trading had become a
robust business. But by then its traditional stock-market business
was being increasingly eclipsed by Nasdaq, especially among the
technology companies that have become so important to the modern
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the Amex tried to supplement its lagging equity business
with creativity. In the early 1990s, it established a strong
presence in equity derivatives. Today, it conducts robust trading
in more than four dozen equity-linked products, from unit
investment trusts designed to track various Standard &AMP; Poor's
indexes to a new ``tracking stock'' that mimics the Nasdaq 100
index.
</P>
<P>
   But despite its successes _ it is the nation's second-ranking
options market, after the Chicago Board Options Exchange _ the Amex
remains heavily dependent on its equity trading business to pay its
bills. And by late 1997, that business was a chronic invalid, too
weak to generate the amounts of money the Amex would need to
upgrade electronic trading systems that were, by that point, as
much as a decade old.
</P>
<P>
   By early March 1998, leaders of the Amex were negotiating the
details of the NASD deal, which had a structure only Rube Goldberg
could love. The NASD set up a subsidiary holding company, which
controls a new limited liability company, Amex LLC, which acquired
the assets of the old American Stock Exchange from its members.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange members were granted certain rights, including
trading privileges, of course, and a voice in any major changes in
the trading structure on which their livelihoods depend. Members
also got a right of first refusal if the Amex LLC is ever put up
for sale, provided they can match the best competing offer.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the members were promised by the NASD that it
would invest up to $110 million in the exchange. That promise is
being kept in ways that will soon become obvious to everyone, said
Salvatore Sodano, the NASD chief financial officer, who has been
serving as acting president of the Amex.

REBEL BASAYEV A `CHE' TO HOMELAND, PUBLIC ENEMY TO MOSCOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ For some in his Caucasus homeland, Shamil Basayev is
the Chechen Che Guevara, liberator of the Muslim peoples of
southern Russia from the Kremlin that has dominated them since
Czarist times.
</P>
<P>
   For many Russians, however, Basayev is their own, private Osama
bin Laden _ terrorist, drug-runner, counterfeiter, kidnapper and
Public Enemy Number One.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday he emerged as the leader of Moscow's worst
headache-producing insurgency since he helped lead Chechnya's drive
to de-facto independence. He wasted no time in delivering an
ultimatum to his Russian foes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no force on Earth capable of stopping the Muslim
fighters other than the Almighty, who guides them on the road of
sacred war,'' Basayev, 34, told reporters who had been brought to
Basayev from Grozny, the Chechen capital.
</P>
<P>
   A former computer salesman whose daring, commando-style raids
helped drive the Russian army from Chechnya in 1996, Basayev was
named chief military commander by Islamic separatists fighting
federal troops in the southern Russia region of Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   While Russian leaders remained confident that their troops would
soon defeat the insurgents, Basayev's emergence as the leader of
the uprising lent new credibility to the militants' effort to
create an Islamic republic in Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mujaheddin will force Russia to leave Dagestan if they
don't do it on their own,'' the bearded Basayev, in battle
fatigues, told the reporters at an improvised news conference in
one of the villages captured by his men. ``We will fight until the
full victory of Islam in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Acting Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, a former intelligence
chief appointed head of Russia's government by President Boris N.
Yeltsin this week, Wednesday repeated his prediction of a quick
victory over the militants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are running like rabbits from one village to another so
its hard to say their number,'' said Putin, who met with
parliamentary leaders Wednesday to stump for support for his new
government. ``They are acting like cowards, and rarely enter into
battle with our troops.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials say they have inflicted heavy losses on the
rebels while 10 servicemen have been killed and 27 wounded since
the insurgents crossed into Dagestan from Chechnya on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo told reporters
federal troops had the militants surrounded and who ``destroy''
them in little time. Basayev, shown on Russian television driving
around in a blue pickup truck, countered that his men had two
Russian battalions surrounded in the mountainous region on the
border of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will either have to surrender or be destroyed,'' Basayev
said.
</P>
<P>
   Who's surrounding whom? The contradictory statements recall the
final days of the Chechen war, when Basayev led 1,500 guerrillas
into Grozny, surrounding a much larger and better-equipped federal
force and killing nearly 1,000 Russian soliders.
</P>
<P>
   Even while losing the Chechen capital, Russian commanders
insisted it was they who had Basayev surrounded. But in the end,
the balding guerrilla prevailed. Throughout the 1994-1996 Chechen
war, Basayev fashioned a legend out of his ability to win despite
uneven odds, which he underscored with his trademark combination of
bravado, dry wit and military genius.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1995, he led a bloody raid in which his men took 1,200
hostages and holed up in a maternity ward in the Russian town of
Budyonnovsk. More than 100 people were killed, but Basayev got away
after receiving a promise from Russian authorities of a cease-fire
in Chechnya. Later, he said his commandos had made it to
Budyonnovsk by bribing Russian police officers and that his
original plan had been to attack Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   For the Chechens, the raid on Budyonnovsk was a turning point in
the war and made Basayev a hero. For them, his tactics recalled
Imam Shamil, the legendary Caucasian warrior who fought the Czarist
armies for a quarter of a century before finally surrendering in
1859. Outgunned and outnumbered, Shamil would launch lightning
raids from his mountain hideouts on enemy outposts, causing death
and destruction and taking hostages.
</P>
<P>
   For Russians, Budyonnovsk launched Basayev's reputation as
Russia's worst terrorist. Since the war, Russian authorities have
accused Basayev of running factories that produce heroin and
hashish; they have charged that he and his hardened group of
fighters are behind kidnapping raids in southern Russia.
</P>
<P>
   With his intrusion into Dagestan, Basayev, whose ancestor fought
alongside with Shamil, is trying to borrow another of his
namesake's most successful tactics _ seeking to use Islam to unite
combattive Caucasus tribes against Russia. For the past year, he
has been advocating uniting landlocked Chechnya with Dagestan,
which borders on the Caspian Sea, into an Islamic republic governed
under the Muslim Sharia legal code.
</P>
<P>
   But for all his authority in Chechnya, Basayev's efforts as a
politician have paled next to his accomplishments as a fighter. He
placed a disappointing second to his former commander and fellow
war hero, Aslan Maskhadoc, in Chechnya's 1997 presidential
elections, and failed to deliver his promise of cracking down on
lawlessness, kidnapping and violence during a six-month tenure as
the republic's prime minister that ended last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Basayev has concentrated on building and training
his ``Islamic Peacekeeping Army,'' the multinational force he has
apparently led into Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   Basayev's failure as a politician may be as significant for the
prospects of his Dagestan expedition as his military prowess. The
job of winning the hearts and minds of people in multi-ethnic
Dagestan will not be as easy as it was with his own Chechen people.
</P>
<P>
   But the lessons of the Chechen war indicate his ability to
frustrate Russian troops should not be underestimated, even if the
Russia's current leaders themselves are doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Basayev and his sidekick Khattab _ a Jordanian of
Chechen origin who goes by one name and once served in the guard of
King Hussein _ made a new, daring promise: that they would soon
occupy Bunaisk, a city 40 miles west of Dagestan's capital.

 NEW YORK: the Amex. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It is probably a two-year project for everything we want to
get implemented,'' Sodano said. ``But we have madde some pretty
significant strides in moving the institution along in a short
period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Roughly $30 million worth of technology upgrades are already in
the works, Sodano said. These include a faster and vastly more
versatile electronic system to display and track pending stock
orders at specific prices and a new order-routing system for
equities and options that will drastically increase the capacity on
the options floor, Sodano said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond technology, the Amex plans to set up a service desk to
deal with its trading firms' problems, and it will soon hire a
senior-level sales executive to oversee efforts to attract more
listed companies and retain those already listed.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in an aggressive bid for orders from brokers who serve
individual investors, it is permitting any retail order of less
than 2,100 shares to trade on the floor at no charge. Investors are
demanding low-cost trading, Sodano said, ``and it is tough to beat
`free.'''
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, he said, 40 to 45 companies have listed on the
exchange, compared with about 50 new listings in all of 1998. ``And
we have a pipeline of more than a hundred companies waiting to
list,'' he said. ``If all goes well _ and they are all real good
companies _ we will have 150 new listings by the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   But people working with the exchange, which has wrestled with
some major scandals in its history, say management is still
struggling to bring the regulatory machinery up to speed, a problem
that must be resolved before there is any substantial surge in new
listings.
</P>
<P>
   That will further disappoint people who had expected that the
NASD would usher in a more effective pursuit of new Amex listings,
without which its trading floor cannot prosper. The continued
growth in Nasdaq's listings only adds to the apparent bitterness
that some traders have expressed.
</P>
<P>
   Among those skeptical of the efforts being made to improve the
core stock-trading operation is Andrew Schwarz, a specialist on the
Amex and a former member of its board of governors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our equity business was broken and needed to be fixed,''
Schwarz said. ``Unfortunately, that has not been fixed yet, and the
floor was, and continues to be, unhappy about that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   He favors establishing segments of the Amex market to match the
existing segments in the Nasdaq market, the National Market System
and the Small-Cap Market, with each Amex marketplace ready to list
any company that wants to move from the corresponding Nasdaq
lineup. The Amex could set up a market where even unlisted
``Bulletin Board'' stocks could benefit from auction trading, he
suggested, so long as any companies that proved dubious were
promptly kicked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go back to the basics of what Frank Zarb promised _
that companies on the Nasdaq would be given a choice between the
dealer market and the auction market _ that hasn't happened,''
Schwarz said. ``We still get hung up on miles of red tape and
listing standards.''
</P>
<P>
   He argues that the Amex can survive and prosper only if it
returns to its roots and once again becomes the auction market for
companies too small for the Big Board. Only then, he added, does it
make any sense to speculate about what a publicly traded Amex might
be worth _ and to whom.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does one predict the future when the environment is
changing as fast as it is?'' Schwarz asked as he questioned who
would dare buy shares in a stock exchange. ``If you look at the
last 50 years, there has been more change in the last two years
than in the previous 48.''
</P>
<P>
   While members are hoping for a successful turnaround that could
make the Amex more valuable, that might also intensify the
bickering over any profits from a spinoff.
</P>
<P>
   The NASD acquisition of the Amex was ``a bloodless coup,'' said
William Astrop of Atlanta, the owner of two Big Board seats and one
seat on the Amex. Estimating that an Amex seat might be worth as
much as $1 million in a public offering, Astrop predicted that
``there are going to be some unhappy seat owners when it dawns on
them that they are left out totally, that there is no payday, no
windfall.''
</P>
<P>
   Some members acquainted with the terms wondered aloud whether
the right of first refusal if the NASD sells the Amex could become
a lever for disgruntled members to pry some share of the proceeds
out of the new owner of the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Astrop, who gives Zarb extremely high marks for the progress
that has been made so far, nevertheless says that seat owners might
``get their dander up'' if the Amex was sold in a way that ``was
viewed as being high-handed.'' He mused, ``If we made a big enough
fuss, Zarb might toss us a bone just to keep us quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   Zarb said that it was ``legally debatable'' whether the old Amex
members could claim any of the proceeds from a successful Amex sale
or stock offering. ``But practically, an unfriendly transaction
would be very, very unlikely,'' Zarb insisted. ``Who would want to
own an institution that doesn't have a wholesome, happy set of
practitioners?''

HOUSTON AGREES TO NEW PLAN AIMED AT REDUCING DRUG USE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Md. and Ore.) 
 
By JERRY URBAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The city of Houston became the first municipality in
the nation Wednesday to enter into an agreement with the federal
government to develop a new comprehensive plan designed to
significantly reduce illegal drug use.
</P>
<P>
   During a downtown ceremony, the partnership agreement between
the city and the federal government was formally signed by Mayor
Lee Brown and Barry R. McCaffrey, director of the Office of
National Drug Control Policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're announcing today the first of its kind,'' said
McCaffrey, the nation's so-called drug czar. ``To understand the
(drug) problems and attempt to solve them, we've got to organize
ourselves at the community level. We intend to use this (agreement)
to produce meaningful results.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategic plan, which includes bringing together local,
state and federal law enforcement and local social service
agencies, will be developed over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will tie together information systems, No. 1,'' McCaffrey
said. ``We will develop performance targets together. We are going
to try to solve obstacles to a rational drug policy. This is the
first such effort to ... let the rest of the nation learn how a
city successfully pulled together drug-related partnerships.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those attending the ceremony was Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee,
D-Texas, who emphasized the plan will help Houston meet the
National Drug Control Strategy goal of reducing illegal drug use by
50 percent by the year 2007.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first city that will hold itself accountable on
the issues of drug treatment and prevention and interdiction,''
said Lee, who serves on the judiciary committee, which oversees
funding for the National Drug Control Policy.
</P>
<P>
   When questioned later by reporters, McCaffrey wasn't certain why
Houston was selected to develop the plan with the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   He did say: ``Houston will be a learning tool to find out how we
can assist the community in understanding the problems, collecting
data and developing standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray A. Andrews, the director of Houston Crackdown, the city's
anti-drug community coalition, believes Houston was selected
because the city has a history of coming together to fight drug
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement means a lot,'' Andrews said. ``This will help
catapult some projects we've had on the front burner.''
</P>
<P>
   Two states, Oregon and Maryland, have entered into agreements of
understanding to work with the Office of National Drug Control
Policy to develop comprehensive working plans to combat illegal
use.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said his office is talking to Texas officials and
other states to consider similar agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Texas got $254 million in federal funds to fight illegal drug
use last year, McCaffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the question is where did it go? Were performance measures
effective? And how was it being integrated? Is it producing
results?'' he asked. ``The answer is yes. But, there's room for
considerable improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey emphasized federal expenditures have significantly
increased over the past few years for drug abuse prevention. And,
he said, illegal drug use has decreased in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   However, he added, ``it's a big problem, all over the country.
Most Houston young people don't use drugs. But, unfortunately, over
50 percent of Houston high school students reported marijuana use
at least once in their life times. There were 56 deaths in Harris
County in a single month in which drugs were detected.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said the Houston plan ``will not necessarily'' involve
redirecting any federal funds that the state receives to fight drug
use. However, he's hopeful it will help city officials ``resolve
bureaucratic problems, to make sure that you have the flexibility
to apply these funds in the best way to achieve your intended
results.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who preceded McCaffrey as the nation's drug czar, added:
</P>
<P>
   ``We all share a common goal of ridding the streets of Houston
of the detrimental influences of drugs on our community,
particularly our children. This partnership agreement that we're
signing marks an important step in achieving that goal.''

RED SOX STAY AHEAD OF ROYALS, 9-3 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The best players, when they retire, often
leave something to remember them by. A uniform number, perhaps, if
they're all-timers. A worn mitt, a pair of battered spikes, a
sweat-stained cap, an autographed ball.
</P>
<P>
   When that day finally comes for 35-year-old Bret Saberhagen, who
would be the first to admit he's playing on borrowed time, there's
only one memento that would truly represent what he has meant to
the Red Sox. He might balk at being asked for it, but for all the
aggravation it has given him _ even on his best days, like
Wednesday's 9-3 win over the Kansas City Royals _ maybe he'd part
with it more readily than you'd imagine.
</P>
<P>
   After all, once he's kicking back on his yacht on Long Island,
will he really need his right shoulder anymore?
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the promotional possibilities. The Sox could prop it up
in a display case in the 600 Club, then crack it out for the
opening of the new Fenway, assuming it can be preserved until the
22d century.
</P>
<P>
   The Saberhagen Shoulder. Wind it up, and hold your breath. Built
to last . . . but we can't tell you for how long. A winner, to be
sure, but guaranteed to hurt.
</P>
<P>
   That's the reality for Saberhagen, who Wednesday pitched eight
innings for the first time in three seasons with the Sox, throwing
just 76 pitches, but admitted that the fuel gauge was on empty by
the time he was through.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sixth inning it started to get creaky, the seventh inning
a little more, and by the eighth inning I didn't have much left on
the ball,'' said Saberhagen, who was given a 6-0 lead after four
innings and limited the Royals to four hits, including bases-empty
home runs by Mike Sweeney and Tim Spehr, while walking no one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like if I went out there for the ninth inning, it
wouldn't do me any good.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen has now won nine games, against four losses, with a
shoulder he says is noticeably weaker than last year, his first
full season after coming back from reconstruction surgery. His two
stints on the disabled list, he said, have left him needing to
build up his arm strength again each time, as if he were going
through spring training all over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I can get to a plateau where I don't feel discomfort,''
he said. ``I was there early in the season, so I know it's
achievable. Achievable this year? I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) I don't have any concerns. I'll just go out there and do
what I can as long as I can. If something happens, something
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   There's something fatalistic about that vision _ and fatal to
the Sox' playoff chances, if something should happen before
October. When either Saberhagen or Pedro Martinez pitch, the Sox
are 30-8. Anybody else, and the record is 33-43.
</P>
<P>
   In games after the Sox have lost, Saberhagen's record the last
two seasons is 16-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him to come back and pitch is remarkable,'' manager Jimy
Williams said. ``For him to do what he's done, you guys pick the
words. Obviously, he's a big-game pitcher for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``And eight innings? So there's another barrier he's knocked
down, another step up.''
</P>
<P>
   With Jason Varitek resting a twisted right ankle, Lenny Webster
was crouched behind the plate for Saberhagen's spin through the
Royals' order. Saberhagen retired nine straight in one stretch, set
down the side in order four times, and only faced three batters
over the minimum. He has walked one or fewer batters in 15 of his
17 starts, none in 10 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``For any catcher,'' Webster said, ``it's always fun to be
behind there when the guy out there is throwing the ball where you
put the glove. That's what Bret was doing. I called the pitch and
wherever I set up, that's where Bret threw it.''
</P>
<P>
   Webster said that yes, he noticed Saberhagen growing weaker as
the hot afternoon advanced. Not that it placed the Sox in any
danger of losing, on a day which began with Butch Huskey's two-run
home run into the pond above the left-field waterfall in the second
and a four-run uprising in the fourth, which began with lefty Jose
Rosado walking three straight batters. Troy O'Leary singled home
one run, extending his hitting streak to 13 games, Webster's walk
forced home another, and Jose Offerman, who is batting .464 (13 for
28) against his former team, doubled home two more.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanley, who scored three times, hit his 15th home run in
the seventh, the last of 13 homers the Sox hit on this seven-game
trip, including seven in three games here. Two singles, an error,
and Huskey's infield hit in the eighth accounted for the final Sox
run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell from his warmups,'' Webster said of Saberhagen's
discomfort. ``When he starts taking a little while to get loose, it
shows. But when we notice that, we go to his other stuff, get away
from his fastball and go to his changeup and curve.''
</P>
<P>
   Webster was asked if Saberhagen's condition leaves the team with
high anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to send him out there and hurt himself,'' Webster
said. ``But he's a gamer, man. He's going to give you what he's got
on a given day. He'll go as hard as he can for as long as he can.
After there's no more left, you get somebody else to help you.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, that was lefty Rheal Cormier, who took care of the
ninth, sending the Sox home with a 5-2 record on their trip to
Anaheim and Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost the first game of each series and came back,''
Williams said. ``We regrouped and played well.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, the Sox return home for a seven-game homestand, three
games on the weekend against Seattle, then four against the Oakland
Athletics, who are challenging them for a wild-card spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the point in the season where the games seem a lot
more meaningful,'' Saberhagen said. ``We've gone through a lot of
injuries and have struggled at times, but this is something we've
got to start doing more of, playing good ball on the road. The end
of the season, we play more than half of our games on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. From Sept. 1, the Sox play 18 of their last 30 games
away from Yawkey Way. Saberhagen, creaky shoulder and all, plans to
be along for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I'm able to go out there,'' he said, ``I'm going to
keep grinding.''

NEW KINGS COACH HAS BEEN BUSY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since taking the Kings' coaching job two months ago, Andy Murray
has been to Helsinki and back, with a very purposeful side trip to
the Finnish city of Turku.
</P>
<P>
   It was last week in Turku that Murray met for more than two
hours with defenseman Aki Berg, a meeting that took place with the
blessing of Berg's agent, Larry Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Though Berg, 22, played last season in Finland because of a
contract dispute, and though he is threatening to spend another
season overseas because of an inability to resolve financial issues
with the Kings, Murray was not there to talk about money.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first question was, `Where do you want to play?' '' Murray
said this week. ``He told me he definitely wanted to play in the
NHL. If he wants to play in the NHL, the Kings are going to give
him an opportunity. My feeling is, if he spends another year in
Europe, how does that help him? I think I gave him enough reasons
why he should come back this year, and we would be very
disappointed if he didn't, but that would last about 30 seconds and
then we'd take care of the business we need to take care of, and I
let him know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray would not say at this early date what Berg's role would
be if he joined the Kings, and there is no indication of progress
in negotiations. It is believed some of Berg's past frustration
revolves around lack of time on the power play, but Murray refused
to guarantee Berg power-play time if he decides to sign with the
Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Murray divided his training-camp roster into players who
would have to play themselves off the team, and players who would
have to play themselves onto it. Murray put Berg in the first
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would guarantee he would start there (among the top six
defensemen),'' Murray said. ``There is a need for him now. But if
he doesn't come, I'll coach the team I'm given and whoever steps in
will fill the role and if he's successful in the role (Berg) would
have been given, a year from now there may not be as much of a need
for (Berg).''
</P>
<P>
   Murray hasn't been focusing all his attention on Berg. During
his European trip, Murray visited four other players - defenseman
Jere Karalahti and forwards Jozef Stumpel, Zigmund Palffy and Marko
Tuomainen. Murray also has been busy planning for training camp,
which begins Sept. 5 at Iceoplex in North Hills:
</P>
<P>
   (bullet)Of his visit with Stumpel, Murray said, ``There's a
feeling he could have been in better shape last year, and he looked
to be in pretty good shape (this summer). Coaching to me is all
about eliminating excuses. We're asking Stumpel to step up and be a
top-line center for us. We just made a major move this summer to
give him a player (Palffy) he's real comfortable with. He seems
really enthused and excited about it.''
</P>
<P>
   (bullet)Of reports that Karalahti has spent time battling a
heroin addiction, Murray said, ``I wanted to make sure he knew I
was aware of it and that we were prepared to help him in whatever
way we could. I talked to a lot of people in Finland and got great
reports that he was the best defenseman in Finland last year. He's
a quality young guy to talk to.''
</P>
<P>
   (bullet)From a strategic standpoint, Murray said he plans to
begin training camp with a No. 1 line of Stumpel, Palffy and Luc
Robitaille. Murray wouldn't divulge other planned combinations, but
acknowledged he plans to try moving Donald Audette from right wing
to left. This would seem to indicate a second line of Audette,
Bryan Smolinski and Glen Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Murray said it's not his style to frequently juggle lines,
so what you see in training camp might well be what you get when
the season begins Oct. 2 in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't change much,'' Murray said. ``When you do a lot of
changing, sometimes I think you're making excuses for the players.
When you do a lot of changes, the players think it's the line
combinations that are at fault.''
</P>
<P>
   On the personal front, Murray has rented a townhouse near the
Kings' under-construction practice facility in El Segundo. The
former prep-school coach said his wife and children will remain in
Faribault, Minn., 25 miles south of Minneapolis, during the season.
</P>
<P>
   Said Murray, ``I feel I'm going to be so consumed with the job,
probably the fit right now is to have them join me for school
trips, and I'll make the odd trip back there if we get a couple of
days off.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray sounds consumed already, and training camp is 24 days
away.

BENTSEN, FORD RECEIVE MEDAL OF FREEDOM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lloyd Bentsen, the gentlemanly Texan who wielded
power on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, and Gerald Ford, whose
term as president marked the end of Watergate nearly 25 years ago
to the day, received their nation's highest honors Wednesday as
President Clinton bestowed the Medal of Freedom to eight Americans.
</P>
<P>
   His lanky frame crouched in a wheelchair made necessary by a
stroke, Bentsen quietly blew kisses of thank you to a crowd that
included his wife, B.A.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton clasped the blue-ribboned medal, the nation's highest
honor to a civilian, around his neck and Ford grasped Bentsen's
hand as military escorts wheeled his chair back into position.
</P>
<P>
   Also honored were World Jewish Congress President Edgar M.
Bronfman Sr., labor lobbyist Evy Dubrow, charity worker Sister M.
Isolina Ferre, civil rights lawyer Oliver White Hill, human rights
advocate Max Kampelman and environmentalist Edgar Wayburn.
</P>
<P>
   The Medal of Freedom citation called Bentsen ``a man of courage,
wisdom and civility'' who had ``set the highest standard for public
service.''
</P>
<P>
   Bentsen, 78, represented Texas for 28 years in Congress,
including 22 years in the Senate where he became chairman of the
powerful Senate Finance Committee. In 1993, he became Clinton's
first Secretary of the Treasury, helping plot the administration's
plan for economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted Bentsen had been a farmhand at age 6, a bomber
pilot in World War II at 21, a congressman by 27 and a successful
businessman by 35.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then at the tender age of 71, when he had every right to
settle back and enjoy the comforts of retirement, Lloyd Bentsen
answered my call to take on perhaps the toughest challenge of his
public life, to become secretary of Treasury at a time of grave
economic difficulty for our nation,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He accepted that challenge with characteristic gusto,''
Clinton said. ``Under his leadership in 1993, when some of the rest
of us had our doubts, we passed the economic plan that paved the
way for what is now the longest peacetime expansion in our
history.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bentsen had a distinguished political career, he may best
be known to the public for his legendary putdown of a young Dan
Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   As the 1988 Democratic vice presidential nominee, Bentsen
crushed Quayle, then 41, who attempted to compare himself to
another youthful politician, John. F. Kennedy, during a debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack
Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy,''
Bentsen responded.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis lost the
presidential contest and Bentsen, often mentioned as a presidential
contender, never sought nationwide office again.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said Bentsen, who remains dapper in a gray
suit and yellow shirt, was too weary to speak to reporters. Ford,
however, told reporters about being sworn in as a congressman from
Michigan on Jan. 3, 1949 with Bentsen and being assigned an office
next door to the Texan. Across the hall was another war veteran,
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The three of us got to know each other very, very well,'' Ford
said, noting the trio would walk from their offices to the House
chambers together to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised the former Republican president for handling the
difficult days of President Nixon's resignation and the end of the
Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steady, trustworthy, Gerald Ford ended a long national
nightmare. He also ended a long and bitter war,'' Clinton said.
``When he left the White House after 895 days, America was
stronger, calmer and more self-confident. America was, in other
words, more like President Ford himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The anniversary of Nixon's resignation was this week, Ford
recalled. Ford was sworn into office in the East Room, which also
is where he received his medal. ``I couldn't avoid those
reminiscences,'' Ford said, who was accompanied by his wife and
children. ``It was a monumental day. I hope it never happens
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Clinton also bestowed the award to Jimmy and
Rosalynn Carter during a visit to Atlanta. Ford also quipped that
his wife Betty, whose battles with substance abuse prompted the
founding of the Betty Ford Center in California, had received the
Medal of Freedom nine years ago from President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad to end all discrimination,'' he said, adding he hopes
to place his medal beside his wife's at his presidential library.

PROTECTED AREAS APPROVED FOR CHANNEL ISLANDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH _ It's official. As expected, the state Fish and Game
Commission on Friday approved a policy for adopting
marine-protected areas, opening the doors for a ban on angling
along a portion of the Channel Islands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm certainly happy that it got done. It's an important first
step,'' said Jim Donlon of Camarillo, a member of the Channel
Islands Marine Resource Restoration Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The citizens' panel is joined by the Channel Islands National
Park in calling for a prohibition of commercial harvesting and
recreational angling along no less than 20 percent of the shoreline
of the six northernmost Channel Islands and out to 1 nautical mile.
The effort is in large part to better preserve diminishing stocks
of rockfish around Anacapa, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, San Miguel,
Santa Barbara and San Nicolas islands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Future generations are slighted by those who seek short-term
financial gain rather than long-term sustainable fisheries,''
Donlon said about the fishing-ban proposal. ``This fishery is
something that I want to share with future generations.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission unanimously approved the general policy regarding
``marine ecological reserves'' in Long Beach after hearing little
public dissent during one of its monthly meetings. Language
regarding the implementation of the policy will be heard by the
commission for the first time during its Aug. 27 meeting in
Bridgeport. Public comment will be heard at that time as well.
</P>
<P>
   Nine people spoke out to the commission Friday about the policy,
according to Bob Treanor, executive director of the five-member
staff. Seven were in general support, he said. One of two
dissenters complained the policy was too vague.
</P>
<P>
   The one-page policy allows the commission to establish reserves
and ban fishing in order to satisfy any or all of four purposes _
natural heritage, ecosystem biodiversity, education/research and
fisheries management.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's staff will now forward legal documents to the
Office of Administrative Law, a state agency that reviews such
regulations. The office has 30 working days to approve or reject
the policy. If approved _ which is not a certainty, Treanor said _
the policy is forwarded to the Secretary of State and normally
becomes effective within another 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns regarding the policy have come full-circle since the
commission first began hearing public comment in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning, there were concerns expressed by various
constituencies about the needs of this type of program. But when it
was all said and done, everybody worked together and what came
about was supported by basically all sides,'' said Treanor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Closing down prime fishing areas was a big concern for some
people at first. Now instead of becoming part of the problem, they
are part of the solution. Because it was an extended process, it's
gotten people to sit down to talk among themselves. And they
realize this is a global issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Criticism over how the policy will be enacted is another story,
and those with concerns have another 15 days to voice them to the
commission before the next vote is slated.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Treanor said, ``Some people don't think closures
should be as extreme.'' &QL;

or its implementation, call the state Fish and Game Commission

MAN SENTENCED IN THEFT OF MONEY FROM MISSING ATHEIST FIGURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MacCORMACK  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A former girlfriend of David R. Waters testified
in state court on Wednesday that he plotted to kill atheist figure
Madalyn Murray O'Hair more than a year before she and her two adult
children vanished in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he was going to go over there and lay in wait for
them, and kidnap and hurt them and probably kill them,'' Patti
Steffens Chavez told the District Court.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's surprise appearance electrified an otherwise routine
proceeding in which District Judge Wilford Flowers sentenced Waters
to 60 years in prison for stealing $54,400 from the O'Hair family's
atheist organization.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair, her son Jon Murray and adopted daughter Robin Murray
O'Hair are presumed dead, but their bodies have not been found
since they vanished from San Antonio nearly four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Waters, their former office manager, is accused of killing the
three in a federal affidavit. However, he has not been charged and
has denied any knowledge of their disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Chavez, Waters' plan to kidnap the O'Hairs
began in April 1994 while they were in San Diego defending
themselves in a civil lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Waters had acquired guns, ropes, handcuffs and other implements
of abduction and had laid off all the atheist organization's
employees in preparation for the crime, she testified.
</P>
<P>
   But, Chavez said, he had a change of heart when she called him
at the American Atheist General Headquarters on the day the O'Hairs
were to return to Austin and begged him to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Please get out of there.' I guess he was kind of
freaked out himself. They hadn't returned, and he hadn't heard from
them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was angry with me for not having any moxie,'' Chavez
testified.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she said, Waters stole $54,400 from the organization.
</P>
<P>
   He pleaded guilty in 1995 to stealing $54,400 and was given 10
years to repay the money and was ordered to stay out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But this spring Waters pleaded guilty to two federal firearms
charges after FBI agents found ammunition in his apartment during a
March 24 search. State prosecutors then asked that Waters' 1995
guilty plea be adjudicated and that he be sentenced.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's appearance was not. Her vivid testimony is the first
account in open court about a critical three-year period from when
Waters went to work for O'Hair through late 1995.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair gained prominence more than 30 years ago for her court
fights against school prayer.
</P>
<P>
   At times fighting back tears, Chavez also told about violent
incidents during her seven-year relationship with Waters, some
involving deadly weapons.
</P>
<P>
   According to Chavez, Waters' anger toward O'Hair was stoked in
the summer of 1995 when the atheist leader published a lengthy
account in a newsletter of Waters' theft. The account also closely
examined Waters' criminal past that included murder, battery and
forgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Madalyn O'Hair had written a rather extreme news article
about him from his youthful misadventures up the to the present, he
expressed an interest in hurting her,'' she testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things about torture, like pulling off her toes with pliers.
Things that at the time seemed humorous in a macabre sort of way,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez said she left Waters, who is now 52, a year ago and has
since married.
</P>
<P>
   She said they decided to contact the FBI this spring after
learning of the gruesome fate of Danny Fry, an alleged accomplice
of Waters whose headless body was dumped near Dallas in October
1995. His corpse was not identified until January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be a benefit to be no longer involved in a
situation where a man was decapitated and his hands were cut off,''
Chavez said.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez left Texas early this year and is living in an
undisclosed state.
</P>
<P>
   Waters' lawyer, Patrick Ganne, told the judge the hearing was
not about the disappearance of O'Hair. ``You have to sentence a man
to stealing ... that is the only issue before you.''
</P>
<P>
   Waters is scheduled to be sentence on Aug. 20 in federal court
in Austin for his guilty pleas on possession of firearms and
ammunition.

A KINDER, GENTLER ASIAN PRISON MOVIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Brokedown Palace,'' like the recent ``Return to Paradise'' and
``Red Corner'' before it, belongs to a movie subgenre that could be
called ``Asia Is a Bad Place to Be in Prison, Especially If You're
an American.'' The title refers to a Thai prison, where Alice
(Claire Danes) and Darlene (Kate Beckinsale) land after being
convicted on drug-smuggling charges.
</P>
<P>
   This might not be that bad a place to be in prison. The two
women are apparently allowed to keep applying makeup, at least
until they're thrown into solitary (or not-exactly-solitary, since
they're tossed there together). Their manicures remain largely
intact, even after they've been digging in the dirt by hand. Even
Alice admits at one point: ``I wasn't too scared at first. I mean,
I've had worse haircuts.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the foundations of Asia-is-a-Bad-Place-to-Be-in-Prison
movies, which have little concern for political correctness or
diplomatic relations, is that over there, you're guilty until
proved innocent. ``Breakdown Palace'' manages some marginal mystery
over whether the women are actually guilty. Lifelong friends Alice,
the (relatively) tough one, and Darlene, the (relatively) rich,
spoiled one, begin heading into this mess when they decide to
celebrate their high school graduation with a trip to Thailand
instead of Hawaii. Why they make this decision is mystifying, since
once they get to Thailand they begin to act like privileged, naive
Americans (which makes it hard to sympathize with them once they're
arrested). Then they hook up with an Australian stud who turns out
to be a drug runner who may or may not have framed them on the
smuggling charge.
</P>
<P>
   Once Alice and Darlene are busted at an airport as they await a
plane to Hong Kong, they begin their descent into hell. Except that
since the movie is so stubbornly PG-13, diminishing its realism and
giving everything an Afterschool Special feel, it's more like a
descent into heck. Aside from that brief stay in not-so-solitary
and a few hard raps on the knuckles, the worst thing the women
endure is having another inmate stick her tongue out at them. With
Danes' most famous role still in mind, the movie becomes ``My
So-Called Life Sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the cast of ``Brokedown Palace'' are Bill Pullman
(slumming, but not as hard as in ``Lake Placid'') as a
Thailand-based crusading American lawyer who comes to the women's
aid; sitcom actor Tom Amandes as Darlene's smug father, who
disappears from the movie once it's apparent that he can't help the
women; and Lou Diamond Phillips, keeping his excessive tendencies
in check as a Thai-American bureaucrat. Unfortunately, Phillips is
most entertaining when he is being excessive; kept under control,
he's wasted talent.
</P>
<P>
   The movie will appeal most to teen-agers and young people, which
must be why Jonathan Kaplan films it like a VH1 video; this must be
the most stylishly lighted prison in film history. Kaplan does
manage to pull a good performance out of Danes, who has yet to
fulfill the promise she showed in ``My So-Called Life,'' and he
ekes out some messages about friendship and sacrifice. But as a
social commentator, Kaplan has taken a big step down since 1987's
``The Accused,'' a movie that had some people accusing him of being
too brutal. He tips the scales so far in the other direction here
that he might as well have made ``Brokedown Palace'' for
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brokedown Palace'' is rated PG-13 for frank dialogue,
profanity, drug use and violence.

SURF'S DOWN FOR SPORT'S POPULARITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEREMY   BAGOTT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENTURA _ Windsurfing has been plunging in popularity since its
heyday in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The sport's problems are many. Boards and sails are expensive,
if you can even find stores that carry the equipment. Newcomers
find it nearly impossible to locate organized instruction. And the
sport has a learning curve like an angle iron.
</P>
<P>
   So why would anyone take up windsurfing?
</P>
<P>
   Rick Hambleton thinks he knows the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need a crew and you don't have to make sandwiches
the night before,'' said Hambleton, a former Ventura Port District
commissioner and high school sailing coach and now an adviser to
the U.S. Naval Academy's sailing program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can rig up the board in 20 minutes and sail for an hour or
two, plus it's exhilarating and faster than any other kind of
sailing.''
</P>
<P>
   Windsurfing, known generically as sailboarding, was the
brainchild of Newman Darby, who recently lectured at the
Smithsonian for the sport's 30th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   The recreation's golden era was in the mid-'80s, during
windsurfing's technological dark ages _ before the revolution in
lightweight Kevlar boards and high-tech sails that make the sport
easier and faster today. Twenty-pound sails and 30-pound boards in
the 1970s and early 1980s gave way to 9-pound sails and 13-pound
boards in this decade.
</P>
<P>
   While fewer are taking up the sport, an avid windsurfer nearly
made it to the White House in the person of Democratic Sen. John
Kerry of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The sport requires above-average physical conditioning in the
stomach, back, legs and arms. And anything the aspiring windsurfer
has learned about sailing boats does not automatically apply to
sailing boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing too much about conventional sailing can be a
hindrance,'' Hambleton said. ``It's often easier to teach someone
to windsurf if they don't come into it with a lot of baggage.''
</P>
<P>
   Windsurfing's meccas are the Columbia River Gorge between Oregon
and Washington and the north shore of Maui in Hawaii. Closer
afield, Leo Carrillo State Beach and Castaic Lake are popular, as
is the mouth of the San Gabriel River at Seal Beach.
</P>
<P>
   But windsurfers bond no matter where they gather.
</P>
<P>
   When Ventura's Full Sail Windsurfing Club convenes, the talk
goes to the finer points of the recreation. Terms such as
``mast-foot pressure,'' ``shredding,'' ``low-end power'' and
``planing'' float in and out of conversation. The 100 or so
members, most in their 30s and 40s, bring an array of experience
and gear into the mix. State-of-the-art boards and sails from
makers such as North Sails, Seatrend and Mistral dominate.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Veseth, 42, a Ventura insurance broker, is a longtime club
member who sails in the shorebreak off Surfer's Point in his home
town. He is out there so often, it's rumored his heart pounds in
four- and five-beat sets. He had just been back from the Columbia
River Gorge for a couple of hours when I caught up with him.
</P>
<P>
   Veseth, who got hooked on sailboarding 15 years ago, was flying
over 4-foot breakers on a sailboard made of a feather-light
composite material. Oh, did I mention you can pay $1,200 to $1,500
for the board alone?
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike the old days, these rigs require very little wind to
get going,'' he said. ``I'm one of the old guys out here, but I
remember how it was.''
</P>

It's tough because it's difficult to master,'' Hambleton said.

   Recently at CSUN's Aquatic Center on the shores of Castaic Lake
_ one of the few places in the Los Angeles area where a kid in
summer camp can learn to windsurf _ 19-year-old instructor Morgan
``Sausage'' Frohman of Los Angeles worked with Ian McDonald, 13, of
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Frohman reviewed the parts of one of the center's extremely wide
and buoyant beginner's rigs. Later, as her pupil was on a broad
reach, heading away from shore, she shouted to him to tilt the sail
forward to turn the board and take baby steps around the mast as
the board comes about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned to windsurf (at Castaic) as a camper myself,''
Frohman said. ``For a kid, the lack of strength is the biggest
handicap; it takes a lot of power to pull the sail up.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, there's the issue of sailing theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell them as many times as you want to stay on the
windward side of the board and it won't do any good,'' she said.
``Sometimes they just have to figure it out on their own.'' &QL;

A NATION UNDER FIRE SEEKS ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   Shootings in high schools in Colorado and Georgia. Shootings at
a Las Vegas grocery store and at two Atlanta brokerage firms.
Shootings at a Mormon library in Salt Like City and, on Tuesday, at
a Jewish community center in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The bitter harvest of this millennium-ending year is raising
fears, tensions _ and difficult questions.
</P>
<P>
   All around the country one can feel the temperature going up,
and not because of the weather. The problem this time is the
national climate.
</P>
<P>
   Once again parents are trying to explain the inexplicable to
their children, political leaders seem helpless to respond to a
crisis that requires resolve but is immune to congressional
resolutions, and social commentators are asking whether media
coverage of violent outbursts fosters public understanding or
fosters copycat crime.
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1968, when the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Senator
Robert F. Kennedy were assassinated and when fires burned in
American cities, has a spate of violent incidents prompted such
deep, disquieting introspection.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, this is a country confused and confounded. The
experts' statistics show violent crime is in decline. The public's
impression is that violence is an ever more pervasive influence in
American life.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics say America is safer than ever. The public feels
it is more vulnerable than ever.
</P>
<P>
   And so to the list of great divides in the nation _ the gap
between the public and the politicians, the gap between rich and
poor, the gap between the races, the gap between the
technologically fluent and the technologically flustered _ is added
a new one:
</P>
<P>
   The division between what America's head says and what its heart
fears.
</P>
<P>
   That division is one of the most significant in our national
life, governing not the way we legislate nor the way earn our
living nor the way we save for the future. It governs something far
more intimate. It governs the way we live.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics make a powerful counter-argument. According to the
Justice Department, violent crime rates have declined since 1994,
homicide rates recently declined to levels last seen before 1969,
assault rates have declined since 1994, and the number of crimes
committed with firearms has been declining since 1993. Just this
week, an Education Department study found a dramatic decline in the
number of students expelled from school for carrying firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of reasons to think the world might come to an
end in the next couple of years,'' said Roger Lane, a Haverford
College historian who studies violence in American life. ``But
increasing rates of violence is not one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the world seems more forbidding, more frightening, than
ever. This week the airwaves were full of footage of young children
being led from a crime scene, of police helicopters hovering
ominously over a day camp, of SWAT teams taking up rifle positions
in a playground, of ambulances rushing from a bloody public
building.
</P>
<P>
   These scenes were unavoidable, broadcast on 24-hour cable
outlets, on network news shows, recycled for the local news
programs and appearing in daily newspapers and on Internet Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in media treatment of violence today is that raw
footage is often telecast live to an audience that has no idea how
the conflict will be resolved. ``It makes you feel identified with
an unfolding tragedy,'' said Jane Hall, an assistant professor of
communications at American University.
</P>
<P>
   All media outlets are drawn to crime, especially local
newscasts. James T. Hamilton, director of the Duke University
Program on Violence in the Media, studied 60 television stations in
20 American markets and found that a third of the stories on local
news were about crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The debate is whether they are reflecting reality or whether
they are selling a product, namely violent entertainment,''
Hamilton said. ``I think it is the latter. The effect of that is to
create the idea that this is a `mean world.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The result is a return to the sort of soul-searching that the
country undertook in 1968, when the two assassinations and the
urban upheaval prompted worried Americans to question the nation's
culture and its strain of violence. But the country has changed
significantly since that last bout of introspection.
</P>
<P>
   That time it occurred in the middle of an unpopular war and at
the crescendo of a youth rebellion that called into question all
the political, social, and cultural assumptions of American life.
This time the violence occurs in an era of relative peace,
staggering prosperity, and general contentment.
</P>
<P>
   That time the violence seemed part of a great social upheaval,
and the memorable episodes _ the sight of King dying on the Memphis
balcony, the glimpse of Kennedy lying in a pool of his own blood in
a Los Angeles hotel kitchen _ seemed to be markers in history. This
time the violence seems even more random, even more senseless.
</P>
<P>
   That time the violence seemed to put the nation's stability at
risk. This time the violence seems to put our sense of personal
safety at risk.
</P>
<P>
   That time the television broadcasts and newspaper reports seemed
catastrophic. This time it seems commonplace. ``Oh, another
senseless shooting in America,'' said Claire Bolderson, an
anchorwoman for the BBC's ``World Today'' show. ``We say that just
about every week.''
</P>
<P>
   But the great tragedy of Columbine High and Heritage High and
the Mormon Family History Library and the North Valley Jewish
Community Center _ the great tragedy of our age _ is just that. The
catastrophic has become commonplace.

SERBIAN BISHOPS CALL ON MILOSEVIC AND SERB PRESIDENT TO RESIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The bishops of the Serbian Orthodox
Church issued an appeal Wednesday to Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to resign, along with Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic, and make room for others who could save the country
from destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The statement was released as the conclusion of a Bishops'
Conference that took place in Belgrade on Tuesday. It is not the
first time church leaders have called for the resignation of
Milosevic, but the strong language of the statement, and the
endorsement by the bishops gathered from all over the country, has
put the church in unequivocal opposition to the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appeal to the presidents of Serbia and Yugoslavia _ if they
genuinely do not want to make hostages of their people and their
state and lead them to destruction _ to let others lead the people
and the country out of this dead end,'' the statement read.
</P>
<P>
   The church was pushed to make its appeal because of the ``tragic
state into which our people have been brought, primarily in Kosovo
but also in the entire country, especially by the recent war and
NATO bombing,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   It went on to call for a transitional government and early
elections, among other changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We support all democratic and patriotic forces in the country
and request that urgent changes in the country begin with an
interim government and preparations for preliminary elections,''
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The bishops decided, though, that the head of the church,
Patriarch Pavle, should not attend the opposition rally planned for
Aug. 19 in Belgrade. Opposition politicians had pressed the church
to show its support by attending the multiparty rally.
</P>
<P>
   The decision not to attend may be an attempt to accommodate the
positions of some bishops who support the government, but it is
more likely that it reflects a concern within the church to
maintain a certain distance from politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The patriarch will not turn up, because we believe a rally is
not the place for the expression of the position of the head of our
church, and this appeal is a sufficient message for those who want
to listen,'' Bishop Artemije, head of the church in Kosovo, told
reporters in the town of Nis after the conference.
</P>
<P>
   The church said in its statement that its role was instead to
speak out. It emphasized the need for peaceful, democratic change,
without violence, and asked for citizens to be responsible.
</P>
<P>
   It blamed the Yugoslav government for all the ``evil'' that has
happened in the southern province of Kosovo, and but also accused
NATO forces of failing to stop the killing of Serbs and the
destruction of churches and Orthodox holy sites here.
</P>
<P>
   It appealed for NATO and the U.N. structures in Kosovo to stop
the terrorizing of ethnic Serbs and other minorities, ``which is
occurring in their presence and under their auspices.''
</P>
<P>
   The church's statement provides strong backing for the
opposition movement as the Aug. 19 rally approaches. The rally will
be a test of the urgency of the public mood for political change
after a month of protests across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The former Yugoslav army chief of staff, Gen. Momcilo Perisic,
who has added his weight to the opposition recently, called on
members of the armed forces to join his new political party, the
Movement for Democratic Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seriousness of our situation demands every patriot,
especially every soldier, to do whatever possible to prevent
negative trends in the country from continuing,'' Perisic told
Reuters in an interview Tuesday. He warned that trying to use the
army against the people would backfire.

SOUTHWEST AIRLINES' CEO HAS PROSTATE CANCER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mich., Texas)   By REED ABELSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I've got a little dab of prostate cancer which will soon be
irradiated out of existence.''
</P>
<P>
   In characteristic fashion, the chairman and chief executive of
the Southwest Airlines Co., Herb Kelleher, told employees Wednesday
that he was starting eight weeks of radiation treatment for
prostate cancer in Houston. His condition, he wrote in a memorandum
to them, was not serious, and he apologized for troubling them with
this ``tidbit.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also played down the news. In a news release,
Southwest emphasized that Kelleher, 68, planned to be in the office
throughout his treatment _ and even included a quip that Kelleher
thought his colleagues would be disappointed to find him in the
office so much, given his usual heavy travel schedule. Kelleher
also held a brief news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock barely budged, falling 12.5 cents Wednesday,
to $16.375.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a few years ago, when companies were reluctant to talk
about the health of their top executives, Southwest was quick to go
public with the news about Kelleher. The subject has lost much of
its stigma since Andy Grove, the chief executive of the Intel
Corp., talked about his experience with prostate cancer in a
Fortune magazine cover story in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unlike erectile dysfunction,'' said Gerald C. Meyers,
the former chairman of American Motors and a business professor
emeritus at the University of Michigan. Who ``would talk about that
six months ago?''
</P>
<P>
   But while companies are much more open about what might be
ailing their top executives, and are obliged to disclose anything
serious, there is another sensitive issue that fewer are willing to
discuss: the company's succession plan should something happen to
the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest, which had come under criticism for not being more
open about who might succeed Kelleher well before Wednesday's
announcement, is particularly close-mouthed. A recent shareholder
resolution, for example, called for Kelleher to divide his duties,
given his penchant for smoking and flying, so that the company
would no be longer be subject to ``one-man rule,'' and Business
Week ran a scathing commentary earlier this month about his lack of
a successor.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kelleher's prognosis is very good, according to his
doctor's statement, the news clearly fuels concern over whether
anyone at Southwest could take Kelleher's place. Kelleher and his
larger-than-life personality is closely identified with the success
of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher co-founded the airline in 1971 and has held the titles
of chairman, chief executive and president since 1981. Southwest,
the nation's fourth-largest carrier, has been praised for its
winning combination of low costs and high customer service, and
Kelleher has managed to engender huge loyalty among the company's
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really represents a lot of the spirit of Southwest,'' said
Steven J. Colbert, a senior analyst for Jurika &AMP; Voyles, an
investment management firm in Oakland, Calif., that is a Southwest
shareholder. While Colbert said the company had many good managers,
he said that he would like to have a better sense of who might be
in line to take over if something were to happen to Kelleher.
</P>
<P>
   The company has a succession plan that has been reviewed by its
board, a spokeswoman said, but the details of that plan have not
been made public because identifying future leaders might be
divisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not acceptable if there is no succession plan,'' Meyers
said. ``It is understandable and desirable if the company does not
lay out all its succession plans in a premature way.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say that Southwest has sufficient management
talent to replace Kelleher, even if it is unclear which of the
senior executives might be among those in the race. ``They know
what the formula is and wouldn't have to tinker with it,'' said
Raymond F. Neidl, an analyst for ING Barings.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging Kelleher's outsized reputation as ``a kind of a
superman,'' Meyers agreed. ``What is making that business go is not
the leader, it's the business model.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But despite the light tone employed in Wednesday's disclosure,
there is little doubt that investors are taking the issue of
succession seriously. While Kelleher has indicated that he expects
to keep running the company through the end of next year, when his
current contract expires, if not much longer, every company needs
to prepare for the chief executive's sudden departure as well as
eventual retirement, according to Charles M. Elson, a professor at
Stetson University College of Law and an expert in corporate
governance.
</P>
<P>
   Even Grove, who was never forced to step down at Intel as chief
executive because of his illness, had very clear succession plans,
he noted. &QL;

U.N. HAS PLAN FOR CAMBODIA WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United Nations has developed detailed plans for
a joint war crimes tribunal in Cambodia in which Cambodian and
foreign judges would try former political and military leaders of
the Khmer Rouge in a single trial, U.N. and Clinton administration
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. lawyers came up with the plan after the Cambodian
government rejected an earlier proposal to try Pol Pot's former
associates in a fully independent international tribunal like those
created to deal with war crimes in the Balkans and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   According to internal U.N. documents proposing the joint
tribunal, Secretary-General Kofi Annan would select an independent
prosecutor and the international judges, while the Cambodian
government would select the Cambodian judges.
</P>
<P>
   Under the U.N. plan, the court would have either five judges,
two of them Cambodian, or seven judges, three of them Cambodian _ a
composition insuring that the Cambodian judges could always be
outvoted by their foreign counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Hun Sen is likely to resist some elements of the
U.N. plan, especially the requirement that foreign judges outnumber
Cambodian judges. His foreign minister, Hor Nam Hong, said
Wednesday in parliament that the government would reject such a
provision.
</P>
<P>
   The documents, prepared by Ralph Zacklin, assistant
secretary-general for legal affairs, call for a single joint trial
of all the Khmer Rouge leaders who remain in Cambodia, a
prosecutorial strategy that is ``the one likely to have the most
profound moral and educational effect on the Cambodian society.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan for a joint tribunal is expected to be presented to Hun
Sen when U.N. lawyers visit there, possibly late this week.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen, a former low-level Khmer Rouge soldier who defected
from the organization in 1977, has suggested in recent months that
he would accept the idea of Cambodian and foreign judges' sharing
responsibility for the trial.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials said Wednesday that they were not worried by his
objections, suggesting they were an effort to stake out Hun Sen's
early _ but not final _ position in negotiations with the U.N.
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   If Hun Sen does accept the plan in some form, U.N. officials
said, some of the 20th century's worst mass murderers could be
brought to justice in a Cambodian courtroom as early as next year,
with foreign prosecutors and judges having at least a large degree
of control over the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   More than a million Cambodians died _ from execution, torture,
disease or hunger _ under the Khmer Rouge government that
controlled Cambodia from 1975 to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials say they have been presented
with the outline of the plan and are weighing whether the United
States would support the joint tribunal by providing money and
staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first glance, this has some promise,'' an administration
official said. ``But we'd want lots of safeguards built into this
process to prevent Hun Sen from trying to turn this into show
trials or some other sort of sham.''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups also expressed caution. ``A so-called mixed
tribunal in Cambodia is an idea worth pursuing, but only with
adequate guarantees built in,'' said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington
director of Human Rights Watch Asia. ``A tribunal that would in any
way be controlled by the Cambodian government would not have
legitimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. documents say that the court would be established under
Cambodian law, not international law. The documents were made
available on condition that their source not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a Nuremberg-type trial in which the Khmer Rouge
political and military leadership is tried jointly,'' according to
a memo prepared last month by the U.N. legal office. ``A joint
trial would be legally sound, politically effective,
administratively and financially cost-effective and of high moral
and educative value.''
</P>
<P>
   Zacklin's memo said that the United Nations should demand that
the Cambodian government provide ``viable guarantees'' that ``all
Khmer Rouge leaders presently on Cambodian territory are arrested
by the Cambodian government and surrendered to the tribunal.''
</P>
<P>
   Pot Pot, the leader of the Khmer Rouge, died last year, an event
that effectively signaled the collapse of the Khmer Rogue as a
guerrilla threat.
</P>
<P>
   But many of his senior deputies and military commanders are
still alive, including Ta Mok, a one-legged general known as the
Butcher, who was captured earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Cambodian prosecutors had faced a Sept. 9 deadline for the start
of his trial, but the Cambodian parliament voted Wednesday to allow
a delay of up three years in the trials of former Khmer Rouge
leaders and others charged with genocide or crimes against
humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups have warned that unless there is quick
action to create a tribunal, Cambodia could lose its chance to
bring Khmer Rouge leaders to justice, especially given the advanced
age and poor health of many suspects.
</P>
<P>
   A group of legal experts working for the United Nations
recommended earlier this year that senior Khmer Rouge leaders be
tried at an independent international tribunal, outside the control
of the Cambodian government. But Hun Sen quickly rejected the
proposal as a violation of Cambodia's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. and Clinton administration officials who have dealt with
Hun Sen say he fears that a fully independent tribunal might turn
its attention to his own past actions and those of other Khmer
Rouge defectors who are now in the Cambodian government.
</P>
<P>
   There has never been any serious accusation that Hun Sen was
involved in atrocities during the Khmer Rogue era, and U.N. envoys
and foreign diplomats have tried to convince the Cambodian leader
that he would never be a target for prosecution.

TEXAS ATTORNEY GENERAL GETS GREEN LIGHT, $1.5 MILLION FOR WAR ON
GAMBLING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Attorney General John Cornyn said Wednesday that
Gov. George W. Bush's office has given him a $1.5 million grant to
wage a three-year war on illegal gambling in Texas, whether it be
in Indian casinos, highway truck stops or on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This generous grant will help us fund our on-going commitment
to enforce Texas law during the next three years,'' Cornyn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say personally how much I appreciate the governor's
continued commitment to law enforcement in Texas,'' Cornyn added.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's grant will supplement an earlier $120,000 grant
to target illegal gaming. Cornyn said he'll use the money, which is
from Bush's discretionary criminal justice fund, to form a
seven-member task force to prosecute illegal gaming.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to pursuing operators of ``eight-liner'' slot
machines and illegal Internet games, Cornyn said his team will
press its investigation of the Speaking Rock Casino in El Paso,
which is run by the Tigua Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas prohibits illegal gambling, and I have sworn to uphold
those laws, and I intend to do just that. Those who ignore the law
or attempt to find loopholes around the law are today placed on
notice that my office will vigorously and aggressively enforce the
anti-gambling laws and prosecute all violators,'' Cornyn said.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn said he asked Bush for the financial assistance, and the
governor obliged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor has been long concerned about illegal gambling,''
including the controversial Tigua casino that the federally
recognized tribe maintains is entirely legal.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn said his stance is based on a ruling by the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans that prohibits the tribe
from conducting any games, including slot machines, not authorized
by Texas law.
</P>
<P>
   Since May 1998, Cornyn said, his agency has prosecuted 16 cases
involving eight-liner machines, and eight resulted in convictions.
Since January, when Cornyn took office, agents have confiscated
``hundreds'' of eight-liner machines and tens of thousands of
dollars in wagers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn said cracking down on Internet gaming, which is often
provided by offshore companies, is a vexing challenge. But his team
may be able to affect the situation by preventing the gaming
companies from collecting gambling debts in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any one of us can get on a Web site and gamble on a card game
or slot machine with high stakes, just as if you were in Las Vegas
_ even though it's illegal in Texas,'' Cornyn said.
</P>
<P>
   Hinting at his strategy for dealing with the proliferation of
on-line games, Cornyn said states, including Missouri, Minnesota
and New York, ``have been successful in obtaining injunctions
against the operation of Internet gambling sites operating within
their states. Our work will be modeled after what they've done.''

INTEREST-RATE OPTIMISM SPURS STOCKS HIGHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After early hesitation, stocks bounded higher
Wednesday as computer-related shares lifted the Nasdaq market by
just over 3 percent, its biggest gain in eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Besides bargain-hunting and a handful of surprisingly strong
earnings reports, notably that of Cisco Systems, the main catalyst
seemed to be a growing belief that interest rates might be
approaching a peak. That notion seemed to spread in the afternoon
when a Federal Reserve survey found ``no evidence of any
broad-based pickup'' in consumer prices or in wages.
</P>
<P>
   Rate jitters have bedeviled stock markets in recent weeks, with
most analysts expecting the Federal Reserve to raise short-term
rates by another quarter-point at its Aug. 24 meeting. But after
that, said Ned Riley Jr., chief investment officer at BankBoston,
this pressure on stocks may subside. ``Equity investors seem a bit
more optimistic that rates will retreat after the Federal Open
Market Committee'' meeting, he said, noting that high-technology
and financial stocks, which are among the most highly sensitive to
rates, were pace-setters in Wednesday's rally.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Kugel, senior strategist at Stein Roe &AMP; Farnham, largely
agreed. ``If we have any more increases, it won't be a lot,'' he
said. ``The beige book put the icing on it,'' he added, referring
to the Fed's eight-times-a-year survey that it uses to help it make
monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   Another favorable development Wednesday was the fact that more
than three stocks advanced for every two that declined on the New
York Stock Exchange, the best result since mid-July. Volume was a
moderate 782.8 million, compared with 831.6 million Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index ended with a gain of 20.50
points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,301.93, while the Dow Jones industrial
average rose 132.65 points, or 1.24 percent, to 10,787.80. The
Nasdaq rose 74.87, or 3 percent, to 2,564.98.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty of the 30 stocks in the Dow advanced, but J.P. Morgan, up
4 3/4 to 126 11/16, and IBM, up 4 to 123 5/16, accounted for
one-third of the rise. Alcoa also posted a big gain, 2 15/16 to 69
3/8, after making a $5.6 billion bid for Reynolds Metals, which
soared 9 3/8 to 65 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Drug stocks, weighed down amid continuing fears of federal
legislation that would curb prices, were behind in the rally. Merck
was the biggest loser among Dow stocks, down 1 5/16 to 60 15/16.
Eli Lilly slumped 1 13/16 to 61 1/2 while American Home Products,
mired in litigation, fell 2 3/8 to 41.
</P>
<P>
   Although the climate for initial public offerings has recently
soured, Red Hat Inc., which sells a version of a computer operating
system that competes with Microsoft Windows, made a spectacular
debut. The company, based in Durham, N.C., offered 6 million shares
at 14 and they finished at 51 1/16 on a volume of 17.9 million
shares, meaning that each share changed hands an average of three
times. This was the biggest gain for an initial offering since July
1.
</P>
<P>
   But Blockbuster Inc.'s 31 million shares, spun off by Viacom,
ended the first day of trading at the offering price of 15,
apparently requiring support from the underwriters, Salomon Smith
Barney.
</P>
<P>
   The session's high-technology winners, most of them computer
companies as opposed to Internet plays, included surges of 4 1/4 to
76 for Intel, 4 3/16 from Tuesday's official close for Cisco to 61
15/16, 5 1/4 to 58 7/8 for EMC, 5 1/4 for Gateway to 83 1/4, 4 1/4
for Motorola to 92 3/4 and 1 1/4 for Microsoft to 84 3/16. America
Online jumped 7 3/8 to 92 3/8.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deflated Internet sector is very healthy for the market,''
said Timothy Morris, a senior official at Bessemer Trust.
</P>
<P>
   Among financial stocks, besides J. P. Morgan, Merrill Lynch rose
3 5/16 to 67, Goldman Sachs 4 1/2 to 61 1/2, Chase Manhattan 2 5/8
to 76 15/16, and American Express 2 1/2 to 127.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues beat declining ones on the Big Board by 1,881
to 1,147, the biggest net rise since July 15, according to Morgan
Stanley. New 52-week lows, however, exceeded new highs by 230 to
44.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, stocks were modestly higher in Europe, about unchanged
in Japan and up 3 percent in Brazil and 2.4 percent in Mexico.

SELF-RESCUE IS KEY TO SAFE WINDSURFING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEREMY BAGOTT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENTURA _ Beginning windsurfers should become familiar with the
self-rescue. Experts note it can be a life-saver.
</P>
<P>
   It's not uncommon for neophytes to sail downwind only to
discover they can't turn around.
</P>
<P>
   The self-rescue is like pulling up stakes when there is no other
solution. It involves furling the sail, disconnecting the mast,
laying the components lengthwise with the sailboard and paddling
in.
</P>
<P>
   Under the most hazardous conditions _ when weather, seas or
hypothermia become a real factor _ the sail and boom can even be
tossed overboard to lighten the load. It might be an expensive
proposition, but it's better than the alternative. Therefore,
understand how to disassemble the rig before ever setting out.
</P>
<P>
   Under no circumstances should you leave the sailboard and
attempt to swim in.
</P>
<P>
   To get started, begin with simple ``board only'' exercises in
protected water _ a shallow lagoon, swimming pool or quiet corner
of a harbor. The following should be mastered before the sail is
ever connected to the sailboard:
</P>
<P>
   _ Lying on the board and paddling it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Standing up.
</P>
<P>
   _ Walking out to each side of the board and being able to gently
wobble it without losing balance.
</P>
<P>
   _ Walking the length of the board with confidence.
</P>
<P>
   After the on-water work, come ashore and stow the sailboard.
Plan to practice the next phase on land.
</P>
<P>
   _ Grab the sail by the uphaul line. With the wind at your back,
stand the sail up. If it's windy, brace the base of the mast with a
foot or a large rock.
</P>
<P>
   _ Let the breeze grab the sail as you hold the boom at the
gooseneck. The sail should flap with the wind like a flag; this is
called luffing. The sail and mast are now in the safety position.
Become proficient with this position, since it is the starting-off
point and _ other than just falling in _ it's how you stop.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tilt the mast forward and backward. This technique will be
used later to turn the board. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Windsurfing has become a lot like golf, with people employing
different boards and sails for different conditions,'' said John
Van Arsdale, head of the CSUN Aquatics Center at Castaic Lake.
``For beginners, the idea is to have a large, wide board and as
small a sail as you can find.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, a word of advice about attaching a rope between the dock
and the windsurfing rig: A tether may sound like a logical way to
get back to shore in a pinch, but a skipper of a boat might not see
it and cut between you and the dock, fouling his propeller and
causing damage to you, your rig, the dock or all three. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arrangements for windsurfing instruction can be made through the
CSUN Aquatics Center, (805) 257-0571, and UCLA Marine Aquatics,
(310) 823-0048. For moral support and camaraderie, contact the Full
Sail Windsurfing Club in Ventura at (805) 642-4422 or see its
www.venturalink.net/(TILDE)gibbsrus Web site.

LOW EXERCISE RATE STIRS CONCERN ABOUT BLACKS' HEALTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ At 4:30 p.m., the health-conscious set
begins filling Fazekes Gym in a slow and steady trickle.
</P>
<P>
   By 5 p.m., there are 20, maybe 30 people hoping to work off the
day's stress and burn off yesterday's calories. Some are running
toward their goal on treadmills, while others strain to raise a
50-pound weight above their heads. You know the drill. It's the
same at fitness clubs, community centers and YMCAs nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   But a disturbing pattern is clearly visible among those working
out, and that is an absence of African-Americans. Coupled with
unhealthful eating habits, this may help explain why the general
health and life expectancy of blacks lag those of their white
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go to any health club, convention or community center
like the YMCA, you're not going to see a big percentage of
African-Americans working out,'' says Donna Richardson, a regular
fitness contributor on NBC's ``Today'' and ``Weekend Today.''
Richardson has produced nine workout videos and written a new
b7ook, ``Let's Get Real: Exercise Your Right to a Healthy Body''
(Pocket Books, $16). ``If you see any at all, there will be more
men than women.''
</P>
<P>
   This is disturbing, given health statistics, especially as they
apply to black women. According to the American Heart Association,
the heart-disease death rate for black women is 222.6 per 100,000,
which is 69 percent higher than that for white females. For stroke,
the death rate is 39.9 per 100,000 black women, which is 75.8
percent higher than the rate for white women.
</P>
<P>
   Black women smoke more, have higher blood cholesterol and are
often more obese; thus, they suffer more from high blood pressure
and diabetes. They are also more likely to live in neighborhoods
where most families are headed by women. Consequently, their health
is more likely to be compromised by family obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Among those distressed is Bryan Foster, owner of Fazekes Gym,
one of a growing number of fitness clubs in Tarrant County owned
and operated by African-American men.
</P>
<P>
   Among more than 300 members at his west Fort Worth club, Foster
can count his black clients on his fingers. Five are men, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Like health officials nationwide, he cannot explain why
African-Americans are less likely to exercise, especially when
almost 75 percent of professional athletes in football, baseball
and basketball are black. Experts surmise that economics may be
partly to blame. They also say that blacks may be more unwilling to
make a commitment to a healthful lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have to get people to see that there are real and
tangible benefits to exercising,'' says Dr. Nathan Stinson, acting
director of the Office of Minority Health in Washington D.C. ``It
goes beyond `I want to grow up and be a professional athlete.' We
have to tie it back to the real benefits this will have in how you
feel and how long you live.''
</P>
<P>
   Because exercise and nutrition have always been a part of
Foster's lifestyle, he says, he tries to extol its virtues to
others. Foster, who is a native of Trinidad, says that physical
activity was as much a part of his growing up as was eating fresh
vegetables from his parents' garden.
</P>
<P>
   When he moved to Texas in 1984, he didn't forget his upbringing.
In 1993, Foster opened Fazekes Gym on Vickery Boulevard, drawing
many of his clients _ doctors, lawyers, TV reporters and
schoolteachers _ from the clubs he had previously frequented.
</P>
<P>
   Once a small ``sweatshop'' stretching almost 3,000 square feet,
Fazekes has recently expanded to more than three times that size.
</P>
<P>
   But for all his success, Foster says he has been unable to draw
a large client pool from his own African-American community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that they don't support it,'' he says. ``They just
don't want to make the commitment to work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Monty Sproles and Jessie Guyden, both Fort Worth residents, are
exceptions to the rule.
</P>
<P>
   Sproles, 38, works out every day but Sunday. The regimen
started, he says, as part of a running competition with his older
brother while growing up in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wrestled, and he was always whipping me,'' Sproles says.
``He started working out, and in order for me to stay in
competition with him, I started to work out.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Guyden, 49, have 11 years between them at Fazekes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here for my health,'' says Guyden, who focuses his workout
on lifting weights. ``I want to look good, feel better and just
have a good outlook on life.''
</P>
<P>
   Both said, however, that most of their relatives are sedentary.
</P>
<P>
   Sproles has nine brothers and two sisters. Only four, he says,
work out regularly. Guyden has four siblings, none of whom works
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They like the way I look, but they don't want to pay the
cost,'' Guyden says.
</P>
<P>
   At Fazekes, Foster has tried to ease some of the financial
concerns by allowing members to use his club without a formal
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a contract, you have to pay whether you come or not,'' he
says. ``Without one, we give people the freedom to come and
hopefully convince you to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster believes that by adding a place for children, he can
expand the benefits of exercise to entire families.
</P>
<P>
   But Stinson says that educational messages about the benefits of
exercise aren't geared toward ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the problem has been many of the health education
programs have been devised as if one message fits all,'' he says.
``Messages have to be culturally appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Stinson says that people need to know that there's a direct
correlation between inactivity and diabetes and heart disease, both
of which affect the African-American community at disproportionate
rates.
</P>
<P>
   In some instances, however, officials say that people don't feel
safe enough in their communities to get out and be active.
</P>
<P>
   So in cities such as St. Louis, communities have partnered with
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to establish
walking trails in parks. In San Diego, schools are opening their
gymnasiums to the public after class.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Richardson, who recently moved to Dallas, has launched
walking clubs in cities such as Washington, D.C., Charlotte, N.C.,
and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do a community outreach program that targets all
women, but African-American women especially,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walking is for anyone. You can do it any time, anywhere. All
you need is a good pair of shoes. It's low-impact, burns lots of
calories and strengthens your heart and lungs.''
</P>
<P>
   She plans to launch five additional clubs by December in
Chicago, Orlando, Fla., New York, Los Angeles and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because time is precious, if we are going to make the
commitment to improve our health, it has to fit into our
lifestyle,'' Richardson says. ``And that might mean putting in a
video and working out at home, or taking a walk in the
neighborhood.'' .MDBO/.MDNM/ (Visit the Star-Telegram's online

P&AMP;G MOVES INTO PET FOODS WITH $2.3 BILLION PURCHASE OF IAMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)  (yn) 
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. is expanding its mix of top-selling brands
by acquiring Iams Co., the premium pet food maker, for $2.3
billion, the company said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, Procter &AMP; Gamble's largest acquisition in dollar
terms, moves the maker of Tide detergent and Crest toothpaste into
a market-leading position in the high end of the $25 billion pet
food market. And it is a significant first step in the company's
strategy to speed growth by diversifying beyond household cleaning
products, health and beauty aids and its other traditional
categories.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition combines the pet food maker's premium Iams and
Eukanuba brands of dog and cat food, and its expertise in pet
nutrition, with Procter &AMP; Gamble's global infrastructure and
manufacturing efficiency. In addition to increasing Iams
international business, which represents about 30 percent of
revenue, P&AMP;G said it would extend its scientific expertise in such
areas as skin and hair care, dental hygiene and bone and tooth
health to pet products.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say there will soon be a Crest for canines or a
conditioner for tackling fur balls. But the purchase of Iams, which
includes the assumption of $250 million in debt and is subject to
regulatory approval, ``will be an important contributor to
accelerating our growth,'' said Durk I. Jager, the president and
chief executive at Procter &AMP; Gamble. ``It fits well with P&AMP;G's
strengths, including expertise in health and nutrition.''
</P>
<P>
   Iams, based in Dayton, Ohio, has revenues of about $800 million
and has been growing an average of 16 percent for the past four
years. Iams is the second-leading brand behind a familiar P&AMP;G rival
_ the Colgate Palmolive Co., which makes Colgate toothpaste and
owns Hill's Pet Nutrition products. Both companies' pet food are
sold in specialty stores, pet supply shops and veterinary clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be tougher out there,'' said Robert Izmirlian,
an analyst with S&AMP;P Equity Group. ``Nobody's looking to cut prices,
but it's certainly going to be more challenging from a product
introduction standpoint and an advertising standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Clay Mathile, the chairman and owner of Iams, called the sale to
P&AMP;G a ``growth opportunity for our products and people.''
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble's last major acquisition was its purchase in
1997 of Tambrands Inc. for $2 billion. The company, which has
suffered from weakness in some foreign markets and a need for
bigger successes from new products, has said it expected to
increase long-term annual sales to 6 percent to 8 percent from 2
percent and that most of the growth would come from internal
innovation instead of acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were basically neutral on the transaction Wednesday,
likely because it will not contribute to earnings for three years.
The shares closed at $93.025, up 50 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that the purchase was a good strategic fit for
Procter &AMP; Gamble, and one that should pay off significantly in the
long term. ``It's a very solid acquisition for the company,'' said
William Steele, a managing director of Banc of America Securities.
``Procter is a collection of premium brands and Iams is a premium
brand in a category that's got global applications to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iams deal does more than increase P&AMP;G's presence in retail
aisles. It also reflects a new attitude at a notoriously
bureaucratic company that is streamlining its operations and
speeding product development as part of a global overhaul dubbed
``Organization 2005.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In our old structure, an idea like this would have been much
more difficult to bring to life,'' Jager said of the Iams deal.
``In Organization 2005, it took just 60 days, from the time we
first met with Iams management.'' &QL;

ANGRY AIR PASSENGER BECOMES RELUCTANT SYMBOL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Fla.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANNA WEISS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Her eyes damp with tears, Patricia Lemerise hung back
shyly from the cameras in an East Boston courthouse Wednesday. The
Miami resident, who admits to a fiery temper _ and was arrested
last week for swearing to flight attendants aboard an American
Airlines jet _ used a small, quiet voice to answer questions from
the press.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, she was surprised that her case, still unresolved after
Wednesday's hearing, had gone this far. Yes, she felt mistreated.
And a little nauseated. But she had no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being kind in the face of adversity is a virtue,'' she said.
But losing your patience, she said, is ``not necessarily a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, given the increasingly tense state of air travel _ when
more passengers are lashing out in anger and more airlines, in
response, are calling the police _ Lemerise's statement seems a
matter of debate.
</P>
<P>
   And Lemerise, 28, has become a reluctant symbol of the
unresolved question: When should frustration on a plane, expressed
in loud terms, be considered a criminal act?
</P>
<P>
   Lemerise, a Boston native, says mistreatment by crew members led
her to lash out on last Thursday's Miami-to-Boston flight. She says
she threatened no one. She believes her language, admittedly foul,
was protected by the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   But Margie Terrell, 45, a flight attendant on the plane, said
she had feared that Lemerise's belligerence would land her in jail.
Late in the flight, Terrell said, she knelt by Lemerise's row and
tried to calm her down.
</P>
<P>
   And had she not been working, Terrell said, she might have gone
a step further: ``I would have grabbed her and hugged her and said,
`Baby, please, don't get yourself into trouble.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Lemerise, who disputes Terrell's description of those events,
said the conflict on Flight 2024 began when she unrolled some
artwork in the aisle, blocking the meal cart. When a flight
attendant asked her to move, Lemerise walked to the First Class
cabin, where she said she grew increasingly upset as she waited for
the cart to pass.
</P>
<P>
   When she used the ``f'' word to a flight attendant, an argument
ensued that soon enveloped other people on the plane: an off-duty
pilot shouted at Lemerise; several passengers, sympathetic to the
flight attendants, offered their names as witnesses; one passenger
stood up in Lemerise's defense.
</P>
<P>
   And Lemerise continued to use foul language, several flight
attendants wrote in statements to the Suffolk County District
Attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``She created a huge disturbance in First Class and coach,''
flight attendant Nancy J. Romer wrote. ``People could hear her
yelling 10 rows away.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point, the captain alerted state police, who were
waiting, with handcuffs, at the airplane door. Lemerise was charged
with disorderly conduct and interfering with a flight crew. She
spent five hours in the airport barracks before she was released on
a $50 bond.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami resident, who has lived in Boston most of her life,
had hoped the case would be resolved Wednesday. But her attorney,
public defender Robert Simeone, said he could not reach an
agreeable plea-bargain with the District Attorney's office. He was
aiming, he said, for an agreement that would leave no mark on
Lemerise's criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   That record currently contains two earlier charges of assault
and battery and disorderly conduct that were dismissed, one the day
after the arrest. Both stem from an altercation with drunken Boston
University students outside a nightclub four years ago, Lemerise
said.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the district attorney's office appears to be
standing firm. In a statement, the office said Lemerise's ``uncivil
behavior interfered with the operations of the aircraft and
disturbed many of her fellow passengers.''
</P>
<P>
   District Judge Domenic Russo set another hearing in the case for
Sept. 8, but said Lemerise will not have to be present.
</P>
<P>
   Lemerise plans to return to Miami, to start a business as an art
dealer. In the meantime, she's contending with a flood of media
calls _ including an offer to appear on the Montel Williams show _
as her case becomes a popular example of the ``air rage'' trend.
</P>
<P>
   As complaints about air carriers have risen in recent months, so
have complaints of passenger misconduct. Several major airlines,
expressing concern, have touted strict policies of punishment. Two
insurance agencies recently began offering ``rage insurance''
policies, which cover part of the cost of diverting a plane in
response to an unruly passenger.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance agent Don Kenny, whose New York-based Frank Crystal &AMP;
Co. offers one of those policies, said his product also covers
emergency landings due to bomb scares, medical emergencies, and the
weather and maintenance problems that account, by far, for most
unplanned landings.
</P>
<P>
   But it's rage, he said, that grabs the airlines' attention. And
it's rage, said Cynthia Kain, spokeswoman for the Association of
Flight Attendants, that has led more flight attendants to complain
about conditions in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Several attendants on Lemerise's flight said they felt
threatened by her anger, and by her words. Though Lemerise wasn't
physically violent, Terrell said, her words still had an effect on
the crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``This young lady was very strong with her mouth,'' Terrell
said. ``She didn't touch nobody, but you know, sometimes you don't
have to touch someone'' to hurt him, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one flight attendant, who asked that her name not be
used, said it was state police _ not the flight crew _ who decided
to arrest Lemerise, when the flight ended and her anger did not
subside.
</P>
<P>
   But Lemerise, who contends that she was mistreated by the crew,
said she had a hunch she'd be arrested before the flight landed.
The news, she said, came from a small girl, traveling alone, who
spoke to a flight attendant and then to Lemerise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you don't have to spend a lot of time in jail,'' the
little girl said, ``and you get a really good jury.''

STIPE AND REM BANDMATES GET BACK TO BASICS ON TOUR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By FRED SHUSTER 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _  &UR; T &LR; here were few transcendent moments but much to
admire during R.E.M.'s oddly paced set Monday at the Greek Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia-based band opened the U.S. leg of its tour with a
greatest-hits show that bounced between ballads and rockers,
keeping fans alternately sitting or standing as slow tunes followed
fast numbers.
</P>
<P>
   It was indeed satisfying to see the influential folk-pop outfit
at Griffith Park's relaxed open-air venue instead of a sports
stadium. In fact, it was almost a return to the heady days of 1991,
when ``Losing My Religion'' sparked the upward turn that resulted
in R.E.M. becoming one of the most popular working bands in the
world by the ``Monster'' arena trek of the mid-'90s.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it appears the group has scaled back and is returning to
where it all began, a move apparently precipitated by dwindling
audience and poor record sales. R.E.M., to borrow the title of one
of its albums, finally seems ``Out of Time.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, enigmatic singer Michael Stipe and company plainly believe
in what they're doing, and the trio _ augmented Monday by frequent
tour drummer Joey Waronker and a couple of road hands who traded
off between second guitar and keyboards _ still put forth
passionate, frequently haunting music.
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights of the engaging if uneven set where
exciting readings of ``The Wake-Up Bomb'' and the gentle ``E-Bow
the Letter,'' both from R.E.M.'s underrated 1996 effort ``New
Adventures in Hi-Fi.''
</P>
<P>
   A subdued ``Man on the Moon,'' which Stipe dedicated to ``our
friend Milos'' (as in Forman, director of the forthcoming film on
late comic Andy Kaufman, subject of the song), and the 1993 Top 40
hit ``Everybody Hurts'' had the members of the audience ignoring
their cell phones as they swayed and sang softly along.
</P>
<P>
   Guitarist Peter Buck was the driving force behind the more
uptempo numbers, including ``The One I Love'' and ``Crush With
Eyeliner,'' and those in the first few rows formed a chardonnay-
and espresso-fueled mosh pit of sorts. No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Stipe appeared alone on stage with an acoustic guitar for the
start of the encore, at first warning the crowd he was just
learning the instrument. He haltingly accompanied himself on a soft
ballad before offering a few lines of the Smashing Pumpkins song
``Disarm,'' announcing that Pumpkins leader Billy Corgan was a
close friend and among the era's best songwriters.
</P>
<P>
   R.E.M. _ appearing tonight at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre _ may
not still be on rock's cutting edge. But as long as there's a
market for emotional, well-crafted folk-tinged pop, Stipe and the
gang will have jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Opening the show was Mercury Rev, the avant-pop group from
Buffalo, N.Y., whose ``Deserter's Songs'' graced many best-of lists
at the end of last year. The group's melodies and Neil
Young-inspired harmonies were impressive, although the venue was
only partially filled when the band went on stage. &UR;  &QL;

BLUE CROSS PLANS NON-REFERRAL HMO PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In a joke in the managed care world, a new patient
asks his health maintenance organization how hard it will be to
choose his own specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: slightly more difficult than choosing your parents.
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to consumers who are increasingly fed up with HMO red
tape, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts is coming out
with an HMO that requires no referrals for patients who want
specialty care.
</P>
<P>
   By doing away with referrals, a fundamental tool of managed care
and one of its most villified, Blue Cross hopes to attract new
subscribers _ roughly 135,000 members within five years _ to its
Access Blue HMO, according to Alan S. Rosenberg, vice president of
marketing for Blue Cross.
</P>
<P>
   The catch: Patients will have a $30 copayment every time they
see one of Blue Cross' network of 7,500 specialists. The copayment
is triple the average physician copayment, which typically is about
$10.
</P>
<P>
   Visits to primary care physicians, obstetricians, and
gynecologists will carry a lower $10 copayment. Preventive
services, such as annual physicals and prenatal care, have no
copayment.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross will continue to sell its standard HMO Blue
insurance, which requires referrals and charges a $5 physician
copayment.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of Access Blue, Rosenberg said, is to encourage people
to emphasize preventive and primary care, which can help save money
in the long run by preventing hospitalization, while making them
think twice before they rush to a specialist.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to go directly to a specialist is catching on across
the country, with HMOs such as Aetna US Health Care and United
Healthcare Corp. offering so-called ``open access'' plans in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   While Blue Cross says it is the only insurance company in the
state to offer an HMO without referral requirements, in reality
patients have had that option for many years, just not in a pure
HMO. They can, for example, pay higher premiums for a preferred
provider organization, or PPO, that lets them seek specialty care
without needing a referral from a primary care physician.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross maintains Access Blue is different because premiums
for the HMO will be just 3 percent to 5 percent higher than for a
traditional HMO, while PPOs cost about 10 percent more.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers have shown they will pay for more freedom. In 1998,
enrollment in HMOs dropped for the first time, although only
slightly, according to Susan Connolly, a principal at William M.
Mercer Inc., a benefits consulting firm in Boston. Meanwhile, PPOs
grew from being 25 percent of the commercial health insurance
market to 40 percent between 1994 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross' enrollment figures reflect that trend. In the first
six months of this year, Blue Cross' PPO membership swelled by 71
percent, while its HMO grew by less than 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are saying, `We want choice,' '' Connolly said.
</P>
<P>
   But the move is not without risk for Blue Cross, which has just
recently dug itself out of a steep financial hole after reporting
large losses in 1996, according to industry observers.
</P>
<P>
   With fewer restrictions over specialty care, Blue Cross may face
a stampede of patients seeking specialty care, thereby driving up
medical costs, said Robert Hoehn, a health care analyst with ING
Barings LLC in New York. Direct access to specialists goes against
one of the principles of managed care _ having a primary care
physician cut costs by weeding out unnecessary care.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross also faces the possibility of having only sick
patients sign up, driving up costs, a phenomenon known in the
insurance world as ``adverse selection,'' Hoehn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be difficult to make money on a product like this,''
said Hoehn.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anne L. Meneghetti, associate medical director at Blue
Cross, argues that Access Blue will attract healthy members who
like not having any copayments for preventive care, and chronically
ill patients who want direct access to their specialists. Blue
Cross will still be able to control costs, she argued, by
continuing to require patients to get permission for expensive or
experimental procedures, such as infertility treatment, home health
care, and certain prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Rosenberg said he doesn't expect the product to
catch on like wild fire. ``We're expecting modest, not huge, growth
from this product,'' he said.

 &HT;    Violence in schools boosted awareness
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. _ Pam Riley, executive director of the Center for
the Prevention of School Violence, based in Raleigh, N.C., has
responded to more than 1,000 inquiries since April. School
administrators and teachers, parents and students are seeking
advice on violence-prevention programs after the shootings at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. Staff writer Chris
Burritt talked to Riley, 50, about efforts to combat violence in
the new school year.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has been the general reaction among people you've talked
to?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think there has been a growing awareness that schools are
no longer immune to guns, drugs and violence in our communities.
Schools must plan for safety in order to have environments that are
conducive to learning.
</P>
<P>
   What we have been doing over the summer is responding to
requests from school districts and communities to help them with
comprehensive safe-school planning. We have been concentrating on
three areas: prevention, intervention and crisis response.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have you seen a quick reaction by schools to install metal
detectors and other security devices? Are they enough of a
precaution?
</P>
<P>
   A: We are seeing schools address the physical environment.
Certainly, it's reasonable for principals to have surveillance
cameras and even hand-held metal detectors. But we also need to
balance that with the people relationships. When we think about
some of the incidents over the past couple of years, many of the
causes had to do with bullying or intimidation. Having a metal
detector isn't necessarily going to help you address that problem.
</P>
<P>
   We have to ask, how do you provide in that school a climate of
comfort and trust so that young people feel comfortable doing the
right thing? How do you create an atmosphere where teaching and
learning can take place without fear and intimidation?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Generally speaking, do students feel safe?
</P>
<P>
   A: Fewer students feel safe at schools. But actually schools are
very safe places. Some 40 percent of our schools report zero crime
to law enforcement. But, as we have seen with violence in the
workplace, too, no place is immune. What we have to say is there
are no guarantees. Talk with young people and show them what we are
doing to ensure we have the safest environment possible and that we
are decreasing the likelihood of a tragic incident at that school.

CANADA SEIZES SHIP CARRYING CHINESE TO BRITISH COLUMBIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ After a dramatic high seas chase, Canadian patrol
ships intercepted another nameless and flagless fishing trawler
Wednesday carrying Chinese boat people to a remote landing site on
British Columbia. It was the second suspected human smuggling
vessel in less than a month apprehended on seas off the western
province.
</P>
<P>
   Although Canadian military planes and warships had tracked the
vessel for two days, the smugglers managed to offload about 150
men, women and children at wave-lashed Gilbert Bay on the Queen
Charlotte Islands before their vessel was captured. The vessel was
first spied on Monday on a suspicious course 150 miles from the
Canadian shore.
</P>
<P>
   The unregistered ship was seized trying to make a desperate
escape in storm-lashed seas, according to the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police.
</P>
<P>
   Of the suspected illegal immigrants who so hastily scrambled to
shore, RCMP Constable Tracey Rook said all were in custody, along
with the alleged smugglers. ``They are very wet, very cold. It's
very stormy weather,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese gangs engaged in hugely profitable human commerce are
increasingly using Canada as the gateway to North America because
of its lax refugee rules. Illegal immigrants who falsely proclaim
themselves ``refugees'' _ that is, claim to be victims of political
persecution as a ruse for entering a new country _ are almost
invariably permitted to remain in Canada to argue their case, a
process that can take years, even decades.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's loose policy is becoming a serious problem for the
United States, since most of the illegal immigrants are bound for
American cities and simply using Canada as the easiest route.
</P>
<P>
   The rusted vessel apprehended Wednesday flew no flag and its
name was painted over, but officials presume it originated in
China's Fujian Province. That is the suspected origin of a similar
vessel intercepted July 19 off Vancouver Island jammed with 123
Chinese, nearly all males, none of whom carried identifiction. All
claimed to be refugees upon reaching Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Most have since been released by authorities even though
Canadian police are convinced they are simply ecomomic adventurers,
not true refugees. Such illegal immigrants are in effect jumping
the long waiting lists of Chinese and other foreigners trying to
legally emigrate to Canada or the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Canada is not their true destination in most cases. A
majority of illegal immigrants from Asia, especially China, use
Canada as little more than a convenient stopover to American
cities, Canadian officials concede.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where most are definitely headed,'' said Staff Sgt.
Glen Rockwell of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, supervisior of
the RCMP's British Columbia immigration unit, who like many police
and increasing numbers of citizens is critical of Canada's policy
of not even positively determining the identity of illegal
immigrants before setting them free.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a major detention center where people can be held a
longer time and (police can) determine who they really are,''
Rockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Of 2,462 Chinese nationals who claimed refugee status upon
illegally entering Canada over the past two years, 1,229 simply
disappeared and are assumed to have sneaked across the porous
US-Canada border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canada is a nice place, but the US is the land of milk and
honey,'' said Catherine Sas, a Vancouver immigration lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Smugglers see little risk in routing their human cargo through
Canada since anyone who claims refugee status will likely be
released and even awarded a $500-a-month government stipend while
his or her claim is processed.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States and Australia, two other countries that are
affected by increasing numbers of illegal immigrants from Asia,
such people are most often detained and deported.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's uncommonly lax immigration rules are finally coming
under domestic fire from politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe none of these people should be let loose in this
country,'' said John Reynolds, a member of Canadian Parliament
reprsenting a district in British Columbia. ``The law has got to be
changed. we've got to stop it or it's just going to explode.''
</P>
<P>
   But Canada's minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Elinor
Caplan, portrayed illegal immigrants as victims smuggled across the
Pacific in unsafe vessels by greedy criminal rings. Immigrants
typically pay $35,000 to $50,000 for the passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The well-being of people who take such a dangerous course to
Canada has to be a concern,'' she told an Ottawa news conference.

 &HT;    Huddle House cooks up three-state deal
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Huddle House Inc. has reached a deal with a Lexington,
Ky.-based company to expand into a three-state area.
</P>
<P>
   Philip M. Greifeld, president and chief executive officer of the
chain, said the deal with Thomas and King Inc. is to build 70
restaurants over the next decade. The Kentucky firm owns 63
Applebee's in seven states.
</P>
<P>
   The deal represents one of the largest single franchising
agreements for the company, which was formed about 35 years ago.

   ``We're really excited about this. These guys are terrific
operators,'' said Greifeld, who joined the company as its chief
financial officer in 1995. ``These are terrific times ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Greifeld said the move gives Huddle House an inroad into two new
markets, Ohio and Indiana. The deal also calls for Huddle Houses to
open in Kentucky, where several are already located. Traditionally,
the company's stronghold has been the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Greifeld said the company's strategy includes adding more
co-branded units with convenience stores, fuel centers and travel
plazas and striking new deals with franchisees.
</P>
<P>
   The first restaurant is scheduled to open in Lexington within
the next six months. All the Thomas and King units would be
free-standing restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Scanlon, president and chief executive officer of Thomas
and King Inc., said the company was looking for a second restaurant
concept.
</P>
<P>
   Huddle House ``is just poised to grow,'' said Scanlon. ``They're
an old company in a new beginning right now ... and we want to be a
part.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Huddle House decided to revamp its image and expand
its customer base with a new look, new menu and advertising
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A diner-style chain, Huddle House has 335 restaurants in a dozen
states.

<P>
   MARSHALLTOWN, Iowa _ Lamar Alexander is trying hard to stay
positive while he runs out of money. ``We're just beginning,''
Alexander insists, six-and-a-half years into his presidential run,
on another day spent driving across the state to share a sack lunch
or a bowl of ice cream with a tiny handful of mostly long-time
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   But his bitter belief that the Republican Party's whole
nominating process is being short-circuited by big money and big
media has become a consuming preoccupation. And in these last days
before Saturday's straw poll in Ames, where even supporters say he
needs a surprising show of strength to survive, his appearances
have turned into extended warnings that not only his candidacy but
a whole way of political life is in danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be the last Iowa caucus,'' he says at nearly every
stop. ``Now you can just come into the airport, buy a few bales of
hay, pretend you know Iowa and have the media proclaim you the
winner. You don't need to bother with picking a president because
it's not your business anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, the straw poll is an unfair measurement, because
its votes are literally bought and paid for. But as Alexander
acknowledges, it is an indication of early organizational strength,
and can energize or end a candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   All of the other Republican campaigns have shown a certain
amount of exasperation at their party's rush to bankroll Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, at least in part in reaction to its dutiful, doomed
nomination of former Sen. Bob Dole in 1996. Former Vice President
Dan Quayle's wife, Marilyn, recently lashed out, calling Bush a
``party frat-boy type.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one has been running harder or longer than Alexander, who
served two terms as governor of Tennessee and was later the U.S.
secretary of education under Bush's father, President George Bush.
Alexander has not held any other full-time job since he left
Washington in January 1993. And he is leading the field in
complaining that Bush and his money are subverting the system.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the podium, Alexander's resentment is even more
pronounced. Surfing wave upon wave of Iowa cornfields in a borrowed
van, he denounced the front-runner in a way that was remarkable not
for its viciousness, but for its volume.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander is a serious man, known for improving Tennessee's
schools and economy, as well as for the plaid shirt he has finally
ditched. In 1996, he had an encouraging third-place finish in both
the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. That same year,
President Clinton told friends that Alexander was the Republican he
most feared running against.
</P>
<P>
   He has been to Iowa so often he would surely win the upcoming
straw poll if it were awarded after a pop quiz on the state. But he
is almost broke _ with just $91,000 on hand, compared with Bush's
$30 million in the bank _ and has already laid off staff members.
Everywhere, he fields only one real question from reporters who
just want to know: When is the wake?
</P>
<P>
   Jim Beckner, a Nashville lawyer who has raised money for
Alexander in past years, said he had stopped trying, explaining:
``Most of his supporters were saying, `Last time I gave out of
enthusiasm, but this time, show me some reality.'''
</P>
<P>
   After Alexander left the governor's mansion in 1987, he took his
family to Australia for six months, to reflect and reconnect. In
his memoir of that trip, ``Six Months Off,'' he describes the
chemical reaction that occurs when voters fall for a candidate _ in
this case, him, as he walked across Tennessee in his second race
for governor:
</P>
<P>
   ``The thousand-mile walk, day after day, became my metronome, a
practiced discipline that infused me with the music of the lives of
the people I sought to serve. I knew I was in my groove _ or was it
their groove? I began to radiate the glow of a winning candidate.
For the first time ever, I possessed that incandescence that voters
see in a candidate with a sense of purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of that rosy glow is conferred by cash, and with both
Bush and Steve Forbes outspending him 10-to-1 on the straw poll
alone, even friends are saying this does not seem to be Alexander's
turn to be incandescent: ``Why does a lousy restaurant sometimes
have a line down the block and people knocking to get in?'' Beckner
said. ``Who knows? Politics is like that, too. He's very
intelligent, wonderful background, but for whatever reason, he just
has not caught on.''
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of pulling off a surprise Saturday, Alexander,
traveling with his national chairman, former Iowa Gov. Terry
Branstad, is trying to hit 64 of the state's 99 counties, fairly
begging folks to strike a blow for the little guy through the straw
poll. (He is also offering free T-shirts, dinner and a mini-concert
by the singer Crystal Gayle, not to mention transportation in an
air-conditioned bus, in all, ``a $25 value.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But people show no sign that they share his frustration. When he
told members of the Pachyderm political club in Marshalltown, to
remember that ``there is no Ronald Reagan in this race, and no
George Bush, either,'' nobody laughed. Afterwards, a couple of
people said they thought he seemed a little negative, and two
others thought he might make a fine vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like all of the Republican candidates, but I think Bush can
win,'' said Bill Egleston, who runs a mail order business here.
``Anyway, the money goes to benefit the Iowa Republican Party, so
Iowans should be happy about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, though, spends considerable energy unhappily working
and reworking his own feelings about the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's relying on celebrity and money while I'm relying on hard
work and issues,'' Alexander said, clenching ed his fist, his voice
tightening, over bacon and eggs at a coffee shop in New Hampton,
``Governor Bush has been here three times, all in the last month.
It's all built on image and on sand! All the people he's talking to
are screened!''
</P>
<P>
   On a long drive to lunch in Vinton, he mocked Bush's attempts to
speak Spanish. ``Bush says, `Todos los ninos must be educated,'
Alexander said, trying a Texas twang. ``I can do that!''
</P>
<P>
   Passing near Waterloo, Iowa, he remarked: ``In the real
Waterloo, there's a statue of Napoleon that says, `Whenever I see a
throne, I have an urge to sit on it.' I've known a lot of people
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   And that evening, before tucking into a comfort-food
extravaganza of turkey, dressing and a chocolate shake, Alexander
observed: ``We've had an overdose of charisma. You don't beat Al
Gore trying to sound like Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   When Alexander is not on the subject of Bush, his ideas come
through much more clearly. At dinner with a few aides and
reporters, amid a discussion about how much television is suitable
for children, he recalled struggling with the question of at what
age he should let his children read of the evil of the Holocaust in
Elie Wiesel's ``Night.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he said: ``It all boils down to something that may be more
profound than what we can deal with in a presidential race. How do
people know the difference between right and wrong and why it's
getting harder, with the culture getting coarser and institutions
weaker? That's the issue with Clinton and that's the issue with all
these shootings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole debate has gotten off track,'' he went on,
``because our party gets off on family values and issues including
abortion and gay rights and other things that quickly get us off
track, instead of talking about how we can arm parents to teach
their children.''
</P>
<P>
   His central message is that he wants to improve schools and make
life easier for parents in a number of ways, including tax breaks.
For the rest of the evening, he seemed energized.
</P>
<P>
   But the next morning, back in the van, someone had seen a copy
of a political obituary for Alexander in The New Republic, and
after a few lines were quoted to him, he got quiet. Then, for
probably the 10th time in 24 hours, a reporter from Alexander's
home state of Tennessee repeated the same question: ``So, would you
say this is make or break for you?''
</P>
<P>
   In response, with his voice rising a little, he said, ``The real
question isn't the money people but the media. Typically, you wait
for a race to start before declaring a winner. The press has
traditionally given at least three tickets out of the Iowa caucus.
Now at least they ought to give three out of the straw poll.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, as his van pulled into the parking lot of his
Des Moines headquarters, he tried once more. ``I would just like to
say that the whole purpose of what we do between now and the end of
the year is to come in in the top three,'' he said. ``That's what
the competition was all about.''

LOSS OF CALDER SCULPTURE IS A REALITY CHECK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ It was uncanny, the way those two pictures
on the front of last Wednesday's paper _ pictures of Alexander
Calder's ``Eagle'' _ just happened to have been taken from the same
angle. One was a ``Star-Telegram'' file photo of the sculpture. The
other was shot by a Philadelphia photographer.
</P>
<P>
   One picture showed the Calder wedged at the foot of a downtown
Fort Worth office building, where the work had stood for 25 years.
The other had ``Eagle'' surmounting the steps in front of the
Philadelphia Museum of Art. And it was apparent, just barely, that
the sculpture's legs in the Philadelphia picture were longer _
restored after having been cut off when the Calder was installed in
Fort Worth in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Add up those differences, and they amount to an artwork that
looks much happier where it is now.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, ``Eagle'' is in Philadelphia only temporarily. On Feb.
1, it comes down again, and whoever owns it will move it somewhere
else.
</P>
<P>
   Which means that those of us who still resent its loss from Fort
Worth mentally must move on, as well. We need to get past selfish
disappointment and consider the big picture. The ``Eagle'' affair
represents some major cultural issues and some important lessons to
learn. To wit:
</P>
<P>
   Justifiable anger, pride and 25 years of familiarity are not
enough to keep an artwork in place. The art market and the rights
of private property owners are forces that cannot be ignored, just
because we don't like what they can do.
</P>
<P>
   Sentiment isn't always the best attitude to assume toward an
artwork _ not when it excuses damaging the piece for the sake of
convenience: After all, how many of us would cut an end off ``The
Card Sharps'' just to fit it into a particular frame?
</P>
<P>
   Even granting that Fort Worth's sesquicentennial year is a
special time to celebrate the past, we don't want to make the
mistake of seeking refuge there. Admittedly, when a group of
bankers brought the Calder here 25 years ago, they may have been
too determined to prove Fort Worth was more than a simple cowtown.
</P>
<P>
   Once we finish celebrating 150 years of western heritage, we
need to restore balance to our cultural identity. The new Amon
Carter Museum and Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth will do a lot to
get us on track. But Fort Worth needs a percent-for-art fund (as
does Dallas) that supports commission of major, site-specific,
contemporary artworks for sites citywide. Relying as heavily as we
have on private donors has resulted in a few pieces of real quality
and several works of astounding mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   The first artwork we need to commission is one that symbolically
succeeds the Calder, that is of recognized artistic significance _
but also is better located than the Calder was.
</P>
<P>
   My recommendation? Let's honor a significant aspect of our
cultural heritage by commissioning Luis Jimenez to create one of
his fabulous, insightful expressions of Latino reality.
</P>
<P>
   We had a chance four years ago to keep the Calder and have it
suitably resituated. John Runyon, the broker handling its sale,
approached some obvious prospects, including Modern Art Museum
director Marla Price.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the sale was discussed years ago, we said we would like
to have right of first refusal if they did decide to sell it,''
Price said. ``But the thing was taken off the market, so there
wasn't even an opportunity to bring it to our acquisitions
committee and discuss it officially.''
</P>
<P>
   We should have known better, but we're not alone in our naivete.
It happens that Philadelphia lost a major work by Ellsworth Kelly
in much the same way we lost the ``Eagle.'' The Kelly, an abstract
wall relief measuring more than 64 feet long, had been commissioned
for the lobby of a downtown Philly office building. Installed in
1957, it was the first piece of abstract public sculpture in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   But the building eventually was vacated and fenced off, with the
artwork languishing inside. The artist started worrying about it.
Eventually, Kelly contacted his New York dealer, Matthew Marks.
</P>
<P>
   Marks looked into the matter and, without further ado, quietly
purchased the artwork for a reported $100,000-$300,000. He
exhibited it in his Chelsea gallery and sold it for about $1
million to patrons of the Museum of Modern Art, who gave it to the
museum where it now resides.
</P>
<P>
   Even art insiders like Philadelphia museum director Anne
d'Harnoncourt were stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say that it never even occurred to me that it could
be removed or moved. Never,'' she told the Philadelphia Inquirer
last winter.
</P>
<P>
   But Philadelphia city official Diane Dalto told the
Star-Telegram last week: ``We all have to wake up to the fact that
this can happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have a group of concerned citizens, art people and
historians trying to figure how to monitor art that is privately
owned but, in a way, belongs to the public,'' said Dalto, who is
Philadelphia's first representative for arts and culture.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, she said, cities need to obtain the right of
first refusal when a work is considered for sale and then be
organized to act upon opportunities when they arise.
</P>
<P>
   The economic impact of art tourism plays an increasingly
important role in U.S. municipalities _ and cities and towns are
paying more attention to historic preservation and enhancing their
cultural identities.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, then, imagine how thrilling it would be for a
city to land a museum devoted to Alexander Calder _ who may stand
alone among American artists in his critical and popular success.
Or, to put it another way, think of a Calder museum as a
major-league sports team. And think of the keepers of Calder's
legacy as team owners who are playing select cities against one
another, enticing them with the prospect of landing such a museum
and waiting to see who'll put up the most money.
</P>
<P>
   The team owners are Calder's grandsons Holton and Sandy Rower _
Sandy is head of the Calder Foundation _ and the cities they've
been considering include Paris, San Francisco, New York and, yes,
Philadelphia. The Rowers are probably more interested in one of the
other three. But they nonetheless persuaded the owner of the
``Eagle'' to lend it to Philadelphia _ and, in the few days since
its placement, Philly has become feverishly interested in the
possibility of a Calder museum.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just why our former Calder's new owner is letting the
Rowers trot his artwork from city to city remains a mystery. But
one thing is clear: The ``Eagle'' has a new life, one we hope is to
its benefit.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is this, clear and cruel: Art is an exalted
expression of the human spirit. And art is a commodity.

COMMENTARY: ANY DAY NOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also NY-CLINTONS-HOUSE) 
(jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The presumed candidate sits serenely before her
specially invited audience. She nods every now and then. When she
speaks, it's mostly platitudes, delivered in a monotone. There is
no feeling of spontaneity, no sense of Hillary Rodham Clinton
descending from her privileged status as first lady into the real
world of the people she hopes to represent in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   She flies in, hurries from one appearance to another, then flies
back to her world. There was a report Wednesday night that the
Clintons may be interested in a house in Greenburgh, in Westchester
County. If that's true, it's not a moment too soon.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who think the carpetbagger problem is no big
deal. They are deluded. I hear Democratic voters speaking
resentfully about it all the time. A typical comment is: ``Who does
she think she's fooling with that Yankee cap?''
</P>
<P>
   When Robert Kennedy won his Senate seat in 1964 he ran nearly
two million votes behind Lyndon Johnson, who carried the state by
2.7 million votes in his landslide victory over Barry Goldwater.
Arthur Schlesinger Jr. reminds us that even though Kennedy ran far
behind the president, he was ``greatly helped'' by Johnson's
landslide. Mrs. Clinton will have nothing like those coattails to
hang onto.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday the first lady made an appearance in the
Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. The stop was part of her
fifth ``listening tour'' of New York and her first appearance
before a mostly black audience.
</P>
<P>
   Bed-Stuy is an area she will carry with approximately 100
percent of the vote. The residents like her, and there is no way to
overstate their dislike of Rudolph Giuliani. But Mrs. Clinton needs
even more than 100 percent of the vote from neighborhoods like
Bed-Stuy. She needs huge turnouts. And to get them she'll have to
do what she's not doing now _ roll up her sleeves, step forward and
begin to honestly and openly cultivate the voters. Like Robert
Kennedy, who offered the gift of hope and was revered in Bed-Stuy,
Mrs. Clinton will have to give the people a reason to be excited
about her.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for the rest of the state, which will be a much
harder sell than Bed-Stuy. I suspect that when the snooze-a-thon
listening tours mercifully end, Mrs. Clinton and her advisers will
try to come up with other ways to shield her as much as possible
from the rough-and-tumble of politics in New York.
</P>
<P>
   That would be understandable. There are sharks in these waters.
Just ask Rep. Rick Lazio, who was pressured by state Republicans
leaders not to challenge Giuliani for the senatorial nomination.
But it would be a mistake. At some point the real Hillary Clinton
will have to emerge. Running for the Senate is not for the
inauthentic or the faint of heart, and it can't be done from afar.
</P>
<P>
   I keep hearing that there's a lot of time until the election.
Forget it. Each passing day is a lost opportunity. Mrs. Clinton has
got to work this entire enormous state, and she has to generate the
kind of enthusiasm that will translate into big poll numbers,
especially among women and ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, a number of things look problematic for Mrs.
Clinton. One, the Republicans are getting their act together and
uniting behind Giuliani, who is already popular upstate, in the
suburbs and, ominously for any Democrat, in the city. Two, whenever
Mrs. Clinton establishes a residence here, speculation about the
state of her marriage will soar. Fair or not, that will feed into
the very real problem of Clinton fatigue. And three, there is
already grumbling among blacks in New York City (Al Sharpton _
remember him?) that Mrs. Clinton, like her husband in 1992, may try
to finesse the black vote. That is, she may dance at arm's length
with the black electorate _ close enough to win black votes, but
not so close that she offends white voters.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for Giuliani's popularity (there is general
agreement that it's not his personality) is the sense that he has
taken control of the city and improved the quality of life. There
is no sense yet that Mrs. Clinton is in control of anything. I'm
learning, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's time to get rid of that script. Tell us that you're
running for the Senate, and tell us why. Show us the real Hillary
Clinton. Coyness never won anything in New York.  &QL;

EASTSIDE RESERVOIR NEARLY COMPLETE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM MATTHEWS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMET, Calif. _ ``Coming soon under a bass boat near you, the
state's greatest largemouth bass lake, where a world record is
possible. Probable even!''
</P>
<P>
   ``About to be released for downrigger and lead-core-line
fanatics, a rainbow trout fishery that will put Montana to shame.''
</P>
<P>
   These could be marquees for the Eastside Reservoir project, the
Metropolitan Water District's new water-storage facility that is
nearing completion.
</P>
<P>
   Located near Hemet in Southwest Riverside County, it is expected
to be filled starting Dec. 3 and opened to the public in the summer
of 2001. And it won't take long before Eastside Reservoir will be
the fishery all others in the region are judged against, living up
to its impressive marquee billing.
</P>
<P>
   How are officials so sure Eastside will become the premier
freshwater fishery in the region? Because it is being constructed
that way.
</P>
<P>
   It's not often a fishery is built from the ground up, but that
is exactly what the Department of Fish and Game biologist Mike
Giusti has been doing with the Eastside Reservoir project. It has
never been done this way before, and the MWD contracted with the
DFG to have Giusti devote his time to designing a fishery
enhancement-and-management plan.
</P>
<P>
   Giusti's simple goal is to make the mammoth impoundment _ with
26 miles of shoreline, 4,500 surface acres and a depth as great as
250 feet, it could fit Silverwood, Perris, Skinner and Castaic
lakes inside it _ as good a fishery as possible within the
constraints of a $250,000 annual budget through 2025. Among the
highlights:
</P>
<P>
   Creation of habitat: Giusti has designated 12 areas of the lake
for habitat-improvement projects, covering 50-60 percent of the
shoreline areas. The habitat consists of brush piles, most made
with orange trees, rock piles and 100-foot-long rock berms or dikes
with adjacent channels.
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude of the habitat work is as dazzling as the dam
project itself. There are thousands of pieces of structure, with an
estimated 3,000-4,000 orange trees needed to create the brush
piles.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the structure will be placed from 35-70 feet below the
full level of the reservoir, with some to as deep as 125 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Above 35 feet, (the MWD staff) are concerned with the
aesthetics of exposed habitat when there is low water, but I'm
still working with them on that,'' said Giusti. ``I'm trying to get
it so whatever they do with the lake level, we'll have good
habitat.''
</P>
<P>
   Bass fishermen should note that every piece of structure will be
mapped in detail, including exact GPS coordinates.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced species: Fifty Florida-strain largemouth bass were
added to an existing population of bluegill and redear sunfish in
the facility's 80-acre pond. Once the reservoir is filled, much
more of the same will be added, along with blue and channel catfish
and rainbow trout. Forage species will include tule perch, signal
crawfish and red swamp crawfish.
</P>
<P>
   Future additions: Giusti said that threadfin shad and
silversides are not being introduced initially. ``There is a
misconception about shad being a benefit to the fishery at first,''
he said. ``Because they spawn about two weeks earlier than bass,
the availability of photoplankton and zooplankton is reduced. If
you put them in initially, they overpopulate and other species are
affected.'' Therefore, shad and silversides will go in as forage
fish after game species have become established.
</P>
<P>
   Other later additions may include spotted bass, crappie, green
sunfish, warmouth, brown trout, mackinaw (lake) trout, kokanee
salmon, chinook salmon and walleye.
</P>
<P>
   Water-level management: While management of Eastside will not be
manipulated to benefit the fishery, it will work out that way.
Unlike other Southland water-supply reservoirs that often are in
the phase of losing water when the warmwater species are moving
shallow to spawn, Eastside will generally be coming up slowly
during spawning time. Therefore, the lake can store large amounts
of water into the summer when it is needed the most.
</P>
<P>
   Boat use: There has been a controversy brewing over whether
certain types of engines will be allowed because of a fuel additive
that pollutes water supplies with higher emission rates. New
standards for engines adopted by the California Air Resources Board
and the banning of the fuel additive will probably make the
controversy moot, however. There will be a maximum speed
restriction; personal watercraft and water-skiing are banned
because body contact will not be allowed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When you see the amount of effort being put into this fishery,
you want to keep pinching yourself to make sure it's for real. It's
difficult to shake the fantasy-like quality of the whole project.
</P>
<P>
   For fishermen, however, the reality is that within two or three
years after being filled, the bass and trout fishery should be
outstanding at Eastside Reservoir. Within seven or eight years,
anglers will be looking to crank out an elusive world-record
largemouth because of genetics and an aggressive trout-stocking
program.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, Eastside might even rival Twin Lakes for browns, Lake
Perris for bluegill, Utah and Wyoming's Flaming Gorge for mackinaw
and all of Minnesota for walleye.

MENTORS FACE CHALLENGING ROLE IN TODAY'S SOCIETY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAYCE T. ATAIYERO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The world was a much gentler place when Stanley
Richmond was growing up in Roxbury. As a little brother in the
Jewish Big Brother and Big Sister Association in 1955, his biggest
concern was how his family was going to survive financially after
the death of his father.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as a big brother, Richmond sees children facing issues
that are much different, and often more difficult and potentially
life-threatening, issues that are forcing Big Brothers Big Sisters
organizations to change their approach in trying to move kids away
from negative influences.
</P>
<P>
   This week, hundreds of members of the decades-old group are
meeting in Boston in search of a new agenda. They will focus on
such issues as school violence, drugs, domestic abuse, and Internet
pornography.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am now with my fourth little brother and I see that it is
much harder for him than it was for me,'' said Richmond, 56. ``The
crime, the drugs, the violence are things that I had no concept of
then. It would have scared me. It scares me now.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Lowell, executive director of the Jewish Big Brothers and
Big Sisters of Boston, the oldest of the Boston organizations, said
society presents challenges that are more complex than any his
organization has faced in its 80-year existence. He said it is a
constant struggle to adapt to meet the needs of children who are
facing new dangers every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that a child from a single-parent home was
considered a problem child. Now, with drugs, alcohol, school
shootings, having one parent is the least of their problems,'' said
Lowell. ``We had no concept of such issues 80 years ago. In 1919,
we had the Spanish flu virus threat that killed half a million
people. In 1999, we see a much more deadly viral threat: AIDS. The
difference in the problems we face now is astounding.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the priorities of the conference, he added, is to teach
members ways of helping mentors reach children before these
problems push them to the edge. ``Our goal is to continue to
develop educational strategies that teach mentors how to help
children cope with the environment around them, which is a
difficult thing to do because many of (the mentors) are struggling
to understand what's going on themselves,'' said Lowell. ``We try
to teach them how to deal with a child who is afraid to go to
school after a shooting, for example, to convince them to go even
if the mentor would not want to themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The task of training mentors, who generally range in age from
late 20s to early 30s, has become increasingly daunting for
Patricia Schwartz, a social worker who has been with Big Brothers
Big Sisters for 11 years. Each new threat to a child's welfare
alters the method in which mentors are taught to cope with such
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mentors undergo a rigorous screening process and extensive
training in which we teach them the psychology of children and the
changing family environment to prepare them for their jobs, but the
kinds of issues out there today make that process much more
complicated,'' she said. ``The problems are much more complex and
so you have to really train them to understand that things have
changed a lot since they were kids so they can relate to the kids
in ways that can really help them.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obstacles, Michael Goldman, 57, who has been a big
brother for six years, said he sees a link between the generations.
The Holliston father of two said the most important coping skill in
a mentor is the ability to love.
</P>
<P>
   ``A child in need is a child in need, whether he has a single
parent, a drug problem, or is caught in violence, doesn't matter. I
know the issues are worse than when I was raising my children but
they are not impossible,'' he said. ``All you do is spend time with
them, try to relate to them, and show them that you care about them
and you love them. You don't have to have all the answers,
sometimes just knowing someone loves them is enough to turn them
around.''

KANSAS VOTES TO DELETE EVOLUTION FROM STATE'S SCIENCE CURRICULUM 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ala., Tenn., Neb., N.M., Texas, Ohio, Wash., N.H., Calif.)  (nk) 
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Kansas Board of Education voted Wednesday to
delete virtually any mention of evolution from the state's science
curriculum, in one of the most far-reaching efforts by creationists
in recent years to challenge the teaching of evolution in schools.
</P>
<P>
   While the move does not prevent the teaching of evolution, it
will not be included in the state assessment tests that students
take, which may discourage teachers and students from spending time
on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   And the decision is likely to embolden local school boards
seeking to remove evolution from their curriculums, force teachers
to note questions about its validity, or introduce creationist
ideas. Some local school boards have already said they will
consider adopting creationist textbooks, even though others have
said they will continue teaching evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Creationists say a divine being created humans and other
species. They say that since evolution cannot be observed or
replicated in a laboratory, there is no evidence that it actually
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas is the latest state to face a battle over evolution and
creationism in recent years. Alabama, New Mexico and Nebraska have
made changes that, to varying degrees, challenge the preeminence of
evolution in the scientific curriculum. Others, like Texas, Ohio,
Washington, New Hampshire and Tennessee, have considered, but
ultimately defeated, similar bills, including some that would have
required those who teach evolution to also present evidence
contradicting it. At the local level, dozens of school boards are
trying to make similar changes.
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade after the Supreme Court concluded that states
could not compel the teaching of creationism, creationists appear
to be increasingly active, adopting a new strategy to get around
the constitutional issues. Instead of trying to push creationism
onto the curriculum, many creationists are trying to keep Darwin
out of the classroom or insure that if evolution is taught, it is
presented as merely one, unproven theory.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, for example, biology textbooks carry a sticker
calling evolution ``a controversial theory some scientists present
as a scientific explanation for the origin of living things.'' The
disclaimer adds: ``No one was present when life first appeared on
earth. Therefore, any statement about life's origins should be
considered as theory, not fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Moore, a biology professor at the University of Louisville
and editor of the magazine of the National Association of Biology
Teachers, said, ``It's going on everywhere, and the creationists
are winning.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the issue was so charged in some school districts that
some teachers simply choose not to teach evolution, rather than
risk an outcry from parents, churches or local school boards.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip E. Johnson, a law professor at the University of
California at Berkeley, who is affiliated with a creationist group
and has written books attacking ``misrepresentations'' and
``propaganda'' in the teaching of evolution, said defending
evolution was becoming ``the science educators' Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas decision is significant because the new curriculum
not only deletes most references to biological evolution, it also
deletes references to ideas like the big bang theory, which holds
that the universe was born from a vast explosion, and includes at
least one case study that creationists use to debunk evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of changes made, the thoroughness with which
references to evolution are deleted or definitions changed, it's
more extensive than what we've seen before,'' said Molleen
Matsumura, network project director of the National Center for
Science Education.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Looy, a spokesman for Answers in Genesis, a creationist
group planning a ``creation museum of natural history,'' said he
thought the Kansas vote was important because he believes
``students in public schools are being taught that evolution is a
fact, that they're just products of survival of the fittest,'' said
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not meaning in life if we're just animals in a
struggle for survival,'' Looy said. ``It creates a sense of
purposelessness and hopelessness, which I think leads to things
like pain, murder and suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Many creationists believe that the Bible shows life on earth
cannot be more than 10,000 years old. Some have adopted a less
religious interpretation, saying the earth was created by an
``intelligent designer'' because it is simply too complex to be
explained any other way.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution, considered by scientists to be the cornerstone of
biology, is the theory that, based on fossils, anatomy and genetic
evidence, life began on earth about 3.9 billion years ago and
humans and other species evolved from a common ancestor. Scientists
point out that much of science cannot be repeated in a laboratory
and yet no one doubts the existence of, say, atoms.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Recently, creationists have been searching for events they say
raise doubts about evolution or suggest the world is much younger
than scientists claim. One common example is the 1980 eruption of
Mount St. Helen's, which creationists say proves geologic changes
can happen very rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   The new Kansas science standards include Mount St. Helen's and
Mount Etna as examples that ``suggest alternative explanations to
scientific hypotheses or theories.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas debate began over a year ago when the state appointed
a committee of 27 scientists and professors to write a state
version of new national science guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   But when those standards were submitted to the board, a
conservative member, Steve Abrams, a veterinarian and former head
of the state Republican Party, said he ``had some serious questions
about it,'' claiming ``it is not good science to teach evolution as
fact.''
</P>
<P>
   With the help of members of a creationist group, Abrams rewrote
the standards, deleting most of the two pages on evolution, as well
as the big bang theory. What remained was ``micro-evolution,''
which refers to genetic adaptation and natural selection within a
species. But ``macro-evolution,'' the origin of species, was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams also attempted to insert these words: ``The design and
complexity of the design of the cosmos requires an intelligent
designer.''
</P>
<P>
   But after protest from scientists, that sentence was stricken in
the final version, which was approved by a vote of 6-4; the
standards are recommendations only, and it is still up to local
school boards in Kansas to decide what will actually be taught in
the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   But biologists, like Steve Case, who was on the original
standards committee, said that because ``evolution is such a
unifying principle of biology,'' the new standards could mean
students will be unprepared for college admission tests and college
science courses. Some teachers said they would continue to teach
evolution and resign if forced not to.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Wagnon, a board member who opposed the new standards, said
``the effort to emphasize the rock of ages more than the age of
rocks'' could make Kansas science students ``the laughing stock of
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   A watchdog group, Americans United for Separation of Church and
State, said it might sue if it decides the standards favor
creationism.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bill Graves, a Republican, also opposed the changes and
predicted that the legislature might try to make the board an
appointed, rather than an elected body.
</P>
<P>
   But the climate in Kansas and elsewhere may complicate things. A
nationwide Gallup poll found that about 45 percent of those asked
believed in creationism and another 40 percent believed evolution
was set in motion by a divine being. Polls of scientists have found
that about 40 percent share the latter view.
</P>
<P>
   The Topeka Capital-Journal recently editorialized that
``creationism is as good a hypothesis as any for how the universe
began.''
</P>
<P>
   And even some science teachers underscore the complexity. Lu
Bitter, who is co-chairwoman of the high school science department
in Pratt, Kan., said she strongly opposed the new standards and was
also fighting a proposal before her school board to adopt a
creationist textbook.
</P>
<P>
   But she said that the school's biology teachers have spent time
discussing creationism, as well as evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've covered all views, read Genesis in the classroom and we
use a video that shows three different views,'' Mrs. Bitter said.
</P>
<P>
   When students leave class, ``they know that there are different
ways of looking at the way life exists on earth,'' she said.

MICROSOFT AND MEDIA COMPANIES TO BACK WEB SERVICE FOR BLACKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SAUL HANSELL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A group of big media and technology companies has agreed to back
BET Holdings, which operates several black-oriented cable
television stations, in establishing an elaborate Internet service
aimed at African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   BET has raised $35 million for the project from Microsoft Corp.,
USA Networks, News Corp., and AT&AMP;T's Liberty Media unit, which is a
minority owner of BET. The service, which is known as BET.Com, is
scheduled to be introduced on Nov. 1 and will replace the company's
existing joint venture with Microsoft, MSBET.
</P>
<P>
   While the earlier site mainly focused on links to programming on
BET's Black Entertainment Television network, the new site will
have a broader range of offerings including news, electronic mail,
shopping and, most important, chat rooms and other features to
build a community within the site.
</P>
<P>
   So far, African-Americans have been less active on the Internet
than the population overall. Forrester Research estimates that 23
percent of the 12 million black households are online, compared to
34 percent of white households. But online usage by blacks is
increasing faster, Forrester notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, African-Americans have found the Internet hard to
use, expensive and at the end of the day they said ``there's
nothing here for me,'' said Robert L. Johnson, the chairman and
majority owner of BET. ``We're going to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the audience is poised to increase now that the
price of computers and Internet access has fallen sharply and in
some cases can be had for free.
</P>
<P>
   The company hopes to make money by selling advertising and by
selling merchandise including urban apparel, black oriented music
and collectable items.
</P>
<P>
   The BET venture will compete with several existing sites aimed
at African-Americans, all of which are backed by major media
companies. The largest is BlackVoices.Com, an offering of Tribune
Co., which claims to serve 500,000 users a month who look at a
total of 14 million pages. A close second is NetNoir.com, 20
percent owned by America Online. Cox Communications also operates
BlackFamilies.Com.
</P>
<P>
   E. David Ellington, the chairman of Net Noir, said he isn't
worried about the BET venture, despite the company's well known
name and the promotional power of its television network.
</P>

   ``This is a new medium and it needs new brands,'' he said.
``Name a big media company that has done well on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellington said Net Noir is raising $10 million to $15 million
from venture capital funds and is about to add new features to its
site.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Cooper, the president of Black Voices, said that Tribune
is considering selling a portion of Black Voices in order to raise
money to compete with BET.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it takes $35 million to stay at the top, we'll raise $35
million,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said Black Voices had found limited success trying to
sell advertising and merchandise online.
</P>
<P>
   ``African-Americans are new to the Internet, and to expect them
to give their credit cards online is a bit of a stretch,'' he said.
The company has found a profitable niche selling job listings from
large companies that want to attract a diverse work force. This
need works well with the largest group of African-Americans online:
Office workers who surf at their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, however, said that BET expects that its consumers will
ultimately shop online and that the service can help enable a new
group of black entrepreneurs who will find ways to sell their
products online.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is tremendous wealth being created in the Internet
economy that African-Americans should be a part of,'' he said.
``The Internet can give us the opportunity to control our own
destiny by cutting out the middle man.''

 &HT;    Lunch safety tips
 &HT;    By Jan Norris

<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Lunch boxes are perfect breeding grounds
for bacteria that can make your child sick. Avoid the germs by
using the following food safety practices from the USDA.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep the lunch box clean. If it's hard plastic, run it through
the dishwasher. Some soft vinyl ones can be put through the washing
machine on a slow cycle. Use a brush to clean thermos bottles.
Occasionally rinse both box and bottle with a solution of 1
tablespoon bleach to 1 gallon of water.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep foods from cross-contamination when you prepare the
lunch. If you're making a sandwich and cutting fresh fruits or
vegetables, wash the knife and cutting board in between.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use ice packs in all lunch boxes that have fresh fruits, dairy
or meat products. This includes cheese, yogurt, cut fruits,
pudding, deli meats, canned meats and tuna, soups and salads with
dressings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Teach your child to always wash his or her hands before and
after eating, and not to eat food that's been dropped on an
uncovered surface or the floor.
</P>
<P>
   _ Teach your child to avoid sharing foods, drinks or utensils
with others.

 &HT;    Treats for the lunchbox
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Not a lot is new for the lunch box set _
just different flavors or packaging of old favorites.
</P>
<P>
   _ Oscar Mayer has come out with waffles and pancake versions of
their Lunchables, but what kid wants cold waffles and cold
pancakes? They're packed with a ``bacon product'' that resembles
pepperoni rounds, a syrup container and Tang breakfast drink.
They're $2.29 each.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mott, Delmonte and Dole have introduced new flavors in their
popular individual fruit cup and applesauce lines: tropical fruits,
all pineapple, cran-raspberry and others appeal to kids. Delmonte's
four-pack of Fruitrageous individual servings is $1.99.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hostess mini-muffins are available in sealed bags of six:
They're $3.19 for a box of 24 muffins. These could be split among
several kids, and would give variety in the snack category.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bugs, Daffy and other friends appear on Carrots &AMP; Dip
packages, just right for lunchboxes, found in the produce
department. Cost is $2.19 for three pull-apart servings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jacobsen's makes cinnamon-raisin toast, similar to a biscotti,
that is appealing. (Look for it with melba toasts and crackers.) It
would make a crunchy ``sandwich'' spread with peanut butter or
cream cheese. It's $2.19 a package, and comes in blueberry and
raspberry flavors as well.

 &HT;    Variety makes the grade for healthy school meals.
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Agonizing over which lunch box will
thrill your child? Will it be Rugrats, Star Wars, a high-tech
Arctic Zone or maybe Blues Clues?
</P>
<P>
   Here's news: It won't matter, as long as a peanut butter and
jelly sandwich is inside.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mitch Head, spokesman for the Peanut Advisory Board
that tracks all things peanut-related, a PB&AMP;J is the No. 1 sandwich
requested by schoolkids who take their lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Some kids would eat it every day, much to their parents' dismay.
</P>
<P>
   But it really is OK, says Cindy Kepler, a Royal Palm Beach
dietitian who works with children's diets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's what they want, then let them have it and you can
work in the variety of foods for breakfast and dinner,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Variety is the key _ as with all diets, she said. She had a
laundry list of advice about packing children's lunches; she's done
it for more than 12 years as a mother of three.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as children are given choices, they will self-regulate
their caloric needs. They are learning an important thing, and it's
where we are with teaching nutrition: Letting our bodies be the
judge of what and how much to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Some lighter eaters may not need a whole sandwich, for instance,
but may be satisfied with half a sandwich, fewer carrot sticks or
one cookie. Others may need two sandwiches and two juices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask the child when she comes home from school _ don't depend
on the lunchbox, because older kids may throw away food rather than
bring it home. Ask them if they got enough to eat and if they felt
hungry afterward. They're blunt _ they'll tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   Or you can visit your child at lunchtime. Most public and
private schools allow parents in the lunchroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a good experience for me, to sit down with my
daughter and see what she chose to eat,'' Kepler said.
</P>
<P>
   It also provided a look at the lunchtime experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, they don't have as much time as you think they do,
and if you give them a lot of foods, they may not have time to get
to some of them.''
</P>
<P>
   She encourages combining several courses, such as the
banana-tortilla-peanut butter roll-up that Marci Green makes her
son, Grant.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's clever, and it covers several food groups,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kepler likes small snacks such as yogurt or pudding, especially
for kids who don't like milk. ``That's a way to get in the calcium
they need.''
</P>
<P>
   But she warned of hard-to-open packaging. ``You need to give
these packages to the child at home, to make sure they can open
them _ some of them are very difficult to open, and the child may
not have a teacher or adult to open them for them at school.''
</P>
<P>
   Snack foods such as nuts or cereals and even chips are fine, as
long as they are balanced with other foods in the lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the lunchbox is a great way to teach good food habits
that will last a lifetime, Kepler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Occasionally your child will say, `So-and-so gets cookies
every day in his lunch,''' Kepler said. ``You can turn that into a
learning tool. Instead of saying cookies are bad for you _ we never
want to say that any food is bad, just that there are healthier
choices _ you can ask the child what healthier choice they might
make.''
</P>
<P>
   That can open a door to talking about nutrition, and making
healthy choices when the child buys lunch at school.
</P>
<P>
   Stickers, tatoos or special pencils are ideal treats, she said.
Using food, especially sugary candy or fatty chips, as a reward
sets up bad habits later in life. Better to use objects, so
children aren't taught to look to food as comfort or reward later
in life when weight might become a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best role model is still what the parent is doing: They'll
put you in check real fast. The more they practice variety at an
early age, it'll stay with them the rest of their lives,'' Kepler
said.
</P>
<P>
   Here are Kepler's comments on some common school lunch choices:
</P>
<P>
   _ Deli meats: Choose low-fat and low-salt varieties, and wrap
them around cheese rather than putting them on a sandwich with
high-fat spreads.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vegetable sticks with dip: Choose lower-fat dips, or use plain
yogurt spiced with herbs and seasonings as a dressing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fruit: Fresh fruits are great in any form, but if kids don't
like them, serve them fruit juice. Cut fruit in small pieces for
younger children to prevent choking.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pizza: A good choice if it includes cheese and tomato sauce;
it covers three food groups (starch is in crust).
</P>
<P>
   _ Chips, pretzels, cookies and crackers: These foods should be
served sparingly, with choices from more nutrient-dense foods such
as fresh fruits. But don't use them as treats or withhold them as
``punishment.'' Food as a reward leads to bad dining habits later
in life.
</P>
<P>
   Reading, writing and a roll-up
</P>
<P>
   Packed by: Marci Green for son Grant, 5.
</P>
<P>
   What's in it? Peanut butter-banana roll-up in flour tortilla,
peanuts, grape tomatoes with blue cheese dressing, carton of
low-fat milk.
</P>
<P>
   What the dietitian says: Very creative, and includes all the
food groups. Great variety and good fiber.
</P>
<P>
   Pizza + cookies  &QC;  1 great lunch
</P>
<P>
   Packed by: Jessica Almeida, 9, as a ``fantasy'' lunch for
herself.
</P>
<P>
   What's in it? Pizza, chocolate chip cookies, fruit cup, ``ice
cream if I could pack it'' and fruit juice.
</P>
<P>
   What the dietitian says: Great variety, includes all food
groups, if you count the cheese on the pizza for protein, and ice
cream for milk. Somewhat high fat content, however.
</P>
<P>
   Honor-roll meal
</P>
<P>
   Packed by: Ann Almeida for daughter Jessica, 9
</P>
<P>
   What's in it? Tuna sub with lettuce and mayo, yogurt, fruit
roll-up, grapes. Box of cereal is morning snack.
</P>
<P>
   What the dietitian says: Good variety. All four food groups
represented.
</P>
<P>
   A class wrap
</P>
<P>
   Packed by: Dietitian Cindy Kepler, for any of her three kids
(14, 12 and 8)
</P>
<P>
   What's in it? Turkey slices wrapped around cheese, pretzels,
graham cracker cookies, pudding snack, fruit juice.
</P>
<P>
   What the dietitian says: Carrot sticks should be included; this
way, all the food groups are covered.

HARVARD NAMES PRIEST TO `CHAIR' DIVINITY SCHOOL BOARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMES BANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- With a presidential flourish, Harvard University
Wednesday named the Rev. J. Bryan Hehir, a Roman Catholic priest,
as the new leader of its divinity school.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't call him a dean.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, call him the ``chair of the Executive Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   At a school where titles are considered very important, Harvard
officials scrambled to explain why Hehir, a world-class theologian,
would not be officially called a dean. Because of his duties as a
priest and his role as a counselor with Catholic Relief Services,
Hehir, they said, would run the school with other members of the
Executive Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, his first responsibilities are to his faith and
church,'' said Joe Wrinn, a university spokesman. ``We wanted to
adjust the job to take advantage of his talents. We get to take
advantage of his talents, and he is able to keep his commitments to
his parish. This is a good match between Harvard and Brian.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his official title, Hehir, a renowned theologian who
specializes in Roman Catholic social teaching, has been serving as
the de-facto acting dean of the school since November, after Ronald
Thiemann resigned the deanship following the discovery of
pornography on his Harvard-owned computer.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues praised Hehir's leadership in a time when the school
was reeling from the scandal. Harvard president Neil Rudenstine
asked Thiemann to step down last fall after staff found thousands
of pornographic images on his office computer. Staff, faculty and
students were stunned by the revelations, made public in May, which
had been a closely guarded secret at the university.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we needed was a sense of openness, and (Hehir) provided
that in spades,'' said Professor David Hall, who served on the
advisory committee that recommended Hehir.
</P>
<P>
   Hehir, 58, is a graduate of the divinity school and the first
Catholic to assume permanent leadership of the school. The Rev.
George W. MacRae, a Jesuit priest, served as interim dean for
several months, but died suddenly of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   During his career, Hehir has received a plateful of academic
honors. He received a MacArthur ``genius'' grant and honorary
degrees from 25 colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   He has been a forceful voice in the Catholic Church on issues
involving peace and warfare, and he played an instrumental role in
the drafting of the 1983 Catholic Bishop's Statement on Nuclear
Weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of Hehir's appointment was not unexpected,
though the linguistic gymnastics surrounding his official title
baffled some faculty members.
</P>
<P>
   When told about the confusion over his title, Hehir laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvard's ways are baffling to many,'' he said. ``Harvard does
not spend time making questions simple.''

TERM LIMITS GROUP LAUNCHES ANTI-MEEHAN EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three months after Representative Martin T. Meehan
of Massachusetts announced he would break his term-limits pledge,
an advocacy group launched a television ad campaign Wednesday
urging voters to ``tell Marty Meehan to keep his word.''
</P>
<P>
   US Term Limits Foundation, a nonprofit group based in
Washington, so far has focused on Representative George Nethercutt,
the Washington state Republican who is running for reelection
despite a pledge in 1994 not to seek another term in 2000. The
group had also urged eight other Republicans to keep similar
promises, six of whom complied.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan _ the sole House Democrat who pledged not to run again in
2000 _ became the group's second target in television ads. Like
Nethercutt, who ousted House Speaker Tom Foley on a platform of
term limits, Meehan ``used it as a prominent campaign issue,''
repeatedly promising during his 1992 campaign not to run for more
than four terms, said the organization's spokesman, Jason Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Bill McCann, Meehan's chief of staff, said, ``Three months ago,
Marty explained his decision to run for reelection to his
constituents, and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. I
can't believe his constituents are going to be swayed by a
30-second attack ad funded by a special interest group with no ties
to Massachusetts or the 5th District.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller refused to say how much money the organization planned to
spend targeting Meehan in Massachusetts, and he denied reports that
$1 million was being spent on Nethercutt in Washington. A
congressional aide familiar with the advertising campaigns said the
Meehan effort would cost about $14,000.
</P>
<P>
   US Term Limits raised more than $2.5 million in tax-exempt
donations in 1996, according to its latest public filing with the
Internal Revenue Service. But the organization refuses to identify
its supporters, billing itself as a nonpartisan advocacy group
designed to ``provide leadership to organize the legislation of
term limits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows where they get their money,'' said Ken Lisaius, a
spokesman for Nethercutt.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan has raised more than $300,000 this year and is not
expected to face a serious contender in 2000. It is unclear what
effect US Term Limits hopes the ads will have.
</P>
<P>
   The ad combines Meehan's past comments supporting term limits
with snide voice-over remarks. In response to a statement by Meehan
that there are ``too many career politicians in Washington,'' the
commentator says, ``He's got a good point.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ad makes no mention of what could be Meehan's most
sensitive issue: his refusal to rule out a run for governor in
2002.

REPORT SEES GAY RIGHTS PROGRESS IN ORGANIZED RELIGION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Rev. Jimmy Creech, Sister Jeannine Gramick, and
the Rev. Robert Nugent have all gotten into trouble for what they
believed, deep in their souls, was their Christian duty:
ministering to lesbians and gays.
</P>
<P>
   Creech was put on trial last year by the United Methodist Church
for blessing a union between two lesbians. ``This is not a
dispassionate, academic debate we are having in our churches,''
Creech said Wednesday. ``And the more the churches react with
legalisms and vindictiveness, the more it is causing people to
recognize the injustices.''
</P>
<P>
   Creech was in Washington, along with other gay and heterosexual
church activists, to promote what the Human Rights Campaign, a gay
advocacy group, said was the first positive report on how
mainstream US religions are grappling with homosexuality in their
congregations and their clergy.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``Mixed Blessings: Mainstream Religion and Gay and
Lesbian Americans,'' the report says that even as American clergy
come under increasing fire for ministering to homosexual members
and blessing gay marriages, and mainstream churches get torn apart
over the issue of gays in the pulpit, the public tumult over gay
rights in organized religion is a sign of progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never before have we seen such a tug of war in the nation's
mainstream religions, and that is good news,'' said Elizabeth
Birch, the campaign's executive director. ``Many of the largest
denominations are wrestling with not just the issue of gay and
lesbian worship, but the very, very charged issue of gay
marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Creech, who lost his pulpit in Omaha after his acquittal, faces
another trial this fall _ and possible penalties ranging from a
reprimand to explusion _ for officiating over the vows of two men
in Chapel Hill, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pastoral act, but I understood it was also a very
political act,'' said Creech, adding that he intends to keep
challenging the ``institutional bigotry'' of the Methodist Church
in opposing gay unions.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Vatican ordered Nugent and Gramick to give up
the 20-year-old New Ways Ministry they had run in Mount Rainier,
Md., for gays and their families because a long church
investigation found the pair were not following the Roman Catholic
doctrine on ``the intrinsic evil of homosexual acts and the
objective disorder of homosexual inclination.''
</P>
<P>
   Nugent, 62, was invited to take part in Wednesday's panel but
did not attend. He has given up his mission in order to remain a
priest. Garmick, 57, has been in seclusion since she was banned
from ministering to gays and has not indicated whether she will
stay in her order, the School Sisters of Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Bennett, author of the Mixed Blessing report, said the
Vatican's high-profile disciplining of Nugent and Gramick was an
example of a current trend within some church leaderships to
``retrench'' and get tough in the face of growing debate and even
acceptance of gay rights within religious congregations.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many observers believe the Vatican was sending a warning
signal to the US Catholic bishops not to become too progressive on
the gay issue. In a 1997 paper, the bishops told parents they
should not only love their gay children, but also refrain from
condemning or intervening in their sexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The report, based on 1998 data from 10 different denominations,
shows that the churches' attitudes toward homosexuality are as
diverse as the religions themselves. The conservative Southern
Baptist Convention not only considers homosexuality a biblical sin,
but it also has voted to exclude gays and lesbians from its
definition of family and has lobbied against Clinton administration
initiatives to end discriminiation against gays. The Mormon Church,
which can excommunicate gays, spent $1 million last year on
political campaigns in Alaska and Hawaii to bar same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   The Presbyterian Church is deeply divided over its ban on
ordaining noncelibate gay ministers. The Evangelical Lutheran
Church in America does not approve of clergy blessing gay unions,
but it doesn't have a policy for disciplining them. The United
Methodist Church welcomes gays as members but condemns their sexual
activity.
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox Judaism does not recognize a gay or lesbian
orientation, while Reform Judaism ordains gay and lesbian rabbis,
supports the rights of gays to marry, and permits rabbis to bless
gay and lesbian couples. The Unitarian Universalist Association
also ordains gay clergy, allows homosexuals to serve in church
leadership positions, and blesses gay unions.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Meg Riley, director of the Unitarians' Washington
office, said her church is growing because gays, like
heterosexuals, come from religious traditions and want to be part
of faith communities. ``Some religions believe it's a sin to be
gay,'' Riley said. ``We say it's a sin to be homophobic.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Horn, president of Straight from the Heart, a non-profit
group in Des Moines, said, ``If you disagree with the part of the
church that is extremely liberal and not Bible-believing, then you
are called homophobic and a bigot.'' Horn's group opposes gay
rights and is trying to get the presidential candidates to sign a
``traditional family pledge'' against gay marriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gays may be making inroads with the liberal churches,''
Horn added, ``but I haven't seen the Presbyterians or the
Methodists giving into this idea that marriage between anyone but a
man and woman isn't a sin.''

COURT EXPANDS RIGHTS OF CONVICTED SEX-OFFENDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In yet another blow to the state's controversial sex
offender registry law, the Supreme Judicial Court has ruled that
anyone convicted of a sex crime is entitled to a hearing before
being listed on the registry.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's decision, which came in a case involving a
15-year-old boy accused of raping a 4-year-old girl, further
expands the rights of those targeted for inclusion on the registry,
which allows public access to information kept by police about
convicted sex offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the court is saying is that you can't treat all sex
offenders the same,'' said attorney Larni Levy of the Committee for
Public Counsel Services, which filed a brief supporting the right
to a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fantasy about putting all sex offenders in the same
category is just that _ a fantasy _ and it shouldn't be done.''
</P>
<P>
   The SJC's decision, the latest in a series of rulings
challenging the 1996 sex offender registry law, comes as the
Legislature is revamping it amid widespread legal challenges and
concerns that the due-process rights of offenders were being
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision last summer, the high court ruled that sex
offenders are entitled to a hearing before their degree of
dangerousness is determined. The prior November, the court ruled
that offenders classified as the lowest risk to repeat their crimes
must be granted a hearing so they can argue against their inclusion
on the registry.
</P>
<P>
   This latest decision means that no one can be included on the
registry until they are given a hearing before the Sex Offender
Registry Board, the five-member, part-time panel that evaluates
convicted sex offenders.
</P>
<P>
   In a 20-page opinion written by Justice Margaret Marshall, the
court also ruled that if the state does not want to hold hearings
for offenders it considers the most dangerous _ such as those
convicted of repeated crimes of violence against young children _
then it should issue ``narrowly tailored'' regulations defining
which crimes would result in automatic registration without a
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The burden will be on the sex offender board to establish at
the hearing that the offender poses a risk to vulnerable
populations,'' the court said.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials were dismayed by the high court's
ruling, which they said would weaken a law designed to protect
children from dangerous sexual predators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed that the court has extended this ruling to
all sex offenders and made it that much more difficult to get
parents the information they need to protect their kids,'' said
Assistant Attorney General Peter Sacks, who said his office would
``work closely with the Legislature to enact a new set of
regulations that makes this information readily available to the
public.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials also expressed concern that Wednesday's decision
would further burden the registry board, which is responsible for
registering the roughly 15,000 people convicted of sex crimes since
1981.
</P>
<P>
   But Boston attorney James M. Doyle, who represented the unnamed
plaintiff in the case that prompted Wednesday's ruling, called the
court's decision ``not only good constitutional law, but good
public policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle noted, for example, that a ``child rape'' conviction
encompasses a broad range of activity, including consensual sex
between underage teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   In such cases, Marshall wrote, ``the State's interest in
protecting children from recidivist sex offenders might not be
sufficiently urgent to warrant subjecting to registration every
person convicted of those acts.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's ruling, said Levy, affirms ``what we've been trying
to impress upon the courts all along, which is that each offender
must be treated as an individual and can't be lumped together in an
anonymous category.''
</P>
<P>
   The sex offender registry law became effective on Oct. 1, 1996.
Under the law, anyone convicted since 1981 of one or more sex
crimes on a list of 11 offenses must register with their local
police or face prosecution. The state is required to categorize
each offender in one of three levels, based on the likelihood that
he or she will commit another sex crime.
</P>
<P>
   The law was patterned after New Jersey's ``Megan's Law,'' named
for 7-year-old Megan Kanka who was raped and murdered in 1994 by a
paroled, repeat sex offender living in her neighborhood.

MARKET PLACE: RULING COULD BRING FLURRY OF FUTURES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (mk) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal appeals court decision issued this week could lead to
a flurry of new futures contracts based on stock indexes of
specific industries, perhaps opening the door for a technology or
even an Internet futures contract.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, based in Chicago, unanimously ruled that the Securities
and Exchange Commission had wrongly denied an application last year
by the Chicago Board of Trade to offer futures contracts based on
the Dow Jones transportation and utility averages.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC had approved the Chicago board's application to trade a
futures contract based on the Dow Jones industrial average. But it
had rejected requests for contracts based on the transportation and
utility averages by arguing that those averages were too narrow and
possibly subject to manipulation and did not accurately reflect the
industry segments.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision leaves approval of the proposed contracts
up to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which filed a brief
in the case supporting part of the Chicago Board of Trade's
position.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding the number and type of futures contracts it offers
could give the Chicago Board of Trade, the world's largest
financial futures and options exchange, an important boost at a
crucial time. Like many exchanges where trading is conducted on a
central floor, rather than over computer networks, the board of
trade has been wrestling with how to compete with cheaper, more
efficient rivals that have taken advantage of technology to build
global financial networks.
</P>
<P>
   Futures contracts, which are agreements to buy or sell a
particular commodity at a fixed date in the future, are used by
investors to hedge portfolios or to cheaply and quickly gain
exposure to a commodity or market segment.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a futures contract based on a broad stock-market
average, like the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, can be used by an
investor to bet on the direction of the overall stock market at a
fraction of the cost of buying each of the 500 stocks in the index.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling, the appeals court rejected the SEC's arguments
that the indexes were not ``broad-based'' enough to satisfy
securities laws. Specifically, an index that is the subject of a
futures contract must reflect ``the market for all publicly traded
equity or debt securities or a substantial segment thereof,'' or
must be comparable to such a measure.
</P>
<P>
   The court decided that the law, as written, included indexes of
single industries, and it noted that the long-term correlation of
each of the Dow Jones averages and the industries they track
exceeded 92 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the court rejected the SEC's arguments that futures
contracts based on such narrow market measures could be used to
manipulate securities prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone were determined to drive the price of
transportation stocks up or down, buying and selling thousands of
futures contracts on the Chicago Board of Trade would be like
pouring a Dixie cup of water into Lake Michigan: There would be an
effect, but it would not be detectable,'' Judge Frank Easterbrook
wrote in the court's opinion.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the SEC said the commission ``is reviewing the
decision and considering our alternatives,'' which include the
possibility of an appeal to the Supreme Court. A spokesman for the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission declined to comment on whether
the commission would approve the new contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Donovan, president and chief executive of the Chicago
Board of Trade, said that he expected approval relatively soon and
that the exchange would be ready to trade the contracts. The
exchange will consider other industry contracts as well, he said,
while declining to elaborate. But it is not far-fetched to imagine
an Internet or other technology-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see futures contracts being created based on value or
growth styles, or springing up along all kinds of industries,''
said Michael Brennan, a professor of finance at the Anderson School
at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Some stock indexes might be too narrow or untested to fit the
statutory requirements for a futures contract. But the appeals
court specifically cited the age and history of the Dow Jones
transportation and utility averages as lending weight to the
position of the board of trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones transportation average was started in 1884 by
Charles Dow, a founder of Dow Jones &AMP; Co., to track nine railroads,
a steamship company and Western Union. Now consisting of 20 stocks,
it is the oldest U.S. stock index, 12 years older than its
better-known sister, the Dow Jones industrial average. The utility
average was started in 1929 with 20 stocks and now has 15.
</P>
<P>
   Since Dow Jones decided in 1997 to license its indexes for use
in financial products like futures and options, the amount of money
tracking those indexes _ and the fees that Dow Jones earns _ have
grown sharply. At the end of June, $58 billion in assets were
invested in financial products linked to the Dow Jones averages, up
from $13.6 billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Specialized futures contracts would be of great value to mutual
fund managers and other investment professionals, Brennan said. ``A
mutual fund manager who has to manage cash flows in and out of a
fund often holds cash in the bank,'' he said. ``But that means that
he is under-invested, causing his performance to lag. A futures
contract is a way to allow a manager to be fully invested at all
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, an investment manager can bet on a specific industry
using options on stock indexes, which are contracts that convey the
right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specific security
or basket of securities at a set price by a certain date.
</P>
<P>
   But such bets are more complicated using options than futures.
Options contracts are written at specific prices, and therefore can
expire worthless if the security's price does not move beyond the
contract price. Futures contracts, by contrast, are open-ended bets
on the market moving in a certain direction over a certain period
of time.
</P>
<P>
   And because for any given stock or index many options with
different exercise prices exist simultaneously, the volume of
trading in each is relatively small. Trading in futures contracts,
however, is usually concentrated in the contract that will expire
the soonest.
</P>
<P>
   Statutes currently outlaw futures contracts based on single
stocks, but such contracts on U.S. stocks are available in some
overseas markets. Donovan of the Chicago Board of Trade said he
hoped that the court's decision would eventually open the door for
single-stock futures contracts here.

TERM LIMITS GROUP LAUNCHES ANTI-MEEHAN EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three months after Representative Martin T. Meehan
of Massachusetts announced he would break his term-limits pledge,
an advocacy group launched a television ad campaign Wednesday
urging voters to ``tell Marty Meehan to keep his word.''
</P>
<P>
   US Term Limits Foundation, a nonprofit group based in
Washington, so far has focused on Representative George Nethercutt,
the Washington state Republican who is running for reelection
despite a pledge in 1994 not to seek another term in 2000. The
group had also urged eight other Republicans to keep similar
promises, six of whom complied.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan _ the sole House Democrat who pledged not to run again in
2000 _ became the group's second target in television ads. Like
Nethercutt, who ousted House Speaker Tom Foley on a platform of
term limits, Meehan ``used it as a prominent campaign issue,''
repeatedly promising during his 1992 campaign not to run for more
than four terms, said the organization's spokesman, Jason Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Bill McCann, Meehan's chief of staff, said, ``Three months ago,
Marty explained his decision to run for reelection to his
constituents, and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. I
can't believe his constituents are going to be swayed by a
30-second attack ad funded by a special interest group with no ties
to Massachusetts or the 5th District.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller refused to say how much money the organization planned to
spend targeting Meehan in Massachusetts, and he denied reports that
$1 million was being spent on Nethercutt in Washington. A
congressional aide familiar with the advertising campaigns said the
Meehan effort would cost about $14,000.
</P>
<P>
   US Term Limits raised more than $2.5 million in tax-exempt
donations in 1996, according to its latest public filing with the
Internal Revenue Service. But the organization refuses to identify
its supporters, billing itself as a nonpartisan advocacy group
designed to ``provide leadership to organize the legislation of
term limits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows where they get their money,'' said Ken Lisaius, a
spokesman for Nethercutt.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan has raised more than $300,000 this year and is not
expected to face a serious contender in 2000. It is unclear what
effect US Term Limits hopes the ads will have.
</P>
<P>
   The ad combines Meehan's past comments supporting term limits
with snide voice-over remarks. In response to a statement by Meehan
that there are ``too many career politicians in Washington,'' the
commentator says, ``He's got a good point.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ad makes no mention of what could be Meehan's most
sensitive issue: his refusal to rule out a run for governor in
2002.

 &HT;    Bayern seeking redemption
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Still stung by a stunning collapse in the European Cup
finals, Bayern Munich turns to the start of the German season this
weekend with a much stronger pack of rivals chasing it for domestic
supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   The Bavarians retain most of their star-studded roster that
slipped in the waning moments against Manchester United in May, and
they might well have enough to add to their record of 14 Bundesliga
championships. But they have some question marks.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Lothar Matthaus, the Bundesliga player of the year at
the age of 38, will be leaving in February for the MetroStars of
Major League Soccer. Goalkeeper Oliver Kahn returns, and Steffen
Effenberg leads an excellent midfield, buoyed by Brazilian veteran
Paulo Sergio, who comes from AS Roma. Defensively, the back line of
Matthaus, Bixente Lizarazu, Sami Kuffour and Jens Jeremies might be
the best in Europe. The strike force of Carsten Jancker and
Giovanne Elber will be accompanied by precocious 17-year-old
Paraguayan striker Roque Santa Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are stronger than last season because we have found the
right balance and have promising newcomers,'' Bayern manager Ottmar
Hitzfeld said this week.
</P>
<P>
   A tight German race down the stretch, with five teams
contending, could be just the boost German soccer needs to liven up
a league that in the era of free agency that began in the mid-'90s
has fallen further behind England, Italy and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Borussia Dortmund's offseason moves might make it the biggest
threat to Bayern, which won the Bundesliga by a whopping 15 points.
The addition of strikers Victor Ikpeba from AS Monaco and Fredi
Bobic from Stuttgart, plus defender Christian Worns from Paris
St-Germain, totaled nearly $19.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Hertha Berlin, which historically has languished in the lower
divisions, was energized by a third-place finish. Michael Preetz,
one of the few bright lights for Germany's collapsing national
team, will get help from Iranian star Ali Daei, late of Bayern
Munich, and ex-Hansa Rostock midfielder Marko Rehmer. American
midfielder Tony Sanneh got some playing time after arriving from
D.C. United late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Runner-up Bayer Leverkusen has never had a better shot at
winning its first title. Ex-Hansa forward Oliver Neuville will pair
with explosive Ulf Kirsten. American Frankie Hejduk is trying to
break into a creative midfield that includes Brazilians Emerson and
Ze Roberto.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiserslautern gets back veteran striker Olaf Marschall, who
went down late with a knee injury. French World Cup midfielder
Youri Djorkaeff, eased out at Inter Milan, has signed on.
</P>
<P>
   _ Just middling around: Schalke, Hamburg, Wolfsburg, Duisburg
and 1860 Munich all could fight for UEFA Cup spots. Stuttgart and
Eintracht Frankfurt will continue to struggle, and Werder Bremen
isn't going anywhere, even though it upset Bayern Munich in the
German Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   _ Relegation zone: Arminia Bielefeld, SSV Ulm and SpVgg
Unterhaching all earned promotion, but they probably will go right
back down. They have small payrolls and no stature to compete with
the big boys. Hansa Rostock and Freiburg also are endangered.
</P>
<P>
   _ TV talk: The only way to see German action is with a satellite
dish, and the news just got better for English-language viewers.
Fox Sports World, which shows a lot of live Bundesliga matches, as
well as the English Premier League, and numerous replays during the
week, will be available on DirecTV starting Sept. 1. Fox Sports
World Espanol will offer near-identical coverage in Spanish and can
be seen on the DISH Network.
</P>
<P>
   England: Own goals galore
</P>
<P>
   The start of the Premier League season got off to a strange
start last weekend, as three matches were decided by own goals. The
most dramatic was when Manchester United Jaap Stam headed a ball
into his own net in the 87th minute and lowly Everton got a 1-1
draw against the defending champions. Arsenal didn't look sharp in
its debut but won 2-1 in the fourth minute of injury time when
Leicester City's Frank Sinclair accidentally directed a clearance
past his keeper. Newly promoted Watford dropped a 3-2 decision to
10-man Wimbledon in similar fashion.... New Liverpool midfielder
Dietmar Hamann is out three months after breaking an ankle in a 2-1
season-opening win over Sheffield.... Bradford City, playing its
first top-flight match in 77 years, upset Middlesbrough 1-0....
Gustavo Poyet scored twice as Chelsea began its lofty title aims
with a 4-0 thrashing of Sunderland.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico loses star player
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican winter (Invierno) campaign kicks off Saturday with
Toluca, winner of the summer (Verano) championship in June, favored
to capture the ``double'' for 1999. Soccer in Mexico is flying high
after the Tricolores upset Brazil last week for the Confederations
Cup crown. But a rising star has made a rare Mexican move to
Europe. Defender Rafael Marquez, who helped Atlas reach the Verano
finals, signed with AS Monaco for a Mexican transfer record of $6
million.
</P>
<P>
   Free kicks
</P>
<P>
   Look for Brazilian striker Rivaldo to take advantage of
speculation that Manchester United has offered $50 million for his
services. Rivaldo has said he has no plans to leave Barcelona, but
the Spanish champions will have to up the ante substantially when
his contract expires after the coming season.... CNN/SI and World
Soccer magazine have teamed up to start a weekly top 10
international club team poll. Manchester United leads the first
list, ahead of Palmeiras of Brazil, which recently won the Copa
Libertadores. Results are posted each Monday (www.cnnsi.com). ...
Representatives from the five nations bidding for the 2006 World
Cup _ England, Germany, Brazil, South Africa and Morocco _ are
making their formal presentations to the FIFA board this week in
Zurich. A decision won't be made until
</P>
<P>
   next year.

KISS OFF THIS ROCK FILM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1996, a friend of mine flew from El Paso to Dallas to catch
Kiss in concert at Reunion Arena, where male thirtysomethings in
full Kiss makeup and regalia rocked and rolled all night (and
probably discussed stock options all day). This friend then saw
Kiss again when the group played El Paso later on the tour, even
though it was the same concert.
</P>
<P>
   Given this kind of behavior, the premise of ``Detroit Rock
City'' _ that four teen-age bozos from Cleveland, circa 1978, would
do anything for tickets to a Kiss concert in the group's hometown
of Detroit _ doesn't seem that far-fetched. It doesn't seem that
original, either; ``Forrest Gump'' director Robert Zemeckis' film
debut, 1978's ``I Wanna Hold Your Hand,'' was about teen-agers
trying to see the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan Show, and it seems
like every other sitcom since 1980 has featured a sweeps-stunt
episode in which a character is dying to see a cameo-friendly
musician.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit Rock City'' isn't just an expanded version of one of
those sitcoms; it's an expanded version with more nudity, substance
abuse, anti-religious content, vomit and strong language than
network TV can get away with. It would be easier to put up with all
that were it not for the annoying direction by Adam Rifkin (writer
of the similarly manic ``Mouse Hunt'' and ``Small Soldiers''), who
plays with his camera and editing equipment like a 12-year-old boy
hopped up on too much Surge.
</P>
<P>
   Rifkin's direction is the equivalent of all the pyrotechnics,
blood-spitting and tongue-flicking that goes on at a Kiss concert:
Although the music and the movie are fun to a point, the flashiness
helps obscure that this is much ado about very little. The four
Kiss fans are so enamored of the group that they've formed a
garage-rock cover band called Mystery that borrows from the Kiss
logo. Lex (Giuseppe Andrews) isn't much of a character, but
screenwriter Carl V. Dupre needed four kids because Kiss is a
quartet; Hawk (Edward Furlong) is the garage band's shy,
stage-fright-afflicted lead singer; Trip (James De Bello) is the
group's biggest stoner; and Jam (Sam Huntington) is its sensitive
soul. He's also the closest thing the movie has to a lead
character, since much of the action revolves around his
fundamentalist-Catholic mother's attempts to keep him from
experiencing that devil music.
</P>
<P>
   The mother (Lin Shaye, the overtanned neighbor in ``There's
Something About Mary'') is central to one of the film's problems:
It portrays all the adults as narrow-minded nuts.
Anti-authoritarianism has its place, but it helps if you're
revolting against something more substantive than buffoonish
caricatures.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Kiss' rebelliousness has always had a fraudulent air,
considering that the band is actually a master of good ol' American
capitalism. It's no coincidence that Kiss bassist Gene Simmons
acted as a producer on ``Detroit Rock City,'' which includes so
many constant reminders of Kiss merchandising that, in spirit, it's
not much more than a Kiss infomercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit Rock City'' has enough amusing moments to save it from
total disaster, and its set design and '70s trash-rock soundtrack
are so well-thought-out that it's too bad the production designer
or soundtrack coordinator didn't direct the movie. But the saddest
thing about the ``DRC'' is that it doesn't feel like it's nostalgic
so much as feels like it's 20 years too late, especially since Kiss
is still active _ at least the Beatles had stopped recording by the
time Zemeckis did ``I Wanna Hold Your Hand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit Rock City'' is rated R for sexual situations, nudity,
strong language, mild violence and drug humor.

 &HT;    Georgia wants rematch with champion Vols
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mississippi State still has Georgia on its mind.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Dome, to be specific.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs played Tennessee there in the SEC Championship Game
in December and led the eventual national champion well into the
fourth quarter before losing 24-14. That experience left an
indelible mark on State's psyche and has the coaches and players
salivating for a return trip to the title game this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had an opportunity to play and coach in a lot of big
games,'' coach Jackie Sherrill said, ``but that game was as
electrifying a game as I've ever been involved in.''
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore quarterback Wayne Madkin said, ``Seeing all that puts
something in your soul and makes you want to get back there. After
I left that field, I thought to myself, `I'm getting back here.'''
</P>
<P>
   This season, it would be an impressive achievement for the
Bulldogs. They lost 13 starters from last year's team, which
finished 8-5 and tied Arkansas for the Western Division crown. The
Bulldogs played in the SEC Championship Game because they beat the
Razorbacks in the regular season 22-21on a field goal with seven
seconds to play in their 10th game.
</P>
<P>
   The key to State's success, as always, will be its defense.
Defensive coordinator Joe Lee Dunn welcomes back seven starters
from a unit that limited six opponents to two touchdowns or fewer
last season. Leading the way are three seniors: tackle Kevin
Sluder, linebacker Barrin Simpson and cornerback Robert Bean.
</P>
<P>
   On offense, among the missing are nine starters, including
leading rusher and go-to guy James Johnson. Johnson led the SEC and
established school records for yards (1,383) and carries (236) in a
season, and had three games of more than 190 yards last season,
including a season high of 237 against Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson accounted for a large portion of State's offensive
production. But the Bulldogs think they can overcome his loss for
three reasons: the maturation of Madkin, the hiring of Sparky Woods
as offensive coordinator and the addition of freshman Dontae
Walker.
</P>
<P>
   As a redshirt freshman last year, Madkin was the starter by the
fourth game. The native of Huntsville, Ala., completed 96 of 199
passes for 1,532 yards, 11 touchdowns and nine interceptions. He
was at the controls in the victory over Arkansas and for critical
victories against Alabama and Mississippi in the last three games.
</P>
<P>
   The experience has Madkin ready to assume a leadership role.
</P>
<P>
   ``James Johnson was the cowbell last year; I'm the cowbell this
year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, a former head coach at South Carolina, joins State's
staff after serving as Virginia's offensive coordinator the past
two years. He is expected to have the Bulldogs running a more wide
open and varied offense geared toward getting more out of Madkin's
athleticism.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Chris Rainey is the incumbent starter at tailback. But he
had only 411 yards rushing the past three years behind Johnson and
Keefer McGee. Look for the Bulldogs to give Walker, a 6-foot,
212-pound prep All-American, an early shot.

 &HT;    Iowa extravaganza has harmless roots
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ As it was conceived just a few election
cycles ago, the modern-day political straw poll was a harmless
enough idea.
</P>
<P>
   State political parties are always trying to raise money, and
the competition among presidential candidates to make an early
showing was growing increasingly intense. Straw polls _ rough,
early head counts to measure support among the party faithful _
were a facet of political gatherings already.
</P>
<P>
   So, the thinking went, why not get the campaigns involved in
drumming up interest and charge a few bucks at the door for those
who want to show their colors at the state convention?
</P>
<P>
   From that bake sale germ of an idea has grown the elephantine
extravaganza to be played out this weekend in Ames, the college
town a few miles north of here.
</P>
<P>
   National media interest in Saturday's Iowa Republican straw poll
is so keen, there is scarcely a rental car to be found in the area
and precious few hotel rooms. The Chamber of Commerce estimates the
event will pump $3 million into Ames' economy _ and the impact is
far wider than that. Commercial telemarketing operations as far
away as Atlanta and Provo, Utah, reportedly have been employed to
phone prospective straw voters.
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Alexander's supporters will be treated to a dinner with
country singer Crystal Gayle, Miss Iowa, the governors of Tennessee
and Arkansas and former movie star Sen. Fred Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just the low-budget campaign. The Steve Forbes
campaign will be giving gold lapel pins to those who bring enough
supporters with them. There are rumors Margaret Thatcher may show
up for Forbes, and Arnold Schwarzenegger for George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa State Fair, which is going on just down the road, will
have a lot of competition. But is this any way to pick which
candidates get a chance to compete for the nomination and which
fall by the wayside?
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, you wait for a race to start before declaring a
winner,'' Alexander complained last week. To be sure, if he pulls a
surprise Saturday, Alexander will be touting the straw poll's
validity. But he has a point. It doesn't seem right that a
campaign's survival should depend on the outcome of an event held
this early, and under circumstances in which money can talk even
more directly than it will when the real voting starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa caucuses have been criticized for giving such a large
share of decision-making power to such a small fraction of voters.
But at least the caucus voters are hard-core party activists who
trudge to their neighbors' houses or the local elementary school on
a cold Iowa night. They are motivated primarily by loyalty to their
candidates and a sense of pride in jump-starting the democratic
process in sub-zero weather.
</P>
<P>
   The straw poll participants _ who by some estimates will number
around 12,000 _ represent only a small slice of the caucus turnout.
And even if they don't sell their votes outright _ of course there
have already been accusations along these lines _ chances are
pretty good a lot of them will be there primarily to see the show.
</P>
<P>
   We'll see if they get their money's worth.

ECONOMIC SCENE: COST OF LIFE ISSUE IN GM SUIT WAS LOST ON PRICE OF
A PART 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We're just like numbers,'' one juror said last month after
voting to order General Motors Corp. to pay $4.9 billion to six
people severely burned when the fuel tank of their 1979 Chevrolet
Malibu exploded after a drunken driver ran into them. The award is
an understandably human reaction to evidence introduced during the
trial that purported to show that GM had a policy of foregoing
safety features that cost shockingly little, perhaps no more than
$2.40 a car.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the award is outrageously high, and will probably be set
aside, or at least greatly reduced, when, as expected, GM appeals.
It is perhaps the largest award ever in a personal-injury lawsuit,
imposing $4.8 billion of punitive damages on a manufacturer whose
fuel-tank design satisfied federal safety requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The jury clearly demanded that car manufacturers value human
life beyond a few dollars and cents. Brian J. Panish, lead attorney
for the plaintiffs, said that GM made a business decision to fight
lawsuits from fuel-fed fires rather than to ``fix something that
wouldn't have cost them much at all.'' In a recent interview, he
said, ``When you make a conscious decision to allow people to burn,
you have to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   But the verdict leaves unanswered what exactly General Motors
did that was reprehensible. The jury may have choked on the notion
that car manufacturers trade off benefits and costs when designing
safety features. But so do government regulators operating on
behalf of consumers. Indeed, economists say, there is no escape
from ghoulish calculation.
</P>
<P>
   The simple fact is that consumers do not want to buy the safest
car possible because they do not want to pay the costs. General
Motors may have taken its calculations to an indecent extreme,
placing too little value on human life. But the jury could not have
logically drawn that conclusion from the evidence presented in
court. The numbers they saw _ the cost of various safety options
per car _ reveal nothing about the sense or nonsense of GM's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Put aside the question of whether the jury's verdict proves that
the nation's tort system resembles a lottery. Put aside questions
about this particular trial _ whether, as GM contends, the judge
prevented it from presenting exculpatory evidence. The immediate
issue is whether jurors were right to rebel against evidence that
purported to show that General Motors made business decisions that
placed profits before safety.
</P>
<P>
   The fuel tank on the 1979 Malibu fulfilled federal regulations,
according to tests conducted by GM. Beyond that, how safe should it
have made the car? Statements that manufacturers are morally
obligated to put costs and profits aside in safety decisions amount
to little more than blather. There is only one way to make a car
safe. Build a 500-ton fortress on wheels, drive at one mile an hour
on highways whose lanes are built, at taxpayers expense, one mile
wide. In short, stop driving because no one could afford the
trillion-dollar price tag.
</P>
<P>
   But were the jurors right to punish General Motors for spending
too little on safety? Panish said: General Motors ``chose to fight
the lawsuits and not spend the $8.59 it would have taken to get
safer gas tanks and no fires.'' The $8.59 figure comes from a
General Motors estimate of what it would have cost to relocate the
fuel tank in a 1973 model to what the plaintiffs argued would have
been a safer position. General Motors says the argument is bogus.
The new position, it says, would not have been safer. Besides, when
the Malibu was redesigned in 1978, the fuel tank could have been
relocated, if the engineers thought it advisable, for nearly
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the $8.59 is taken at face value, it proves nothing.
Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution points out that
positioning the fuel tank is one of many decisions that car
manufacturers must make that affect safety. Each might cost only a
few dollars a car. But take the most expensive option each time and
the cost quickly adds up. The fact that millions of households
choose lighter over heavier cars and forgo extra air bags and other
safety features proves that spending money on safer cars does not
always come ahead of many other needs.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a more profound glitch in the evidence provided to
the jury: none was in the form that would allow juror, government
regulator or anyone else to determine if General Motors made the
wrong call. Jurors needed to take account of how many lives a
safety feature would save. They needed to know, in other words, the
cost of saving a life, not the cost of installing a feature in a
new car.
</P>
<P>
   There were about 40 million GM cars on the roads in the 1970s. A
safety feature that cost $10 a car would cost General Motors, and
therefore its consumers, about $400 million. Suppose, to take an
extreme example, the repositioned fuel tank would save only one
life. Then the safety measure would cost about $400 million for
each life saved. That would be about 80 times, according to Litan,
the figure _ $5 million per life saved _ the government often uses
to decide what safety measures private industry must adopt. If, by
contrast, the repositioned tank would have saved 1,000 lives, the
cost-per-life-saved would be only about $400,000, a fraction of the
amount that government expects business to spend on saving lives.
</P>
<P>
   The jury never learned how much a repositioned fuel tank would
have cost for each life saved, if indeed any lives would have been
saved. The figures it did hear _ costs per car of safety options _
almost always look minute no matter how frivolous the benefit. The
plaintiffs swayed the jury by bandying about a misleading figure.
But $8.59 is an answer to a question no regulator in charge of
consumer safety would bother asking.

NYC EXPANDS MONITORING OF PAROLEES, INCLUDING LATE-NIGHT POLICE
VISITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Late one night in July, police and parole officers
swarmed down on more than 20 parolees in two Brooklyn housing
projects, rousing them from their beds before questioning them
about crimes in the area and forcing them to give urine samples to
test for drugs. Those who tested positive or failed to give samples
were taken to the local precinct house for further questioning.
</P>
<P>
   The raid was part of a widening city effort to monitor parolees
more closely by having police accompany parole officers on some of
their visits. The effort stems in part from police statistics that
show that convicted criminals tend to go back to lives of crime
upon release from prison. But it also reflects concerns nationwide
that the parole system has often failed to monitor released inmates
adequately.
</P>
<P>
   Similar initiatives are being tried around the nation, but the
aggressiveness of the efforts in New York City have alarmed civil
libertarians and even parole officers, who express concerns that
parolees are becoming targets of illegal searches and harassment by
the police.
</P>
<P>
   Further, they say that the police role undermines the main goal
of the parole system: to smooth the way for former convicts to
re-enter society.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials and politicians in New York have lauded the
city's parole efforts, saying that it has been so successful that
they now want to bring all of the initiatives under one task force
and export the tactics to other communities around the state.
</P>
<P>
   They say the effort also reflects a larger integration of the
parole system with police operations, as in recent years police
computers have been linked to databases that include parole
information, letting officers quickly tell, for instance, whether
someone ticketed for littering on the subway is also on parole.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the increased scrutiny of parolees _ and
probationers, under a different program _ is already having a
marked effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about providing safety in our community,'' said
Katherine Lapp, Gov. George E. Pataki's director of criminal
justice services. ``The bottom line is it's better to have two
pairs of eyes watching people in the community rather than just
one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot more to do, but this is a good first couple of
steps,'' she added. ``The proof is in the pudding; we get
results.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Ms. Lapp, the tactics have greatly increased the
number of parolees picked up on warrants. Police officials add that
random sweeps have also helped solve many crimes, said Edward
Norris, deputy commissioner of operations for the Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Norris noted that officers found guns in the homes of two
parolees during a sweep in July, and they used the seizure of the
weapons to coax more information about other crimes from the
ex-convicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of that leverage, they gave up information about
several murders,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how many parolees have been visited during these
joint operations, or how many have been sent back to prison because
parole violations were found, the police said, adding that they are
now attempting to collect data from precincts. There are about
60,000 parolees in the state, roughly two-thirds of them in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, police can enter someone's home _ including a
parolee's _ only with a warrant or in emergency circumstances. But
under the conditions of his release from prison, a parolee agrees
to allow a parole officer inside his home whenever the officer
wishes. All parolees must also consent to drug testing by their
parole officers at any time, and must allow the officers to search
their living areas.
</P>
<P>
   Many parole officers say that in teaming up with them, police
officers have, in effect, been given these powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no problem with trying to elicit information for the
purpose of solving crime, but I do have a problem with some of the
tactics now being used in this initiative,'' said Willis Toms, a
union leader and 14-year veteran parole officer. ``We are not in
the Gestapo; we are in a free society, and some of the
constitutional rights we all have are being violated by the NYPD.''
</P>
<P>
   Denyce Duncan Lacy, a spokeswoman for the New York State Public
Employees Federation, which represents parole officers, said that
several officers filed a grievance a few weeks ago challenging one
aspect of the program, which requires officers to administer spot
urine tests of parolees at the behest of police officers. They
contend that the parole officers should not be forced to handle the
samples.
</P>
<P>
   Police and parole officials say there have been no legal
challenges to the tactics, which some precincts started using about
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Similar programs have cropped up across the country, as states
have clamped down on the parole system. In fact, 14 states have
done away with discretionary parole altogether, something still
being urged in New York by Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of bringing parole and probation officers into closer
cooperation with the police say that initiatives like those now
being used in New York City can forestall more drastic changes to
the system by beefing up the supervision of parolees.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Under the New York City program, parolees who live in high-crime
areas, or who are seen as possible repeat offenders, are singled
out for visits by parole and police officers during special
nighttime operations. Usually, 25 to 30 parolees in one area are
sought out each time, parole officers say.
</P>
<P>
   While parole officers do not normally conduct urine tests on the
spot, they have been instructed to do so using Police Department
specimen containers, according to an internal memorandum put out by
the Division of Parole and obtained by The New York Times by a
parole officer who opposes the policy.
</P>
<P>
   During one operation in July, parole officers were ordered to
handcuff any parolees who refused to take the test, or could not
urinate, and to transport them to the station house, according to a
``statement of fact'' circulated internally in one parole office.
</P>
<P>
   The parole officers were also ordered to ``attempt to gain
permission from either the subject himself or an adult member of
the household to search the subject's living area.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether or not permission to search was granted, we were
ordered to transport the subject to the local precinct for
debriefing by NYPD,'' the statement continued.
</P>
<P>
   Parole officers say such operations have hindered their ability
to do their jobs and led not only parolees, but their families and
neighbors, to see the officers as little more than an extension of
the police force. They say that on several occasions, the police
have also interrogated others in the parolees' homes and conducted
illegal searches.
</P>
<P>
   ``As parole officers, we can search the immediate area where the
parolee sleeps, but we cannot search his mother's room, his
sister's room, or the living room,'' Toms said. ``The police are
coming into these homes in a very abrupt and violent way and
conducting illegal searches.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Schwartz, a 19-year veteran parole officer and union
official, added that parole officers in Far Rockaway, Queens, were
told to do their interviews in the local precinct house. And, he
said, police in the Bronx set up shop in vacant parole offices two
Thursdays every month, handing parole officers a list of people
they wish to question, even though the men are not scheduled to
visit their parole officers on that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are told to come in and then given over to the police for
questioning in a separate room, not for arrest or anything but
interrogation,'' Schwartz said. ``This is what we are seeing a lot
more of, gearing toward regular parolees and using parole officers
to get them started talking about anything and everything the
police want.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lapp said that she knew of no instances in which peoples'
rights were being violated but that her office would investigate
any such allegations fully. She added that once parole officers are
involved in the program and everyone understands his role, ``people
work well together.''
</P>
<P>
   While some attribute criticism of the tactics to union griping,
lawyers with the New York Civil Liberties Union and other legal
experts say that such visits by police officers raise troubling
legal questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general rule is that a police officer cannot go into a
home unless they had probable cause to arrest the person, and
ordinarily there needs to be a warrant,'' said Vivian Berger, a
professor at Columbia Law School, who noted that the initiative
appeared to be ``an end-run and an attempt to piggyback on the
parole system, which is unwarranted and may be harmful.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite constitutional questions about such police tactics, law
enforcement officials justify the initiatives by citing statistics
that show a high recidivism rate among people conditionally
released from jails and prisons.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. Department of Justice, one study of more
than 100,000 prisoners released conditionally from prison in 1983
found that 63 percent were rearrested within three years. Patrick
Langan, a senior statistician with the department's Bureau of
Justice Statistics, added that more than one-third of all homicides
and one-fourth of all killings of police officers are committed by
people on probation or parole or out on bail.
</P>
<P>
   Most initiatives linking police with parole and probation
officers are loosely based on one begun in Boston seven years ago
called Night Light. That operation is conducted in conjunction with
several other programs that have paired social service workers and
ministers, among others, with special sections in the Police
Department, like the police anti-gang unit. The program focuses
mainly on teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Crime experts say that none of the programs have been
sufficiently studied to draw conclusions about their effectiveness.
But the Boston Police Department credits their efforts with helping
to squelch gun violence, saying it may be part of the reason there
has been a nearly 70 percent decrease in the number of people 24
and under killed by guns between 1990 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Detective Gary French, the commander of the Boston Police
Department's youth violence strike force, said that the focus of
that city's effort is on connecting former convicts with their
communities.The Boston program is intended to be
nonconfrontational, is probation and parole led, and was set up
only after consultation with lawyers from the American Civil
Liberties Union, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that his officers do not conduct urine tests or do
searches during these home visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something, like a gun, is in plain view, we get a
warrant,'' he said. ``We don't go on a fishing expedition.''

   ``Sometimes, lights go off when you explain the program to
officers,'' he said. ``There's this idea of, `Hey, this is great;
we can go in and snoop around.' But you have to be very careful,
because one slam-dunk court case can shut all of these programs
down.''

MRS. CLINTON VISITS OPEN HOUSE FOR $1.695 MILLION HOUSE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By TRACIE ROZHON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton, in the midst of a listening
tour around New York State, has limited her house-hunting tour to
Westchester County, where she stopped in at an open house in
Greenburgh on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady inspected a seven-bedroom, turn-of-the-century
Colonial in the Edgemont section. The house, in an affluent
neighborhood near Scarsdale, is priced at $1.695 million.
</P>
<P>
   As a number of real estate agents and their customers arrived to
tour the property around noon, a white van pulled up in front. A
Secret Service detail roamed through the white clapboard house and
asked the other house-hunters to wait on the lawn, said one real
estate agent who was there and who asked not to be identified _ on
orders from her boss, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton emerged from the van and entered the house, at 74
Ardsley Road. After looking around, she apologized to the real
estate agents for keeping them waiting.
</P>
<P>
   The agents said they believed Mrs. Clinton was making an offer,
but Marsha Berry, the first lady's press secretary, refused to
confirm it. She did say that the Clintons were limiting their
search for a home to Westchester.
</P>
<P>
   One agent outside the house said that her own client had been
ready to make an offer on the home. Another agent said, ``We were
negotiating and obviously we're dead in the water.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you want to bid against the first lady?'' the agent
added.`
</P>
<P>
   The 12-room, six-and-a-half bathroom house in Edgemont has a
pillared portico and black shutters. It sits on 3.08 acres, a huge
amount of property for lower Westchester, agents said. They
speculated that Mrs. Clinton needed the acreage for security
reasons. The 4,536-square foot house has a barn _ and an elevator,
along with ``elegant formal entertaining rooms'' and ``modern
eat-in kitchen with pantry and second small dining room,''
according to Doernberg Real Estate's listing on the house.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ardsley Road is one of the busiest roads in the
neighborhood, the house is at the end of a rough-hewn stone
driveway, and cannot be seen from the road. Late Wednesday
afternoon, the agent who shook the first lady's hand said she
thought the price on the house was ``extremely fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Edgemont neighborhood is Greenburgh's fanciest,
brokers have said that prices there can be half of what comparable
houses fetch in nearby Scarsdale. (Much of Edgemont bears the
Scarsdale ZIP code.) One of the reasons for the lower cost of homes
may be that Edgemont has hundreds of co-ops and condominium
apartments _ Scarsdale has only a few.
</P>
<P>
   Sallie Stone, who moved from Scarsdale to Edgemont several years
ago, called her new neighborhood ``a secret place,'' and said it is
not at all like Scarsdale, ``which is mythic, immortalized in
fiction and nonfiction as the perfect example of upscale suburbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Few people know Edgemont,'' she said, ``but the two
communities are really comparable in every way.''

 &HT;    Customs launches policy to correct search system at airports
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Responding to allegations that drug inspections at
airports are racially biased, the U.S. Customs Service announced a
policy Wednesday to ``correct and change the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Oct. 1, customs inspectors will have to obtain
approval from a federal magistrate to hold a passenger for more
than four hours.
</P>
<P>
   If travelers are detained and turn out to be free of drugs,
customs will help with lodging and assist in changing travel plans.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, customs will record the race, gender, age and
citizenship of every passenger it stops. Inspectors have not been
required to collect such information, and what was collected was
assembled inconsistently. That made it difficult for the service to
determine whether minorities were being disproportionately targeted
for searches.
</P>
<P>
   Selecting passengers for searches because of their race is ``not
part of our policy _ we want to make sure it's not part of our
practices,'' Customs Service Commissioner Raymond Kelly told
reporters gathered for Wednesday's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The changes come in the wake of complaints and lawsuits alleging
abusive searches at the nation's airports.
</P>
<P>
   At Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport, inspectors
complained that black travelers were being singled out for
inspections for no reason other than the color of their skin.
</P>
<P>
   At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, a group of 100 black
women sued the Customs Service, alleging they were unfairly
targeted because of their race and gender.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) requested a federal
investigation. Kelly responded by appointing a commission to
investigate the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   During the past several months, Kelly also has made other
changes. Passengers kept longer than two hours are now allowed to
call a lawyer. Supervisors must approve all pat-down searches for
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, customs inspectors searched 52,468 of 71.5 million
passengers. Drugs were found in 2,122 of the searches, which were
conducted by frisking, pat-downs, partial clothing removal or
X-rays.

BABBITT INQUIRY INTO CASINO BID SAID TO END WITHOUT INDICTMENT 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Minn.)   By DON VAN NATTA Jr.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An independent counsel has concluded that there is
insufficient evidence to seek grand jury indictments in the
investigation of Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt's role in his
department's rejection of an Indian casino application, several
lawyers knowledgeable about the inquiry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel, Carol Elder Bruce, reached the decision
two weeks ago after a spirited debate among lawyers in her office
over whether an indictment should be sought, a lawyer with
knowledge of the discussions said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bruce was on vacation Wednesday and unavailable for comment.
A deputy in her office, Cary Feldman, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   But one lawyer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said
Ms. Bruce had already made arrangements to return to private
practice after Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bruce investigated allegations that Babbitt allowed
political considerations, including promised campaign contributions
for the Democratic Party, to influence the Interior Department's
rejection of a Wisconsin casino application in May 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bruce also examined the roles of Harold M. Ickes, the former
deputy White House chief of staff, and Donald Fowler, the former
chairman of the Democratic National Committee, in the casino
matter. No charges against them are expected from Ms. Bruce either,
according to the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bruce investigated whether the White House or the Democratic
National Committee had improperly influenced the Interior
Department's decision to reject the Indian casino. Several wealthy
tribes, who had adamantly opposed the approval because they feared
the competition to their casinos, contributed more than $350,000 to
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Another lawyer with knowledge of the inquiry said Ms. Bruce's
staff was completing a final report on its 17-month-old inquiry,
which it would submit in coming weeks to a three-judge panel here.
Ms. Bruce's decision not to seek indictments was first reported
Wednesday by The Minneapolis Star Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bruce was appointed by a three-judge panel in March 1998 to
investigate whether Babbitt ``may have testified falsely'' before
Congress about accusations that White House pressure influenced the
department's decision to reject the casino proposal submitted by a
group of impoverished Wisconsin Indian tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt testified on June 30 and July 7 before a federal grand
jury empaneled by Ms. Bruce. After completing his testimony,
Babbitt said, ``I came to answer all their questions. I was happy
to do so. It was a very professional atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers declined to say why Ms. Bruce had reached her
decision. But one lawyer familiar with her thinking said that Ms.
Bruce agonized over the decision for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Babbitt said they have not been told by Ms. Bruce's
staff that the inquiry is about to conclude. ``We have had no
communication from the office of independent counsel to this
effect,'' said Roger M. Witten, a lawyer for Babbitt. ``We believe
he did not commit any crime, and we knew this would be the
result.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the tribes, Mark Goff, declined to comment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Three Chippewa tribes and Croixland Properties Inc. had proposed
to build an off-reservation casino at a failing greyhound racing
track in Hudson, Wis. Despite an approval by the regional office of
the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Minneapolis, the Interior
Department rejected the application in May 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt also testified about the matter before Sen. Fred
Thompson's committee that investigated campaign finance abuses. In
his testimony, he denied that the White House pressured him to
reject the casino application, even though a lobbyist for the
casino project, who was also formerly a close friend of the
secretary, testified that Babbitt had told him that there was such
pressure. Babbitt repeatedly denied making false statements to
Congress. He has said under oath that the department's decision was
made on the merits.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the criminal inquiry, the Chippewa tribes have filed a
lawsuit against Babbitt, and three agency employees. In the
lawsuit, the tribes have asked a federal judge to overturn the
Interior Department's rejection of its application.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Ms. Bruce's office asked for a 60-day delay of the
lawsuit's discovery process because she was concerned that it could
hamper her inquiry. At that time, Ms. Bruce informed the court in a
letter that her prosecutors had reached a ``final, critical
stage.''

DIARY DESCRIBES DESERT STABBING, POLICE SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, N.M. _ Raffi Kodikian was a writer and so as he lay
near a dry river bed deep in Rattlesnake Canyon inside Carlsbad
Caverns National Park last weekend he wrote of panic and
desperation, fear and hopelessness _ words police here Wednesday
said amount to a signed murder confession.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wrote about the distress they were in,'' said Gary W.
McCandless, chief of detectives with the Eddy County Sheriff's
Department. ``The journal includes a confession.''
</P>
<P>
   But as authorities here assemble their case against Kodikian,
25, accused of killing his friend David Coughlin, 26, by stabbing
him twice in the chest, the county's chief law enforcement officer
said he does not believe Kodikian's claim that he acted mercifully
to put a friend dying of thirst out of his misery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't hold much water with me,'' said M.A. ``Chunky''
Click, Eddy County's elected sheriff. ``The circumstances are very
bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   Click and McCandless said there are major holes in Kodikian's
story. They said it is unlikely that the version of events as told
by the Boston man about the death of his long-time friend from
Millis is the truth of what happened last weekend in a remote
region of Carlsbad Caverns National Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things that concern me,'' McCandless said in an
interview Wednesday. ``I think one of the biggest concerns is if
they were in that bad a shape, how did (Kodikian) have the strength
to bury his friend, you know? When he was transported to the
hospital, he was released within a couple of hours. And within 30
minutes of his arrival, I was there. He was up walking and talking.
In fact, even the rangers I talked to said he was very coherent at
the site. There's not even an issue of being deranged.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Boston-area medical experts said they doubted that
Coughlin could have been in the kind of agony Kodikian described to
law enforcement authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Click said his office was notified Wednesday that Kodikian has
retained renowned New Mexico criminal defense attorney Gary
Mitchell. A leading death penalty foe, Mitchell has kept dozens of
clients from being killed by lethal injection since the death
penalty was reinstated in New Mexico in 1978. Mitchell did not
return repeated calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities seized Kodikian's diary in a search warrant executed
this week. Besides the journal, Click said they found several
items, which he refused to identify, that appeared to have been
splattered with blood. Under a court order, officials obtained
blood and saliva samples from Kodikian Tuesday, and plan to compare
it to the blood found at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   With incriminating statements Kodikian is said to have made to a
park ranger, physical evidence at the scene, and the diary, Click
said he has no doubt that Kodikian will be brought to justice for
the first known homicide in the history of the 69-year-old national
park.
</P>
<P>
   Because he is charged with a felony, under New Mexico law a not
guilty plea was entered for Kodikian at his arraignment on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Kodikian was released Tuesday on $50,000 bail, which was paid by
his father. Authorities said he can't leave the county without the
court's permission and has been checking in regularly with Click's
office from a location here, which Click would not disclose.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff said the US attorney and the local district
attorney's office will determine what charge Kodikian will face. He
has been charged on an open count of murder. ``It could be capital
murder all the way down to involuntary manslaughter,'' Click said.
</P>
<P>
   That will depend on what authorities conclude happened in
Rattlesnake Canyon last weekend, a popular 2.8-mile trail of rock
cairns and lechuguilla, the cactus plant that defines the arid
desert landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Kodikian and Coughlin, on a final leg of a cross-country trip,
arrived here Aug. 4 and obtained a two-day camping permit. They
drove a long, winding gravel road to a small parking lot and began
a long slow descent on a trail that falls 670 feet to the canyon
floor.
</P>
<P>
   When the men did not return immediately when their free permit
expired, park officials were not concerned. Campers often get
extensions. But when a volunteer spotted their car Sunday, rangers
investigated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ranger Lance Mattson approached the camp site and found the
defendant laying under a tarp,'' according to the criminal
complaint on file in court here. ``The defendant saw Ranger Mattson
and said, `Please tell me you have water.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After Mattson gave Kodikian water, he asked about Coughlin's
whereabouts, and Kodikian pointed to a small nearby mound and said,
``Over there,'' the complaint states. ``Then the defendant told
Ranger Mattson, `I killed him.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After Mattson gave Kodikian some water and took a knife from
him, Kodikian told him the hikers had run out of water and gotten
lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``They became dehydrated and according to the defendant
`(Coughlin) asked me to do it' and they were going to `do it
together.' The defendant explained that his buddy was in a lot of
pain,'' the complaint states.
</P>
<P>
   Mattson said when he moved a flat rock that appeared to be at
the head of Coughlin's shallow grave, he found the body _ which lay
only 230 feet from the trail and about a mile from where the two
Massachusetts men had parked their car.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very cognizant about what was going on around him,''
Click said of Kodikian. ``He asnwered questions rationally. And he
was airlifted to Carlsbad Medical Center and in just a very short
time was in very good shape. It's our belief that he had not killed
this young man that he'd still be alive, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Click called the diary a ``crucial piece of evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, because it's his own handwriting, it's his own
admission,'' the county sheriff said.
</P>
<P>
   Kodikian, a former Boston Globe editorial assistant, had kept
such a journal before. He wrote an account of a cross-country trip
he had taken alone in 1997 after graduating from Northeastern
University.
</P>
<P>
   The journal _ contained in a small spiral notebook _ found by
authorities here was a chronological account of the trip Kodikian
and Coughlin had been on this summer. Click would descibe it only
generally, saying it noted a side trip to Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues of both men said their travels also took them to
Kodikian's parent's home, in Doylestown Pa, through Maryland, New
Orleans and Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Click added that the journal tells of a harmonious sojourn and
its final entry does not contradict the statements Kodikian
reportedly made to the park ranger who found him.
</P>
<P>
   ```There's not any indication of a fight,'' said Click, whose
officers have investigated seven murders in the last 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read it, I felt their emotion,'' said McCandless. He
said the notebook contains two different handwriting styles,
presumably, he said, the work of both men.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell by how articulate they both were that they were
coherent and sharp,'' the detective said. ``I would say it does
show (Kodikian's) state of mind. I didn't see anything that
indicated he was out of his mind or deranged. In fact, I thought
because of how articulate it was written he was pretty sharp.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical examiners in Albuquerque, have examined Coughlin's body
to determine whether he was, in fact, severely dehydrated, as
Kodikian claimed. They are expected to release their results
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-area doctors said it was unlikely that dehydration could
cause the kind of unbearable pain Kodikian said Coughlin was in.
``Dehydration makes you uncomfortable, but it's not acutely
painful,'' said Dr. Ronenn Roubenoff, associate professor of
medicine and nutrition at Tufts University.
</P>
<P>
   Severe dehydration most commonly causes nausea and
disorientation, said Dr. Gary Curhan, medical kidney specialist at
Massachusetts General Hospital. In cases where people lose a lot of
salt as well as water, there can be muscle cramps, too, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin also had urine in his bladder, said Tim Stepetic, of
the medical examiner's office. But that alone may not be enough to
draw a conclusion, local doctors said. Investigators would probably
be looking to see how concentrated the urine was, they said.
Stepetic said those results were not available Wednesday.

temporary agencies instead of casting her lot with a single
employer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began to think that when I get older, if anyone ever asked
me what I had done with my life, all I could tell them about was
work,'' she said. ``I just decided that that would have been a big
waste, so I broke free.''
</P>
<P>
   By going back to school to freshen up her computer skills, Miss
Kitani said she has always been able to find basic administrative
work whenever she needed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I quit one job, I always tell the temporary agency that
I'm in the market for another one,'' she said. ``There are always
jobs opening up, and when a new one becomes available, I switch.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers like Miss Kitani represent the future of the job market
in this country. And like much that is cutting edge at the turn of
the century, it is a future that a crisis-stricken government is
being dragged toward with its heels planted firmly in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years of serious decline in Japan's economic prospects,
the longtime ideal of lifetime employment is becoming an
unattainable dream for all but a shrinking core of workers.
</P>
<P>
   For over a million Japanese, the snug job security of the past
has been rudely replaced by unemployment. Still, for millions of
others, a new way of life that involves job-hopping, temporary- and
part-time work is quickly taking its place.
</P>
<P>
   Though Japan does not keep statistics on the number of temporary
workers, their growing popularity is widely reported by workers
themselves, corporate executives, government officials and
entrepreneurs in the hot new job placement business.
</P>
<P>
   At Japan's leading job placement company, Pasona, executives
report that in less than a decade, the number of requests for
temporary workers has soared from 100,000 to one million a year.
Government bureaucrats report pressure from workers and companies
to ease rules that now restrict job mobility and the temporary
employment agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese workers seem willing to quit jobs when they are feel
they are underpaid or just bored, even at the risk of becoming
unemployed for a time. And increasingly, they are resorting to
private job placement agencies to find new work. But with
unemployment approaching 5 percent _ a postwar record _ the
government has been slow to adapt to this changing scene, and has
only grudgingly begun removing the restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of encouraging bloated companies to restructure, and
making it easier for people to change jobs, the government's
response has been to pay subsidies to companies to hold onto their
workers, even when their positions are no longer needed.
</P>
<P>
   That reluctance reflects a long-held belief that companies are
morally obligated to provide for their employees, even by giving
them make-work jobs rather than laying them off. But Japan's long
economic recession, pressures on companies to become more
efficient, and a growing desire on the part of some Japanese
workers for flexibility and mobility are eroding these beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public has been expressing more interest in temporary
work, and so have the employers, so we are beginning to lift
restrictions on this sector,'' said Masaki Iuchi, a senior labor
ministry official. ``In the past we have always tried to remain in
step with the rules of the International Labor Organization.''
</P>
<P>
   But government officials do not seem to feel any particular
sense of urgency. Last year only about one third of Japan's college
graduates were able to find full-time employment. And yet temporary
agencies are still forbidden from securing work for anyone within a
year of graduation.
</P>
<P>
   Other rules establish mandatory fee schedules, inhibiting
competition among job agencies, or place a number of job categories
off-limits to temporary employment agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Most galling to employees who might want to use temporary jobs
as a steppingstone to permanent ones, the rules limit temporary
workers to one-year contracts, and prevent their immediate re-hire
for the same job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The granting of money to companies to keep workers on the
payroll does nothing to encourage fundamental change,'' said
Yasuyuki Nambu, the founder of Pasona, the job placement agency.
``They are behaving just as someone does when he has a cold:
treating the symptoms but doing nothing about the underlying
infection.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nambu, 47, an outspoken maverick who ranks among Japan's most
successful younger entrepreneurs, said that the problem is that
workers and businesses alike are kept in a ``regulatory cage'' by
the government. ``What we need more of in Japan is the
wilderness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many foreign economists agree with this diagnosis, and say that
the preoccupation with preserving what exists, whether industries
or individual jobs, in a deeply conservative Japan has become a
suffocating obstacle to economic regeneration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without more labor-market liquidity, which would shift human
resources into more productive industries, Japan will not
experience the kind of recovery in productivity, which must be the
foundation of any new growth path for the country,'' said Andrew
Shipley, senior economist at Schroeders Japan Ltd., an investment
bank.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Miss Kitani has little use for the economic
theories used to criticize or justify government policies. Her
observations of the regulations are fueled by the experiences of
someone who, like millions of other Japanese people, commutes for
nearly two hours a day from a bedroom suburb to a job in central
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Over 10 months into her contract in a job that she says she
enjoys, she is already making preparations to leave the company and
look for new work once more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really too bad that I can't keep the job I have now,''
she said, speaking of her work in a job preparing manuals for
engineers. ``In a job like this it takes a certain time to learn
the programs and to get a feel for what you are doing. But by the
time you feel you know what you are doing, because the rules are
the way they are, your time is up.''

LINUX SUPPORTERS SAY ITS DAY HAS ARRIVED 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Linux isn't just a hobby anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the thousands of visitors to the LinuxWorld Conference
and Expo here are serious computer users looking for software to
solve real-world business and technical problems. And many of them
think they've found the answer in Linux _ an upstart operating
system that was virtually unknown just a couple of years ago but
now poses a serious threat to the near monopoly in desktop
computing software held by Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In simple terms, an operating system is the program that
controls the most basic functions of a computer such as reading
information from disc drives. The Linux operating system is
available at little or no cost, as is its underlying ``source
code'' -- the actual coding written by the programmers. As a
result, people around the world can freely use, modify and improve
Linux, without having to pay royalties to a commercial software
company like Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   It hardly seems like the basis for a lucrative business. Yet the
talk of the show is the astonishing runup in the value of shares in
Red Hat Software Inc., a leading Linux provider. One of the best
known names in the young Linux industry, Red Hat makes its money by
selling an easy-to-install version of Linux for those who do not
want to go to the trouble of downloading the operating system, and
providing technical support to users.
</P>
<P>
   Investment bankers priced Red Hat's stock at $14 a share for its
initial public offering Wednesday. But the stock more than tripled
during the day, with shares rising 38 1/16 to close at 52 1/16 on
the Nasdaq exchange. The company, based in Durham, N.C., ended the
day with a market value of $3.48 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many of the world's leading computer companies,
including IBM Corp., Compaq Computer Corp. and Dell Computer Corp.,
have flocked to the San Jose Convention Center to tout Linux-based
products for electronic commerce and corporate network management.
And one of the most famous men in high-tech, Intel Corp. chairman
Andrew Grove, made a surprise appearance to stress that his
company's next-generation microprocessor series, Merced, will be
tuned to run Linux with maximum performance.
</P>
<P>
   Notable by its absence is software giant Microsoft, which finds
itself squarely in the crosshairs of its most unusual adversary
yet. Even Microsoft has expressed public concern about the
competitive threat posed by Linux. Not only is it available for
free, but Linux has also developed a reputation for being more
reliable and stable than Windows for many uses. And many
programmers like the fact that they can modify Linux themselves,
instead of waiting for Microsoft to upgrade the product.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has been touting recent benchmark tests that found
that its Windows NT operating system is better for some heavy-duty
tasks than Linux. Backers of Linux vow that a planned upgrade of
the software will fix these deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   Linus Torvalds, a Finnish computer student who created Linux
with the help of a worldwide team of volunteer programmers led by
the Free Software Foundation in Cambridge, Mass., said there have
been few serious attacks from the Microsoft camp. ``It's been very
mild so far,'' Torvalds said.
</P>
<P>
   He believes that this is because Linux presents Microsoft with a
unique problem. Microsoft has been able to fend off challenges by
traditional software companies simply by using its financial
muscle. In the case of browser maker Netscape Communications Corp.,
Microsoft rolled out a competing browser and gave it away free of
charge. This made it impossible for Netscape to turn a profit by
selling its browser, while Microsoft makes so much profit from
other products that it could afford a loss on browsers.
</P>
<P>
   But because Linux is produced by hundreds of volunteer
programmers worldwide, and available for free, Microsoft's
traditional weapons are of little use against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see see what they can do,'' Torvalds said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, there has been little overt Microsoft-bashing at the
convention -- another sign, perhaps, of the growing maturity of the
Linux market. Instead, visitors are concentrated on an array of new
products for managing Internet commerce, Web site management and
networking issues.
</P>
<P>
   The show floor was a stark illustration of the contradiction at
the heart of the new Linux boom. Large and costly booths show off
new software products, costing hundreds or even thousands of
dollars, designed to run on top of an operating system that's
available for free.
</P>
<P>
   The free-to-all philosophy that underlies the open-source
movemment is so pervasive here that it poses a constant challenge
to companies that expect their Linux-based software to turn a
profit. Charge for your software, and you provide an easy target
for some other vendor who's willing to give away a similar program.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the issue of ``clustering,'' a vital technology for
commercial computing, but one area where Linux lags behind other
operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   With clustering, a group of computers can be linked together to
perform a single task, like running a Web site. If any one of the
machine breaks down, the others automatically pick up the slack.
This capability is vital to the operation of corporate networks and
Internet retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   TurboLinux Inc. of Brisbane, Calif. announced a new clustering
program designed to fill this need. Their product will cost $995
for a basic version, or $1,995 for a version that can be used with
a larger number of clustered computers. But early this week news of
a different clustering program that'll be available for no money at
all.
</P>
<P>
   VA Linux Systems Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif. is mainly in the
business of selling computers with pre-installed Linux. VA
developed a clustering program for use with its new line of Web
server computers, but will give away the software to anyone who
wants it. Indeed, VA says it'll do the same with any software it
develops for use on its own hardware products.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Miller, CEO of TurboLinux, says he's not familiar with the
VA software, but says his firm hopes to offer superior performance
and features, which will persuade customers to pay for the
software. Miller said that as long as some Linux users demand
special features, there'll be room for sellers of ``closed source''
commercial software products. ``I think there's always going to be
a market for bringing the best of both,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Ney views the continuing commercialization of Linux with
a wistful air. Ney is managing director of the Free Software
Foundation, which developed most of the underlying software in
Linux with the intent of giving it away. Now the foundation is
consigned to a small, cluttered booth in the back of the exhibition
hall, overshadowed by the more glamorous displays of the commercial
computer firms.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, the movement created by the foundation is
booming. In the server market, Linux is winning new users faster
than any other operating system. And IDG, the Framingham, Mass.
firm that sponsors LinuxWorld, Wednesday awarded $25,000 to the
foundation for its work in establishing Linux. On the other hand,
newcomers to Linux may be losing sight of the principles of
freely-available software that motivated the Linux pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mixed blessing,'' Ney said with a sigh.

`BOWFINGER' HAS SOME GOLDEN MOMENTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I'm just a white guy from Orange County (California),'' Steve
Martin once told an interviewer. And never has he seemed whiter
than in ``Bowfinger,'' where, as small-time
chiseler/producer/director Bobby Bowfinger, he's trying to sound
like he's down with action superstar Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy).
``It's all good,'' Bowfinger rambles, dropping his voice down into
Barry White territory, ``er, um, it's butter ... um, jiggy, baby
... '' Bowfinger's trying to sell Ramsey on what he thinks is the
best script he's ever read, a project called ``Chubby Rain.'' And
Ramsey, a furious paranoiac with an arbitrary streak a mile wide,
isn't buying. That doesn't do Bowfinger a lot of good, since he's
been told his ``Chubby Rain'' project will get studio financing
only if Ramsey will agree to star in it.
</P>
<P>
   With a brave band of geeks, freaks and nobodies, Bowfinger
decides to shoot ``Chubby Rain'' around Ramsey. That is, he'll
sneak about with camera equipment, catch Ramsey on the street and
have his actors mosey up to the teetering-on-the-cusp-of-sanity
film star and have them recite their lines to him. The movie _ and
this movie _ makes Ramsey even loonier, and he flees into the arms
of an oatmeal-bland religious cult leader (Terence Stamp).
</P>
<P>
   ``Bowfinger'' has a few very funny bits that almost hold the
picture together, but not quite. Such as Heather Graham's brazenly
amoral actress, who right off the bus from Ohio sleeps her way
through most of the crew to get her part increased. And Christine
Baranski's melodramatic vamp, who slinks her way through the part
Bowfinger wrote for her as if she were a female impersonator.
``Bowfinger'' itself teeters on the cusp of insanity, and comes
near to genius. (The way he assembles his filmmaking crew, and
their growing savvy, is a nifty running gag.) It's a movie you may
find yourself wanting to like, because of its audacious premise and
the combination of Martin and Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   It's courageous of Murphy, considering that the Kit Ramsey role
plays on some of the less desirable public notions of Murphy: a
bullying streak toward his toadying entourage; his anger over being
overlooked because of racism; embarrassing off-camera moments. Yet
the central conceit _ a comedy about the desperation of people on
the fringes of the movie business, and what success does to them _
is so promising, you lean forward in your seat with your fists
clenched, pulling for ``Bowfinger'' to succeed. Martin essentially
made himself the straight man. He's very laid back _ maybe a little
too laid back to be believable. But many of the great comic lines
glide in like Roy Jones Jr.'s jab _ so bright and fast you can
barely believe you heard them. (Martin wrote the script.)
</P>
<P>
   If ``Bowfinger'' had the same ruthless mercenary streak as Bobby
Bowfinger, the movie would have a better chance. It's mostly too
nice, reminiscent of the Nora Ephron-directed ``Mixed Nuts,'' a
sappy loser of a picture about a pack of forlorn chumps. (The
niceness _ both in ``Mixed Nuts'' and here _ functions as a form of
patronizing.) Along those lines, Murphy has a dual role. He also
plays Jiff, a shy goof with a remarkable resemblance to Ramsey, who
doubles for the star. And as a reward for endangering his life _ in
scenes that are like those Daffy Duck cartoons where Daffy plays
the sucker-stuntman _ Jiff is allowed to do what he likes doing
best: fetching Starbucks coffees for everyone. Murphy's much better
as the diffident Jiff _ he invests the role with an exactness that
makes it clear that he understands the character.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, when he's playing a part closer to himself _ be it
Kit Ramsey, or the obnoxious Buddy Love in ``The Nutty Professor''
_ Murphy isn't close to believable. He parodies the part, using a
joke voice and a cartoon swagger. He telegraphs his contempt for
these jerks, as if he were doing a sketch. In ``Nutty Professor,''
Murphy gave the performance of his career, and demonstrated his
range. He's still got great work ahead of him, and we get a glimpse
of what he's capable of in ``Bowfinger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bowfinger'' is rated PG-13 for adult language and situations,
and parody violence.

U.S. DIPLOMAT GIVE VOTE OF CONFIDENCE TO COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN OTIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ A senior U.S. diplomat who was dispatched
here amid deepening concerns over the faltering peace process has
given President Andres Pastrana a strong vote of confidence. But he
questioned whether Colombia's rebels were truly ready to make
peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question we have to ask ourselves is if there has been
sufficient action to make the (peace) process worthwhile, and I
think we're on the borderline,'' Under Secretary of State Thomas
Pickering told a select group of foreign journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Pickering, who led a high-level delegation of State Department
officials to Colombia, made the comments late Tuesday after meeting
with Pastrana and his aides for six hours. The Americans, who left
Bogota on Wednesday after spending about 36 hours in the Colombian
capital, were attempting to learn Pastrana's strategy for dealing
with guerrillas, drug traffickers and the country's faltering
economy. Colombia provides an estimated 80 percent of the cocaine
and much of the heroin consumed in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Pickering acknowledged that negotiations require patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us have seen processes that were desultory, moribund
and nonproductive for years (only to) turn around and produce
results,'' he said. ``There is also a very important part of the
negotiating process of keeping the process alive, even it it isn't
immediately producing and bearing ripe fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickering's endorsement was welcomed by Pastrana, whose public
support has dropped sharply during the past months because of his
apparent lack of progress toward ending the country's 35-year civil
war and toward bringing the economy out of a prolonged recession.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the 44-year-old president asked for letters of
resignation from his entire Cabinet, a formality that would allow
Pastrana to remove a handful of ministers regarded as ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, congressional Republicans have been especially
critical of Pastrana's dealings with the country's largest rebel
group, the Armed Forces of Colombia, known by its Spanish initials
FARC. The group has put up to 17,000 fighters in the field, scored
several decisive victories over government forces and became deeply
involved in the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Pastrana withdrew police and army troops from a
southern jungle region the size of Switzerland as a goodwill
gesture to convince the FARC's leadership to enter peace talks. But
the rebels used the zone to launch attacks and stash kidnapping
victims while its leaders refused to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   Alarm bells went off in Washington, said Cynthia Arnson, a Latin
America specialist at the Woodrow Wilson Center, a policy and
research organization in the U.S. capital. ``There's a general
perception that the peace process is going nowhere and that the
guerrillas are advancing militarily,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Colombia, some analysts had expected that Pickering would
urge Pastrana to scrap the peace talks and crack down on the FARC.
Rumors flew in the country that the Pentagon was preparing an
invasion to roll back recent rebel gains, and the speculation
increased following the crash last month of a U.S. reconnaissance
plane in southern Colombia. Five U.S. soldiers and two Colombians
who were conducting anti-drug operations were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The canard floating around is that the United States is about
to introduce a military intervention, which is totally false,
totally crazy,`` Pickering said. ``What we are able to do is
provide training, equipment and other kinds of support to
Colombians to deal with their own problems.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Colombia will receive about $290 million in U.S.
military aid, mostly counter-narcotics assistance for the police,
making the nation the third-largest recipient of American aid in
the world, following Israel and Egypt. Last month, Colombian
officials requested another $500 million over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Romero, the acting assistant secretary of state for
inter-American affairs who was part of the U.S. delegation, said
that specific aid figures were not discussed in the meeting with
Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
   Arnson described the trip was a way for the State Department to
reassert control over Colombia policy. Congressional Republicans,
charging that the Clinton administration has ignored Colombia, were
pushing for more military aid, including sophisticated attack
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Following a trip to Colombia last month, White House drug czar
Barry McCaffrey said Colombia was in ``an emergency situation'' and
called for a $1 billion aid program for the Andean region to fight
drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get the sense that the State Department is interested
in pressuring Pastrana,'' Arnson said. ``It would be more along the
lines of trying to find out how the Colombian government plans to
confront the multiple challenges it faces.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the Colombian
government is on the right track. ``President Pastrana was right to
initiate talks; the question is whether he can muster a combination
of pressure and incentives that will cause the guerrillas to
respond,'' Albright wrote in an op-ed piece published Tuesday in
The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend that the growing levels of military aid and the
parade of U.S. delegations to Colombia constitute intervention in
Colombian affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are being constantly visited and scolded by the State
Department, by McCaffrey and by any North American who gets near
us,'' said Carlos Lemos Simmonds, a former vice president. ``We
have already been invaded.''
</P>
<P>
   But both Colombian and U.S. officials described Pickering's
visit as cordial. Foreign Minister Guillermo Fernandez de Soto said
relations between the two nations are the best they have been in
years.
</P>
<P>
   Pickering heaped praise on Pastrana, who is often portrayed by
his opponents as a political lightweight. ``I think he was very
impressive,'' Pickering said. ``I felt I was dealing with a guy who
was engaged and fully in charge of the details.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickering also described Colombia as one of four countries _
including Indonesia, Nigeria and Ukraine _ that the State
Department is paying special attention to. He said recent political
changes in all four nations provide a window of opportunity to help
transform them into stable democracies.
</P>
<P>
   But when Romero was asked if he thought Colombia's civil war
would end any time soon, he replied: ``No. I'm not that
optimistic.''

 &HT;    Border Patrol beats the bushes
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUNSWICK, Ga. _ It's early afternoon on this hot and muggy
summer day, and Ken Grubb and his classmates are taking one of
their midterm exams. No books or classroom for this test, though.
Grubb and his 32 cohorts in Border Patrol Academy Class No. 405 are
out on a steamy asphalt quarter-mile track. To pass, they must run
a mile-and-a-half in less than 13 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In a short while, they'll be running through an obstacle course
for the next part of their midterm. After that, they'll be off to
weapons training to prepare for their firearms qualification exam
the following week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait,'' said Grubb, 22, an Indiana University of
Pennsylvania criminology graduate who has a cousin in the Border
Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   It's not all physical work for these Border Patrol recruits,
though. A large part of their 19 weeks of training consists of
classroom work: law, Spanish, communications, ethics, computers.
</P>
<P>
   They also spend quite a bit of time on a driving course,
learning how to operate different types of patrol vehicles under an
array of extreme conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In all, recruits undergo 744 hours of training.
</P>
<P>
   Nine classes will graduate this year from the Border Patrol
Academy at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in southeast
Georgia. Another 30 classes will graduate from a satellite facility
in Charleston, S.C. Some Border Patrol recruits, trained either at
the Georgia facility or the South Carolina satellite, also take
advanced training at a facility in Artesia, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very rigorous. They definitely keep you busy,'' said
Lloyd Sams, 31, who is undergoing training in Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who thinks a Border Patrol agent's job consists solely of
capturing illegal immigrants might wonder why recruits have to
undergo such strenuous training, including 62 hours of firearms
instruction. The answer: drug smugglers and people smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   Six Border Patrol agents were killed last year, the highest toll
since the agency was established in 1924.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we tighten up the border, they're getting more desperate,
so they're shooting,'' said supervisory Border Patrol agent William
Maskell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year the Border Patrol makes more than 1 million arrests
and accounts for 60 percent of narcotics intercepted on the
Southern border,'' said Charles L. Huffman, who as chief patrol
agent is in charge of the two academies. ``This, coupled with the
extremely hazardous and difficult terrain our agents must patrol,
makes the Border Patrol one of the most inherently dangerous jobs
in law enforcement. We have had more agents killed in the line of
duty than any other federal law enforcement agency.''
</P>
<P>
   About 25 percent to 30 percent of new recruits have either
military experience or a law enforcement background. The average
age for a recruit is about 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good,'' Huffman said. ``We're getting people with a
little bit of life experience.''
</P>
<P>
   But the tight labor market has hit the Border Patrol, just as it
has other government agencies and private sector companies. As a
result, the Border Patrol is having a hard time recruiting enough
people to fill all the slots authorized by Congress, which is under
increased pressure to do something about illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   With about 9,000 agents already on the force, federal officials
wanted to train 1,994 new agents this year. They fell short.
Through the first week of August, 354 of the 831 recruits who
started training this year had graduated.
</P>
<P>
   The Border Patrol used to get most of its agents from the
military, law enforcement agencies and college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally,'' Huffman said, ``we have not had to do a lot
of recruiting. But those traditional sources have dried up. So
we're going to get serious about doing some recruiting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Border Patrol also is hindered because it's not the first
choice for many potential agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a hard time recruiting people who do the kind of work
that we do,'' Huffman said. The Border Patrol has 90 percent of its
postings in the Southwest, where many prospective agents don't want
to live, and even if they are later assigned to the Canadian
border, most new agents start in the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Huffman said, ``a lot of people don't view
enforcing immigration laws as real law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Border Patrol started hiring women in 1977, reaching a
current level of about 5 percent female. It has had even less
success recruiting African-Americans, who total about 1 percent of
agents.
</P>
<P>
   Huffman said he does not know why Border Patrol jobs have been
unpopular with some minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has been successful in hiring Latinos, who make up
more than 30 percent of the force. Many of them already live in the
Southwest and speak Spanish, a language skill all agents must
possess.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '70s, Latinos became prominent,'' Maskell said. ``I
predict African-Americans will be next.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Teran, a first generation American of Mexican descent, was
learning how to fingerprint and book suspects during a recent
training session. Teran, 29, said his Mexican background will not
affect how he will approach his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not preoccupied about it,'' the Arizona native said. ``I
understand where they're coming from, but we also have our laws.
And our laws are meant to protect the citizens of our nation.
That's first and foremost.''
</P>
<P>
   He's certainly not going to give anyone a break, he said, just
because they come from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Teran, a native Spanish speaker, has an advantage over many
other recruits. Ask any non-native speaker what the most difficult
class is and you invariably get the same answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spanish is the toughest,'' said recruit Matthew Boyd, a New
Mexico native. ``Learning so much Spanish in 15 weeks is tough.''
</P>
<P>
   While Teran was practicing his booking techniques, Boyd and
other recruits were outside undergoing training in how to stop
vehicles and arrest suspects in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Fake gun drawn and crouched behind the open door of his Border
Patrol sport-utility vehicle, Boyd gives instructions to a
role-playing suspect behind the wheel of another car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chofer,'' Boyd said in Spanish through his vehicle intercom,
``levante las manos.'' (``Driver, put your hands up.'')
</P>
<P>
   In short order, and in barely accented Spanish, Boyd has the
suspect out of the car and on the ground in handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, another recruit is going through a similar drill with
Hector Velazquez, a role-playing actor ``nabbed'' behind an
apartment building. The recruit freezes at one point as he
struggles to remember his instructions in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   On the far side of the 1,500-acre federal training center, Tom
McDonnell Jr. and his band of instructors are putting another group
of recruits through driving maneuvers. A thunderstorm approaches
from the west, turning the horizon a purplish gray.
</P>
<P>
   ``We train in all weather,'' said McDonnell. ``The bad guy
doesn't take the afternoon off because of weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the recruits' training includes water anyway, as they
learn to keep their heavy patrol cars under control on a wet skid
pad _ a glass-smooth concrete stretch coated with parking lot
sealant. A sprinkler keeps the surface wet and the cars have
extremely bald tires.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets really exciting in a big hurry,'' McDonnell said as he
put his patrol car into a controlled skid.
</P>
<P>
   Recruits also learn how to keep their Ford Crown Victorias under
control at high speeds as they simulate emergency responses on a
twisty and curvy course.
</P>
<P>
   On another part of the driving area, other recruits are learning
how to maneuver through tight areas in their top-heavy
sport-utility vehicles. This close-quarter driving aims to simulate
conditions in boxy canyons along the Southwest border.
</P>
<P>
   As the day ends, recruits will go to dinner and then back to
their dorm rooms for several hours of studying.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know how to teach you a lot of information in a short
amount of time,'' Boyd said.

JEWISH CENTERS ACROSS NATION BEEF UP SECURITY IN AFTERMATH OF L.A.
SHOOTINGS

<P>
   A police cruiser was stationed on Wednesday outside the Jewish
Community Center in Stamford, Conn., which already had alarms and
security cameras and requirements that members show identification
cards at the door. On Thursday, Jewish family counselors will be on
hand to talk to parents of the young campers there.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, the playground swings were empty and the tricycles
abandoned at yet another Jewish Community Center camp, as children
were kept indoors to play. Two armed guards would patrol for the
rest of the week, an official of the center said, as they did in
the week after the massacre of high school students in nearby
Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   At another center in Tarrytown, N.Y., police cars sat at the
curb on Wednesday and staff members stopped strangers at the door
for identification. A note went home to the parents of 80 toddlers
telling them of the new security measures and offering a prayer for
the children wounded by an anti-Semitic gunman at a similar camp in
Los Angeles on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And so it went, at Jewish summer camps across the country on
Wednesday, after the sweet, waning days of summer were savagely
disrupted by the wounding of three young children in California and
the television pictures of dozens of others, hand-in-hand, being
led to safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we saw those children, it was like we recognized their
faces,'' said Jane B. Rogelberg, executive director of the center
in Stamford.
</P>
<P>
   The centers, most commonly used for recreational programs for
children and the elderly, needed no official orders to beef up
security, but the Jewish Community Centers Association of North
America was leaving nothing to chance. In the wake of the Los
Angeles carnage, the umbrella organization advised centers to
consult their local law enforcement agencies and make detailed
security plans if they did not already have them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our greatest concern is that parents feel reassured, but that
we not overreact,'' said Allan Finklestein, executive vice
president of the association, who noted that every center in the
country was open on Wednesday and ``operating normally.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing we want to do,'' he added, ``is give somebody
like this man in Los Angeles the satisfaction of stopping what
we're doing, or forcing us to create an armed environment.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar balence must be struck regarding enhanced security at
synagogues next month during the Jewish high holidays of Rosh
Hashana and Yom Kippur, said Abraham H. Foxman, national director
of the Anti-Defamation League. Foxman said that Jewish
organizations will hold a national teleconference next week to
discuss security issues for the impending holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have a balence,'' Foxman said. ``Synagogues are
places of worship, places of love, of reconciliation. We don't want
to make them bunkers.''
</P>
<P>
   But individual synagogues are anxious. At Temple Beth El, in the
Long Island town of Lawrence, for instance, Susan Polansky, the
executive director, said the temple had already contacted their
alarm company, inquiring about a surveillance system that would
require visitors to push a buzzer and identify themselves before
entering.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a synagogue and our doors are always open to
everyone,'' she said. ``But this has made us all stop and think.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Temple Israel, a congregation in Memphis, vows it
will not give in to fear. ``In a country where people have to worry
about sending their kids to school, any public building is aware of
the possibility of such violence,'' said Rabbi Henry Danziger.
``Our temple is a public building. But it is also a home and we
don't want to have a fortress mentality.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Danziger, heartened by calls from non-Jews appalled at the Los
Angeles shooting, noted that ``Jews are more secure than we have
ever been, which is part of what makes this such a shock.'' It is
not that there is more hate, he said, but rather new means to act
on it: ``It used to be that they would burn a cross or hand out
literature. Now they go get a gun and shoot at people.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Jews interviewed on Wednesday put the Los Angeles shooting
in the context of months of gun violence, with targets as varied as
athletes and cheerleaders at Columbine High School in Colorado and
day-traders at brokerage houses in Atlanta. For them, the issue was
not resurgent anti-Semitism but rather the easy access to weapons
by mentally-ill people.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of sick people out there with guns,'' said
Ilene Curtach, who was shoppingt at Essen West, a kosher takeout
place on West 72nd St. in Manhattan. ``Nobody is safe anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   But others felt a special risk in their Jewishness, an echo of
the Holocaust in any anti-Semitic attack. ``When you're Jewish, you
live with hate all your life,'' said Debbie Butler, whose children
attend camp at a Jewish Community Center in Hartford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Merle Drake, a Philadelphian visiting Boston's Holocaust
Memorial with her husband and children, agreed. ``On the one hand,
hatred is hatred,'' she said. ``But the overlay of hurting people
who are Jewish has an added dimension.''

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the second consolidation shock to hit the aluminum industry
in two days, Alcoa Inc., the largest producer, said Wednesday that
it wanted to buy Reynolds Metals Co., a troubled competitor that is
nonetheless the third largest player.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came a day after three huge Alcoa rivals _
Alcan Aluminium of Canada, Pechiney of France and Alusuisse Lonza
Group of Switzerland _ announced they intended to merge, creating a
$21.6 billion behemoth called Alcan that would displace Alcoa,
which had $15.5 billion in sales last year. All three foreign
companies had been rumored to be talking to Reynolds themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds said its board would discuss the offer Sunday. But if
Alcoa's proposal were accepted, the merged company's combined 1998
sales of $21.3 billion would put it back within breathing distance
of the top spot. In fact, since the new Alcan derives $17.4 billion
of its sales from aluminum, Alcoa would remain the biggest company
in the business.
</P>
<P>
   While this merger flurry is big news on Wall Street, where both
Reynolds and Alcoa shares rose Wednesday, it is unlikely to have
much impact on the consumers who buy Reynolds Wrap and other
aluminum foils, or the automotive companies designing ever-more
aluminum into their cars.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the mergers result in fewer aluminum producers, aluminum
itself is a basic commodity that is in in ample supply throughout
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither of these mergers, assuming they go through, will have
any impact on aluminum prices, or even on aluminum supply,'' said
Leanne Baker, the metals analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. Even the
heaviest users of aluminum seem unworried. ``Aluminum is a
market-driven commodity, so you've got to presume that the market
will drive the price to wherever it is going to go,'' said Ronald
Iori, a spokesman for Ford Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   The deal may yet run into antitrust opposition. In December 1997
the Justice Department sued to prevent Alcoa from purchasing some
of Reynolds' assets in Alabama, saying the purchase would result in
higher prices. A day later, the companies abandoned the deal.
``Since we looked at the previous proposal, it is likely we'll be
looking at this one as well,'' said Gina Talamona, a spokeswoman
for the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts expect this proposal would survive regulatory
scrutiny. In fact, some analysts suggested that the advent of two
such big deals may help each one go through.
</P>
<P>
   They reason that the Justice Department is likely to look more
favorably on a strengthened Alcoa, now that it has the prospect of
a far bigger Alcan operating across the border in Montreal, while
the European Union will want a bigger presence in the aluminum
industry to fight the specter of a joined Alcoa and Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Alcoa and Reynolds are not mirror images. Reynolds,
for example, is big in aluminum packaging, which Alcoa has shunned.
Alcoa is a huge supplier of aluminum sheeting for cans; Reynolds
divested that business a few years ago.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While aluminum producers cannot affect prices or supply by
joining forces, they can reduce costs and thus increase the profit
from every pound of aluminum they sell. That is something many need
to do.
</P>
<P>
   Aluminum prices have been badly depressed for a decade. First,
the collapse of the Soviet economy led to heavy selling of aluminum
by Russia, a huge aluminum producer, in a panicky quest for hard
currency. At the same time, automakers aerospace companies, and
other huge consumers of aluminum were merging into global giants
with more influence over what they would pay for aluminum, keeping
prices low. General Motors Corp., for example, in November
announced a multi-billion-dollar 10-year contract with Alcan that
provides a steady supply of the metal at a relatively stable price.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that aluminum, which routinely sold for more than
$1 a pound in the 1980s and often spiked far higher, costs 70 cents
a pound or less now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prices have been on such a steady downtrend that many
companies were not even earning their cost of capital,'' said
Warren Spitz, a portfolio manager at Prudential Investments, whose
funds are heavily invested in both Alcoa and Reynolds shares.
``This consolidation is hitting an industry that has had
substandard profitability for at least a decade.''
</P>
<P>
   The news has not been all bad in the industry, of course. As
economies in Asia and Latin America continue to recover, aluminum
demand and prices are expected to increase, ``although even getting
to 75 cents would be worth a hallelujah,'' said James Kelleher, an
analyst with Argus Research.
</P>
<P>
   Aluminum producers also have succeeded in increasing industrial
use of the metal in place of steel. Automakers now use aluminum in
transmissions, wheels, doors and roof racks. The popularity of
four-wheel drive cars has been a boon for the aluminum makers,
since the vehicles require two transmissions instead of one.
</P>
<P>
   GM will use 1.7 billion pounds of aluminum in its cars and
trucks this year; five years ago, that volume was 1.1 billion
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Last year GM cars and trucks contained an average of 275 pounds
of aluminum; this year they contain 290 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of aluminum has increased much faster than anyone had
expected,'' said Daniel Bealko, GM's global commodity manager for
lightweight metals.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, the persistently low prices, combined with the huge
number of plants producing aluminum have kept prices and profits
low. Manufacturers have coped partly by shuttering older plants.
</P>
<P>
   Alcoa, by far the lowest cost producer, has been one of the few
to remain solidly profitable. It also was one of the first to
pursue mergers, buying Atlanta-based Alumax and three European
aluminum companies in the last year. The company earned $2.42 a
share last year. Charles Hill, director of research at First Call
Corp., which tracks analysts' stock recommendations, said that
analysts predict it will earn $2.67 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, by contrast, has foundered. Last year it earned $3.47
a share; this year, analysts predict it will do $2.15 at best. In
this year's first quarter, a bad one for the entire industry,
Reynolds lost 15 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds has spent the last three years trying to restructure.
It has cut costs by closing old plants and selling a number of
operations deemed to be underperformers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977 Reynolds' revenue totaled $6.88 billion; this year they
are unlikely to hit $5 billion. But, that revenue will be heavily
from packaging, construction, wheels and primary aluminum ingots,
the businesses that have historically been Reynolds' best.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were Jerry Sheehan, I'd be terribly frustrated right
now,'' said Kelleher, the Argus analyst, referring to Reynolds
chairman Jeremiah Sheehan. ``He's got to feel, we've restructured
this company, whipped it into shape, done the heavy lifting, and
now Alcoa comes up with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Alcoa's offer was presented to Sheehan in a letter that Alcoa
made public Wednesday. The letter suggested a half-stock, half cash
offer that amounted to about $5.8 billion or $65 a share. Reynolds
had rejected a merger overture from Alcoa in March, saying the
price _ a combination stock-and-cash deal that had Alcoa paying
about $60 a share for Reynolds stock _ was too low.
</P>
<P>
   The price in the offer announced Wednesday pushed Reynolds
shares up $9.375 or 16.8 percent to $65.25. Alcoa shares rose
$2.9375 or 4.4 percent to $69.375.
</P>
<P>
   Still, turning down the March offer has cost Reynolds investors.
The shares of both companies have increased in value, and if
Reynolds had accepted stock from Alcoa, that deal would be valued
today at about $94 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds investors, in fact, have been pushing Reynolds to find
a buyer for some time. Richard Grubman, an investor at Highfields
Capital Management in Boston, which owns approximately 6.5 percent
of Reynolds, wrote Sheehan a scathing letter in June, accusing him
of ``trying to buy time to execute a transaction best for you
before being forced to pursue one that is best for us.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, Sheehan may have no choice but to accept the offer.
Unlike Alcoa, which ranks high on many analysts' lists of
recommended stocks, Reynolds rarely makes it on the Wall Street
recommended buy lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Analysts just do not like this stock,'' said Hill of First
Call. Reynolds executives reportedly spent much of the spring
speaking to all three of the companies involved in the Alcan
merger, in hopes of finding a more generous buyer. None of them
offered a sweeter deal, and now that they are caught up in their
own merger, Alcoa is the only logical suitor left.
</P>
<P>
   Alcoa is being advised by Credit Suisse First Boston. Merrill
Lynch is working with Reynolds.

POSTAL SERVICE INTRODUCES STAMP OF ROGER MARIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 BY JOHN HOLLIS   
 The Gainesville (Fla.) Sun   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ The U.S. Postal Service will unveil a stamp
honoring the late Roger Maris this weekend, and Maris' four sons _
Roger Jr., Kevin, Randy and Richard _ will be on hand at Yankee
Stadium on Friday night when their dad is honored before the
Yankees' game against Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The Marises, who reside in Gainesville and charmed the nation
last summer with their involvement in the home run chase between
sluggers Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, will spend the weekend in New
York as guests of the Yankees as their father receives what they
say is his biggest honor yet. Maris' single-season home run record
of 61 stood for 37 years before falling to McGwire and Sosa last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get yourself on a stamp is pretty prestigious,'' Roger
Maris Jr. said. ``Obviously, being your dad, that makes it nice,
too. For him to be able to get himself on a stamp ... that's
something not many people get to do. It's something the family is
definitely excited about and proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   The process that led to the Maris stamp began in May 1998, when
the American public was invited to vote on which subjects best
commemorated the 1960s as part of the Postal Service's ``Celebrate
the Century'' program. Voters decided on stamp subjects honoring
significant people, places, events and trends of each decade during
the century.
</P>
<P>
   Maris' feat was one of three chosen in the category of sports
from more than 930,000 ballots cast by the public. The other sport
stamps celebrate the birth of the Super Bowl and the Green Bay
Packers' decade of dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the biggest thing is that he was voted in by the
people,'' Randy Maris said. ``It's just a great honor.''
</P>
<P>
   The '60s stamps will become available Sept. 17, Postal Service
spokeswoman Helen Skillman said. Other stamps in the series of 15
include ones celebrating the Beatles, man's reaching the moon and
the Ford Mustang.
</P>
<P>
   ``To think that your dad is going to be on a stamp ... that's
pretty cool,'' Roger Maris Jr. said. ``That's something that's
going to be around forever.''

CLINTON ORDER SEEKS DEVELOPMENT OF RENEWABLE TECHNOLOGIES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will announce a long-term effort
on Thursday to help replace coal, oil, natural gas and uranium with
farm products, crop wastes and trees to make everything from
electricity to pharmaceuticals to car fuel and forks.
</P>
<P>
   In an executive order, the president will set a goal of working
with various industries to triple the amount of energy generated by
such products by 2010. The order, White House officials said, also
will instruct the secretaries of agriculture and energy and the
administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to write plans
to coordinate research, create markets and take other steps to
nurture ``renewable technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration also plans to develop proposals for research
grants and tax credits to promote such technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials predict that developing more uses for
agricultural products will result in $15 billion to $20 billion in
additional farm income by 2010, and less use of imported oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially all of society in the last 100 years has been
built on petroleum as the energy and raw material,'' said a
participant in the effort, Dr. Robert Dorsch, director of
biotechnology development at Dupont.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to go from black gold to green gold,'' Dorsch said.
</P>
<P>
   Dupont is working on an improved polyester based on natural
sugars instead of petroleum, and is hoping that with federal
research money and coordination, the price of such sugars will
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies that have been working with the government over
the last nine months contend that motor fuels, solvents and
electricity can be made from natural materials, known as biomass,
on a cost-effective basis, with a reduction in pollution. The
discussions have included major companies in agriculture,
chemicals, oil, natural gas and forestry, as well as genetic
engineering and other high-technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at taking things we currently just throw away,
making them profitable, fighting global warming and cleaning the
environment at the same time,'' said Roger Ballentine, the deputy
assistant to the president for environmental initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, who has stressed federal promotion of
new technology as well as environmentalism and support for farmers,
said in a telephone interview Wednesday that the initiative will
``help insure that the agricultural economy is part of the new
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president said the effort did not yet involve
allocating money, but that some money would be redirected from
other programs, mostly in the energy and agriculture departments.
He said that more federal attention could encourage use of natural
materials and would be ``a very significant step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, efforts to use natural materials have been stymied
in part by declining prices for oil and natural gas. But proponents
say that the drive to reduce pollution, as well as technological
advances in biology and materials science, will help them.
</P>
<P>
   Biomass now accounts for about 3 percent of national energy use,
including processes as simple as home heating with wood.
</P>
<P>
   Some agricultural processing companies expect big markets if
they can make new products that have environmental benefits.
Cargill Inc., for example, has a venture with Dow Chemical to
produce polylactic acid, a polymer that can be used instead of
petroleum-based products like polystyrene in insulated cups and
polyethylene in soft drink bottles. It can also be used for garbage
bags or for clothing fibers. Unlike plastics, it breaks down
completely in a compost heap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be made from any kind of organic biomass,'' said
Robert Parmelee, president of the bioscience division of Cargill.
It is now made from sugar from corn kernels and other high-value
products, but with a few technical advances it could be made from
parts of the plant with lower value or none at all, like corn
stalks, Parmelee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, if you really want to make this big, then raw
material costs are going to have to come down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government is already involved in many biomass projects, but
the participants see greater potential. For example, the Energy
Department contributed $1.3 million to pay for equipment at
Northern Indiana Power Co.'s Bailly Generating Station to mix wood
chips with the coal. The result was less nitrogen oxide, which
contributes to smog, less sulfur dioxide, which makes acid rain,
and less carbon dioxide, which is believed to cause climate change.
</P>
<P>
   But the company would like to try a different system of using
wood, cooking it into a gas that can be burned at very high
efficiencies in a turbine, according to Arthur Smith, the
environmental officer at Nisource, which is Northern Indiana's
corporate parent.

(EDS: Accompanies CORNWELL-MYSTERIES (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patricia Cornwell became one of the most successful _ but far
from the only _ mystery writers who turned earlier careers into
whodunit gold when she based fictional chief medical examiner Kay
Scarpetta on her own tenure in a medical examiner's office.
</P>
<P>
   The modern-day crime hound was created by Dashiell Hammett, who
modeled Sam Spade and his now-lesser-known Continental Op on
Hammett's own experiences working for the Pinkerton Detective
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1960s, Ian Fleming and John le Carre topped
bestseller lists by drawing on their clandestine work for the
British government to dream up James Bond and George Smiley,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Cornwell's modern-day peers are also translating their
own lives and former day jobs into fiction. The most blatant is
former country singer Kinky Friedman, who has published a dozen
novels in which murderers are tracked down by a former country
singer named Kinky Friedman.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Kellerman's bestselling mysteries feature made-up
psychologist Alex Delaware. Kellerman, who quit the psychology
profession when his third Delaware yarn became a bestseller, says
he prefers writing fiction to professional papers because ``it is a
pleasure not to have to footnote.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys-turned-novelists are common in today's publishing
world, led by former prosecutor Scott Turow. ``Presumed Innocent''
was his first bestseller based on professional experience;
``Personal Injuries,'' the latest, will be published in October.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists are often eager to create fictional alter egos.
Perhaps best-known among these is Britt Montero, a crime-solving
police reporter for a major Miami newspaper and the brainchild of
Miami Herald writer Edna Buchanan, who in real life won a Pulitzer
Prize for crime reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, mysteries are not the only genre in which authors
turn their own lives into autobiographical fiction. Mark Twain
worked aboard river steamboats when he was still called Sam
Clemens. And Joseph Heller and Norman Mailer translated World War
II service into classic novels _ ``Catch-22'' and ``The Naked and
the Dead.''

 &HT;    Heritage students return to smooth first day
 &HT;    By Will Anderson and Pete Scott
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The conversation on the first day of school at
Heritage High School was about rules and summer vacations, students
said, not about last May's shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, it's pretty much a silent issue. We know it, but we
don't talk about it,'' said Student Council President Brad
Harrison. ``They just kind of want to get out of limelight and move
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of Heritage's 1,400 students reported for classes,
and school officials said the day went off without a hitch. During
homeroom, students listened to a videotape on school rules and
polices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably one of the smoothest beginnings that we have
had with exception to the traffic,'' said Heritage Principal Lowell
T. Biddy. ``I have never seen students so glad to see each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Police and school officials kept traffic flowing as it
bottlenecked near the school's main office. Even though numerous
students live within walking distance of Heritage, many were picked
up and dropped off by their parents.
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon, word had spread that a Rockdale County judge
had transferred Anthony ``T.J.'' Solomon's case to Superior Court,
where he would be tried as an adult. Students said it was the right
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty happy about it,'' said Harrison. ``I don't know how
long he should go to jail, but I think he should be there more than
four years.''
</P>
<P>
   After school, about 15 members of the Heritage Patriots track
team grunted and groaned as they jogged their way up a hill along
Ga. 138 in 95-degree heat.
</P>
<P>
   A block away, Matt Sawyer, Eric Zunno and Jonathan Conti
reflected on the school day as they walked home.
</P>
<P>
   To Sawyer, 16, it was ``weird.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many more rules. Like the one about not wearing
excessively baggy pants,'' said Sawyer, whose pants were slightly
baggy. There were more teachers in the doorways and hallways when
classes changed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can still talk and congregate in the commons area (where
the shooting took place), and we did talk about what we did over
the summer,'' said Sawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer said he's not afraid to be back at Heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's not going to happen again,'' he said.

 &HT;    Teen charged in school shootings to be tried as adult
 &HT;    By Leon Stafford and Henry Farber
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Citing ``an appalling disregard for the community,'' a
Rockdale County judge ruled Wednesday that Anthony ``T.J'' Solomon
should be tried as an adult for the May 20 shooting rampage at
Heritage High School.
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile Court Judge William Schneider moved the case to
Superior Court, saying he does not believe the 15-year-old is
mentally ill, as Solomon's lawyers contend.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the Rockdale shooting _ exactly one month after
the massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., that
left 15 dead _ was not accidental, the judge said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the child has attempted to copy a heinous and
devastating crime through premeditation and deceit makes these
actions even more egregious,'' Schneider said in his ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Six students were wounded at Heritage; all survived. Solomon
could face more than 350 years in jail if convicted of all 21
counts against him, which include aggravated assault, cruelty to
children and weapons possession.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager will remain at the Gwinnett Youth Detention Center
until after his trial. Even if convicted in Superior Court, Solomon
would remain in the juvenile prison system until he is 17. Solomon
sat with his head down for much of the two-hour hearing and
displayed no emotion when he was led out of the courtroom. His
stepfather, Robert Daniele, dropped his head into his hands, while
his mother, Mae Dean Daniele, huddled with attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Garland, the boy's lead attorney, said he probably will
appeal the judge's ruling to the Georgia Court of Appeals. That
process could take at least three months. ``We disagree
respectfully with the court's decision,'' Garland said. ``It's bad
when we take a sick, mentally ill young kid and throw him on the
trash heap of the adult prison system.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockdale District Attorney Richard Read, who repeatedly referred
to Solomon as a ``juvenile delinquent'' during the hearing, said he
will seek a grand jury indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the families of the six students injured in the May
20 shooting, who sat through three days of sometimes emotional
testimony, left the courtroom in silence, filing out quickly and
meeting in the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Cheek, father of senior Jason Cheek, who was shot twice,
said Solomon should get adult treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was obvious from the evidence that this was a copycat on
Columbine,'' he said. ``We've got to stop this kind of thing. It's
torn our community apart. He needs to be accountable and the
message needs to be sent.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Cheek still has a bullet in his pelvic area but is well
enough to return to the Heritage football team, where he is
expected to start at outside linebacker for a third consecutive
year.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Barnhardt, father of 11th-grader Brian Barnhardt, called
the ruling fair. ``The bottom line is the punishment should fit the
crime,'' he said. ``I feel for T.J.'s parents, but we could have
had six fatalities.''
</P>
<P>
   The Danieles, walking hurriedly from the courthouse, declined to
comment. Attorney Garland said, ``They are very, very sad. She is
grieving and has been grieving.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they believe Solomon does suffer from
depression, but that it is not acute and that he demonstrated his
awareness of what he was about to do May 20 in several ways:
</P>
<P>
   _ A note he left under his bed about his plans.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bombmaking instructions he printed out.
</P>
<P>
   _ The two guns and extra ammunition he carried to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   _ His warning to two classmates as he entered the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a 'me' crime,'' Read said in closing arguments. ``It
was all about making me, T.J. Solomon, feel better.''
</P>
<P>
   But Garland said the clues were too blatant to be the work of
someone in a healthy mental state. ``All the comments to the kids
at school was a cry for help unrecognized,'' he argued.
</P>
<P>
   Heritage students returned to school Wednesday, about eight
hours before Solomon was bound over to adult court. Their reaction
to the judge's decision was mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Sawyer, 16, a junior, said, ``He should be tried as an
adult. There isn't any reason for a kid to go into a school to
start shooting. When you do that, you're an adult.''
</P>
<P>
   Courtney Waters, a senior at the school, was not convinced. ``I
don't think that he should be punished as an adult, but he deserves
to be punished,'' said the 17-year-old, who had a class with
Solomon.
</P>
<P>
   To seek an insanity verdict, legal experts say, Solomon's
lawyers would have to prove the minor was not able to differentiate
between right and wrong at the time of the shooting. People may
lose that ability if they are delusional, said Atlanta attorney
Brian Steel. An example would be a teen who opened fire at his
school believing that his friends were being held hostage, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depression does not deprive a person of the ability to
appreciate right from wrong,'' said Michael Welner, assistant
professor of psychiatry at New York University's School of Medicine
and an adjunct law professor at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh,
Penn. Welner said the fact that Solomon concealed his weapon and
left a letter saying he knew there would be consequences for his
actions indicates he was in touch with reality.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible verdict is ``guilty but mentally ill.'' Anne
Emanuel, law professor at Georgia State University, said treatment
programs for such offenders have not been adequately funded, so the
treatment envisioned when the Legislature created the law allowing
such a verdict is not carried out.
</P>
<P>
   Steel agreed. ``They're just treated like every other prisoner,
except they might be given medication,'' he said.

CITY SUSPECTS POISON AS BIRDS DROP DEAD IN CENTRAL PARK 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A young girl was chatting with a friend in the
northeast section of Central Park on Wednesday when a pigeon fell
at her feet, dead.
</P>
<P>
   The girl, Victoria Sweet, 11, said that she and her friend
``were just scared and sad to watch Mother Nature just fall from
the tree.''
</P>
<P>
   Between Tuesday morning and Wednesday afternoon, 30 pigeons, 10
sparrows, one grackle and two ducks were discovered dead in the
park, Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern said at a news conference
near the Harlem Meer. And yes, he said, poisoning was suspected, as
stricken birds continued to fall to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poisoning of innocent animals is an outrage,'' Stern said,
quickly acknowledging that the precise cause of death would not be
known until state conservation authorities in Albany completed
autopsies in about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But the commissioner said he strongly suspected that the Central
Park birds were being killed by the same fiend who has been
targeting city birds since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In August of that year, the first evidence of poisoning emerged
when a sick red-tailed hawk was found on Fifth Avenue and 74th
Street. The hawk, which was found to have ingested a very powerful
pesticide called carbofuran, recovered. But the hawk's mother was
killed by the same poison two months later. Since pigeons are the
principal food of hawks, Parks Department investigators reasoned
that the hawks must have eaten pigeons that had been fed poisoned
seed.
</P>
<P>
   The poisonings continued in July 1998, when there were numerous
reports of dead pigeons from the Upper East Side and West Side to
Times Square. Forty dead sparrows were found in a parking lot on
97th Street and Columbus Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1998, several groups of 10 to 20 dead pigeons
were found on the Upper East Side. Autopsies revealed carbofuran in
the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Stern said that the culprit faced criminal prosecution, though
he did not yet know what specific city or state law would be
applicable. Killing the ducks, sparrows and grackle would be a
violation of the Federal Migratory Bird Act, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stern said he would ask the Manhattan district attorney for a
jail sentence for the perpetrator. ``As long as he's on the loose,
the pigeons and ducks and birds of this park are in danger,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A reward of $1,000 has been offered by the City Parks
Foundation, a private philanthropic group, for information leading
to the arrest and conviction of the bird killer.
</P>
<P>
   Parks Department workers discovered the first dead birds on
Tuesday morning. Seeds and bread crumbs at the scene were collected
for examination. Police emergency tape blocks off the areas where
the crumbs and seeds were found, and law enforcement officers are
on duty to steer children and dog walkers away, said Bob Lawson, a
department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner acknowledged that his agency often complained
about pigeons and that he had many times advised the public not to
feed them. But, he emphasized, the Parks Department does not kill
them. Ed Skyler, a spokesman for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, said
that no city agency killed pigeons or any other birds.
</P>
<P>
   Building owners can legally control the pigeon population by
employing a trained and licensed exterminator who uses the
pesticide Avitrol. Both houses of the State Legislature passed a
bill allowing localities to ban the use of Avitrol, but the bill
was vetoed by Gov. George E. Pataki. Wednesday at the Harlem Meer,
which attracts birds year round, women pushed baby strollers and
camp groups marched in single file as birds struggled and died.
Eric Erickson, an unemployed man who visits this part of the park
every day, said, ``I've never seen anything like this. It's a sick
act.''
</P>
<P>
   Doubtless the most informed person on pigeons in the area was
Sean Fine, a producer and cameraman who is filming a documentary
about pigeons in New York City for the television series ``National
Geographic Explorer.'' As he photographed the death scene, he said
that there were approximately as many pigeons in the city as people
and that they had originally been brought from Europe as a source
of fresh food.
</P>
<P>
   Fine had a theory on why the killings were happening. He pointed
to an article about the earlier killings in the current issue of
New York magazine, and suggested it had motivated the killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some person is just laughing in people's faces,'' he
said.

SHARK EXTENDS INFLUENCE TO INTERNET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Chatted with the Shark the other day.
</P>
<P>
   We weren't in a press room, or hooked up via telephone, which is
how these conversations are usually conducted. Greg Norman and I
and a passel of other writers and public relations types sat down
in cyberspace, where reality is as virtual as a computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   Norman the golfer is a guy's kind of a guy, so we knew who was
typing as soon as the chat got under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi guys, this is Greg, a.k.a. the Great White Shark. Thanks
for coming,'' Norman typed.
</P>
<P>
   The ``guys'' thing did it for me. Also the fact that the typer
knew his nickname.
</P>
<P>
   So for the next hour we were virtual chatter boxes. The
conversation was as much about serious business as golf, since
Norman has put up a Web site, www.shark.com.
</P>
<P>
   Norman said _ or typed _ that the site will be free.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of ads, we're still a young site, but we're in
discussion with existing companies that I have relationships with.
We'll give them the opportunity to advertise on Shark.com, as well
as other advertisers. But at the end of the day, Shark.com will
wash its own face,'' Norman typed.
</P>
<P>
   The site is billed as a dynamic online lifestyle destination
broken down into content channels labeled ``play,'' ``live,''
``indulge,'' ``experience,'' and ``signature.''
</P>
<P>
   With the career Norman has had, we all know that these are areas
in which he is quite comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will be able to ``play'' lifestyle sports like golf,
``live'' a quality of life by improving fitness _ at least their
finger muscles; ``indulge'' in life's finer things like wine, which
the Shark is now making; and ``experience'' exotic travel
destinations. The ``signature'' channel will feature panel
discussion with a variety of experts and special guests.
</P>
<P>
   One of those experts will be Norman himself, especially in light
of the flap about paying players who compete in the Ryder Cup, a
topic that has gotten plenty of attention at this week's PGA
Championship, the last major of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Norman has his own version of the Ryder Cup, the President's
Cup, in which the U.S. team competes against the whole world except
Europe, which manages to clean our collective clocks every other
year.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Norman is ahead of the curve on this controversy.
He managed to avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very sensitive topic,'' he typed, ``and I look
forward to addressing that on Shark.com soon. I do believe that
there is some merit to both sides of the argument, but the only
experience I know is through the President's Cup, where the players
there get $50,000 for their respective charities. I hope this
doesn't continue to be an issue every time the Ryder or President's
Cups take place.''
</P>
<P>
   While Norman chatted a lot about business, he did address some
golf-related issues, too. After all, that's still his main
business.
</P>
<P>
   He tees it up today in the PGA Championship at Medinah Country
Club and for the first two days he will play with David Duval and
Fred Couples in one of the tournament's marquee pairings.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, major championships tend to bring out the martyr
rather than the champion in Norman. His conquests have been few and
his collapses and tragic misfortune well documented.
</P>
<P>
   He's proved he can play golf and handle disaster.
</P>
<P>
   And Norman will be on somewhat familiar grounds this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having last played Medinah when (Hale) Irwin won the U.S.
Open, I felt I was in contention to win there, so I look forward to
getting back there to see the changes. I'm feeling very good about
my game and I'm not concerned that I haven't played since the
British Open,'' he typed.
</P>
<P>
   Ga-ga for golf: Nobby Orens, director of golf research at Plaza
Travel in Encino and a nutty golfer, is shooting for a place in the
Guinness Book of Records.
</P>
<P>
   He's also in hot pursuit of the title of the world's nuttiest
golfer by globe hopping from course to course.
</P>
<P>
   Recently he played in London, New York and the San Fernando
Valley. All in the same day.
</P>

RELIEF FOLLOWS SURRENDER OF JEWISH CENTER SHOOTING SUSPECT 
</HEADLINE>

   LOS ANGELES _ The gunman accused of wounding an adult, a
teenager, and three children during a terrifying rampage at a
Jewish community center surrendered quietly Wednesday, sending
shudders of relief and revulsion through the city as his ties to
white supremacist groups became known.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 24 hours after he allegedly sprayed the center's lobby
with gunfire, Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr. turned himself in 275 miles
away in Las Vegas, a destination he told authorities he took two
taxicabs to reach. He also reportedly told them he intended the
attack as ``a wake-up call to America to kill Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Although local and federal investigators are exploring possible
links between Furrow, 37, and neo-Nazi groups, they said he
appeared to have acted alone. His surrender put an end to the
massive manhunt that began minutes after Tuesday's midmorning
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   At press conferences in California and Nevada, law enforcement
officials declined to say what might have motivated Furrow to buy a
GMC van in Tacoma, Wash., on Saturday, drive to Los Angeles, and
shoot up a community center summer camp in suburban Grenada Hills
with a semiautomatic rifle.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jewish leaders, most of whom had urged caution in the hours
after the attack, were less circumspect Wednesday. While declaring
his an assault against all Americans, they also said that it
increasingly appeared to be aimed at a specific religious group.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more, the facts point to a crime motivated by hate,''
said John Fishel, president of the Jewish Federation Council of
Greater Los Angeles. ``Part of it is about violence in America and
hate generically, but it's becoming obvious that he had more in
mind than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the hateful evidence that Jewish leaders pointed to
include Furrow's own history and the van he abandoned near the
scene of the shootings before allegedly carjacking a Toyota sedan
at gunpoint. The van was filled with ammunition, survival gear, and
a book some called a manifesto of sorts for white supremacists.
</P>
<P>
   The Toyota was found parked outside a motel in another San
Fernando Valley suburb, leading to a room-by-room search by SWAT
teams.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Spokesman-Review of Spokane, Furrow is a former
Aryan Nations security guard who lived with the widow of the
founder of a hate group called the Order. A former recruiter for
neo-Nazi groups who now works to combat hate groups said he knew
Furrow as someone available to teach hand-to-hand combat at Aryan
Nation festivals in Idado.
</P>
<P>
   ``What transpired was not only as hate crime, it was a terrorist
attack,'' said Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the Simon
Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles. ``Someone doesn't drive a
floating ammunitions dump 1,400 miles and happen to walk into a
place with little kids without doing a lot of advance work or
having help on the ground. . . . As soon as we saw that book, we
knew we were dealing with the new (modus operandi) of domestic
terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Chillingly, Cooper added that Furrow recently visited the
Wiesenthal center, whose multimedia exhibits teach about the
Holocaust, events such as the Los Angeles riots, and tolerance.
Staff members recognized Furrow's widely disseminated photograph,
he said, and recalled him as someone who had little interest in the
exhibits and fled before security guards could escort him out. The
implication was that he was casing the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``The $64,000 question is why this Jewish Community Center in
this suburb of Los Angeles,'' said Tamar Galatzen, western states
associate counsel with the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai Brith in
Los Angeles, which is organizing a security seminar for Jewish
institutions. ``We haven't been able to figure out his ties to the
area. . . . But I heard that he said he wanted to kill Jews. That's
pretty clearly an anti-Semitic statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Reports of anti-Semitic incidents rose slightly nationwide last
year and were also up in the city, although none have occurred
recently, according to the Anti-Defamation League. In northern
California, however, three synagogues were set afire a few months
ago in Sacramento, and neo-Nazi literature has been left outside
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles County district attorney planned to charge
Furrow with five counts of attempted murder. But by late Wednesday,
the US Attorney's Office in Los Angeles had still not identified
the attack at the North Valley Jewish Community Center as a hate
crime, which would allow Furrow to be prosecuted under federal
statutes. Authorities said they were still sorting out the chain of
events and discussing whether the state or federal governments had
jurisdiction over his prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   But it appears likely that the federal government will charge
Furrow in the nearby slaying of a postal worker, Joseph Ileto, 39,
who was returning to his mail truck when he was shot. Although
ballistics tests have not been completed, authorities said the
shootings appear connected by both proximity and timing. Ileto was
Filipino. Killing a federal employee engaged in his job can carry
the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're relieved he did not carry out a more spectacular plan,''
said Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard Parks. ``We can speculate as
to how much greater (the damage) could have been, how much more
serious. We believe the five victims was enough for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a series of school shootings and other mass killings in
recent years, the ages of some of the victims stunned Los Angeles
and the nation. The youngest, a 5-year-old boy, was hit in the
stomach and abdomen and remains hospitalized in critical after
undergoing surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Also wounded were the center's 68-year-old receptionist, who has
been released from the hospial, two 6-year-old boys, and a
16-year-old girl who was a summer camp counselor. The three
youngsters are in stable condition. Scores of other children
witnessed the shootings and their aftermath, some too young to
grasp what ugliness had occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, armed guards were posted at the community center and
at other JCC facilities in the region. The North Valley day care
center was open as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all relieved that Buford Furrow is in custody,'' said
Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan. ``Our community can rest assured
that he will not bring any more harm to our children and other
innocent Angelenos.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks said investigators were in Las Vegas to determine whether
Furrow would return to Los Angeles voluntarily. If not, extradition
proceedings will be started.
</P>
<P>
   It was unknown where Furrow has been living since he was
released from a Washington jail in May after being sentenced to
eight months for second-degree assault. The Seattle Times reported
that his conviction stemmed from Furrow's attempt to have himself
committed at the Fairfax Psychiatric Hospital in suburban Seattle.
He pulled a knife on staffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was how I didn't want it to turn out; I was hoping it was
just a madman,'' said Esther Netter, executive director of the
Jewish Community Centers' Zimmer Discovery Children's Museum in Los
Angeles. ``As a Jew, I find this abhorrent. As an American, I find
it equally abhorrent. . .This is meant to terrorize the public.
This is not a crime of passion, this is a crime against Jews and
against America.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr., a white supremacist
suspected in the shooting of five people at a Jewish community
center here, turned himself in to the FBI on Wednesday morning,
saying he wanted the attack to send a message to the nation,
law-enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But law-enforcement officials also said that Furrow admitted to
fatally shooting a Filipino-American letter carrier, Joseph Ileto,
shortly after the first attack. Conviction in the death of Ileto
could carry a death penalty, since he was shot while on duty for
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow, 37, surprised officials by showing up at the FBI office
in Las Vegas at 8:55 a.m., after eluding a police dragnet by taking
a taxi 275 miles across the desert, and paying a $800 fare, then
spending the night in or near the city, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow said that he fired at the day center, a federal
law-enforcement official said, because ``he was concerned about the
decline of the white race and he wanted to send a message to
America by killing Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles was a city of anger, fear and relief on Wednesday,
with security tightened at many Jewish organizations alarmed by the
seeming randomness of the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan also sought to ameliorate the shock by
insisting people should not allow fear to change their lives. ``Let
us not let this incident cause us to lead our lives in terror,'' he
said. ``Our city is made up of people who care for each other, who
respect each other and who want our children to live their lives
without fear.''
</P>
<P>
   The police said Furrow had been ``very cooperative,'' and that
he would be brought back to Los Angeles within a day or two if he
does not fight extradition.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow's surrender touched off a fierce behind-the-scenes
struggle over who would try him first. Los Angeles officials want
to prosecute the man they say is responsible for a crime that
shocked their city and federal officials are eager to try him on
charges that could lead to his execution.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles District Attorney's Office and the U.S.
Attorney's Office here had said that they planned to file charges
on Wednesday, but late in the day, when it became clear that
questions of jurisdiction were not resolved, they both said charges
would have to wait.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow, who lived in Washington state, has belonged to white
supremacist groups in the Pacific Northwest for several years.
After his arrest on assault charges last year, he told officials
that he had fantasized about committing a mass killing.
</P>
<P>
   The police said he came to Los Angeles with a daunting arsenal
of weapons, including an Uzi machine gun, a high-powered rifle and
hand grenades.
</P>
<P>
   The police would not detail what Furrow had told the phalanx of
local and federal investigators in Las Vegas. But one person said
police believed he had acted alone in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the five people shot at the Jewish community center in
the San Fernando Valley suburb of Granada Hills, two children at a
day camp there, a receptionist and a teen-age volunteer, are in
stable condition and recovering. But a 5-year-old boy shot in the
leg and the abdomen remained in critical condition after undergoing
more than six hours of surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow's confession to the shooting of Ileto, 39, was a major
break, one person with knowledge of the investigation said, since
there were no witnesses to the murder, which took place on a leafy
street of ranch-style houses and horse corrals, and there was no
other direct evidence linking Furrow to it. .
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, police had been baffled by the seemingly random
murder and said they did not know of any connection between it and
the shootings at the community center. A Postal Service
spokeswoman, Pamela Prince, said Ileto was a part-time Post Office
employee and was not on his regular route when he apparently just
chanced upon Furrow on a street a few miles from the community
center.
</P>
<P>
   Police on Wednesday sounded almost relieved that Furrow had not
shot more people, given the preparations he had made. ``It appears
to be an arsenal with someone who had an intent to create a
significantly larger tragedy in the city,'' said Bernard Parks,
chief of the Los Angeles Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   The North Valley Jewish Community Center was heavily guarded on
Wednesday morning, and some of the parents insisted that, while
they were frightened, they wanted to attempt to return to normalcy
as soon as possible. Many parents and some officials struck a note
of defiance, taking pains to say that such attacks would not force
them to alter their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Bendavid-Arbiv, the mother of two girls, 5 and 7, brought
her children back to the day camp on Wednesday, but admitted that
her children had been afraid. ``That's why we're here, to see that
their friends are still here and their counselors are still here,''
said Ms. Bendavid-Arbiv.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Rouss, executive vice president of the community center,
said, ``We want to show that an act of terrorism will not stop the
Jewish community in the North Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there were concerns at how Furrow amassed such an
arsenal, transported them here and then vanished in spite of the
intensive police manhunt thrown up almost immediately after the
first shootings on Wednesday morning.

FAA WILL PROPOSE REMOVING INSULATION WITH FLAMMABLE COATING FROM
BIG JETS

 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Aviation Administration will propose
extensive modifications on 700 passenger jets to remove insulation
that is covered with a material that can be ignited by small sparks
and cause fatal fires, the agency said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In almost a year of research since a Swissair MD-11 caught fire
and crashed on Sept. 2, 1998, near Halifax, Nova Scotia, killing
all 229 people aboard, inspectors have found that the covering has
burned on a number of planes, evidently because of sparks from
wires.
</P>
<P>
   The Mylarlike substance covers insulation, mostly fiberglass,
that is used to keep many plane cabins warm and quiet. Officials
said such insulation could not have caused the Swissair crash, but
more fire-resistant insulation might have prevented it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This insulation sits in the airplane very innocently most of
the time,'' said Beth Erickson, the FAA's director for aircraft
certification. But, she added, ``If it has an arc or a small spark,
it will ignite.''
</P>
<P>
   In its proposal, which will be published soon for a 45-day
comment period, the FAA says that a ``harmless electrical arc''
could turn into a larger fire because of the insulation. If the
proposal is adopted in its current form, the airlines would have
four years to comply.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing the insulation would cost from $380,000 to $880,000 a
plane, a total of about $255 million for the planes involved, which
include the DC-10, MD-11, MD-80, MD-88 and MD-90. All are products
of Douglas or McDonnell Douglas, which is now a part of Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   The work is not only expensive, it also requires moving many
bundles of fragile wire.

   ``It's most important that you do it right, because you can get
collateral damage,'' said Thomas McSweeny, the FAA's associate
administrator for regulation and certification.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian crash investigators are still trying to determine the
cause of the Swissair crash, although the source of the fire is
presumed to be wiring. They support the FAA's proposal, Ms.
Erickson said.
</P>
<P>
   Diana Cronan, a spokeswoman for the Air Transport Association, a
trade organization that represents the major airlines, said,
``We've expressed serious concerns to the FAA about moving
prematurely on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's ever performed this sort of insulation replacement,''
she said. ``We don't yet have a complete picture as to how it will
be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing said in a statement that it had recommended replacing
such insulation in August 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The aviation agency is also proposing a new way to test
insulation. The current method is to hang a strip of insulation
over a lit Bunsen burner. But the test does not distinguish between
insulation that resists sparks and insulation that burns easily,
Ms. Erickson said.
</P>
<P>
   A second method, developed by Boeing but not used in government
testing, involves soaking a cotton swab in alcohol, lighting it and
pushing it into a piece of insulation. But the FAA said that test
produces inconsistent results on identical samples.
</P>
<P>
   The new test is based on one developed by the American Society
for Testing and Materials, an industrial standards group, and was
originally used for flooring. The sample is heated to several
hundred degrees, then exposed to flame for 15 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Some insulation now in use, which would not be replaced under
the proposed rule, cannot pass the new test, but does not
constitute an ``unsafe condition,'' Ms. Erickson said.

FLEET, BANKBOSTON SHAREHOLDERS APPROVE $16B MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Shareholders of New England's two leading banks
Wednesday overwhelmingly endorsed the merger of their institutions,
a landmark deal that would create the nation's eighth largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, BankBoston Corp. stockholders approved the
company's plan to be acquired by rival Fleet Financial Group Inc.
Fleet's shareholders also approved the $16 billion combination.
</P>
<P>
   The votes, tallied in recent weeks and announced Wednesday at
extraordinary shareholders' meetings for both companies, came as
the two banks inch closer to selecting buyers for the branches and
deposits they are selling to meet antitrust requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Winners in the divestiture, the largest ever in the banking
industry, could be announced as early as next week, said sources
familiar with the merger. At stake are 290 branches across
Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island with more than $12.5
billion in deposits.
</P>
<P>
   A trade publication, American Banker, said Wednesday that
Detroit-based Comerica Inc. _ a midsized bank in the upper Midwest
with operations in Texas and California _ was a finalist. Fleet and
BankBoston officials declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   More than 78 percent of BankBoston's outstanding shares were
voted in favor of the deal, comfortably above the minimum
two-thirds required. Some stockholders abstained from voting, but
of those who cast votes, more than 95 percent favored the
combination. About 79 percent of Fleet shareholders approved the
merger, above the minimum 50 percent needed. Of the votes cast, 98
percent were in favor.
</P>
<P>
   The two banks still face hurdles. The Federal Reserve and
Justice Department are reviewing the proposed merger for its impact
on competition and lending to low-income communities. State
officials also must sign off on the acquisition, which the banks
expect to close in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet is swapping 1.1844 Fleet shares for each BankBoston share,
a ratio that valued BankBoston at $53 a share when the deal was
announced on March 14. BankBoston shares dipped after the
announcement but have since recovered. They rose 1 3/8 to 40 7/17
Wednesday. Also on the New York Stock Exchange, Fleet shares rose 1
1/16 to 40 7/16. The stock is down 4 percent since the deal was
announced.

<P>
   MONTEREY, Va. _ The endless bawling of calves being separated
from their mothers sounded doubly pitiful Wednesday here at the
auction block. For the cattle ranchers were hurting, too, as they
unloaded their livestock at an emergency sale in order to cut their
mounting losses from the deepening drought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of water, out of grass,'' said Swanson Dowling, one of the
local ranchers who came by the Monterey Livestock Sales auction
yard to commiserate and reluctantly shed large parts of herds,
which are proving increasingly expensive to maintain given the
searing heat and the lack of rain.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency sales this month and last in some of the
hardest-hit areas of Virginia and West Virginia are providing a
graphic measure of the economic impact of the drought gripping the
nation's Eastern farm belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I estimate we'll lose 10 percent of the state's 21,000
farms,'' said Gus Douglass, commissioner of agriculture in West
Virginia, where the entire state _ like all of Connecticut and
parts of New York, Virginia and four other Eastern states _ has
been declared a federal farm disaster area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having a most unusual mass marketing of livestock all
through the drought region,'' Douglass said, adding that ``35
percent of our water wells have failed'' in West Virginia. He noted
that the state had been forced to start laying pipe to tap into
emergency flood control dams in the areas suffering the most and to
haul water in by National Guard tankers.
</P>
<P>
   The severity of the conditions varies widely across the
drought-hit Middle Atlantic States. In Pennsylvania, the nation's
fourth-largest dairy state, milk production is down at least 20
percent because of the drought, according to state agricultural
monitors. Estimates of losses in basic crops like corn, soybeans,
feed hay and garden vegetables vary from 30 percent to 100 percent
across the state, said Bob Bunty, spokesman for the Pennsylvania
Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, where farmers are searching for ever more costly
feed beyond their seared fields, the state is instituting a cover
crop program in an effort to retain moisture and prevent soil
erosion. Under the program, emergency plantings of barley, rye and
winter wheat will be undertaken with 87 percent state financing _
provided that enough ground moisture arrives by autumn planting
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main concern now is that the pasture land in central
Maryland is all burned out and our farmers are already dipping into
winter supplies,'' said Harold Kanarek of the state Agriculture
Department. ``We had droughts in '97 and '98, and this might be the
one that pushes farmers over the edge,'' Kanarek said of the fears
of failure among hundreds of the state's 12,000 farms.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing new under the sun about the risks and vagaries
of the agricultural industry. East of here, there are wineries
anticipating a bumper crop of grapes that are sweetening
beautifully now in the relentless blaze of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   But here in the rich Shenandoah region, vital pastures glare
fallow in endless swaths of yellow worthy of van Gogh, long burnt
out by the 14-month-old drought. Feed intended for winter use is
already running short, and water is being hauled. No end of the
drought is predicted, and ranchers warn that problems can compound:
Free-flowing water is healthiest for stock, while ponds and other
still waters that are now the emergency resort increase the risk of
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sold a $100 ton of hay for $150 here two weeks ago,'' said
Kenny Hoffman, a buyer from Columbia City, Ind., who brought the
hay in when he came to bid at the emergency cattle auctions. ``That
farmer turned around and sold it for $200. That's how bad things
are here.''
</P>
<P>
   And Dowling, a rancher for 25 years, said: ``There's never been
a time like this. Old-timers are saying not since the dust-bowl
days of the '30s.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally calves far fatter and more profitable would come to
auction in the autumn. But ranchers are being forced either to run
up more debt by buying feed and hauling in water or to cull their
herds earlier and far more deeply than usual.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate result is a price perhaps $100 less than a calf
would typically fetch, or about $3,200 less for Dowling's
yearlings. The owner of a larger ranch just over the state line in
West Virginia suffered a $40,000 loss in similarly having to cut
corners.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the calf sales, the longer-range threat is that ranchers
like Dowling are also being forced to sell their mature cows and
bulls _ as much as two-thirds of his basic 40-head herd, he said.
They thus reduce their reproductive inventory and their ability to
rebound from the drought.
</P>
<P>
   Douglass, the West Virginia agriculture commissioner, said this
forced culling meant that genetic lines of the ranchers' foundation
herds would be damaged well after the return of the rains.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing surviving out there is the chicken industry,''
Douglass said. ``But their wells are starting to go dry, and that
could create a domino effect.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, West Virginia may be forced to consider curtailing
water to a principal chicken processing factory in Moorefield, a
town on the Potomac River, in order to guarantee good water to
communities downstream. This could affect 1,700 slaughterhouse
workers, which, in turn, could crimp the livelihood of hundreds of
poultry broiler growers.
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, the region's chief poultry state, officials say the
large agribusiness producers are weathering the drought so far with
no threat to production. These companies have multiple deep wells,
but officials are nonetheless tracking them, given that rainfall in
the last year is 14 inches below normal for the region.
</P>
<P>
   In Monterey, ``we've never moved anywhere near this amount of
livestock in July and August,'' said Sherry Sullenberger, manager
of the Monterey Livestock Sales auction yard, which has put on
three emergency sales, with others scattered all about the
Virginias. ``But our hay crop is probably less than half of what it
should be. Some farmers have even come in and gotten rid of all
their sheep. Some are going to have to go out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Out in the yard, truck after truck arrived with cattle to be
auctioned to buyers mainly from the West, where ranchers hit hard
by drought two years ago are buying to rebuild their herds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's grim around here,'' said one bidder, a middleman who uses
video and cell phones in handling sales. ``These ranchers are so
discouraged. Their calves are averaging 100 to 200 pounds lighter
than usual, and they know they can only dip into herd assets for so
long for a problem that's been running nonstop for 14 months.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, some of the ranchers in leather chaps stared morosely as
they prodded and shouted the cattle into the auction pens in a hot,
dusty scene marked above all by the bawling of calves.

ADVERTISING: RODALE PRESS PROMOTES NEW `NEW WOMAN' MAGAZINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)   (bl)  
 By JANE L. LEVERE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rodale Press is hoping that a redesigned New Woman magazine,
backed by a multimillion-dollar advertising and circulation
campaign, will revitalize the publication.
</P>
<P>
   Rodale, a publisher in Emmaus, Pa., which also produces Men's
Health and Prevention, bought New Woman from Primedia in late 1997
and will introduce a redesigned version with the September issue.
</P>
<P>
   Under the guidance of Judith Coyne, a former executive editor of
Glamour who has been editor in chief of New Woman since November,
and the art director Marcos Gago, a former art director of Vogue,
the magazine will feature a new logo, a redesigned cover and inside
pages, heavier paper and features on topics like practical fashion
and the benefits of turning 30. Ms. Coyne began phasing in the
changes earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   To bring the overhauls to the attention of readers and
advertisers, Rodale is spending close to $5 million on direct mail
and newsstand circulation drives and on a trade advertising
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The redesign is the latest of many attempts by New Woman's
owners, which have also included News Corp., to make the
29-year-old magazine more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   It has undergone a series of incarnations. Samir Husni, a
professor of journalism at the University of Mississippi who tracks
magazines, described it as initially a cross between Cosmopolitan
and Ms.
</P>
<P>
   It first reprinted articles from other publications and later
evolved, under Primedia Corp., into a magazine that was ``slightly
more with-it than Glamour and slightly less sex-oriented than
Cosmo,'' said Dan McNamee, a magazine consultant in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Life under Rodale has been no less uneventful. Since buying the
title, Rodale has hired a publisher, Laura McEwen, a former
publisher of Snow Country; has hired and dismissed one editor,
Clare McHugh, previously an editor of Maxim, and has hired Ms.
Coyne and Gago.
</P>
<P>
   These changes have wreaked havoc, and New Woman's ad sales have
fluctuated wildly. According to Media Industry Newsletter, which
tracks consumer magazines, the ad pages sold by New Woman rose 14
percent in 1995, to 985, but less than 4 percent in both 1996 and
1997. Then last year, the number plummeted more than 35 percent, to
680.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McEwen attributed the decline at least in part to Rodale's
ban on alcohol advertising, which she said had made up about 10
percent of New Woman's ad sales before Rodale's acquisition.
According to Media Industry Newsletter, ad pages sold from January
through August this year is flat compared with sales in the
corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Total average paid circulation, meanwhile, has also declined,
from 1.3 million in 1994 to 1.18 million last year, according to
the Audit Bureau of Circulations.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McEwen said the revamped New Woman, which will focus on
beauty, health, fashion and fitness issues, is aimed at the
25-to-40-year-old reader, ``a more grown-up woman in a category
long skewed to younger readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes us unique,'' she said. ``We have a fresh tone
that's smart and empowering for women. Cosmo does sex better than
anybody, and that's not our area. InStyle, Allure, Cosmo and
Glamour do celebrities effectively, and that's not our area. No
woman's magazine will have as personal and intimate a feeling,
something that is very natural for Rodale. We feel we can be a
leader in this area.''
</P>
<P>
   To promote New Woman to readers, Rodale is spending $750,000 on
a direct mail campaign, created in-house, that will begin next
month. It is spending $3 million more on a three-month national
newsstand sales drive in supermarkets, bookstores and airports that
will also start in September.
</P>
<P>
   Rodale also hired Ziccardi &AMP; Partners Inc., a New York agency
that has done sleek, sophisticated advertising for Ellen Tracy, the
clothing designer, and Departures, the travel magazine published by
American Express Co., to create a $1 million trade advertising
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Ziccardi's ads contain visual and verbal puns intended to draw
attention to what the agency calls the magazine's ``cool way to
reach 3.5 million smart, confident women.''
</P>
<P>
   One ad, called ``Power Book,'' shows the magazine turned on its
side and opened like a book. ``Turn it on and connect with the new
New Woman,'' the ad urges.
</P>
<P>
   The ads, will run later this month in trade publications like
Advertising Age, Cosmetics World and Women's Wear Daily and on
telephone kiosks in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Greenberg and Roberta Garfinkle, who oversee print media
at Grey Advertising and at McCann-Erickson, respectively, both like
the redesign of New Woman, which they said catered effectively to
the audience it hoped to attract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will do very well, because a busy woman's life
style requires a publication that delivers a great percentage of
what she needs to know in a single place,'' Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's ability to draw advertisers will depend on
whether it ``delivers the editorial product it says it will,'' Ms.
Garfinkle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If readers come, circulation will grow and advertisers will
come,'' she said. ``I think it really has a good shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are more skeptical. Husni, for instance, said he doubted
that New Woman would find a ``miracle cure'' in its redesign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is tough to break into, because women's magazines
are becoming more specialized,'' he said. ``And it has had too many
changes over a short period of time. Leaving your audience behind
and getting a new audience has never worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Comparing New Woman's editorial strategy to that of Conde Nast's
Glamour and Hearst's Cosmopolitan magazines, Martin S. Walker, a
magazine consultant, suggested that the Rodale title needed ``more
scintillating stuff'' to be perceived as hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Rodale won't allow it to compete on this level, and they
will have a problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that Hearst and Conde Nast publish several
magazines that can be sold as a package to advertisers. Rodale, he
said, lacks that kind of bundling ability because it does not
publish as many titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they'll get circulation to create interest,'' he said
of New Woman, ``but they'll have a very difficult time getting
advertising because they can't package it.''

   The Revolution remain in contention for the fourth playoff place
in the Eastern Conference, a point behind fourth-place Tampa Bay
with two fewer games played. The Krafts cannot be blamed for past
failures, since they only purchased the Clash this year, but the
team has won only twice in regulation time while remaining
mathematically involved in the Western Conference race.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a season, every team has a bad period,'' Revolution
player-coach Walter Zenga said Wednesday. ``Our bad period has
happened now. In the last four games, Miami has (9) points and we
have zero. But we have 12 games left to see if we are a team or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenga (left knee contusion) will be replaced by Jeff Causey in
the starting lineup for the first time this season but should
return for Wednesday's game against Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came back this year to bring this team to the playoffs,''
Zenga said. ``At the end of the season we will see if we did a good
job. Now, the team has to understand the importance of this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of similar struggles by rivals, the Revolution would
remain in the playoff picture regardless of the outcome of this
game. Zenga, though, responded to such a consideration with an
Italian epithet that is almost untranslatable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to lose and we lost three games in a row, then
tied in Colorado,'' Zenga said. ``It's not the end of the world if
we lose, only because soccer is a sport. I can only say that I want
to win every game.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Colorado we were a good team. After losing three games in a
row, we showed a great mentality. We gave all we had, and we have
to do the same in this game.''
</P>
<P>
   That spirit of self-sacrifice likely prevented a couple of
Colorado goals, but also resulted in some precarious situations
such as when defender Ted Chronopoulos and Zenga collided late in
the game. Yet, this kamikaze mentality seems to suit the
Revolution. The team has seldom performed well unless it sets the
tone with aggressive, pressing defensive tactics and opportunistic
strikes by the offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution strategy has been to depend on defensive pressure
to create much of the offensive chances. There appears to be plenty
of firepower with Ariel Graziani, Joe-Max Moore, and Giovanni
Savarese available in attack, and John Harkes, Jair, and Ivan
McKinley in midfield.
</P>
<P>
   But the Revolution have struggled to achieve a balance between
offense and defense or to form a clear identity. They began the
season in a defensive mindset, but seemed to have lost that edge in
surrendering 11 goals in the first three games of the second half
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to win, we have to play with everything we have
inside,'' Zenga said. ``We have to think of the crowd, of our
owners, of ourselves.''

 LOS ANGELES: Wednesday morning.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The spree began shortly after 10:45 a.m. Furrow strode into the
North Valley Jewish Community Center on Rinaldi Street, which is
next to an Episcopalian church in a quiet, middle-class
neighborhood, and used an Uzi submachine gun to shoot first the
68-year-old receptionist, and then the four youngsters. Police said
he shot more than 70 rounds in just a few minutes, then raced out.
</P>
<P>
   Police said that he escaped in a red van that he had purchased
on Saturday in Washington state and used to transport his arsenal.
About 20 minutes later, he abandoned the van near the Van Nuys
airport and carjacked a Toyota Corolla. About 40 minutes later,
Ileto, the postal worker, was shot in the head, chest and shoulder
and killed. There were no witnesses, but neighbors on the street in
Chatsworth, heard shots and called police.
</P>
<P>
   The police conducted a door-to-door search for the suspect
around the community center, but found nothing. The stolen Toyota
was found in the parking lot of a hotel in the same vicinity about
4 p.m. Police cleared the area and surrounded the hotel, but Furrow
was gone.
</P>
<P>
   He told the FBI on Wednesday morning, law enforcement officials
said, that he paid a total of $800 to take a taxi to Las Vegas.
When he showed up at the FBI office on Wednesday morning he was
unarmed, said Sgt. John Pasquariello of the Los Angeles Police
Department, who flew to Las Vegas on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Prince of the postal service said that Ileto, who was not
married and had no children, had been a letter carrier for just two
years but had received several commendations for his hard work.

USA HOCKEY TO NAME SMITH TO COACH US WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It looks as if Ben Smith will be behind the bench in Salt Lake
City. USA Hockey is expected to announce Thursday that Smith, who
coached the 1998 US women's Olympic hockey team to a gold medal in
Nagano, has agreed to a contract extension through July 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to stay in coaching, and I wanted to stay in coaching
in the best environment that I've been in, so I'm really excited to
be able to continue this,'' said Smith Wednesday. ``Why give it
up?''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who still lives in his hometown of Gloucester, joined USA
Hockey in 1996 as the first full-time head coach of the women's
team, which was headed toward the debut of women's hockey as an
Olympic sport in Nagano. A 1968 Harvard graduate, he spent nine
seasons (1981-1990) as the top assistant at Boston University
before being named head coach at Northeastern in 1991, where he
spent five years. Smith also served as an assistant coach for the
1988 men's Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   Although Smith's name surfaced in connection with several job
openings over the past six months, including coach of the Harvard
men's team and executive director of USA Hockey, in the end the
53-year-old elected to stay put.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having reached the pinnacle of women's ice hockey in Nagano,
not many people would have opted to accept the challenge a second
time,'' said Doug Palazzari, executive director of USA Hockey in a
statement praising Smith's decision.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that 1998 was a special moment unlikely to
be recaptured _ and that media scrutiny is bound to be more intense
this time around _ Smith said he isn't worried that 2002 could be a
letdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now comes a new set of circumstances, a new team, new faces,
new competition, a new venue,'' he said. ``So it's kind of starting
over.''

WITH CONCERTS AND WEB SITE, U.N. AGENCY ATTACKS POVERTY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Germany, Denmark, Britain, Switzerland)   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bidding to fight poverty with music and megabits, the U.N.
Development Program and Cisco Systems Inc., the No. 1 maker of data
communications gear, have enlisted a dozen popular entertainers to
kick off an Internet-based initiative to help the world's poor.
</P>
<P>
   The new project, called Netaid, appears to represent the most
extensive partnership the United Nations has formed with private
enterprise in trying to relieve poverty in the developing world.
The development program is casting about for ways to advance its
anti-poverty mission even as countries including Denmark and
Germany have slashed their contributions to the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco, which makes much of the complex communications equipment
that forms the synapses of cyberspace, has agreed to underwrite the
Netaid project with assistance from KPMG, the consulting firm, and
Akamai Technologies, an Internet communications concern. Cisco and
KPMG have each agreed to spend up to $20 million on the project,
according to people close to the companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unprecedented in that we on many fronts are starting
to engage with the private sector,'' said Mark Malloch Brown, who
took over as administrator of the UNDP last month after serving as
a vice president of the World Bank. ``However, there has been
nothing attempted on this scale and of this ambition before. For
us, this is a quantum step up from the previous level of
collaboration with the private sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Netaid's public debut is scheduled for Oct. 9, when the group
will stage overlapping concerts at Giants Stadium in New Jersey,
Wembley Stadium in London and the Palais des Nations in Geneva,
featuring musicians including Jimmy Page, Pete Townshend and Jewel.
The MTV and VH1 cable television channels have agreed to televise
the concerts in the United States and the British Broadcasting
Corp. will televise the concerts in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   But Cisco and Malloch Brown say that Netaid is not yet another
charity telethon. The heart of Netaid is not the concerts, they
say, but a Web site (www.netaid.org) that is being created to allow
people around the world to participate in anti-poverty efforts long
after the music is over.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site will be intended to allow, say, a church group in
Iowa to make contact with a needy church in Indonesia. The UNDP
plans to work with nongovernmental organizations to develop the
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money raised is not the measure of success of this
project,'' Malloch Brown said in an interview Wednesday. ``This is
organized very diferently from the earlier things like `We Are the
World' or `Live Aid,' which were intended to meet the immediate
knee-jerk fund-raising potential of the event. For me, the money
will come, but it will come out of building a very large group of
people in the millions who will keep coming back to the issues
through the Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``People who write their congressman or organize a
local chapter of Oxfam will be making at least as significant and
perhaps more significant contribution than someone who writes a $15
check.''
</P>
<P>
   The other musicians and groups scheduled so far to appear at the
Netaid concerts are Bush, The Corrs, Counting Crows, Celine Dion,
Eurythmics with Annie Lennox, Wyclef Jean with Bono, Michael Kammen
and Orchestra, George Michael and Robbie Williams.

ACTOR WARREN BEATTY WEIGHS RUN FOR PRESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Warren Beatty, who played a senator crazy enough to speak the
truth in ``Bulworth,'' said Wednesday that he was considering
running for president in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty, who has been active in the Democratic Party for years,
made it clear that he was displeased with Vice President Al Gore
and former Sen. Bill Bradley, the current candidates for the
party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret that I am a liberal Democrat,'' Beatty said in
a telephone interview from his home in Los Angeles. ``I have some
very strong feelings, the most important of which at the moment is
campaign finance reform because its tentacles reach into every
other issue. I fear we're getting closer to a plutocracy than we
want to, and I believe that deep down the people want to do
something about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hinting that he would position himself as a liberal alternative
or even run as an independent, Beatty acknowledged that he has had
discussions with liberals who have helped Jesse Jackson in past
campaigns. They include Steve Cobble, a former political director
for Jackson's National Rainbow Coalition, and Robert Borosage, who
has worked for progressive advocacy groups.
</P>
<P>
   He also has spoken with Ellen Miller, who heads Public Campaign,
a Washington organization that has called for reforms in the
campaign finance system. ``He's thinking about this very
seriously,'' Ms. Miller said in an interview. ``He's thought a lot
about it in the last few weeks. There's a hunger out there for a
nonpolitician. And he is increasingly angered by the choice of
candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Beatty emphasized that he did not consider himself the best
candidate, but he did not seem ready to rule himself out. ``There
certainly should be someone better,'' he said. ``That's not to say
that I don't have very strong feelings on a lot of things that
aren't being spoken.''
</P>
<P>
   Beatty suggested that he had been approached about running.
``It's kind of an awkward thing,'' he said. ``I don't think anybody
should be in a position of having to say, `Please don't say things
like this to me.' I want to be very respectful of the people who
have made the suggestion to me.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that people should not question his commitment to
the issues or his understanding of politics, saying, ``I've been
active in politics for 35 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Beatty said he would not respond when asked whether he had been
approached by representatives of Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota to
run for president on Ventura's Reform Party ticket. Asked what
ticket Beatty wants to run on, Ms. Miller said, ``It could be
Democratic, Reform Party or independent.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout two interviews Wednesday, Beatty was skittish about
discussing his intentions, but resisted several opportunities to
dispute that he had designs on the White House. ``If I said to you,
`This is something that I would be considering,''' he said, ``then
your headline is, `It's something I would be considering.'''
</P>
<P>
   Arianna Huffington, a syndicated columnist, raised the notion of
Beatty's candidacy in a column that was published on Tuesday. She
quoted a close friend of the actor, former Sen. Gary Hart of
Colorado, as saying, ''I have a notion that Warren could dramatize
politics in a way that hack politicians never could.''

HOUSTON TO COLLECT DATA AS WAY OF BATTLING `RACIAL PROFILING' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Urban League information, quotes from The Rev. Al Sharpton,
defense attorney Johnnie Cochran and Philadelphia Police
Commissioner John F. Timoney are included) 
 
By S.K. BARDWELL 
and LORI RODRIGUEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Police Chief C.O. Bradford ordered Houston officers
Wednesday to begin collecting data on the age, race and sex of
every citizen they initiate contact with.
</P>
<P>
   The information will be used to determine if officers are
detaining, questioning or otherwise initiating contact with people
because of their race.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford and Mayor Lee Brown said, however, that they did not
think ``racial profiling'' was common practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know if it is a problem here in Houston,'' Brown said
at a news conference. ``But we owe it to the community to find
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of three of the department's employee groups _
including the largest, the Houston Police Officers Union _ appeared
with Brown and Bradford to show support for the program. Some
Houston officers believe the plan will be copied in the coming
months by law enforcement agencies all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford acknowledged, however, that officers do have concerns
over the new procedure. Some have said it will simply intimidate
officers from initiating contact based solely on their suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   And when an officers does detain someone for questioning, they
say, if that person isa minority the officer may be more likely to
write a ticket or make an arrest. That's because taking no formal
action might cause officials to think the contact was unnecessary,
and made only because of the person's race, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned about that,'' Bradford said. ``We'll have to
work through it. Racial-profiling data collection has aroused law
enforcement officers across America. But we must collect the
data.''
</P>
<P>
   Racial profiling, the practice of suspecting a person of
possible criminal behavior primarily because of the person's race,
has been spotlighted by several recent, highly publicized
incidents.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, Amadou Diallo, an unarmed West African
immigrant, was killed in February when four New York City police
officers, apparently mistaking him for someone else, fired 41
bullets at him.
</P>
<P>
   Also in New York City, two police officers have been convicted
of sodomizing and torturing Abner Louima, a Haitian immigrant,
while he was being held for questioning in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In December in Riverside, Calif., police shot a black woman in
the back 12 times as she sat in her car.
</P>
<P>
   That same month, a Pittsburgh police officer shot a black man in
a chase. The officer said he feared being run over, but his
reasoning was undermined by the finding that the motorist had been
shot through the driver's side window.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman fired the state
police chief after he said blacks commit more crimes. State police
were already under attack for allegedly using a racial profile to
stop motorists on the New Jersey Turnpike, a major drug-trafficking
corridor.
</P>
<P>
   In June, President Clinton directed federal law enforcement
agencies to begin collecting information on the race, age and sex
of people they detain, as a first step toward determining whether
minorities are unfairly targeted for scrutiny. He also called on
state and local police forces to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   For about a month, Bradford said, Houston officers must fill out
paper forms after each contact they initiate. After that, patrol
cars should be modified so the form can be filed electronically.
</P>
<P>
   Some aspects of the compilation and analysis of the forms are
still under scrutiny, Bradford said. For instance, a method must be
found to interpret the data collected from an officer assigned to a
beat whose population is mostly of one race.
</P>
<P>
   Any officer against whom a complaint of racial profiling is
sustained will be disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   ``All sustained cases of racial profiling must equal a violation
of civil rights, which is a felony,'' Bradford said. ``Racial
profiling is a criminal offense, and will be treated as such.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Urban League on Wednesday ended its annual
conference in Houston, saluting Brown for the new policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What communities of color want is equal protection under the
law, equal application of the law,'' said Hugh B. Price, executive
director of the league, during a town meeting at the George R.
Brown Convention Center on relations between police and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would it be like for whites if they were privileged to
receive equal abuse under the law?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Price pointed to the Woodstock '99 festival in upstate New York
last month, which ended in fires, riots and even some reported
rapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state troopers had their pictures taken with naked
girls,'' he said, ``but I didn't hear about anybody getting shot by
the police.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the panel, which included The Rev. Al Sharpton,
president of the Nation Action Network; defense attorney Johnnie
Cochran and Philadelphia Police Commissioner John F. Timoney, said
the profile of a criminal in the United States has become black,
Latino or Asian.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about policemen sworn to uphold the law that are
paid by taxpayers but that see criminals based on their race, and
it is tolerated because their race is black,'' said Sharpton. ``If
you had in any city of this country a black mayor, including
Houston, that allowed black police to racially profile whites,
you'd have emergency sessions of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all of us understand to understand the gravity of this,
all you have to do is reverse it. If Lee Brown today in any way
shape or form condoned the racial profiling of whites in Houston,
he'd be impeached.''
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, Timoney said he has stopped giving police
credit for how many people they stop and has begun a more accurate
collection of data. He also banned the use of blackjacks, which led
to complaints that the Mace he substituted didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really,'' Timoney told his officers. ``The blackjacks don't
work either. That's why you're hitting people 10 times. If they
were working, you'd only have to hit them once.''
</P>
<P>
   On the New Jersey Turnpike, said attorney Cochran, who is
representing four young men shot by officers during a random stop,
70 percent of the individuals stopped by police are black but only
17 percent of the drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about `driving while black' but this is more than
that,'' said Cochran, who is also representing Amadou Diallo.
``It's `driving while black and brown and Asian.' It's walking
while black, it's jogging while black, it's shopping while black,
it's living while black.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're targeted based upon your race, that affects
everyone.''

 &HT;    Boone goes from crashing to smashing
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Just when Bret Boone thought his season was crashing
down around him , Tuesday night came along.
</P>
<P>
   On his way to the ballpark for Tuesday's game against the
Astros, Boone's vehicle was the last in a five-car pileup on
Interstate 75. But no one was injured, and his day got
significantly better.
</P>
<P>
   Boone's two-run home run and a two-run double that night brought
the Braves a 6-4 win. Combine that with a double and a homer in his
first two at-bats Wednesday and Boone has found some relief from a
tumultuous offensive season.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting .270 in April and .302 in May, he slumped to a
.178 June, followed by a .217 July. Boone is hitting .251 for the
season, the lowest of the position players in the starting lineup
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Boone, who has begun talks with the Braves about reworking his
contract which extends through 2000 with an option for 2001, said
his future with this team has not affected his poor performance
over the past two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the last thing on my mind,'' Boone said. ``If I can get
back to playing the way I know I'm capable of, that stuff will take
care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Boone has seen both ends of the spectrum, hitting .320 for the
Reds in 1994 and .223 three years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is as hard as I thought it was,'' Boone said. ``It's
a grind, constant work, good years or bad years for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Boone was replaced by Keith Lockhart in the lineup Saturday, but
when Lockhart left the game injured, Boone filled in by going
2-for-5 with a double and two runs scored. After sitting out again
on Monday, he came back with a 2-for-4 night on Tuesday with a
season-high four RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't mad,'' Boone said. ``That had nothing to do with it.
I've just been feeling better lately. I've got less than two months
to finish the year as good as I can, and that's what I plan to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   18 homers and counting
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko could breathe a sigh of relief with home run No. 18
on Tuesday night against the Astros, which equalled his season
total from last year. So what now?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really set goals,'' said Klesko, who's on pace to hit
25 homers, which would be the most he's had since his career-high
34 in 1996. ``My main goal is to have good plate appearances and
help the team get to the playoffs. The last few years I've tried to
do that. If I say I'm going to hit 35 or 40 and then hit 20, I'll
be disappointed. But what if I hit 20 and drive in 100 runs? That's
a pretty good year.''
</P>
<P>
   Battle recalled from Richmond
</P>
<P>
   Harold Battle arrived in Atlanta from AAA Richmond to fill in
until Randall Simon rejoins the team after his mandatory 10 days in
the minor leagues on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's hero, catcher Pascual Matos, was optioned back to
Richmond because Eddie Perez's four-game suspension was over, but
Matos will be back with the team when the roster expands in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Battle won the job by virtue of being Richmond's hottest hitter.
The 27-year-old third baseman was hitting .293 with 21 homers and
66 RBIs in 107 games. He will give Cox a rare right-handed hitter
to use off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third big-league call up for Battle, who spent short
stints up with the Blue Jays in 1995 and the Phillies in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is full of ups and downs,'' Battle said. ``You've
got to stick with it; you never know what can happen. ... I've just
got to take what they give me and make the best of my
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Battle was picked up by the Braves last June as a six-year minor
league free agent the day after he was cut from the White Sox AA
Birmingham team.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   With the off-day today, fifth starter Terry Mulholland will be
skipped in the rotation and make his next start Tuesday in
Colorado. He'll be available in the bullpen otherwise. The rotation
will turn over with Kevin Millwood going on Friday in Los Angeles,
followed by John Smoltz and Tom Glavine.

 &HT;    Woods' bag of majors still light
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ Cruising toward the next century, Tiger Woods
has accomplished everything in 1999 and, well, nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has produced three PGA Tour wins this year, giving him 10
in nearly three full seasons since turning pro in the fall of 1996.
(Twice a trophy was hoisted at the Motorola Western Open at nearby
Cog Hill, if you're looking for a geographical reference this week
at Medinah Country Club).
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Woods has won a European Tour event in Germany;
pushed his career earnings to nearly $7.5 million; dispatched David
Duval in a totally meaningless made-for-TV match; shuttled between
No. 1 and No. 2 in a ratings system sillier than a Beverly
Hillbillies rerun; and managed legitimate contending appearances at
both the U.S. Open and British Open.
</P>
<P>
   Fine accomplishments for anyone else as the 81st PGA
Championship starts today, but Tiger Woods is the fellow who was
supposed to be collecting major championships like others amass
parking tickets. And if you're keeping score at home, 10 majors
have come and gone since the Masters of 1997, the site of Woods'
one and only pro major title.
</P>
<P>
   If you count Woods' three U.S. Amateurs, he has a total of four
majors, but either way, the 23-year-old has not moved as quickly as
was predicted toward Jack Nicklaus' magical 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger's won one major championship,'' said Greg Norman, who
does not include the U.S. Amateurs. ``He's got to win one major
every year for the next 19 years to approach Jack Nicklaus. And
that's a pretty tall order because he (Nicklaus) was a
once-every-10,000 year golfer.''
</P>
<P>
   Even golf's more casual obsevers would realize that Woods fits
well for a PGA Championship situated at a 7,401-yard golf course
with three par-5's unreachable to players with mortal length. Woods
tees off today (at 9:04 a.m. with Tom Watson and Brian Watts) as
the prohibitive favorite at Medinah, a course that rewards a
high-ball trajectory and shaping ability through the 4,200 trees.
</P>
<P>
   While a few of the greens will appear brownish to television
viewers because of heat stress during near-record tempeatures,
maybe Woods' sometimes sporadic putting performances won't be as
visible.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can do is keep giving myself chances,'' Woods said,
``and I've come close in a couple of them this year. I had a good
chance at the U.S. Open (tie for third) and I had another good
chance at the British (tie for seventh). It's just part of the game
to keep giving yourself chances. Eventually, either someone else is
going to make a mistake or I'm going to outplay somebody. . . You
can't win every time you're in the hunt. Unfortunately, we would
like to, but it just doesn't happen that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Most believe the majors will come for Woods, perhaps just not at
the clip Nicklaus implied when saying in 1997 that ``he'll win more
Masters than Arnold Palmer and I combined.'' Woods' greatest impact
to golf thus far has been his ability to raise interest in the game
and push minorities and kids toward what was previously perceived
as an older person's sport. From a pro standpoint, Woods has pushed
his colleagues to higher goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger Woods has made the greatest impression on the tour since
Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer,'' Tom Watson was saying Tuesday.
``Tiger is setting a new standard amongst the players on the tour.
I think they look at the leaderboard and say, `What's Tiger doing?'
I think that increases the competitiveness, increases the way the
game is playedout here.''
</P>
<P>
   With Medinah a long course where the driver returns as a
sensible weapon _ after being holstered so much at the British Open
_ Woods has a chance to separate himself this week at the PGA and
improve on his best finish in the tournament, a tie for 10th last
year at Sahalee. Woods said early in the week that the course, with
the fairways running fast, does not seem overly long. And, as he
understated, ``I'm not short off the tee.''
</P>
<P>
   Medinah is a course where the player who can shape his ball
suffficently, following the treelines with enough length, has an
opporunity to really score. Woods is more talented at that aspect
of his game than ever before..
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy who's going to win this golf tournament has to be able
to shape the ball both ways,'' Woods said, ``not just hit it one
way.''
</P>
<P>
   A ``major'' advantage, perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at Jack's career, and Jack finished second in 19
majors,'' Tiger said. ``How did he feel about that, losing that
many times? But he also won 18 (pro majors). You give yourself
enough chances, and eventually you're going to win a few.

 &HT;    Falcons glad to get Anderson in camp
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _Perhaps Atlanta Falcons defensive end Chuck
Smith summed it up best Wednesday when asked about All-Pro running
back Jamal Anderson signing a new deal, and ending his two-week
holdout from training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great, man,'' Smith said. ``The (Leaning Tower of Pisa)
is going to get straight, Elvis is seen again and Jamal's back at
camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who rushed for an NFC-best 1,846 yards last season,
signed a five-year, $32-million contract, making him one of the
NFL's three-highest paid backs.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was reached after Anderson and his agent, Jim Sims of
Oakland, met with Falcons coach Dan Reeves and general manager
Harold Richardson at a Greenville hotel Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   After the negotiations were done, Anderson went to the team's
camp at Furman University for the first time. Riding in a black,
stretch limousine, Anderson went to the players' dorms about 5:35
p.m., shortly after the team's two-hour practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw him (Wednesday), it was a great sight for sore
eyes,'' linebacker Jessie Tuggle said. ``To get him here now, it's
still early, and I think the days that he missed won't hurt him.
Everybody welcomed him and we're glad to see him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a big smile on his face, and I would have had one, too.
I think he's happy with the deal he got and, more than that, he's
happy just to get it all behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is expected to participate in today's short practice in
Greenville. He may dress out for Friday's preseason game against
Detroit in the Georgia Dome, but won't play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be critical, there's no doubt about it,'' free
safety Eugene Robinson said. ``We don't need him for Detroit. We
need him for Minnesota (in the Sept. 12 season opener in
Atlanta).''
</P>
<P>
   Tuggle says Anderson's teammates are excited to finally get the
distraction behind them. ``It's large,'' Tuggle said. ``Jamal is
definitely such a major part of our offensive football team and the
whole team, entirely. For us to get back to the playoffs and reach
the ultimate level of playing for the NFC Championship again, we
need Jamal in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Aches and pains
</P>
<P>
   Three more Falcons joined the long list of injured players on
Wednesday _ wideout Tim Dwight (sore back), Smith (toe) and tight
end Reggie Kelly (ankle).
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who started all but four of Atlanta's 64 regular-season
games the past four seasons, injured his right big toe on July 29,
the first day of camp. He returned on Monday after missing 14
straight practices, but reaggravated the injury Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is wearing a soft cast and won't play against the Lions.
He could miss as much as a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know long I'll miss,'' he said. ``I can tell you that
I'll be ready for Minnesota.''
</P>
<P>
   Dwight is competing with Ronnie Harris for the deep-threat role
vacated by Tony Martin, who was waived in February and signed by
Miami. Dwight suffered the same ailment in last year's camp.
</P>
<P>
   Harris has been slowed by a groin injury, but practiced on
Wednesday. Calloway missed his fifth straight day and is expected
to be out at least another week with a high ankle sprain.
</P>
<P>
   Other players who missed Wednesday's practice were: tight end
O.J. Santiago (bruised leg), cornerback Michael Booker (quad),
linebacker Ruffin Hamilton (sprained knee), defensive tackle Ben
Huff (sprained foot) and cornerback Elijah Williams (knee).
</P>
<P>
   The good, bad and ugly
</P>
<P>
   The good _ The Anderson deal is done, finally.
</P>
<P>
   The bad _ More injuries to an already-thin receiving corps.
Rookie Eugene Baker of Kent University isn't upset, however. He may
start Friday against the Lions.
</P>
<P>
   The ugly _ The media horde scrambling to find Anderson's meeting
with the Falcons brass.
</P>
<P>
   Surgery for McClure
</P>
<P>
   Rookie center Todd McClure of LSU will undergo surgery today at
Piedmont Hospital to repair a torn anterior cruciate ligament in
his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve defensive end Brett Williams also will have his knee
scoped at Piedmont to remove loose bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Quotes of the day
</P>
<P>
   ``Car chase? What car chase?'' _ Falcons first-year public
relations director Aaron Salkin, upon learning that three of
Atlanta's four TV stations had crews following Reeves and
Richardson from Furman to the Greenville Hilton for their meeting
with Anderson and Sims.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Richardson) has no future in NASCAR if he can't lose me and
(WAGA sports anchor) Karla (Moore) when we're in a Bronco and a
mini-van.'' _ WSB sports anchor Kristy Deere.
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   Backup quarterback Danny Kanell, signed to a two-year deal in
the offseason, may work the majority of the game against the Lions.
Starter Chris Chandler will start. ... Former Georgia linebacker
Whit Marshall will see action at deep snapper Friday, which could
be his best shot at making the club. Marshall is the No. 3
strongside linebacker and is battling Adam Schreiber, Greg Bishop
and Jeff Kelly for the snapping duties.

KELLEHER MAKES CANCER ANNOUNCEMENT WITH USUAL FLAIR
</HEADLINE>
 
(DUPLICATION ALERT: Filed on ``a'' and ``f'' wires) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAN REED 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Herb Kelleher, the charismatic and irreverent architect of
Southwest Airlines' widely envied corporate culture, disclosed
Wednesday that he has begun radiation treatment for prostate
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher, 68, said his doctor found ``a mundane, routine'' case
at ``a relatively early stage of development'' during an annual
exam early last month.
</P>
<P>
   Testing showed that ``other than the prostate cancer, there's
nothing wrong with the rest of me that wasn't wrong when I was
born,'' Kelleher added, with his usual touch of whimsy.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Kelleher's age and his hard-charging lifestyle
have prompted Wall Street analysts and investors to raise questions
about Southwest's succession plans. Kelleher travels relentlessly,
smokes five packs of cigarettes a day and favors Wild Turkey
whiskey.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he is highly regarded as a corporate leader.
Two weeks ago, he was honored by ``Chief Executive'' magazine as
its chief executive of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher dismissed the succession concerns Wednesday and
downplayed the seriousness of his illness, saying the cancer won't
affect his ability to manage the airline.
</P>
<P>
   He said that for the next eight weeks, he plans to be at
Southwest's headquarters at Dallas' Love Field each morning and
early afternoon. He then will fly to Houston for radiation
treatments at the University of Texas' M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with reporters in a telephone news conference
yesterday, he also made clear that he was annoyed by having to
discuss his problem publicly. The disclosure, he said, was to
``dispel the possibility of any ill-founded rumor, conjecture,
speculations or any form of hearsay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I wish it were called the M.D. Anderson Acne Center,
or the M.D. Anderson Hemorrhoid Center, but it's not,'' he said.
``It's the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. ... I went there Monday to
deliver the final results of my tests, and two or three people in
the lobby recognized me. So I figured I needed to say something
publicly.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher said that, although he does not intend to become a
spokesman for the disease, he also went public because, ``as my
doctors say, I'm sort of a poster boy for the value of having
regular examinations.''
</P>
<P>
   Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer among
men. Nearly 180,000 cases are diagnosed each year in the United
States, and about 37,000 men die of it each year. But the cancer is
generally slow-growing, and survival rates are high if it is
diagnosed early.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest, founded in 1971 as an intrastate carrier in Texas
with three airplanes, has a fleet of 300 Boeing 737s and is the
nation's fifth-largest airline in passengers boarded.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement had little effect on Southwest's stock, which
closed at $16.375 a share Wednesday, down 12.5 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher dismissed notions that he might relinquish any of his
three positions _ chairman, president and chief executive officer _
or publicly name a No. 2 executive and heir apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no need to update any succession plan because our
board discusses that issue on a regular basis and has done so for a
good number of years,'' Kelleher said. ``The fact that I'm
undergoing these radiation treatments will have no effect on the
operations of Southwest Airlines whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the company's formal announcement of the illness made
light of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be my guess that our officer group is probably
somewhat disappointed that I will be in my office more than normal
during the treatment period, since ordinarily I travel several days
per week,'' Kelleher said in the release.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the cancer highlights succession concerns that have
arisen among some investors.
</P>
<P>
   In May, a shareholder pushed a proposal requiring Kelleher to
give up one of his three positions. The matter was put on the
agenda for the annual shareholders meeting, but it failed because
its proponent, J. Michael Schaefer, didn't appear at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher mocked the issue at the meeting, lighting a cigarette
with flair when the proposal came up. Cigarette dangling from his
lips, he then spoke at length about his physical condition and the
quality of the airline's management team under him.
</P>
<P>
   He has also argued that the five or six Southwest executives who
are candidates will work harder to prove their mettle because he
has not named a successor.
</P>
<P>
   Julius Maldutis, who follows the industry for CIBC Oppenheimer,
said the succession issue is ``less relevant today than it was 10
years ago'' when Southwest was much smaller and almost a corporate
extension of Kelleher's personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Herb has built an extraordinary airline that is now
self-sustaining and which is really managed by all the employees,''
Maldutis said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Kelleher's unique leadership, Southwest has been
identified as one of the best places to work in America.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher is known for regular visits with employees and for his
willingness to poke fun at himself, donning costumes, imitating
Elvis and joking with passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a great sense of humor, is always upbeat,'' Brad
Fraizer, a Southwest customer service manager, said at Love Field
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Fraizer, who has worked for Southwest for more than six years,
suggested that Kelleher's strong will would help him defeat the
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's going to happen to Herb,'' Fraizer said. ``We don't
even like to think about it. We're all pulling for him.''

   Speaking with reporters in a telephone news conference
yesterday, he also made clear that he was annoyed by having to
discuss his problem publicly. The disclosure, he said, was to
``dispel the possibility of any ill-founded rumor, conjecture,
speculations or any form of hearsay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I wish it were called the M.D. Anderson Acne Center,
or the M.D. Anderson Hemorrhoid Center, but it's not,'' he said.
``It's the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. ... I went there Monday to
deliver the final results of my tests, and two or three people in
the lobby recognized me. So I figured I needed to say something
publicly.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher said that, although he does not intend to become a
spokesman for the disease, he also went public because, ``as my
doctors say, I'm sort of a poster boy for the value of having
regular examinations.''
</P>
<P>
   Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer among
men. Nearly 180,000 cases are diagnosed each year in the United
States, and about 37,000 men die of it each year. But the cancer is
generally slow-growing, and survival rates are high if it is
diagnosed early.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest, founded in 1971 as an intrastate carrier in Texas
with three airplanes, has a fleet of 300 Boeing 737s and is the
nation's fifth-largest airline in passengers boarded.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement had little effect on Southwest's stock, which
closed at $16.375 a share Wednesday, down 12.5 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher dismissed notions that he might relinquish any of his
three positions _ chairman, president and chief executive officer _
or publicly name a No. 2 executive and heir apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no need to update any succession plan because our
board discusses that issue on a regular basis and has done so for a
good number of years,'' Kelleher said. ``The fact that I'm
undergoing these radiation treatments will have no effect on the
operations of Southwest Airlines whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the company's formal announcement of the illness made
light of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be my guess that our officer group is probably
somewhat disappointed that I will be in my office more than normal
during the treatment period, since ordinarily I travel several days
per week,'' Kelleher said in the release.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the cancer highlights succession concerns that have
arisen among some investors.
</P>
<P>
   In May, a shareholder pushed a proposal requiring Kelleher to
give up one of his three positions. The matter was put on the
agenda for the annual shareholders meeting, but it failed because
its proponent, J. Michael Schaefer, didn't appear at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher mocked the issue at the meeting, lighting a cigarette
with flair when the proposal came up. Cigarette dangling from his
lips, he then spoke at length about his physical condition and the
quality of the airline's management team under him.
</P>
<P>
   He has also argued that the five or six Southwest executives who
are candidates will work harder to prove their mettle because he
has not named a successor.
</P>
<P>
   Julius Maldutis, who follows the industry for CIBC Oppenheimer,
said the succession issue is ``less relevant today than it was 10
years ago'' when Southwest was much smaller and almost a corporate
extension of Kelleher's personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Herb has built an extraordinary airline that is now
self-sustaining and which is really managed by all the employees,''
Maldutis said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Kelleher's unique leadership, Southwest has been
identified as one of the best places to work in America.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher is known for regular visits with employees and for his
willingness to poke fun at himself, donning costumes, imitating
Elvis and joking with passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a great sense of humor, is always upbeat,'' Brad
Fraizer, a Southwest customer service manager, said at Love Field
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Fraizer, who has worked for Southwest for more than six years,
suggested that Kelleher's strong will would help him defeat the
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's going to happen to Herb,'' Fraizer said. ``We don't
even like to think about it. We're all pulling for him.''

SUSPECT IN L.A. SHOOTING WAS WELL KNOWN FOR VIOLENT HATE
</HEADLINE>
  (With LA-SHOOTING-RDP, LA-SHOOTING-REACT) 
 (sw) 
 By TIMOTHY EGAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It did not take long for people who had seen the
police mug shot of Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr. when it flashed on a
television screen to remember other, more disturbing images of the
man.
</P>
<P>
   There was the picture, taken four years ago by a Spokane
newspaper, of Furrow in a neo-Nazi uniform, standing guard outside
the north Idaho compound of the Aryan Nations. He had developed a
militant hatred of Jews, blacks and homosexuals who are routinely
compared to spawn of the devil at the headquarters of the small but
persistent group of racists, acquaintances recalled.
</P>
<P>
   There was the confrontation in the forest, when Furrow, with
pistol strapped to his hip, asked a logging crew in northeast
Washington state if there were any blacks among them, according to
people who worked for the timber outfit.
</P>
<P>
   And, perhaps most revealing, Furrow himself told authorities who
questioned him after he was arrested in an assault case last year
that he was a racist who fantasized about committing a mass
killing. In his wallet was a card identifying him as member of the
Aryan Nations, and in his car was a 9 mm handgun and several rounds
of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I feel like I could just lose it and kill people,''
he told police in the Seattle area.
</P>
<P>
   He was a loner with an obsession for guns who thought constantly
about murder and suicide, acquaintances say. But there was another
dimension: a hatred for people different from himself that led him
from the Aryan Nations compound to a small town in Washington
state, where he became involved with the widow of one of the
nation's best known domestic terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   In Metaline Falls, Wash., a broken mining and timber town of
under 300 people, Buford took up residence for nearly two years in
the mid-1990s with Debbie Mathews, the widow of Robert J. Mathews.
Still revered by white supremacists around the country, Mathews
founded a neo-Nazi group called The Order, which carried out a
campaign of assassinations, bombings, and robberies. He died in a
shootout with federal authorities in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow met Ms. Mathews at the Aryan Nations compound. Several
friends said the couple was later married, although there is no
record of the ceremony in civil documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were living together, and I never was sure if they were
married or not,'' said Roger Lynn, manager of a tractor repair
business that employed Furrow as a mechanic for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   After The Order was broken apart by arrests, internal dissent
and killings, some of the more violent racists of the Pacific
Northwest vowed to strike at their targets in small groups, or
acting alone, swearing membership in something known as the Phineas
Priesthood by committing a violent act against Jews, blacks,
homosexuals or abortion providers.
</P>
<P>
   Police would not say on Wednesday whether Furrow was a member of
the group. But in his van on Tuesday, police in Los Angeles found a
book written by Richard Kelly Hoskins, who also wrote a manifesto
on the Phineas Priesthood and numerous other books about race and
banking.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief interview on Wednesday from his home in Lynchburg,
Va., Hoskins said the book found in Furrow's van, ``War
Cycles/Peace Cycles,'' was about ``the history of usury,''
including what he called ``the traditional Jewish presence in
banking.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I don't know what a book of economics has to do with
shooting children at a day care center,'' and then hung up. On his
Web page, Hoskins describes the book as ``the definitive work on
usury'' and writes that it explains ``the necessity for
assassination of national leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   In describing his book on the Phineas Priesthood, Hoskins wrote:
``As the Kamikaze is to the Japanese, as the Shiite is to Islam, as
the Zionist is to the Jew, so the Phineas Priest is to
Christendom.''
</P>
<P>
   After taking a taxi cab across the desert from Los Angeles to
Las Vegas and then turning himself in to the FBI on Wednesday,
Furrow told authorities that the shootings were done as ``a wake-up
call to America to kill Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the people who know Furrow say Jews were particularly
demonized in his mind, in accordance with the religion of Christian
Identity, a philosophy that holds that Jews are subhuman, and the
spawn of the devil.
</P>
<P>
   Groups that research and track hate groups place the total of
Christian Identity followers in the United States at around 35,000
people. ``There are a lot more active followers of Christian
Identity than there are members of the Ku Klux Klan,'' said Morris
Dees, legal director of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which has
filed numerous law suits against racist organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very hard-core Christian Identity,'' said T.J. Leyden,
a former skinhead who is a consultant for the Simon Wiesenthal
Center in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow `` had a violent temper,'' said Meda VanDyke, who
described herself as a 20-year friend of Mrs. Mathews in Metaline
Falls. The couple broke up, she said, because, ``He wanted to
control everything and tell her what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Crawford, the research director for the Coaltion for
Human Dignity, a Northwest group that documents hate groups, said
Mrs. Mathews still has a very high standing among violent white
supremacists. ``She was the wife of the premier martyr for
anti-black, anti-Semite hate groups,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Outside her house in the woods on Wednesday _ posted with three
no trespassing signs _ Mrs. Mathews refused to talk to reporters.
She makes crafts from local products and sells them in town.
</P>
<P>
   Around Metaline Falls, which is tucked in the heavy forests of
Pend Oreille County near the Idaho border, Furrow was ubiquitous in
camouflage outfits in the mid 1990s. The town marshal, Rick Rieber,
said he stopped Furrow once for speeding _ his only known
infraction.
</P>
<P>
   He presented himself as an engineer or a mechanic in various
jobs and on official documents. He commuted 100 miles round-trip
every day from Metaline Falls to a job at LaDuke &AMP; Fogle Equipment
in Colville, a company which sells and repairs tractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed up to work every day, did his job, and never got
involved with any trouble that I knew of,'' said Roger Lynn, the
company manager. ``After he left, I heard he was a neo-Nazi and a
racist. But we never heard any of that while he was here.''
</P>
<P>
   He worked for the company for about a year, in the mid 1990s,
and then was laid off, said Lynn.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Mrs. Mathews, Furrow moved back to western
Washington. Last year, Furrow attempted to stab a woman at a
psychiatric center outside Seattle. In court documents, he
described his rage and fantasies of committing a mass killing. He
showed up at at psychiatric hospital outside Seattle last year,
seeking admission. But he appeared to be drunk, and when hospital
officials tried to take his car keys away, he threatened to stab
one of them, according to court records in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow served 165 days in jail for attempted assault. He was
released in May of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Donahoe, a spokesman for the King County Prosecutor's
Office, said Furrow served a slightly above average sentence for
his crime. As a first-time offender, he could not be expected to
spend more time in jail, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that Furrow's racist background was not grounds for
further charges or prosecutorial investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in a rural community outside Olympia, Wash., Furrow
was known as somewhat overweight, bespectacled boy. ``He was raised
in a good Christian, patriotic family,'' said Bill Wells, an uncle
of Furrow, who lives in West Columbia, S.C. ``We don't support any
white supremacist groups,'' he added. ``We are not a bunch of
bigots or racists.''
</P>
<P>
   Furrow may have tried to present himself at the Aryan Nations
compound as a warrior schooled in the arts of combat, but as a real
soldier in the U.S. Army, he was unsuccessful. Military records
from the Pentagon showed that Furrow lasted only five months in the
Army in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Furrow listed addresses in Lynwood, Wash., at
his parents home outside Olympia, and _ most recently _ in
California. Outside the Furrow family house in Old Nisqually, near
Olympia, neighbors on Wednesday recalled a mostly benign man prone
to occasional grandiose acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stopped traffic outside my driveway once to help my wife
get the mail,'' said Tim Tyrolt, whol lives next to the Furrows.
``They are regular, quiet neighbors.''

 TORNADO DAMAGES DOWNTOWN SALT LAKE CITY  (mk) 
 By ANTHONY RAMIREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A rare tornado struck downtown Salt Lake City without warning
Wednesday, churning through the area around the Mormon Church's
historic Salt Lake Temple as pedestrians were crowding the streets
for the lunch hour.
</P>
<P>
   At least one person was killed and more than 40 were injured, at
least 12 critically.
</P>
<P>
   Winds of up to 160 mph blew through the city's central district.
A black funnel cloud touched down on the Delta Center sports
complex, where the Utah Jazz basketball team plays, blew out the
windows of the Wyndham Hotel, ripped apart a huge outdoor tent that
had been pitched for a retailers' convention, and then smashed
roofs of houses north of downtown before dissipating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was lunch hour, it's just a miracle more people weren't
killed and injured,'' said Sgt. Kenneth Hansen, a spokesman for the
Salt Lake City Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen said the retailers' convention, which was expected to
attract 25,000, was scheduled to open Thursday. Had it already been
under way, the tent in the parking lot behind the Salt Palace
Convention Center would have been crowded with conventioneers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would have been a disaster,'' Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
   The name of the dead person was not immediately available. The
most seriously injured were taken to Salt Lake Regional Hospital,
University of Utah Medical Center and Latter-day Saints Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. William Brass, a spokesman for the Salt Lake County Fire
Department, said, ``This caught us by surprise. We get dust devils
and it gets a little windy, that's usually all. But this was no
dust devil.''
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City last had a tornado in 1968, Brass said.
</P>
<P>
   Tornadoes are rare in Utah, which had 32 in 25 years, said Tim
Shy, a researcher at the University of Illinois at
Champaign-Urbana. Over the same 25 years, Oklahoma had 1,326.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Burch, lead forecaster with the Salt Lake City office of
the National Weather Service, said the tornado was detected about
12:45 p.m. Mountain time, but the weather service's radar, about 40
miles from downtown, indicated only a severe thunderstorm.
</P>
<P>
   At 12:48 p.m. the weather service issued a warning of
``damaging'' winds in excess of 60 mph and large hail of up to
three-quarters of an inch in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It showed no tornadic signature,'' meaning rapid changes in
wind velocity, Burch said.
</P>
<P>
   The weather service estimated that the tornado left a ``damage
track'' as wide as a half-mile and as long as two miles. It touched
ground for at least five minutes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Sears, general manager of the Peery Hotel downtown, said
the tornado ``was humongous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This circular cloud was right on the ground, and I could just
see big chunks of metal that were folding like cardboard,'' Sears
said. ``I walked up one block to some other hotels to see if they
were OK, and there were bricks missing out of the sides of
buildings. But then there were cars still in the parking lots right
next to them, with some of the bricks in the front seats. There was
broken glass everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   John Dwan, a spokesman for the University of Utah hospital, said
he saw the tornado when he was driving not far from downtown. ``I
looked out over the valley, and I thought those are some of the
biggest thunderstorms I've ever seen around here,'' Dwan said. ``I
saw the clouds making these swirling motions, and explosions, and I
thought, `My God, that looks like a tornado, but it can't be
because we don't have tornadoes here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hansen reported some looting of automobiles shortly after the
tornado.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got officers going out to The Avenues,'' a residential
district north of downtown, he said, ``because we've got reports of
at least six rooftops ripped off houses.''

CAR OWNERS' DESIRES DRIVE SURVEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Economics may dictate that we drive Fords, Chevys
and Bugs. But in our hearts we lust after cars with more exotic
pedigrees like BMWs, Mercedes-Benzes and Volvos.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's the conclusion of the Automobile Club of
Southern California's annual ``Target Car Report,'' which
identifies the cars consumers consider to be ideal vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out it's a case of our dreams being bigger than our bank
accounts. But that's typical of the study, which the Auto Club has
been conducting for about 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of the features people want are usually only
found in the more expensive cars,'' said Auto Club spokesman Carol
Thorp.
</P>
<P>
   So a couple of years ago, the Auto Club began listing cars that
offered the best value for the lowest price. Foreign nameplates
dominate there, too.
</P>
<P>
   That's also the case for pickup trucks, that All-American macho
statement of personal conveyance. The highest-ranked truck was the
Mazda B 400 SE Cab Plus 4 4x2. The price, as tested, was $21,484.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's a car or truck, though, consumers are looking for
the same kinds of essentials. The most important features are
braking capability, crash worthiness, visibility, handling and ride
quality.
</P>
<P>
   The survey is conducted every 5 years, which means information
for the car evaluation was collected four years ago. The truck
survey portion was done in late 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Auto Club takes the features consumers rate as the most
important and each year goes out and finds the cars and trucks that
have them.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, though, because these are not stale opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current features in cars have not changed much in the last
10 to 15 years. Consumers tend to look for the same things,'' Thorp
said.
</P>
<P>
   She also noted this is the first year that the top six vehicles
in each category have emissions below California's basic clean air
standard.
</P>
<P>
   The report covers 200 models and is available to the general
public for $7.50 and $6 for club members.

FLOWERS BE COME STAPLE OF ADVENTUROUS EATING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JAIMEE ROSE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Go ahead. Eat the daisies.
</P>
<P>
   Violets, while you're at it. Roses, nasturtiums, scented
geraniums.
</P>
<P>
   Graze that garden with reckless abandon! Munch the marigolds!
Devour the dandelions! Taste the tulips!
</P>
<P>
   Because yes, they're all edible.
</P>
<P>
   Although the idea of downing blooms seems novel, it has actually
been around for eons. (What do you think the artichoke is?)
</P>
<P>
   However, somewhere between the '90s resurgence of adventurous
eating and Martha Stewart's declaration that eating flowers is a
``good thing,'' edible blooms have become quite the haute little
item.
</P>
<P>
   Proof: The Savoy hotel in London (think Ritz and glitz) just
announced that it is serving summer cocktails flavored with
flowers. The Gourmet Garage in New York City (think chef central)
has increased its palatable petal offerings to 10 types from four.
</P>
<P>
   The little lovelies have even arrived at the average consumer's
grocery store, and not just at foodie outposts.
</P>
<P>
   And now the question we know you're asking: So, how do they
taste?
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, good.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them are sweet, such as elderberry; others minty, such
as Johnny-jump-up; a few are bitter, such as the English daisy.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, you've probably already tried some. The conventional
recipe for Chinese hot and sour soup calls for daylily petals.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers are ubiquitous in other cuisines, too. Indian cuisine is
highly reliant on rosewater, and English Victorians made tea
sandwiches out of the pretty blooms. In France's Provence region,
chefs are crazy for zucchini blooms, stuffing them with cheese or
making them into soups. And Asian jasmine tea is brewed straight
from jasmine blooms.
</P>
<P>
   They're easy to incorporate into cooking and are basically
fat-free. (We're not sure which food group they're in . . . fruits
and veggies, anyone?)
</P>
<P>
   Try tossing a few violets or pansies into a fruit salad. (But
know that dark pansies can temporarily color the tongue.) Harvest
some squash blossoms, batter and fry. Tastes just like fried
zucchini. Finely chop a half-cup of flowers and blend into a
half-pound of butter. After a few hours in the fridge, you've got a
sweet-smelling spread. Tuck goat cheese, some fresh herbs, and a
prawn into a zucchini bloom, fry it until the shrimp is pink, and
you've got a wowser of an appetizer.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Wilkinson Barash, author of eight cookbooks, most notably
``Edible Flowers _ Desserts &AMP; Drinks,'' the edible bloom bible, is
a big flower-eating fan.
</P>
<P>
   Barash, who lives in Iowa, starting eating blooms when she was a
child.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents saw me and freaked out,'' she says, ``so (writing
flower cookbooks) was the ultimate nyah nyah nyah.''
</P>
<P>
   She recommends a little underhandedness for turning tepid
tongues on to edible flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you sneak a flower to them, if it's chopped up and in
something, they're like `Oh! Not bad!' '' she says.
</P>
<P>
   And once you try them, Barash says, you're hooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I positively go through withdrawal in the wintertime,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   In season, she eats them 60 percent of the time: as snacks, main
meals, dessert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I graze in my garden,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   To try a flower, which Barash says is a must before including it
in cuisine, she recommends something like a wine-tasting:
</P>
<P>
   ``Each has a different flavor,'' she says. ``So, I take a little
bite, chew it with my front teeth, and if I like it, I let the
flavors roll over my tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if I still like it, I swallow. If I don't, I spit it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other rules to eating flowers, too. First of all, be
absolutely sure they are edible. (We've included a list of the most
popular varieties.) And make sure you've got the right version.
Arabian jasmine, for example, is OK. But Carolina jasmine and
jessamine are poisonous.
</P>
<P>
   Being edible also means being organic. Do not eat blooms that
aren't pesticide-free; this includes boycotting flowers from
florists.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure edibility, grow your own or buy flowers that are
specified as edible, such as the packets at Fry's. They're also
available through mail-order companies such as Martha Stewart's
Martha By Mail. Call 1-800-950-7130 for a catalog or visit
www.marthabymail.com on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Barash says, be sure to eat only the parts of the flowers
that are edible. No stamens, pistils or styles. When cooking with
roses, cut off the little white base that joins the petal to the
core. Cook only with the petals.
</P>
<P>
   Another rule of flower-eating is in harvesting. Barash says it's
best to pick them in the morning when they're fresh; flowers not
yet open or worse, wilted, should be left on the stem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of them as fruit,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Edible flowers also make for a great garnish. Untouched, they
add color and whimsy to the plate. When crystallized, basically
coated with egg whites and sugar, they make delicate, delicious
cake decorations and can last for up to a year.
</P>
<P>
   But if they're on the plate, Barash says, ``they better be
edible, otherwise, put 'em in the vase.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally, have fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flowers are happy food,'' Barash says. ``They make people
smile.'' &QL;

CRENSHAW CITES RIFT WITHIN US RYDER CUP TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ The cease-fire lasted less than 24 hours. And by
the time the battle was rejoined, the combatants had changed. No
longer are the PGA Tour and the PGA of America at odds over the
distribution of Ryder Cup revenues. Now the rift is within the
Ryder Cup team itself.
</P>
<P>
   US captain Ben Crenshaw Wednesday shattered the air of
tranquility that had hovered over Chicagoland since Tuesday
afternoon by unleashing an unsolicited thunderbolt during what had
been a routine press conference on the eve of the PGA Championship
at Medinah Country Club. He would not specify his targets during
the public forum, but in the players' locker room early last
evening, he told the Globe that his displeasure is directed
specifically at Mark O'Meara, Tiger Woods, and David Duval, who are
guaranteed spots on the 12-man US team that will face Europe Sept.
24-26 in Brookline, Mass., plus Phil Mickelson, who is on the
bubble.
</P>
<P>
   Their transgression, in Crenshaw's view: Raising and
perpetuating complaints that the PGA Tour, which provides the Ryder
Cuppers, lacks input into how the profits are appropriated by the
PGA of America, which runs the Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an affront to all those who came before them,'' said
Crenshaw. ``The timing is not good.'' His hands framed a tight
route along a narrow green carpet in the middle of the locker room.
``I want all the players on the same road _ to Brookline. I'm
concerned about their focus.''
</P>
<P>
   A day after the PGA of America had assured 16 Ryder candidates
that the Tour would have greater say as to which charities benefit
from the profits of more than $20 million the matches are expected
to generate, the truce proved illusory. Crenshaw was asked about
Tuesday's summit that had taken place in a second-floor room of the
Medinah clubhouse, which both PGA of America CEO Jim Awtrey and PGA
Tour commissioner Tim Finchem characterized as a breakthrough for
goodwill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it was a good meeting,'' Crenshaw said before proceeding
to blast away. ``I want to say one thing. I'm personally
disappointed in a couple people in that meeting. I mean that. And
they know who they are. And whether some players like it or not,
there are some people who came before them that mean a hell of a
lot to this game. And it burns the hell out of me to listen to some
of their viewpoints. And I'm not going to say any more about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But he did _ plenty. The man nicknamed Gentle Ben because of his
placid demeanor clearly was infuriated that a peripheral issue had
become a crisis with the Cup _ which the United States has lost in
the last two biennial meetings _ on the immediate horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't show up and play for your country, if that's not
reward enough,'' Crenshaw said during the impromptu press
conference that convened after his bombshell, ``then my heart
bleeds.''
</P>
<P>
   While the media speculated about who had rendered Crenshaw
ballistic, it turned out that the ``couple'' he referred to was in
fact a quartet. Woods, Duval, Mickelson, and O'Meara had left the
course by the time Crenshaw unloaded, but it's doubtful they'll be
surprised by the volley, only that it became public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let all these players know how I feel before the meeting,''
he said in the locker room. ``And I said it again in front of
everyone at the meeting. Jim and Tim asked everyone to give their
viewpoints, and I was kind of off in a corner listening. Maybe I'm
overreacting to it, but I'm from a different generation. To me,
it's an honor to play for your country _ it's a duty.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara, Duval, and Woods are the usual suspects in this seamy
sideshow. All at least have been forthright enough to voice their
displeasure _ usually at the media's prodding _ with what they
consider the PGA of America's lack of accountability regarding
Ryder revenue. They claim that many fellow touring pros share their
sentiments, but Mickelson was a surprising ally. Like Crenshaw a
traditionalist, he seemingly has expressed nothing but reverence
for the Ryder Cup and its history.
</P>
<P>
   Apprised of this observation, Crenshaw shook his head and said,
``I question his . . .''
</P>
<P>
   He let that thought dangle but emphatically added, ``I want him
on the team. I really want him on the team. He's such a talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw made it clear that he does not oppose the players'
stance, only the timing and vigor of it. But more than anything,
it's the precedent that bothers him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried about six or eight years down the road,'' he said.
``I want the Ryder Cup to be on the same pedestal it is now. Three
or four Cups from now, will there be something else?''
</P>
<P>
   The present is enough to gnaw at Crenshaw. While he acknowledged
that occasionally during PGA week, the PGA of America and Ryder
Cuppers have met, the tenor of this gathering galled him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost four hours of sleep last night thinking about it,'' he
said. ``Not just the viewpoints but the meeting itself.''
</P>
<P>
   But he echoed the pronouncements of Awtrey and Finchem that it
had been a productive session from which everyone departed ``on the
same page.'' Given that, he was asked in the hindsight of the
clubhouse some 90 minutes after his unprovoked outburst, did he
regret reviving an issue that had seemed resolved?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said Crenshaw. ``I had to get it off my chest.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is unknown how the team will react to its captain's
public display of wrath, Crenshaw can count on at least one
sideline supporter. ``To me, this whole money issue is
embarrassing,'' said Brad Faxon, the former Ryder Cupper from
Barrington, R.I. ``You got four guys who don't want to play Ryder
Cup? Fine. I've got four guys who'll play for nothing _ and
probably play better.''

NEED SURGERY? CALL ROBODOC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JODIE SNYDER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Clad only in a sterile sheet and a cloud of
anesthesia, the patient waits for the surgeon to approach and make
the first cut.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, more and more Valley surgeons can operate
without coming anywhere near.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they can sit at computer terminals, 50 feet or a
battlefield away from their patients, and direct their helpers to
wield the scalpels and sutures.
</P>
<P>
   Helpers made of metal and plastic, bearing names like Zeus and
Hermes.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix area surgeons already are using voice-activated robots
to take pictures inside patients' bodies or to control other pieces
of equipment.
</P>
<P>
   And some say this robotic revolution, which can enhance
precision in operations, free up nurses and enable surgeons to
perform long-distance operations, is just in its early stages.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent operation, Dr. Harold Haston told Aesop 3000, a
relatively simple-minded helper, to zoom in on that morning's
target: a coin-purse-size gallbladder lodged underneath the liver.
</P>
<P>
   Aesop, a black, armlike structure, stood at Haston's side. The
device has a laproscope, a 12- to 15-inch tube with a camera,
that's inserted into patients through an abdominal incision the
size of a finger tip.
</P>
<P>
   Once inserted, the camera sends back images magnified up to 15
times to a screen slightly above Haston's eye level.
</P>
<P>
   With the camera in the patient's stomach, Haston operated other
tools like joysticks as he cleared away tissue from the gallbladder
and then clipped off the blood supply to the organ.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aesop?'' Haston asked as he looked up at the monitor. The
machine beeped back obediently as Haston put it through its paces.
``Move back. Move left. Stop.'' Images of the patient's interior
changed quickly on the screen above Haston's head.
</P>
<P>
   Aesop, which has a vocabulary of 22 words, responds only to
Haston's vocal commands. The surgeon recorded his voice in
different intonations so Aesop would recognize his commands whether
Haston is stressed or relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   It's a vast improvement over the first robot made by Aesop's
creator, the California firm Computer Motion. A surgeon had to
control that device with foot pedals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk about difficult!'' Haston said. ``It's real easy to know
why that went by the wayside.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five minutes after the surgery began at Walter O. Boswell
Memorial Hospital, with the gallbladder cut and pulled through the
small insertion, Aesop was rolled over to the corner and the
patient rolled to the recovery room.
</P>
<P>
   The morning's gallbladder operation is typical of the surgeries
using Aesop: minimally invasive procedures in which surgeons make
small incisions and use tubes to send in equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The result? Patients report less pain and quicker recovery
times.
</P>
<P>
   For his gallbladder procedures, Dr. Corey Detlefs at Good
Samaritan Regional Medical Center uses Hermes, Aesop's more
advanced cousin. With a 90-word vocabulary, Hermes allows Detlefs
to control the camera and other operating room equipment, such as
the lights or a device used to blow carbon dioxide into a patient's
body.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means not tying up the nurse with these details,'' Detlefs
said. ``They've got patient care responsibilities, and it doesn't
take away from anything in the O.R.''
</P>
<P>
   After Aesop and Hermes, there's Zeus, which has three ``arms,''
one to hold the camera and the other two to manipulate instruments
while a surgeon directs from a console.
</P>
<P>
   Zeus has been tried on only a few patients in the United States
and Europe. Since December, it has been used in a dozen
experimental heart bypass operations, said Holley Malia of Computer
Motion.
</P>
<P>
   She said the company expects it to be approved for general use
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by the first half of next
year.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more than just the Greek trio of Aesop, Hermes and
Zeus. Another California company, Vista Medical Technologies, has
created a ``helmet'' for surgeons that takes the interior picture
and projects it onto two tiny display screens, one for each eye.
</P>
<P>
   There's Robodoc, a robot made by Integrated Surgical Systems of
California, which drills bones for hip and knee replacements.
</P>
<P>
   That could mean greater precision in a type of surgery that
takes a lot of drilling and hammering, said Dr. Stuart Williams, a
surgery professor at the University of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way it is now, I call it Black and Decker surgery,''
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Robots are already used to place drugs precisely into brain
tumors, Williams said. Eye surgeons rely on computer assistance to
correct people's visions.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean surgeons are rushing to add robots to their
surgical teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surgeons are an extremely conservative group,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   They could be reluctant to use a robotic middleman instead of
their own hands.
</P>
<P>
   But the use of robots may parallel the development of
laproscopic surgery, a practice that initially drew fire as
``Nintendo surgery''.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very reluctant, and they had to be shown that it
improved patient outcomes and it had an acceptable rate of
precision,'' Williams said. ``Then, it caught on like wildfire.''
</P>
<P>
   Haston said he believes his colleagues will grow to appreciate
the robots' advantages, including more precision.
</P>
<P>
   He conceded that it takes practice to operate on a body without
directly looking at it.
</P>
<P>
   And there's always the lurking concern about technology. Could
Aesop go bad?
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lyttle of Computer Motion said Aesop is programmed to
never exert more than 7 pounds of pressure; so, if it runs into an
organ or bumps into something else, it stops moving. There's a
software device that constantly monitors the arm's action, and
there are manual shut-off devices, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns aside, Haston and others believe the robots' real
advantages is to take the operating room beyond hospital walls.
With satellite networks, the systems could be developed to ``beam
in'' surgeons to rural parts of the country or into battlefields.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the tip of the iceberg,'' Haston said. ``This is
the future.'' &QL;

$140   MILLION IN LOCAL PROJECTS FACE A VETO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Setting up his first showdown with lawmakers since his
election, Governor Paul Cellucci will wield his veto pen to slash
$140 million in ``excessive'' local projects around the state,
sources say.
</P>
<P>
   One week after the House and Senate approved more than $1
billion in road, bridge, and other construction programs, the
governor vowed to ``impose fiscal discipline'' on a Legislature
flush with cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at what we can afford,'' the governor said
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   By evening, budget sources say, Cellucci had targeted $140
million in cuts, including $50 million in transportation projects
and $14 million to build two University of Massachusetts student
centers _ one in Lowell for $4 million and another in Boston for
$10 million _ that would operate on student user fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration has a longstanding opposition to raising
fees of any type,'' said one person familiar with the vetoes.
``Couple that with our commitment to reduce costs at our state
universities, (and) this was a no-brainer.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor is also set to announce Thursday that he will veto
other capital improvements to state facilities, public parks,
Metropolitan District Commission skating rinks, pools, and dams,
because Cellucci would rather borrow to pay for those projects than
use cash, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be close to zero, no money in the bank,'' if the cuts
were not made, one budget source said.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci also plans to axe a $15 million survey of state office
buildings to determine their condition and value. ``We're vetoing
$12.7 million of that,'' one Cellucci aide fumed. ``They don't need
$15 million for a survey.''
</P>
<P>
   To offset his veto of $50 million for local road and bridge
programs, Cellucci is expected to announce that cities and towns
will more than recoup that loss through an unexpected windfall: $85
million in Lottery profits that are automatically distributed as
local aid, on top of the $600 million in fiscal 1999 gambling
proceeds already slotted for municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's going to take a little bit of the sting out,
because it's free cash,'' the source added. The administration
routinely lowballs lottery revenue figures in the state budget.
</P>
<P>
   While last year's budget surplus was used for a one-time
election-year tax cut, returning hundreds of dollars to each
taxpayer, this year's extra cash, estimated between $500 million
and $600 million, is being thrown at one-time capital projects.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, one administration source said, is that lawmakers,
confident from the surging economy and record revenues, are
spending money the state does not have.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we did all of this, it would break the bank,'' said one
budget aide.
</P>
<P>
   Under Cellucci's plan, the state could have a cushion of $80
million to $100 million left in the surplus fund when the fiscal
1999 books are finally closed in October.
</P>
<P>
   Eight days ago, just before Cellucci left for a meeting of the
National Governors Association, lawmakers dusted off plans for
projects he vetoed last year during the gubernatorial campaign and
packaged them with millions of dollars worth of other capital
plans.
</P>
<P>
   The result was two huge spending bills. One, known as the
capital supplement, would use the budget surplus for $609 million
in one-time spending on everything from highway repairs to
purchasing land for a courthouse parking lot in Ayer.
</P>
<P>
   The other, known as the transportation bond bill, would have the
state borrow $616 million for more road and bridge work. This
legislation includes authorization for the Route 3 expansion
project, but does not appropriate money for it.
</P>
<P>
   Those familiar with the veto plan say Cellucci will trim about
$90 million from the capital supplement and another $50 million
from the transportation package, specifically money that goes to
cities and towns for local road and bridge aid.
</P>
<P>
   However, lawmakers seem so intent on getting projects for their
own districts, in addition to the statewide infrastructure work,
that there may not be enough support for the governor to win the
veto game, as he did last year when he cut such things as library
upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature could not override those vetoes at the end of
the session because they ran out of time and adjourned.
</P>
<P>
   During his bid for the GOP nomination, Cellucci successfully
vetoed spending for library construction _ among other things _
saying he wanted the Legislature to approve his own funding plan
for such buildings. Both the House and Senate have snubbed that
request and included the library money in the capital supplement.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci has now given in and agreed to sign off on $45 million
for improving 22 libraries, including $15 million for the Boston
Public Library.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's no surprise the governor supports much of the rest
of the capital supplement plan. He recommended about $400 milion of
it, but vowed to veto nearly all of the spending added by the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   What is surprising is the size of the capital supplement
legislation. Originally, the House called for a $242 million
supplement package; the Senate, a $475 million one. But when both
chambers sat down to compromise, they came up with the $609 million
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Widmer _ executive director of the Massachusetts
Taxpayers Foundation, a fiscal watchdog group _ said the way in
which legislative leaders arrived at the capital supplement does
not bode well for the rest of the state budget, which is overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody got what they wanted and more,'' Widmer said.
``There's some brand new items that were in neither (the House nor
Senate) capital supplement. And in some cases there were higher
numbers than either branch put forth. And in few or no cases did
the lower number prevail for any of the accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's why the state budget, which was supposed to be
approved by the end of the fiscal year on June 30, is still caught
up in compromise negotiations between the chambers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with the fiscal 2000 budget is that both (House
and Senate) budgets are very tightly balanced, and that means that
the only way to produce a final budget is to make some significant
compromise,'' Widmer said. ``So their task is much more
difficult.''

SOME SEE SCOUT RETREAT IN GAY POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Call it the junior version of the military's ``don't
ask, don't tell'' policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Narragansett (R.I.) Council of the Boy Scouts of America,
which has about 20,000 Scouts, issued a statement Wednesday
clarifying its stand on homosexuality in the wake of a recent
episode involving a 16-year-old Eagle Scout who, when asked, said
he was gay.
</P>
<P>
   Although the council said in its statement that it did not
accept ``known or avowed homosexuals'' as Scouts or leaders and
that it saw homosexuality as inconsistent with the Scout oath to be
morally straight, it also said that as a matter of policy, it did
not inquire about sexual orientation. And in the case at issue, the
gay teen-ager has been allowed to remain a Scout.
</P>
<P>
   Some gay and civil rights advocates said the ``don't ask''
policy seemed to mark a certain retreat by the Narragansett Council
from the national Scouts' anti-gay position.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding was that gays were not allowed in the Boy
Scouts, but what they now seem to be saying is that they have a
`don't ask, don't tell' policy, which is different,'' said Steven
Brown, executive director of the Rhode Island chapter of the
American Civil Liberties Union. ``What has happened in this case is
that a gay teen-ager has been allowed to remain in the Boy Scouts.
And the Boy Scouts know he's gay.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman at the Boy Scouts' national headquarters, in Irving,
Texas, referred all questions about the matter to the Narragansett
Council, The Associated Press reported. There, Peter Reid, a
volunteer acting as spokesman, said that he did not believe the
policy was new, that it did not diverge from the policy of the
national headquarters and that the statement had been written in
conjunction with headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, others saw something new, and suggested that it might
have stemmed in part from the New Jersey Supreme Court ruling last
week that struck down the state Boy Scouts' ban on homosexuals. The
Scouts' national headquarters plans to appeal that ruling to the
U.S. Supreme Court, but in the ranks, members say, opinions on the
issue vary.

KELLEHER MAKES CANCER ANNOUNCEMENT WITH USUAL FLAIR

<TEXT>
<P>
   Herb Kelleher, the charismatic and irreverent architect of
Southwest Airlines' widely envied corporate culture, disclosed
Wednesday that he has begun radiation treatment for prostate
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher, 68, said his doctor found ``a mundane, routine'' case
at ``a relatively early stage of development'' during an annual
exam early last month.
</P>
<P>
   Testing showed that ``other than the prostate cancer, there's
nothing wrong with the rest of me that wasn't wrong when I was
born,'' Kelleher added, with his usual touch of whimsy.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Kelleher's age and his hard-charging lifestyle
have prompted Wall Street analysts and investors to raise questions
about Southwest's succession plans. Kelleher travels relentlessly,
smokes five packs of cigarettes a day and favors Wild Turkey
whiskey.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he is highly regarded as a corporate leader.
Two weeks ago, he was honored by ``Chief Executive'' magazine as
its chief executive of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher dismissed the succession concerns Wednesday and
downplayed the seriousness of his illness, saying the cancer won't
affect his ability to manage the airline.
</P>
<P>
   He said that for the next eight weeks, he plans to be at
Southwest's headquarters at Dallas' Love Field each morning and
early afternoon. He then will fly to Houston for radiation
treatments at the University of Texas' M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with reporters in a telephone news conference
Wednesday, he also made clear that he was annoyed by having to
discuss his problem publicly. The disclosure, he said, was to
``dispel the possibility of any ill-founded rumor, conjecture,
speculations or any form of hearsay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I wish it were called the M.D. Anderson Acne Center,
or the M.D. Anderson Hemorrhoid Center, but it's not,'' he said.
``It's the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. ... I went there Monday to
deliver the final results of my tests, and two or three people in
the lobby recognized me. So I figured I needed to say something
publicly.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher said that, although he does not intend to become a
spokesman for the disease, he also went public because, ``as my
doctors say, I'm sort of a poster boy for the value of having
regular examinations.''
</P>
<P>
   Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer among
men. Nearly 180,000 cases are diagnosed each year in the United
States, and about 37,000 men die of it each year. But the cancer is
generally slow-growing, and survival rates are high if it is
diagnosed early.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest, founded in 1971 as an intrastate carrier in Texas
with three airplanes, has a fleet of 300 Boeing 737s and is the
nation's fifth-largest airline in passengers boarded.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement had little effect on Southwest's stock, which
closed at $16.375 a share Wednesday, down 12.5 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher dismissed notions that he might relinquish any of his
three positions _ chairman, president and chief executive officer _
or publicly name a No. 2 executive and heir apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no need to update any succession plan because our
board discusses that issue on a regular basis and has done so for a
good number of years,'' Kelleher said. ``The fact that I'm
undergoing these radiation treatments will have no effect on the
operations of Southwest Airlines whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the company's formal announcement of the illness made
light of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be my guess that our officer group is probably
somewhat disappointed that I will be in my office more than normal
during the treatment period, since ordinarily I travel several days
per week,'' Kelleher said in the release.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the cancer highlights succession concerns that have
arisen among some investors.
</P>
<P>
   In May, a shareholder pushed a proposal requiring Kelleher to
give up one of his three positions. The matter was put on the
agenda for the annual shareholders meeting, but it failed because
its proponent, J. Michael Schaefer, didn't appear at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher mocked the issue at the meeting, lighting a cigarette
with flair when the proposal came up. Cigarette dangling from his
lips, he then spoke at length about his physical condition and the
quality of the airline's management team under him.
</P>
<P>
   He has also argued that the five or six Southwest executives who
are candidates will work harder to prove their mettle because he
has not named a successor.
</P>
<P>
   Julius Maldutis, who follows the industry for CIBC Oppenheimer,
said the succession issue is ``less relevant today than it was 10
years ago'' when Southwest was much smaller and almost a corporate
extension of Kelleher's personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Herb has built an extraordinary airline that is now
self-sustaining and which is really managed by all the employees,''
Maldutis said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Kelleher's unique leadership, Southwest has been
identified as one of the best places to work in America.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher is known for regular visits with employees and for his
willingness to poke fun at himself, donning costumes, imitating
Elvis and joking with passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a great sense of humor, is always upbeat,'' Brad
Fraizer, a Southwest customer service manager, said at Love Field
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fraizer, who has worked for Southwest for more than six years,
suggested that Kelleher's strong will would help him defeat the
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's going to happen to Herb,'' Fraizer said. ``We don't
even like to think about it. We're all pulling for him.''

WORKING POOR PAID NO NOTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The game of pretend echoes from Washington, D.C., to
the Copper Dome on West Washington Street. For days, the subject
has been welfare reform. The politicians' response has been the
usual.
</P>
<P>
   Not a ``handout,'' or a cliched ``hand up,'' but their own hands
reaching around to pat themselves on the back.
</P>
<P>
   The elected ones have been pretending they've solved the problem
of moving from the dole to work. And, fawning as ever, those of us
who fill newspapers have been pretending we care.
</P>
<P>
   This puffery culminated last week in another Bill Clinton
``national forum,'' a Chicago photo op concerning ``welfare to
work.'' The message: We've won.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six and a half years ago,'' Clinton said, ``I asked the
American people to join me on a crusade to transform our system of
welfare into a system of work, to transform a system of dependence
into a system of independence, to prove poor people could succeed.
. . . Now, you see the signs of transformation everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Except in the lives of people like Kathy Tenorio.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy is 38 and a single mother of four daughters, a woman who
spends hours each week carving through red tape at the Department
of Economic Security office at Seventh Avenue and Indian School
Road.
</P>
<P>
   She does this not because she wants to live the Clinton dream
and move from welfare to work, but because, for Kathy Tenorio,
welfare is work.
</P>
<P>
   She works for the DES as a ``Clerk III,'' which means she spends
40 hours a week processing incoming benefits applications, in
return for $9.60 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Which also means Kathy's not merely a DES employee _ she's a
client, too.
</P>
<P>
   After five years with the state, her $19,968-a-year salary still
leaves her eligible for, and desperately in need of, $159 a month
in food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   While the politicians boast of people moving from welfare to
work, no one mentions those like Kathy, who've moved from work to
welfare to poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, the only way I can work this out is if I can skip a
payment here or there,'' she says. ``One of my daughters, she needs
glasses. We had to put that off for the summer, until school
starts. . . . It's really a lot of hard work; then you see your
paycheck. I love my job, but it's so disappointing.'' &QL; 
(at)j  &QL; 
A living wage
</P>
<P>
   (at)j  &QL; 
And not for her alone. David Medina, a lobbyist for the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, estimates
there may be as many as 2,000 Kathys among the state's 30,000
workers.
</P>
<P>
   His answer?
</P>
<P>
   ``A minimum wage (for state workers) of 10 bucks an hour. Then,
everything else would have to be pushed up, obviously. At least
you're in the ballpark then.''
</P>
<P>
   The ballpark being a state wage scale competitive with the rest
of America. While our Legislature has bumped up state employees'
salaries three years running, a 1998 survey still puts Arizona 22
percent behind the market rate.
</P>
<P>
   This deficit exists despite Arizona's legendary economic boom,
its nine-digit budget surplus, and a 1998 bill, passed by the 90
Dwarfs, that not only requires competitive salaries by fiscal 2002,
but also ``realizes the value of state employees.'' &QL; 
(at)j  &QL; 
A mom's bottom line
</P>
<P>
   (at)j  &QL; 
To see the pretend in that quote, you need only look at the bottom
line on Kathy Tenorio's pay stub _ $654.93 every two weeks, after
taxes and insurance, for eight hours a day of her life.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the time she spends explaining to her girls what
they can't have, what they can afford, and how she plans to find a
foothold to crawl up to merely getting by. She tried moonlighting
nights at a Chinese food place, but the baby-sitter's pay killed
her. The only alternative seems to be the food stamp card.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard, but I'm trying to be tough, trying to hang in
there,'' Kathy says. ``Maybe I should go next door and buy a
lottery ticket, huh? You never know.''
</P>
<P>
   But you do, at least a little. You know what it means to watch a
woman stare down reality, while pretenders far and near make
believe she doesn't exist. &QL;

   SRINAGAR, Kashmir _ Sadly, alarmingly, endlessly, there is
trouble in paradise. The Vale of Kashmir, once exalted for the
lotus blooms in its lakes and the yellow tapestry of its mustard
fields, has become a valley of despair _ a place haunted by
senseless murder and hideous torture, wherever the famously sweet
winds blow.
</P>
<P>
   For a half century, India and Pakistan have fought over this
land, sustaining a hatred so venomous as to rival any in the world.
For each, possessing Kashmir is a matter of life and death, with
both persistently willing to forsake the former for the latter.
</P>
<P>
   A macabre carnival of killing has come to mock a once-storied
serenity as India suppresses a Pakistani-supported insurgency:
people blown apart, ambushed, caught in a crossfire, snatched and
disappeared. During the past decade, 24,000 have died by the Indian
government's official count. Others say 40,000 is a better
estimate. Others, 70,000.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Srinagar, the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir's summer
capital, life has assumed a quality of war-weary numbness and
morbid fatalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``If only we could turn back the clock,'' said Irfan Maqsood, a
21-year-old student, in a typical lament. ``The fighting goes on
and on, and for what? We belong to India, and India will never let
us go.''
</P>
<P>
   People have grown used to the street's stern accouterments.
Heavily armed soldiers or policemen are always within sight.
Bunkers are maintained every few blocks, their sandbags covered
with blue tarpaulin, rifle barrels peeping out of rectangular
slits. The police conduct dozens of ``cordon and search''
operations each day, surrounding a small area and then entering
homes and shops, rousting out the men and taking away suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Kashmir is caught in one of the world's violent loops, death
begetting death. A grenade is flung into the courtyard of a police
station. An hour later, in a crowded, airless hospital ward,
Mohammad Yusuf Mir, a wounded policeman strung to an IV, is
coupling his moans with an oath: ``Whoever did this, I hate them. I
curse them. I'll kill them.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebellion itself began 10 years ago. Weapons flooded in,
tourists scurried out. At first, the insurgency was home-grown.
Kashmiri youth, shouting azadi, or freedom, became guerrillas,
trying to send India packing with a few well-placed bombs and
high-profile kidnappings. Shopkeepers gave them cash. Mothers made
them sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   To New Delhi, this was a threat to its nationhood, to Islamabad
an opportunity to wage war by proxy. India has since tried to stamp
out the revolt with all the fury of an enraged elephant, while
Pakistan has tried to provoke the uprising further and arm it and
bend it to its will.
</P>
<P>
   Today, what is left in the valley is a populace stunned with
confusion and sorrow, unwilling to give up the dream of
independence and yet unprepared to endure more killing. People feel
betwixt and between, their fate out of their hands. A common
complaint is that India and Pakistan seem pitted against each other
in a fight to the death of the last Kashmiri.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to stand up and say to them both, `Thank you for
loving us, but spare us the honor of being your battleground,'''
said Muzafar Baig, a prominent lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Life seems forever transformed. A valley whose culture was once
identified with the gentle teachings of Sufi mystics is now
overwhelmed by the culture of the gun and the morality of the
mercenary. Insurgency and counterinsurgency have bled into one
another. Kashmir has become a place of double-crosses and extortion
and vaporous truths.
</P>
<P>
   Some days back, ``Papa Kishtwari,'' a man with hard eyes and
strong opinions, sat in his house sipping tea as a dozen or so
supplicants waited outside to tell him their troubles. His real
name is Ghulam Hassan Lone and he is one of the leaders of the
so-called ``friendlies,'' onetime insurgents who surrendered and
then switched sides, becoming India's eyes and ears against the
insurgents and sometimes its fists.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled his days as an anti-India militant. According to
him, Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency gave him money,
guns and marching orders. ``They told us what positions to hit,''
he said. ``They gave us a list of people to be shot dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he changed allegiance. The money was still good, the work
similar, he said. He would identify militants for the Indian
security forces. ``There is a policy of extra-judicial killings,''
he said, something India denies. ``This is done to impress New
Delhi.''
</P>
<P>
   But the days of the ``friendlies'' appear to be over. India has
changed tactics and relies more on its own intelligence units to
ferret out militants. ``Pakistan used us, then India used us,''
Papa Kishtwari said bitterly. ``This is what they do in Kashmir _
use us.''

SOUTHWEST'S KELLEHER BATTLING PROSTATE CANCER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG HASSELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Herb Kelleher, the colorful captain of Southwest Airlines, began
radiation treatment for prostate cancer Wednesday in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The 68-year-old chief executive will undergo eight weeks of
radiation treatment at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, where
doctors say his prognosis for a full recovery is excellent.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher said the illness will not interfere with his ability to
run the airline. He will remain at the helm while getting daily
treatments at M.D. Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I wish it were called the M.D. Anderson Acne Center
or the M.D. Anderson Hemorrhoid Center, but it isn't,'' Kelleher
said Wednesday, maintaining the offbeat sense of humor that's made
him a celebrity among Texas CEOs.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said Kelleher will jet into Houston for daily
treatments and fly back to the company's headquarters in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher said his illness is a ``rather mundane, routine and
fairly insignificant case of prostate cancer'' that was detected in
its early stages. His Houston doctors reached their diagnosis some
weeks ago, ``and since then I have been undergoing a series of
consultations and also, what I think is fair to describe as a
somewhat undignified series of tests.''
</P>
<P>
   While Kelleher was able to make light of the situation, some
observers say it calls attention to a serious issue for Southwest.
No one has been publicly tabbed as Kelleher's heir should he be
unable to continue serving as the company's chairman, president and
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will accelerate the board of directors pushing Herb to
designate a successor,'' predicted airline analyst John Pincavage
of Warburg Dillon Read. ``That's probably a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a clear succession plan was an issue at the
company's most recent annual meeting. A shareholder proposed
stripping Kelleher of one of his titles and requiring him to share
more responsibility with other executives. The shareholder cited
Kelleher's heavy smoking, his fondness for whiskey and his status
as a frequent flier as threats to his longevity. The shareholder
failed to show up at the annual meeting, and the proposal was
tabled.
</P>
<P>
   When someone at the annual meeting asked Kelleher if he smokes
too much, he replied, ``I smoke the appropriate amount.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters Wednesday via a conference call, Kelleher
said he may experience a loss of energy in the last two weeks of
radiation treatment. But he sees no reason to appoint a successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no need to update any succession plan because our
board discusses that issue on a regular basis and has done so for a
good number of years,'' Kelleher said. ``Insofar as we know, it's
not going to involve any disruption or even any interruption in
Southwest Airlines. So it doesn't change anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The financial community seems to share his sense of calm about
the company's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people will get nervous and say, `Oh gee, Herb is so
important,''' Pincavage said. ``But look. Herb has created a very
strong, very deep management team. His role _ and he will probably
admit this _ is to be head cheerleader.''
</P>
<P>
   Southwest's stock barely moved Wednesday, falling 1/8 to 16 3/8
on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``Southwest has a lot of depth in their management, and we feel
comfortable with that,'' said Linda Bannister, an analyst with
Edward Jones Investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as he can hold a shot glass, I want him running this
airline, and so does every Southwest shareholder,'' Goldman Sachs
analyst Glenn Engel told The Associated Press. ``The day when it
appears Herb is mortal, then Southwest's stock will go down more
than it did today.''
</P>
<P>
   Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer among American
men, after skin cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates
179,300 new cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed in the
United States this year, and about 37,000 men will die of this
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher co-founded Southwest with the help of Texas businessman
Rollin King back in 1971. The fledgling airline flew routes linking
Dallas, Houston and San Antonio. It gained a measure of notoriety
by outfitting its stewardesses in hot pants. In those pre-PC days,
the stewardesses served drinks and called them Love Potions. They
served peanuts and called them Love Bites.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher's outrageous antics over the years have included
dressing up like Elvis Presley and Corporal Klinger, the
cross-dressing character from the television show ``MASH.'' He once
arm-wrestled the head of another company for the rights to claim
ownership of the marketing phrase, ``Just Plane Smart.'' His
trainer wore an ammunition belt filled with airline-sized bottles
of Wild Turkey, Kelleher's favorite brand of booze.
</P>
<P>
   ``Herb's biggest contribution to that company is creation of the
Southwest culture. That culture allows people to enjoy their
work,'' Pincavage said. ``Their employees feel like they are
contributing and are part of a team. They like working for
Southwest, and that's why customers like Southwest.''
</P>
<P>
   One month ago, Kelleher was named CEO of the Year by Chief
Executive magazine. While other U.S. companies make more money than
Southwest, the CEOs who voted for Kelleher said they are ``in awe''
of his ability to attract quality employees and keep them happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strength of Southwest Airlines is the culture,'' Kelleher
told USA Today in July. He expressed no doubt that the company's
culture would survive him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The culture would probably overthrow anyone who did not
nourish it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the cult of personality built up around himself
would not damage Southwest's popular appeal after he's gone because
it will still offer appealing fares.

 SRINAGAR, Kashmir: _ use us.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The History Since '47, a Puzzle Without a Solution
</P>
<P>
   Kashmir is one of the world's most confounding morasses, a
52-year-old custody battle where the contesting parties disagree on
the details of every scrap of their common history.
</P>
<P>
   The very term Kashmir is ambiguous. Most often, it is used as
shorthand for the entire Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, which
has about 8 million people.
</P>
<P>
   But the state has several distinct regions, of which the fabled
valley, with slightly more than half of the population, is but one.
Only there do people speak Kashmiri _ and only there do people have
a distinct feeling of being a separate nation. Jammu is roughly
two-thirds Hindu, though there are districts with a large Muslim
majority. Sparsely populated Ladakh is half Buddhist and half
Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   Once a princely state ruled by a maharajah, Jammu and Kashmir
had even broader boundaries, including territory now claimed by
Pakistan and China. In 1947, the year that India and Pakistan were
born, the departing British colonial masters demanded that the
subcontinent's 562 landed maharajahs opt to belong to one infant
nation or the other.
</P>
<P>
   Hari Singh, the state's Hindu maharajah, dithered past the
deadline, but then, as tribesmen from Pakistan's northern frontier
aided a local rebellion, he decided to cast the lot of his
predominantly Muslim domain with predominantly Hindu India.
</P>
<P>
   To many Muslims, it seemed the land had fallen under the thumb
of the infidel. War broke out between India and Pakistan, and an
ensuing cease-fire left about one-third of the densely populated
part of the state with Pakistan, where it remains today.
</P>
<P>
   Jammu and Kashmir, while never happily a part of India,
nevertheless lived in relative peace until the rebellion.
Statewide, between Jan. 1, 1990, and July 15, 1999, the state
police recorded 7,922 attacks with explosives, 9,393 random
firings, 12,460 ``cross firings,'' 3,553 abductions, 619 rocket
attacks. The years 1993 through 1996 were the worst.
</P>
<P>
   During the past few years, the mayhem had actually moderated.
Death tolls were nearly halved, curfews in Srinagar were lifted.
Indeed, this spring some 100,000 tourists _ mostly Indians _
visited Kashmir. Dal Lake was again busy with colorful boats, the
oarsmen gently paddling while visitors delighted in the graceful
swoop of a kingfisher.
</P>
<P>
   But then in late May came ``Kargil,'' the convenient term given
to 10 weeks of fighting along snow-capped peaks in Kashmir.
Pakistani-supported militants _ New Delhi contends they were mostly
Pakistani soldiers _ sneaked into India and seized the high ground
above a vital supply route. India responded with air power and a
vast deployment, with both sides finally braking at the brink of
what would have been their fourth all-out war.
</P>
<P>
   As the Kargil battleground, named for a town in central Kashmir,
calmed down, hit-and-run tactics picked up throughout the entire
state. More than 1,000 militants have recently crossed into
Kashmir, making a total force of about 3,500 insurgents, Indian
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new ones are better-armed and better-trained than we're
used to,'' said Gurbachan Jagat, the state police chief. ``They're
professionals, with good radios and heavy explosives.''
</P>
<P>
   The character of the insurgency has been steadily changing, too.
</P>
<P>
   According to Indian military observers, about 40 percent of the
militants are now foreigners, mostly Pakistanis but also Afghans.
They belong to various groups _ with varying political and
religious beliefs _ but a few of the most powerful, like
Lashkar-e-Taiba, are Islamic fundamentalists who have come to
Kashmir on a holy war.
</P>
<P>
   While the Vale of Kashmir is overwhelmingly Muslim, a less
dogmatic version of the faith is commonly practiced here, and
Kashmiri nationalism has never been equated with religion. To some
then, it seems the fight for independence has taken odd turns and
attracted strange confederates.
</P>
<P>
   Yasin Malik, a chain-smoking, gangling 33-year-old, is head of
the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front, the most important group
among the rebels. Since 1994, it has abided by a self-proclaimed
cease-fire, but it does not condemn anti-India violence by others,
anything to keep the pot stirring. Still, Mr. Malik has regrets:
``It is too bad that when Lashkar-e-Taiba speaks, people believe
this is the voice of the Kashmiri people.''
</P>
<P>
   The active guerrilla groups are not united in any single
military strategy, though they now often avoid the concentration of
Indian security forces in the valley and operate in the thick
forests and isolated villages of Jammu. One tactic is to massacre
Hindu innocents, hoping to set off communal violence. Another is
political assassination. Another involves bold rocket attacks
against army installations.
</P>
<P>
   New Delhi continues to use a heavy club to fight back, something
that has repeatedly drawn condemnations from international human
rights groups. From the Indian government's vantage point, however,
the nation deserves to be commended for restraint.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've kept our response low-key and measured,'' said Gov.
Girish Saxena, New Delhi's man in Srinagar. ``We did not use tanks
and armed personnel carriers. We have generally confined our
response to small arms, and that has made an impression on people
that we are trying to deal with the situation in a civilized way.''
</P>
<P>
   India maintains about 200,000 regular army troops in Kashmir,
most of them warily guarding against a Pakistani attack. Fighting
the guerrillas is now largely left to 125,000 others from
paramilitary units and the state police, Saxena said. Additionally,
the state has armed 18,000 villagers _ mostly Hindus in Jammu _ to
defend themselves. They call them village defense committees.
</P>
<P>
   That is a lot of firepower _ and its presence fuels the
continued reproach of rights groups. It is not difficult to locate
men with convincing tales of recent torture, ugly engravings on
their skin, a palette of black and blue on their limbs. Parents
wait by the gates of army camps and police stations, holding photos
of sons who have been taken into custody and never seen again.
</P>
<P>
   Bystanders are too often mistaken for perpetrators, said Raja
Banoo, whose 16-year-old son has been gone for 28 months. ``Before
the army took him, they beat him right in front of me and dug a
hole and said, `We'll bury your son alive,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The state government opened its own human rights commission in
August 1997, but it is widely regarded as toothless.

   By and large, the state police have been entrusted to look into
rights abuses. Their records show a total of 3,197 complaints,
including allegations of 1,105 ``custodial deaths,'' 1,248
``innocent killings'' and 512 ``disappearances.''

<P>
   The Future: Could Clinton Act As Peacemaker?
</P>
<P>
   A common sentiment heard in Kashmir comes out as a question: Why
isn't the world paying more attention? And if there is a silver
lining to the Kargil episode, it is that for a time the world did _
and may still. With India and Pakistan now nuclear powers,
hostilities between them have apocalyptic potential. A turning
point in the crisis came after Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif met with President Clinton in Washington on July 4.
</P>
<P>
   This may be grasping at straws, but many here are putting
considerable hope in a two-word pledge issued after the
Clinton-Sharif meeting. The president agreed to take a ``personal
interest'' in urging the resumption of Indian-Pakistani peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
   How personally he will be involved, and how interested he truly
is, is uncertain. America's position remains that Kashmir is a
disputed territory, and a solution is best left to bilateral talks
between the two nations. That would be fine with India, which
considers Kashmir to be an open-and-shut case and officially
refuses to acknowledge that a dispute even exists.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kashmiris are encouraged. Shahid-ul-Islam, a former
guerrilla commander from the group Hezbollah Mujahedeen, said: ``We
take a positive sign from Kosovo. We had thought Mr. Clinton was
anti-Muslim, but now we believe he may be an angel for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdul Ghani Bhat, a professor and head of the Muslim Conference
political party, said: ``The president of America wants to go down
in the annals of history as a peacemaker. That is why he said
`personal interest.' He will force India to negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hopes to visit the subcontinent early next year _ and
certainly the issue of Kashmir will come up. It has poisoned the
relations between two poor countries with a combined population of
1.1 billion _ nearly a fifth of all humanity.
</P>
<P>
   But if the president forcefully enters the Kashmir fray, he will
find himself wandering within that 52-year-old morass, which has so
defiantly resisted solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Twice, back in 1948 and 1949, India committed itself to a
U.N.-sponsored plebiscite, allowing the state's people to decide
whether to be part of it or Pakistan. This vote, however, was made
to be contingent on a pullback of armed forces by both sides, an
exercise requiring trust. The vote has yet to occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``That referendum must be held and we would abide by the
decision, but the choices must include independence,'' said Malik
of the Liberation Front.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But the results of any statewide vote _ even one with three
choices _ is likely to leave as many people dissatisfied as there
are now. Ladakh and parts of Jammu would want to stay with India,
parts of Jammu would prefer Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with that prospect, a half century of thinking has
yielded any number of options, including joint sovereignty
arrangements and ways of dividing up the state between India and
Pakistan and allowing the valley to become independent. Regional
plebiscites, instead of a statewide one, is another suggestion
frequently made.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But nothing will happen unless all parties are willing to
negotiate and compromise. ``President Clinton could get everyone to
talk, don't you think?'' said Abdul Majid Wani, a retired engineer
who was walking in a cemetery called Martyr's Graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   His son is buried there. Ashfaq Majeed Wani, one of the first
young men to take up arms against India, was killed on March 30,
1990. He was 23, and when his father identified the body, he
counted 21 bullet holes. Ashfaq was also missing several fingers,
and the elder Wani proudly speculated that his son died with a
grenade in hand.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 1,000 simple graves in the cemetery, which
is beside a soccer field. Wani conducted a brief tour, pausing at
one marker or another to describe more death. At the end of one row
rested a 4-year-old, Master Shaheed Yawar, killed in a crossfire.
Wani did not want the poetics on a nearby sign to be missed.
</P>
<P>
   It said: ``Do not shun the gun, my dear younger ones. The war
for freedom is yet to be won.''

SOME SEE SCOUT RETREAT IN GAY POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Call it the junior version of the military's ``don't
ask, don't tell'' policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Narragansett, R.I., Council of the Boy Scouts of America,
which has about 20,000 Scouts, issued a statement Wednesday
clarifying its stand on homosexuality following a recent episode
involving a 16-year-old Eagle Scout who, when asked, said he was
gay.
</P>
<P>
   Although the council said in its statement that it did not
accept ``known or avowed homosexuals'' as Scouts or leaders and
that it saw homosexuality as inconsistent with the Scout oath to be
morally straight, it also said that as a matter of policy, it did
not inquire about sexual orientation. And in the case at issue, the
gay teen-ager has been allowed to remain a Scout.
</P>
<P>
   Some gay and civil rights advocates said the ``don't ask''
policy seemed to mark a certain retreat by the Narragansett Council
from the national Scouts' anti-gay position.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding was that gays were not allowed in the Boy
Scouts, but what they now seem to be saying is that they have a
`don't ask, don't tell' policy, which is different,'' said Steven
Brown, executive director of the Rhode Island chapter of the
American Civil Liberties Union. ``What has happened in this case is
that a gay teen-ager has been allowed to remain in the Boy Scouts.
And the Boy Scouts know he's gay.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman at the Boy Scouts' national headquarters, in Irving,
Texas, referred all questions about the matter to the Narragansett
Council, The Associated Press reported. There, Peter Reid, a
volunteer acting as spokesman, said that he did not believe the
policy was new, that it did not diverge from the policy of the
national headquarters and that the statement had been written in
conjunction with headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, others saw something new, and suggested that it might
have stemmed in part from the New Jersey Supreme Court ruling last
week that struck down the state Boy Scouts' ban on homosexuals. The
Scouts' national headquarters plans to appeal that ruling to the
U.S. Supreme Court, but in the ranks, members say, opinions on the
issue vary.
</P>
<P>
   The case that led to the council's statement Wednesday concerned
an Eagle Scout who was serving as an office employee at Camp Yagoog
in Hopkinton, R.I. According to local press accounts, which Reid
confirmed, the trouble began when a 37-year-old troop leader was
accused of molesting a 13-year-old Scout on the night of Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In the tension that followed, the camp's director reportedly
asked the Eagle Scout to confirm rumors that he was gay; when he
did, the director reportedly told him he could not return to work.
The firing prompted a sit-down protest by members of the camp's
staff, and the youth himself complained to the state Human Rights
Commission. He has since been taken back to work, and his
membership in the Scouts affirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island has some of the strictest employment discrimination
laws in the country, and the Boy Scouts would have been in deep
trouble over the firing, said Brown, the ACLU official. But the
question of whether the Boy Scouts can oust homosexuals, he said,
remains unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, the Narragansett Council said that at a
meeting with the Eagle Scout and his parents, ``it was established
that no basis existed to question the eligibility of the youth for
membership in the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Accordingly,'' the statement said, ``we now consider the
matter closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean that the question about the boy's sexual
orientation, which should never have been asked in the first place
under the Scout policy outlined Wednesday, was effectively
``unasked?''
</P>
<P>
   Reid said this was a ``fair reading'' of the sentence.

RIVAL QUITS SENATE RACE, BUT COULD RETURN IF GIULIANI DELAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAY SHORE, N.Y. _ Defiant and describing himself as the
strongest potential Republican candidate for next year's race for
the U.S. Senate, Rep. Rick Lazio nonetheless acceded to his party
leadership Wednesday and tabled his campaign, in deference to New
York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   But Lazio called on the mayor to definitively declare his
intentions by Aug. 31, warning that further delay could undermine a
Republican candidate's chances against Hillary Rodham Clinton, the
presumed Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to step up to the plate and be a candidate if that is
what he wants,'' Lazio, surrounded by cheering supporters at a
reception hall perched on the water here, said of Giuliani. ``I
think the time has passed for us to run around and play games. I
think the people deserve better. I think everybody is expecting an
announcement by him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to be not just a loyal Republican, but to do
something, frankly that is difficult: to put my personal agenda
aside,'' said Lazio, a three-term congressman. ``I'm asking him to
do the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In trying to nudge Giuliani to declare his candidacy, Lazio held
open the possibility of getting back into the race if Giuliani did
not act by the month's end. But the mayor, who was in Cooperstown
to speak to a group of Republican women, made clear that he had no
intention of taking Lazio's suggestion on how he should proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hardly going to let this event impose a time frame on
me,'' Giuliani said. ``I'm great at resisting pressure. The more
pressure, the more relaxed I become.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, Giuliani was clearly cheered that Lazio's near-exit
from the race had spared him from the threat of a primary
challenge. And he left little doubt that he intended to enter the
contest. ``Looks that way, looks that way,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's effective withdrawal came in response to a direct,
public request by Gov. George Pataki last Friday, and it took the
Republican Party one step closer to ending a drama that had
threatened to become a distraction. Lazio's continuing threat of a
primary challenge to Giuliani was evidence of the deep animosity
between the New York mayor and Pataki who had, until last Friday,
quietly encouraged Lazio's preparations for a primary campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, 41, repeatedly declined to say what he would do if
Giuliani ignored the August deadline. However, Lazio, who is viewed
as one of the stronger candidates on the Republican bench, left
little doubt that he would follow the direction of Pataki who, in
turn, has left little doubt that he wants to see Giuliani as the
candidate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In another sign of Republican leaders deferring to Giuliani,
state Republican chairman William Powers appeared to move away from
his own attempt to set an Aug. 31 deadline for the mayor to act.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Powers was quoted in The New York Post as saying,
``The sooner he makes a decision the better, and I'd like to see
him do it by the end of August.'' Lazio repeatedly cited Powers'
statement.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, Powers dispatched an aide, Dan Allen, to say that
he did not intend to say that Giuliani needed to declare his plans
by Aug. 31. Powers did not return telephone calls seeking a
clarification.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio made his announcement at a news conference here that drew
an extraordinary turnout of reporters, given that Lazio does not
have a national reputation and that the announcement was made 60
miles from New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Some national news organizations have assigned reporters on a
full-time basis to cover Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is considering
seeking the Democratic nomination for the Senate. Since she had no
public events Wednesday in New York, many of those reporters made
the trip out to Bay Shore, which is better known as a launching
point for ferries to Fire Island.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he bowed to Pataki's wishes, Lazio left no doubt that he
considered the move a mistake. ``I think I am the better
candidate,'' he said. ``I am respecting the governor's decision
without agreeing with the governor's decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said he considered himself the superior candidate to run
against Mrs. Clinton. ``This is not about personal ambition, this
is not a stepping stone for me,'' Lazio said. ``This is about a
desire to legislate and to provide and serve the people of New
York. ''
</P>
<P>
   He described the emerging race as a ``contest of celebrities''
and suggested that both Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton were out of touch
with the concerns of ordinary New Yorkers. ``I don't live in Gracie
Mansion or the White House,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio seemed to hold out the hope that if Giuliani did not act,
Pataki would review the situation and open the door for Lazio. But
in one unscripted moment, as Lazio reviewed his years in Congress,
it became clear that he was not particularly optimistic that that
would happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the things I've been working on in Congress,''
gazing over his huge audience of reporters. ``I'll be working on
them when I go back in the House. I won't stop working on them.''

THE ASSAULT WEAPON OF FREE SPEECH  
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Wounded kids. Dead kids. Doesn't seem to matter one way or the
other, except to their folks.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the rest of the nation is concerned, nothing has
changed and nothing will change, even after a lunatic with an
assault weapon opens fire on children.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association and its pals in Congress say gun
control is an unconstitutional violation of a citizen's Second
Amendment right to bear arms, and most times they win, no matter
how many bodies pile up. Or where.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles. Atlanta. Littleton, Colo. Take your pick.
</P>
<P>
   The gun lobbyists shrug their shoulders and hold up the Bill of
Rights (ratified in 1791) as if its words were carved in stone
rather than scribbled on paper.
</P>
<P>
   With all the politicians they have in their pockets, it's become
a waste of time arguing with them.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, what if they're right? Wouldn't that be would great
news for guys like me?
</P>
<P>
   If the NRA is correct, then what applies to amendment No. 2 must
also apply to amendment No. 1, which reads in part, ``Congress
shall make no law. . .abridging the freedom of speech, or of the
press.''
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing in there about slander. Nothing about
misrepresentation, distortion, hoax, fabrication, con games.
</P>
<P>
   We can let the lying begin.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to firearms, NRA types fight even minor
restrictions, such as banning ``cop-killer'' bullets or weapons
designed to wipe out the greatest number of humans in the least
amount of time.
</P>
<P>
   The second amendment doesn't include a word about assault
weapons or bullets that penetrate body armor, they argue.
</P>
<P>
   Such things presumably weren't as big as a problem in the 1790s
as they are in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Second Amendment purists believe if it's not in the
document, it doesn't count.
</P>
<P>
   If they're correct, then America's prisons are bursting with
wrongly convicted thieves and swindlers.
</P>
<P>
   The guy who verbally cheated old ladies out of their Social
Security checks was only exercising his constitutionally guaranteed
right to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   So was the man who lied about you behind your back.
</P>
<P>
   To your boss.
</P>
<P>
   In front of TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   So was the reporter who printed the article that ruined your
reputation, knowing all along it didn't contain a single true
statement.
</P>
<P>
   It's all ``free speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Read the amendment. It contains no exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere along the line, somebody got the idea that common
sense can be applied to the Constitution, or at least to certain
parts of it.
</P>
<P>
   In school, we're told the Supreme Court once ruled we don't have
the constitutional right to shout ``Fire!'' in a crowded theater.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the justices didn't know what they was talking
about.
</P>
<P>
   The First Amendment doesn't outlaw any particular kind of
speech, just as the Second doesn't outlaw any particular kind of
weapon, or bullet.
</P>
<P>
   If the NRA is correct about guns, then the same must be true
about words.
</P>
<P>
   There would be no such thing as ``fraudulent schemes,'' only
constitutionally-protected schemes.
</P>
<P>
   And no such thing as defamation.
</P>
<P>
   And no such thing as libel.
</P>
<P>
   If we all have the constitutionally protected right to bear
arms, then we also have the right to bear false witness.
</P>
<P>
   But, only if we choose to correct the situation by wiping out a
bunch of ill-advised laws.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr. walked into a Los Angeles
Jewish community center and began shooting off an Uzi. All we ask
is that every citizen have the unrestricted right to shoot off his
mouth. To stretch the truth, to deceive, to mislead.
</P>
<P>
   Without fear of prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   To have the same rights, in other words, as a gun lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   Or politician. &QL;

N.J. HIGH COURT BACKS DEATH PENALTY FOR `MEGAN' KILLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ New Jersey's highest court on Wednesday upheld
the death sentence imposed on the man convicted of raping and
murdering 7-year-old Megan Kanka in 1994 and said that the deluge
of pretrial publicity surrounding the case had not unfairly
prejudiced jurors against the defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the man, Jesse Timmendequas, had argued that the
extensive coverage of his case, prompted largely by the laws that
Megan's killing spawned across the nation, made it impossible for
him to get a fair trial. Because New Jersey law forbids jurors to
consider a defendant's criminal history, his lawyers argued that
the death sentence be reversed.
</P>
<P>
   But on a 4-3 vote, the Supreme Court ruled that the original
trial judge had taken reasonable steps to minimize the effects of
the publicity by bringing in jurors from a neighboring county and
questioning them extensively about their ability to weigh the
evidence presented in court without being influenced by television
or newspaper accounts of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the defendant's confession and the overwhelming evidence
against him, suspicion or knowledge of defendant's prior
convictions would not have affected the jury's determination of
whether he killed Megan or the outcome of the penalty phase,''
wrote Justice Marie Garibaldi, on behalf of the majority.
</P>
<P>
   Timmendequas, 37, will remain on death row, but has several more
avenues for appeal, which are expected to take years to complete.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was one of three death penalty decisions released by
the court Wednesday, each of them upholding the sentence by a vote
of 4-3. Although none seemed to establish sweeping legal precedents
or set standards for imposing capital punishment, the narrow margin
of all three votes was notable because state officials are
scheduled in September to carry out their first execution since
1963.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, John Martini has asked for the past five years to
be executed; unless he changes his mind and allows the public
defender's office to appeal his case in federal court, he will be
executed by lethal injection Sept. 22. Martini has been convicted
of three killings, and is sentenced to die for the 1989 kidnapping
and murder of a Bergen County businessman, Irving Flax.
</P>
<P>
   Although Martini has exhausted state appeals, some death penalty
opponents said the slim margins of Wednesday's decisions were a
sign that the state Supreme Court still had misgivings about the
death penalty law.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clear that the court is divided on this issue,'' said
Deputy Public Defender Claudia Van Wyck. ``These are very troubling
cases.''
</P>
<P>
   In many recent capital cases, the court has voted 6-1 to uphold
death penalty cases. But two justices are retiring this year,
including Alan Handler, who has consistently opposed capital
punishment, and it is unclear how the incoming judges are likely to
vote on death penalty cases.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the court Wednesday upheld death sentences for
Robert Simon, who pleaded guilty to the 1995 murder of a Franklin
Township police officer, and Marko Bey, who was convicted of the
1983 killing of a Monmouth County woman.
</P>
<P>
   Simon, a member of the Warlocks motorcycle gang, had argued that
his death sentence should be reversed because his confession in the
shooting of Officer Ippolito Gonzalez had been coerced. Defense
lawyers said gang members had threatened Simon's family if he did
not confess and deflect blame from another gang member who had also
been charged in the killing. But the trial court judge ruled that
Simon's confession was far more credible than his subsequent claims
of coercion, and the state Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld that
finding.
</P>
<P>
   Bey, who was convicted of murdering Carol Peniston, 47, of
Asbury Park, had argued that his lawyer during the original trial
was incompetent and denied him the right to speak to the jury. But
the court Wednesday rejected Bey's appeal, saying there was no
evidence that he had asked to speak to the jury and little chance
that his words would have persuaded them to spare him the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Bey has now exhausted his state appeals and is filing appeals in
federal court, a process expected to take three years.
</P>
<P>
   But the most noteworthy decision by the court Wednesday involved
Timmendequas, whose record of sexual offenses brought a nationwide
movement to legally regulate the movements of convicted sex
offenders who are released from prison.
</P>
<P>
   Timmendequas had two convictions for sexual abuse before he
moved onto the Kanka's street in the Trenton suburb of Hamilton.
His arrest spurred New Jersey and other states to adopt laws
requiring that law enforcement officials track the addresses of sex
offenders who are released from prison and warn their new
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the case went to trial in 1997, those regulations
had become known nationwide as Megan's Laws, and many New Jersey
residents were also familiar with the nickname Timmendequas was
given by the press: ``The Monster.''
</P>
<P>
   He was portrayed in countless media reports as a cold-hearted
child molester who stalked children and never expressed remorse for
killing Megan, defense lawyers said. During the trial's penalty
phase, many newspapers and television stations also reported that
Timmendequas' brother hoped he would receive a death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   In his dissent, Handler argued that the publicity about the case
was so pervasive it was unlikely jurors could disregard
Timmendequas' prior sex offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``One can say with certainty that the crime committed by Jesse
Timmendequas was horrific, so uniformly condemned that it changed
the landscape for sex offenses nationwide,'' Handler wrote. ``With
equal certainty, however, one can say that this defendant did not
receive the most basic right of our justice system and
civilization: a fair trial.''
</P>
<P>
   But a majority of justices upheld the verdict, saying that the
trial judge took reasonable precautions to provide an untainted
jury.
</P>
<P>
   Even at a news conference Wednesday, reporters continued to
press public defenders for details about Timmendequas' emotional
response to the Kanka killing, and one reporter asked whether
Timmendequas has ever expressed remorse for the killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He certainly made what I would consider a remorseful statement
to the jury during the trial,'' said Jay Wilensky, an assistant
public defender who argued Timmendequas' appeal. ``I think that
speaks for itself.

BAUER NOT AFRAID TO SPREAD ANTI-ABORTION MESSAGE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ It doesn't take Gary Bauer long to broach the
subject that many fellow Republican presidential candidates would
rather not dwell on.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a reception Wednesday, the conservative activist
turned presidential contender ranked his top priorities. The first,
he made it clear, was to protect ``our unborn children.``
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unbelievable to me that 1.5 million American children
don't get to take the first breath of life,'' Bauer told members of
the Iowa Family Policy Center, which is affiliated with the
conservative Christian group Focus on the Family.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer went even further and slammed 1996 Republican presidential
nominee Bob Dole and current GOP presidential front-runner George
W. Bush for not doing enough to push social conservative issues
such as abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see in my party a mushiness that leads people to flirt with
third and fourth parties,'' Bauer said.``We seem ashamed and
embarrassed about our conservative heritage.``
</P>
<P>
   The Washington-based activist and former Reagan administration
official who has never held elective office has been barnstorming
across Iowa this summer hoping to attract social conservatives, who
over the past decade have wielded influence in the Republican
Party.
</P>
<P>
   At this Saturday's straw poll in Ames, Bauer would certainly
like to emulate the success of religious crusader Pat Robertson,
who shocked the political establishment in 1987 by winning the
straw poll, besting Dole and Bush's father, who was then vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   But this year those voters energized by such issues as abortion
and school prayer appear to be split among several GOP candidates,
including commentator Pat Buchanan, Alan Keyes, magazine mogul
Steve Forbes and former Vice President Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   While Buchanan united many of the social conservatives in 1996,
his late entry into the race this time meant that many of his top
organizers had already been recruited by other campaigns. This time
activists say that Buchanan does not seem to be exciting supporters
as much as he did in the past.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Forbes, who last time concentrated almost
solely on economic issues, has retooled his message to include a
heavy dose of anti-abortion rhetoric. He has also hired the former
field worker for the state Christian Coalition to help recruit
social conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   But some political observers believe that Bauer has most
effectively tapped into the extensive network of churches for
volunteers who can be relied upon to show up in Ames for the straw
poll and again at their party caucuses next winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to surprise some people,'' predicted Ione Dilley,
acting director of the state's Christian Coalition. Dilley said
Bauer's people ``are really working the churches.``
</P>
<P>
   But Dilley said that social conservatives are sprinkled among
all the GOP campaigns, including those of Bush and Elizabeth Dole,
who hail from the party's more moderate wing. And because all the
Republican candidates say they oppose abortion, social
conservatives don't have to rally behind one candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But there are shades of difference on the abortion issue. And
Bauer lets his audiences know that unlike some other candidates,
such as Bush and Dole, he would use abortion as a litmus test in
appointing judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bauer is one of those people who lives, eats and sleeps
pro-life,'' said Samona Joy Yentes, the legislative director of the
Iowa Right to Life committee.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, Bauer delivers a polished and forceful
presentation. He has been more willing than most of the candidates
to attack Bush, accusing the Texas governor of not taking the
sanctity of life seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer has also criticized Bush for backing the Clinton
administration's position on continuing trading ties with China.
Bauer holds that the United States should not grant China Most
Favored Nation trading status because of human rights abuses there.
</P>
<P>
   Some people said they are impressed with Bauer's impassioned
defense of his positions. .
</P>
<P>
   ``You tend to get rah-rah behind people when you know where they
stand,'' said Chris Hurley, who came to hear Bauer on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Hurley said that this year a number of candidates who appeal
to her. She noted that Forbes had sent her more mailings than any
of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't ruled anybody out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Others said that although they make like Bauer's positions they
were more interested in a Republican winning the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now with the Republican picks you say who is electable
and who is not,'' said Dave Kely, a teacher who attended the Bauer
reception. Asked if he would vote for Bauer, Kely said, ``probably
not.``

other, except to their folks.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the rest of the nation is concerned, nothing has
changed and nothing will change, even after a lunatic with an
assault weapon opens fire on children.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association and its pals in Congress say gun
control is an unconstitutional violation of a citizen's Second
Amendment right to bear arms, and most times they win, no matter
how many bodies pile up. Or where.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles. Atlanta. Littleton, Colo. Take your pick.
</P>
<P>
   The gun lobbyists shrug their shoulders and hold up the Bill of
Rights (ratified in 1791) as if its words were carved in stone
rather than scribbled on paper.
</P>
<P>
   With all the politicians they have in their pockets, it's become
a waste of time arguing with them.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, what if they're right? Wouldn't that be would great
news for guys like me?
</P>
<P>
   If the NRA is correct, then what applies to amendment No. 2 must
also apply to amendment No. 1, which reads in part, ``Congress
shall make no law. . .abridging the freedom of speech, or of the
press.''
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing in there about slander. Nothing about
misrepresentation, distortion, hoax, fabrication, con games.
</P>
<P>
   We can let the lying begin.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to firearms, NRA types fight even minor
restrictions, such as banning ``cop-killer'' bullets or weapons
designed to wipe out the greatest number of humans in the least
amount of time.
</P>
<P>
   The second amendment doesn't include a word about assault
weapons or bullets that penetrate body armor, they argue.
</P>
<P>
   Such things presumably weren't as big as a problem in the 1790s
as they are in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Second Amendment purists believe if it's not in the
document, it doesn't count.
</P>
<P>
   If they're correct, then America's prisons are bursting with
wrongly convicted thieves and swindlers.
</P>
<P>
   The guy who verbally cheated old ladies out of their Social
Security checks was only exercising his constitutionally guaranteed
right to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   So was the man who lied about you behind your back.
</P>
<P>
   To your boss.
</P>
<P>
   In front of TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   So was the reporter who printed the article that ruined your
reputation, knowing all along it didn't contain a single true
statement.
</P>
<P>
   It's all ``free speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Read the amendment. It contains no exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere along the line, somebody got the idea that common
sense can be applied to the Constitution, or at least to certain
parts of it.
</P>
<P>
   In school, we're told the Supreme Court once ruled we don't have
the constitutional right to shout ``Fire!'' in a crowded theater.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the justices didn't know what they was talking
about.
</P>
<P>
   The First Amendment doesn't outlaw any particular kind of
speech, just as the Second doesn't outlaw any particular kind of
weapon, or bullet.
</P>
<P>
   If the NRA is correct about guns, then the same must be true
about words.
</P>
<P>
   There would be no such thing as ``fraudulent schemes,'' only
constitutionally-protected schemes.
</P>
<P>
   And no such thing as defamation.
</P>
<P>
   And no such thing as libel.
</P>
<P>
   If we all have the constitutionally protected right to bear
arms, then we also have the right to bear false witness.
</P>
<P>
   But, only if we choose to correct the situation by wiping out a
bunch of ill-advised laws.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr. walked into a Los Angeles
Jewish community center and began shooting off an Uzi. All we ask
is that every citizen have the unrestricted right to shoot off his
mouth. To stretch the truth, to deceive, to mislead.
</P>
<P>
   Without fear of prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   To have the same rights, in other words, as a gun lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   Or politician. &QL;

EDITORIAL: TERROR IN GRANADA HILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Aug. 11:
</P>
<P>
   There are 192 million privately owned firearms in the United
States, one for nearly every adult American, and of these nearly 2
million are military-style assault weapons like the one that Buford
Furrow apparently used Tuesday when he appeared out of nowhere and
wounded five people at a Jewish community center in Granada Hills,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Since this was only the latest in a lengthening list of
shootings that have terrorized quiet places like schools and
offices, one is left to wonder how many more of these random
catastrophes will be required before Congress stops babbling about
the right to bear arms and does something serious about gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow, who is also suspected of killing a postal worker, has
been associated with various white supremacist organizations and
was quoted as saying that he intended the community center shooting
``to be a wake-up call to America to kill Jews.'' He may thus be
prosecutable not only under the laws governing attempted murder but
those governing hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one thing that links this man to all the killers
who were motivated not by prejudice but by different demons _ the
student shooters at Columbine High who felt picked upon, the day
trader in Atlanta depressed by stock market reversals, the worker
in Pelham, Ala., who nursed a grudge against his employers. None of
these people seemed to have any trouble getting the weapons they
needed to settle their private scores, indulge their crackpot
fantasies or further their twisted ideologies. Furrow's arsenal
included a high-powered rifle, several handguns and hand grenades.
</P>
<P>
   Set against this dispiriting landscape, Congress looks
preposterously negligent. The two main contenders for the
Democratic presidential nomination, Al Gore and Bill Bradley, are
trying to take the gun control debate to a place few politicians
have gone before, raising the hitherto touchy subject of gun
licensing and registration on a national scale.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress is simply incapable of thinking in those broad
terms. Indeed, the House went home for its August vacation without
approving a modest Senate bill whose most controversial provision
would simply extend existing law requiring background checks to gun
shows, where unlicensed dealers currently conduct an uninhibited
trade in everything from handguns to assault rifles.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Wednesday where or how Furrow had obtained his
weapons. But the point is that guns are far too readily available
and that the time has plainly come to start closing off the avenues
of access, especially for teen-agers and people like Furrow with
criminal records.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow this simple truth eludes those in the House who are in
thrall to the National Rifle Association. Instead they spend their
time trying to whittle what little the Senate has given them to
even tinier fractions _ a 24-hour period to conduct background
checks at gun shows, for example, or a narrower definition of gun
shows to allow smaller shows to escape new restrictions, as if the
guns at smaller shows were somehow less deadly than those at bigger
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow is part of a large problem whose consequences keep
growing. Congress is approaching that problem with a narrow vision
that seems to be getting narrower.

CUSTOMS TO CHANGE RULES ON BODY SEARCHES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill.)   (af)  
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Faced with lawsuits charging racial bias in body
searches, the Customs Service on Wednesday announced a package of
changes intended to revamp how the agency examines thousands of
people suspected of smuggling drugs into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Customs Service Commissioner Raymond Kelly told reporters that
the agency had decided to scrap its confusing and contradictory
guidelines that allowed inspectors wide lattitude to search almost
anyone, including people who seemed nervous or too calm, wore sun
glasses or loose fitting clothing.
</P>
<P>
   In their place, the agency is instituting a system based on
criteria that focus on a passenger's behavior and such factors as
whether the suspect has given inconsistent answers to an
inspector's questions, is the subject of an intelligence report or
has been detected by a drug sniffing dog.
</P>
<P>
   Personal searches are used to detect drug ``swallowers'' who
ingest drugs or those who hide drugs in their clothing or body
cavities. Last year, more than 50,000 people, of more than 71.5
million air passengers who passed through customs from overseas
flights, were subjected to some form of search on arrival in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those searched were only frisked or patted-down, but
about 2,000 people were subjected to more intrusive body searches,
including X-ray inspections, monitored bowel movements or
examinations of body cavities.
</P>
<P>
   A class action lawsuit filed in Chicago said that customs
inspectors arbitrarily subjected black women to intrusive and
humiliating physical searches, but found drugs in less than a
quarter of the searches.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said the agency has never had a policy of singling out
blacks or other minorities for searches. ``It's not part of our
policy,'' he said. ``We want to make certain that is not part of
our practices.''
</P>
<P>
   To protect the rights of passengers suspected of carrying drugs,
Kelly said that beginning Oct. 1, the agency would begin notifying
a federal magistrate anytime a passenger arriving at an airport
from overseas is held for more than four hours. In the past,
suspects were held for far longer periods without any judicial
notification.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Customs Service, which acknowledges that its
own record-keeping was sloppy, will begin collecting centralized
data that will help agency managers determine the success-rate of
searches and whether specific groups seem to be unfairly singled
out for examinations.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the searches said the changes were a positive, but
timid start first step and that much more needed to be done.
</P>
<P>
   Edward M. Fox, a lawyer who represents about 90 black women who
were subjected to searches after they landed at O'Hare
International Airport in Chicago, said, ``It's a good start but
they will need to go much further.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Fox said, most searches, including what he said
were abusive body examinations, were conducted within the four-hour
period set by Customs for asking a federal magistrate to rule on
whether there are reasonable grounds to hold a passenger for a
personal search. As a result, he said, the decision to seek a
magistrate's approval was ``window dressing.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes, some of which have already been put into effect,
are intended to increase managerial control over the system,
improve its efficiency and eliminate the number of searches that
turn up nothing and reduce the perception that the search process
is arbitrary, unfair and racially biased.

WHITNEY DARROW JR., 89, GENTLE SATIRIST OF MODERN LIFE, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whitney Darrow Jr., a witty, gently satiric cartoonist for The
New Yorker for 50 years, died on Tuesday at a hospital in
Burlington, Vt. He was 89 and lived with his wife, Mildred, in
Shelburne, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   Darrow, one of the last of the early New Yorker cartoonists _ a
group that included Charles Addams, James Thurber, Peter Arno,
George Price and Mary Petty _ published more than 1,500 cartoons in
the magazine from 1933 to 1982. He was considered a master
draftsman and, in contrast to some of his colleagues, he wrote his
own captions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a great creator of comic ideas, and he avoided most of
the standard cartoon cliches,'' Lee Lorenz, the former art editor
of The New Yorker, said Wednesday. Even away from the drawing
board, Darrow was known for his sense of humor and for being
shrewdly observant of the contradictions of human behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In the book ``The Art of the New Yorker, 1925-1995,'' Lorenz
said that with the death of Charles Saxon and the retirement of
Darrow, very few current contributors to the magazine ``could
produce the elegant full-page tour de force that was a hallmark of
these masters of the '30s and '40s.'' He added, ``Whitney Darrow's
wit is as sharp as his pen.'' Often he drew upper-middle-class
suburban couples he knew close-up from his many years living in
Wilton, Conn., the kind of people who might appear in the comic
stories of Peter De Vries, but Darrow depicted them without any
sense of malice.
</P>
<P>
   He was also expert at depicting children, finding a universality
in their demands. (A young boy in a turban says to his fakir
father, ``Dad, can I have the carpet tonight?'') Judges and
politicians populate his pictures, as well as characters of various
degrees of inebriation and windbags in all professions.
</P>
<P>
   He was equally adept with lecherous septuagenarians and sexy
women with low bodices, one subject in which he was evidently
influenced by Arno. Dining at a restaurant, a young woman says to
her escort, ``Goodness, Mr. Harrison, 78 isn't old!''
</P>
<P>
   In his humor he specialized in everyday absurdities, but always
with an artful Darrow twist. In one of Darrow's cartoons from the
'50s, a man wearing rabbit ears at a New Year's Eve party is
embracing a pert young blonde in a party hat as his formidable wife
appears at the door. ``Good heavens, Emma!'' he says. ``I thought
this was you.'' He could also be carried away by a streak of the
fanciful. In a time-trip comedy, a spaceship lands on the moon and
an astronaut discovers the Garden of Eden, with Eve on the verge of
taking a bite of the apple. The astronaut rushes up and says:
`Miss! Oh, Miss! For God's sake, stop!''
</P>
<P>
   One favorite object of his satire was art. Standing before
Manet's ``Dejeuner sur l'Herbe,'' a schoolteacher explains to the
tots in her charge, ``Well, it was sort of like a cookout.'' A
sharp-sighted hunting dog points to an abstraction titled ``Bird in
Flight.'' Two club ladies stand before a large sculpture of a
voluptuous nude, and one says, ``Why doesn't he pick on his own sex
for a change?'' Facing his latest painting, a tic-tac-toe of stark
white squares, a bearded bohemian artist with palette in hand
announces proudly: ``There! A message of good will for all
mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Darrow considered himself to be apolitical,
occasionally he touched on more topical subjects. Woman to travel
agent: ``I'm confused. Tell me again. Which countries have
dictators we like?''
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing a Darrow exhibition at a Manhattan gallery in 1978,
John Russell wrote in The New York Times: ``Whitney Darrow has been
one of the best cartoonists around for as long as anyone can
remember. He is an environmental cartoonist, in that he goes on
setting the scene in that misleadingly easygoing style of his until
he is ready for a one-liner. And what a one-liner!''
</P>
<P>
   Darrow was born in Princeton, N.J., where his father was one of
the founders of the Princeton University Press. Growing up in
Greenwich, Conn., he wrote parodies for his school paper. In 1931
he graduated from Princeton, where he wrote a humorous column for
The Daily Princetonian and was art editor of The Princeton Tiger.
He thought about being a writer but seemed to move naturally into
drawing. He studied with Thomas Hart Benton and other artists at
the Art Students League and in his early 20s began selling cartoons
to Judge, Life and College Humor. In 1933, at 24, he made his
breakthrough to The New Yorker at a time when, in Lorenz's words,
the cartoon, at least as The New Yorker was to popularize it, ``was
still being born.''
</P>
<P>
   Darrow helped move the cartoon many steps away from a
vaudeville-style gag line to a commentary on character. He quickly
became a regular at the magazine, one of the most prolific
contributors under the editorship of Harold Ross and, later,
William Shawn. During his heyday, Darrow published 50 cartoons a
year and also drew occasional covers. He always carried his
notebook, listening and looking for an idea that would spark his
humor.
</P>
<P>
   He published four collections, ``You're Sitting on My
Eyelashes,'' ``Give Up?'' (in the title cartoon, a woman tries to
figure out the identity of an exotic bird, which says, ``Give
Up?''), ``Stop, Miss'' and ``Please Pass the Hostess.'' He
illustrated books by Nathaniel Benchley, Jean Kerr and Johnny
Carson, among others, and did children's books.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by his son, Barton, of
Northampton, Mass., his daughter, Linda, of Charlotte, Vt., and two
grandsons, Jesse Ricciarelli of Barre, Vt. and John Ricciarelli of
Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in The Times in 1984, Darrow said: ``I'm
definitely a pessimist. I'm convinced we're all going to be blown
up any minute!'' One would never have known that from his cartoons,
which were marked by their cheerfulness and their natural
exuberance.

SHARE PRICE MORE THAN TRIPLES IN RED HAT'S PUBLIC OFFERING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (bl)  
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Wednesday's initial public offering by Red
Hat Inc., the leading distributor of the free Linux computer
operating system, saw the new shares more than triple in price by
the close of trading on the NASDAQ. It also touched off excitement
and some soul searching among the 12,000 Linux devotees assembled
here for the LinuxWorld Expo.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts said the market's eager embrace of Red Hat
indicated a belief in the potential for a free operating system to
be a commercial competitor to Microsoft Corp.'s Windows NT or
traditional commercial versions of Unix.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses are also finding that proposition credible. William
Peterson, an analyst for IDC, a market research firm, said that in
1998, 17 percent of servers used the Linux system, up from 6
percent the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Linux, a type of Unix operating system, was created eight years
ago by Linus Torvalds, then a 21-year-old student at the University
of Helsinki. Torvalds made the source code freely available and
invited other programmers to add to the system and find and correct
defects.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, it has been invented, line by line, by an army of
volunteer programmers _ a fact that gave conference-goers here
pause as they watched Red Hat's owners become instant
multi-millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   Linux is the best-known product of the open-source software
movement, a grass roots effort to create free, peer-reviewed
operating systems and applications programs to compete with
Microsoft, and many Expo attendees saw Red Hat's success in the
stock market as the ultimate institutional endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be great for Linux,'' said Anne Eagle, a Web
site developer in San Jose who sported a Styrofoam version of the
Linux mascot, a gray penguin, atop her head. ``It's going to put it
into the business arena.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Red Hat offering coincided with a better than 3
percent rise in the NASDAQ on Wednesday, it also came on the heels
of a brutal correction in Internet stocks in the last two weeks.
Red Hat opened at $14 and jumped as high as $56.75 before closing
at $52.0625.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts characterized the market reaction as an endorsement of
the notion that marketing a free operating system can be
profitable.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Though it is possible to download the Linux operating system for
free from any number of Internet sites, in the 12 months ending in
May, Red Hat reported $12 million in revenues, most from selling
shrink-wrap versions of Linux for $39 and up. What the company adds
to the software is service and support. It also hopes to develop
refined Linux applications like word processing.
</P>
<P>
   With 67 million shares outstanding after its offering of 6
million shares, Red Hat finished the day with a valuation of around
$3.5 billion. Red Hat's co-founders, Robert Young and Marc Ewing,
each retain 14 percent of the company, according to the prospectus.

   Red Hat sold 55 percent of the commercial shipments of Linux in
1998, up from 42 percent in 1997, according to IDC. Still, many
questions remain about the profitability of the company and,
indeed, about the whole concept of marketing free software. Since
Linux cannot be copyrighted by any single distributor, it cannot be
licensed, so once people or companies purchase the system from Red
Hat, they can share it with whomever they choose, passing it from
desktop to desktop.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Bard, an analyst with Renaissance Capital in Greenwich,
Conn., which operates a mutual fund that invests in initial public
offerings, said that even if Red Hat were to become a popular
alternative to Microsoft, ``you can't compare the two companies
because Microsoft actually owns something.''
</P>
<P>
   But that reality did not dampen spirits here Wednesday. Tim
O'Reilly, founder and chief executive of O'Reilly &AMP; Associates, a
publisher of many popular books on open-source technology, said the
market response to Red Hat would attract more venture capital to
open-source development _ and probably more public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, O'Reilly said there remained a lingering
question about how the infusion of capital and attention from the
news media and investors would affect the passionate commitment of
the community of Linux developers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the first LinuxWorld Expo was held on the campus of
North Carolina State University, where exhibitors showed their
wares on portable card tables covered with blankets, and cocktail
parties were held in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   This week's LinuxWorld _ sponsored by IDG World Expo _ has the
aura of a big-time trade show, with neon signs, corporate booths
and marketing and public relations specialists around every corner.

SOLOMON DUTKA, 75, FOUNDER OF MARKETING RESEARCH FIRM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Solomon Dutka, who started a marketing research firm
in a one-room office here in 1953 that grew into one of the largest
companies in the industry, died Aug. 7 at his home in the Riverdale
section of the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Dutka, who was 75, was the chairman of Audits and Surveys
Worldwide, with operations in more than 90 countries. His death was
caused by complications from a stroke, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Dutka was born in the Bronx on Nov. 5, 1923, the son of a
tailor. He graduated from City College with degrees in mathematical
statistics and physics before joining the U.S. Army during World
War II. While in the armed forces, Dutka worked as a nuclear
physicist on the Manhattan Project, which earned him a citation
from the secretary of war for his efforts.
</P>
<P>
   He began his career in marketing research with a teaching
position at Columbia University. He became the chief statistician
at Dun &AMP; Bradstreet and Elmo Roper Associates before leaving to
start a business first called Audits and Surveys Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The company eventually grew into one of the most respected firms
of its type, representing clients like Coca-Cola Co. and Xerox
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Audits and Surveys became a publicly traded company in 1994 and
was acquired by the London-based United News Media earlier this
year. Dutka continued to serve as the chairman after the
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote books and articles on research methodologies and their
practical applications. In a 1996 commencement address to the
graduate school of Baruch College, he warned the new graduates of
the dangers of conventional thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Dutka served as an American statistical associate delegate to
the United Nations subcommittee on statistical sampling and was a
member of the United States Census Advisory Committee. He was a
fellow of the American Statistical Association and of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science.
</P>
<P>
   He was also a past president of the Market Research Council, a
trade group, which presented him with its 1984 Hall of Fame Award
for his contributions to the practice of market research.
</P>
<P>
   Dutka also served on the boards of Daytop Village, a narcotics
treatment center; the Neurosciences Institute, and numerous other
social, scientific, academic and cultural organizations.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Joyce; two sons, James of Santa
Monica, Calif., and Michael of Doylestown, Pa., and three stepsons,
David Fried of Montpelier, Vt.; Barry Fried of Makawao, Hawaii, and
Stephen Fried of New York.

BATTLEBOTS: BOXING ROBOTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After listening to two self-admitted geekish, nerdish
technobrats relate the endless virtues of robot combat the other
night, I swear I was ready to shed my innate hatred of high-tech
gizmos and actually join up with modern society.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an empowering experience for the participants and an
absolute thrilling experience for the spectators,'' says Ed (Trey)
Roski III, 34-year-old son of the wealthy Los Angeles business
mogul who's been heavily involved in L.A.'s attempt to land an NFL
expansion franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sport in which everyone from scientists from NASA to 12
year old girls from Madison, Wisconsin can compete,'' says Greg
Munson, 33-year-old first cousin of Trey Roski.
</P>
<P>
   Messrs. Roski and Munson are the promoters of this weekend's
BattleBots competition at The Pyramid in what promises to be
perhaps the most unusual, unique, bizarre, state-of-the art
mechanized, internet-dominated sporting event in the grand and
glorious history of Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sanctioned violence without anyone getting hurt
whatsoever except for the robots, of course,'' says Trey Roski.
``People who watch it become immediately addicted to it. It's
exciting and entertaining, absolutely never a dull moment. People
who build things, who are good with computers, who can fix
machinery especially like it. And what's great about it is that
people of all ages and vocations are into it.''
</P>
<P>
   But this spectacle apparently is not for those faint-hearted
machines unable to withstand the mayhem meted out by their rivals'
saws, spokes, drills, bits, hammers and tethered projectiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any weaponry goes except those with corrosives, explosives and
chemicals,'' says Roksi, who with Munson was a two-time world
champion in this pursuit until the two men decided to bring to
America an endeavor that has made an impact in Germany and England.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been an easy enterprise for the two doughty men.
</P>
<P>
   They've gone through a legal beef with the group doing business
in Europe that's cost them $500,000 in fees. And they've invested
$500,000 in this BattleBots inaugural Saturday and Sunday that will
feature a 50 by 50 foot ring fully enclosed by a 20-foot, bullet
proof glass wall.
</P>
<P>
   It's called a Battle Box and, according to Roski, its tab is a
cool $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it helps that Trey Roski's father is a billionaire,
and that he has the resources to spend more than $1 million to
stage a show that hasn't yet caught on with the sporting patrons in
these parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a trust fund from my grandfather and father, but it's
running a little low at the moment,'' says Roski. ``We've realized
from the start that this wasn't going to be a simple project for
us. Quite frankly, my father's skeptical. But I'm accustomed to
overcoming skepticism in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Roski never was supposed to even graduate from college,
but there he was in 1994 earning a degree in real estate finance
from Long Beach State.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me seven years, but I did it even though no one
thought I could,'' he says proudly.
</P>
<P>
   Trey Roski is dyslexic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a terrible reading disorder,'' he says. ``I'm just not
able to read anything. In college, I had everything read to me. The
way I have been able to take a lot of my tests is to memorize the
answers before I'd take them. I did that with my driving and
commercial pilot tests, as well as many in college.''
</P>
<P>
   Roski and Munson have both been into building and operating
gadgets since they were youngsters, and they feel it was a natural
progression for them to get into robots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was working in my dad's business (industrial warehouses)
after I got out of college and just didn't like it,'' says Roski.
``I've always been good with my hands, and Greg and I built a robot
that just kept winning. We immediately got hooked on the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Munson forsee a bright future for an activity that both
are committed to keeping as a pure sport, detached from the
scripted contrivances of professional wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why we and a lot of other people became disillusioned
with the group staging robot events in Europe,'' says Roski. ``They
were doing it as a game show, and the whole thing was being
choreographed. We want to keep it real, and we've already sold it
to a Pay-TV outlet for a show in Las Vegas in November. We're
planning to have five events this year, 12 next year and 30 in two
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the competition among principals in robotic warfare
is quite intense, with web page spying on the Internet a routine
occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone tries to get an edge,'' says Munson. ``People go to
great lengths to build these remote-control machines. Some cost as
much as $50,000. They spend a lot of time building them, tuning
them, experimenting with them and then rebuilding them after a
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be at least 75 robots in Long Beach this weekend, and
more than 150 people working the machines during the five-minute
matches in the three to four hour sessions that will be held twice
each day.
</P>
<P>
   Roski and Munson will exhibit their new creation, Ginsu, which
is battery-powered and maneuvers around on four 20-inch saw blade
wheels.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, they're not going to match him against such
feared motorized gladiators as Biohazard, Loch Nut Monster and
Nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure it's appropriate for the promoters to be directly
involved with the participants,'' says Roski, who obviously didn't
consult Don King on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   According to Roski and Munson, there usually is a clear cut
winner if both robots are still operating at the end of the time
limit, although the ultimate decision in such matches is decided by
the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowd actually serves as our judges,'' says Roski, an idea
that should be embraced by boxing in light of its numerous
abominable decisions. ``And I've never seen a crowd make a mistake
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, those who witness these robot clashes haven't come
under the dark influence of the WBC, WBA and IBF.

ANTHONY STANISLAS RADZIWILL, 40, AWARD-WINNING TV PRODUCER 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Anthony Stanislas Radziwill, a television executive
who received both Emmy and Peabody Awards, died Aug. 10 at New York
Presbyterian Hospital. He was 40 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Radziwill, the only son of Lee Bouvier Radziwill Ross and the
late Prince Stanislas Radziwill, had battled cancer for 10 years.
He was a close friend of his cousin, John F. Kennedy Jr., and each
had been best man at the other's wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Radziwill began his broadcasting career as an associate producer
at NBC Sports at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul and received his
first Emmy Award, for sports journalism. The next year he joined
ABC News as a producer on ``Prime Time Live'' with Diane Sawyer and
Sam Donaldson, specializing in investigative reporting. He worked
on reports of the Rodney King beating, the Los Angeles riots and
the O.J. Simpson trial.
</P>
<P>
   His investigative work on Neo-Nazism in the United States earned
him a Peabody Award in 1990. That same year, he won a second Emmy
Award for his work on ``Murder in Beverly Hills,'' a report on the
Menendez double homicide case.
</P>
<P>
   Radziwill joined Time Warner's Home Box Office in 1997 as vice
president for documentaries. He received a prime-time Emmy Award
for a documentary called ``Taxicab Confessions'' and received
Academy Award and Emmy Award nominations this year for ``Lenny
Bruce: Swear to Tell the Truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Radziwill, the nephew of President John F. Kennedy and
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who was his godmother, spent his
childhood in England with his parents. He received a bachelor's
degree in broadcast journalism from Boston University in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, the former Carole Di Falco; his
mother and his stepfather, Herbert Ross, and a sister, Anna
Christina Radziwill of Manhattan.

AMERICAN AND PILOTS SET ONE MORE MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   American Airlines and its pilots' union have agreed to another
meeting with a private mediator next week in a final attempt to end
a bitter dispute over American's integration of Reno Air.
</P>
<P>
   If left unresolved, the disagreement could lead to renewed labor
unrest at American, which is a division of the AMR Corp.n and is
the nation's second-largest airline.
</P>
<P>
   American and the Allied Pilots Association, which represents the
9,500 pilots at American, said Wednesday that they had agreed to
meet again on Monday at the behest of George Nicolau, the mediator
who has been seeking a settlement between the two sides since
March.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mediator George Nicolau has asked us to meet with APA next
week and we will do so out of deference to the mediator and the
process,'' said Robert W. Baker, executive vice president for
operations for American, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   But one person close to the talks said that American, which has
been increasingly frustrated by the negotiations, has said that it
needs to reach a deal within 24 hours. The union said in a message
to its members Wednesday that a special meeting of its board will
be held on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Talks fell apart over the weekend after the 18-person union
board modified a proposed settlement by Nicolau, which American had
previously approved. American said that the changes amounted to a
rejection of the proposed deal. Baker said again Wednesday that
American would move ahead with its integration of Reno Air, a small
carrier that flies mostly in the West, on Aug. 31, even if it did
not reach agreement with the union.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of the agreement remains intact,'' said Drew
Engelke, a spokesman for the union. ``We had some issues that
needed to be addressed and they knew that. They knew that until our
board ratified it, it was not a done deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Some pilots who are angry about the impasse have begun
discussing a possible new job action on Sept. 1, if a deal cannot
be reached. But that may be difficult since the union agreed in
court not to engage in any more disruptive protests after hundreds
of pilots called in sick in February, forcing American to cancel
nearly 6,700 flights.
</P>
<P>
   The sickout disrupted hundreds of thousands of travelers and
cost American $200 million before a federal judge ordered the
pilots back to work. He subsequently fined the union and its two
top officers $45.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The APA would not sanction anything like that,'' Engelke said,
referring to any new job action. ``We're committed too complying
with the judge's order.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilots became angry after AMR bought Reno Air in December
for $124 million. They contend that the deal violates the guarantee
in their contract that they do all the flying of large jets at
American. The union demanded that American immediately raise the
pay of Reno's 300 pilots as well as that of about 1,900 pilots at
American who will move up the ranks as a result of the acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side will say what changes the union made to the
proposed settlement. But the person close to the talks said that
the pilots reinserted language that would have had American tacitly
acknowledging that it was in violation of the pilot contract.
</P>
<P>
   The union board also abandoned a compromise that would have
given pilots temporarily laid off in 1993 and 1994 credit for half
the vacation time and pension benefits they lost. The board changed
the figure to 100 percent, which was its original negotiating
position, the person said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, the Department of Transportation reported that
in June American had the worst on-time performance and most
passenger complaints of any major domestic airline. A spokeswoman
for American said that the problems were a result of unusually bad
weather and the modernization of the government's air traffic
control system. She said that American did not detect any
disruption on the part of its pilots.

SPAIN'S TELEFONICA AND IDT SEEN IN DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J.)   (af)  
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Telefonica SA of Spain has agreed to form a wide-ranging joint
venture with the IDT Corp. to market telephone and Internet service
to Spanish speakers in the United States and Latin America,
executives close to the deal said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The companies plan to announce the venture Thursday, the
executives said. IDT declined to comment. A spokesman for
Telefonica could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Telefonica is Spain's dominant telecommunications carrier and
the biggest communications company in Latin America, with
operations in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, El Salvador,
Guatemala, Peru, Puerto Rico and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   But Telefonica does not have a major presence in the United
States and has not made major inroads selling services like prepaid
calling cards in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Niche marketing and product innovation are IDT's forte. Based in
Hackensack, N.J., IDT practically invented so-called call-back
technology, which allowed people in foreign countries to bypass the
high phone rates being charged by their local monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   IDT's Net2Phone unit, which is planning an initial public stock
offering, is generally considered the largest carrier of phone
calls using Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
   Much of IDT's business is in the prepaid calling card market and
about six months ago the company began marketing an Internet
service provider aimed at Hispanic users called Nuestra Voz (Our
Voice). IDT has struck a deal with Telemundo, the Spanish-language
television channel, to help market Nuestra Voz.
</P>
<P>
   Telefonica will own a bare majority of the joint venture,
according to people close to the deal. It will try to use IDT's
billing and customer relationship systems to provide stronger
prepaid calling card offerings in Latin America and perhaps prepaid
cellular service.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the venture may try to link IDT's Nuestra
Voz Internet service with Telefonica's Ole! Web portal service.
Telefonica is facing challenges on the Web from Starmedia Network
Inc. and Quepasa.com Inc., both of which are developing
Spanish-language Web services.
</P>
<P>
   Starmedia and Quepasa are initially focused on the United States
but appear to be considering expanding into Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   IDT intends to invest about $10 million in the venture
initially, executives close to the deal said, though that figure
could increase sharply if the venture's first initiatives succeed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the joint venture, IDT has also agreed to acquire
10 percent of a project begun by Telefonica to lay an underwater
fiber optic communications cable around Latin America, executives
close to the agreement said. The cable, which will include
connections from Chile to the United States, is meant to be
completed in a few years at a cost of about $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   IDT's investment will be somewhat less than $150 million,
however, because some of the $1.5 billion will be raised through
debt financing, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   IDT has also agreed to buy at least $100 million worth of
communications services from the overall undersea cable venture
over five years, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   While Telefonica's deal with IDT could expand its presence in
the United States, it is bound to raise questions about
Telefonica's relationship with MCI Worldcom Inc., the No. 2 United
States long-distance carrier, with which it has a strategic
partnership. It is unclear how Telefonica intends to reconcile that
partnership with forming a venture with IDT partly to win customers
in the United States.

<P>
   Milan Panic, the former prime minister of Yugoslavia who in
recent months has devoted himself months to toppling President
Slobodan Milosovic, has been charged with fraudulently misleading
investors in ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc., the company he runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission said in a complaint filed
in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Wednesday that ICN failed
to notify investors promptly that its application to market a drug
called Ribavarin to treat hepatitis C had been rejected by the Food
and Drug Administration. For two and a half months after the FDA
rejected its application in November 1994, ICN issued statements
that misled the public about the status of the application, the SEC
said in its complaint.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Panic, who serves as ICN's president and
chairman, the SEC charged former ICN executive vice president Nils
Johannesson and ICN general counsel David Watt. The complaint seeks
civil penalties from each of the defendants and also seeks to bar
Panic from serving as an officer or director of a publicly traded
company.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for ICN, based in Costa Mesa, Calif., did not return
a telephone call seeking comment. A lawyer for Panic said earlier
that Panic intended to contest any SEC charges.
</P>
<P>
   Panic, a native of Serbia, took time off from running ICN in in
the early 1990s to serve as prime minister of Yugoslavia. Panic,
69, has visited European capitals in recent weeks to rally
opposition against Milosovic. His name is sometimes mentioned as a
possible future leader of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ICN's business operations have suffered because of the war in
Kosovo and economic difficulties in Russia, where it has
operations. The company also took a $230 million write-off on its
Belgrade subsidiary, which the Yugoslavian government seized in
February. Panic has lobbied in Washington to get United States
support for reclaiming that plant.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of ICN rose $1.125 Wednesday, to $19.3125. They have
slumped 35 percent this month.
</P>
<P>
   Panic and ICN have had conflicts with the SEC before. In 1991,
Panic, ICN and Viratech Inc., a subsidiary, settled SEC charges of
making false statements without admitting or denying the
allegations. &QL;

Barr resigns from Rockets
<TEXT>

 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
The Rockets lost one of their key player strategists Wednesday when
Robert Barr resigned, ending 15 years with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Barr, the Rockets' senior executive vice president for
basketball affairs the past three seasons, left his position to
step away from the demands of the position and spend time with his
family.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich and executive vice
president for basketball Carroll Dawson, Barr was responsible for
player acquisitions and related decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Barr also was responsible for the Rockets' basketball operations
staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert and I had a very close relationship, much more than
business,'' Tomjanovich said. ``I consider the guy like my brother,
and he's been in this organization for a very long time on many
different levels. He's contributed so much. You couldn't put into
words how much. He's a people person. He had very close ties with
players, coaches and people in the office.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr had been considering the move for several weeks and flew to
Florida last week to meet with Rockets owner Leslie Alexander, who
attempted to convince Barr not to resign, a source close to the
talks said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Barr nor Alexander was available for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Barr's departure is the second by a key member of the Rockets
basketball staff in as many days. Assistant coach Bill Berry
resigned Tuesday to accept a similar deal with the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich said no decisions had been made about replacing
Barr.
</P>
<P>
   Barr had been director of player development for four seasons
before moving to his most recent position. A 1980 graduate of Peru
State (Neb.) College, where he was a three-year starter, he had
been the team's strength and conditioning coach, one of the first
full-time strength coaches in the NBA, for eight seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to leave a void,'' Tomjanovich said. ``He did a lot
of different things, a lot of it in interpersonal relationships,
being a person to listen and to address concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something we had talked about over the last several
weeks for many hours about his decision. I really didn't want him
to leave. He did talk about some issues like health and family. You
reach a point you have to back off and let a man make a decision.
We had been together such a long time, it won't be the same.''

EDITORIAL: REPUBLICANS AND THE GAY VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Aug. 12:
</P>
<P>
   Gay men and lesbians may be born homosexual, but they aren't
born Democrats. They have often voted that way, however, because
the national Republican Party has been so hostile. Now, in the ebb
of the great cultural wars mounted by conservatives for the last
two decades, that seems to be changing. The most prominent
Republican candidates for president in the next election, as
Katharine Seelye reported Wednesday in The Times, are taking
positions that are ``subtly but fundamentally more inviting'' to
gay and lesbian voters than at any time before.
</P>
<P>
   Some, boiled down, are not all that subtle. Texas Gov. George W.
Bush Jr. has said he would have no qualms hiring homosexuals.
Elizabeth Dole has declared that she would not turn away money from
a gay Republican group, as her husband did in the 1996 campaign.
The plain-spoken Sen. John McCain said he could envision a gay
president someday. But even the more subtle changes in the
candidate field are remarkable. When asked how he would react if
one of his children were homosexual, former Vice President Dan
Quayle, the standard-bearer of the religious right, said he would
be supportive ``whatever they are.'' The pugnacious Patrick
Buchanan, who declared ``a cultural war'' aimed squarely at
homosexuals from the podium of the Republican National Convention
in 1992, has not made the subject an issue this year.
</P>
<P>
   That represents a sea change. It was the Republican Party that
first turned anti-homosexual attitudes into a political weapon. It
was among Republicans in the Senate in the McCarthy era that the
witch hunt for homosexuals in government and the military began. It
was President Dwight Eisenhower who signed the executive order
making homosexuality grounds for rejection or dismissal from
federal employment, a directive that J. Edgar Hoover's FBI, local
police and local Republicans and Democrats alike turned into a
decades-long hunt. It was the television preachers of the religious
right, reacting against the gay rights movement in the 1970s, who
began to set the social agenda for the modern Republican Party 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The height of their influence came with Pat Buchanan's and Pat
Robertson's speeches at the Republican Convention in 1992, but that
spring Bill Clinton reached out to homosexuals in a single
appearance at a gay fund-raiser in Hollywood. No nominee had done
that before, and the opposing party views produced a national gay
vote for the first time in the 1992 presidential election. It went
Democratic, and in states like Georgia, which Clinton won by only
16,000 votes, it may have been decisive.
</P>
<P>
   Republican oratory has been growing more moderate ever since. In
Congress, where Republicans like Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
of Mississippi, have solid fundamentalist voter bases back home,
mean-spirited talk about homosexuals has continued. But Ralph Reed,
president of the Christian Coalition until last year, never made
homosexuals a national campaign issue after 1992.
</P>
<P>
   There are still 15 months for this new tolerance to be tested.
But for now it is refreshing to listen to the voice of an important
preacher in the Republican Party, Rich Tafel, an ordained American
Baptist minister and the head of the national gay Log Cabin
Republicans. For years, he and other gay Republicans have been
feeling unwanted. Now, he says, ``the tone has totally changed.''
</P>
<P>
   That may not be music to the ears of Democrats like Vice
President Al Gore, who has spent years being friendly to
homosexuals. But after half a century of jeers and police whistles,
it is a hopeful sound indeed.

CLINTON TO COMMUTE RADICALS' SENTENCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Under continued pressure from minority politicians
and human rights activists, President Clinton Wednesday agreed to
commute the sentences of 16 members of a Puerto Rican nationalist
group that was involved in more than 100 bombings of political and
military installations in the United States at least 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 16 were convicted of crimes like seditious
conspiracy, possession of an unregistered firearm or interstate
transportation of a stolen vehicle. Yet some were sentenced to more
than 50 years in jail, a length of time that the president viewed
as excessive, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Most have already served at least 19 years. One was sentenced to
90 years and has served nearly 25 years and the others have served
at least 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president feels they deserved to serve serious sentences
for these crimes but not sentences that were far out of proportion
to the nature of the crimes they were convicted for,'' Barry Toiv,
a White House spokesman, said Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The president imposed conditions on the commutations, requiring
each person to renounce the use of violence and agree to comply
with normal parole requirements. Eleven would be released from
prison immediately, two would have to serve additional time, and
three would have their fines waived.
</P>
<P>
   One of their friends is not being offered clemency because of
the seriousness of the crimes of which he was convicted and his
continued advocacy of violence.
</P>
<P>
   The nationalist group, known as the FALN, which are the Spanish
initials for Armed Forces of National Liberation, was dedicated to
the independence of Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1974 and 1983, law enforcement officials attributed at
least 130 bombings to the FALN and branded it a terrorist
organization. It killed six people and wounded scores more, but
those whose sentences the president wants to commute were not
directly involved in the deaths and injuries, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   It was other Puerto Rican nationalists who were convicted of
storming the United States House of Representatives in 1954 and
wounding five lawmakers. Former President Jimmy Carter pardoned
four of those nationalists in 1977 and 1979. He also pardoned a
fifth who had been convicted of plotting to kill President Truman
in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Carter was among human rights leaders who urged Clinton to
release these 16. Other leaders calling for their release included
retired South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Coretta Scott King,
Cardinal John O'Connor of the Archidocese of New York, the Right
Rev. Paul Moore Jr., the retired bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of
New York, and several Democratic lawmakers from New York, including
Reps. Jose E. Serrano, Charles B. Rangel, Nydia M. Velazquez and
Eliot L. Engel.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said that Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has
all but declared her candidacy for the Senate from New York, had
nothing to do with the commutation, which had been in the works
long before she indicated her interest in the election. However,
the decision could accrue to her political benefit by cementing her
relationship with New York's large Puerto Rican community.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some law enforcement officials have said that
the nationalists should have been given stiffer sentences, and the
commutations could hurt Mrs. Clinton among the law-and-order
advocates who support her likely Republican opponent, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani of New York City.

SPORTS COLUMN: MILLIONS FOR CHARITY, ZERO FOR PROS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Mass.)   (bl)  
 By DAVE ANDERSON  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ They sound like weekend golfers haggling on the
first tee over handicap strokes and the wagers. No way you get
three a side. And if you're 2 down, a press is automatic.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Ryder Cup matches approach, these golfers are
haggling over millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   When the U.S. pros try to recapture the Ryder Cup from the
European team at The Country Club outside Boston Sept. 24-26, the
matches will generate more than $70 million, with a net income of
about $20 million to the Professional Golfers Association of
America, according to Jim Awtrey, its chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   But the 12 American golfers, notably Tiger Woods and David
Duval, each will be compensated with only a $5,000 stipend, as each
of the pros were in other recent Ryder Cup matches.
</P>
<P>
   In those years before the rise of the Ryder Cup rivalry created
the current bonanza, the golfers were playing for pride and
country. But with all those millions now, it's not right for the
golfers to get what amounts to a tip for their caddies.
</P>
<P>
   Woods and Duval have been outspoken that each Ryder Cup golfer
deserves the same substantial fee.
</P>
<P>
   Not for their own bank accounts, Woods and Duval insist, but to
donate to their personal charity. They not only are requesting
what's right, they're also doing the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   Each one of the 12 American golfers deserves, say, $250,000,
with the stipulation that they declare which charity they would be
playing for in the matches. This way they would still be playing
free, and for pride and country, while also playing for charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, personally,'' Woods has said, ``I would donate all of
it to charity.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval talked about taking the money ``to benefit where we
live,'' meaning his Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., community. And
according to Tim Finchem, the PGA Tour commissioner, each of the 16
golfers in the Ryder Cup meeting Tuesday ``made it clear they had
no interest or desire or request to be compensated'' for competing
in the September matches.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, U.S. captain Ben Crenshaw was openly critical of
two golfers who were in the Tuesday meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm personally disappointed in a couple people in that
meeting, and they know who they are,'' Crenshaw said. ``Whether
some players like it or not, there are some people who came before
them that mean a hell of a lot to this game. And it burns the hell
out of me to listen to some of their viewpoints.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw later hinted that Duval, who has called the Ryder Cup
matches an exhibition, could be one. The other might be Mark
O'Meara, who suggested two years ago that the players be paid, or
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   But if playing for charity is doing the right thing, it's now up
to the PGA of America to do the right thing. According to Awtrey,
``we'll have a plan to address this by the end of the year,'' but
when asked if it would be applied retroactively, he said, ``I don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   This dispute involves the PGA of America, which governs the 81st
PGA Championship that starts here Thursday at the Medinah Country
Club, as distinct from both the PGA Tour, which conducts the weekly
tour events, and the U.S. Golf Association, which holds the U.S.
Open.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 60 years after the Ryder Cup matches began in 1927,
the U.S. teams of Walter Hagen, Ben Hogan and Jack Nicklaus
invariably dominated. And there was no television money, no
corporate hospitality tents, no marketing millions.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Europeans, stirred by Spain's Seve Ballesteros,
snatched the cup in 1985, the biennial competition has grown into a
financial bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   With most of the European profits going to the British PGA,
golfers from Spain, Germany and Sweden have also complained that
not enough went to their respective national organizations.
</P>
<P>
   But the PGA of America and the PGA Tour may have already opened
the door to the touring pros forming a union.
</P>
<P>
   That union idea floated briefly last year, then seemed to
disappear. Somewhere a labor leader could be thinking about
organizing the touring pros.
</P>
<P>
   And if a touring pros' union ever develops, the PGA of America
will have only itself to blame for not having anticipated this
Ryder Cup squabble before all the haggling started on the first
tee. &QL;

 S.F. Fed President Hints Increase in Rates  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Bob Parry is starting to get nervous that inflation could pick up
again. And when he gets nervous, you should get nervous, too.
<P>
   Parry, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San
Francisco, said in a speech to a group of female real estate
executives yesterday that the strong domestic economy combined with
improving conditions abroad suggest ``there are risks for future
U.S. inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Fed chief, like other Fed officials, never
says what interest-rate policy he favors. But his comments on
inflation were a strong &UR;  &LR; signal that he will support a tighter
stance when the Federal Reserve's rate-setting committee meets in
12 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sounds like the guy wants to raise interest rates,'' said Gary
Schlossberg, an economist with Wells Capital Management.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed boosted short-term interest rates 0.25 percentage point
when in met in June, and Schlossberg thinks it will do so again
later this month and once more in October. That would effectively
undue the three rate cuts the Fed pushed through last year in the
face of collapsing financial markets in Asia, Brazil and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents of the 12 regional Fed banks vote on monetary policy
on a rotating basis and Parry won't get to vote again until next
year. But he still takes part in meetings of the Fed's rate-setting
committee and can voice his opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Parry has long been known as an inflation hawk wary that fast
economic growth could push up prices. But in recent years, he, like
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, has said that rising
worker productivity allows the economy to grow at a more rapid pace
without triggering inflation.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of FED12 (82157 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  In his speech yesterday, Parry noted that inflation news so far
has been good. In fact, consumer prices in the United States rose
only at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the first half of this
year and only at a 1.6 percent rate if volatile food and energy
prices are excluded.
</P>
<P>
   But he cited a tight job market, low unemployment rates, high
levels of consumer demand and stronger foreign markets as factors
that could cause U.S. prices to rise at a faster pace.
</P>
<P>
   Recent economic data show that U.S. workers are starting to see
faster wage gains, a reversal of a two-decade trend during which
wage earners lost ground. While that may be welcome news to many,
some economists worry that wage pressures could push up prices.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Parry said, the increasing productiveness of U.S.
workers have kept inflationary pressures in check. But the Fed
isn't sure what's behind the productivity gains and whether they
will continue in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increases in wages are good, but they have to be in line with
what's happening with productivity,'' he said in remarks to
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Parry said the Bay Area resisted the effects of
Asia's economic crisis last year, thanks to the strength of the
region's technology industry which created jobs at a double-digit
annual rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Job creations remains solid overall,'' he said, noting that
area unemployment has dropped about half a percentage point so far
this year to about 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The only sign of a slowdown locally is coming from commercial
and residential real estate, where the torrid pace of construction
has started to slow as mortgage interest rates have risen.

YOUNG GUNMAN AT GEORGIA HIGH SCHOOL WILL BE TRIED AS AN ADULT 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONYERS, Ga. _ As his schoolmates went back to classes Thursday,
15-year-old T.J. Solomon learned he would be tried as an adult for
the May 20 shooting of six students at Heritage High School here.
</P>
<P>
   The trial decision, by Judge William Schneider of Juvenile
Court, came after two and a half days of hearings that focused on
the question of the teenager's psychological state before, during
and after his firing a .22-caliber rifle into a commons area as
about 150 students waited for the school day to begin. Those 12
shots wounded six students.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting occurred exactly a month after two teenagers, Eric
Harris and Dylan Klebold, killed 12 students, a teacher and
themselves at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. Agents from
the Georgia Bureau of Investigation found a letter under Solomon's
bed in which he associated himself with the ``trench coat mafia,''
a group of socially alienated Columbine High students that included
the gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of Judge Schneider's decision, the Solomon youth
will face 21 felony charges when tried in Rockdale County Superior
Court. If convicted on all counts, he could face up to 351 years in
prison. In a juvenile-court trial, conviction on those same charges
would bring a maximum sentence of five years.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia law required that one of three standards be met for the
trial to remain in juvenile court: evidence of mental retardation,
reasonable grounds that the defendant may not be guilty or findings
that the accused suffered from mental illness. State law defines
mental illness as not knowing right from wrong or being severely
detached from reality.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers did not contend that Solomon was mentally
retarded or that he was not the gunman, but they did argue that he
was mentally ill because he was infatuated with self-destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Schneider said that while he was sure the defendant had
emotional problems, he was not convinced the boy was mentally ill
under the state's definition. ``The fact that the child has
attempted to copy a heinous and devastating crime through
premeditation makes these actions even more egregious and
outrageous,'' he said.

 _ SF CHRON   Think the Examiner Is Headed for the Scrap Heap? Think Again 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The conventional wisdom holds that Hearst Corp. won't find a buyer
for the San Francisco Examiner and will just fold up the paper.
<P>
   I'm not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   I'm rooting for the ``Monarch of the Dailies'' to stick around
and give The Chronicle _ the venerable ``Voice of the West'' _ a
run for its money.
</P>
<P>
   It could happen.
</P>
<P>
   The Ex, which was William Randolph Hearst's first newspaper, is
now on the block because Hearst's namesake corporation has agreed
to buy The Chronicle. To preserve multiple voices in what the
Examiner always refers to as The City, the federal government
usually requires someone in Hearst's shoes to sell one of its
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst is selling the Examiner name, its staff and its
circulation list (and its comics, for anyone who wonders where
Dilbert and Zippy the Pinhead wind up in all this chaos).
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, whoever buys the Examiner had better have access to a
building to house the staff, a printing press and a fleet of
trucks, to say nothing of an ad sales force. All of those features
still belong to Hearst and aren't going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst isn't saying how much money it wants. ``I don't think
there's an asking price,'' said Tim White, publisher of the
Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company is presented in all of its naked glory. Somebody
says, `That's worth X to me _ I'll make a bid.''' Hearst is taking
three to six weeks to solicit offers for the paper.
</P>
<P>
   In the days since Hearst's announcement, the Examiner's demise
has been forecast with certainty, as the media companies seen as
the most likely bidders have publicly shied away.
</P>
<P>
   William Dean Singleton, whose Alameda Newspaper Group publishes
newspapers in San Mateo and the East Bay, said, ``Emphatically,
no,'' when asked if he wanted to buy the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Ridder, the chief honcho at Knight Ridder _ a large chain
whose San Jose Mercury News and Contra Costa Times encircle the
city _ says he doesn't want those parts of the Examiner that Hearst
is selling.
</P>
<P>
   But what about Ted Fang, publisher of the San Francisco
Independent, a neighborhood newspaper?
</P>
<P>
   David Cole, a former Examiner assistant managing editor and now
editor and publisher of NewsInc., a biweekly newsletter on the
business of newspapers, sees some potential there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does make sense for somebody, but there's only one
somebody: the Fang family,'' Cole said. ``They have printing
presses and trucks ... and a history of influencing San Francisco
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The Independent publishes local neighborhood news three times a
week. It has a free circulation of 209,150 in San Francisco,
delivered door-to-door and at news racks. It also owns eight San
Mateo publications.
</P>
<P>
   The paper has become a force in the city since the Fang family's
Pan Asia Ventures bought a small weekly in the Lake Merced
neighborhood in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The Examiner's 114,776 daily circulation would fit nicely with
the Independent's, and the paper _ which already picked up Warren
Hinckle from the Ex _ would gain a talented stable of writers. And
it could take the Examiner to morning circulation.
</P>
<P>
   (Hinckle, for his part, offered a few fun scenarios in his
Independent column this week: Rupert Murdoch could buy the
Examiner; or how about the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, who's already a
newspaper publisher with the Washington Times?)
</P>
<P>
   Cole said Fang needs to answer a question: ``Do you want to
carve out a little advertising niche from the behemoth, or do you
want to go head to head with the behemoth?'' Now they've got the
niche; we'll see if they want the war.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Fang, publisher of the Independent, is keeping mum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no comment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But an editorial in the Independent on Tuesday suggested that
Hearst's effort to sell the paper without all its assets was a sham
to convince the Department of Justice that it was trying to
preserve newspaper competition in the city. Selling the Examiner
without the infrastructure is a ``phony effort,'' the editorial
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fang isn't the only potential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps an Internet media company could snap it up.
</P>
<P>
   Two that immediately spring to mind are MarketWatch.com and
Salon.com, both run by Examiner alumni.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, neither is interested. ``How stupid do I look?'' asked
MarketWatch CEO Larry Kramer. ``I reach 10 times that many people
now.''
</P>
<P>
   A Salon exec, who asked not to be named, was similarly
incredulous: ``We should go back to an economy that we thought was
a little expensive? We should go back to buying printing presses
and backshops and things like that?''
</P>
<P>
   If they don't want it, though, perhaps someone else has some
creative ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Like Michael Tchong.
</P>
<P>
   Tchong, who founded MacWeek (a San Francisco computer magazine
with a long successful run before its demise earlier this year),
now heads up Iconocast, an Internet marketing newsletter. He has
long fantasized about starting up a daily called Alta California.
</P>
<P>
   Like a true Net entrepreneur, Tchong doesn't want the name or
the staff. He doesn't care that the printing press isn't part of
the deal. ``I am strongly opposed to getting any physical
properties whatsoever,'' he said. He just wants the circulation
list: the 600,000 people who buy the combined Sunday paper every
week.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is cagey on what exactly he'd do, Tchong said he
would use the U.S. Postal Service for delivery and would publish
more than just weekly _ but not every day.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite scenario has William Randolph Hearst III riding in
to buy the Examiner. After all, Will was publisher of the Ex before
he split for Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Now a partner at the venture firm Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield &AMP;
Byers, Hearst has the wherewithal and the interest to snap up his
grandfather's flagship.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't return my calls.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SODDEN THOUGHT: There's only one writer who could have put Hearst's
purchase of its longtime rival The Chronicle into proper
perspective: Herb Caen.
</P>
<P>
   The late, legendary columnist, who jumped to the Examiner in
1950 but jumped back to The Chronicle eight years later, once
printed an item dispelling the merger rumors that frequently
swirled around the two papers.
</P>
<P>
   The item, sent in by reader P.J. Corkery, quoted from a Page One
Examiner report: ``The statement that the Examiner had been sold to
the proprietor of The Chronicle is ... emphatically denied. Mr.
Hearst has not sold the Examiner and has no intention of doing
so.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That appeared on Nov. 11, 1886,'' Caen wrote, concluding,
``Moral: Do not pay attention to idle gossip.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MOVES AROUND THE BAY: Jeff O'Brien, the editor of Marketing
Computers, will be moving across town to Wired, where he'll be a
senior editor. O'Brien was well known in tech journalist circles
for his annual list of ``The Influencers,'' the most powerful
technology journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Cyberscribes used to take O'Brien to lunch to impress him with
their intellect. Now, he said, he'll find out whether they lunched
with him because they liked him or just because they were buttering
him up.
</P>
<P>
   On this year's list, O'Brien didn't rank Wired editor Katrina
Heron among the top of all tech journalists, but she squeaked into
the top 10 of magazine editors.

 The Young's Big Effect on Internet  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
It's official: Younger people are having a big impact on the
Internet's customs and values.
<P>
   Forrester Research, the Cambridge, Mass., outfit that cranks out
studies on how the Net is changing the world, revealed in its
latest report yesterday that nearly 10 percent of the U.S.
population is now aged between 16 and 22, and about half are
online.
</P>
<P>
   With $37 billion in personal income and influence over $62
billion more in adult spending, these 12.4 million young online
consumers are the first ``Net-powered generation,'' Forrester says.
</P>
<P>
   The crux is that while older Americans merely have made the
Internet a part of established routines, plucky youngsters have
``internalized'' information technology and made it an intrinsic
part of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a watershed for the Internet,'' said James McQuivey, a
Forrester analyst. ``When a generation of consumers internalizes a
technology, its dissemination becomes self-sustaining and
pervasive.''
</P>
<P>
   Forrester believes that younger users, with all the billions of
dollars they either directly or indirectly control, ``will
ultimately reshape the economy'' by asserting their rights as
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester has come up with five ``Net rules'' reflecting the
beliefs of these mighty techno-youths:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; _Information is everywhere.  &LR; In other words, ready access to
information is a right.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; _Personal information has value.  &LR; Marketers must be ready to give
something back in return for personal data.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; _Choice is a human right.  &LR; If it can't be reconfigured, it won't
sell.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; _There is no such thing as a free lunch.  &LR; Marketers must give away
freebies to attract the attention of consumers (see rule two).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; _Building trust doesn't require face-to-face interaction.  &LR; This
goes without saying for a group that lives via e-mail and instant
messaging.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester said it reached its conclusions after interviewing
almost 8,500 16- to 22-year-olds throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, however, accepts these findings as authoritative.
Ann Wrixon, president of San Francisco's SeniorNet, an association
of more than 30,000 computer-using adults ages 50 and older, was
quick to observe that the number of senior citizens online easily
matches the number of teens.
</P>
<P>
   As of last year, she said, 13 million older folk were wired.
</P>
<P>
   ``That number is at least 16 million now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people have had a tremendous influence, but it's a total
myth that they're having the most influence,'' Wrixon said.
``Seniors spend more time online than any other demographic group,
and they spend more money online.''
</P>
<P>
   The clout of the Net-powered generation notwithstanding, she
said ``seniors are shaping how the Internet is formed because of
their buying power.''

 IPOs Lose Their Luster  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
With the stock market stumbling, especially among Internet and
other high-tech issues, the once torrid market for initial public
offerings has suddenly gone tepid.
<P>
   Internet stock indexes are now down more than 20 percent since
the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   The harsh market conditions have caused scores of startups to
rush to get their IPOs launched, even if it has meant selling fewer
shares at a lower price and raising less capital.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-three companies were scheduled to have their shares priced
this week, according to ipoPros.com. That compares with 31 last
week and 33 the week before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are shoveling out deals to get them done before the
IPO window closes,'' said Ben Holmes, founder of ipoPros, a
Boulder, Colo, research firm.
</P>
<P>
   The heightened activity is unusual for this time of the year.
``After July 4, the investment bankers, attorneys, printers and
everyone else go on vacation. But this year, there were so many
deals and so much demand they couldn't walk away from the table,''
noted Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   The IPO market is far from dead. Investors have just become much
more discriminating in what they choose to put their money in.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, for example, Red Hat Inc., the Durham, N.C.,
distributor of Linux operating systems, more than tripled, shooting
from its $14 offering price to $52.06.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Blockbuster Inc., the Dallas video rental
giant, sold 31 million shares at $15, $1 below the estimated
$16-to-$18 range before the sale. Its shares closed flat yesterday
at $15.
</P>
<P>
   Also yesterday, Mortgage.com of Plantation, Fla., harvested
about $20 million less than planned after selling 7 million shares
instead of 7.5 million and lowering the price from the $10-to-$12
range to $8.
</P>
<P>
   Several other companies such as HotJobs.com of New York and
Braun Consulting of Chicago took similar action on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Medscape of New York and Garden.com of Austin, Texas,
postponed their IPOs yesterday until market conditions improve.
Several Bay Area companies, including Women.com Networks of San
Mateo and Bamboo.com of Palo Alto, have taken similar actions in
the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   IPO Monitor senior analyst Gail Bronson figures that it could be
a while before new Internet issues take off as a class as they did
this past spring. Some established Web giants like America Online,
eBay and Amazon.com have lost about half their value since April.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simply a case of deal fatigue,'' said Frank Quattrone,
head of the Technology Group of Credit Suisse First Boston, one of
the leading IPO underwriters. ``There are a lot of new issues in
the marketplace and when some of these IPOs stopped giving
investors a big pop, it started taking a toll.''
</P>
<P>
   There are still about 330 U.S. companies that have registered
plans for public offerings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. ``But the pipeline is less than it was,'' said Holmes
of ipoPros.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, 292 U.S. companies have launched their public
offerings, and their average gain from offering price is nearly 30
percent, according to IPO Monitor. The 60 Northern California IPOs,
more than one-fifth of the total, did even better: The average gain
was 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But unless you were among the lucky few who were able to get
shares of hot IPOs at their offering price, the chances are you did
not make a killing. In fact, if you bought shares of new companies
after trading began, it is likely you may have lost money.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 Northern California companies that have gone public since
July 20 have gained an average of 25.1 percent from their offering
price. That's not bad considering the jittery market for
high-flying high-tech stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But if you track IPO performance from the first trade, when
those granted shares at the offering price begin to unload their
holdings for instant financial gratification, these same stocks
have lost an average of 15.9 percent in value.
</P>
<P>
   Just two stocks are trading above their opening prices, while 11
are lower. Consider Gadzoox, the San Jose company that makes
high-speed Internet access gear. It has jumped 230.4 percent from
its offering price and is counted among the top 10 first-day IPO
gainers this year.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Gadzoox closed at $69.375, down 3.6 percent from its
opening trading price of $72 on July 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to be careful,'' advises IPO investor Kraigcq &LR; 
Rudinger, president of Attilatech, a Foster City e-commerce
software company. ``There are a lot of turkeys out there if you buy
shares once trading begins like I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the IPOs that Rudinger has invested in like Insweb and
MP3 are down more than 50 percent from what he bought them for. He
said he has used, and recommends using, stop loss orders and puts
and calls to lessen the risk of Internet investing.

 COMPUTING Q&AMP;A/DAVID EINSTEIN  &HT;     Telling Windows Apart 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Q: I just bought a used computer, which first was sold in 1995. I
think it has had a few upgrades to the operating system, but I'm
not sure. Would you please tell me how to find out what version of
Windows 95 I am running? Also, which version is the latest?
<P>
   A: There are two basic versions of Windows 95: the original one
and a secondary release called OSR2. OSR2 was never available in
retail stores _ it was sold only to PC-makers, who put it on new
computers starting in autumn of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how to determine which version is on your machine: Open
the Windows Control Panel by clicking Start, then Settings, then
Control Panel. Double-click the System icon, then click the General
tab. You'll find the Windows version under System. If the version
number ends with the letter B, you have OSR2. Otherwise, you have
the original Windows 95. OSR2 offered enhanced support for hard
disks larger than 2 gigabytes, as well as some bug fixes and other
minor improvements.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Linux Lowdown
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm intrigued by all the buzz about Linux, and I'd like to
give it a try, but I have a few questions. First, can I install it
on a computer that's already running Windows 98? And how difficult
is it to install and use?
</P>
<P>
   A: Assuming that you have enough space on your hard drive, you
can install Linux on your Windows PC.
</P>
<P>
   The only catch is that first you'll have to partition the hard
drive. This creates an area on the drive that can be used by Linux
file formats, which are different from the formats used by Windows.
But don't fret.
</P>
<P>
   Shrink-wrapped Linux programs from Red Hat, Caldera and
Macmillan all come with fairly easy to use partitioning programs.
They also let you set up your PC so you can start it with Windows
or Linux. (You can't switch systems once the computer is going.)
</P>
<P>
   A Linux installation takes up anywhere from several hundred
megabytes to more than 1 gigabyte of disk space, depending on how
many applications and utility programs you want to add.

   Don't expect Linux to be as easy to use as Windows. It's quickly
becoming a point-and-click operating system, but you still will
need to know some Unix commands to take advantage of it.
Fortunately, there's a plethora of information about Linux on the
Web. Check out the Linux Documentation Project link at

Backups and CD-RW
</P>
<P>
   I recently installed a CD-Rewriteable drive in my year-old
350-MHz Windows 98 computer, and it works fine. I began to use the
new drive to back up my hard disk, and that also seems to work.
</P>
<P>
   My question is, does the verify cycle of the backup work
correctly when writing to a CD-RW disc? When using magnetic tape, I
can mentally picture that a backup error is being overwritten with
correct data on the tape. But does this type of error correction
also take place when using a CD-RW?
</P>
<P>
   A: If your backup software is designed to be able to work with
CDs, you should be fine. A CD-RW, which can be erased and reused,
will let you archive information just as you would on a hard disk
or floppy. But be sure to use CD-RWs and not CD-Rs, which are
read-only discs that can't be erased and rewritten. (They're just
like music CDs that way.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Finding the Printer
</P>
<P>
   Q: I just upgraded to Windows 98. With Windows 95, I could print
draft pages on my HP printer by clicking on File/Print/Properties
and selecting Econofast. I can't find this option with Windows 98,
or maybe I'm not looking in the right place. Help.
</P>
<P>
   A: Sounds like the software utility for your HP printer somehow
was disabled when you installed Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   What you want to do is reinstall the software that came with
your printer. If you don't have the software, you can download it
from HP's Web site at www.hp.com. That should restore your
Econofast option.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIP OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   How would you like a way to increase the size of your screen
when you're surfing the Web? Well, there is a way to do it _ sort
of _ in Microsoft Internet Explorer. With the browser open, press
the F11 function key. This will expand the Web page to fill the
screen, eliminating the title bar and menu bar at the top of the
screen and the status bar and Windows taskbar bar at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   You'll still have the navigation bar, which lets you go
backward, forward, home, etc. To add an address space to that bar,
right-click any empty area of the bar and select Address Bar. Oh
yeah, to return the screen to its original format, press F11 again.

 _ SF CHRON  
 On the Information Superhypeway, You Can't Always Take Web News  at
Face Value 
 &HT;     By Dan Fost  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Investors and others who are turning to the Web for financial news
need to read the fine print: Sometimes that news headline really
leads to a company's press release.
<P>
   Web sites run by companies like Yahoo, Snap and ExciteAtHome run
news from independent journalists right alongside corporate press
releases that give a boosterish perspective on a company's news.
</P>
<P>
   Although the source of a story is usually labeled, some readers
may not realize that Associated Press or Reuters are independent
news organizations that attempt to get all sides of a story,
whereas Business Wire and PR Newswire charge companies to
distribute their press releases verbatim.
</P>
<P>
   Today, few newspapers or magazines run press releases at all, so
many readers aren't used to seeing unfiltered hype sitting next to
news.
</P>
<P>
   On the Web, press releases and news stories sit cheek by jowl,
with similar headlines in the same font and type size.
</P>
<P>
   While this may be confusing for readers, for a public relations
professional, or a company looking to hype its latest announcement,
the Web is a dream come true.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we put a release on the wire and the client sees it on a
portal (alongside news stories), they see that as a win,'' said
Debbie Capuano, a technology PR consultant in Mill Valley. ``It's
muddying the line between real news and hype. From a PR standpoint,
it's nice, but it takes away the credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Grabowicz, coordinator of the New Media Program at the
University of California at Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism,
thinks Web sites should do a better job of identifying press
releases. ``Sometimes, it's not clear, especially when the press
release is well written, whether it's a news story or not,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon may not be all bad. Many discerning readers can
tell the difference. And many portals, including Yahoo, do print a
disclaimer saying ``Company Press Release.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, giving readers access to a company's releases
``allows them to see the raw material that most reporters use in
part to help construct the story. It's good, because it's a check
on the press that didn't exist before,'' said Grabowicz.
</P>
<P>
   That check is likely to accelerate as news conferences and
conference calls increasingly find their way to the Web. ``People
can see how lousy we are as note takers,'' Grabowicz said. ``If
it's good journalism, it ought to be able to stand that test.''
</P>
<P>
   Giving people direct access to company announcements also
heightens the need for news providers to do more in-depth
reporting, if only to differentiate themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not packaging news with any interpretive analysis,
what are you doing?'' asked Jeff O'Brien, editor of the San
Francisco trade magazine Marketing Computers.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said that in the early days of the Web, it was important
for news sites to be first _ to have a scoop. Today, some readers
are less concerned with who's first and instead are just looking
for a place to get all the main news on one page.
</P>
<P>
   And that's where the portals come in.
</P>
<P>
   On Snap.com, a San Francisco portal that's a joint venture of
Cnet and NBC, business news comes from a variety of sources:
Bloomberg, Reuters, Business Week, MSNBC, Cnet's News.com, Business
Wire and PR Newswire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know right off the bat that we are not a news creator,''
said Sam Parker, vice president of core product development at
Snap.com. ``We feel it's our job as an aggregator to pull together
all the best sources of information on the Web and make it easy for
users to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   The widespread dissemination of press releases also helps
companies, especially small ones, whose news otherwise might not
make it through a publication's screening process.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the phenomenon is driven by newly insatiable demand for
stock market information.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission requires public companies
to put their news releases out to all news outlets simultaneously.
To fulfill that requirement, most companies use Business Wire,
based in San Francisco, or PR Newswire of New York. Both companies
distribute press releases to news organizations for a fee. The Web
provides even wider distribution and helps make sure that the
broadest range of people will have access to investment information
at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Day traders now watch for the headlines on press releases,
hoping they can anticipate action in a stock. Why wait for a
newspaper to digest the story and put its analysis out the next
day, when there's money to be made today?
</P>
<P>
   The wires even post analysts' recommendations. If a day trader
can buy a stock at the moment something is posted, and sell it
hours later when the stock has moved, he can make a tidy profit.
</P>
<P>
   PR Newswire and Business Wire say their biggest problem is
filtering out bogus releases. One scam artist used PR Newswire last
year to tout a stock with a bogus ``buy'' recommendation, said John
Williams, an executive vice president. ``We put a stop to that
immediately,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Business Wire, meanwhile, is suing the pranksters who put out an
April Fool's release announcing a new investment opportunity in a
faux company called WebNode. More than 2,000 people responded
before the hoax was uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   Lorry I. Lokey, president of Business Wire, founded the company
38 years ago by sending releases over a dedicated phone line,
clacking them out on teletype machines at 75 words per minute.
``Now, you blink your eye, and it's gone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But a press release is still ``a handout,'' he said. And no one,
even the average Web surfer, should confuse it with real news.
``Anyone half knowledgeable can see it's a publicity release
because of the writing,'' Lokey said. ``The writing's inferior.''

ROUNDING WISE, PENNY FOOLISH 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As New Yorkers struggle through the great penny
shortage of 1999, there are profound mysteries to contemplate:
</P>
<P>
   How many bonuses must banks and stores offer to get New Yorkers
to bring in the pennies stashed in their sock drawers?
</P>
<P>
   How many pairs of socks would those pennies buy?
</P>
<P>
   How can there be a shortage of something that nobody wants?
</P>
<P>
   Those mysteries are too complex to be addressed in this space.
But there is room to deal with a more mundane question: how can we
seize this historic opportunity to get rid of the penny?
</P>
<P>
   Prompt action is required, because the U &UR; . &LR; S &UR; . &LR;  Mint is working
around the clock to inflict more pennies on America. To resupply
banks in the East and Midwest that have run out, the Mint is
churning out more than a billion pennies per month, most of them
justly destined for oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of pennies don't circulate,'' said Philip N.
Diehl, director of the Mint. ``They make a one-way trip from us to
penny jars, sock drawers, piggy banks and the spaces between couch
cushions. Two-thirds of the pennies produced in the last 30 years
have dropped out of circulation.''
</P>
<P>
   That works out to more than 700 missing pennies for every
American, proof that people are smart enough not to spend their
valuable time counting worthless coins. This lesson still escapes
the federal government, even though a few penny abolitionists at
work in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The most vocal is James C. Benfield, the executive director of
the Coin Coalition. His group, which is supported by the
vending-machine industry, wants to eliminate the penny so that
there's room in cash registers and pockets for one-dollar coins. He
advocates rounding off to the nearest nickel on all cash
transactions (1 and 2 are rounded down; 3 and 4 are rounded up).
</P>
<P>
   ``Pennies are useless, but they make up 42 percent of the coins
you get in change,'' Benfield said. ``Forty thousand tons of zinc a
year are wasted to make new pennies. We can easily get rid of this
nuisance by rounding off. It's already being done on American
military bases overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to eliminate the penny, though, have been stymied in
Congress by politicians from Illinois, who object to taking
Lincoln's face out of circulation, and by the penny industrial
complex: the companies that mine zinc and supply the Mint with
round blanks to make the coins.
</P>
<P>
   These companies support a group called Americans for Common
Cents, which puts out material like ``Ten Reasons to Keep the
Penny.'' No. 9 is, ``The penny has been an integral part of the
American experience.'' No. 5 is even more weighty. Noting that
consumers would feel ``ripped off'' by having to pay $7.80 for a
$7.78 purchase, Americans for Commons Cents warns: ``Abolishing the
penny could erode consumer confidence in the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see why those arguments, accompanied by a few
campaign contributions, would stop politicians from doing anything.
But why hasn't the private sector responded? A few merchants have
taken steps _ Saul Zabar has priced everything in his new cafe on
Broadway to spare clerks from handling pennies _ but most are
passing up a chance to save themselves time and money.
</P>
<P>
   A typical drug store could save more than $2,000 a year by
eliminating pennies, according to a study done by Walgreens.
Managers wouldn't have to buy rolls of pennies; clerks wouldn't
have to unwrap the rolls and count up the coins at the end of the
shift. The average transaction would be 2.5 seconds shorter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rounding off is something we might consider if the penny
shortage persists,'' said Ed King, Walgreens &UR; ' &LR;  director of trade
and corporate relations. ``But we're not sure how customers would
react.''
</P>
<P>
   That uncertainty, along with the work involved in retraining
clerks and reprogramming change-dispensers, has stopped most
retailers from making the switch. What if clerks had to spend 15
seconds explaining the system to each customer? What if some
penny-pinchers refused to accept the rounding up of a 98-cent
purchase?
</P>
<P>
   But if enough retailers started doing it, most customers could
adjust quickly. And as a public relations measure, perhaps a store
could post a sign offering to provide the full change in pennies to
anyone who demanded it. That way the penny-pinchers would be
mollified, and everyone else would have lighter pockets _ plus, of
course, some extra space in the sock drawer.

4-YEAR-OLD BOY THANKS OFFERS THANKS TO POLICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JESSE HIESTAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Among the 60 children who returned to the North
Valley Jewish Community Center on Wednesday was 4-year-old Nathan
Powers, a boy on a special mission: He wanted to thank the police.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving at the center, Nathan pulled out a note he had
written and handed it to Los Angeles police Officer David Hunt, who
was guarding the community center along with armed private security
guards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you policemen for saving us from the gun because I want
you to be my friend,'' said Nathan's note. ``I was scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunt took the note and smiled. ``The letter means a lot to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy's father, John Powers, said it was important for his son
to return to the center and see his friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of this today is for him, his recovery, and to find a way
for him to express himself,'' said Powers, who like many parents
said he was not worried about taking Nathan to the community
center, especially given the heightened security.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan said he felt it was safe enough to return because the
suspected gunman, Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr., had turned himself in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel it's really great he's in jail and he can't get us,''
said Nathan, cradled in the arms of his mother, Gail Powers, of
suburban Northridge. ``I feel great, and it's really OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Trauma experts, however, said they worried about the emotional
toll.
</P>
<P>
   The task of coaxing that pain out of the kids fell to 20
psychologists, social workers and counselors from Jewish Family
Services of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles County Department of
Mental Health.
</P>
<P>
   The community center held classes and summer camp next door at
St. Andrew &AMP; St. Charles Episcopal Church, as crews patched bullet
holes, replaced windows and scrubbed blood from floors in the
center's buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Those who returned met with counselors throughout the day. The
center's staff of 45 teen-age advisers and adult teachers also
received counseling, leading some to break down in tears.
</P>
<P>
   Parents of the kids and neighbors from the immediate
neighborhood were invited to meet with counselors Wednesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan was inside the center during the attack and said he
vividly recalls the crackle of gunshots and seeing smoke pour from
the barrel of a gun _ images and sounds that crisis counselors
hoped to help him handle through chats, crafts, drawings and song.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the children are talking about the bad man who
came,'' said Sally Weber, a Jewish Family Services counselor.
``They want to know about the monster: Why he came? Are they safe
here? What if he comes back? What if he comes to my house?''
</P>
<P>
   ``So there was a palpable sense of relief when we heard he was
arrested,'' Weber said.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents said they had to hold their own impromptu
counseling sessions at home, especially in the hours just after the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Dreyfuss, 44, of Granada Hills had three children at
the community center during the shooting. While the older two kids,
10 and 9, were whisked to the safety of a nearby park, the
youngest, 5-year-old Daniel, saw his counselor after she'd been
shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to elicit from him what his feelings are,''
Dreyfuss said. ``We really haven't done a lot of explaining, just
that everything's OK and that his friends are going to be OK and
his counselor's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreyfuss said he felt compelled to talk to his older children
about the alleged racial motivation for the shooting _ a difficult
discussion that he had hoped to have with them later in their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Abby Dreyfuss, 10, was in the center at the time of the
shooting, preparing to leave on a field trip with other kids but
said she was not afraid to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good because I'm safe and I have a lot of my friends to
be with,'' Abby said.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha, a 15-year-old counselor who did not give her last
name, said she was near the entrance to the building when she saw
the gunman. Two of the seven children she was responsible for were
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a really sweet boy. He was very calm, very
cooperative,'' she said. ``I told him to breathe and he did.''

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR KNICKS, A NEW ERA OPENS, BUT AN OLD ISSUE
LINGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Knicks' news conference Wednesday was
heralded as the announcement of a new era. Scott Layden, the
respected 41-year-old general manager of the Utah Jazz, would be
the Knicks' new executive vice president and general manager. He
would fill the job vacated last April when Ernie Grunfeld was
dismissed by Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts in a
move that in some ways culminated, and in other ways stirred, an
intriguing internal conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday we were being told that that era of conflict was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new day,'' Checketts said. ``A new beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   But the first question directed at Checketts concerned a member
of the old regime, Ed Tapscott, the Knicks' vice president of
player personnel. Throughout the summer, Tapscott was seen as the
leading candidate for the general manager's job. Why was he passed
over? Wouldn't hiring Tapscott have sent a resonant message to
other franchises that have dragged their feet in hiring members of
minorities, particularly African-Americans?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about sending messages,'' Checketts said. ``This
is not about race. This is about doing what's best for the
organization.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still the questions came. Someone wondered about the implicit
message being sent. In a sports environment where education is
stressed but often lacking, what does it mean when someone achieves
education, climbs the corporate ladder, helps reshape the franchise
_ and then, at the moment of truth, gets passed over?
</P>
<P>
   At age 46, the erudite Tapscott had credentials that any
corporation, especially a sports franchise, might covet: a
bachelor's degree in political science from Tufts, a law degree
from American University. Tapscott served as head coach at American
for eight seasons and has spent eight seasons with the Knicks. He
worked with Grunfeld to recast the Knicks as a younger, more
athletic team that came three victories short of an National
Basketball Association championship. Obviously, this wasn't good
enough for Checketts, who said he does not see color when making
personnel decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Layden brings stellar credentials to the Knicks. He
represents the sort of pick-and-roll steadiness that made the Jazz
a perennial playoff team.
</P>
<P>
   Not a particularly riveting playoff team, not a particularly
exciting playoff team. But a viable commodity in one of the NBA's
smallest markets.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, the Knicks evolved into a fresh and lively team
last season, thanks largely to Latrell Sprewell and Marcus Camby _
players brought to the team by Grunfeld and Tapscott.
</P>
<P>
   What complicates the Tapscott issue is that before you even get
to race, you have to consider politics. Animosity between Grunfeld
and Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy boiled over into incessant back
biting last season that fractured the organization into two camps.
Tapscott was hired by Grunfeld, is a close friend of Grunfeld, and
he took his friend's dismissal hard.
</P>
<P>
   One team official said Wednesday that the lingering enmities
surfaced this summer, and the situation seemed unsalvageable.
Rather than go through another season of feuding, the official
said, the Knicks decided to reward Van Gundy _ who had the
confidence of the players after a winning season _ with a contract
extension, and then bring in a general manger with no connections.
At least not to Grunfeld.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, talking about the decision not to give Tapscott
the job, Checketts said, ``There were personal reasons,'' adding
cryptically that he wanted to protect Tapscott.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all that I'm going to say about Ed,'' Checketts
said. ``He's a valuable guy. I think that he's going to remain with
us. I believe he'll be the general manager of a team. It just won't
be now with the Knicks. There are reasons for making that decision
that I've said I want to protect him on.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Asked about possible personal reasons, Tapscott simply, and
vaguely, referred to his commuting situation _ his family still
lives in the Washington area _ and the demands of the job. Mostly,
though, he steered attention back to Layden.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about Scott Layden,'' he said, ``not Ed Tapscott.''
</P>
<P>
   Would Tapscott remain in the Knicks' organization, with the idea
of positioning himself for a general manager's job elsewhere?
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll talk,'' Tapscott said.
</P>
<P>
   The Garden could have hired Tapscott. Grunfeld could have
brought Tapscott and Van Gundy together and told them that what the
Knicks built last season was special, more important than the
internecine squabbling.
</P>
<P>
   The Garden president feels the Knicks got smarter on Wednesday.
I say the Knicks became more stabilized and efficient.
</P>
<P>
   If they have a run like they had last season, no one will care
who the general manager is.
</P>
<P>
   Checketts made a solid move, not a brilliant move. A move to
force peace, and avert the sort of tension that characterized last
season but gave the season its life, its vibrancy.
</P>
<P>
   In skipping over Tapscott, the Knicks missed an opportunity to
build on something fresh. Time will tell whether the sure thing is
better than the fresh thing. This much is certain: the move had
better work. The next item to fall could be the Garden president.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Scott Layden, the New York Knicks' new executive vice
president and general manager, has been called a good evaluator of
talent. Dave Checketts, the president of Madison Square Garden,
revealed Wednesday that Layden was even better than most people
realized.
</P>
<P>
   As the assistant coach of the Utah Jazz in the mid-1980s, Layden
was responsible for drafting the future Hall of Famers Karl Malone
and John Stockton out of Louisiana Tech and Gonzaga, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the room when he said, `We're taking Karl Malone.' I
was there when he said, `We're taking John Stockton,''' said
Checketts, who worked with Layden for the Jazz from 1983 to 1989.
``It was his knowledge and his scouting, so I give him the credit
for both Malone and Stockton.''
</P>
<P>
   Such keen basketball insight was one of the many reasons
Checketts gave for hiring Layden, who chose Malone with the 13th
pick of the 1985 draft and Stockton with the 16th pick a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Layden, 41, received a contract that is believed to be worth
more than $6 million over four years to run the Knicks' basketball
operation after serving 18 years with the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks also officially announced that Coach Jeff Van Gundy
had been signed to a contract extension. Van Gundy, who had two
years _ worth $5.5 million _ left on his contract, received an
extension through the 2002-3 season for approximately $4.5 million
annually.
</P>
<P>
   Though they have never worked together, Layden and Van Gundy
have a common friend in Gordon Chiesa, the current assistant coach
of the Jazz. Chiesa and Van Gundy were assistants under Rick Pitino
when Providence reached the National Collegiate Athletic
Association Final Four in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have as much respect for Gordon as for anybody in
basketball,'' Van Gundy said. ``And in turn, he has as much respect
for Scott as I've ever heard Gordon speak about somebody. Not only
his expertise. I think that's unquestioned. But just how he goes
about his job. That's how I got to know Scott, through Gordon.''
</P>
<P>
   Layden, who worked with Chiesa for 10 years in Utah, said he
called Checketts in 1991 to congratulate him on being named the
president of the Knicks and ended up plugging Van Gundy, who at the
time was a Knicks assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unsolicited, I said to Dave: `You've got a guy in your
organization who you probably don't know because you took the job a
few hours ago, but he is an excellent basketball man. And that's
Jeff Van Gundy,''' Layden said. ``I said, `You ought to really take
the time and check him out because he's really good.' I think back
to that time now, and it's kind of funny how it comes in a full
circle.'''
</P>
<P>
   Layden said he would have the final say on all personnel moves,
but he said that Van Gundy would have extensive input in decisions,
and Van Gundy said he accepts that. The power struggle between Van
Gundy and Ernie Grunfeld, the Knicks' former general manager,
played a role in Checketts' decision to bypass Ed Tapscott, who
served as the interim general manager this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Tapscott, who said he was unsure whether he would remain as the
Knicks' vice president for player personnel, was a close associate
of Grunfeld's, and Checketts apparently worried about Tapscott's
ability to work with Van Gundy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this situation, with what had gone on in the past, with the
chemistry that had taken place between the front office and the
head coach and for a number of other factors _ which out of respect
for Ed I'll leave out _ I needed to go outside,'' Checketts said.
</P>
<P>
   Layden steered clear of addressing the potentially controversial
issues surrounding his new team. He was gracefully evasive when
asked about signing Latrell Sprewell to a long-term contract
extension or trading him, the role of Patrick Ewing in the Knicks'
offense or the acquisition of a point guard.
</P>
<P>
   Layden was born in Brooklyn and played high school basketball in
upstate New York. He said his father, Frank, the president of the
Jazz, was thrilled about his new job despite his departure from
Utah. Frank Layden grew up in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn and
began his coaching career on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was scouting for the Jazz as the second assistant, and
my dad was the head coach, I would leave the team sometimes,''
Layden said. ``But my dad always made sure that I was back for the
Knicks game. It was a demand. His thing was that it's special to
play in New York. He said, `It's special to be in Madison Square
Garden and I want you there.'''

RYDER CUP CAPTAIN CRITICAL OF 2 UNNAMED PLAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ Even before the first tee shot, the atmosphere
surrounding the 81st PGA Championship has become confrontational,
compelling and charged with controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's round of pre-tournament news conferences ended with
a lightning bolt, when Ben Crenshaw, the U.S. Ryder Cup captain,
sharply criticized the attitudes of two players, whom he not
identify, regarding the cup tournament next month.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods and David Duval are among those who would like to
see players compensated for playing in the Ryder Cup, with the
intention of donating their pay to charity.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Crenshaw and 16 other players attended a meeting in
the clubhouse of Medinah Country Club with Jim Awtrey, the chief
executive officer of the PGA of America, and Tim Finchem,
commissioner of the PGA Tour, to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw left that meeting feeling ``a little empty.'' And on
Wednesday, after trying to hold back, he finally allowed his
innermost feelings to surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say one thing,'' Crenshaw said, the passion etched
in his face. ``I'm personally disappointed in a couple people in
that meeting. Whether some players like it or not, there are some
people who came before them that mean a hell of a lot to this game.
And it burns the hell out of me to listen to some of their
viewpoints.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval and Woods were the most likely targets of Crenshaw's ire,
although Mark O'Meara has also supported Ryder Cup compensation in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw's unexpected remarks added some intriguing questions as
the final major of the century gets under way Thursday at Medinah
(7,401 yards), the second-longest course in major championship
history.
</P>
<P>
   Can Duval, who regained the world's No. 1 ranking from Woods on
Monday, block out this latest off-the-course controversy and win
his first major? Can Woods, who has not won a major since the
Masters in 1997, add another major in what has already been a
successful year? Which players will earn their way onto the Ryder
Cup team this weekend, and which will be left off?
</P>
<P>
   Those questions will soon be answered, but for players looking
to win their first major, the PGA Championship has been a friendly
setting. Ten of the last 11 PGAs have been won by first-time major
winners, the lone exception being Nick Price, who won his second
PGA title in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The last four winners have won their only major at the PGA _
Steve Elkington (1995), Mark Brooks (1996), Davis Love III (1997)
and Vijay Singh (1998). Duval heads a list of prominent players
looking to win their first major at Medinah; the list includes
Colin Montgomerie, Lee Westwood and Phil Mickelson. For one of
those players, this weekend could be the biggest of his career.
</P>
<P>
   And Duval, who likes the long layout at Medinah, is eager to add
a major to his resume after tying for sixth at the Masters, tying
for seventh at the U.S. Open and tying for 56th at the British Open
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, I don't think you could rate my performance much
above mediocre,'' said Duval, when asked about his play at this
year's majors. ``I think my play at Augusta was too sporadic. At
Pinehurst, I hit a couple of bad shots that cost me dearly. At
Carnoustie, I just didn't play good. So in all, it's probably not
quite what I would have hoped for. But I have another opportunity
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval's journey will be particularly interesting to track this
week because he has recently been a source of contention. Some
people didn't like his Aug. 2 made-for-television showdown against
Tiger Woods. At the British Open last month, he was chastised by
some European newspapers for objecting to the unusually difficult
course set-up at Carnoustie. This week, he has been repeatedly
asked about the Ryder Cup pay issue.
</P>
<P>
   Duval rarely opts not to answer questions, even when those
answers may not be well received. But as the No. 1-ranked player in
the world, his words carry additional clout.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to No. 1, all of a sudden I had to know a lot more
than I knew the day before,'' he said. ``I became an authority on
stuff I'm not an authority on. As a player, you don't change
because you went to No. 1. You don't know any more. I try to let
people know that, but they don't want to listen.''

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: THE TRAFFIC CONGESTION STRANGLING NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By ERNEST TOLLERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   People on California's central coast have decided that gridlock
and congestion just do not mesh well with their life style.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Santa Cruz County Regional Transportation
Commission approved a plan to put five miles of high-occupancy/toll
(HOT) lanes on Highway 1. While those in carpools, buses and vans
would ride in the designated lanes free of charge, solo motorists
would pay a variable toll that would be higher during rush hours
and lower in the off-peak. Like similar lanes in San Diego and
Houston, the HOT lanes would free space in general-purpose lanes.
Toll revenue would help finance the lanes.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York metropolitan area, the vast majority of folks
seem content to spend large chunks of their waking hours inhaling
fumes in bumper-to-bumper traffic and using their vehicles as some
kind of mobile study outfitted with books on tape, cell phones and
CDs. Local radio and television stations nowadays cover rush hour
in the region as if gridlock were a natural phenomenon beyond human
control, right up there with Nor'easters. Some people even see
clogged streets as an indicator of prosperity _ great for the
economy and the area's future.
</P>
<P>
   This mindset does not augur well for that future. Travel times
in the region are 40 percent longer than they would be if traffic
flowed freely, according to the Texas Transportation Institute,
which reviewed 1996 data from 70 metropolitan regions. Fuel wasted
annually in traffic jams amounts to 51 gallons per capita and 63
gallons per driver. Congestion's cost _ adding the price of delay
and wasted gas _ makes the New York region second in the nation in
dollars squandered, wasting $9.8 billion in 1996, just behind Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   This is not, of course, a new problem. A mid-1980s congestion
study clocked the average commute to Manhattan from eight
communities, all of them a mere 15 miles away. Under free-flow
conditions, reaching Manhattan took anywhere from 20 minutes
(Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn) or 21 minutes (Yonkers) to no more than
34 minutes (Little Neck, Queens). Rush-hour trips from these points
took anywhere from a maximum of 47 minutes (Yonkers) to 49 minutes
(Sheepshead Bay) or 1 hour 10 minutes (Little Neck). Things have
only gotten worse since then.
</P>
<P>
   More and better rapid transit _ a new trans-Hudson commuter tube
from the west, a new subway on Manhattan's East Side and improved
rail service from the other directions _ would surely help. Cutting
aid for new roads and sewers and other incentives that promote
sprawl and auto use is another good idea. But these ideas, which
take years to institute, have yet to make the jump from press
release to firm policy.
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders ought to declare rush-hour road space a
scarce, underpriced commodity, similar to the services utilities
offer. Power and telecommunications companies use peak and off-peak
prices to vary the cost of their products and modulate demand.
Similarly, there should be variable tolls on some stretches of road
and major bridges and tunnels, higher at rush hour and lower when
fewer cars are on the roads. At the very least, the region should
experiment with variable tolls on all or most of the bridges and
tunnels leading to Manhattan _ including the toll-free bridges on
the East River, which charged a fee until Mayor William Gaynor
removed the tolls early in the century.
</P>
<P>
   Regrettably, neither the governors of New York and New Jersey
nor the mayor of New York City seem eager to let market forces rule
rush hour, even though all three are Republicans and, presumably,
believers in the market's wisdom. The only congestion-pricing
experiment in the region is a modest one for trucks on the Tappan
Zee Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The New York region has spent the last decade ducking
opportunities to use variable pricing, despite federal mandates to
produce cleaner air and the area's thirst for more jobs. Those
needs, plus the quality-of-life gains that smoother traffic would
bring, should persuade local politicians to give market forces a
try.

FAA ORDERS INSULATION ON CERTAIN MD JETS REPLACED BECAUSE OF FIRE
DANGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In response to the deadly crash last year of a
Swissair MD-11 that plunged into the ocean after an in-flight
electrical fire, the Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday
ordered the replacement of insulation material in 699 McDonnell
Douglas planes in the U.S. fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The fiberglass insulation is covered with metallized Mylar,
which not only can ignite much more easily than other aircraft
insulation, but can help spread a fire, the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
   It is used in the DC-10, MD-11, MD-80, MD-88 and MD-90, and all
those models are affected by the FAA directive.
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell Douglas notified operators of those models in August
1996 to consider replacing the insulation because it might be
flammable, according to a spokesman for The Boeing Co., which
acquired McDonnell Douglas in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The MD-11, MD-80 and MD-90 are still in production in Long
Beach, Calif., but the suspect insulation has not been used in new
planes since 1996, the Boeing spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing does not use metallized Mylar insulation in its planes.
</P>
<P>
   The insulation was used extensively in the Swissair MD-11 that
crashed last September near Halifax, Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   The jet plunged into coastal waters 16 minutes after the crew
reported smoke in the cockpit. All 229 passengers and crew were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Safety Board of Canada, which is
investigating the Swissair crash, said Wednesday metallized Mylar
insulation blankets were used extensively in the forward ceiling
area aft of the cockpit on the Swissair MD-11. That is the area
where the electrical fire is believed to have started.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of burned insulation blankets recovered from the wreckage
indicated ``the material was a significant source of the
combustible materials that propagated the fire,'' the safety board
said.
</P>
<P>
   Insulation blankets are used throughout modern airliners,
including the electronics bay. They protect a plane's interior from
wind and engine noise, from moisture and from temperature
variations.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing the blankets will not be an easy task, the FAA
acknowledged. It will also be expensive. The FAA estimated the work
would cost between $380,000 and $880,000 per plane.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. operators include American, Delta, Continental, Alaska,
TWA, Federal Express, Reno Air, US Airways and Aeromexico, the FAA
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major, major undertaking,'' said John Hotard, a
spokesman for AMR Corp.'s American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   He said the true cost has not been determined. Although airlines
are likely to bear much of the expense, Boeing will have to foot
some of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Who pays will be determined on a ``customer-by-customer basis,''
and depends on the airplane warranty terms, a Boeing spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the FAA directive, operators of the McDonnell Douglas
planes have four years to replace the insulation, but the federal
agency urged the work be done during the earliest practical
maintenance check.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Swissair crash, the FAA has been conducting tests on
different airplane insulation material.
</P>
<P>
   Working with industry experts, the FAA developed new flame
retardency standards for aircraft insulation. The agency said it
will propose the tougher standards for new airplane insulation
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even a low-level ignition source, like an electrical arc, could
cause the metallized Mylar insulation to catch fire, the FAA found.
</P>
<P>
   Other types of insulation commonly used in commercial passenger
jets also failed the new burn test, but did not pose the same
degree of safety hazard as metalized Mylar, the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's latest insulation replacement order falls far short
of a much more sweeping plan it proposed last year soon after the
Swissair crash.
</P>
<P>
   That proposal called for the replacement of insulation in nearly
every U.S. commercial airplane, and would have cost airlines
billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Transport Association, a trade group that represents
U.S. airlines, has argued that insulation is not an immediate
safety problem, and that replacing insulation is such a huge job
that it could have unsafe consequences since insulation is often
threaded around wires and other potential ignition sources.
</P>
<P>
   FAA officials Wednesday denied the agency caved in to pressure
from the airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Gane Garvey, FAA administrator, said in a statement, ``We've
weighed the benefit of replacing insulation, reviewed the service
history of these aircraft and have made the right decision.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 1,230 airplanes in the worldwide fleet that are
affected by the order. The FAA does not have the power to order
foreign airlines to make the changes, but most foreign safety
agencies usually follow the FAA's lead on safety matters.

POPE APPEALS TO BUSH TO SPARE KILLER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN MORITZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Pope John Paul II, through an emissary in
Washington, has appealed to Gov. George W. Bush to grant clemency
to killer Larry Keith Robison, who is scheduled to be executed
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's office released a letter Wednesday from Archbishop
Gabriel Montalvo, the Vatican's U.S. apostolic nuncio, who said the
pontiff believes that Robison should receive special consideration
because he has been classified as paranoid schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Holy Father, while praying and expressing deep sympathy
for the victim, for his family and friends, as well as for the
other victims Mr. Robison has admitted killing, prays nevertheless
that the life of Mr. Robison may be saved through your undoubted
awareness of the humanitarian dimension'' of such a case, the
letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Robison, 42, was sentenced to die for fatally shooting Bruce
Gardner, 33, on Aug. 10, 1982. Gardner was among five people
Robison confessed to killing at two cottages near Lake Worth. The
other victims were Robison's housemate Rickey Lee Bryant, 31;
Georgia Ann Reed, 34; Reed's mother, Earline Barker, 55; and Reed's
son, Scott, 11.
</P>
<P>
   Robison was not tried in the other cases, but he could be if his
death sentence for Gardner's death is commuted.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and relatives of the victims say they don't believe
Robison's contention that mental illness caused the killing spree.
They point out that he purchased a handgun a week before the
attacks and had the presence of mind to steal Gardner's car and
credit cards before fleeing the state.
</P>
<P>
   Lois Robison, the condemned man's mother, has rallied activists
who oppose the death penalty and those in the mental health
community.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Edwards, a spokeswoman for Bush, said the governor's
office has received about 160 letters asking that Robison's life be
spared.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, the governor may commute a death sentence or
grant clemency only if a recommendation comes from the Texas Board
of Pardons and Paroles. The parole board is expected to make a
recommendation in Robison's case by the end of the week.

SHOOTINGS TRIGGER FEAR AT VALLEY DAY-CARE CENTERS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ San Fernando Valley child-care centers considered
adding security, parents kept their children home from summer camp
and temples hired extra guards as the shooting rampage at the
Jewish Community Center in Granada Hills cast a shadow of fear
across the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's this feeling of helplessness you have when something like
this happens,'' said Lila Snow, director of Temple Ahavat Shalom's
child-care program, located about a mile from Tuesday's shooting.
About 50 of its 70 students stayed home Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was really close,'' Snow said.
</P>
<P>
   School administrators hoped the absences would end with the
gunman's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had people call and say, I'm coming to get my child _ oh
wait, they caught him, my child can stay,'' said Sharon Jaffe,
office manager for the Adat Ari El Early Childhood Center in North
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Still, fear clutched the hearts of many in the San Fernando
Valley, where extra security measures were being looked into by
officials at temples, child-care centers and schools.
</P>
<P>
   Adat Ari El posted a guard outside its school and buzzed parents
through the door instead of leaving it open. The center also had to
cancel a student trip to a local park, worried that the students'
T-shirts with the school's name could make them targets if the
gunman remained in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want a bunch of Jewish kids with T-shirts out in a
park somewhere,'' Jaffe said.
</P>
<P>
   She too hoped that with the gunman's capture, parents would feel
more at ease about bringing their children to school. But the
security guard would stay for the next three weeks, just in case.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Tuesday's attack, a parent group that is meeting
Thursday from Learn and Play Child Development Centers in nearby
Glendale will discuss the issue of whether to make the two
facilities safer, director Judy Crawford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will basically have to set up better precautions for
ourselves because we have created a society that is so violent,''
said Crawford, who oversees the centers that together serve nearly
130 children a day year-round.
</P>
<P>
   One solution she was considering for the main center at Glenoaks
Boulevard and Central Avenue was allying with a neighboring
Catholic school and one or two nearby businesses to hire jointly a
security guard to patrol the area, she said.
</P>
<P>
   It might not prevent attacks like Tuesday's, Crawford said, but
``it does allow for immediate help'' if something happens.
</P>
<P>
   Security keypads requiring a code to unlock every door might be
the best solution, she said, but they require a panic bar on the
inside for immediate exit in case of emergency and cost about
$1,000 per door.
</P>
<P>
   At the Temple Ner Maarav Nursery School in Encino, they didn't
wait to act. They hired two security guards Wednesday and the
temple caretaker acted as a doorman at the front entrance until the
guards arrived, staffer Pamela Pilling said.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term security provisions will be up to the temple board of
directors, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pilling said attendance at the school's summer camp ``might have
been a little lower'' than on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Valley day-care programs reported few students
staying home Wednesday, although many fielded calls from anxious
parents asking about security measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just shaken up and called to ask if everything was
OK, which it was,'' said Donna Halsey, director of All About Kids
in Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Pam N at Temple Ner Maarav Nursery School in Encino took the
opposite approach, calling parents Tuesday night to assure them
their children would be safe.
</P>
<P>
   Only three or four of the school's 27 children were absent, N
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although most students seemed unaware of Tuesday's shooting, one
boy brought a tzedakah box _ a collection of personal savings for
charitable purposes _ as a donation to the shooting victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You know, something really horrible happened at this
other school, and I want you to send this to them,' '' N said. The
box held about $6 in change, she said.
</P>
<P>
   At All About Kids, Halsey said she too would look into extra
protective steps, even though nary a parent brought it up
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're going to have to at least think about it,'' she
said. ``When you're a preschool, you realize you have to be
prepared for any eventuality in this day and age.''

PIERCE AVENGES LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN BEACH _ There was no deja vu for Mary Pierce. If the
Frenchwoman wanted to invent a phrase, it could be (begin ital)deja
cool(end ital).
</P>
<P>
   Pierce avenged a first-round loss to Ai Sugiyama in last week's
TIG Classic with a 6-3, 7-5 second-round victory Wednesday over the
Japanese player in the Acura Classic at Manhattan Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week, I just made a lot of unforced errors,'' Pierce
said. ``(Sugiyama) played a great match. She's very solid, great at
hitting balls back, makes great shots off the run. To beat her, you
have to be on your game and not making unforced errors.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 3 Pierce looked on her game Wednesday, especially late in
the match. After Sugiyama broke her serve in the second set to take
a 5-4 lead, she bore down, winning 12 of the final 17 points.
Pierce may have been playing poorly last week because she hadn't
been on the court since Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just rusty, and she played great,'' Pierce said. ``And
that happens sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Wedding bells: No. 4 Aranxta Sanchez-Vicario had an easy victory
over Romanian Ruxandra Dragomir 6-3, 6-1. After missing three
months earlier this year with a sprained ligament in her left
wrist, Sanchez-Vicario looked fresh. She admitted she played so
well, Dragomir would have had a tough time to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just tried to play deep and come in,'' Sanchez-Vicario
said. ``It's hard when I play as deep. I was trying to move her
around, and I served well, so I was happy how I played.''
</P>
<P>
   As Sanchez-Vicario had an easy victory, the conversation moved
to her personal life. The 27-year-old is engaged to a Spanish
journalist and has set a wedding date for next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez-Vicario perked up when asked about her wedding, an
opposite reaction to Pierce, who was tight-lipped about her
relationship with Cleveland Indians second baseman Roberto Alomar.
Pierce did say the two are not engaged.
</P>
<P>
   Need for speed: No. 6 Serena Williams beat Patty Schnyder of
Switzerland convincingly 6-3, 6-1 in 47 minutes. But Williams said
she needed to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't play well,'' Williams said. ``I served well,
but I was just hitting 100 or 103 (mph). I can really get it up
there to about 119, 120.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams will face Sanchez-Vicario in the quarterfinals and said
her plan against the Spaniard is to ``be really consistent and
attack her balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Halard-Decugis advances: Julie Halard-Decugis of France edged
Michigan's Amy Frazier 7-6 (7-5), 7-5. When Frazier missed her
first serve, she had problems, winning just 26 percent of her
second serves. Halard-Decugis will meet Pierce in the
quarterfinals.

 &HT;    Falcons, Jamal Anderson reach agreement
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ The late afternoon mood in the parking lot
outside the Falcons' living quarters here summed it up Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As running back Jamal Anderson got out of the black stretch
limousine, he made a beeline for starting offensive linemen Bob
Whitfield, Ephraim Salaam and Calvin Collins.
</P>
<P>
   It was Collins who screamed, ``Big Money!'' as he and his fellow
blockers piled out of the golf cart that carried them from dinner
after day 14 of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   The nickname perfectly fit Anderson, who agreed about 20 minutes
earlier to a five-year, $32 million contract. The value of the
deal, and the $7.5 million signing bonus are franchise records.
He'll become one of the NFL's three highest-paid backs.
</P>
<P>
   The previous highs came last year when quarterback Chris
Chandler signed a five-year, $27 million deal with a $6 million
signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, 26, wasted no time getting to schmoozing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me; I'm happy. We'll have the new dance so everybody
will be smiling,'' he said. ``It'll be the, `Y2K Dirty Bird.' I
won't have any problem. I'm like Baryshnikov, a natural.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations were anything but that.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was done after Anderson, agent Jim Sims, and Falcons
general manager Harold Richardson wrapped up four-plus hours of
negotiations at the Greenville Hilton some 15 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dan Reeves participated in the first 70 minutes of talks
and then left for practice, staying in touch by cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves greeted Anderson and Sims in the players' parking lot,
where Richardson had led them after negotiations finished.
</P>
<P>
   The coach shook hands with Anderson, smiling broadly.
</P>
<P>
   Getting back a runner who went for a franchise-record 1,846
yards and 14 touchdowns last season on an NFL-record 410 carries
was a very good thing.
</P>
<P>
   The process of arriving at that point, however, was miserable.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves put on a smile for a 6:50 p.m., press conference, a stark
contrast to his grouchy mood after practice, when somebody asked
about something other than Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad somebody's asking a football question,'' he snapped.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Reeves remarked he didn't see what Sims' idea
of a face-to-face meeting would accomplish that eight months of
phone conversations could not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get a football team ready to play a game
Friday (a preseason contest against Detroit). I don't agree with
what Jamal did, and he knows that. But that's also part of this
business. Jamal did what he thought best.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves' mood changed a lot after the deal was done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better when you sit down face-to-face,'' he said. ``You
get more done.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said Anderson's nearly $75,000 in fines, ``will be
settled among us.'' Most likely, Reeves will not count the two
Sundays that Anderson missed because those were off days. That
means Anderson still will face about $65,000 in fines.
</P>
<P>
   At various points in negotiations, Sims sought a $10 million
signing bonus, then an $8 million signing bonus, threatened to have
Anderson sit out the season, and even said he would ask the Falcons
to trade his client if a deal couldn't be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' last offer prior to Wednesday was for a five-year
deal worth $28 million to $30 million with a $7 million signing
bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson wanted to have the contract less, ``backloaded,'' or to
have more money moved from the last couple years of the deal to the
first three.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who would have earned $2.6 million this year under his
old contract, will get a first-year salary of about $2.2 million.
An undisclosed part of his $7.5 million signing bonus will be
deferred.
</P>
<P>
   This deal leaves the team about $100,000 under the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``We moved money into the first two years, and adjusted the
third year some,'' said Sims, who flew back to Oakland, Calif.,
last night. ``Most of it came from the fifth year (where the
Falcons last offered a $9 million salary).''
</P>
<P>
   After hugging Anderson, Whitfield offered him a seat in the golf
cart, and whisked him off to meet other teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy to see the guys,'' Anderson said. ``I had in my
mind all along the date Aug. 12 because that's one month before
(the Sept. 12 season opener against) Minnesota. Everybody will tell
you you don't need to be in training camp six weeks anyway.

1 KILLED, 62 HURT AS TORNADO STRIKES SALT LAKE CITY  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Unusual atmospheric conditions just west of the
Rocky Mountains produced a tornado Wednesday that ripped through
Salt Lake City, killing at least one person, injuring at least 62
others and damaging numerous buildings in the downtown area.
</P>
<P>
   While meteorologists described the twister as a rare event for
Utah and as relatively benign, compared with tornadoes that
typically tear through the Midwest, it was nonetheless the first in
Utah to cause a death.
</P>
<P>
   `'In all my years in Salt Lake City, I've never seen anything
like it,'' said Mayor Deedee Corridini.
</P>
<P>
   The tornado touched down southwest of the city just before 1
p.m. Mountain time and took direct aim at the city's central
district, moving northeast toward the state Capitol. While the
Capitol was not damaged, other buildings were, including the Delta
Center, which is home to the Utah Jazz of the National Basketball
Association, and the Wyndham Hotel, where windows were blown out
and guests were evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   The tornado also blew off roofs throughout the city, uprooted
trees, caused numerous gas leaks and power outages, disrupted phone
service and left debris everywhere in its wake. By Wednesday
evening, calm had set in, but the downtown area was still a
patchwork of flashing lights from emergency vehicles, wailing
sirens and blinking traffic lights.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities closed off many downtown streets to keep people
from interfering with cleanup efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Collins, a deputy with the Salt Lake County sherrif's
department, said many of the injured were within a
five-square-block area that included many of the city's largest
hotels. A total of eight were seriously injured, and three were
critically injured. Many of the downtown hotels were filled with
visitors attending a convention of outdoor sports retailers.
</P>
<P>
   When the tornado hit, hundreds of the conventioneers were caught
in two large outdoor tents, where vendors were exhibiting their
goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was lunch hour. It's just a miracle more people weren't
killed and injured,'' said Sgt. Kenneth Hansen, a spokesman for the
Salt Lake City Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen said the the trade show, the Outdoor Retailers'
Convention, which was expected to attract 25,000, was scheduled to
open on Thursday. Had the tornado struck Thursday, the damaged tent
in the parking lot behind the Salt Palace Convention Center would
have been crowded with conventioneers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would have been a disaster,'' Hansen said. Officers with
specially trained dogs were sent to the site of the collapsed tent
to see if workers setting up convention booths were trapped in the
debris. The body was found near the convention tent.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. William Brass, a spokesman for the Salt Lake County Fire
Department, said, ``This caught us by surprise. We get dust devils
and it gets a little windy, that's usually all. But this was no
dust devil.''
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City last had a tornado in 1968, Brass said.
</P>
<P>
   Tornadoes are rare in Utah, which had 32 in 25 years, said Tim
Shy, a researcher at the University of Illinois at
Champaign-Urbana. Over the same 25 years, Oklahoma had 1,326.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Larry Burch, lead forecaster with the Salt Lake City office of
the National Weather Service, said the tornado was detected about
12:45 p.m. Mountain time, but the weather service's radar, about 40
miles from downtown, indicated only a severe thunderstorm.
</P>
<P>
   At 12:48 p.m. the weather service issued a warning of
``damaging'' winds in excess of 60 mph and large hail of up to
three-quarters of an inch in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It showed no tornadic signature,'' meaning rapid changes in
wind velocity, Burch said.
</P>
<P>
   The weather service estimated that the tornado left a ``damage
track'' as wide as a half-mile and as long as two miles. It touched
ground for at least five minutes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Sears, general manager of the Peery Hotel downtown, said
the tornado ``was humongous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This circular cloud was right on the ground, and I could just
see big chunks of metal that were folding like cardboard,'' Sears
said. ``I walked up one block to some other hotels to see if they
were OK, and there were bricks missing out of the sides of
buildings. But then there were cars still in the parking lots right
next to them, with some of the bricks in the front seats. There was
broken glass everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   John Dwan, a spokesman for the University of Utah hospital, said
he saw the tornado when he was driving not far from downtown. ``I
looked out over the valley, and I thought those are some of the
biggest thunderstorms I've ever seen around here,'' Dwan said. ``I
saw the clouds making these swirling motions, and explosions, and I
thought, `My God, that looks like a tornado, but it can't be
because we don't have tornadoes here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hansen reported some looting of automobiles shortly after the
tornado.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got officers going out to The Avenues,'' a residential
district north of downtown, he said, ``because we've got reports of
at least six rooftops ripped off houses.''

SHOOTINGS TAKE TOLL ON PEACE, SECURITY OF VALLEY JEWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Daily News Staff Writers Troy Anderson, David R. Baker and Jesse
Hiestand   contributed to this story) 
BY SHERRY JOE CROSBY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For some Jews in the San Fernando Valley the
shooting rampage at the Jewish Community Center in Granada Hills
irrevocably altered the sense of peace and security that they have
long felt here.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Fernando Valley Jews have felt relatively safe. It hasn't
changed because this was an outsider, but it shatters the
invulnerability we've felt,'' said Rabbi Stewart Vogel of Temple
Aliyah in the West Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Although the San Fernando Valley Jewish community long has been
concerned about safety, the shooting has forced many to think about
their security and well-being in new and unsettling ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a special event, you can plan for special
security measures. But thinking about special security measures
every day of your life is a new realization,'' Vogel said.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Dreyfuss, whose three children were at the Granada
Hills center during the shooting Tuesday, said the incident forced
him to discuss racism _ an ugly topic that he had hoped to delay
for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to take them and explain that there are people out
there who have issues with Jews,'' said the 44-year-old Granada
Hills resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a parent of Jewish children in 1999, at some point you have
to expose them to the fact that there are people out there that
will hate them for who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Nina Lieberman Giladi, whose 5-year-old son, Ben, was in the
center during the ordeal, said she hopes the Valley Jewish
community can somehow retain its sense of openness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we don't, as a community, all run back into our
homes,'' said Lieberman, associate vice president for the Jewish
Community Centers of Greater Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our children and all of us, we want to remain open as a
community _ to reach out to each other and give each other
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Jews across the Valley vowed to heal the psychic wounds and move
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to show that an act of terrorism is not going to end
Jewish life and Jewish Community Center life in the North Valley,''
said Jeffrey Rouss, executive vice president of the Jewish
Community Center of Greater Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody intimidates the Jewish community here or elsewhere. We
are going to become stronger. We are going to break down
barriers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Marvin Sugarman of the Shaarey Zedek Congregation fears
the approaching millennium could usher in an unprecedented wave of
attacks against Jews and other minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The close of the millennium is having an effect on a lot of
people's minds and it's bringing out pent-up resentments,'' said
Sugarman who presides over an Orthodox synagogue in North
Hollywood. ``I don't see a lessening of the attacks, if anything,
there will be more attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Roy, director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern
Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., agrees.
</P>
<P>
   Some extremists believe the year 2000 is going to bring
``rioting, looting and ultimately a race war,'' said Roy who
estimates there are 50,000 to 60,000 followers across the country
of various hate groups. The agency is currently tracking 537 active
hate groups and 435 anti-government or patriot groups.
</P>
<P>
   While Jewish individuals and organizations suffered the bulk of
religious hate crimes in Los Angeles County, those incidents
declined 14 percent from 100 in 1997 to 86 in 1998, according to
the county Human Relations Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, hate crimes dropped 6.2 percent in the county from 1997
to 1998, according to the county agency.
</P>
<P>
   In the Valley, which had the most hate crimes of any area of Los
Angeles during the first half of this year, officials are planning
to form a Valley hate crimes task force this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the present time, it appears the Valley is leading in hate
crimes,'' said Los Angeles Police Department Detective Tom King,
referring to statistics for the first six months of 1999, which
show 68 hate crimes in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the crimes were against the Valley's large Jewish
population, estimated at 250,000, King said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you change from one ethnicity to another you have
friction until that ethnicity assimulates into the culture,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor fueling hate crimes is the increase in the number
of hate-related Internet sights. Since April, the number of
hate-related Web sites has increased from 1,200 to 2,000, King
said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe R. Hicks, executive director of the Los Angeles City Human
Relations Commission, said the only way to curb hate crimes is
through stiff prosecution and education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to counter with a prosecutorial message and an
educational message that will allow the healthiest kind of
environment, which in turn will make it harder for people like
(suspected gunman Buford O'Neal) Furrow to do the kinds of things
that they do,'' Hicks said.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers belie a more sinister trend _ perpertrators of hate
crimes are becoming more violent, observers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the number of haters is declining, they're desperate,
and desperate for attention,'' said Sue Stengel, western states
counsel for the Anti-Defamation League.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hate crimes are becoming much more violent. These people are
craving much more attention than they had in the past.''

   HOUSTON _ A carjacker was killed Wednesday afternoon when he
crashed a stolen pickup, carrying three young children and their
teen-ager aunt, into a railing on the Ship Channel Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The man died instantly, but his four captives suffered only
minor injuries in the crash that ended the 35-minute, high-speed
chase, shown live on Houston television stations.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds before the crash, the man told his teen-age captive:
``All I wanted to do is get a ride home.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said the force of impact threw him out the passenger-side
window. He bounced off the guardrail and was run over by a
following six-wheel truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't beat the laws of physics,'' said Harris County
Deputy Gary Worley, who was pursuing the pickup. ``He just went
right out the window.''
</P>
<P>
   The teen and three children survived the impact because they
were apparently crouched down in the back of the crew-cab truck.
</P>
<P>
   Roxana Lopez, 15, and her nephews Christopher Aguilar, 5, Jesus
Aguilar, 2, and Brian Aguilar, 1, were shaken up, but suffered only
minor injuries, sheriff's deputies said. They were taken to Hermann
Hospital in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The carjacker had not been identified late Wednesday. An
identification card found in his clothing belonged to a 31-year-old
man, but investigators still were trying to confirm it was him.
</P>
<P>
   The carjacker stole the truck about 4:30 p.m. at an HEB grocery
store in east Harris County, while the children's mother, Claudia
Aguilar, 21, and her mother-in-law were filling bottles at the
water re-filling station.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned and I saw him get in the truck, and he just took off
before I could do anything,'' Aguilar said. ``I ran after the
truck, but I couldn't catch him.''
</P>
<P>
   Aguilar ran into a hair salon adjacent to the grocery and called
911.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy A.A. Woodward was nearby, heard the report and soon
spotted the car on the Freeway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in the fast lane and slowed down when he saw me,''
Woodward said. ``I looked over, and he just punched it.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodward began pursuit and called for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see the small children's heads through the back of the
smoke-tinted glass,'' Woodward said. ``It was very disheartening.
He was driving so recklessly. It was just a bad feeling in the pit
of your stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   The carjacker narrowly missed several vehicles as he wound his
way around east Harris County.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 10 minutes of the chase, Deputy Worley was right
behind the truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scared the hell out of me,'' Worley said. ``I was really,
really scared, thinking what am I doing here.''
</P>
<P>
   Worley said the truck got on the Ship Channel Bridge and was in
the second northbound lane from the right when the man suddenly
lost control.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he hit the wall, nothing came out of the driver's side,''
Worley said. ``I just saw sparks.''
</P>
<P>
   Worley was the first officer to approach the truck: ``When I
opened the door I didn't see any sign of the suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   It took deputies and officers a few seconds to realize what had
happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went up to get him, and there was no carjacker,'' Worley
said. ``But we saw the kids, and we just grabbed them and got them
out real quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Worley said the impact apparently caused the man's body to act
like a missile that shot out through the passenger-side window.
</P>
<P>
   As television newscasts carried the incident live from
helicopter cameras, Worley could be seen holding the oldest child,
Christopher, trying to comfort him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a 4-year-old, and his name is Christopher, too. I
just wanted to reassure him he was OK,'' Worley said. ``I told him
the bad guy's gone. He's not going to get you.''
</P>
<P>
   Worley said the child began to cry for his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's when I started to cry,'' Worley said. ``I've worked
with dope dealers and dead bodies. I see the kids at the worst
times, and I can't do anything for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I could do something. I wasn't going to let him go.''
</P>
<P>
   A paramedic said two of the kids said they were asleep when the
chase began but were badly frightened as it went on.
</P>
<P>
   The children's father, Jesus Aguilar, who was at work when the
incident occurred, arrived at the hospital shortly after the
children.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Janine Mazabob, operations administrator for
the hospital, said the children suffered only cuts and bruises, and
were released shortly after 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez received a more serious head injury, which needed stitches
and required a CAT scan, Mazabob said. She said Lopez would likely
be released from the hospital by Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Claudia Aguilar, who watched the chase on the hair salon's TV,
told reporters before heading for the hospital, ``I'm so glad she
was with them, to hold them through this.'' Added the children's
father about Lopez, ``She's my hero.''

UNSUNG HEROES RALLY TO HELP VICTIMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY STEVE CARNEY, JESSE HIESTAND AND LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ First came shock _ a gunman was attacking a
cluster of children before his eyes. Then instinct kicked in for
19-year-old Victor Ruelas, who ignored danger and carried a wounded
6-year-old boy to safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't sure what was going on,'' Ruelas, a maintenance
worker at the Jewish Community Center in Granada Hills, said
Wednesday. ``A lot of things were going through my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the aftermath of one man's villainy, Ruelas was among the
scores of people who emerged as heroes _ people who rose above the
norm to help victims of the bloodshed at the Community Center and
on a Chatsworth postal route.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a team effort,'' said Dr. Clarence Sutton Jr., the
surgeon at Providence Holy Cross Hospital who treated the most
critical victim, a 5-year-old boy gushing blood and near death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a great team of physicians, nurses, ancillary staff,
as well as paramedics and firemen, who bring it all together.''
</P>
<P>
   But before those professionals ever got drawn into the swirl of
violence, Ruelas watched agape as the gunman fired indiscriminately
at a knot of 10 children, ages 6 to 8, readying to board a bus for
a field trip.
</P>
<P>
   In the bedlam that followed, he came across a 6-year-old named
Josh wounded in the calf. Josh managed to crawl about 20 feet down
a hallway and outside the building before collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met him outside and carried him to the school house,''
Ruelas said. ``He couldn't walk. He was in pain and I was running,
saying `Call 911.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He was being brave. He wasn't crying or yelling. He just
wanted his mom. He said it hurt. So I took off his shoes and put
pressure on his leg and went back outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruelas headed back to the building, even though he didn't know
if the gunman remained inside. He said it was simply an instinct to
make sure the other children were OK.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman was gone, and the other victims were already safe.
But they needed help.
</P>
<P>
   A 68-year-old receptionist, a 16-year-old counselor and a second
6-year-old boy had been shot. But most serious was a 5-year-old hit
in the abdomen and the leg, who was losing blood fast.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Carb was the first paramedic to reach him, after the
chilling radio call at 10:49 a.m. sent him to the center:
``shooting at a school with machine-gun fire. Shooting at Jewish
Community Center.''
</P>
<P>
   He raced through a hallway when he arrived, stepping over broken
glass and about 70 spent shell casings. Then he saw a woman
screaming for help, bending over a child covered in blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not talking at all and had no color at all to him,'' he
said. ``I started to work on him and I looked up for a moment and
his eyes rolled back. I absolutely thought that I had lost him.''
</P>
<P>
   Carb shook the boy and said, ``Don't you do that. You just
scared me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, I need to get this kid going now. He was literally
dying before our eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of opting for a helicopter that could take 10 minutes to
land and another 10 minutes to fly the boy to Childrens Hospital
Los Angeles, Carb opted for a ground ambulance to Holy Cross. One
of only two trauma centers in the Valley, it was just down Rinaldi
Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not going to survive an air flight to Childrens,'' he
said. ``He needed intervention now.''
</P>
<P>
   Emergency room nurse Cathy Carter was directing Carb and the
other paramedics to Holy Cross via radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell it was very chaotic there,'' she said. ``It
sounded like he had run in there to get the child. We didn't know
how many more were coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Carb was concerned _ he couldn't get a blood pressure reading,
nor give the boy an IV. His veins were too flat from losing more
than 30 percent of his blood. As the boy lapsed in and out of
consciousness, Carb gave him oxygen, covered him with a blanket and
gently spoke encouraging words to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't take kindly to losing patients,'' Carb said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had gone to another hospital, he probably would have
died,'' said Dr. Charles Deng, the Holy Cross emergency-room
physician who began caring for the boy when he arrived at 11:08
a.m. ``He was losing a lot of blood. Five minutes or 10 minutes can
make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they opened up his belly, there was blood everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Before they wheeled the boy into into surgery at 11:26, the 15
doctors and nurses swarming over him gave him a breathing tube and
IVs, and started replacing some of the blood he lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard. It's a kid,'' Deng said. ``A lot of people here
have kids. But you know you have to focus on the patient, or you
could lose the patient if anybody freezes up.''
</P>
<P>
   Carb said it was after he dropped off the boy he had a chance to
reflect on the shooting, glancing at the still-bloody gurney while
heading back to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked the other guys, What kind of monster would do
something like this?'' he said. ``I started feeling the anger.
Aside from the fact that somebody randomly shoots innocent people,
it hits a personal chord because I'm Jewish too.''
