<HEADLINE> Leslie Nielsen TV Ad Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- A Dutch television commercial  
starring Leslie Nielsen has been criticized for its portrayal of 
mental patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The country's Commercial Code Commission ruled Thursday that the  
commercials for mobile telephone company Dutchtone are distasteful 
and unnecessarily harmful. 
</P>
<P>
	The spot, set in a fictional mental hospital, is intended to  
poke fun at the complications of mobile telephone deals by 
suggesting they can drive people insane. One of the patients claims 
to be Napoleon. 
</P>
<P>
	Dutchtone's offices were closed Friday and officials were  
unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling came after the head of a psychiatric hospital  
complained.

<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Three captured U.S. soldiers faced  
charges today in Kosovo, where NATO continued its bombing campaign 
against Serb targets in hopes of halting reported mass expulsions 
of ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	With the capture of three U.S. soldiers and trainloads of  
refugees reportedly being forced out of Kosovo, the allies have 
said bombardment of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's forces 
would proceed until he agrees to a peace deal granting autonomy to 
the southern province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic. 
</P>
<P>
	The three grim-faced U.S. soldiers, part of a NATO peacekeeping  
force in neighboring Macedonia, were shown on Serbian television 
Thursday dressed in camouflage, with bruises or abrasions on their 
faces. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tanjug state news agency reported the three would face  
military court proceedings today, but it was unclear when the 
proceedings would take place. The charges were not immediately 
known. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said a Yugoslav  
court-martial of the three would violate international law. 
</P>
<P>
	The NATO bombardment of targets in Yugoslavia continued, though  
it was deterred by what officials called poor weather that 
prevented some planes from carrying out missions. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO missiles hit an army barracks today in the town of Vranje  
in southeastern Serbia, state television reported. Initial reports 
said there were no casualties at the barracks, located in a 
populated area. 
</P>
<P>
	A Serb farmer was killed and his brother injured early today  
when a missile struck their house in the northern Kosovo village of 
Kursumlija, Tanjug reported. It said the house was near a power 
station, and speculated the station was the likely target. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbian television reported that 200 refugees, mostly Serbs,  
Turks, Gypsies and some Albanians from the northern Kosovo town of 
Kosovska Mitrovica, arrived in Belgrade by train early today to 
escape ``the terrorists and NATO.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of refugees also poured out of Kosovo with stories of  
an apparent Serb campaign that NATO officials contend is aimed at 
altering forever the ethnic makeup of the province. More than 
180,000 refugees have overwhelmed neighboring territories in the 
past week. 
</P>
<P>
	Two trains jammed with more than 10,000 people arrived Thursday  
at the Macedonian border, where U.N. refugee officials described 
scenes of pandemonium. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were ... crammed on to the train like sardines,'' said  
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees spokeswoman Judith Kumin in 
Geneva. ``Two old people died in the crush and three women gave 
birth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least eight cruise missiles were fired from U.S. ships in the  
Adriatic about midnight Thursday, and the Pentagon dispatched a 
dozen F-117A stealth fighters to the region to join 11 of the 
radar-evading planes already operating over Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbian TV showed footage of what it said were abandoned  
strongholds of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army -- mostly houses 
fortified with sandbags -- in Dragobilje, Ovcarevo, Obrinje, Prekaz, 
Lapasnica, Pagarusa, Malisevo and Cicavica. 
</P>
<P>
	Dragobilje is where U.S. envoys met KLA leaders for negotiations  
over the past year. Prekaz was one of the birthplaces of the 
rebellion. Until late last summer, Malisevo was a major KLA 
stronghold. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Albanian capital, Tirana, KLA official Jakup Krasniqi  
told reporters Thursday night that the rebels were helping NATO 
bombing operations in Kosovo by locating targets. He gave no 
further details. 
</P>
<P>
	In a clear warning to remaining KLA rebels in the province, the  
Yugoslav army ordered all Kosovo Albanians to surrender weapons or 
face ``rigorous and unmerciful measures,'' the private Beta news 
agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview on ABC ``Nightline'' broadcast Thursday,  
Krasniqi said that after recent developments, the only possible 
solution would be independence for the majority ethnic Albanian 
province. 
</P>
<P>
	He also insisted that the KLA would not be ``extinguished or  
mopped out by the Serb forces,'' and said the rebels would launch 
an offensive ``in the next few days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo has been wracked by war since Milosevic launched a  
campaign against separatist ethnic Albanian rebels in February 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In Belgrade on Thursday, Milosevic met with ethnic Albanian  
leader Ibrahim Rugova, who called for peace. The meeting was 
denounced by other ethnic Albanian leaders, and it was not clear 
whether Rugova was speaking freely. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic remained defiant, saying his country ``is leading a  
just battle, defending its citizens ... and will never give up its 
land and freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Moscow, Russian President Boris Yeltsin appealed for an end  
to the airstrikes and was considering sending more Russia warships 
to the Mediterranean. His government earlier announced a Russian 
naval vessel would depart for the region today. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's top military officer, said the  
missile and bombing raids had hit targets all over Yugoslavia, 
particularly air defenses, communication networks, military 
compounds and Serb forces carrying out attacks in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	But he acknowledged that NATO air power alone cannot stop  
alleged Serb atrocities being committed on the ground. He said it 
was up to NATO's political leaders to decide how to respond. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav authorities call the NATO bombing a violation of  
international law and said refugees were fleeing Kosovo because of 
NATO attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, the emissary of Pope John Paul II, French  
Archbishop Jean-Louis Tauran, met with Milosevic and called for the 
NATO attacks to halt in time for Easter. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO officials previously ruled out suspending the bombing  
campaign for Easter celebrations, which start today in the Western 
Christian Church. The Orthodox Church, to which most Serbs belong, 
celebrates Easter a week later.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Assess Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the tales of Kosovo refugees grow more  
harrowing, President Clinton is dispatching a trusted aide to the 
Balkans and meeting with advisers and private aid officials to 
assess the U.S. response to the spreading humanitarian crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president wanted to get a full briefing both from his own  
government and the international organizations who are dealing with 
the humanitarian issues,'' said David Leavy, spokesman for the 
National Security Council. ``He wants to know what's being done and 
what more needs to be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has sent $91 million in humanitarian aid to  
the region since last year. On Wednesday Clinton authorized another 
$50 million in support and directed the Pentagon to airlift food 
and other supplies to the countries neighboring the Kosovo province 
that are being swamped with refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	By Thursday, at least more than 190,000 Kosovo Albanians had  
fled the country since NATO airstrikes on Serb forces began March 
24. Many were forced into train cars at gunpoint. Others made the 
tearful trek on foot. 
</P>
<P>
	International organizations rushed to get more supplies to the  
refugees, while Western European nations met in an emergency 
conference in Bonn, Germany, to promise more aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S.-based AmeriCares disaster relief organization flew a  
relief flight to Skopje, Macedonia, to distribute medical supplies, 
and it planned four more flights in the next week. The Red Cross 
has been handling some of the U.S.-funded relief. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials and representatives from the U.S. Agency for  
International Development, which has sent disaster relief teams to 
Macedonia and Albania, were expected at the session in the Cabinet 
room today with officials from independent groups. 
</P>
<P>
	While there was a growing sense that NATO was failing to keep up  
with the flow of refugees, Leavy said the meeting was called to 
``make sure that everything is coordinated properly, that we are 
ahead of the curve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James Rubin said the seven-member  
USAID team dispatched Wednesday to Albania would immediately assess 
``the nutritional and health status of refugees, provide health 
care support, and provide recommendations for additional government 
support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the agency has moved crucial materials from warehouses  
in Italy to the Balkans, including $260,000 in tents, clothing and 
water to Albania and $430,000 in blankets, shelter material and 
health kits to Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Clinton dispatched Deputy Secretary of State Strobe  
Talbott to assess the affect of the Kosovo crisis on neighboring 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement issued by the White House said Talbott would lead an  
interagency delegation to Albania, Macedonia and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``The deputy secretary will thank these countries for their  
support of the NATO operation in Kosovo and underscore the U.S. 
commitment to provide support necessary to address the impact of 
the unfolding humanitarian, security and economic crisis in the 
region,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton on Thursday spoke to sailors, airmen and their families  
at the Norfolk Naval Base. His visit came a day after three U.S. 
Army soldiers were seized by Serbs along the Yugoslav-Macedonian 
border. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Milosevic would be held responsible for safety of the  
three. 
</P>
<P>
	Returning to the White House, Clinton called British Prime  
Minister Tony Blair and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder to 
confer with them about the latest developments in the NATO 
campaign.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Expands Tree Quarantine List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Agriculture Department extended  
restrictions Friday on shipments of Christmas trees and other pine 
products from parts of six Eastern and Midwestern states. 
</P>
<P>
	New rules to prevent the spread of a tree-munching beetle were  
published Friday in the Federal Register, the government's bulletin 
of administrative regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules affirm emergency regulations issued Dec. 29 to add 19  
counties in Indiana, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and 
West Virginia to the quarantined area. Other counties in those six 
states, Illinois, Maryland and Wisconsin are covered under previous 
orders. 
</P>
<P>
	The department said the biggest impact will be on three  
Christmas tree farms in southwestern Pennsylvania's Blair and 
Greene counties. 
</P>
<P>
	The farms, which were not named, shipped all their trees and  
tree products outside the quarantined area in 1997, the government 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pine shoot beetle, an insect the size of a match head, can  
cause stunted and distorted growth in pine trees. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Europe, the beetle was discovered at a Christmas  
tree farm near Cleveland in 1992. Since then, the Agriculture 
Department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has sought 
to restrict its spread. 
</P>
<P>
	The restrictions, which apply only to interstate shipments,  
require businesses that want to ship outside the regulated areas to 
arrange for inspections and subject their products to special 
fumigation or cold treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspections are provided without charge, but businesses face  
treatment and other costs and possible marketing delays.

<HEADLINE> Whitewater Witness Testifies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Susan McDougal's defense got an unusual  
endorsement Friday from another woman charged by Kenneth Starr's 
prosecutors. Julie Hiatt Steele testified that she, too, was 
indicted because she refused to give false testimony against 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele has been charged with lying to grand jurors  
investigating former White House volunteer Kathleen Willey's claim 
that Clinton made an unwelcome sexual advance toward her in 1993. 
Ms. Steele's testimony undercut part of Mrs. Willey's account. 
</P>
<P>
	A trial is scheduled to start May 3 in Alexandria, Va., on  
charges filed by Independent Counsel Starr's staff that Ms. Steele 
obstructed justice and made false statements. She testified in the 
McDougal case against the advice of her lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came here today because Susan and I have both been  
relentlessly pursued by the Office of Independent Counsel,'' Ms. 
Steele told reporters after spending two hours on the witness 
stand. ``The people ... need to know this, and that it could happen 
to anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, charged with refusing to answer questions before  
a grand jury investigating her Whitewater land partnership with the 
Clintons, contends she feared testifying because prosecutors out to 
get the Clintons pressured her to lie. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Mark Geragos said Ms. Steele's testimony showed  
Mrs. McDougal was not alone in feeling strong-armed by the 
independent counsel's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the courtroom, Geragos contended prosecutors  
aggressively pursued Ms. Steele even after she passed a lie 
detector test and Clinton's accuser, Mrs. Willey, failed one. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors accepted Mrs. Willey's word ``because they liked her  
story,'' Geragos said. He could not say who administered the 
polygraph tests or offer more detail about the results. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele's attorneys have asserted in court in Virginia that  
polygraph test results undermine the credibility of some 
prosecution witnesses, but they did not elaborate and would not 
comment Friday. Polygraph tests are seldom admissible in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey's lawyer, Daniel Gecker, did not return telephone  
calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele, 52, of Richmond, Va., said that after testifying  
before two grand juries, she was ``invited to a secret meeting at 
the office of the independent counsel to clarify my testimony. I 
believed I was to support Kathleen Willey's version of the story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, she said, ``I couldn't do it. I left the meeting in tears.  
I didn't know anything to tell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele said despite what she considered her minor role in  
the case, which grew out of the Monica Lewinsky investigation, 
prosecutors questioned one of her daughters, her brother, her 
former attorney and her neighbors and friends. Ms. Steele said she 
was upset that some family members also were asked about the 
adoption of her son Adam, now 8, from Romania. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to a prosecutor's questions, Ms. Steele acknowledged  
that she first told a reporter for Newsweek magazine a story that 
supported Willey's account, then recanted. She admitted that within 
days of talking to the Newsweek reporter, she sold a photograph of 
Clinton and Mrs. Willey to the National Enquirer for $9,000. She 
said she needed the money for her son's special-needs schooling. 
</P>
<P>
	And she conceded that Starr's office never actually investigated  
her son's adoption. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey has said she confided in Ms. Steele about the  
Clinton encounter right after it happened, which Ms. Steele denies. 
Prosecutor Julie Myers told Ms. Steele during testimony that the 
government has evidence that Ms. Steele was told the story in 1993: 
statements by her friends who say she shared the tale with them. 
</P>
<P>
	As the trial ended its fourth week, Ms. Steele was the latest in  
a series of unusual witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempting to put the focus on Starr's tactics, the defense  
summoned Starr's top deputy, W. Hickman Ewing Jr., to the stand as 
its first witness. Prosecutors called a former grand juror and 
showed year-old videotaped testimony by first lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge George Howard has allowed uncommon testimony  
because Mrs. McDougal's defense depends on an assessment of 
prosecutors' conduct.

<HEADLINE> Pavarotti Returns to Las Vegas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Famed tenor Luciano Pavarotti says he doesn't  
know quite what to expect when he performs for a third time in Las 
Vegas next week. 
</P>
<P>
	But he knows there will be some roulette tables waiting to take  
his money again. 
</P>
<P>
	Pavarotti is to make a rare appearance in this gambling capital  
April 10, christening the 12,000-seat Mandalay Bay Resort &AMP; Casino 
Events Center. The concert will be his first here since March 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	He recalls being ``very comfortable'' with his Las Vegas  
audiences, and in the casino -- at least for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won a couple thousand dollars at roulette,'' he recalled  
this week. ``Then I lost it, like everybody does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pavarotti, 63, is having a good 1999 after undergoing hip and  
knee replacement surgery last year. In addition to solo 
engagements, he performed in Tokyo on Jan. 9 with Placido Domingo 
and Jose Carreras.

<HEADLINE> World Population To Hit 8 Billion in 2026 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The world's population, currently nearing 6  
billion, will climb to 8 billion by 2026, the Census Bureau 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
	And the total will reach 9.3 billion by 2050, the agency  
projected in a report released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The growth of human population has been, is now, and in the  
future will be almost entirely determined in the world's less 
developed countries,'' the Census report said. 
</P>
<P>
	It concluded that 99 percent of natural increase -- the  
difference between births and deaths -- occurs in the developing 
regions of Africa, Asia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	By early in the next century deaths will exceed births in the  
more developed nations and all of the net growth will be in 
developing countries, the report added. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's age structure also will shift, becoming  
progressively older, in coming years with the population of those 
aged 65 and over more than doubling while the number of those under 
age 15 will grow by 6 percent.

<P>
	BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- Plains residents braced for more stormy  
weather today after more than a foot of snow blanketed parts of the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Black Hills in South Dakota, Deadwood got 13 inches of  
snow Thursday and nearby Lead received about a foot. In North 
Dakota, Bismarck and Dickinson both received 9 inches of snow. 
</P>
<P>
	A winter storm watch was still in effect for parts of North  
Dakota, and as much as 6 inches of snow were possible by tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow wasn't the only problem. Wind and freezing rain downed  
power lines in eastern North Dakota, causing outages for as many as 
4,000 customers, said Bonnie Lund, a spokeswoman for Northern 
States Power. 
</P>
<P>
	Crews worked throughout the night and called for reinforcements  
this morning for the Grand Forks area. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been kind of an up-and-down situation,'' NSP spokesman  
Terry Thorstensen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowed, broken tree limbs and branches covered city streets in  
Grand Forks, along with ice and frozen slush. Power was knocked out 
to nine sewer lift stations, and residents were being advised to 
reduce water use and plug basement sewer drains as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	Ice also knocked out a major electrical distribution line  
serving eastern North Dakota and western Minnesota, though back-up 
systems kept power on for most customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm made roads a mess. Melvin Walker was one of many  
truckers stranded at the Stamart Travel Center and Oasis Restaurant 
in Bismarck during Thursday's blizzard. He could only look out a 
truck stop window as he waited for his chance to deliver Washington 
state apples to Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	``You couldn't even see -- freezing rain, snow was blowing. It  
was just terrible,'' the truck driver from Ohio said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kent Kibbel watched the snow from his home in Mott, in  
southwestern North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just holed up,'' he said. ``We can't even see out the  
window. It's not even fit for a dog to be out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The storm couldn't have come at a worse time for ranchers in the  
middle of calving season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can see across the farmstead now and the yard, but that's  
about it,'' said Steve Sprenger, who has about 225 cattle near 
Elgin. ``If you've got any cows that are calving -- if those cows 
aren't in the barn, they're going to be gone.''

<HEADLINE> Desert Hero Trainer Aiming High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Desert Hero has raced only twice, and not  
farther than a mile. 
</P>
<P>
	Not to worry, says Corey Nakatani, who will ride the colt  
Saturday in the Santa Anita Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's like an old pro,'' Nakatani said after Desert Hero and  
seven other 3-year-olds were entered Thursday for the 1 1/8-mile Santa 
Anita Derby, a major steppingstone to the Kentucky Derby on May 1 
at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Dick Mandella also likes what he's seen of Desert Hero,  
although he didn't see either of the colt's races. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a chance to get a couple of good works in him at  
seven-eighths and a mile,'' Mandella said. ``He does everything 
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mandella got Desert Hero after the colt beat Prime Timber by a  
neck in the 1-mile San Rafael on Feb. 29 at Santa Anita. The colt, 
owned by Prince Ahmed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, was taken away 
from trainer Wally Dollase, Nakatani's father-in-law. A 
philosophical difference was cited as the reason for the change. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandella said he would watch a tape of the San Rafael before  
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nakatani and Mandella aren't the only ones impressed by Desert  
Hero, who made his racing debut by winning a 6 1/2-furlong maiden race 
Feb. 7. The colt was made the 5-2 early favorite, followed by 
General Challenge (3-1) and Prime Timber (7-2) and the filly Honest 
Lady (4-1). 
</P>
<P>
	Desert Hero is the son of Sea Hero, the 1993 Kentucky Derby  
winner. 
</P>
<P>
	General Challenge and Prime Timber are trained by Bob Baffert,  
who finished 1-2 with Indian Charlie and Real Quiet in last year's 
Santa Anita Derby and who won the last two Kentucky derbies, with 
Silver Charm and Real Quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought Prime Timber would be the favorite off his last race  
(a two-length win in the San Felipe on March 13),'' Baffert said. 
``He ran an incredible race. If he runs that race back, he's a 
galloping winner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Timber, a winner of three of five career starts, with two  
seconds, wore blinkers for the first time in the San Felipe. 
</P>
<P>
	General Challenge, a gelding, will wear blinkers for the first  
time Saturday in his first start since he finished fifth in 1 
1-16-mile Louisiana Derby on March 14, his only loss in four 
starts. He wore blinkers for a workout March 23 at Santa Anita and 
sizzled five-eighths of a mile in 57 3-5 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Since General challenge is owned by John and Betty Mabee and  
Prime Timber is owned by Aaron and Marie Jones, they will not race 
as an entry. 
</P>
<P>
	Honest Lady, winner of two of three starts, will be facing colts  
for the second time. She finished fifth in the San Rafael, but was 
only one length behind winner Desert Hero. She is stabled at 
Hollywood Park in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
	Only three fillies have won the Santa Anita Derby, and only  
three have won the Kentucky Derby. Winning Colors, in 1988, was the 
last filly to win either race. 
</P>
<P>
	Post time for the $750,000 Santa Anita Derby, to be televised by  
Fox, is 2:40 p.m. PST. 
</P>
<P>
	The field in post-position order is Honest Lady, ridden by Kent  
Desormeaux; Prime Timber, David Flores; Desert Hero, Nakatani; 
Capsized, Alex Solis; Walk That Walk, Chris Antley; High Wire Act, 
Chris McCarron; General Challenge, Gary Stevens, and Charismatic, 
Laffit Pincay Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Capsized is trained by Lisa Lewis, only the fifth woman to train  
a Santa Anita Derby starter.

<HEADLINE> Arco Finds Put Alaska on Oil Map </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- When Richfield Oil Corp. arrived in  
Alaska, the only locally produced oil came from fish. 
</P>
<P>
	The year was 1955, and Alaska was still a federal territory  
fighting to become a state. Opposition to statehood was strong in 
Washington, D.C., largely because it wasn't clear that sprawling, 
thinly populated Alaska could support itself. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1957, Richfield's first Alaska well was in the Cook Inlet  
area, and it came in as a gusher. The worry about self-sufficiency 
ebbed, and the following year Congress voted overwhelmingly to make 
Alaska the 49th state. 
</P>
<P>
	The success at Swanson River marked the beginning of a  
four-decade relationship that produced huge riches for both the 
state and the company, whose name had been changed to Atlantic 
Richfield Co. when it discovered the real bonanza -- Prudhoe Bay, 
the largest oil field ever found in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could say Alaska made Arco, and Arco certainly had a  
pervasive impact on the state,'' said Gil Mull, a former Richfield 
geologist. 
</P>
<P>
	Those heady days are long gone for Arco, and soon its name will  
be, too. The company, pounded hard by prolonged low prices, was 
swallowed by BP Amoco PLC this week for $25.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which still must be approved by regulators, won't be  
final until the end of the year. In the meantime, Arco will 
continue as its own company, but in the minds of former workers and 
others in Alaska, the obituary has already been printed. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us feel some loss,'' said Harold Heinze, a former Arco  
president in Alaska. ``Though I probably feel a little more for the 
current employees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're losing a hell of a friend,'' said former Gov. Walter  
Hickel. 
</P>
<P>
	Losing Arco would leave BP Amoco as the only company operating  
on the North Slope, which accounts for more than one-sixth of the 
nation's oil production. BP Amoco would control more than 70 
percent of Alaska's crude output, and have a similar stake in the 
800-mile trans-Alaska oil pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco now pumps far more oil off the North Slope, but Arco  
was seen as having the better prospects by virtue of being a more 
vigorous explorer. 
</P>
<P>
	What worries some in oil-dependent Alaska is that the loss of  
Arco as a North Slope competitor could mean less hunting for new 
fields there. 
</P>
<P>
	``BP has always gone for the elephants,'' said Jack Roderick,  
whose book ``Crude Dreams'' chronicled Alaska's oil history. ``Do 
they have the incentive to move out from what they know? They 
haven't done it yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``BP has not been the real aggressive organization in frontier  
exploration,'' said Mull, who now works for the state. ``Most of 
the major discoveries, I think, are made by smaller companies 
willing to step out and do outrageous things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outrageous would describe Arco's devotion to the North Slope in  
the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	The region's geology had attracted a lot of interest, but no one  
could find any oil -- more than a dozen expensive holes were 
drilled, and every one of them dry. 
</P>
<P>
	Cash-strapped Richfield was getting ready to join the corporate  
exodus in the spring of 1967. But the company decided to drill one 
more well at an obscure place called Prudhoe Bay, and ended up 
driving the bit down into an oil reservoir that has so far yielded 
more than 10 billion barrels of crude. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this had been a dry hole, the North Slope would have been  
dead for a few years,'' said retired Arco geologist Marvin Mangus, 
who helped choose the Prudhoe Bay drill site. ``Maybe it would 
still be dead.'' BP was among those ready to pack it in when Arco 
drilled the Prudhoe Bay discovery well. Arco had offered to buy its 
Prudhoe acreage for a good price, but apparently pushed a little 
too hard to close the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	A suspicious BP held out and soon came news of the discovery. It  
started drilling wells and, as luck would have it, the largest 
share of the oil lay under its land.

<HEADLINE> Courier Ready for Davis Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) -- For Jim Courier, meeting Tim Henman  
before 9,400 screaming British fans was no big deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't misunderstand, Courier likes the fact that the United  
States and Britain are meeting again in the Davis Cup, just as they 
did 99 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	And he said he was proud to be representing his country again.  
</P>
<P>
	Other than that, ``for us it's pretty much business as usual,''  
he said on the eve of the match. ``We have a job to do, we come 
here, we prepare and try to do the job and that's it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It may be a little bit more, certainly for Britain, and British  
captain David Lloyd is unconvinced by Courier's assertion that it's 
just another match. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe that,'' Lloyd said. ``I think it's going to be  
very special. We want to win the cup. There's no two ways about it 
and it's a very big occasion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lloyd revealed that, at dinner on Wednesday, Courier and the  
rest of the players took the rare step of signing each others menus 
to keep as mementos. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't keep a Key Biscayne memento,'' the British captain  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain is back in the World Group after a seven-year spell in  
the tennis doldrums and the two nations who first contested the 
Davis Cup at the Longwood Cricket Club in Boston in 1900 meet 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, the Americans have won the title a record 31 times,  
while the last of Britain's nine titles was in 1936 against 
Australia. Britain's last victory over the Americans was in 1935. 
</P>
<P>
	After Henman vs. Courier, Greg Rusedski went against Todd  
Martin, who has leapfrogged him in the rankings and now is No. 8. 
</P>
<P>
	The same British duo face Courier and Alex O'Brien in Saturday's  
doubles. Sunday's matches are Henman against Martin followed by 
Rusedski vs. Courier, and the winner of the tie faces either 
Zimbabwe or Australia in the next round. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. captain Tom Gullikson initially tried to persuade world No.  
1 Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi to play, but they declined. But 
he's confident that Courier, Martin, Jan-Michael Gambill and 
O'Brien is now the strongest team available to him. He pointed out 
that Courier and Martin had an 11-2 record against Henman and 
Rusedski in tournament play. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have got guys who are very good against Henman and Rusedski  
and I have no reason to think that it won't be different this 
week,'' Gullikson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin said he was hopeful that his injured stomach muscle had  
recovered enough for him to serve at full strength on a surface he 
described as on the fast side of medium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had it a couple of months, probably since I played Petr  
Korda in the Australian Open at Melbourne'' he said. ``It's not as 
huge liability. My only concern now is how well I recover from 
Friday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other six World Group ties have defending titlist Sweden  
against Slovakia, Germany vs. Russia, France vs. Netherlands, Spain 
vs. Brazil, Belgium vs. Czech Republic and Switzerland against last 
year's runner up, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis Cup champion Sweden begins defense of its title in a  
small, 2,500-capacity hall with no TV coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have absolutely nothing against Trollhattan (the city where  
the match against Slovakis is taking place),'' Swedish star Thomas 
Enqvist said. ``But it's a sign of weakness to play in such a small 
hall. By having a match here, one's status is drawn down a 
little.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Enqvist and Thomas Johansson are playing singles, with Nicklas  
Kulti teaming with Jonas Bjorkman in doubles. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany, which entertains Russia at Frankfurt's Ballsporthalle,  
hasn't won the title since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Boris Becker teams in doubles with David Prinosil, while  
Germany's singles hopes rest with Nicolas Kiefer and Tommy Haas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians send Australian Open champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov  
against Kiefer and Marat Safin against Haas. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia goes to Harare to face Zimbabwe with a feud still  
hanging over the team between Mark Philippoussis and captain John 
Newcombe. 
</P>
<P>
	It dates to last year's loss to the Zimbabweans when  
Philippousis declined to play and relations between the two have 
been cool ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be silly to say we're one big happy family,'' said  
Newcombe, who sends Philippousis out to play Byron Black and 
Patrick Rafter to face Wayne Black. 
</P>
<P>
	``But there's no bitterness in our approach. I don't think  
there'll be any problems. And if we win here it will do a lot to 
help forget about the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Winner of the Lipton Championship last weekend, Dutchman Richard  
Krajicek hopes to transfer his impressive tournament form over to 
the Davis Cup where he has won only four of 11 singles matches. 
</P>
<P>
	Krajicek faces Jerome Golmard in the match against France at  
Nimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Haarhuis meets Cedric Pioline, then teams with Jan  
Siemerink in Saturday's doubles against Golmard and Guillaume 
Raoux. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's former French Open champion, Gustavo Kuerten, meets  
Spain's Alex Corretja in today's singles before facing Carlos Moya 
on Sunday in the Spanish town of Lleida. 
</P>
<P>
	At Gent, Belgium, the Czech Republic's Slava Dosedel plays Filip  
Dewulf and Bohdan Ulihrach faces Xavier Malisse. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy, the losing finalist last year to Sweden, travels to  
Switzerland, with Davide Sanguinetti meeting Marc Rosset and 
Gianluca Pozzi facing Roger Federer in today's matches.

<HEADLINE> Hurdler Bryan Bronson Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) -- Bryan Bronson, the world's top-ranked  
400-meter hurdler the past two years and winner of three straight 
U.S. championships, was suspended by track and field's governing 
body for a failed drug test. 
</P>
<P>
	The test came at a Grand Prix meet last July 14 in Rome, the  
International Amateur Athletic Federation said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri said the 26-year-old hurdler from  
Houston was suspended March 19 after his urine sample contained 
``abnormal steroid concentrations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bronson was not immediately available for comment. Kim Betts of  
USA Track &AMP; Field's legal department said, ``We can't comment on an 
athlete's eligibility matters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Pelletier, who was Bronson's agent, said he couldn't comment  
pending final action by USATF, which will review the case. Kim 
Wrinkle, the hurdler's former coach, said, ``If it's true, it's a 
shame. It's an incredible waste of talent. He's a tremendous 
athlete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pelletier said his relationship with Bronson ended Wednesday  
because of ``lack of communications'' the last few months. Wrinkle 
said he hasn't been in touch with Bronson since July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``He broke off relations with his friends, his relatives, his  
teammates, his coach, with everybody,'' Wrinkle said. ``He's done 
that before. He's a very private person. He goes into periods of 
seclusion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bronson was the bronze medalist at the 1997 world championships  
in Athens, Greece, and ran the third-fastest time in history (47.03 
seconds) in winning the national championship at New Orleans last 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	Reineri said Bronson was not suspended immediately after the  
positive test because a letter from his doctor and lawyer said he 
had a ``medical problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Some positive doping tests are closed when there is a genetic  
or medical explanation,'' Reineri said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reineri said Bronson was allowed to compete last summer despite  
the test. He reached the Grand Prix final at Moscow in September -- 
undefeated in the Golden League series and unbeaten in 17 races 
overall in 1998 -- but lost in the final. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have waited for a further, complete medical report from  
him,'' Reineri said. ``We have not received it and have decided to 
suspend him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bronson is the third elite track and field athlete suspended in  
recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Vita Pavlysh of Ukraine won the women's shot put gold medal at  
last month's world indoor championships and lost the title after a 
failed drug test. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's Doug Walker, the European 200 champion, was suspended  
by his country's ruling track body following a positive test for 
the anabolic steroid Nandrolone.

<HEADLINE> Jury Dismisses Marine Navigator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- The navigator of a Marine Corps jet  
that cut an Italian gondola cable, killing 20 people, said he 
respects a jury's decision to discharge him for destroying a 
personal videotape shot on the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y., said Friday he  
harbored no bitterness against the Marine Corps and wants to ``wake 
up tomorrow and not have to deal with this for the first time in 14 
months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer had pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and  
conspiracy -- charges that carried up to 10 years in prison. He 
admitted throwing the tape into a fire two days after his jet 
clipped an Alpine gondola cable. He said he was afraid his face 
would be used on Italian media. 
</P>
<P>
	After deliberating about three hours, a jury of nine Marine  
officers recommended that Schweitzer be dismissed from the military 
-- the equivalent of a dishonorable discharge for an enlisted 
person. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys said they will seek to have the sentence  
reduced, to no punishment or a letter of reprimand. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentence isn't final until a commanding general reviews it  
and considers attorneys' pleadings. Once Lt. Gen. Peter Pace, 
commander of Marine Forces Atlantic, approves a sentence, it goes 
into the military appeals process. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer was the navigator, sitting in the right front seat,  
of an EA-6B Prowler that hit a gondola cable over Cavalese, Italy, 
on Feb. 3, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Manslaughter charges against him were dismissed after the pilot,  
Capt. Richard Ashby, was acquitted of manslaughter in March. Ashby, 
32, of Mission Viejo, Calif., still faces obstruction of justice 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer was using Ashby's camera during the low-level  
mountain training flight. After the jet's right wing was nearly 
sheared off by the cable, the jet made an emergency landing at its 
Aviano air base and the two men switched the tape before leaving 
the crippled jet. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Dave Beck said he will urge Pace to drop the  
charges against Ashby because it was Schweitzer who suggested 
getting rid of the tape, which he shot as a memento because he 
planned to leave the service and attend graduate school.

<HEADLINE> Orioles Get Conine From Kansas City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles, looking to add  
right-handed power, got Jeff Conine from the Kansas City Royals in 
a trade Friday for minor league pitcher Chris Fussell. 
</P>
<P>
	Conine, a two-time All-Star and MVP of the 1995 game while with  
Florida, hit .256 with eight home runs and 43 RBIs last season for 
Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	The first baseman-outfielder batted .321 with one homer and  
seven RBIs this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Conine, 32, has hit .310 against left-handed pitchers in the  
last five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jeff fills the final pressing need of our team,'' Orioles  
general manager Frank Wren said. ``He is a right-handed hitter with 
some versatility and he can bat in the middle of our lineup when 
necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles made the deal before their exhibition game at  
Atlanta. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Individual Stocks Took a Hit in 4th </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Ouch! Individual stocks can really hurt a porfolio when they  
take a fall. 
</P>
<P>
	A sample portfolio for small investors that The Associated Press  
has tracked since October 1997 eked out just a 1 percent gain 
during the first quarter, because two of its individual stock 
holdings, IBM and Coca-Cola, dropped on poor sales outlooks. By 
comparison, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 6.6 percent 
during the first three months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3.9 percent decline in IBM and the 8.4 percent slide in Coke  
nearly offset healthier returns posted by Wal-Mart and the mutual 
funds in the portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
	Volatility in individual stocks is the reason why millions of  
individual investors turn to mutual funds to diversify their 
holdings and cushion their portfolios against big losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP has followed the stock market's progress through the  
portfolio created at the close of trading on Oct. 23, 1997. The 
portfolio, consisting of three mutual funds and three widely held 
stocks, as of March 31 had increased 44.88 percent since its 
inception. 
</P>
<P>
	The portfolio was valued at $25,299.85 at its inception and was  
worth $36,654.91 as the first quarter ended. During the fourth 
quarter, the portfolio rose 27.38 percent, recovering from an 11.32 
percent drop in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	For the just-ended quarter, the portfolio's mutual funds turned  
in a respectable performance. The Vanguard Index Trust 500 
Portfolio fund, which tracks Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 large 
U.S. companies, rose 4.3 percent. The Morgan Stanley Dean Witter 
Pacific Growth Fund continued its recovery along with other funds 
with a big representation of Asian stocks. It rose 7.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The sole losing fund in the Portfolio was the T. Rowe Price U.S.  
Treasury Long-Term Fund, which fell 5.3 percent as investors 
switched from bonds to stocks to take advantage of Wall Street's 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart had the best return of of all the holdings in the  
portfolio, rising 13.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM fell during the quarter on news that its personal computer  
business was slumping. Coca-Cola dropped as it warned investors 
that its first-quarter sales volume would be disappointing.

<HEADLINE> Study Decries Mowed Lawns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- That sweet scent of a freshly mowed lawn may  
really be the smell of air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists studying the sources of chemicals in the air have  
found that injured grass gives off volatile compounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wounding, cutting and drying of leaves and stems occur both  
naturally and by human activities, wound-induced and drying-induced 
... compounds are expected to be significant in the atmosphere,'' a 
team of researchers says in a study scheduled to appear in a future 
issue of the journal Geophysical Research Letters. 
</P>
<P>
	``In urban areas, lawn mowing may contribute to the total ...  
emissions and impact air quality,'' the report says. 
</P>
<P>
	But do not panic. While total emissions from cutting grass and  
crops worldwide may seem large, it does not mean cutting the grass 
is dangerous for individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just doesn't seem likely to me that the smell of newly mown  
grass is toxic,'' said Ray Fall of the University of Colorado, a 
biochemist and one of the researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mowing the lawn is no more hazardous than eating raw  
vegetables,'' he added, pointing out that chewing veggies also 
releases tiny amounts of the same chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the grazing of animals can release these compounds into the  
air, he said: ``Every time a cow chomps grass you get these little 
surges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, Fall said the team was surprised at the variety of  
chemicals released when crops were cut and during the drying 
process, including methanol, hexanal, acetaldehyde, acetone and 
butatone. Some, such as acetone, can contribute to the formation of 
smog, the paper notes. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists estimate that cutting crops adds about 1.6  
million tons of acetone to the atmosphere annually, compared with 
estimated total natural emissions of 8 million to 13 million tons. 
They have not estimated the totals for other compounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers studied red fescue grass cut from a lawn near  
their laboratory in Boulder, Colo., and clover grown in a 
greenhouse. This summer they plan a study of alfalfa. 
</P>
<P>
	The Environmental Protection Agency has a laboratory in North  
Carolina looking at biological emissions of chemicals, but has not 
studied grass or clover. 
</P>
<P>
	The new report says that in addition to lawn mowing, chemicals  
are given off by drying plant material in arid areas and during the 
harvest in agricultural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can be expected that the resulting emissions have a  
significant impact on the chemistry of the atmosphere over these 
areas,'' said the report. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cut and drying organic material appears to be a significant  
global, and possibly regional, source of volatile organic 
compounds. One that we think may not have been well accounted for 
before,'' Carlton J. Howard of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration's Aeronomy Laboratory in Boulder said in a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard noted that emissions from lawn mowers and even barbecues  
have been identified as components of pollution in some urban areas 
and this study adds one more source of chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is something that needs to be looked at carefully,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Hits 29-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's unemployment rate fell to a  
29-year low of 4.2 percent in March, with Hispanics and high school 
dropouts among the groups registering the most dramatic 
improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a historic report,'' Labor Secretary Alexis Herman  
said Friday. ``It's an indication this is an economy that is 
lifting all boats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The improvement in the rate, from 4.4 percent in February, came  
despite the smallest seasonally adjusted increase in three years in 
the number of jobs -- 46,000. That's the fewest since an outright 
decline in payrolls in January 1996 when a blizzard struck the 
Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists also attributed most of the latest deceleration in  
job growth to the weather -- milder-than-usual conditions in 
February followed by heavy snow in many states in March -- rather 
than to any significant deterioration in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The slow growth in payrolls in March masks a firm underlying  
trend,'' said economist Joel Naroff, a consultant in Holland, Pa. 
``The economy remains in excellent shape ... when the weather 
effects are smoothed out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	March's unemployment rate was the lowest since February 1970,  
when it also was 4.2 percent. At that time, unemployment was 
actually increasing. An economic expansion that covered a ``good 
chunk'' of the 1960s -- when the unemployment rate dropped as low as 
3.4 percent -- had ended a few months earlier, said Tom Nardone, 
chief of labor force statistics at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the rate for Hispanics fell from 6.7 percent to 5.8  
percent, the lowest since the Labor Department began calculating a 
rate for the group in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	``These economic indicators are more than just economic  
indicators,'' President Clinton said at a news conference. ``They 
mean wider opportunity and a better chance for millions of 
Americans to have stronger families and give their children a 
better chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the rate for adults who dropped out of high school  
fell from 7.5 percent to 6.1 percent. Rates were unchanged for high 
school graduates, at 3.4 percent, and for college graduates, at 1.9 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people who used to be hiring college grads are  
setting their sites lower ... or if they were hiring high school 
grads, they're saying, 'I can get by with a high-school dropout.' 
They're the only people left to hire,'' said economist David Wyss 
of DRI's McGraw Hill in Lexington, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	The smaller-than-expected advance in payrolls in March followed  
gains of 297,000 in February and 217,000 in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers, many hit hard by the global economic slump that  
began in Asia near two years ago, cut 35,000 jobs last month, 
bringing the decline for the past year to 381,000. Over the past 
year, losses have been most severe at factories making industrial 
machinery, apparel and electrical equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction hiring fell by a seasonally adjusted 47,000 jobs in  
March after the actual gain in jobs fell short of the normal 
advance for the start of spring. Bureau of Labor Statistics 
Commissioner Katharine Abraham said construction workers that 
normally would have been hired in March were already on the 
payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	Mining, which includes oil-drilling, lost 7,000 jobs in March,  
bringing losses over the past year to 55,000. Agricultural services 
and real estate also recorded declines. 
</P>
<P>
	Hiring at restaurants and bars fell on a seasonally adjusted  
basis, too. Wyss said that may partly reflect restaurant owners' 
difficulty in finding help. 
</P>
<P>
	Robust employment growth continued in engineering and management  
services, health care, educational services and amusement and 
recreation. There also were gains in computer and data processing 
and finance and insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	By demographic group, in addition to the drop for Hispanics, the  
jobless rate fell from 3.8 percent to 3.6 percent for whites, from 
8.3 percent to 8.1 percent for blacks and from 3.7 percent to 3.2 
percent for men. It rose from 3.8 percent to 3.9 percent for women 
and from 14.1 percent to 14.3 percent for teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
	Average hourly earnings for non-farm, non-supervisory workers  
rose a modest 3 cents in March to $13.09. They're up 3.6 percent 
from a year earlier. The average workweek declined by a tenth of an 
hour to 34.5 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The inflation-wary bond market was cheered by the small rise in  
wages because it reinforced the view that the Federal Reserve need 
not raise interest rates to quell inflation pressures. The yield on 
the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell to 5.60 percent from 5.67 
percent late Thursday. The stock market was closed for Good Friday.

<HEADLINE> Inprise Group Execs Quit Suddenly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTS VALLEY, Calif. (AP) -- Without notice or explanation, the  
chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Inprise 
Corp. -- which was Borland International until last year -- have quit 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The resignations of CEO Delbert Yocam, a well-regarded veteran  
of Apple Computer Inc., and financial officer Kathleen Fisher 
raised concerns among financial analysts about the company, which 
makes software for businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Usually there's only one thing that would cause a CFO to leave  
like this, and that's if a (financial) tidal wave that would wreck 
their career was headed toward the company,'' said Giga Information 
analyst Rob Enderle in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	Inprise board members told analysts Thursday they were surprised  
by the resignations and had no definitive plan for recruiting 
successors. Board members also told analysts the two executives 
were not forced out. 
</P>
<P>
	Borland International was founded in 1983 by Philippe Kahn, who  
hoped to challenge Microsoft in the market for consumer software. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, the company struggled to establish itself as a  
developer of application server software like IBM or Oracle Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Borland was renamed Inprise last April in an attempt to revive  
the company's ailing reputation and business.

<HEADLINE>  Military Jury Says To Dismiss Marine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A military jury on Friday recommended  
dismissal from the Marine Corps for a navigator who admitted 
destroying a personal videotape he made before his jet cut an 
Italian ski gondola cable, killing 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine-man panel of Marine officers deliberated 3 1/2 hours  
Friday before recommending the punishment for Capt. Joseph 
Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer sat stoically and the courtroom was silent as the  
judge, Col. Alvin Keller, imposed the recommended sentence. But 
after court adjourned, Schweitzer smiled at his lawyers and nodded 
his head. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer pleaded guilty Monday to obstruction of justice and  
conspiracy for destroying the tape after his EA-6B Prowler hit the 
cable over Cavalese, Italy, on Feb. 3, 1998. The ski gondola 
plunged 370 feet into a valley. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge had the option of sentencing Schweitzer to a  
previously undisclosed punishment recommended as part of 
Schweitzer's guilty plea, or to accept the jury's recommendation -- 
whichever is more lenient. 
</P>
<P>
	He chose the jury's recommendation. The sentence proposed in the  
plea agreement, divulged after the jury made its recommendation, 
called for forfeiture of pay and allowance and dismissal from the 
Marine Corps. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentence doesn't take effect until it is approved by Lt.  
Gen. Peter Pace, who convened the court-martial. Pace, commander of 
Marine Forces Atlantic in Norfolk, Va., may approve the sentence or 
recommend a lighter one. Schweitzer then could choose to pursue his 
decision through the military appeals process. 
</P>
<P>
	A prosecutor, Maj. Stu Couch, urged the jury earlier Friday to  
recommend Schweitzer's dismissal from the service and prison, but 
said the government didn't wish to see him sentenced to the maximum 
10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is this a character flaw or just a crime?'' Couch asked.  
``Everybody trusted him. ... That makes the perfect conspirator, 
somebody who has that amount of trust built up over a period of 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Dave Beck said the harshest punishment should  
be a letter of reprimand. 
</P>
<P>
	``Capt. Schweitzer has got to get up every day and know his  
career in the Marine Corps is over,'' Beck said. ``This good and 
faithful Marine, this outstanding Marine officer made some bad 
decisions over a three- to five-day period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beck reminded the jurors that Schweitzer ``looked you in the  
eye. ... He told you things that nobody had any way of knowing 
until he came forward to tell the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couch said the tape so worried Schweitzer and the pilot, Capt.  
Richard Ashby, that they stayed in the cockpit after making an 
emergency landing at the Aviano, Italy, air base to swap the tape 
for a blank one. Schweitzer said he later tossed the cassette into 
a bonfire. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's the one thing on his mind?'' Couch asked. ``That tape.  
That tape was stressing him out ... driving him nuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer testified Thursday that he stopped taping 10 minutes  
before the jet severed the cable, but said he smiled once into the 
camera and feared the image would be used in media reports of the 
tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	He described his destruction of the tape as the biggest mistake  
of his life and said he wanted to die after learning people in the 
gondola had been killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Involuntary manslaughter charges against Schweitzer were dropped  
after Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., was acquitted last month 
of the same charges. Ashby still faces the two obstruction charges 
and his trial is scheduled April 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Two back seat crewmen in the radar-jamming aircraft were charged  
after the accident, but the charges were dismissed last year.

	Schweitzer testified Thursday that he stopped taping 10 minutes  
before the jet severed the cable, but said he smiled once into the 
camera and feared the image would be used in media reports of the 
tragedy.

<P>
	He described his destruction of the tape as the biggest mistake  
of his life and said he wanted to die after learning people in the 
gondola had been killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Involuntary manslaughter charges against Schweitzer were dropped  
after Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., was acquitted last month 
of the same charges. Ashby still faces the two obstruction charges 
and his trial is scheduled April 27.

<HEADLINE> Marlins' Springer Wins Starting Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Fla. (AP) -- Journeyman knuckleballer Dennis Springer  
has to fight for a job every season, which may be why his hair is 
gray at 34. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Springer won a spot in the Florida Marlins' rotation  
only because they decided to begin the season with five starters 
instead of four. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a nice little release of pressure,'' said Springer, who  
went 3-11 with a 5.45 ERA for Tampa Bay last year. ``Every year 
it's been like this. I'm an insurance policy guy. I'm always the 
11th or 12th guy on a staff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Marlins decided to keep Springer because he can be used as a  
reliever between starts. For example, he'll be in the bullpen for 
the first two games of the season Monday and Tuesday, then make his 
first start Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-handed Springer and lefty Kurt Ojala give the Marlins  
two knuckleballers, a rarity on one staff. That could be an 
effective contrast to their three relievers who throw in the upper 
90s -- closer Matt Mantei, setup man Braden Looper and Antonio 
Alfonseca. 
</P>
<P>
	With off days, the five-man rotation means the Marlins' starters  
will get five days off between starts early in the season. Manager 
John Boles said the extra rest will benefit youngsters Livan 
Hernandez, Jesus Sanchez and Brian Meadows, as well as Alex 
Fernandez, who is coming back from rotator cuff surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think we have to provide some protection for our guys with  
cold weather early in the season,'' Boles said. ``And we have to 
watch Alex.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Marlins will begin the season with an 11-man pitching staff.  
Eight of the 11 were with the team last year, when Florida finished 
last in the National League in ERA and lost 108 games. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's reason to expect improvement from a young staff with  
nine pitchers in their 20s. The relief corps recently had a streak 
of 18 consecutive scoreless innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like the bullpen,'' Boles said. ``The bullpen has been our  
strength so far. If we pitch during the season like we did during 
spring training, we're going to be OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boles is encouraged by the starting rotation following the  
latest outings by Hernandez and Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel better about it than I did two weeks ago,'' he said.  
``We are going to have to pitch very well and play good defense, 
because we are not an offensive machine.''

<HEADLINE> Small Romanian Bank Sold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- General Electric Capital Corp. and the  
Portuguese Investment Bank signed a $43 million agreement Friday to 
buy a 45 percent stake of a Romanian state-owned bank. 
</P>
<P>
	General Electric Capital will take a 35 percent stake and Banco  
Portugues de Investimento will take 10 percent of BancPost, a small 
Romanian state bank that has not been plagued by bad loans, as some 
other banks have. 
</P>
<P>
	They also will invest $50 million over five years improving the  
bank's technology, developing new products and training staff. 
</P>
<P>
	After the deal, Romania's privatization agency, the State  
Ownership Fund, will be left with a 25 percent stake in the bank, 
with the remaining 30 percent owned by several Romanian investment 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	BancPost is the second Romanian bank to be privatized. In  
November, Societe Generale de France signed a $200 million deal to 
buy a majority stake in Romanian Bank for Development.

<HEADLINE> Reds' Casey Has High Hopes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. (AP) -- Sean Casey is hoping for a smoother  
second season. It almost has to be better than the first. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Casey was traded from the Cleveland Indians to the  
Cincinnati Reds, was handed the Reds' starting first base job and 
had the bone below his right eye shattered by a thrown ball. 
</P>
<P>
	That was all in the first week of the season.  
</P>
<P>
	He had surgery, got his vision back, did some rehabilitation in  
the minors, got called up, struggled, was sent back down, got his 
swing together, came up and turned into the hitter the Reds 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't end there. He got engaged to a special education  
teacher, went back to school in the offseason and obtained his 
undergraduate degree in speech communication. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sat down this winter and thought about what went on last  
year,'' Casey said. ``It was no doubt a roller coaster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it ended on an upswing, and that's what Casey thought about  
the most. After the scare with his eye and an unsuccessful return 
to the majors soon after the injury, the 24-year-old first baseman 
showed why he was considered one of the Indians' top hitting 
prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey batted .316 in July and .305 in August, eliminating any  
concerns about his eye. He also established himself as the Reds' 
first baseman of the future. They traded first baseman Paul Konerko 
after the season, leaving the job to Casey. 
</P>
<P>
	That frenetic, frightful, frustrating rookie season ended up  
being pretty good after all. Casey hit .272 in 96 games with 21 
doubles, seven homers and 52 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
	``It turned out to be a good year,'' he said. ``You look at my  
numbers compared to all the rookies in the league and I think I was 
up there in the top 10 in most categories. And most of my numbers 
were second-half numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have liked to have seen what I could have done for a  
full year, but obviously the circumstances didn't happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His circumstances are much improved heading into his second  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no lingering concerns about his eye. When he was hit  
by a throw during infield practice one year ago Friday, he 
temporarily lost vision in the right eye. It took 20 stitches to 
close a gash around the eye and doctors installed a plate with five 
screws below it to stabilize the fractured bone. 
</P>
<P>
	There was concern that he might never get full vision back. One  
year later, his vision has improved. He no longer has to wear a 
contact lens in the right eye. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no much uncertainty when I got hit. Would I play  
again? How would I come back? Would I be the same player?'' Casey 
said. ``In fact, the vision came back to normal in that eye. It 
corrected itself. I think it's kind of a blessing the way things 
worked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Casey was one of the Reds' most consistent hitters this spring,  
batting .343 with two homers and 13 RBIs -- second on the club -- 
after 22 games. He also began taking on a bigger role in the 
clubhouse as he became the team's assistant union representative. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a chance to have a role outside of baseball to help  
this team, which is good,'' he said. ``Hopefully as I play this 
game more and more, I'll have a chance to be a leader.''

<HEADLINE> Scientists Tackle 'Peeps' Riddle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The question baffled two Emory University  
researchers: What are Peeps -- those marshmallow birds that appear 
in stores around Easter -- anyway? 
</P>
<P>
	On a sugar buzz after devouring ice cream sundaes with one too  
many Peeps on top, Gary Falcon and Jim Zimring set out to explain 
the colorful, spongy creatures. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were really just wondering what Peeps were after eating a  
dozen or two and so we immediately went to the kitchen and started 
trying to boil them,'' said Falcon, a computer administrator at the 
Atlanta school. 
</P>
<P>
	Falcon and Zimring, a medical student, were astounded that Peeps  
didn't dissolve in water. In fact, the only liquid they could 
dissolve the candy in was phenol, a chemical used for dissolving 
proteins. 
</P>
<P>
	Their conclusion: Peeps aren't mostly sugar after all. They are  
made of gelatin, sugar and corn syrup. 
</P>
<P>
	After that discovery, the researchers decided Peeps deserved a  
more rigorous examination. 
</P>
<P>
	They tested the birds' reaction to cold by submerging them in  
liquid nitrogen. The result: They froze. They tested Peeps' 
reaction to low-pressure environments by putting them in a vacuum. 
The result: They shriveled up. 
</P>
<P>
	And because the candy is often found in party environments, they  
tested Peeps' reaction to alcohol and cigarettes. When a Peep was 
floated in rubbing alcohol with a lit cigarette in its mouth, it 
ended up as a ball of charred goo. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was featured on CNN last year after the researchers  
began conducting their sugar-induced studies. They planned new 
research over the winter and have been busy since Peeps arrived in 
stores in mid-February. 
</P>
<P>
	In a new study for 1999, Falcon and Zimring surgically separated  
a group of Peeps, which are ``born'' as conjoined quintuplets. 
</P>
<P>
	Falcon and Zimring's next goal, inspired by John Glenn's return  
to space, is to study the effects of space travel and aging on the 
Peep population. They wouldn't say how they plan to get the birds 
into space. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers, both 29, didn't receive any grant money for  
their tests, but were careful to use scientific methods. 
</P>
<P>
	``The results might be absolutely useless, but it is science  
more or less,'' Falcon said. 
</P>
<P>
	They used an Emory lab, which was OK with the school. ``We've  
watched this with amusement,'' spokeswoman Nancy Seideman said. 
</P>
<P>
	So has Just Born, the Bethlehem, Pa., company that makes Peeps.  
``We make candy,'' said spokeswoman Rose Craig, ``and candy is 
supposed to be fun.''

<HEADLINE> BMW, Hyundai Sell More Cars in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- BMW and Hyundai Motor Co. posted significant  
sales gains in the United States last month, while Mazda Motor 
Corp. sustained a double-digit decline in an otherwise robust 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	The sales figures released Friday followed strong reports a day  
earlier by DaimlerChrysler AG, Toyota Motor Corp., Honda Motor Co. 
and several other major automakers. The industry's torrid 
performance in March and the first quarter is another sign of the 
strength of the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., which together command  
53 percent of the U.S. market, plan to report their March figures 
next week. The 17 automakers who had reported sales figures by 
Friday were up 14 percent combined for the first quarter and 12 
percent in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's BMW had its best month in the United States ever, with  
sales up 14 percent over a year ago. The increase was driven by 
strong demand for the redesigned 3-series sedans. For the quarter, 
BMW's sales were up 16 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Korean carmaker Hyundai increased its sales 18 percent over  
March 1997, based on the daily sales rate. The Elantra compact 
sedan was the strongest performer, with sales up 74 percent. 
Hyundai posted a 13 percent improvement for the first three months 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Mazda was one of the few exceptions to the March and  
first-quarter sales trend. 
</P>
<P>
	Its sales were down 21.5 percent for the month, capping a first  
quarter that was down nearly 11 percent. While sales of Mazda's 
Millenia luxury sedan were up by 24.5 percent and B-series pickup 
sales improved 20 percent, demand for Mazda's other models was down 
sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason for the decline was the MPV minivan went out of  
production in December and stocks have declined, spokesman Brian 
Betz said. A redesigned MPV was unveiled this week at the New York 
International Auto Show and will begin arriving in showrooms in 
July.

<HEADLINE> NYC DiMaggio Monument in the Works </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WOBURN, Mass. (AP) -- A Massachusetts sculptor has landed a  
contract to memorialize Joe DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Shure of Burlington was asked to complete a bronze relief of  
DiMaggio. The bronze bust will be placed in Yankee Stadium 
alongside other memorials to baseball greats, including Babe Ruth 
and Lou Gehrig. 
</P>
<P>
	``To say I was thrilled was an underestimation,'' Shure told the  
Daily Times Chronicle of Woburn after being selected to do the 
portrait of DiMaggio, who died March 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Shure has made a clay mold of the portrait, which was presented  
to Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. The next step in the design 
will be a plaster model, then the bronze bust itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Shure previously made reliefs of Boston slugger Ted Williams for  
the tunnel named after him and another for pitcher Cy Young on 
Huntington Avenue in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Shire, whose studio is in Woburn, also worked on the Irish  
Famine Memorial on the Freedom Trail in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The dedication of the DiMaggio relief is slated for April 25.  
DiMaggio's family is scheduled to be there, as are Steinbrenner and 
Shure. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio, who died last month at 84, was immortalized in song  
and literature, a man respected as much for his dignity as for his 
accomplishments during 13 seasons with the Yankees. His 56-game 
hitting streak in 1941, one of the greatest feats in all sports, is 
still a record. 
</P>
<P>
	The wording on the relief for DiMaggio will read: Joseph Paul  
DiMaggio, ``The Yankee Clipper,'' 1914-1999. Recognized as 
Baseball's ``Greatest Living Player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The relief will also show DiMaggio's lifetime batting average of  
.325 and note that he won the Most Valuable Player awards in 1939, 
1941 and 1947. 
</P>
<P>
	It will also pay tribute to DiMaggio's other achievements,  
including his selection to the All-Star game 13 times and his 
American League batting titles in 1939 and 1940.

<HEADLINE> Tourney's 2nd Round Snowed Out  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- An intense spring storm that tormented  
competitors during the opening round of The Tradition with sheets 
of rain turned colder Friday and snowed out the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	The cancellation set up the second 54-hole tournament in the  
11-year history of the Senior PGA Tour major. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham Marsh and Howard Twitty, who opened at 3-under-par 69 on  
Thursday, will have a one-stroke lead on Leonard Thompson, Vicente 
Fernandez and Mike McCullough when play resumes Saturday morning. 
Tee times will be later and players will use the front and back 
nines in an attempt to find better weather. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 4 inches accumulated over five hours of flurries on  
the scenic Cochise Course at Desert Mountain, where the 3,200-foot 
elevation froze the storm's heavy moisture into snow. 
</P>
<P>
	Before it melted, the blanket of white lent a Christmas-card  
look to the saguaro cactus and other plants that separate the 
fairways and greens of the desert course. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was supposed to play late, so I was just driving up and I  
saw the snow mixed with rain,'' 1993 champion Tom Shaw said. ``I 
thought, `Isn't this nice?' Then I went farther and it was on the 
ground, and I wondered how thick it would get. I saw some cars 
going the other way, and my first reaction was to turn around and 
go back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said outlandish weather is part of the game.  
</P>
<P>
	``The year before I started playing the regular tour (1963), it  
snowed the Crosby out,'' Shaw said. ``Somebody went down to rake 
`Crosby Clambake' in the snow, and it was on the cover of the 
program next year. I've played in snow in Pensacola in late 
February, but it didn't stick. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I remember one year at the British Open at St. Andrews, I  
had on everything I owned and I was freezing to death. I was so 
thankful that they had 7-foot-long bathtubs -- I just filled the 
thing up with hot water and pretended I was a submarine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Jack Nicklaus won the first of his four Tradition titles in  
1990, the first round wasn't played until Friday because of hail 
and rain that forced two suspensions the day before. In better 
weather, Bruce Crampton, Mike Hill, Phil Rodgers and Al Geiberger 
shot 69s to share the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus started with a 71 but had a 67-68 finish to beat Gary  
Player by four strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	John Morgan, John Bland, Dana Quigley, George Archer and Dale  
Douglass, at 71, were the only others below par this year, a record 
for high scoring in the first round. Fifteen players broke par in 
1989, the inaugural year. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, 15 shot 80 or worse.  
</P>
<P>
	Shaw, who never scored higher than 69 when he won six years ago,  
was among them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fort Lauderdale, Fla., resident took the day off after the  
cancellation, thought about a movie and then went shopping to 
forget his 80, which could prove costly because of the shortened 
format. 
</P>
<P>
	``It kind of locks everybody in the positions where they  
started,'' Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglass, who has homes in Colorado and Arizona, said cold  
weather affects senior players more than others. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tighter you get, the shorter your swing gets,'' he said.  
``You can't hit it as far, and you probably can't hit it as 
straight. You just have to stay warm and give yourself a good 
chance of making a swing.''

<HEADLINE>  Russia Warship To Shadow NATO Ships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- A Russian warship left for the Mediterranean today  
to shadow NATO vessels participating in airstrikes against 
Yugoslavia as Moscow continued to insist that the attacks must end. 
</P>
<P>
	The frigate left from the Black Sea fleet's base at Sevastopol  
and was expected to pass through the Bosporus Strait and into the 
Mediterranean on Saturday. Six other warships were on standby for 
deployment in the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has said it will not become involved in the military  
conflict despite its close ties with Yugoslavia. NATO and the 
United States are unhappy about the Russian naval deployment. 
</P>
<P>
	Deploying Russian ships near NATO warships in action against  
Yugoslavia has raised concerns about an accidental confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials reviewed the Kosovo situation today and said  
they would continue efforts to find a political solution. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin called Thursday for a meeting of the foreign ministers  
of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations and Russia on 
halting the NATO attacks. But with all the G-7 nations except Japan 
taking part in the assault, it appeared unlikely they would agree 
to such a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey, a NATO member that controls the Bosporus -- through which  
Russian ships must pass from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean -- 
said it approved Russian requests to send eight warships through. 
</P>
<P>
	Four ships could pass through the strait this weekend, three  
more on Tuesday and one on April 8. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kremlin has walked a thin line between solidarity with its  
Yugoslav ally and confrontation with the West, trying to ignore 
domestic opponents who have accused the government of weakness. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia does not have the means to do more than protest. The  
Russian military is disintegrating and Moscow needs Western loans

<HEADLINE>  Russia Warship To Shadow NATO Ships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- A Russian warship left for the Mediterranean today  
to shadow NATO vessels participating in airstrikes against 
Yugoslavia as Moscow continued to insist that the attacks must end. 
</P>
<P>
	The frigate left from the Black Sea fleet's base at Sevastopol  
and was expected to pass through the Bosporus Strait and into the 
Mediterranean on Saturday. Six other warships were on standby for 
deployment in the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has said it will not become involved in the military  
conflict despite its close ties with Yugoslavia. NATO and the 
United States are unhappy about the Russian naval deployment. 
</P>
<P>
	Deploying Russian ships near NATO warships in action against  
Yugoslavia has raised concerns about an accidental confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials reviewed the Kosovo situation today and said  
they would continue efforts to find a political solution. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin called Thursday for a meeting of the foreign ministers  
of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations and Russia on 
halting the NATO attacks. But with all the G-7 nations except Japan 
taking part in the assault, it appeared unlikely they would agree 
to such a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey, a NATO member that controls the Bosporus -- through which  
Russian ships must pass from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean -- 
said it approved Russian requests to send eight warships through. 
</P>
<P>
	Four ships could pass through the strait this weekend, three  
more on Tuesday and one on April 8. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kremlin has walked a thin line between solidarity with its  
Yugoslav ally and confrontation with the West, trying to ignore 
domestic opponents who have accused the government of weakness. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia does not have the means to do more than protest. The  
Russian military is disintegrating and Moscow needs Western loans 
to prop up the plunging economy.

<HEADLINE> 'Jenny Jones' Case Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- A sociologist said she told  
representatives of ``The Jenny Jones Show'' that having guests 
reveal intimate secrets could lead to violence -- and her warning 
was laughed at. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was a superficial, callous response to what they  
were doing with these people,'' Maryaltani Karpos, a University of 
Miami professor of criminology and sociology, testified Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Karpos said she gave the unsolicited warning a year before a  
gay guest was slain after admitting on the show that he had a crush 
on a heterosexual acquaintance. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Amedure's family has filed a $50 million wrongful death  
lawsuit naming the show, its distributor and producer. The lawsuit 
contends the show's ``ambush'' tactics humiliated Jonathan Schmitz 
and drove him to shoot Amedure in March 1995, three days after they 
appeared on the program. The episode never aired. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz was invited on the show to meet a secret admirer only to  
discover it was Amedure. He was convicted of Amedure's murder, but 
the verdict was overturned due to an error in jury selection. His 
retrial is pending. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial was in recess until Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Karpos said she spoke to the representatives by phone after  
recoiling at a ``Jenny Jones'' episode. She said she believes 
exposing secrets on camera can lead to an increased potential for 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``These emotions, once they are called for, don't just dissipate  
once you turn off the camera,'' she testified. ``There's some 
danger inherent in the period of time that follows the show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When questioned by defense lawyer James Feeney, Ms. Karpos  
acknowledged she had never done investigative work or primary 
research in relation to televised talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
	In other testimony, a former emergency dispatcher said that  
Schmitz was sobbing and repeatedly mentioned ``The Jenny Jones 
Show'' when he called 911 just moments after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``It broke my heart to hear him,'' said Mary Jones, a former  
Auburn Hills police dispatcher. ``What stood out was he was upset. 
Jenny Jones, national television -- those were the things that kept 
coming up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones, who is not being sued, is expected to testify  
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Matadors Part-Owner Sues Partners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Robert Alterman, a minority owner of the Miami  
Matadors minor league hockey team, filed suit Friday against two of 
his partners for fraud, saying he was misled about how much the 
partners had invested in the club. 
</P>
<P>
	Alterman is seeking to recover his $500,000 investment in the  
team and an injunction keeping the team from being sold until the 
ownership dispute is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the best scenario for him to get value out of the money he  
invested would be to take control of the team, that would be a 
scenario he would consider,'' said Alvin Lodish, Alterman's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Alterman is one of four people recruited by team president Bob  
Snyder and Robert Davis to bring the East Coast Hockey League team 
from Louisville, Ky., to South Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the suit, Alterman agreed to join the purchasing  
group last November after being told by Snyder that they had 
combined to invest $875,000 in the partnership. He was given a 20 
percent stake in the team. 
</P>
<P>
	A subsequent review by Alterman's accountant found that Snyder  
and Davis had contributed just $130,000 in cash to the project, 
with much of the rest attributed to ``sweat equity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alterman also accused the partnership of violating its own  
agreement by negotiating to sell the team without his consent. The 
agreement states the team shall not be sold without the consent of 
more than 80 percent of the limited partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder has acknowledged that he is talking with a buyer who  
wants to move the team out of South Florida. An agreement could 
come within the next couple of months, he said, adding that the 
team likely would take next season off before playing in a new 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder called Alterman's lawsuit ``just an internal matter that  
we'll settle. Any conversations will remain internal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Matadors have struggled at the gate, ranking last in the  
27-team ECHL with an average of just 1,383 per game. Two games were 
moved out of Miami Arena to local ice rinks in an effort to save 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami failed to make the playoffs, meaning Friday night's game  
against Jacksonville likely was the team's final appearance in 
South Florida.

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Pursue Steel Complaints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Commerce Department will pursue the U.S.  
steel industry's trade complaints against six countries accused of 
illegally pricing cut-to-length steel plates. 
</P>
<P>
	The inquiry was triggered by a U.S. International Trade  
Commission vote Friday finding evidence that imports from France, 
India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan and South Korea have hurt domestic 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases are part of a second round of complaints filed by  
major producers that have been struggling against a recent surge in 
steel imports. In the first round, the government is considering 
tariffs on hot-rolled carbon steel from Japan and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's vote represents another step by the U.S. steel  
industry and its workers to pursue aggressively all available 
courses of action,'' said Paul Wilheim, president of U.S. Steel 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was only a partial one, however. The trade  
commission, an independent fact-finding agency, voted to drop cases 
against the Czech Republic and Macedonia after finding their 
shipments of cut-to-length plates to be negligible -- less than 3 
percent of overall imports to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic steel producers and steelworkers have blamed the  
imports for thousands of layoffs and three U.S. company 
bankruptcies. 
</P>
<P>
	Although imports have since dropped, steel producers continue to  
press the administration and Congress for help. 
</P>
<P>
	The imports reached record highs last year as the Asian economic  
crisis reduced demand for steel abroad and forced foreign producers 
to turn to U.S. markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, five steel producers and the United Steelworkers of  
America accused the eight countries of illegally dumping 
cut-to-length steel in the United States at prices below production 
costs or home-market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	They also accused France, India, Indonesia, Italy, Macedonia and  
South Korea of unfairly subsidizing their producers to artificially 
lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
	A Japanese steel executive, Fujio Ono, has called the cases  
unjustified, saying market forces and not artificial trade 
practices were responsible for the import surge. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department has until mid-May to issue a preliminary  
finding on subsidies and until late July to initially rule on 
dumping. 
</P>
<P>
	Cut-to-length plate, thicker than the widely used hot-rolled  
variety, is used in agricultural and construction equipment, 
bridges, ships, railcars and buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	In the hot-rolled cases, the Commerce Department has issued  
preliminary dumping findings against Japan, Russia and Brazil. 
Final rulings are expected by summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan and Brazil face tariffs of up to 71 percent if the  
findings are affirmed and found to threaten U.S. industry. Russia 
has reached a deal with the United States to avoid tariffs by 
voluntarily curtailing shipments.

	U.S. Appeals Internet Porn Ruling  
</P>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Justice Department appealed a judge's  
ruling that blocked enforcement of a federal Internet pornography 
law. Government lawyers had until today to decide whether to appeal 
U.S. District Judge Lowell A. Reed's Feb. 1 preliminary injunction 
barring enforcement of the Child Online Protection Act. The law, 
signed into law by President Clinton last year, would require 
commercial Web sites to collect a credit card number or some other 
access code as proof of age before allowing Internet users to view 
online material deemed ``harmful to minors.''

	Unemployment Hits 29-Year Low  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's unemployment rate fell to a  
29-year low of 4.2 percent in March, with Hispanics and high school 
dropouts among the groups registering the most dramatic 
improvement. ``This is a historic report,'' Labor Secretary Alexis 
Herman said. ``It's an indication this is an economy that is 
lifting all boats.'' The rate for Hispanics fell from 6.7 percent 
to 5.8 percent, the lowest since the Labor Department began 
calculating a rate for the group in 1973. The improvement in the 
rate, from 4.4 percent in February, came despite the smallest 
seasonally adjusted increase in three years in the number of jobs -- 
46,000. That's the fewest since an outright decline in payrolls in 
January 1996 when a blizzard struck the Northeast. Economists 
attributed much of the latest deceleration in job growth to the 
weather rather rather than to any significant deterioration in the 
economy.

disrupted e-mail communications worldwide. The New Jersey state 
attorney general's office announced that David L. Smith, 30, of 
Aberdeen, was arrested last night, and that the virus originated 
from his home. It also said Smith faces various charges, including 
interruption of public communications. Attorney General Peter 
Verniero said that altogether, the charges carry a maximum penalty 
of 40 years in prison and a $480,000 fine. Smith was released on 
$100,000 bail and was scheduled to appear in state Superior Court 
in Monmouth County on Monday for arraignment.

<HEADLINE>  Baffert Tries for Another 1-2 Finish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Because Aaron Jones listened to Bob  
Baffert, he has his first Santa Anita Derby starter and a possible 
serious Kentucky Derby contender in Prime Timber. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Baffert didn't listen to his 12-year-old son, Tyler, he  
is the trainer, but not the owner, of Prime Timber, who will try to 
give Baffert his second straight Santa Anita Derby victory, then 
try for an unprecedented third consecutive win for Baffert in the 
Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Baffert recalled a telephone conversation with Jones  
that led to Florida-bred Prime Timber being bought for $375,000 as 
a 2-year-old at the 1998 Ocala Sale. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Jones, we've got to buy this thing,'' Baffert said. ``He's  
unbelievable. He reminds me of Silver Charm (second in the Santa 
Anita Derby and winner of the Kentucky Derby in 1997).'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 77-year-old Jones, in the lumber business in Oregon and a  
racehorse owner for nearly 30 years, admitted Friday that he was 
reluctant at first. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has no pedigree,'' Jones told Baffert. The colt is by  
Sultry Song out of the Nodouble mare Wine Taster. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's OK, he can run,'' Baffert replied.  
</P>
<P>
	After Baffert hung up with Jones, his son, who had been  
listening, said, ``Why are you buying it for him, buy it for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Timber, ridden by David Flores, probably will be the  
post-time favorite for the 1 1/8-mile Santa Anita Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	In his last start, the colt, wearing blinkers for the first  
time, won the 1 1-16-mile San Felipe March 13. That was his first 
win in two starts as a 3-year-old and his third victory in five 
career races. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his two seconds came in his 3-year-old debut when, racing  
wide throughout, he was runner-up by a neck to Santa Anita Derby 
contender Desert Hero in the one-mile San Rafael Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert will not only be seeking his third Santa Anita Derby  
victory -- his first was in 1996 with Cavonnier, the Kentucky Derby 
runner-up -- he also will be trying for a second straight 1-2 
finish. He got that last year with Indian Charlie and Real Quiet. 
The latter won the Kentucky Derby, with Indian Charlie third. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert's other Santa Anita Derby starter and Kentucky Derby  
hopeful is General Challenge, a California-bred gelding, ridden by 
Gary Stevens and owned by John and Betty Mabee. 
</P>
<P>
	General Challenge, who won his only two starts last year and  
also his 3-year-old debut, finished fifth in his last start, the 1 
1-16-mile Louisiana Derby March 14. He will race with blinkers for 
the first time Saturday. He wore them for the first time when he 
worked five-eighths of a mile in 57 3-5 seconds March 23 at Santa 
Anita. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel as confident going into this race as I did last year,  
and it's a tougher race this year,'' Baffert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the opposition that his pair will face, Baffert noted Desert  
Hero and the filly Honest Lady. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the field for the $750,000 race are Capsized, Hire Wire  
Act, Charismatic and Walk That Walk. 
</P>
<P>
	Desert Hero, a son of 1993 Kentucky Derby winner Sea Hero, is  
ridden by Corey Nakatani and owned by Prince Ahmed bin Salman of 
Saudi Arabia. He did not race as a 2-year-old, making his debut 
with a victory Feb. 7 at Santa Anita, then winning the San Rafael. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Desert Hero wins this race, he's a super horse,'' Baffert  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Honest Lady, Baffert said, ``Bobby Frankel wouldn't let  
her in if he didn't think she had a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Frankel said Honest Lady has to win Saturday to earn a  
shot at the Kentucky Derby or if she doesn't win, ``I would think 
she would have to have a big excuse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Honest Lady, ridden by Kent Desormeaux and owned by Prince  
Khalid Abdullah, also of Saudi Arabia, won her first two starts, 
then made her debut against colts in the San Rafael. She finished 
fifth, but only one length behind winner Desert Hero. 
</P>
<P>
	Honest Lady will carry 115 pounds to 120 for each of the other  
starters. Three fillies have won the race -- Ciencia (1939), Silver 
Spoon (1959) and Winning Colors (1988). Winning Colors also was the 
third, and last, filly to win the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Capsized, third in the San Rafael, is trained by Lisa Lewis,  
only the fifth woman to saddle a horse for the Santa Anita Derby. 
None has won.

<HEADLINE>  'Melissa' Virus Suspect Nabbed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A man has been arrested and charged with  
originating the e-mail virus known as Melissa, which swamped 
computers around the world, spreading like a malicious chain 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
	David L. Smith, who was arrested Thursday night, named the virus  
after a topless dancer from Florida, where he used to live, the New 
Jersey attorney general's office said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 30, of Aberdeen was arrested at his brother's house in  
nearby Eatontown, said Rita Malley, a spokeswoman for Attorney 
General Peter Verniero. Smith created the virus from his apartment, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	He faces several charges, including interruption of public  
communications, conspiracy to commit the offense, attempt to commit 
the offense, and third-degree theft of computer service. All 
together, the charges carry a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison 
and a $480,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he is tried and successfully convicted, he will do hard  
time.'' Verniero said at an afternoon news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Verniero said Smith was a network programmer for a company that  
did subcontracting for AT&AMP;T Corp. The company's name was not 
immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was tracked down with the help of America Online  
technicians, and a computer task force composed of federal and 
state agents, Malley said. Authorities would not elaborate on the 
methods used to trace the virus, saying the investigation was 
ongoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Melissa appeared last Friday and spread rapidly around the world  
by Monday, swamping the e-mail systems of thousands of computers -- 
including those at government agencies. The virus caused infected 
computers to fire off dozens of messages to friends and colleagues, 
temporarily clogging e-mail systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, experts had said there were clues that  
Melissa's author had distributed the virus using an account stolen 
from America Online 15 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Several antivirus software makers, including McAfee, Symantec,  
Trend Micro and Sophos, posted patches on their Web sites that 
detect and reject the Melissa virus.

	Several computer experts earlier this week said they had found  
clues linking the virus to a writer who uses the computer handle 
``VicodinES.'' Malley said Smith was ``definitely not'' the person 
who used that handle, but also said investigators believe he took 
two viruses, one of which came from VicodinES, and combined them 
with another virus to create Melissa. 
</P>
<P>
	VicodinES, which also happens to be the name of narcotic pain  
killer, is well know to a group of virus writers who gather online 
on what's known as The Virus Exchange Underground.

	No one answered the door at Smith's second-floor apartment in  
the Ken Gardens complex in Aberdeen today. The blinds were drawn to 
his windows and on a sliding glass door to a small balcony.

<HEADLINE> Marinovich Set For NFL Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVINE, Calif. (AP) -- Todd Marinovich, a 1991 first-round NFL  
draft pick with a troubled history, was cleared Friday by the 
league to pursue a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very excited,'' said Leonard Shulman, Marinovich's  
lawyer. ``He has been working towards this for the past six 
months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marinovich, 29, has not played in the NFL since 1992. He was cut  
by the Los Angeles Raiders at the end of the 1993 training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	After nearly a year off, the former Southern Cal quarterback  
resurfaced in 1994 to play in the CFL. He lasted three weeks before 
a serious knee injury required surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Marinovich was sentenced to six months in jail in 1997 after  
pleading guilty to a felony charge of cultivating marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Marinovich was not technically suspended, Shulman said,  
the league established guidelines for his return, including 
enrolling in a rehabilitation program, counseling and intermittent 
drug testing, Shulman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were successful in demonstrating that through his probation  
(from the 1997 drug conviction) he was being tested regularly, and 
for the last 18 months he had been clean,'' Shulman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the league didn't specify terms for Marinovich's  
reinstatement, Shulman said he expected monthly, unscheduled drug 
testing to continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We support that and Todd supports this also,'' the lawyer  
said. ``We were not asking for reinstatement without condition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shulman said Marinovich threw during a recent workout with USC's  
seniors that was attended by several NFL scouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least six teams talked to us directly about their  
interest,'' Shulman said.

<HEADLINE> Mystery Surrounds Louis Farrakhan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Is Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of  
Islam, ``recuperating nicely'' from prostate cancer, as Jesse 
Jackson put it? Is he alert and looking forward to going home from 
Howard University Hospital? Or is he, as a Chicago associate says, 
seriously ill? 
</P>
<P>
	A tightlipped hospital staff, conflicting medical reports and  
the Nation of Islam's customary secrecy on its internal affairs are 
combining to raise more questions than to provide answers about the 
health of the 65-year-old Farrakhan, who is recovering from surgery 
he underwent on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan, who has won both worldwide praise and scorn during  
his 20 controversial years at the helm of the Nation of Islam, was 
flown from his Illinois home to the hospital here Tuesday night for 
the emergency surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan, organizer of the nation's largest black gathering in  
history, the Million Man March on Washington in 1995, remained in 
the hospital on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But little beyond that is certain.  
</P>
<P>
	Other than confirming Farrakhan is a patient, the hospital won't  
release information on his condition. And security is so tight on 
his hospital floor that even doctors who aren't working on his case 
are being asked to stay away, said a hospital source. 
</P>
<P>
	The day after the surgery, the Nation of Islam released a  
statement that Farrakhan was stable, resting and that his prognosis 
was excellent. Civil rights leader Jackson issued his own statement 
saying he visited with Farrakhan who was ``recuperating nicely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a report published in The Washington Post on Friday quoted a  
hospital source as saying Farrakhan was more seriously ill than 
Nation of Islam officials were letting on. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard F. Muhammad, Farrakhan's son-in-law and chief of staff,  
called the Post report totally inaccurate and said Farrakhan is 
alert and looked forward to leaving the hospital shortly. 
</P>
<P>
	``His spirits are good. He would like to see visitors but the  
doctors have recommended against that for now,'' Muhammad said. 
``He is very stable and his condition has only improved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The conflicting reports have some Nation of Islam members and  
supporters deeply concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 black ministers in Chicago, Farrakhan's home city,  
are organizing a multi-church prayer service on Easter. A Nation of 
Islam source in Chicago said he heard that prayer services were 
being scheduled in at least seven other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are concerned for him because the situation is serious,''  
said a Chicago source, requesting anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Muslim leader is beloved by many in the black community as  
an uncompromising voice in the fight for black empowerment. At the 
same time, Farrakhan has also drawn the contempt of many for 
statements against whites, Jews and gays. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan's fiery rhetoric has singed not only his opponents but  
also some who have attempted to move closer to him politically. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Kweisi Mfume, then chairman of the Congressional Black  
Caucus, announced the group had formed a ``sacred covenant'' with 
Farrakhan and civil rights groups to develop strategies to combat 
inner-city crime and violence. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mfume was forced to back away when some caucus members said  
they weren't apprised of any arrangement with the Nation of Islam 
and disapproved of some of Farrakhan's language. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe Minister Farrakhan is perhaps the most authentic  
voice for the black disaffected in America,'' said Arthur Magida, 
author of Prophet of Rage, a Farrakhan biography published in 1996. 
``But what detracts from his legacy is his tendency to portray 
blacks as victims of themselves, of whites and of Jewish America.''

<HEADLINE>  Harrick Shenanigans Miff R.I. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH KINGSTOWN, R.I. (AP) -- Rhode Island was all ready to  
trumpet the return of Jim Harrick -- to celebrate his decision not 
to take the basketball coaching job at Georgia after all. 
</P>
<P>
	But with a last-minute phone call, Harrick disappointed Rhode  
Island for the second time in as many days. 
</P>
<P>
	University officials appeared miffed by Harrick's flip-flop.  
</P>
<P>
	Harrick said Wednesday he was taking the job at Georgia, told  
Rhode Island officials that night he had changed his mind, and 24 
hours later said he was going to Georgia after all. 
</P>
<P>
	``We consider this to be an unfortunate turn of events,'' said  
Bob Beagle, a university vice president. ``We have acted in good 
faith throughout this entire process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beagle spoke during a news conference at which Harrick was  
supposed to announce he had decided to remain with Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick didn't show up for the press conference. He also didn't  
show up for a meeting he had arranged with his team to tell them he 
was coming back. 
</P>
<P>
	``The job felt right, but about my family, I was concerned,''  
Harrick said Thursday night in an interview with WJAR television in 
Cranston, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if he might change his mind again, he said, ``It's  
done. There is no more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Ron Petro had a sharp response to Harrick's  
about-face. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very concerned about his ability to make a decision,''  
Petro said during the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Petro said he had gotten a call from Harrick at about 6 p.m.  
Wednesday saying he had changed his mind about the Georgia job. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Petro, Harrick said during that phone call he had  
decided to return to Rhode Island ``because the people in Rhode 
Island had been very good to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Petro was glad to hear the news.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were disappointed with his decision to leave URI and  
obviously we would welcome him back,'' Beagle said. 
</P>
<P>
	At 4 p.m Thursday, Petro met Harrick and his wife at the  
Warwick, R.I. Petro said he asked Harrick and his wife if they 
remain committed to their decision to return to Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said `yes.' His wife was there with him and she said  
`yes,''' Petro said. 
</P>
<P>
	After failing to attend the players' meeting, Harrick talked  
with Petro by phone at about 6:10 p.m. Thursday to say he had again 
changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he was struggling with the decision, but that he has  
decided to go back to Georgia,'' Petro said. 
</P>
<P>
	Petro said Harrick didn't give him a clear reason for his latest  
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was hard getting it out of him,'' Petro said.  
</P>
<P>
	The first public sign of Petro's predicament emerged when the  
press conference failed to start at 7 p.m. as scheduled, and 
Harrick was nowhere to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
	Petro and Beagle shuttled anxiously between back offices in the  
university sports complex. 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 team boosters, mainly alumni, were also at the press  
conference and chatted happily about Harrick's expected return. 
</P>
<P>
	Told reporters were getting anxious, Petro pointedly replied:  
``How do you think we feel?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors of the bad news had already started to spread among the  
alumni before Petro and Beagle made their official statement, which 
elicited a collective gasp in the room. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, said Petro, life goes on.  
</P>
<P>
	``We'll gather ourselves tomorrow and get started again'' in the  
search for a coach, Petro said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Harrick's former players, guard Preston Murphy, said he  
had never believed Harrick would ultimately turn down Georgia's 
offer of up to $650,000 per year, nearly double the $350,000 he was 
earning at Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all that type of money, it's hard to say no,'' Murphy  
said.

<HEADLINE> Escrows for Internet Auctions? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Several months ago, Bart Moccabee shelled out  
$560 for some computer hardware sold on an Internet auction, then 
eagerly awaited the merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	He waited, and waited some more -- hoping to use the  
microprocessor and memory boards he successfully bid on to build a 
personal computer -- but he never heard from the seller again. When 
he tried to e-mail that individual to track down his purchase, he 
found the address inactive. 
</P>
<P>
	He got stung.  
</P>
<P>
	Yet Moccabee, a 27-year-old technical support supervisor from  
Hilliard, Ohio, wasn't out a cent. Because the order was so big, he 
decided beforehand to place his payment with an online escrow 
service. The service, i-Escrow, which processes transactions on the 
eBay auction site, cheerfully refunded his money, along with a 5 
percent service fee he paid. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many other people got ripped off by this guy,'' said Moccabee,  
a frequent Internet shopper. ``If I buy anything else big, I'm 
going to use this (escrow service) again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Online sales between strangers require a considerable amount of  
trust, and lots of things can go wrong. As more people use the 
Internet to buy and sell everything from Beanie Babies to beach 
bungalows -- millions of online transactions take place each month -- 
an increasing number are turning to escrow services to facilitate 
the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For a fee, which varies according to purchase price, an escrow  
holder essentially acts as a middleman to ensure buyers put up 
their money and sellers deliver the goods as promised. Typically, 
money is placed in a bank escrow account until the buyers receive 
and inspect their purchases and approve the release of funds to the 
seller. The buyer and seller can negotiate who pays the escrow fee. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, in a worst-case scenario, you could end up with a  
game of chicken: The buyer wants to see the item before paying; the 
seller won't part with it until he's paid. So, now what? 
</P>
<P>
	``We're selling trust,'' said Ken Pereira, chief executive  
officer of 4-year-old TradeSafe Online Corp., in Providence, R.I. 
(http://www.tradesafe.com), one of the first Internet escrow services to 
be founded. 
</P>
<P>
	``People come to us after essentially enacting transactions.  
They don't want to put a $5,000 check in the mail for someone they 
don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other major escrow services include i-Escrow of San Mateo,  
Calif. (http://www.iescrow.com) and Trade-direct of Tampa, Fla. 
(http://www.trade-direct.com). Many have struck deals with online auction 
and classified ad companies like eBay, OnSale, city Auction and 
Recycler.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Auction Universe of New York (http://www.auctionuniverse.com)  
recently started its own in-house escrow service known as BidSafe. 
</P>
<P>
	All report a steady climb in business, especially in recent  
months as word continues to get out that such services are 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hasn't caught on in a big enough way yet, but the growth  
month-to-month has been tremendous -- between 20- and 30 percent (in 
sales),'' said Pereira, echoing the growth rates of other escrow 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The vast majority of Internet transactions do go off without a  
hitch, says eBay spokesman Kevin Pursglove. EBay, the largest of 
the Internet auction sites, has various safety measures already in 
place, like an online ``feedback'' system that shows performance 
records of buyers and sellers and a newly instituted insurance 
program that provides limited coverage for purchased items. 
</P>
<P>
	Pursglove says using an escrow service is an additional safety  
step which should be considered when buying expensive items. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're getting into an area where the bid is $700, $800,  
$900, you'd be wise to take this extra step,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Purchases involving escrows have ranged from as low as $10 to as  
high as $50,000, the companies report. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides providing peace of mind for both buyer and seller,  
escrow services also help speed up the transaction because they 
allow credit cards to be used. 
</P>
<P>
	Those using BidSafe, for example, can expect to receive their  
merchandise within five days if they charge their purchases, vs. 10 
to 15 days if they mail a personal check, says Bonnie Schwartz, a 
vice president at Auction Universe, and creator of the BidSafe 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Smith, 42, of Pulaski, Tenn., says that has made her  
online business run so much smoother. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have to go hunting around and matching up payments,''  
said Smith, who sells Beanie Babies, Furbies, sports cards and 
other collectibles on Internet auctions like Auction Universe. 
</P>
<P>
	The escrow services also track the shipping services that  
deliver the goods. Buyers, for instance, can go online and quickly 
find out the location of their merchandise at various stages. 
</P>
<P>
	I-Escrow President Sherman Kwok says most transactions proceed  
like clockwork, although in a small number of instances, both 
parties have had to renegotiate a price because an item wasn't 
quite what the buyer wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	So, what has been the most unusual purchase involving escrows?  
An Egyptian cat mummy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're keeping an eye on that one,'' said Kwok.

<HEADLINE> Osgood Celebrates 5 Years As Host </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A while back, Charles Osgood returned from a  
trip to learn that one of his ``Sunday Morning'' colleagues had 
taken a job over at ``The CBS Evening News.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After wishing him well, Osgood mentioned how, ``in the past 24  
hours, at least 20 people sought me out to tell me they love 
`Sunday Morning.' 
</P>
<P>
	``Do me a favor: Let me know the first time someone tells you  
they love `The Evening News.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Osgood tags this little story with a rascally laugh. Meaning:  
It's nice, really nice, to be part of something people don't just 
value, but adore. And have, for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, ``CBS News Sunday Morning'' marked two gracious  
decades on the air. Now April brings another milestone: Osgood's 
fifth anniversary as host. 
</P>
<P>
	In retrospect, it seems obvious that no one but Osgood could  
have followed Charles Kuralt, who in 1994 decided to step down from 
the broadcast he inspired and, after 37 years, to retire from CBS 
News. (He died in 1997.) 
</P>
<P>
	But Osgood says he had no designs on Kuralt's ``Sunday Morning''  
stool, ``and it never for a second occurred to me that someone 
would ask me to do that show. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure there were some people who thought I was a poor  
choice,'' he adds, ``but most of the audience has been supportive 
from the very beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Small wonder. Like Kuralt before him, Osgood comes across as  
erudite, yet folksy. A gentleman without a trace of la-di-da. An 
optimist. Someone pleasant-looking, but clearly put on camera to do 
more than look good. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Osgood has been invisible for much of his career. His  
background is principally in radio -- and that's where the bulk of 
his duties remains. Monday through Friday, he arises at 2:30 a.m. 
to prepare his ``Osgood Files'' news commentaries, which air on CBS 
Radio at 6:25, 7:25, 8:25 and 9:25 a.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
	But each Sunday, after what he sugarcoats as ``sleeping in''  
until 5:30, Osgood arrives at CBS' Studio 45 and takes his place on 
the familiar terraced set. Seated beside his brawny easel, 
surrounded by Plexiglas panels branded with suns, he welcomes 
viewers to ``Sunday Morning'' at 9 a.m., then gently guides the 
broadcast through its 90 sublime minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Equipped with a voice that ripples like an underground stream  
and, more often than not, with a bow tie, the 66-year-old Osgood 
plays host to stories on Janet Reno or an opera star, on a new 
Broadway play or schoolgirls learning science. Then he introduces 
footage of saguaro cactuses. Just because. 
</P>
<P>
	Osgood also does the occasional story himself, with a feature on  
tap each Sunday in April. This week, he profiles Felipe Alou, 
Dominican manager of the Montreal Expos baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
	``But my role as host is pretty much that,'' Osgood says. ``I'm  
just one of the troops.'' For that, he won a 1998 Peabody Award -- 
known as broadcasting's Pulitzer Prize. 
</P>
<P>
	Osgood's entry into television was groundbreaking, and somewhat  
of a flop. He was general manager of the nation's first pay-TV 
service, marketed to viewers in Hartford, Conn., in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	Zenith had invented an over-the-air system called Phonevision.  
``It had a lot going for it,'' recalls Osgood. Then he smiles at 
its all-too-many shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would only work in black-and-white and took three hours to  
install. And if a plane flew overhead or a truck drove by, that 
would interfere not only with the picture, but with the 
(unscrambling) code, which would shut you down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Within a few months, Osgood was shut down, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Lucking into a job at ABC News in Manhattan, the man born  
Charles Osgood Wood dropped his surname (the network already had a 
newsman named Charles Woods) and, on the air as Charles Osgood, 
spent four years reporting for ABC radio and TV. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1967, he took a job as reporter on the CBS-owned WCBS  
Newsradio 88. Then, one fateful weekend, he was summoned to fill in 
at the anchor desk for the TV network's Saturday newscast. He had 
never before anchored anything on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the broadcast was over, I got a phone call from Mike  
Wallace, whom I had met only a couple of times: 'Charlie, I have 
some things I have to tell you.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Reviewing the tape of Osgood's TV debut, Wallace was typically  
direct: ``You look as if you're about to be executed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Osgood's self-appointed tutor wasn't finished. ``I'm gonna tell  
you something that nobody at CBS News will tell you: This is an 
acting job. You have to play the part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The advice took.  
</P>
<P>
	``I really came to understand what he was talking about,''  
Osgood says. ``Nobody knows everything, but you have to project an 
air of authority -- and without talking down to the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``After my second week, he called and said, `That was MUCH  
better.''' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1971, Osgood joined the CBS network. He hasn't been lectured  
to since.

<HEADLINE> Fans Pay the Cost of Higher Salaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The cost of those high baseball salaries is  
going straight to the fans. 
</P>
<P>
	The average price of a ticket increased 9.7 percent this year,  
from $13.59 to $14.91, according to the Team Marketing Report, 
which released its annual study Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox, who play in Fenway Park, the smallest stadium in  
the major leagues, remained the most expensive ticket in baseball 
after raising prices 16.6 percent to an average of $24.05 
</P>
<P>
	The World Series champion New York Yankees were once again  
second after a 13.8 percent rise to $23.33. The cost of the best 
box seats at Yankee Stadium has gone up from $25 in 1996 to $50 
this season. In addition, the Yankees last year added 60 
field-level seats that cost $16,000 per season -- $197.53 a game. 
The price of those seats remain unchanged this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle, which moves from the Kingdome to Safeco Field on July  
15, had the highest increase, a 27.2 percent rise to $19.01. The 
New York Mets raised prices 23.5 percent to an average of $19.98, 
Philadelphia 21.2 percent to $13.60, the Chicago Cubs 21.1 percent 
to $17.46 and Texas 20.9 percent to $19.93. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota again has the cheapest average ticket price, even  
after a 2.9 percent increase to $8.46. 
</P>
<P>
	Montreal, which decreased its average price 6 percent to $9.38,  
was 29th and Cincinnati was 28th at $9.71 after a 16 percent 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Expos, two other teams lowered their average  
prices, with Oakland going down 4.5 percent to $10.10 and Tampa Bay 
going down 3.1 percent to $15.08. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's average ticket price has gone up 42.6 percent since  
the 1994 strike, when it was $10.45. The average has increased 72.6 
percent from 1991, when TMR began its annual studies. 
</P>
<P>
	In comparison, the Consumer Price Index has gone up 1.0 percent  
in the last year, 12.1 percent since 1994 and 18.7 percent since 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the increases, baseball tickets remain far cheaper than  
seats for the other major U.S. sports. NFL ticket prices rose 4.7 
percent last season to $42.86, NBA prices went up 3.4 percent this 
season to $42.54 and NHL prices went up 2.5 percent to $42.79. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL tickets have increased 70 percent since 1991 and NBA tickets  
have gone up 83 percent since the 1991-92 season. TMR's NHL studies 
go back only to 1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fan Cost Index, which includes two average-price tickets,  
two average-price child tickets, four small soft drinks, two small 
beers, four hot dogs, parking, two programs and two adult caps, 
increased 6.8 percent to $121.36. The Yankees remained No. 1 in the 
index at $166.84, followed by Boston ($160.21) and the Mets 
($154.58). 
</P>
<P>
	Montreal had the lowest index at $87.87, with Oakland 29th at  
$92.78 and Milwaukee 28th at $95.81. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL's average was $244.98 last season. The NBA is at $240.26  
this season, the NHL at $238.97.

<HEADLINE> Grissom: `I Feel Young Again' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- He looks like the center fielder of old, and for  
Marquis Grissom, that means very, very young. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I'm a young man again,'' said Grissom, who  
refurbished his body and refashioned his mind this offseason after 
a year marked by physical breakdowns and mental fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't time that caught up with Grissom last season as much  
as it was his reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think playing with injuries, he just realized that he  
shouldn't have done it, because it just hurt him more than it 
helped him,'' Milwaukee Brewers general manager Sal Bando said. 
``He wanted to set an example and he knows he's got that reputation 
of being a gamer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grissom, 31, was bothered much of last season by a high  
hamstring strain that forced him to alter his batting stance, his 
running style and his defensive techniques, which resulted in a bad 
back and a sore right throwing shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a mess,'' said Grissom, who managed to stay off the  
disabled list and appear in 142 games nevertheless. 
</P>
<P>
	But for the first time in his career, Grissom looked like an old  
man. 
</P>
<P>
	``I shouldn't have been out there,'' Grissom admitted. ``It all  
started with my heel in Cleveland (in 1997). I didn't rehab it and 
then I strained my hamstring. The last two years, I've been at 
about 50 or 60 percent. Last year it just caught up with me. My 
speed left. Balls were falling. Guys were running on me. People 
said my skills were eroding. I knew I was hurt and I didn't want to 
accept it. All those things are reversed now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't just Grissom's body that was hurting last year,  
either. 
</P>
<P>
	He was bogged down mentally and emotionally from the loss of his  
sister, Mary, to AIDS, and his separation from Tia, the mother of 
his three children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mentally, I feel like I was at 10 percent,'' Grissom said.  
``It's been a rough ride these last two years, both on the inside 
and the outside, being beat up and worn down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first thing Grissom did in the offseason after ironing  
things out with Tia was let all his injuries heal with the help of 
doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, on Dec. 21, he hired a personal trainer to work on speed,  
agility balance, diet and nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was mad, stuck in traffic, cursing. But I realized it's just  
something I had to do,'' Grissom said. ``I owe those guys big-time. 
I tell them they put me back together again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like all the king's horses and all the king's men.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's the best thing that ever happened to me,'' Grissom said  
of his work at Pro Train in suburban Atlanta. ``It's definitely a 
place I'll be at every year after this season. Now I feel good, eat 
good, sleep good. Now my goal is to spend 10 more years 
competing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grissom's renewal was evident from Day 1 at camp as he stretched  
doubles into triples, chased down balls in the gap and nailed 
runners trying to test his arm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad to be here without feeling sore every day,'' Grissom  
said. ``Last year I had doubts if I could go out and do these 
things. But no more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bando said the difference in Grissom's game is amazing.  
</P>
<P>
	``I see a player that everyone else saw three years ago,'' Bando  
said. ``I don't know if he'll get the young legs back, but he'll 
obviously have better legs than he had last year and hopefully less 
injuries. He's still a young man now. He's not by any means at the 
end of his career or on the down cycle of his career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grissom said he enjoys the game like he used to.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm physically healthy. I'm eating right, working out right,  
running right. It's been wonderful,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like a kid again. I feel like I belong. I feel like my  
head's back out there with confidence. My kids are fine. Their 
mother and I get along, everything's great. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be all right this year.''

<HEADLINE>  Some Want Allies To Contribute More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Italy and France are contributing about 40  
warplanes apiece to the NATO war effort in Yugoslavia, while the 
Netherlands is providing 16 F-16 jet fighters, Turkey has chipped 
in 11, Belgium 10, Norway six. All told, America's NATO allies have 
earmarked more than 200 planes to operation Allied Force, roughly 
the same as the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some analysts feel the United States is shouldering a  
disproportionate share of NATO's burden, both in the current effort 
and in general. Some even believe the Europeans ought to deal with 
the Kosovo problem with no effort at all by Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sooner or later, we have to say (to the Europeans) that if the  
Russians attack, we are with you. But the brush fires are your 
responsibility,'' said David Acheson, president and chief executive 
officer of the Atlantic Council, a pro-NATO grouping. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon defends the American role in the air war and the  
European contribution to it, and does not consider the U.S. 
contribution disproportionate. 
</P>
<P>
	Helmut Sonnenfeldt, who monitors NATO issues from the Brookings  
Institution, says the equivalency in the number of planes between 
the U.S. and its allies in the Balkan war effort overstates the 
allies' contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	This comparison, he says, fails to account for the  
sophistication of some of the American aircraft -- each 
high-performance F-117 bomber costs $45 million, for example -- 
compared with the Europeans' planes, mostly the far cheaper F-16's. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Tomas Valasek of the Center for Defense Information:  
``Nobody has what the U.S. has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sonnenfeldt also notes that only Britain among the European  
allies is capable of firing a sea-based cruise missile. The U.S. 
has six cruise missile-capable vessels deployed for Yugoslavia 
duty. 
</P>
<P>
	For some allied countries, participation in the Yugoslav war  
effort is out of the question. Luxembourg, for example, has no air 
force. Iceland has no military at all. 
</P>
<P>
	France's military budget, at $47 billion, is second among NATO  
allies to that of the United States, at $267 billion. Germany is 
third at $42 billion, according to CIA estimates. Given this 
century's history, there is little sympathy on either side of the 
Atlantic for a significant increase in German defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Deciding just how much each NATO country should contribute to  
the alliance has never been an exact science. The United States 
spends about 3.4 percent of its gross national product on defense 
while the remaining allies spend an average of about 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Europeans can justify the discrepancy by pointing out that  
the United States has security responsibilities well beyond Europe 
-- Japan and the Korean peninsula being the most noteworthy 
examples. 
</P>
<P>
	A counterargument is that the United States has only slightly  
more than half of the population of its 18 NATO allies combined yet 
the defense spending of these allies amounts to only about 60 
percent of the U.S. defense budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Acheson, son of the late Dean Acheson, a NATO founding father  
and former secretary of state, likens Europe to a dependent 
incapable of acting alone. 
</P>
<P>
	The Europeans ``ought to provide the forces, capability and the  
money to keep order in Europe,'' said Acheson, emphasizing that he 
was speaking for himself and not his organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Europeans lack the will because they always have looked to  
the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Kupchan, of the Council on Foreign Relations, says it's  
illusory to suppose the Europeans could handle the Yugoslavia 
operation on their own, saying they lack the intelligence 
capabilities and satellite reconnaissance. 
</P>
<P>
	Another source of concern is that the Europeans are reducing  
their defense spending while the Clinton administration, after 
slashing military spending for years, is planning sizable 
increases. This, presumably, will accelerate European dependence on 
its big neighbor to the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonnenfeldt says European defense thinking is still largely  
based on the Cold War era concept that large armies are needed to 
ward off a ground invasion from the East. 
</P>
<P>
	But he says he is encouraged by a British-French initiative that  
would let European Union countries act independently while 
retaining their role within NATO. The initiative was a recognition 
of Europe's need to handle crises when the United States does not 
get involved. Washington has welcomed the plan enthusiastically.

<HEADLINE> 9 Illegal Immigrants Dead in Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALPINE, Calif. (AP) -- A surprise snowstorm stranded Mexicans  
trying to cross a mountainous region of the U.S. border, leaving at 
least nine dead. A search with dogs and helicopters rescued more 
than 130 others Friday, some of whom had wandered for days dressed 
in T-shirts and tennis shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those saved were two sisters between the ages of 5 and 7.  
They were in good conditions but their parents had not been 
located, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 140 illegal immigrants died last year crossing from  
Mexico into San Diego and Imperial counties in California, said 
Bill Strassberger, a spokesman for the federal Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. About 20 had died this year before Friday's 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Several inches of snow were already on the ground in the  
Cleveland National Forest when another storm brought flurries 
Thursday night. Several groups of migrants were caught unprepared 
as they tried to cross from Tecate into San Diego County, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities heard word of their plight when a woman, freezing  
from the cold, sought aid from a rancher Thursday night and said 
her husband and friend were lost in the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	The rancher called U.S. Border Patrol agents, who found their  
bodies. Another group of seven immigrants was found two hours 
later, triggering a full-scale rescue operation. 
</P>
<P>
	By midafternoon Friday, U.S. authorities had rescued more than  
50 people suffering from exposure and hypothermia. Seven were 
confirmed dead, and the toll was expected to rise, Strassberger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexican authorities found two people dead and 80 people stranded  
on their side of the border, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Border Patrol supervisor Roy Villareal said several of the  
survivors said smugglers had abandoned the immigrants when the 
weather got bad. 
</P>
<P>
	Crossing the border from Mexico to the Alpine area takes two to  
four days, depending on the weather, physical condition and 
familiarity with the terrain, Villareal said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the rescued immigrants, wearing only light jackets,  
T-shirts and tennis shoes, told agents they had been walking for 
about three days. 
</P>
<P>
	The Border Patrol, with the help of other agencies, used dogs  
and helicopters to conduct the searches in wet, cold and foggy 
conditions.

<HEADLINE> Silverbulletday Will Race Keeneland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Silverbulletday puts her five-race winning  
streak on the line against five challengers in Saturday's Ashland 
Stakes, the highlight of the opening weekend of Keeneland's 15-day 
spring meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bob Baffert-trained filly, who was last year's champion  
juvenile, drew the outside post position on Thursday and will carry 
123 pounds to the 115 being carried by the rest of the field in the 
$500,000-added, 8 1/2-furlong race for 3-year-old fillies. 
</P>
<P>
	The meet, which begins today and continues through April 23,  
also includes the running of the Blue Grass Stakes on April 10, 
three weeks before the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Winner of eight of her nine starts and champion of last fall's  
Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies, Silverbulletday comes into the 
Ashland Stakes off a win in the Fair Grounds Oaks. She is to be 
ridden Saturday by Jerry Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
	One potential challenger is another Baffert-trained filly, Tout  
Charmant. She finished a neck behind Baffert's other 3-year-old 
filly star, Excellent Meeting, in the Santa Anita Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Excellent Meeting and Silverbulletday have both been mentioned  
as possible Kentucky Derby entrants, and Baffert has not ruled that 
out, though he said earlier this week that they are being pointed 
toward the April 30 on Kentucky Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the field, from the rail out, with jockey for the  
Ashland Stakes: Marley Vale, Robby Alvarado; Gold From The West, 
Francisco Torres; Tout Charmant, Shane Sellers; Here I Go, Robby 
Davis; Waltz On By, Craig Perret. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the field for the 75th running of the $750,000,  
nine-furlong Blue Grass Stakes is shaping up as star-studded. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the expected entrants are Vicar, Wondertross and Cat  
Thief, who finished 1-2-3 in the March 13 Florida Derby. Others 
pointing toward the Blue Grass are Louisiana Derby winner 
Kimberlite Pipe and Prado's Landing, a Godolphin Stable contender 
who has trained in the United Arab Emirates. 
</P>
<P>
	Also a possibility is Answer Lively, winner of last fall's  
Breeders' Cup Juvenile and a runner-up in the Risen Star Stakes and 
the Louisiana Derby in his last two starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Carl Nafzger said the depth of the Blue Grass field has  
him wondering if he shouldn't have sent Vicar to Saturday's Santa 
Anita Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Santa Anita Derby is a Grade III compared to this field,''  
he said. ``There's no doubt it's an easier spot than this one. But 
the Blue Grass Stakes should tell us something about the caliber of 
horses that are going to be in the Derby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four Blue Grass Stakes winners this decade have gone on to win  
the Kentucky Derby -- Unbridled, Strike The Gold, Sea Hero and 
Thunder Gulch. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lexington Stakes on April 18 will be the choice for trainers  
and owners making last-minute decisions about whether to enter a 
horse in the Derby. Among the possible entrants are trainer Carlos 
Morales' Yankee Victor and Baffert's Straight Man, who faded badly 
in the stretch of Saturday's Gallery Furniture.com Stakes and 
finished fourth behind Stephen Got Even.

<HEADLINE> Congress Criticizes Kosovo Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration's Kosovo policy is  
under attack from Capitol Hill with one key Senate ally accusing 
the White House of issuing Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic a 
``virtual invitation'' to capture American soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and other  
Republicans joined in, while other lawmakers cautioned that critics 
should give the U.S.-led NATO mission more time. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a career Navy fighter pilot, urged  
President Clinton to ``heavily intensify our bombing campaign and 
then consider all other options,'' including sending in group 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it would be a gross violation of the Geneva conventions  
for the Serbs to try three U.S. soldiers who were captured 
Wednesday near the Macedonian-Yugoslav border. ``The Vietnamese 
threatened the same thing in 1965 and our reaction was the same and 
they never put any of us on trial,'' McCain, who spent more than 
seven years as a POW, recalled on NBC's ``Today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the harshest political fire directed at the  
administration came from a member of Clinton's own party. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is incomprehensible to me that the U.S. military would send  
a three-man patrol near the borders of Serbia,'' Sen. Robert 
Torricelli, D-N.J., said in a telephone interview. ``It was a 
virtual invitation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a very worthwhile humanitarian objective, but it was  
always a triumph of hope over reality that a limited bombing 
campaign would ever break the will of the Serbian military,'' he 
added. ``It was never a very realistic plan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Sen. John Warner, R-Va., who chairs the Senate Armed  
Services Committee, told reporters that the downing last week of a 
now-rescued American pilot shows ``we were on full notice that 
Serbia would like to seize a ... NATO service person. And that's 
precisely what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But at a briefing earlier Thursday, Warner said he also learned  
of ``positive signs that this air campaign is causing problems for 
Milosevic's deployed troops conducting ethnic cleansing in 
Kosovo.'' They include reports that military vehicles were running 
short on fuel and that Yugoslav troops were running out of food and 
ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lane Evans, D-Ill., a member of the House Armed Services  
Committee, cautioned critics to ``stand tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When we're engaged in hostilities, it's no time to question  
the president,'' Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans issued more tempered statements. Senate  
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., for example, virtually 
repeated words Clinton used earlier in the day in Norfolk, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Milosevic should make no mistake: He will be held  
accountable for any harm done to these American servicemen and must 
guarantee their safe return,'' Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., who traveled with Clinton  
Thursday to Norfolk, said in a telephone interview that Americans 
should understand that airstrikes were planned to last ``many, many 
weeks. We're at the beginning of the campaign, not at the middle 
and not near the end. We can't judge the success of that campaign 
... until the campaign is completed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., urged the  
administration to ``keep up its efforts to stop the violence 
against the Kosovar people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the criticism kept coming.  
</P>
<P>
	``The policy is not working, it's counterproductive. It's like  
putting gasoline on a fire,'' said Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., 
another member of the Armed Service Committee. ``We don't have 
anything to negotiate with. We are in a pickle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torricelli, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign  
Committee, is a frequent Clinton ally. But he said doubts about the 
mission have festered among Senate Democrats for weeks and that the 
Senate's 58-41 vote last week in support of the airstrikes did not 
accurately reflect members' sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm concerned about the quality of the diplomatic and military  
advice that President Clinton is receiving. I don't believe this 
mission was properly defined or executed,'' Torricelli said, adding 
that he voiced those sentiments to national security adviser Sandy 
Berger the day of the vote.

<HEADLINE> Trial of 2nd Marine Goes to Jury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A prosecutor today said a Marine  
aviator who admitted destroying a tape made before an accident that 
killed 20 people was ``the perfect conspirator.'' The defense urged 
lenience for ``a panic decision made in 20 or 30 seconds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody trusted him,'' the prosecutor, Maj. Stu Couch, said  
in his closing statement to a military jury that will recommend a 
sentence for Capt. Joseph Schweitzer. 
</P>
<P>
	``That makes the perfect conspirator, somebody who has that  
amount of trust built up over a period of time. ... That's what's 
wrong with a conspiracy among officers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the morning, a military jury began deliberating whether  
to recommend options including sending Schweitzer to prison or 
kicking him out of the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch urged the jury to recommend both dismissal and a prison  
sentence. He didn't specify what length of sentence he thought 
should be imposed except to say the maximum, 10 years, was too 
much. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney David Beck said in his closing statement that  
dismissal from the Marines was too harsh a penalty. He suggested a 
letter of reprimand would be sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do not judge Captain Schweitzer's 10 years in the Marine Corps  
... based on a panic decision made in 20 or 30 seconds,'' he said. 
He told jurors that Schweitzer ``looked you in the eye'' and told 
the truth when he testified Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y., pleaded guilty Monday to  
obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice for 
destroying the tape after the Feb. 3, 1998, accident near Cavalese, 
Italy. He was the navigator of the EA-6B Prowler that severed a ski 
lift cable, sending a gondola crashing to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	While Schweitzer faces up to 10 years in prison, dismissal from  
the service and forfeiture of pay, a more lenient sentence is 
possible under a plea arrangement that has not been disclosed. A 
judge will impose either the sentence recommended by the jury or 
the one agreed to as part of Monday's plea bargain, whichever is 
more lenient. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch told the jury today how after the jet piloted by Capt.  
Richard Ashby cut the cable, it landed at the Aviano, Italy, air 
base with a wing sliced nearly in half. 
</P>
<P>
	``After all this and everything they've been through, what is  
the first thing on their mind? The tape,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer testified Thursday that he was concerned his face was  
on the tape, which was made before the accident, and that it would 
be used in media reports about the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian media portrayed the radar-jamming jet's four-man  
crew as ``Rambos'' and ``air assassins,'' Schweitzer said. ``All I 
could think about was my face and I didn't want anybody to see 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During more than an hour of emotional testimony Thursday,  
Schweitzer became choked up as he recalled learning that people had 
died. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some days I just don't want to get out of bed  
because the burden is heavy,'' he said. ``I deal with that every 
day. It's part of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He called himself ``an embarrassment to the Marine Corps.''  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors dropped 20 counts of manslaughter against Schweitzer  
after Ashby, 32, of Mission Viejo, Calif., was acquitted of the 
same charges. Ashby still faces a trial on obstruction charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer said he and Ashby switched the tape he shot for a  
blank tape after making an emergency landing at their Aviano, 
Italy, air base. Four or five days later, Schweitzer dropped the 
tape into a bonfire. He said he had told his commanding officer 
that he had a camera but didn't use it on the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Other witnesses Thursday included one of the Prowler's back-seat  
crewmen, Capt. Chandler Seagraves, 29, of Nineveh, Ind. He said the 
crew felt isolated after the accident, and that may have led to the 
destruction of the tape. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed like nobody actually cared what happened,'' said  
Seagraves, who was granted immunity from prosecution in exchange 
for his testimony. ``That started scaring all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charges against him and the other backseat crewman, Capt.  
William Raney of Englewood, Colo., were dropped last year.

<HEADLINE> Judge Sets Precedent In Gun Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- A federal judge dismissed charges against  
a man accused of breaking an arcane law that prohibits someone 
under a restraining order from owning a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal experts said Friday the decision set an important  
precedent that could be the basis for challenges to other 
gun-control laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``If appealed, this could be the springboard for a definitive  
Supreme Court ruling on the Second Amendment,'' said Stephen 
Holbrook, an attorney who represented sheriffs in a successful 
challenge to provisions of the federal Brady gun-control law. 
``That could have wide implications.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case revolves around Timothy Joe Emerson, a doctor in San  
Angelo who was arrested last year and charged with violating a 
restraining order after brandishing a handgun in front of his wife 
and her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys argued that Emerson has a right to own guns  
under the Second Amendment and that any law infringing upon that is 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Sam Cummings agreed, ruling on Thursday that  
the Second Amendment right to bear arms is a protected individual 
right -- and not just a right belonging to an organized militia, as 
federal prosecutors contended. 
</P>
<P>
	Cummings said he based his decision on a ``historical  
examination of the right to bear arms, from English antecedents to 
the drafting of the Second Amendment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers planned to appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	Activists on both sides of the issue agreed that the decision  
could be the first in which a judge specifically called a law 
unconstitutional because it infringed on an individual's Second 
Amendment rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has monumental potential,'' said former state Sen. Jerry  
Patterson, who authored the law that allows Texans to carry 
concealed handguns. ``If federal prosecutors proceed with an 
appeal, this could be the case that the court uses to directly rule 
on the issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-gun activists, however, assailed the case as an anomaly  
that will probably be overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	``No gun-control law has ever been struck down because of the  
Second Amendment,'' said Brian Morton, a spokesman for Center to 
Prevent Handgun Violence in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all respect to the judge, this goes almost totally  
contrary to all decisions on the matter,'' Morton said. ``This is a 
case that is screaming for appeal.''

<HEADLINE> Yahoo! Reveals Internet Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The president of Yahoo! declared Thursday that  
three companies will dominate the Internet by the end of next year 
and his company aims to be one of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Mallett's bold call came as he announced that Yahoo!, the  
Internet's leading search and directory service, will pay $6.08 
billion buy Broadcast.com, the top provider of TV and radio 
programming on the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect three companies to emerge from the pack exiting the  
year 2000,'' Mallet said in an interview. And Yahoo!, Microsoft 
Network and America Online ``are clearly starting to separate 
themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To ensure Yahoo!'s position, Mallett said the company will  
continue to make acquisitions and expand in three key areas: media, 
communications, and direct services. 
</P>
<P>
	This is Yahoo!'s second major deal this year. In January, the  
Santa Clara, Calif.-based company announced it was buying GeoCities 
Inc., a Web service used by more than 3 million people to publish 
their writings, post their family photos or try to sell things. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile America Online, the largest Internet and online  
service, recently acquired the software company Netscape as it 
tries to dominate Web services for both individuals and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft is assembling a large array of Web services as well,  
including travel, car buying and entertainment listings. Its 
Microsoft Network online service is a rival to AOL although it has 
been far less successful. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to these powerful competitors, Mallett should be  
looking over his shoulder for several others. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T just bought the big cable TV company Tele-Communications  
Inc. and a stake in the high-speed Internet service provider AtHome 
Corp. -- moves that will make it a major force as consumers abandon 
slow-moving telephone hookups to the Net and switch to much faster 
cable TV links. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com is positioning itself as the Web's retailing leader.  
The online bookseller this week launched its own auction service 
and recently acquired stakes in Pets.com, a pet supplies retailer, 
and Drugstore.com, an online pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditional broadcasting companies like CBS and Disney's ABC are  
also hunting for Internet acquisitions. And, Cisco Systems, the 
computer networking equipment company, wants to replace the 
telephone with the computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Mallett ``is only talking about next year,'' said Jim  
Balderston, an industry analyst with Zona Research Inc. 
``Twenty-four to 36 months from now, the order could shift, and 
there could be newcomers, and the traditional media companies might 
come in dumping a boatload of cash and making their presences 
known.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Time is of the essence. The Internet industry is both expanding  
and consolidating at a rapid pace. New companies go public almost 
daily and quickly become targets or suitors in corporate takeovers. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the leading Web companies are looking for strategic  
acquisitions that reflect the integration of computer, television 
and telephone services with commerce, information and 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, many consumers haven't been able to keep up with the  
blurring changes of the Internet. Most home computers are still a 
few years away from having the high-speed access to make it easy to 
watch movies online. 
</P>
<P>
	But Todd Wagner, chief executive of Dallas-based Broadcast.com,  
said ``This is happening much more quickly than any of us ever 
anticipated.'' A few years ago, for example, audio on the Internet 
was full of static like an AM radio. Today, it's nearly CD quality, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcast.com's audio and video business is expected to take off  
as high-speed access to the Internet -- and a wealth of new services 
it brings -- becomes more prevalent in the home and office. 
</P>
<P>
	However, like most Internet companies, Broadcast.com makes no  
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Still the 10 percent premium Yahoo! paid over the market price  
of its stock didn't bother investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``What else is new?,'' said Charles Lax, a general partner with  
SoftBank Venture Capital, Yahoo!'s biggest shareholder. 
``High-speed access (to the Internet) is very important, and this 
is just an anchor acquisition for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! stock rose $11.37 1/2 to $179.75 on the Nasdaq Stock Market,  
where Broadcast.com's shares rose $11.81 1/4 to $130. The stock 
movement upped the price of the deal from an initial value of $5.7 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	While it may be too early to call the winners in the Internet  
race, underestimating Yahoo! would be a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1994 by Stanford University doctoral candidates David  
Filo and Jerry Yang, Yahoo!'s turbocharged stock, which has risen 
264 percent in the past 12 months, has turned into a currency to 
snap up rivals.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Hits 29-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's unemployment rate declined to a  
29-year low of 4.2 percent in March -- and was the lowest on record 
for Hispanics -- despite continued job losses in manufacturing and 
sluggish job growth elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The seasonally adjusted rate, based on a survey of households,  
fell from 4.4 percent in February and was the lowest since February 
1970, when the rate was also 4.2 percent, the Labor Department said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate for Hispanics, which fell from 6.7 percent in February  
to 5.8 percent in March, was the lowest on record since the 
department began calculating a separate rate for the group in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a separate survey of employers belied the strong  
picture. It showed employers added just 46,000 jobs, after seasonal 
adjustment, to their payrolls. It was the smallest number since 
jobs declined in January 1996 when a blizzard struck the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	That much-smaller-than-expected advance contrasts with gains of  
297,000 in February and 217,000 in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists said demand for labor remains strong and they  
explained away at least part of the weak job growth as a 
statistical anomaly caused by the fact that this year's hiring 
trends haven't matched the usual seasonal pattern. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was the warmest winter since 1895, which made seasonal  
adjustment a nightmare,'' said economist David Orr of First Union 
Corp. in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless the bond market took the weak number as a sign that  
the Federal Reserve will see no need to dampen the economy with an 
interest-rate increase. The interest rate on the benchmark 30-year 
Treasury bond slipped to 5.60 percent from 5.67 percent late 
Thursday. The stock market was closed for Good Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers, many hit hard by the global economic slump that  
began in Asia near two years ago, cut 35,000 jobs last month, 
bringing the decline for the past year to 381,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past year, losses have been most severe at factories  
making industrial machinery, apparel and electrical equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction hiring fell by a seasonally adjusted 47,000 jobs in  
March after the actual gain in jobs fell short of the normal 
advance for the start of spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of the underlying strength in the industry coupled  
with the unusually mild winter, many construction workers who 
typically would have been hired in March were already on employers' 
payrolls,'' said Katharine G. Abraham, commissioner of the Bureau 
of Labor Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	Mining, which includes oil-drilling, lost 7,000 jobs in March,  
bringing losses over the past year to 55,000. Agricultural services 
and real estate also recorded declines. 
</P>
<P>
	Hiring at restaurants and bars fell short of the usual seasonal  
gains. 
</P>
<P>
	However, robust employment growth continued in engineering and  
management services, health care, educational services and 
amusement and recreation. There also were gains in computer and 
data processing and finance and insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	By demographic group, in addition to the drop for Hispanics, the  
jobless rate fell from 3.8 percent to 3.6 percent for whites, from 
8.3 percent to 8.1 percent for blacks and from 3.7 percent to 3.2 
percent for men. It rose from 3.8 percent to 3.9 percent for women 
and from 14.1 percent to 14.3 percent for teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate for adults who dropped out of high school fell from 7.5  
percent to 6.1 percent. For high school graduates it was unchanged 
at 3.4 percent and, for college graduates, unchanged at 1.9 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Average hourly earnings for non-farm, non-supervisory workers  
rose 3 cents in March to $13.09. They're up 3.6 percent from a year 
earlier. The average workweek declined by a tenth of an hour to 
34.5 hours.

<HEADLINE> Alomar Happy To Put '98 Behind </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Sandy Alomar remembers the jokes back in 1990  
when the San Diego Padres traded him to the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	``People would say to me, `You're going to Cleveland?' Now  
everybody wants to go to Cleveland,'' he said. ``It's been the 
comeback city of the century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Cleveland is hoping Alomar can make a comeback of his own.  
</P>
<P>
	Nagging injuries contributed to an awful 1998 season for  
Cleveland's six-time All-Star catcher. When the Indians' year ended 
in New York last October with a Game 6 loss in the AL championship 
series, Alomar was in so much pain he could barely make it to his 
clubhouse locker. 
</P>
<P>
	He had only been able to play that night after receiving an  
epidural block to ease the pain in his lower body. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was so numb I couldn't feel my legs,'' he said. ``I was  
afraid of tripping running down to first base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With his left knee constantly throbbing and his back tight,  
Alomar batted just .235 -- his lowest average since 1991 -- with six 
homers and 44 RBIs in '98. 
</P>
<P>
	Those aren't the worst numbers in baseball history, but they  
came after a storybook season in 1997 when every ball he hit fell 
in and every big moment for the Indians' seemed to be Alomar's, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
	He played through the pain last year, somehow managing to stay  
off the disabled list while playing 117 games. After undergoing 
arthroscopic surgery on his knee in late October, he decided to 
stay away from baseball and didn't catch, throw or hit this winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he rehabilitated the knee and worked out with hopes of  
catching 125 games this year. 
</P>
<P>
	He's healthy, he's happy and although he's not hitting this  
spring, Alomar has put the problems of 1998 behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really looking forward to this season,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	One of the biggest reasons for Alomar's happiness is that he has  
been reunited this year with his brother, Robbie, the Indians' new 
second baseman. The two were teammates for seven games with San 
Diego in '90 before Sandy was dealt to Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having Robbie around is really going to help Sandy this  
season,'' first baseman Jim Thome said. ``It's great for us, but I 
think it's even better for Sandy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It'll certainly cut down on the Alomar brothers' phone bills.  
</P>
<P>
	In the past, Sandy, an emotional player, has taken his hitting  
slumps badly. It wouldn't be uncommon for him to call Robbie for 
advice following an 0-for-3 night. 
</P>
<P>
	All he has to do now is walk across the clubhouse.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to really hit me until we go out on the field  
(on opening day) and they say, `play ball,''' Sandy said. 
</P>
<P>
	This spring, Sandy has been working with Indians hitting coach  
Charlie Manuel on being more patient at the plate. By taking more 
pitches, Alomar hopes to get ahead in the count and create better 
hitting situations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of my problem is I make contact,'' he said. ``I don't  
strike out much. Charlie and I talked and he said, `You've got a 
good problem.' What happened last year was I made contact early in 
the count. Late in the count I'm a pretty good defensive hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	``But when you're hitting good balls early in the count, your  
batting average is going to suffer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to being more selective with what he swings at,  
Alomar is trying to delay when he swings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm letting the ball get deeper in the zone,'' he said. ``so I  
can see it longer.''

<HEADLINE> Feds Subpeona Foreman to Testify </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Former heavyweight champion George Foreman  
will likely testify later this month before a federal grand jury 
investigating boxing's sanctioning organizations, according to his 
lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman has been subpoenaed by the panel looking into corruption  
charges in boxing, Larry Wechsler said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My understanding is that George is just one small piece of  
this rather broad-ranging investigation,'' the Washington attorney 
told The Record of Hackensack. ``The government views him as a 
witness and a victim, and I assume they view other boxers in the 
same way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wechsler said he didn't know whether anyone had extorted money  
from Foreman to set up a fight or improve his ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	The 51-year-old former champion, a familiar figure in TV  
commercials, was initially scheduled to appear before the grand 
jury on Wednesday, but would likely testify later this month, said 
Wechsler. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources told The Record the grand jury is investigating whether  
the New Jersey-heaquartered International Boxing Federation sold 
rankings and arranged fights in return for kickbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The payments, sometimes disguised as consulting fees, were made  
by fighter managers, to promoters and sanctioning groups, according 
to unnamed sources cited by The Star-Ledger of Newark, which 
disclosed the investigation last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal grand jurors have subpoenaed all IBF records since 1982  
on rankings and contracts for fights, as well as checks, invoices, 
expense forms and telephone records, said IBF attorney Walter 
Stone. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want virtually all written records since the start of the  
organization,'' Stone said. ``Whatever the IBF has, that's what the 
U.S. Attorney's Office is going to get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors declined comment on the investigation.  
</P>
<P>
	The IBF also came under scrutiny last month from law enforcement  
agencies in New York following the controversial draw in the March 
13 heavyweight championship bout between Evander Holyfield and 
Lennox Lewis. Of the three judges, only the IBF-picked judge had 
Holyfield winning the fight many believed Lewis dominated. 
</P>
<P>
	The IBF and two other sanctioning groups -- the WBA and WBC -- by  
their rules and rankings, play a large role in determining whom a 
boxer fights. Boxers who defy the groups risk losing the chance to 
be declared a champion and earn large purses. 
</P>
<P>
	``How these different boxers are rated and whether they get to  
championship fights can be worth millions of dollars,'' Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
	IBF president Robert Lee has denied the allegations.  
</P>
<P>
	``For 15 years, people have been making allegations against Bob  
Lee that have proven false and hollow and gone absolutely 
nowhere,'' said Gerald Krovatin, Lee's attorney. ``I have no reason 
to believe that this investigation will be any different.''

<HEADLINE> DeGregorio Is RI's New Hoop Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH KINGSTOWN, R.I. (AP) -- Jerry DeGregorio, an assistant  
under Jim Harrick, was appointed interim coach at Rhode Island on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick got the university's hopes up by saying he had decided  
against taking the coaching job at Georgia and then doing an abrupt 
about-face on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	DeGregorio is among the candidates who will be considered for  
the permanent job. He is considered the team's best recruiter and a 
mentor to sophomore star Lamar Odom. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jerry has done an excellent job for us the last two years,''  
athletic director Ron Petro said. ``I am confident that he can 
handle the responsibilities of the basketball program while we 
search for a new head coach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DeGregorio, 37, was an assistant at Hofstra from 1985-88 and  
later was head coach at Mattatuck Community College. 
</P>
<P>
	The school formed a committee to find a successor. Odom was  
placed on the committee, a move that could mean he will remain at 
Rhode Island and not join the NBA draft.

<HEADLINE> Good Morning America Ratings Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bringing in Diane Sawyer and Charles Gibson as  
hosts has paid off in heartening ratings news for ABC's ``Good 
Morning America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the first three months of 1999, ``Good Morning America''  
increased its average audience to 3.93 million from 3.29 million in 
the fourth quarter of 1998, according to Nielsen Media Research 
figures released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The program is still second to NBC's ``Today,'' which had an  
average audience of 6.15 million people. CBS's ``This Morning'' was 
third with 3.08 million, Nielsen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sawyer and Gibson began as temporary hosts in January when the  
ratings slide at ``Good Morning America'' accelerated. ABC isn't 
talking about how long the new team will stay on the air. But 
success may mean continued early-morning wakeup calls for both of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, we're pleased that people are tuning in,'' ABC  
spokeswoman Sonya McNair said. ``As we all know, this is a 
marathon. We've said from the beginning our focus remains on 
improving the broadcast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Good Morning America'' ratings are still virtually  
identical to those for the first three months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today'' had its second highest quarterly rating ever,  
executive producer Jeff Zucker said. Only the first three months of 
last year, when the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke, were higher for 
NBC's dominant morning show. 
</P>
<P>
	About a million more people watched the three network morning  
news shows during the first quarter than during the last three 
months of 1998. Zucker said some increase in viewership is common 
when people return to their routines after the holidays 
</P>
<P>
	CBS has to be concerned, however, about the increased distance  
between ``This Morning'' and ``Good Morning America.'' CBS is 
talking to former ``Today'' host Bryant Gumbel about returning to 
morning television.

<HEADLINE> Alomar Happy To Put '98 Behind </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Sandy Alomar remembers the jokes back in 1990  
when the San Diego Padres traded him to the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	``People would say to me, `You're going to Cleveland?' Now  
everybody wants to go to Cleveland,'' he said. ``It's been the 
comeback city of the century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Cleveland is hoping Alomar can make a comeback of his own.  
</P>
<P>
	Nagging injuries contributed to an awful 1998 season for  
Cleveland's six-time All-Star catcher. When the Indians' year ended 
in New York last October with a Game 6 loss in the AL championship 
series, Alomar was in so much pain he could barely make it to his 
clubhouse locker. 
</P>
<P>
	He had only been able to play that night after receiving an  
epidural block to ease the pain in his lower body. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was so numb I couldn't feel my legs,'' he said. ``I was  
afraid of tripping running down to first base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With his left knee constantly throbbing and his back tight,  
Alomar batted just .235 -- his lowest average since 1991 -- with six 
homers and 44 RBIs in '98.

<HEADLINE>  Jerusalem Pilgrims Mark Good Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Thousands of pilgrims, some clutching large  
wooden crosses, walked through the rosemary-scented alleys of 
Jerusalem's Old City in a Good Friday procession today, retracing 
Jesus' step to his crucifixion. 
</P>
<P>
	Franciscan monks led pilgrims from around the world along the  
Via Dolorosa, or Way of Sorrows, which begins at the traditional 
site of Jesus' trial and ends at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, 
believed to be built over the place of his crucifixion and burial. 
</P>
<P>
	Worshippers sang hymns and read prayers in Arabic, Italian,  
English and several other languages. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been my dream to get here and now after 60 years I  
finally made it,'' said Vinge Bester from Arlington, Va., as she 
and other members of her tour group joined the slow procession. 
</P>
<P>
	A California group re-enacted Jesus' last walk in full costume,  
with one man dressed as Jesus, crowned with thorns and his face 
streaked with blood. 
</P>
<P>
	The man playing Jesus, Gilbert Peru, collapsed from time to time  
under the weight of the cross as actors dressed as Roman soldiers 
whipped his bare back. ``Help him, he is innocent!'' shouted Joanne 
Petraella, a pilgrim portraying the Virgin Mary. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, the procession halted as tens of thousands of  
Muslims made their way home from noon prayers at the Al Aqsa 
Mosque, just a few yards from the Via Dolorosa. 
</P>
<P>
	There was some pushing and shoving as Christian and Muslim  
worshippers tried to squeeze through the congested alleys. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the Via Dolorosa, stations marked the events of Jesus'  
final walk. Worshippers stopped at each point to read aloud what 
happened, first in Latin, then in English. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli troops with assault rifles were posted along the route.  
The Old City, part of the city sector claimed by the Palestinians 
as a future capital, is traditionally an area of tension. 
</P>
<P>
	The procession ended at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher where  
pilgrims prayed over the marble slab where tradition says Jesus was 
laid after his death. Some were moved to tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel blessed,'' said 70 year-old Mary Lois Mullen from New  
York City. Last year, Mullen's trip to Jerusalem was canceled 
because organizers thought it was too dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	Mullen said she felt safe and was planning to visit the biblical  
West Bank town of Bethlehem in December to attend millennium 
celebrations. ``I figure the Lord won't let harm come to us while 
we are here,'' said Mullen.

<HEADLINE> US Blasts Plan To Try Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration vigorously  
condemned Yugoslav plans to put three captured U.S. soldiers on 
trial, calling for their immediate release or protection from -- as 
prisoners of war -- a military ``kangaroo court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``At a minimum, they are entitled to POW status and the  
protection that that provides under the Geneva Convention,'' 
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Thursday. ``We're outraged by 
that,'' he added of a military proceeding that state-controlled 
Serb television said would begin today. 
</P>
<P>
	As POWS, the Army soldiers captured Wednesday near the  
Macedonia-Yugoslav border -- although it's unclear on which side -- 
could be held until the end of hostilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S.-led NATO bombing campaign continued, meanwhile, and  
U.S. officials confirmed today that B-1 Lancer bombers flew 
missions against Yugoslavia for the first time Thursday night. Air 
Force spokesman Maj. Mark Phillips said two B-1s flew from 
Fairford, England, and returned safely this morning. He had no 
details on their targets. The B-1s arrived at Fairford from the 
United States Thursday to join eight B-52 bombers that have been 
flying Yugoslavia missions since the NATO campaign began. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon was trying to determine whether the soldiers were  
captured in Macedonia or had blundered into Serb territory while on 
the run. Yugoslav authorities said they were caught in Serbia and 
resisted arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	If caught in Macedonia, the soldiers were abducted illegally and  
should be released immediately, Bacon said, echoing President 
Clinton, who said Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic would be 
held responsible for their safety. 
</P>
<P>
	If captured in Serbia, the soldiers should be treated humanely  
as prisoners of war under international law, which prohibits trial 
for anything less than a war crime, Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen called the planned Serb military  
proceeding a ``kangaroo court'' and said it was unclear where it 
might be held or on what charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``There should not be a trial,'' Cohen said Thursday night on  
PBS' ``NewsHour With Jim Lehrer'' program. ``They should be 
entitled to have the Red Cross or some other organization visit 
them. I think it's very clear from the photographs at least one has 
been beaten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav announcement added a new and unsettling element to  
an expanding Balkan conflict. The Clinton administration already is 
under fire from critics who say the NATO air campaign cannot stop 
Serb aggression against ethnic Albanians, and that a humanitarian 
disaster may result. 
</P>
<P>
	Others questioned why the lightly armed U.S. soldiers were  
operating so close to the Yugoslav border. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is incomprehensible to me that the U.S. military would send  
a three-man patrol near the borders of Serbia,'' Sen. Robert 
Torricelli, D-N.J., usually a staunch ally of President Clinton, 
said in a telephone interview. He said the U.S. military had issued 
Yugoslavia a ``virtual invitation'' to capture American soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	To augment a stepped-up NATO bombing campaign against  
Yugoslavia, the Pentagon ordered 13 more F-117A stealth 
fighter-bombers and three cruise-missile-equipped warships to join 
NATO forces that have been hitting Serb military targets since 
March 24 to halt the uprooting and killing of ethnic Albanians in 
Kosovo province. 
</P>
<P>
	The radar-evading F-117s, which this weekend will join 11 in the  
region, can penetrate air defenses for bombing runs deep in enemy 
territory, although one F-117A apparently was shot down by Serb 
anti-aircraft fire last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have made no secret of the fact that the Serb air defenses  
are robust and remain so,'' said Bacon, acknowledging NATO forces 
have had difficulty reaching targets because of air defenses and 
bad weather, although tanks and troops have been hit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy warships -- an attack submarine, destroyer and cruiser  
from the USS Theodore Roosevelt battle group -- were expected to 
arrive in the Adriatic Sea to join the NATO force within days, a 
defense official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Back home, yellow ribbons, a symbol of families waiting for  
soldiers to return from war, decorated hometowns of the three 
soldiers captured Wednesday by Serb forces while on a 
reconnaissance mission along the Macedonian border with the Serb 
province of Kosovo. They were paraded on Serb television, looking 
bruised, scraped and tired but in good health. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steven and those other two soldiers don't deserve this,'' said  
Rosie Gonzales, mother of Spec. Steven Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville, 
Texas. ``They're young men with their whole lives ahead of them who 
were put in a bad situation. We're hopeful for the safe return of 
all three.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzales was captured along with Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez,  
24, of Los Angeles and Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, of 
Smiths Creek, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in contact. We're taking direct fire,'' one of the  
soldiers said, according to a Pentagon-provided text of the team's 
last radio exchange with another Army patrol. 
</P>
<P>
	``You better not be bullshitting me,'' came the reply.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're not,'' the soldier answered. ``We're taking direct fire.  
(interim) We're trapped. (interim) They're all around us. (interim) 
We can't get out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The soldiers, armed lightly with M-16 rifles and traveling in a  
Humvee, had been patrolling with two other 1st Infantry Division 
Army teams, which split up for rough terrain training, Bacon said.

<HEADLINE> Gas Hike Hits California Hard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Angry Californians are digging deeper and  
deeper into their wallets to pay for a gallon of gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't afford these prices when every dollar counts,''  
complained Kristina Whelan, a 19-year-old Spanish literature 
student at the University of California, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It angers me,'' added Robert Sumber, 39, who was filling up a  
car Thursday instead of his gas-guzzling pickup truck. ``You need 
to drive here. What can you do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Californians are paying an average of $1.46 for a gallon of  
regular gas, up from $1.12 just a month ago, said Aileen Bohn, a 
spokeswoman for the Washington-based Energy Information 
Administration. The nationwide average is $1.08 per gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices across the country have jumped since the Organization of  
the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, announced production 
cuts to boost sagging oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's most populous state has been particularly hard hit.  
Fires at two California refineries cut into supplies, and a state 
decision to phase out an additive designed to make gas burn cleaner 
because of safety concerns could be costly. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's a state levy of 18 cents per gallon added to a 7.25  
percent sales tax, some of the highest fees in the nation. 
Motorists already pay 18.4 cents per gallon in federal taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	One California group is calling for government intervention. An  
Internet drive is pushing for a one-day boycott. And drivers are 
voicing their disgust. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the parents are expressing the anger because they are  
now having to decide, make a choice between purchasing gasoline and 
milk,'' said the Rev. Lowe Barry, a community activist. ``Gas is 
nearly $2 a gallon and milk is at least $3.50 a gallon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The anger has surfaced on the Internet, too. A chain e-mail was  
making the rounds of office computer terminals, calling on 
Californians not to buy gas April 30. ``Let's have a GAS OUT!'' it 
read. 
</P>
<P>
	The crisis is not limited to Los Angeles, where mass transit is  
largely a mirage. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Asmann, owner of two Exxon stations in Pleasanton, a city  
of 60,000 in the eastern San Francisco Bay area, raised prices an 
average of 12 cents a gallon Wednesday. Premium was going for 
$1.99.9. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've ordered the number 2 for my signs,'' he said. ``I never  
thought I'd have to use them, but now I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six weeks ago, it was possible to find 99-cent gas in San Jose.  
With the hikes, some stations were selling gas for $1.61 a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will be a long time before we see 99-cent gas  
again,'' said Jerry Cummings, co-owner of a company that owns 
Rotten Robbie stations.

<HEADLINE> Two Romanian Gymnasts Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Two of three Romanian gymnasts who  
disappeared from a Virginia hotel last weekend have surfaced in 
Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	Viorel Popescu and Marian Malita told WESH-TV in Orlando on  
Thursday that they traveled by bus to Orlando after deserting their 
team in Virginia because they wanted to see the United States 
despite their coaches' objections. 
</P>
<P>
	Their teammate, Vasile Cioana, is in New York, the television  
station reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The teammates were last seen on Saturday, the day after their  
team participated in a meet with American and Chinese gymnasts in 
Richmond, Va. The Romanian team left for home Tuesday without them. 
</P>
<P>
	The three gymnasts had temporary visas that allow them to remain  
in the United States for 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Popescu and Malita told WESH that they don't know if they will  
try to stay in the United States or return to Romania, where they 
describe life as ``heavy.'' They currently are staying in Orlando 
in a two-bedroom apartment with three other people. 
</P>
<P>
	If the gymnasts do not return home, it could damage Romania's  
chances of qualifying for the 2000 Olympics. The world 
championships are in October, and the top 12 teams qualify for the 
2000 Games.

<HEADLINE> Crop Insurance Aid Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federally subsidized crop insurance system  
is prone to abuse, conflicts of interest and errors because most of 
the risk for losses is born by taxpayers rather than the private 
companies that sell and service the policies, government auditors 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes the insurance system allows farmers to earn more from  
crops they do not harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies ``have little reason to effectively monitor risky  
policy holders, little reason to deny claims of questionable 
losses, and no cause to find fault with their own practices,'' said 
an internal report by the Agriculture Department's inspector 
general. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to assuming most of the risk for losses, the  
government subsidizes the premiums farmers pay for the insurance 
and pays the companies a fee for handling the policies. The program 
has cost the government more than $1.5 billion a year, and Congress 
is considering doubling that to improve the coverage and make it 
less costly to producers. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said that in west Texas last year, 200 farmers  
obtained federally subsidized insurance on a type of cotton that 
wasn't feasible to grow in their arid region. They paid $4.4 
million in premiums and then claimed nearly $15 million in benefits 
when most of the crop failed. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers in North Dakota and surrounding states recently rushed  
out and bought seed for durum wheat, even in areas not suited for 
the crop, to take advantage of a new insurance policy offering 
benefits far higher than they could earn if they grew and sold 
ordinary wheat, the IG said. 
</P>
<P>
	And in another case cited by the report, sales agents were  
working for tomato farmers to whom they sold insurance. One agent 
received commissions totaling $284,000, and the farmer he worked 
for collected $2.4 million in insurance benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Frerichs, a spokesman for the companies, dismissed the  
inspector general's report this week, saying it was merely 
``rehashing a bunch of old'' audits. 
</P>
<P>
	The insurance companies have to pay some of the losses, with  
their share varying according to their government contracts. 
Nevertheless, they have made $2.8 billion in fees and underwriting 
gains -- their gross profits after losses -- over the last four 
years. That's $400 million more than they made in the previous 14 
years combined. 
</P>
<P>
	Acreage covered by the insurance has doubled to about 70 percent  
of all farmland since the program was last overhauled in 1994, 
while losses have been relatively low. The weather has been good 
through most of the country since 1993 except for droughts in the 
South and Southwest last year that prompted Congress to provide 
$1.7 billion in disaster relief for lost crops and livestock 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA's Risk Management Agency, which oversees the program, has  
been shifting more of the risk to the companies in recent years and 
cutting their fees, officials say. In the case of the durum 
policies, USDA sharply reduced the potential benefits and is now 
being sued by farmers to have them reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Farmers are honest folks. If they think someone is cheating,  
they'll report it,'' said John Zirschky, the agency's associate 
administrator. ``Farmers don't like to see people stealing 
taxpayer's money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The inspector general said the government should consider  
raising the companies' share of the risk still more and take over 
running some of the business. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers currently pay $50 a crop for basic ``catastrophic''  
coverage, regardless of acreage, and about 60 percent of the 
premium -- which can run into thousands of dollars -- for more 
extensive ``buyup'' insurance. Those policies cover losses from 
drought, floods, pests, and in some cases, drops in projected 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	The government pays the rest of the premium. In 1998, the  
government spent $946 million on premium subsidies and paid another 
$759 million to the companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers complain that crop insurance is usually too stingy and  
they want coverage for more specialty crops and also for livestock, 
which can't be insured now.

<HEADLINE> April Storm Pounds Midwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- Plains residents braced for more stormy  
weather today after more than a foot of snow blanketed parts of the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Black Hills in South Dakota, Deadwood got 13 inches of  
snow Thursday and nearby Lead received about a foot. In North 
Dakota, Bismarck and Dickinson both received 9 inches of snow. 
</P>
<P>
	A winter storm watch was still in effect for parts of North  
Dakota, and as much as 6 inches of snow were possible by tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	Snow wasn't the only problem. Wind and freezing rain downed  
power lines in eastern North Dakota, causing outages for as many as 
4,000 customers, said Bonnie Lund, a spokeswoman for Northern 
States Power. 
</P>
<P>
	Crews worked throughout the night and called for reinforcements  
this morning for the Grand Forks area. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been kind of an up-and-down situation,'' NSP spokesman  
Terry Thorstensen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowed, broken tree limbs and branches covered city streets in  
Grand Forks, along with ice and frozen slush. Power was knocked out 
to nine sewer lift stations, and residents were being advised to 
reduce water use and plug basement sewer drains as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	Ice also knocked out a major electrical distribution line  
serving eastern North Dakota and western Minnesota, though back-up 
systems kept power on for most customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm made roads a mess. Melvin Walker was one of many  
truckers stranded at the Stamart Travel Center and Oasis Restaurant 
in Bismarck during Thursday's blizzard. He could only look out a 
truck stop window as he waited for his chance to deliver Washington 
state apples to Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	``You couldn't even see -- freezing rain, snow was blowing. It  
was just terrible,'' the truck driver from Ohio said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kent Kibbel watched the snow from his home in Mott, in  
southwestern North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just holed up,'' he said. ``We can't even see out the  
window. It's not even fit for a dog to be out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The storm couldn't have come at a worse time for ranchers in the  
middle of calving season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can see across the farmstead now and the yard, but that's  
about it,'' said Steve Sprenger, who has about 225 cattle near 
Elgin. ``If you've got any cows that are calving -- if those cows 
aren't in the barn, they're going to be gone.''

<HEADLINE> NATO Ground Campaign Being Examined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The capture of three U.S. soldiers provides a  
stark example of the risks of a ground war in Yugoslavia, but some 
members of Congress and foreign policy analysts see that as the 
only way for NATO to prevail against Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton continues to rule out any tactic involving  
troops, either to take the besieged Kosovo province or to march on 
Belgrade to bring down Milosevic. But both ideas are suggested by 
former officials and military experts as Washington reacts to NATO 
setbacks in the battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton sold Congress on U.S. participation in the NATO attack  
by committing to airstrikes alone, followed by troops only to 
uphold a hoped-for peace agreement between Kosovo's ethnic 
Albanians and Milosevic's government. 
</P>
<P>
	But critics say that while Clinton stressed the risks of any  
campaign, he did not prepare Americans for the extent of ethnic 
cleansing in Kosovo that would occur even under NATO bombardment or 
for the risks posed by NATO attacks on democratic-leaning 
Montenegro, which is part of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	A ground war poses domestic dangers that make it politically  
more difficult for a president to commit troops. Military 
strategists point out that in Yugoslavia it would increase the 
likelihood of casualties as it brings the war to rough terrain 
known well by Serb fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea that it could be more than these three, that you  
could have dozens captured or killed ... could increase political 
pressure for ground intervention,'' says Michael O'Hanlon, foreign 
policy scholar at the Brookings Institution. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could also go the other way,'' he said. ``It raises the  
possibility that people will say this reminds us of how bad things 
could get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Any new course by Clinton likely would be better than current  
strategy, O'Hanlon said, echoing widespread discontent among 
defense and foreign policy analysts with the president's handling 
of the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton admitted in a CBS-TV interview Wednesday that his chief  
concern in sending in ground troops would be ``the prospect of 
never being able to get them out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton sent U.S. peacekeeping forces into neighboring Bosnia in  
late 1995, promising to pull them out in a year. But a third of the 
contingent, more than 6,200 Americans, remains. 
</P>
<P>
	In any scenario for winning the Balkan conflict, analysts say,  
ground troops provide the only way to secure areas now occupied by 
Serb forces and would be needed to protect Kosovar civilians if 
they are to be returned to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	They also would provide a necessary part of any post-bombing  
strategy that aims to oust Milosevic by force -- a goal proponents 
of an all-out campaign say probably is now necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Army Lt. Gen. William E. Odom, senior fellow at the  
Hudson Institute, said Thursday that NATO now must march to 
Belgrade. He added that an exit strategy should never govern a 
victory plan for war. 
</P>
<P>
	``We face the imperative of a ground invasion of Serbia -- not  
just Kosovo,'' Odom said. NATO troops should be prepared, if 
necessary, to stay in Yugoslavia to secure peace until the current 
generation of Serb leaders and their hostilities die of old age, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress remains divided over the NATO action and for the  
advisability of a ground attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Two New York Democrats in the House joined the call for ground  
troops Thursday. Reps. Jerrold Nadler and Eliot Engle urged 
immediate deployment of a NATO force to occupy Kosovo and protect 
ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is now clear, and the Defense Department has admitted, that  
the use of air power alone cannot and will not prevent these 
atrocities,'' they said in a joint statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., said use of troops is not warranted  
until NATO sets clear goals for their use, the threat from Yugoslav 
armored units is ``significantly reduced,'' and there is more 
aggressive bombing of Serb infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Warner, R-Va., who helped push through a Senate vote  
supporting NATO, said Wednesday on the ``NewsHour With Jim Lehrer'' 
a ground assault would take several weeks to organize and that NATO 
should stick to the air campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, of course hindsight may be that you should not have  
abandoned any option in the beginning, put all options in place and 
then determine whether or not to use them,'' he said. But now, he 
said, ``Let's see it through, stick to it.''

<HEADLINE> McDougal Defense Rests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The criminal trial of Whitewater figure  
Susan McDougal is expected to go to the jury early next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense rested Friday after getting an unusual endorsement  
from a woman charged by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's 
prosecutors. Julie Hiatt Steele testified that she, too, was 
indicted because she refused to give false testimony against 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal was indicted on charges of criminal contempt and  
obstruction of justice after she refused to answer federal grand 
jury questions about Clinton and his wife, Hillary, in the 
Whitewater investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	She testified for five days during the month-old trial and  
contended, among other things, that the prosecutor in her 1996 
fraud trial offered her a deal if she would give Starr's office 
something on the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Jahn, who helped prosecute the 1996 case, is expected to  
testify Monday to rebut Mrs. McDougal's testimony. The case could 
go to the jury Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele, who testified Friday against the advice of her  
lawyer, told reporters, ``I came here today because Susan and I 
have both been relentlessly pursued by the Office of Independent 
Counsel. I believe everybody in America needs to know about this, 
and that it could happen to anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele has been charged with lying to grand jurors  
investigating former White House volunteer Kathleen Willey's claim 
that Clinton made an unwelcome sexual advance toward her in 1993. 
Ms. Steele's testimony undercut part of Mrs. Willey's account. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele, 52, of Richmond, Va., told jurors that after  
testifying before two grand juries, she was ``invited to a secret 
meeting at the office of the independent counsel to clarify my 
testimony. I believed I was to support Kathleen Willey's version of 
the story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, she said, ``I couldn't do it. I left the meeting in tears.  
I didn't know anything to tell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele said despite what she considered her minor role in  
the case, which grew out of the Monica Lewinsky investigation, 
prosecutors questioned one of her daughters, her brother, her 
former attorney and her neighbors and friends. Ms. Steele said she 
was upset that some family members also were asked about the 
adoption of her son Adam, now 8, from Romania. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to a prosecutor's questions, Ms. Steele acknowledged  
that she first told a reporter for Newsweek magazine a story that 
supported Willey's account, then recanted. She admitted that within 
days of talking to the reporter, she sold a photograph of Clinton 
and Mrs. Willey to the National Enquirer for $9,000. She said she 
needed the money for her son's special-needs schooling. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the courtroom, McDougal lawyer Mark Geragos contended  
that prosecutors aggressively pursued Ms. Steele even after she 
passed a lie-detector test and Clinton's accuser, Mrs. Willey, 
failed one. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors accepted Mrs. Willey's word ``because they liked her  
story,'' Geragos said. He could not say who administered the 
polygraph tests or offer more detail about the results. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele's attorneys have asserted in court in Virginia that  
polygraph test results undermine the credibility of some 
prosecution witnesses, but they did not elaborate and would not 
comment Friday. Polygraph tests are seldom admissible in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey's lawyer, Daniel Gecker, did not return telephone  
calls seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Whitewater Witness Testifies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Called to bolster Susan McDougal's  
complaints of unfair tactics, another woman indicted by Whitewater 
prosecutors testified today that she was pressured to back up the 
story of a presidential accuser and charged with crimes when she 
refused to lie. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unusual twist, Julie Hiatt Steele took the stand to say  
she was charged with obstruction of justice and making false 
statements after she refused to support the story of Kathleen 
Willey, who said President Clinton made an unwanted sexual advance 
toward her in 1993. Clinton has denied it under oath. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came here today because Susan and I have both been  
relentlessly pursued by the office of independent counsel,'' Ms. 
Steele told reporters after her testimony. ``The people need to 
know this and that it could happen to anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's defense attorney, Mark Geragos, contended  
prosecutors aggressively pursued Ms. Steele even after she passed a 
lie detector test and Clinton's accuser, Mrs. Willey, failed one. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question that she passed a polygraph test, and  
there's no question that Kathleen Willey failed a polygraph test,'' 
Geragos said outside the courtroom. He did not say who administered 
the tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele's attorneys have asserted in court in Alexandria,  
Va., that polygraph test results undermine the credibility of some 
prosecution witnesses, but they did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey's attorney could not be reached immediately for  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Polygraph test results are not ordinarily admissible in court,  
but Mrs. Steele's lawyers could argue they are entitled to use the 
results to call into question the credibility of any Starr witness 
who testifies against her. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele, who goes on trial May 3, testified that she could  
have saved herself $500,000 in legal bills ``by changing my story'' 
to support Mrs. Willey's version of events. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ms. Steele said she had lied about the case once -- to a  
Newsweek reporter investigating the Willey matter -- ``and felt 
horribly guilty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to lie anymore,'' Ms. Steele said under  
questioning by a defense lawyer. She was composed and assertive 
during her two hours on the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey has said she confided in Ms. Steele about the  
Clinton encounter right after it happened. Ms. Steele has testified 
repeatedly that her friend didn't say anything like that to her 
back in 1993 but later asked Ms. Steele to lie to Newsweek and say 
she was told. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors, however, said they have evidence that Ms. Steele  
was told the story in 1993 -- statements by her friends who say she 
shared the tale with them. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Julie Myers asked Ms. Steele whether she had also  
told the story to the National Enquirer and Time magazine. Ms. 
Steele denied selling the story but admitted selling a photograph 
of Mrs. Willey and the president to the publications. She said she 
was embarrassed about it but needed the $9,000 for her son's 
special-needs schooling. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr investigated Mrs. Willey's  
allegation as part of the Monica Lewinsky matter. 
</P>
<P>
	After testifying before two grand juries, Ms. Steele said that  
in November 1998 she was ``invited to a secret meeting at the 
office of the independent counsel to clarify my testimony. I 
believed I was to support Kathleen Willey's version of the story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Were you able to do that? asked defense attorney Mark Geragos.  
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't do it. I left the meeting in tears. I didn't know  
anything,'' she replied. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele was called by attorneys for Mrs. McDougal, who is on  
trial on charges of criminal contempt and obstruction of justice 
for refusing twice to answer federal grand jury questions about the 
Clintons' business dealings. Mrs. McDougal said she feared Starr 
would charge her with perjury if she didn't say what he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge George Howard decided to allow limited  
testimony from Ms. Steele ``to show modus operandi'' of Starr and 
his deputies. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele, who lives in Richmond, Va., said despite what she  
considered her minor role in the case, prosecutors questioned one 
of her daughters, her brother, her former attorney and her 
neighbors and friends. She said a grand jury subpoenaed her 
daughter's boyfriend and even ``asked if he had sex with me.'' The 
judge ordered jurors to disregard that remark. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele said she was upset that some family members also were  
asked about the adoption of her son Adam, now 8, from Romania.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Nazi Guard Returning to Homeland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A man who allegedly guarded 3,700 Jewish  
prisoners shot to death in Nazi-occupied Lithuania agreed today to 
return to his homeland, resolving a government effort to deport 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Vincas Valkavickas, 78, will return to Lithuania in June.  
</P>
<P>
	``He is going voluntarily,'' said defense attorney Gerald  
Venkus. ``He bought his own ticket and nobody is deporting him. He 
wanted to die an American citizen. But since he's being deprived of 
that, he's going back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A federal government complaint last year said Valkavickas was an  
auxiliary policemen who played an essential role in the massacre of 
the Jewish prisoners over two days in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials withdrew that allegation in an agreement  
finalized Friday. The terms also acknowledged Valkavickas failed to 
disclose his police background when he applied for a visa. 
</P>
<P>
	Valkavickas lived and worked as a paint factory worker in the  
United States for nearly 50 years before applying for U.S. 
citizenship in 1997, Venkus said. 
</P>
<P>
	His application caught the attention of the Justice Department's  
Office of Special Investigations, which specializes in finding and 
deporting those with ex-Nazi ties. The office has removed 48 people 
from the United States in the last 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Valkavickas plans to live with a brother in Lithuania.  
</P>
<P>
	``He feels that he has been wronged and doesn't want to live  
here anymore,'' Venkus said.

<HEADLINE> Immigrants Caught in Snowstorm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALPINE, Calif. (AP) -- An overnight snowstorm in a mountainous  
route used by illegal immigrants overtook dozens of people, killing 
at least seven and prompting a major rescue effort for the others. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Border Patrol got a call late Thursday that people were  
stranded in the mountains about 40 miles east of San Diego, said 
Bill Strassberger, spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
	``They tried to cross and a freak snowstorm blew in,''  
Strassberger said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Border Patrol initially found only a few people, but soon  
found other groups of immigrants. By daylight, agents had rescued 
35 and were trying to find 20 others reported missing. Six were 
confirmed dead, Strassberger said, and agents expected the toll to 
grow. Most of the survivors were being taken to hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	The immigrants were all Mexican nationals but were from  
different groups crossing the border illegally, said Border Patrol 
supervisor Roy Villareal, who was at the rescue site this morning. 
At least two were children, sisters between 5 and 7 years old who 
were hospitalized in good condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities were first alerted when a rancher called the Border  
Patrol to say a woman, freezing from the cold, had sought aid late 
Thursday and said her husband and friend were lost. The husband and 
the friend were among those found dead later. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities with the Border Patrol, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S.  
Forest Service, California Highway Patrol and San Diego County 
Sheriff's Department used dogs, helicopters and officers to scour 
the Cleveland National Forest south of Interstate 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers were hampered by slushy trails and low visibility due  
to fog. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a full-scale rescue operation going on,'' Strassberger  
said. ``Anyone available is active and out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the immigrants interviewed today said they were  
abandoned by their smugglers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of their common ploys,'' Villareal said. ``When  
the risk rises, they leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service reported today that up to 16 inches  
of snow fell in the mountains in the past two days and temperatures 
were in the low 30s overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 140 illegal immigrants died last year crossing from  
Mexico into San Diego and Imperial counties. Since 1994, when the 
federal government increased patrols along the border at San Diego, 
migration has pushed to the more treacherous mountains and desert 
east of the city. 
</P>
<P>
	The Border Patrol has asked Mexican officials to warn people  
against crossing the border, especially in bad weather, but the 
warnings aren't effective. An El Nino storm last April left three 
migrants dead and a surprise snow storm in February 1997 claimed 
seven lives, Strassberger said.

<HEADLINE>  Mexicans Stricken By Baseball Fever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) -- The parking lot of Monterrey's baseball  
park was filled with cars, and a line of several thousand people 
snaked around the stadium, then doubled back again. 
</P>
<P>
	But the game -- the season opener between the San Diego Padres  
against the Colorado Rockies -- was more than three days away. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball fever has struck this northern Mexican city, and word  
that an extra 1,000 tickets would go up for sale for Sunday's game 
sparked a scramble like nothing anyone had ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
	The ticket window opened Thursday morning, but Wednesday night  
the line already stretched more than 100 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	By 2 a.m. there were close to 1,000 people waiting, and by  
Thursday morning the parking lot was jammed with fans in cowboy 
hats and baseball caps alike. 
</P>
<P>
	At the front of the line was Leticia Gonzalez, a 43-year-old  
homemaker who said she had been waiting a full 24 hours to buy 
tickets for herself and her three sons, all of whom play in youth 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't go to Colorado to see Vinny (Castilla),'' she said.  
``This is probably the only chance I'll get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For most of the people in line, the extra tickets meant only  
more frustration. The tickets sold out in less than an hour, 
leaving thousands wanting. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundred people jumped up and down on the car of a man  
accused of being a scalper, demanding that he sell them his tickets 
at cost. A half-dozen terrified policemen finally extricated the 
man safely. 
</P>
<P>
	As is the case across much of northern and coastal Mexico,  
baseball is big in Monterrey, an industrial center just a couple of 
hours south of the Texas border. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball had an indisputable dominance here in the 1940s, when  
the Mexican League was flush with money and brought down players 
from the Major Leagues and the Negro Leagues. Roy Campanella played 
for the local Sultans. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past decades, Mexico's television networks have pitched  
soccer and recently have stopped broadcasting Mexican baseball 
games, but in Monterrey baseball continues to be a major sport. 
</P>
<P>
	That allegiance has paid off before with visits by major league  
teams. In 1991 and 1993 U.S. teams played exhibition games in 
Monterrey, and in 1996 the Padres and the Mets staged a three-game 
series here. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents consider Sunday's opening-day game a confirmation of  
their fanaticism -- and many hope it means someday a big league 
franchise could open here as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a question of time and economic stability,'' said  
Hector Bencomo, a Sultans official and baseball commentator on 
local television and radio. ``The fans are ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, in addition to the Sultans, a professional team with one  
of the best stadiums in Mexico, Monterrey has 53 little leagues in 
which thousands of children hope to follow in Castilla's footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997 Monterrey's Guadalupe Linda Vista team of 12-year-olds  
won the Little League World Series, and in 1998 they were the Latin 
American champs. 
</P>
<P>
	On a recent afternoon, the Linda Vista Marlins -- a team in the  
city's Pacifier League -- was practicing for a big game. 
</P>
<P>
	The players, all under 5 years old, struggled with the weight of  
their miniature bats, but some managed to connect and take off 
scrambling toward first base. 
</P>
<P>
	Otilia Lopez, a 30-year-old homemaker, proudly watched from the  
stands as her 4-year-old son, Naoki, stood for batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We bought him his batting cage. We bought him four gloves and  
a lot of baseballs,'' she said. ``So of course we're going to take 
him to see the game.''

<HEADLINE> Three Teen-Agers Gunned Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEE TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- Peggy Baker heard a scream and then  
her neighbor rushed over to use her phone. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said, `I think my children are dead,''' Ms. Baker said  
Friday, a day after two of Pat and Eugene Sherrell's children and 
another teen-ager were killed in the family's rural mobile home. 
``I called 911 because the mother was too shook up. ... There was 
blood all over her hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Darla Sherrell, 17, Dustin Sherrell, 16, and a family friend,  
17-year-old Jonathan Edwards, were shot execution-style in the head 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The three victims and another teen-ager, Jamasa Derring, were  
spending the night at the home while on spring break, parents told 
police. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they believe at least two people were involved in  
the killing. Authorities said they were searching for Derring, but 
they did not characterize him as a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the last person seen with the victims,'' said County  
Sheriff's Lt. Rick Cain said. 
</P>
<P>
	No murder weapon has been found, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The parents discovered the bodies when they returned from work.  
Police said the two boys were in a bedroom as if sleeping. The girl 
was in a living room chair. All were fully dressed and there was no 
sign of forced entry or robbery. 
</P>
<P>
	Cain said authorities are optimistic they will solve the case.  
But answers can't come quickly enough in this town of 2,672 about 
30 miles south of Grand Rapids. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Edwards' mother, Judith Taylor, of Quincy, about 50  
miles to the southeast, stood weeping in front of the Sherrell's 
mobile home Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	She last saw her son Tuesday, when he told her he was going to  
visit the Sherrells. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he would be home for Easter,'' Ms. Taylor said,  
sobbing as she described the 1-year-old daughter her son leaves 
behind. ``I can't believe this happened. ... I just feel numb.''

<P>
	As usual, some will forget and show up an hour late for work,  
church on Easter Sunday or other events.

	A few places exempt themselves from daylight-saving time:  
Arizona, Hawaii, the part of Indiana in the Eastern time zone, 
Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and American Samoa.

<HEADLINE> Bogus Web Charges Are Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH (AP) -- Wayne Holbrook, owner of Welcome Bait &AMP; Tackle in  
xford, was perplexed and annoyed when he saw a $24.95 charge on his 
phone bill for a Web site created for his business. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrook has never even seen a computer operate, much less  
surfed the Internet, and he never had heard of the small Texas 
company whose name appeared on his bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I called them, and they said, `You ordered it.' Then I  
called the telephone company, and they said there was nothing they 
could do,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrook may have been a victim of a new scam called ``Web  
cramming'' that has aggravated small business owners across North 
Carolina in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	The N.C. Attorney General's Office is planning a crackdown.  
</P>
<P>
	``Companies shouldn't bill consumers for Web-page services that  
they did not order and do not want,'' Attorney General Mike Easley 
said. ``My office has taken action against some of these companies, 
and we plan to take further action in order to stamp out this 
problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In February, the attorney general's consumer complaints division  
fielded 19 complaints from companies claiming they were charged for 
Web sites they didn't order or for sites they had canceled after a 
one-month free trial. Similar numbers are expected for March, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Easley's office began tracking Web-cramming complaints late last  
year. Several out-of-state companies are being investigated, but no 
legal action has been taken. 
</P>
<P>
	Cramming is a charge on a phone bill for a service that wasn't  
ordered. The problem escalated after the 1996 Telecommunications 
Act opened phone markets to thousands of new companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Typically, cramming occurs when companies that consolidate  
various charges on a phone bill under an agreement with the local 
phone company are involved, officials said. The cramming charges 
usually appear on a separate page in the bill and may reflect 
services such as paging or 900 calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrook said he got stuck with his Web site after a  
telemarketer contacted his 13-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
	The company offered free service for a month and promised to  
send papers allowing Welcome Bait &AMP; Tackle to cancel the deal after 
a month, Holbrook said. Those papers never arrived, he said, but he 
was billed anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrook said he has no idea what the Web site looked like.  
</P>
<P>
	After two months, his phone company, Sprint, finally agreed to  
remove the charges from his bill. But the telemarketers haven't 
given up, Holbrook said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting calls every week,'' he said. ``When they say  
Internet and Web site, I just hang up.''

<HEADLINE> Orioles Put Chris Hoiles on Waivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles gave up Friday on Chris  
Hoiles, the catcher whose career was hurt by injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles said they will ask waivers on him Monday for the  
purpose of giving him his unconditional release. The 34-year-old 
Hoiles was offered another job within the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoiles was guaranteed $3.7 million this season in the final year  
of a five-year deal. He concludes his Orioles career in ninth place 
on the team's career list with 151 homers and eighth with a .467 
slugging percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	``In all my years in baseball, this was singularly the toughest  
thing I have had to do,'' Orioles manager Ray Miller said. ``It is 
my sincere hope that Chris stays with the Orioles because the goal 
of every organization is to surround itself with quality people. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chris Hoiles is one of the most professional players and  
classiest men that I have ever had the honor of being associated 
with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoiles hit .262 with 15 home runs and 56 RBIs in 267 at-bats  
last season. He caught in 83 games. 
</P>
<P>
	With his hip and lower back unable to withstand the rigors of  
catching, Hoiles hoped to remain with the team as a first baseman 
and designated hitter. But the Orioles have Will Clark at first 
base and are expected to use Willis Otanez as their right-handed 
DH. 
</P>
<P>
	Otanez is out of options and would have to clear waivers if  
assigned to the minor leagues. He is nine years younger than Hoiles 
and had 104 RBIs with Triple-A Rochester last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoiles' finest year came in 1993 when he batted .310 in 126  
games with 28 doubles, 29 homers and 82 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Last August, Hoiles became the ninth major leaguer to hit two  
grand slams in a single game, performing the feat at Jacobs Field 
in Cleveland.

	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Leon Stukelj, at 101 the oldest living  
Olympic gold medal winner, hopes to return to Athens in five years 
for the Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would love to come back in 2004,'' said Stukelj, a former  
gymnast from Slovenia who is still active. 
</P>
<P>
	Stukelj, born two years after the first modern Olympics in 1896,  
won six Olympic medals, including two golds in the 1924 Paris Games 
and another gold in the 1928 Amsterdam Games. He won another 14 
medals in international events before retiring after the Berlin 
Olympics in 1936. 
</P>
<P>
	``The medals give me great joy when I look at them because I  
know no one can take them from me, and that was a big 
achievement,'' he said after visiting the Acropolis. 
</P>
<P>
	His three-day trip to Athens included meetings with Greece's  
president, the culture minister and a visit to the all-marble 
Panathenian Stadium, where the first modern Olympics were held.

<HEADLINE> Gore Campaign Focuses on Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore's presidential bid should be helped by  
the strong economy and the public's generally favorable view of 
Democratic positions on domestic issues. But polls suggest he needs 
to show he's a strong leader and a compelling candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president's advisers are developing a two-pronged  
strategy to address the problems: to let Gore tell his personal 
story to voters, and to project him as a leader separate from 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	They've started on the first chore, but the job of  
differentiating Gore from his boss is trickier given Clinton's 
identification with popular policies at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior Gore advisers say privately that aides are debating how  
to make him look more presidential and how far in advance of the 
2000 election they have to start. Some suggest this be done soon to 
soothe supporters in light of Texas Republican Gov. George W. 
Bush's advantage in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	They've been testing some approaches such as Gore's small-scale  
initiatives to improve the quality of American life in areas such 
as traffic jams and clean drinking water. He's also said he would 
expand on Clinton education initiatives by limiting class sizes and 
providing preschool programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vice presidents have the strategic problem of trying to  
separate themselves as independent of the person they've served 
with,'' said Charles Jones, a presidential scholar, retired from 
the University of Wisconsin who has been teaching in Oxford, 
England. ``President Clinton has tried to use him more as a 
counselor, but the things Gore has been in charge of are not 
exactly sexy. Reinventing government is not the kind of thing you'd 
see on a bumper sticker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Publicly, Gore aides dismiss head-to-head matchups that show  
Gore trailing Republicans like Bush and former Red Cross President 
Elizabeth Dole in the 2000 campaign. The aides contend Bush and 
Mrs. Dole two have easily recognizable names but have few public 
positions on the issues. Gore has a double-digit lead over former 
New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley in the race for the Democratic 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Some voters think Gore will do fine, given time to explain his  
candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Annetta Giesmann, 80, of Sterling, Neb., voted for Ronald Reagan  
in the 1980s but thinks Gore would make a good president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he would carry on what President Clinton has done, and  
the country's in good shape,'' she said. ``He's been vice 
president, and vice presidents never do much. Give him a year, and 
he'll come across with his ideas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Gore campaign's strategy to connect their candidate with the  
voters is to share more about his personal background before his 
service in the Clinton administration. He now explains he's been a 
farm worker, journalist, businessman and Vietnam veteran. 
</P>
<P>
	But changing the public perception of Gore may be tough.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if he's got the spunk,'' said Alvin Watson, 42, a  
machine operator from Saratoga, N.Y., and lifelong Democrat. ``He 
doesn't look like the type of guy that's like an everyday person. 
He looks very strict, a little stiff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The circumstances should be ripe for a Gore candidacy. A  
February poll by the Pew Research Center for the People &AMP; the Press 
and an ABC/Washington Post poll taken in mid-March said a majority 
wanted the country to continue in the policy direction charted by 
the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	About two-thirds of Americans said in the ABC/Post poll they  
approved of Gore's character, and more than half said he has a 
vision for the future. But he lagged 27 percentage points behind 
Bush as a strong leader in the ABC/Post poll. In the Pew poll taken 
in February, almost half said there was no chance they would vote 
for him, while about a fourth of respondents said there was no 
chance they would vote for Bush or Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore says he will campaign ``door-to-door, family-to-family and  
one-on-one'' in Iowa and New Hampshire. Aides are working to get 
biographical profiles of Gore published in newspapers and 
magazines. They've counseled him to cut back on the jokes about his 
straight-faced demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanderbilt University presidential scholar Erwin Hargrove said,  
``Gore has difficulty projecting warmth, which he does have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore political adviser Robert Squier said it isn't easy for the  
candidate to talk about himself in public and adds that all vice 
presidents have to define themselves as separate from the 
administrations they've served. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a process he's going through,'' Squier said. ``A very  
shy man is learning how to share himself with strangers.''

<HEADLINE> Hawks 84, Grizzlies 81 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Dikembo Mutombo scored a season-high 24 points  
and grabbed 15 rebounds and Tyrone Corbin hit two key 3-pointers as 
the Atlanta Hawks held off the Vancouver Grizzlies 84-81 Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Atlanta's sixth victory in eight games. The Grizzlies  
lost their seventh in eight and 20th in 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Corbin's 3-pointers came after the Hawks had gone scoreless for  
5:46 in the third, allowing Vancouver to build a 55-46 lead on Mike 
Bibby's 18-footer with 4:09 left in the quarter. Corbin cut the 
lead to 57-52 with his two baskets and the Hawks eventually gained 
a tie at 64 on Grant Long's layup with 7:10 to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Bibby's fastbreak layup off an Atlanta turnover gave the  
Grizzlies a 70-68 lead with 4:10 to play, but Anthony Johnson tied 
it on a runner in the lane with 3:48 to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson missed a free throw that would have given the Hawks the  
lead, but Mutombo grabbed the rebound and the Grizzlies were called 
for their second illegal defense of the night. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson shot the technical, putting the Hawks ahead to stay,  
71-70 with 3:36 to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareef Abdur-Rahim led Vancouver with 24 points and Bibby added  
20. 
</P>
<P>
	Corbin and Long each scored 14 off the bench for the Hawks, who  
snapped a two-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The Hawks placed Steve Smith on the injured list because of  
a sprained left knee, saying he could be out of action 7-10 days. 
Smith missed six games earlier in the season with a strained right 
knee. ... The Grizzlies signed Terry Dehere to a second 10-day 
contract. ... The victory lifted the Hawks record against Vancouver 
to 7-0. ... It was Vancouver's 13th loss in a row on the road, 
where they are 1-14 this season.

<HEADLINE> Virus Underground Split By Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The close-knit underground of computer virus  
creators split into two camps at the news that one of their own may 
have been arrested for releasing malicious Melissa. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole community has really been shaken up by this,'' said  
B.K. Delong, who follows the virus scene. ``The first group is one 
that wants a better reputation. Then there's the community that 
wants to retaliate and come up with even more destructive 
viruses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Virus creators gather at the Virus Exchange Underground, a  
computer chat area where they swap ideas and gossip. Most are 
programmers interested in viruses and computer bugs. They often 
write viruses and swap them among themselves, Delong said. 
</P>
<P>
	They refer to themselves as ``Black Hats,'' interested in doing  
damage, and ``White Hats,'' often crack programmers looking for 
possible security hazards. The Black Hats sometimes release viruses 
through e-mail or Usenet newsgroups. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement released on behalf of the VX Underground, as it's  
often called, the group warned the media and investigators not to 
quickly condemn the author of Melissa. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead they should be more interested in the person who  
released the bug which caused the spread of the virus,'' said the 
statement, which was e-mailed to The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Melissa was originally posted on two sex discussion groups a  
week ago Friday, according to an online search. The VX Underground 
said it was highly unlikely those two posts out of thousands could 
have led to Melissa's vicious cascade. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, once released others posted the Melissa source code  
to additional newsgroups, Web sites and listservs (mailing lists), 
which meant anyone could turn it into the virus and continue to 
spread it,'' the statement continued. 
</P>
<P>
	David L. Smith, 30, of Aberdeen, N.J., was arrested Friday and  
charged with originating the destructive Melissa, which infected 
hundreds of thousands of computers and swamped hundreds of 
companies' e-mail systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer experts used unique identification numbers embedded in  
Microsoft Word documents to trace Melissa back to a well-known 
virus writer who calls himself VicodinES. 
</P>
<P>
	Rita Malley, spokeswoman for the New Jersey state attorney  
general's office said Smith was ``definitely not'' the person known 
by that handle. Instead, Smith took two viruses, one of which came 
from VicodinES, and combined them with another virus to create 
Melissa, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They (the Black Hat programmers) are looking for someone to  
blame,'' said Delong. They resent the treatment VicodinES 
supposedly received at the hands of the media, and they're rallying 
around their own. They said he is a really nice guy.''

<HEADLINE> Adventure Magazine Set To Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The venerable National Geographic Society is  
moving to widen its appeal with a new magazine, National Geographic 
Adventure. 
</P>
<P>
	Scheduled to hit the newsstands Tuesday, Adventure becomes the  
fourth magazine in the society's 111-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	It's aimed at ``an active, young, hands-on audience that wants  
to get out and have these great adventures for themselves,'' said 
editor John Rasmus, who formerly edited Outside magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``We understand that people don't necessarily aspire to do  
everything within our pages,'' he acknowledged, but added that 
``people love to read about adventure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its first issue, Adventure profiles seven famous explorers,  
including oceanographer Sylvia Earle, cave explorer Louise Hose and 
dinosaur-digger Paul Sereno. 
</P>
<P>
	It includes a feature on free climbing in Greenland; a look at  
Robert Ballard, finder of the Titanic; stories of two treks down a 
deep gorge in the Himalayas; a look at the safety of gorilla 
watching in Uganda; and a story about two 19th century fur trappers 
written by Sebastian Junger, author of ``The Perfect Storm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new magazine will sell for $3.95 in the United States and $5  
in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	It joins the National Geographic magazine, currently issued in  
English and several foreign languages. The society also publishes 
National Geographic Traveler, a more traditional travel magazine, 
and National Geographic World for children.

<P>
	A storm system continued Friday over the Plains and Rockies,  
where cold temperatures and high winds combined to create 
below-zero wind chill factors in areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The heaviest snow fell across the mountains of Colorado and  
Wyoming by Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	In the middle of Wyoming, Casper received 14 inches and Lander  
had 2 feet of snow since the storm began Thursday. Sinks Canyon, 
eight miles southwest of Lander, had 31 inches. In Colorado, 
Evergreen received 10 inches of snow and Hot Sulphur Springs picked 
up 9 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	Winds between 15 and 30 mph were associated with the storm. Wind  
gusts up to 45 mph made it feel like 27 below zero in Rock Springs, 
Wyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials closed schools, canceled flights and warned against  
unnecessary travel in parts of the central Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	Snowfall was lighter in Arizona, New Mexico, the northern  
Rockies and northern Plains. Hundreds of North Dakotans remained 
without power late Friday afternoon as the state cleaned up from 
heavy snowfall Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures ranged no higher than the 40s for most of the area  
Friday. Winds ahead of the storm helped push temperatures from Iowa 
to Texas into the 60s and 70s. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides a few showers riding along the Mississippi River into  
far western areas of the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes, most of the 
rest of the nation was under fair and dry weather. 
</P>
<P>
	The morning low for the Lower 48 was 4 degrees in Yellowstone  
National Park, Wyo., while the afternoon high of 85 was recorded in 
Harlingen, Texas.

<HEADLINE>  Military Jury Says To Dismiss Marine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A military jury on Friday recommended  
dismissal from the Marine Corps for a navigator who admitted 
destroying a personal videotape he made before his jet cut an 
Italian ski gondola cable, killing 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine-man panel of Marine officers deliberated 3 1/2 hours  
Friday before recommending the punishment for Capt. Joseph 
Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer sat stoically and the courtroom was silent as the  
judge, Col. Alvin Keller, imposed the recommended sentence. But 
after court adjourned, Schweitzer smiled at his lawyers and nodded 
his head. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer pleaded guilty Monday to obstruction of justice and  
conspiracy for destroying the tape after his EA-6B Prowler hit the 
cable over Cavalese, Italy, on Feb. 3, 1998. The ski gondola 
plunged 370 feet into a valley. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge had the option of sentencing Schweitzer to a  
previously undisclosed punishment recommended as part of 
Schweitzer's guilty plea, or to accept the jury's recommendation -- 
whichever is more lenient. 
</P>
<P>
	He chose the jury's recommendation. The sentence proposed in the  
plea agreement, divulged after the jury made its recommendation, 
called for forfeiture of pay and allowance and dismissal from the 
Marine Corps. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentence doesn't take effect until it is approved by Lt.  
Gen. Peter Pace, who convened the court-martial. Pace, commander of 
Marine Forces Atlantic in Norfolk, Va., may approve the sentence or 
recommend a lighter one. Schweitzer then could choose to pursue his 
decision through the military appeals process. 
</P>
<P>
	A prosecutor, Maj. Stu Couch, urged the jury earlier Friday to  
recommend Schweitzer's dismissal from the service and prison, but 
said the government didn't wish to see him sentenced to the maximum 
10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is this a character flaw or just a crime?'' Couch asked.  
``Everybody trusted him. ... That makes the perfect conspirator, 
somebody who has that amount of trust built up over a period of 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Dave Beck said the harshest punishment should  
be a letter of reprimand. 
</P>
<P>
	``Capt. Schweitzer has got to get up every day and know his  
career in the Marine Corps is over,'' Beck said. ``This good and 
faithful Marine, this outstanding Marine officer made some bad 
decisions over a three- to five-day period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beck reminded the jurors that Schweitzer ``looked you in the  
eye. ... He told you things that nobody had any way of knowing 
until he came forward to tell the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couch said the tape so worried Schweitzer and the pilot, Capt.  
Richard Ashby, that they stayed in the cockpit after making an 
emergency landing at the Aviano, Italy, air base to swap the tape 
for a blank one. Schweitzer said he later tossed the cassette into 
a bonfire. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's the one thing on his mind?'' Couch asked. ``That tape.  
That tape was stressing him out ... driving him nuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer testified Thursday that he stopped taping 10 minutes  
before the jet severed the cable, but said he smiled once into the 
camera and feared the image would be used in media reports of the 
tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	He described his destruction of the tape as the biggest mistake  
of his life and said he wanted to die after learning people in the 
gondola had been killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Involuntary manslaughter charges against Schweitzer were dropped  
after Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., was acquitted last month 
of the same charges. Ashby still faces the two obstruction charges 
and his trial is scheduled April 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Two back seat crewmen in the radar-jamming aircraft were charged  
after the accident, but the charges were dismissed last year.

<HEADLINE> Woman Charged in Killing Newborn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HIALEAH, Fla. (AP) -- A woman at a state-licensed home for adults  
with mental and physical disabilities heard her newborn cry before 
she tried to flush him down the toilet, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daisy McFadden, 34, was charged today with first-degree murder a  
day after her son was found in the toilet at Adam Home, an 
assisted-living community just northwest of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	An employee had noticed a trail of blood and followed it to Ms.  
McFadden's room, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees at the home were aware that Ms. McFadden was pregnant,  
said Lt. Jerry Freeman. He said he had no information about the 
identity of the baby's father. 
</P>
<P>
	The medical examiner concluded that the baby was alive when born  
and died as a result of being submerged in the water. He was 
between 32 weeks and 34 weeks old and weighed only 4.2 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ms. McFadden had told people the baby cried after it was born  
and before it went in the water,'' said Lt. Jerry Freeman. ``The 
baby showed some trauma to the head. There was some evidence that 
suggested she may have had it on the toilet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. McFadden's roommate, who was sleeping during the birth, also  
said she heard the baby cry, Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman said he did not know the specifics of Ms. McFadden's  
disability, who was recovering at a nearby hospital. She was 
expected to be transferred to a hospital detention area under 
control of state prison officials. She also will undergo a mental 
evaluation, Freeman said.

<HEADLINE> Baffert Tries for Another 1-2 Finish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Because Aaron Jones listened to Bob  
Baffert, he has his first Santa Anita Derby starter and a possible 
serious Kentucky Derby contender in Prime Timber. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Baffert didn't listen to his 12-year-old son, Tyler, he  
is the trainer, but not the owner, of Prime Timber, who will try to 
give Baffert his second straight Santa Anita Derby victory, then 
try for an unprecedented third consecutive win for Baffert in the 
Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Baffert recalled a telephone conversation with Jones  
that led to Florida-bred Prime Timber being bought for $375,000 as 
a 2-year-old at the 1998 Ocala Sale. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Jones, we've got to buy this thing,'' Baffert said. ``He's  
unbelievable. He reminds me of Silver Charm (second in the Santa 
Anita Derby and winner of the Kentucky Derby in 1997).'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 77-year-old Jones, in the lumber business in Oregon and a  
racehorse owner for nearly 30 years, admitted Friday that he was 
reluctant at first. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has no pedigree,'' Jones told Baffert. The colt is by  
Sultry Song out of the Nodouble mare Wine Taster. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's OK, he can run,'' Baffert replied.  
</P>
<P>
	After Baffert hung up with Jones, his son, who had been  
listening, said, ``Why are you buying it for him, buy it for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Timber, ridden by David Flores, probably will be the  
post-time favorite for the 1 1/8-mile Santa Anita Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	In his last start, the colt, wearing blinkers for the first  
time, won the 1 1-16-mile San Felipe March 13. That was his first 
win in two starts as a 3-year-old and his third victory in five 
career races. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his two seconds came in his 3-year-old debut when, racing  
wide throughout, he was runner-up by a neck to Santa Anita Derby 
contender Desert Hero in the one-mile San Rafael Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert will not only be seeking his third Santa Anita Derby  
victory -- his first was in 1996 with Cavonnier, the Kentucky Derby 
runner-up -- he also will be trying for a second straight 1-2 
finish. He got that last year with Indian Charlie and Real Quiet. 
The latter won the Kentucky Derby, with Indian Charlie third. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert's other Santa Anita Derby starter and Kentucky Derby  
hopeful is General Challenge, a California-bred gelding, ridden by 
Gary Stevens and owned by John and Betty Mabee. 
</P>
<P>
	General Challenge, who won his only two starts last year and  
also his 3-year-old debut, finished fifth in his last start, the 1 
1-16-mile Louisiana Derby March 14. He will race with blinkers for 
the first time Saturday. He wore them for the first time when he 
worked five-eighths of a mile in 57 3-5 seconds March 23 at Santa 
Anita. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel as confident going into this race as I did last year,  
and it's a tougher race this year,'' Baffert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the opposition that his pair will face, Baffert noted Desert  
Hero and the filly Honest Lady. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the field for the $750,000 race are Capsized, Hire Wire  
Act, Charismatic and Walk That Walk. 
</P>
<P>
	Desert Hero, a son of 1993 Kentucky Derby winner Sea Hero, is  
ridden by Corey Nakatani and owned by Prince Ahmed bin Salman of 
Saudi Arabia. He did not race as a 2-year-old, making his debut 
with a victory Feb. 7 at Santa Anita, then winning the San Rafael. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Desert Hero wins this race, he's a super horse,'' Baffert  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Honest Lady, Baffert said, ``Bobby Frankel wouldn't let  
her in if he didn't think she had a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Frankel said Honest Lady has to win Saturday to earn a  
shot at the Kentucky Derby or if she doesn't win, ``I would think 
she would have to have a big excuse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Honest Lady, ridden by Kent Desormeaux and owned by Prince  
Khalid Abdullah, also of Saudi Arabia, won her first two starts, 
then made her debut against colts in the San Rafael. She finished 
fifth, but only one length behind winner Desert Hero. 
</P>
<P>
	Honest Lady will carry 115 pounds to 120 for each of the other  
starters. Three fillies have won the race -- Ciencia (1939), Silver 
Spoon (1959) and Winning Colors (1988). Winning Colors also was the 
third, and last, filly to win the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Capsized, third in the San Rafael, is trained by Lisa Lewis,  
only the fifth woman to saddle a horse for the Santa Anita Derby. 
None has won.

<HEADLINE> FCC Questions SBC-Ameritech Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A proposed merger that would create the  
nation's largest local phone company is causing ``serious 
concerns'' for the government's top telecommunications regulator. 
</P>
<P>
	In letters Thursday to the chiefs of SBC Communications and  
Ameritech Corp., Bill Kennard, chairman of the Federal 
Communications Commission, questioned whether their union would 
serve the public interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Given that, Kennard said he wants the companies and commission  
staff to begin discussions this month to explore ``whether it would 
be possible to craft conditions'' addressing his concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not elaborate on what those conditions should be, but  
said he wanted the discussions to conclude by late June. The FCC 
could rule on the merger sometime thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed $57 billion merger, which was cleared by the  
Justice Department last month, would create the nation's largest 
local phone company, spread across 13 states. 
</P>
<P>
	By law, the FCC must review proposed mergers to determine  
whether they will serve the public interest -- a broad legal 
standard. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this stage I have serious concerns about whether your  
proposal satisfies this requirement,'' Kennard said in letters to 
SBC Chairman Edward Whitacre Jr. and Ameritech Chairman Richard 
Notebaert. 
</P>
<P>
	Ameritech spokeswoman Lisa Kim responded: ``This is an  
opportunity to put forth the many benefits of this pro-competition, 
pro-consumer merger.'' She said Ameritech believed the FCC would 
approve the deal. SBC declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, Kennard asked how the commission can be  
assured that the merger ``will not interfere with the companies' 
willingness and ability'' to open their local phone markets to 
other companies that want to provide competing local phone and 
other communications services. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard also wanted to know how the FCC can be assured that the  
public will receive the benefits the companies say will result from 
the union. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, Kennard was referring to the companies' claim that  
they need to combine to provide local phone and other services in 
30 targeted markets outside their combined 13-state local region. 
Such a move would have SBC-Ameritech competing against fellow Bell 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies say they will become more efficient and  
financially able to invade markets outside their region, which they 
contend they cannot do separately. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard also asked how they can assure the commission that the  
merger will improve ``overall consumer welfare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Kagan, a telecommunications analyst based in Atlanta,  
continues to believe the FCC will approve the merger. ``The FCC 
basically wants to be convinced the companies will do what they 
promised,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups, meanwhile, want the FCC to block the deal,  
contending it would thwart local phone competition and the prospect 
of lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T welcomed Kennard's letters, but called the merger ``so  
anticompetitive that there are serious questions as to whether it 
can be `fixed' with conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 13 states in the proposed merger are Arkansas, California,  
Connecticut, Kansas, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, Illinois, 
Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Finish Mixed / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen today and a top  
official of Japan's Finance Ministry renewed pressure against the 
Japanese currency's rise. Japanese stocks turned mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.66 yen in the late afternoon, up 2.14 yen  
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level 
of 120.43 overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 37.37 points, or 0.23  
percent, closing the week at 16,290.19 points. On Thursday, the 
average advanced 490.97 points, or 3.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar moved higher against the yen on  
good buying by U.S. banks at around 120.50 yen, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The greenback's strength also derived from remarks by Haruhiko  
Kuroda, a senior official at Japan's Finance Ministry, who 
reiterated the ministry's stance that excessive yen strength is 
undesirable. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuroda, director-general of the ministry's international bureau,  
spoke to a small group of reporters without specifying an 
appropriate level for the currency. 
</P>
<P>
	A higher yen tends to make Japanese exports more expenses  
aboard, and thus less competitive, cutting into earnings of 
export-oriented Japanese companies. Japan is struggling to bail 
itself out of its worst recessions since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade remained thin ahead of the weekend and holidays in Europe  
and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 120.41 yen and 120.88 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro was traded at 130.02 yen, up from 128.42 yen  
late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, export-oriented blue chips were among  
today's gainers, while some investors took profits by selling 
issues of other companies, including banks and telecommunications, 
which have recently led the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices were also hurt by lethargic trade as many foreign  
investors were away for the Easter holidays and because dealers 
remained reluctant to take positions before Monday's announcement 
of the Bank of Japan's quarterly ``tankan'' survey of business 
sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was fairly active, with about 614 million shares  
changing hands on the exchange's first section, compared with 
Thursday's turnover of 726 million shares. Declines outnumbered 
advancers 614 to 601, with 108 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section gained 3.73 points, or 0.29 percent, to 1,304.17. The 
TOPIX rose 33.22 points, or 2.6 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which marked the 50th  
anniversary of its founding on Thursday, held a small ceremony 
today morning at the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at the ceremony, Bank of Japan Governor Masaru Hayami  
said that the central bank is maintaining a very easy monetary 
stance to help support the nation's struggling economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 211 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.740 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.720 percent, 
driving its price down to 100.51 yen from 100.69 yen.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Removes Prosecutor, Tycoon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin resumed his offensive  
against Russia's prosecutor-general on Friday, suspending him from 
his post just as a corruption probe into the Kremlin was gathering 
momentum. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin also won backing from his colleagues in the Commonwealth  
of Independent States to fire tycoon Boris Berezovsky as executive 
secretary of the CIS, an alliance of 12 former Soviet republics. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the prosecutor and the businessman stained Yeltsin's  
reputation, Berezovsky by apparently using Kremlin connections to 
pursue his business interests, and Prosecutor-General Yuri Skuratov 
by accusing Yeltsin of ignoring the alleged corruption of his inner 
circle. 
</P>
<P>
	But Yeltsin insisted the ousters were justified. He said  
Berezovsky had meddled in government affairs. As for Skuratov, 
Yeltsin said in a letter Friday to the upper house of parliament 
that the prosecutor was facing criminal charges that hobbled his 
office's work. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin wrote an order Friday suspending Skuratov from office  
while he is investigated on charges of abuse of power. The 
president ordered Skuratov's office sealed and his phone line to 
the Kremlin cut. 
</P>
<P>
	The speaker of the upper chamber, Yegor Stroyev, said he and his  
colleagues would have to ``thoroughly study'' Skuratov's case 
before coming to a decision, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. 
The upper house is the only body that can dismiss Skuratov. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin's opponents accused the president of trying to block the  
prosecutor's investigation into alleged Kremlin corruption. 
Skuratov's office has been probing alleged bribe-taking by Russian 
officials and investigating Russian funds believed to have been 
illegally deposited in Swiss banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin pressured Skuratov to resign in February. But the upper  
house refused to back the president, and Skuratov withdrew his 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	When Skuratov returned to work, Russian state television aired  
segments of a video apparently showing Skuratov having sex with two 
prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of Russia's Federal Security Service, Vladimir Putin,  
alleged Friday that criminal suspects had provided Skuratov with 
the girls as encouragement to drop investigations against them. 
</P>
<P>
	Berezovsky had also tried to resist Yeltsin's effort to fire  
him, but the CIS heads of state on Friday heeded the president's 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Berezovsky wanted to defend himself, but could not get  
permission for his plane to enter Russian airspace. He had been in 
France, and after being unable to reach Moscow, he went to the 
Ukrainian capital Kiev. 
</P>
<P>
	Berezovsky has been a powerful player in Russian politics for  
years, thanks to close links with Yeltsin's inner circle. But he 
has fallen out of favor in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian prosecutors have opened a probe against him on charges  
of setting up an illegal bugging network to eavesdrop on government 
officials. They have also investigated his business activities.

<HEADLINE> Twins Held in Family Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KITTRELL, N.C. (AP) -- Twin 11-year-old brothers were charged  
today with shooting their father to death as he bounded up a 
staircase after hearing the sound of bullets hitting his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys, whose names were not released by Vance County  
investigators, then allegedly shot their 16-year-old sister and 
waited for police to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a terrible, bloody mess. There was a lot of blood all  
through the house,'' sheriff's Capt. John C. Shockley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The twins face juvenile charges of murder and two counts each of  
assault with a deadly weapon. A juvenile court hearing is scheduled 
for Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both were equally responsible. Both were equally involved,''  
Shockley said. He said the boys were being held Friday in separate 
juvenile centers. 
</P>
<P>
	Shockley said investigators didn't know what set off the  
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	William Harvey Bawcum Jr., 46, died at the scene Thursday night  
after being shot in the right cheek and throat at the family home 
35 miles north of Raleigh, Shockley said. A .32-caliber handgun 
that was recovered is believed to be the murder weapon, Shockley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bawcum's wife, Deborah, 45, and daughter Robin were taken to  
Duke University Medical Center in Durham with gunshot wounds. Robin 
was in fair condition and her mother was in good condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``All little boys are mischievous. But these boys you'd never  
imagine would shoot somebody,'' said Darlynn Oxendine, a family 
friend and a physical education teacher who was Robin's basketball 
and volleyball coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Bawcum was shot first in an upstairs bedroom, Shockley  
said. Her husband was fatally wounded as he ran upstairs from the 
living room, he said. Robin Bawcum was shot next. 
</P>
<P>
	Oxendine said Mrs. Bawcum kept saying, ``He came up to save  
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shockley said one of the Bawcums called 911. Police were unsure  
who. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Bawcum told investigators the boys have had problems at  
school, Shockley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors said Bawcum, a telephone company technician, was an  
avid hunter and fishermen, and the boys practiced with BB guns on 
the family's thickly wooded lot. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's were they learned to use guns,'' said Oxendine.

<HEADLINE> Cienfuegos, Arce Work Out Deals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Los Angeles Galaxy midfielder Mauricio  
Cienfuegos and San Jose Clash forward Raul Diaz Arce have 
renegotiated contracts with Major League Soccer after vowing to 
return to their native El Salvador if they didn't get more money. 
</P>
<P>
	They are making about $118,000 each this season in the first of  
two option years in their contracts. Details of the new four-year 
deals were not disclosed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The deal was significantly more than they're currently  
earning,'' said Cory Clemetson, their agent. ``The players are 
happy and relieved that it's over with. They were very serious 
about permanently leaving the league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The contracts were agreed upon Thursday during a meeting in Los  
Angeles with league commissioner Douglas Logan, MLS player 
operations chief Ivan Gazidis and Clemetson. 
</P>
<P>
	Cienfuegos and Diaz Arce missed the first six weeks of training  
camp while seeking higher salaries. Both agreed to play in their 
teams' first two matches while negotiations continued. 
</P>
<P>
	The Galaxy (2-0) plays in San Jose (1-1) Saturday night.  
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Cienfuegos played in 30 of the Galaxy's 32 games,  
scoring a career-high 42 points on 13 goals and 16 assists. He was 
second in the MLS in assists and tied for third in game-winning 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Under MLS' single-entity ownership structure, all players sign  
contracts with the league, with its marquee players then assigned 
to teams.

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Pursue Steel Complaints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. steel industry won a partial victory  
Friday as the government decided to pursue trade complaints against 
six of eight countries accused of illegally pricing cut-to-length 
steel plates. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases form the second round of complaints filed by major  
U.S. steel producers who have been struggling against a recent 
surge in steel imports. In the first round, the government is 
considering tariffs on hot-rolled carbon steel from Japan and 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. International Trade Commission voted to drop cases  
against the Czech Republic and Macedonia after finding their 
shipments of cut-to-length plates to be negligible -- less than 3 
percent of overall imports to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency, meanwhile, found evidence that shipments of that  
product from France, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan and South Korea 
have hurt U.S. producers, paving the way for a Commerce Department 
investigation that could lead to tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic steel producers and steelworkers have blamed the  
imports for thousands of layoffs and three U.S. company 
bankruptcies. 
</P>
<P>
	Although imports have since dropped, steel producers continue to  
press the administration and Congress for help. 
</P>
<P>
	The imports reached record highs last year as the Asian economic  
crisis reduced demand for steel abroad and forced foreign producers 
to turn to U.S. markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Curtis H. Barnette, chairman and chief executive of Bethlehem  
Steel Corp., called Friday's action affirmation ``that the steel 
crisis continues and that decisive, prompt and comprehensive action 
is required in response.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Japanese steel executive, Fujio Ono, has called the cases  
unjustified, saying market forces and not artificial trade 
practices were responsible for the import surge. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Bethlehem Steel, four other steel producers and the  
United Steelworkers of America accused the eight countries of 
illegally dumping cut-to-length steel in the United States at 
prices below production costs or home-market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	They also accused France, India, Indonesia, Italy, Macedonia and  
South Korea of unfairly subsidizing their producers to artificially 
lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department has until mid-May to issue a preliminary  
finding on subsidies and until late July to initially rule on 
dumping. 
</P>
<P>
	Cut-to-length plate, thicker than the widely used hot-rolled  
variety, is used in agricultural and construction equipment, 
bridges, ships, railcars and buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	In the hot-rolled cases, the Commerce Department has issued  
preliminary dumping findings against Japan, Russia and Brazil. 
Final rulings are expected by summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan and Brazil face tariffs of up to 71 percent if the  
findings are affirmed and found to threaten U.S. industry. Russia 
has reached a deal with the United States to avoid tariffs by 
voluntarily curtailing shipments.

<HEADLINE> Whitewater Witness Testifies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Called to bolster Susan McDougal's  
complaints of unfair tactics, another woman indicted by Whitewater 
prosecutors testified today that she was pressured to back up the 
story of a presidential accuser even though she ``didn't know 
anything'' about the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
	Julie Hiatt Steele said she was charged with obstruction of  
justice and making false statements after she refused to support 
the story of Kathleen Willey, who said President Clinton made an 
unwanted sexual advance toward her in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willey has said she told Ms. Steele about the Clinton  
incident right after it happened. Ms. Steele has testified that her 
friend didn't say anything like that to her back in 1993 but later 
asked Ms. Steele to lie and say she was told. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr investigated Mrs. Willey's  
allegation as part of the Monica Lewinsky matter. 
</P>
<P>
	After testifying before two grand juries, Ms. Steele said that  
in November 1998 she was ``invited to a secret meeting at the 
office of the independent counsel to clarify my testimony. I 
believed I was to support Kathleen Willey's version of the story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Were you able to do that? asked defense attorney Mark Geragos.  
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't do it. I left the meeting in tears. I didn't know  
anything,'' she replied. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele was called by attorneys for Mrs. McDougal, who is on  
trial on charges of criminal contempt and obstruction of justice 
for refusing twice to answer federal grand jury questions about the 
Clintons' business dealings. Mrs. McDougal said she feared Starr 
would charge her with perjury if she didn't say what he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge George Howard decided to allow limited  
testimony from Ms. Steele ``to show modus operandi'' of Starr and 
his deputies. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele, who lives in Richmond, Va., said despite what she  
considered her minor role in the case, prosecutors questioned one 
of her daughters, her brother, her former attorney and her 
neighbors and friends. She said a grand jury subpoenaed her 
daughter's boyfriend and even ``asked if he had sex with me.'' The 
judge ordered jurors to disregard that remark. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Steele said she was upset that some family members also were  
asked about the adoption of her son Adam, now 8, from Romania. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's lawyer, Mark Geragos, says both she and Ms.  
Steele have similar accounts of what happens when a person doesn't 
cooperate with a prosecutor who is out to ``get'' Clinton. As does 
Ms. Steele, Mrs. McDougal claims she cooperated with Starr's office 
in its investigations until it became clear to her that Starr did 
not want the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want the jury to get the impression that she's some  
lone voice in the wilderness,'' Geragos said of his client. ``It's 
the only way she can prove that these fears were legitimate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr prosecutor Mark Barrett said the judge's ruling to allow  
the testimony was ``mammoth'' and he expressed disbelief that Ms. 
Steele would be willing to testify under oath with her May 3 trial 
in Alexandria, Va., only weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrett predicted the McDougal trial would be extended by weeks  
and could turn into ``a mini-trial'' of Ms. Steele, but later 
seemed confident the prosecution could cross-examine Ms. Steele in 
one day. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial is in its fourth week. It is expected to go to the  
jury next week.

	Jennifer Fuente was unable to get out before the train slammed  
into the 1988 Oldsmobile, pushing it about 2,000 feet down the 
tracks, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The car had stopped for flashing lights at a railroad crossing  
Thursday night when another car rammed it from behind, spinning the 
vehicle onto the tracks, where it stalled, according to the Florida 
Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
	The second car continued across the tracks and through the  
crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	Two people in the rammed car were injured when they jumped out  
as it came to a halt. The driver, 22-year-old Michelle Fuente, 
suffered minor injuries and a passenger, 18-year-old Caroline 
Taveras, was seriously injured, authorities said. Ms. Taveras was 
listed in fair condition today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vehicle itself is almost unrecognizable,'' said Phil  
Kaplan, spokesman for West Palm Beach Fire-Rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver of the 1993 Ford that made it across the tracks,  
Pablo J. Valle, 33, suffered minor injuries, as did two passengers.

<HEADLINE>  Canadians Celebrate New Territory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IQALUIT, Nunavut (AP) -- Canada's new arctic territory, Nunavut,  
mixed partying and protocol on the first day of its existence, and 
unveiled its flag -- appropriately emblazoned with the North Star. 
</P>
<P>
	Highlights of daylong celebrations Thursday included the first  
session of Nunavut's Inuit-led legislature, the first in Canada or 
the United States to be dominated by aboriginals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have successfully changed the map of Canada, and in doing  
... we have scored a victory for democracy that is being heard 
across the world,'' said Paul Okalik, the 34-year-old lawyer 
elected by fellow legislators as Nunavut's first premier. 
</P>
<P>
	Nunavut, as big as Western Europe, is formed out of the eastern  
and central portions of the Northwest Territories. It has 25,000 
people, 85 percent of them Inuit, and was created to give the Inuit 
a chance at self-government. 
</P>
<P>
	The territory is plagued by severe social ills, including high  
rates of crime, suicide and joblessness. But Prime Minister Jean 
Chretien predicted the Inuit would succeed by using a fusion of 
traditional and modern know-how. 
</P>
<P>
	``The North of today is no longer hostage to geography and  
climate,'' he said during a 90-minute ceremony. ``It is very much 
part of the wired world, with equal opportunities for growth and 
development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Okalik, Chretien and other dignitaries looking on, young  
military cadets unfurled Nunavut's flag. It depicts the North Star 
in one corner and an inuksuk -- an Inuit guidepost made of stones -- 
in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Through the centuries, they have guided you across the snow to  
your homes,'' said Canada's governor-general, Romeo LeBlanc. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony was opened by three elders who blessed the new  
territory and punctuated with entertainment by Inuit performers. An 
eight-member troupe performed a drum dance, leaping and chanting 
while beating hand-held drums, and five women demonstrated the 
ancient art of throat singing, which produces haunting sounds 
through special breathing techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	Other events included a fiddle-and-accordion festival, a rock  
concert by Inuit heavy-metal band Angava, and a community feast 
featuring caribou, raw fish and musk ox. 
</P>
<P>
	Nunavut means ``our land'' in Inuktitut, the Inuit language that  
will be one of the territory's official languages, along with 
English and French. Fifteen of the 19 new legislators are Inuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Okalik, who for many years was involved in the difficult  
negotiations to resolve Inuit land claims, requested a moment of 
silence during the legislative session to commemorate Inuit lost to 
suicide, violence and abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has always given me strength to know that those we have  
lost along the way are watching us here and smiling,'' he said in 
Inuktitut. ``We are no longer dreaming. This is reality. We have 
arrived.''

<HEADLINE> Capture of Soldiers Hits Home Hard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Bernie Rios' heart sank when he flipped on  
his television and saw boyhood friend Andrew Ramirez after he was 
captured by Serb forces at the Yugoslavia-Macedonia border. 
</P>
<P>
	Rios, 33, grew up two houses down from the Ramirez family in a  
blue-collar East Los Angeles neighborhood, played touch football 
with him on the street and saw him grow into a clean-cut young man. 
</P>
<P>
	And then this image on his TV screen: the 24-year-old Army staff  
sergeant in his camouflage fatigues, looking tired and bruised. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it's one of your own,'' Rios said Friday, ``it really  
touches you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia have finally hit home for  
many Hispanic-American residents of East Los Angeles, which over 
the years has sent thousands of its native sons into uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way I can say how I feel. Everyone knows,''  
Ramirez's mother, Vivian, told about 200 people at a candlelight 
prayer vigil Friday. ``I have more faith that my son will be coming 
home soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hispanic-Americans have come into harm's way long before Ramirez  
decided to join the Army, and they'll do so for years to come, said 
Daniel Ortiz, a Gulf War veteran and commander of the local 
Veterans of Foreign Wars post. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortiz's VFW branch is housed at American Legion Post 804, a navy  
blue building tucked among modest storefronts on Cesar Chavez 
Avenue. Inside, the names of Hispanic-American veterans are etched 
on murals, plaques and pictures that cover the walls. 
</P>
<P>
	The veterans' fierce patriotism is obvious. One bumper sticker  
with an American flag reads, ``YOU'LL BURN IT OVER MY DEAD BODY!'' 
A flyer tacked on a bulletin board features a sniper's target 
superimposed over a mug shot of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being the hyphenated 'Mexican-American,' a lot of people take  
it for granted that we ARE American, first and foremost,'' Ortiz 
said. ``A lot of people join the military to show we want to be 
counted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, Hispanic-Americans joined because they didn't have  
enough money to go to college. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our people needed an alternative, so they joined the military  
and had pride in being an American,'' Ortiz said. ``When our 
country calls, we're proud to step forward and defend our country. 
Now, it's like a tradition with our culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They enlist to break free from a landscape of few opportunities  
and low-paying jobs, said Rios, whose father was a Marine corporal 
during the Korean conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Down the street from Post 804 is the ``Five Points'' memorial,  
dedicated to Hispanic-Americans who served in every U.S. military 
conflict. Walking past was John Murro, a 58-year-old who served at 
an Army field hospital during the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
	Murro became jaded by the lack of support on the home front when  
he returned to the United States from Vietnam, but he has been 
encouraged by the outpouring of sympathy for the Ramirez family. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt so bad for them,'' Murro said. ``But I saw the yellow  
ribbons and I think that's great. It makes you feel like there are 
some good people still out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Similar outpourings of support were happening in the hometowns  
of the two other soldiers captured by Yugoslav troops. 
</P>
<P>
	In Capac, Mich., people headed to church Friday to pray for Army  
Staff Sgt. Christopher Stone. ``You always think it's somebody 
else's family this is going to happen to,'' said Deanna Stone, his 
sister. ``I just want to go over and help him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, those who met with the parents of Army Spc. Steven  
Gonzales described them as apprehensive, waiting anxiously for 
information as court proceedings there got under way against the 
three Americans.

<HEADLINE> Opening Day Fever Hits Monterrey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) -- By the time the ticket window opened,  
there already were several thousand people in line. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball fever had struck this northern Mexican city, and word  
that an extra 1,000 tickets would go on sale for Sunday night's 
major league opener between the San Diego Padres and Colorado 
Rockies set off a scramble. 
</P>
<P>
	By 2 a.m. Thursday, there were close to 1,000 people waiting.  
Later in the morning, the stadium parking lot was jammed with fans 
in cowboy hats and baseball caps alike. 
</P>
<P>
	At the front of the line was Leticia Gonzalez, a 43-year-old  
homemaker who said she had been waiting a full 24 hours to buy 
tickets for herself and her three sons, all of whom play in youth 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't go to Colorado to see Vinny (Castilla),'' she said.  
``This is probably the only chance I'll get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For most of the people in line, the extra tickets meant only  
more frustration. The tickets sold out in less than an hour, 
leaving thousands wanting. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundred people jumped up and down on the car of a man  
accused of being a scalper, demanding that he sell them his tickets 
at cost. A half-dozen terrified policemen finally extricated the 
man safely. 
</P>
<P>
	As is the case across much of northern and coastal Mexico,  
baseball is big in Monterrey, an industrial center just a couple of 
hours south of the Texas border. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball had an indisputable dominance here in the 1940s, when  
the Mexican League was flush with money and brought down players 
from the Major Leagues and the Negro Leagues. Roy Campanella played 
for the local Sultans. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past decades, Mexico's television networks have pitched  
soccer and recently have stopped broadcasting Mexican baseball 
games, but in Monterrey baseball continues to be a major sport. 
</P>
<P>
	That allegiance has paid off before with visits by major league  
teams. In 1991 and 1993 U.S. teams played exhibition games in 
Monterrey, and in 1996 the Padres and the Mets staged a three-game 
series here. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents consider Sunday's opening-day game a confirmation of  
their fanaticism -- and many hope it means someday a big league 
franchise could be located here, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a question of time and economic stability,'' said  
Hector Bencomo, a Sultans official and baseball commentator on 
local television and radio. ``The fans are ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, in addition to the Sultans, a professional team with one  
of the best stadiums in Mexico, Monterrey has 53 little leagues in 
which thousands of children hope to follow in Castilla's footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Monterrey's Guadalupe Linda Vista team of 12-year-olds  
won the Little League World Series, and in 1998 the team was Latin 
American champs. 
</P>
<P>
	On a recent afternoon, the Linda Vista Marlins -- a team in the  
city's Pacifier League -- was practicing for a big game. The 
players, all under 5 years old, struggled with the weight of their 
miniature bats, but some managed to connect and take off scrambling 
toward first base. 
</P>
<P>
	Otilia Lopez, a 30-year-old homemaker, proudly watched from the  
stands as her 4-year-old son, Naoki, stood for batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We bought him his batting cage. We bought him four gloves and  
a lot of baseballs,'' she said. ``So of course we're going to take 
him to see the game.''

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Rise on Job Growth News / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices climbed Friday as the government  
reported sluggish job growth and a moderate rise in average wages 
in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, which showed the unemployment rate sinking to a  
29-year low of 4.2 percent last month, provided little incentive 
for Federal Reserve policymakers to change their current monetary 
policy, market watchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 1/16  
point, or $10.06 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, fell to 5.59 percent from 5.67 percent 
late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bond market was open for a half day on Friday even as the  
stock market was closed for the Good Friday holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported the March unemployment rate fell  
0.2 percentage point from 4.4 percent in February and was the 
lowest since February 1970, when the rate was also 4.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But employers added just 46,000 jobs, after seasonal adjustment,  
to their payrolls, down from gains of 297,000 in February and 
217,000 in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Seto, a senior economist for Nikko Securities International,  
said the job growth fell short of expectations in part because warm 
weather in February had allowed employers to start hiring seasonal 
workers earlier than normal. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the slower growth provided ``some indication of  
softening taking place'' in the job market and the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also said average hourly wages edged up 3 cents in  
March to $13.09, and are up 3.6 percent from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Seto described the wage increase as moderate and said ``We are  
not seeing much wage pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the report suggests the Fed will follow ``a steady  
policy for a litle longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were up by between 1/8 point and 3/8 point, and intermediate maturities 
were up by as much as 5/8 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.40 percent as the  
discount lost 0.01 percentage point to 4.29 percent. Six-month 
yields were 4.47 percent, as the discount dropped 0.02 percentage 
point to 4.31 percent. One-year yields were 4.65 percent as the 
discount fell 0.04 percentage point from late Thursday to 4.43 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4 7/8 percent from 5 1/2 percent late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds was  
unavailable.

<HEADLINE> Police Baffled by Iowa Murders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) -- Laura Watson Dalton and Maria Therese  
Lehner didn't know each other, but they apparently had a lot in 
common. Friends say both were outgoing, caring, just nice to be 
around. 
</P>
<P>
	They share a horrible link: Both were killed by multiple blows  
to the head, their bodies discovered March 19 in a gutted apartment 
that was intentionally set on fire to destroy evidence and cover up 
the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	Police don't know if the women -- complete strangers to each  
other by all accounts -- died together or how they ended up in an 
apartment near downtown being rented by three college students. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, there is still no connection with the apartment ...  
and the two victims. There just isn't any reason for them to be 
there at this point that investigators have been able to figure 
out,'' Police Sgt. Mike Lord said this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Lehner, 27, lived in Belton, Mo., a Kansas City suburb, and was  
employed by Bregman &AMP; Co. of Bethesda, Md., to do environmental 
contract work with U.S. Army reserve units in Iowa, Missouri and 
Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson Dalton, 29, a native of Omaha, Neb., had been a paramedic  
for six months in Creston, 150 miles southwest of Iowa City. 
</P>
<P>
	A big question is how the woman ended up at the apartment, which  
was rented by three University of Iowa students. Two were away for 
spring break that week and a third has been studying overseas. The 
students told police they did not know the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors told investigators that they heard male voices in the  
apartment but assumed it was the students. 
</P>
<P>
	Police know this much.  
</P>
<P>
	Lehner was in Cedar Rapids, about 30 miles north of Iowa City,  
for a March 18 appointment. She left the reserve unit that 
afternoon, but never made it to an appointment the next day in Iowa 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, police arrested Johnathon Lee Memmer, 23, on a parole  
violation stemming from a 1997 burglary conviction. Memmer was 
being held on $1 million cash bond and was not cooperating with 
police. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are questioning Memmer because he was seen  
partying on St. Patrick's Day with Watson Dalton and a group of 
people. That was two days before the bodies were discovered, while 
Watson Dalton was in town to visit a cousin and some friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are certain points in an investigation where you can  
rule a person out as a suspect,'' Lord said. ``There are also 
points where a person emerges as a suspect. So far, Memmer is 
somewhere in between those two points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Lehner's hometown of Norwalk, a tightknit community of 560  
people in western Wisconsin, grief and shock is turning into anger. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had anything to say to the police, it would be, `Get this  
guy, this person who did it. Go on every little lead. This is 
undeserving of anybody,''' said Kathy Degenhardt, Lehner's high 
school classmate.

<HEADLINE> Portmans Agree To Settle Suits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Architect-developer John C. Portman Jr. and his  
son have reportedly agreed to settle two sexual harassment suits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got the word that they had worked both cases out,'' Judge  
John R. Strother Jr. of U.S. District Court told The Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution on Thursday. ``...They are going to send some 
papers in to the court next week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, two former employees filed the lawsuits, which also  
targeted AMC Inc., the Portman firm that operates the downtown 
trade market complex. 
</P>
<P>
	Stacey Schoppenhorst and Masa Kisner alleged they were subjected  
to ongoing verbal and physical harassment during their employment 
by AMC and that the company allowed a climate of sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal-Constitution said neither the attorney for the women  
nor the attorneys for Jeffrey Portman or AMC responded Thursday to 
phone inquiries about the settlement. John Portman's attorney could 
not be reached, it said.

	NATO Airstrikes Hit Belgrade  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Three loud explosions rocked  
downtown Belgrade early Saturday as NATO brought its airstrike to 
the center of the Yugoslav capital. Shortly after the impact, 
flames could be seen rising from a section of town where the 
Interior and Defense ministries are located. At the Pentagon, 
spokesman Kenneth Bacon said, ``We can confirm that targets are 
being hit in downtown Belgrade.'' He provided no other details.

	NATO Jets Pound Kosovo Targets  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO jets pounded targets in Kosovo,  
trying to keep Yugoslav troops on the move and force them to waste 
precious fuel. Ten days into its air campaign, NATO conceded it has 
failed to stop Serb forces from expelling tens of thousands of 
Kosovo Albanians, but insisted it would press on. Meanwhile, tens 
of thousands more refugees crossed borders out of the province, 
leading to chaotic scenes of masses overwhelming local communities 
and relief agencies struggling to supply food, medicine and 
blankets.

	U.S. Carrier May Join NATO Forces  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Navy aircraft carrier was approaching the  
Mediterranean Sea today and was likely to join the fight against 
Yugoslavia, senior Defense Department officials said. As the allies 
expanded their air assault, President Clinton said it was clear to 
him from the start that the campaign against Yugoslavia would not 
be a ``week or two operation.'' Clinton again said he had no 
intention of introducing American ground forces into the conflict, 
although he did not explicitly rule it out.

	Jury Wants Navigator Out of Marines  
</P>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A military jury has recommended  
dismissal from the Marine Corps for a navigator who admitted 
destroying a personal videotape he made before his jet cut an 
Italian ski gondola cable, killing 20 people. Capt. Joseph 
Schweitzer pleaded guilty Monday to obstruction of justice and 
conspiracy for destroying the tape after his EA-6B Prowler hit the 
cable over Cavalese, Italy, on Feb. 3, 1998. The ski gondola 
plunged 370 feet into a valley.

	U.S. Appeals Internet Porn Ruling  
</P>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Justice Department today appealed a  
judge's ruling that blocked enforcement of a federal Internet 
pornography law. Government lawyers had until today to decide 
whether to appeal U.S. District Judge Lowell A. Reed's Feb. 1 
preliminary injunction barring enforcement of the Child Online 
Protection Act. The law would require commercial Web sites to 
collect a credit card number or some other access code as proof of 
age before allowing Internet users to view online material deemed 
``harmful to minors.''

	Pilgrims Meet in Gethsemane

<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Easter week has increased the number of  
visitors to the garden of Gethsemane, the place where Jesus was 
betrayed by Judas' kiss. Easter 1999 signals that the season of 
millennial pilgrimage has begun in earnest. Gethsemane, a small, 
walled-in grove of ancient olive trees, is the traditional site of 
Judas' kiss, the signal to Roman soldiers that Jesus was the one 
they had come to arrest. Visitors from all over world clutch 
Bibles, listen to tour guides or find a rocky ledge to sit alone 
for a few moments in silence.

	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia Flyers star center Eric Lindros  
will sit out at least the remainder of the regular season because 
of a collapsed right lung. Lindros, who is third in the NHL in 
scoring with 40 goals and 93 points, was injured when cross-checked 
during the Flyers' game at Nashville last night. Nearly three 
quarts of blood filled the space where the lung collapsed, and 
doctors are draining the blood out with a chest tube. They have 
inserted a vacuum pump in the lung to help re-expand it.

	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Former heavyweight champion George Foreman  
will likely testify later this month before a federal grand jury 
investigating boxing's sanctioning organizations, according to his

<HEADLINE> Timberwolves 107, Nuggets 88 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Terrell Brandon dominated the third quarter  
for the second consecutive game, scoring 15 of his 21 points to 
lead the Minnesota Timberwolves to a 107-88 victory over the Denver 
Nuggets on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon, who tied a team record by shooting 7-for-7 for 16  
third-quarter points Tuesday against Dallas, went 5-for-7 and 
scored 15 in the third this time. That helped the Wolves turn a 
52-50 halftime lead into an 81-68 advantage heading into the final 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon also had 15 assists and finished two rebounds shy of his  
first career triple-double. Kevin Garnett had 28 points, seven 
assists and six rebounds as the Wolves won for the fifth time in 
seven games. Sam Mitchell added 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota shot 57 percent, compared to 43.4 for the Nuggets, who  
are 0-16 on the road this season and have lost 23 straight away 
from home. 
</P>
<P>
	Chauncey Billups scored 30 for Denver after getting a  
career-high 32 in Thursday's win over Seattle. Danny Fortson had 15 
points and 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Acquired last month from Milwaukee in the three-team deal that  
sent Stephon Marbury to New Jersey, Brandon got his 10th assist of 
the first half on a jumper by Mitchell with 16 seconds left to give 
the Wolves a 52-50 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon missed his first shot of the third quarter, but Garnett  
soared to dunk the rebound. That started a 14-6 run that put the 
Wolves in control, and Brandon either scored or assisted on every 
basket but one in that stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	He hit three straight jumpers to make it 60-52, then fed  
Mitchell for a jumper and Garnett for a fast-break dunk for a 66-56 
lead, Minnesota's first double-digit lead of the night. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon finished the third quarter with a 3-pointer with three  
seconds left, putting the Wolves up 81-68. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The Wolves have won 10 of 11 against Denver, including five  
straight. This is the last of their three meetings this season. ... 
After committing just 10 turnovers in each of their last two games, 
the Nuggets had 17 Friday. ... Nick Van Exel came in averaging 26.3 
points over his last four games, including consecutive season highs 
of 29 and 31 this week. He scored 13 on 6-for-18 shooting. ... The 
Wolves came in hitting 26.6 from 3-point range, the worst 
percentage in the league. They went 6-for-12, including 4-for-5 by 
Dennis Scott.

<HEADLINE> Steinbrenner Still Supports Irabu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Hideki Irabu has lost his place in the New  
York Yankees' rotation, for now. He has not lost the support of 
owner George Steinbrenner, at least not yet. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after Steinbrenner called the Japanese pitcher a ``fat ...  
toad,'' the Yankees said Friday that Ramiro Mendoza will start in 
place of Irabu next Wednesday at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how long Mendoza would pitch in Irabu's spot, interim  
manager Don Zimmer declined to say. Irabu stayed at the team's camp 
in Tampa, Fla., while the Yankees traveled to the West Coast for 
weekend exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
	Irabu raised Steinbrenner's ire Thursday by failing to cover  
first base in a spring game for the second time in a week. 
Steinbrenner indicated the pitcher may not rejoin the Yankees on 
Tuesday, as previously expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we feel he's right, which hopefully will be Tuesday.  
That's just a target ... He may not be quite ready yet,'' 
Steinbrenner said. ``I think he'll join the team hopefully 
understanding that if nothing else, there is one guy in the Yankee 
picture that is his friend and supporter and that's probably the 
most important guy of all, me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner sounded a little more forgiving about play at first  
base, saying his ``toad'' remark was ``ill-timed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He got fooled in my opinion,'' Steinbrenner said. ``I'll give  
him some (slack) on that. It still doesn't cover the fact that we 
work on that play. I saw many good things from him. He threw the 
ball well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner added Irabu's weight of 252 pounds, which is 12-14  
pounds above the Yankees goal, is a concern, adding ``252 pounds is 
crazy ... it's insanity. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's failed to do the job -- our trainers, our general manager,  
right down the line -- we have failed to work with him to get that 
weight down. He is far too heavy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Irabu has struggled this spring, going 0-2 with an 8.38 ERA. He  
has allowed 19 runs -- 18 earned -- and 30 hits in 19 1-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can turn it around and make a better Irabu out of it,  
OK,'' Steinbrenner said. ``I didn't send him down. I didn't keep 
him back here. It was not my doing. He had expressed he didn't want 
to make the trip. He wasn't ready yet. So I made the decision to 
let him stay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irabu spent two hours at the Yankees' minor league facility  
Friday. In addition to an indoor workout, he met with several team 
officials, including general manager Brian Cashman. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have to make him understand that we are with him. The  
Yankees need him -- underline need,'' Steinbrenner said. ``We have 
to try and understand what's in his mind. The one thing we have to 
get across to him is we are totally supportive of Hideki -- 
totally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what else is out there lurking, but I'm going to  
find it out in the next three days,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner did not meet with Irabu on Friday, but was updated  
on the matter before watching a Triple-A game featuring left-hander 
Andy Pettitte. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far, so good,'' Steinbrenner said.  
</P>
<P>
	Irabu did not meet with reporters.  
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Pettitte -- on a 55-to-60 pitch limit -- allowed one run and  
four hits over 2 1-3 innings. Making his second minor league start 
since straining a muscle in his throwing elbow on March 7, Pettitte 
struck out two and walked two. ``Getting my pitch count up is the 
goal down here,'' said Pettitte, who will throw around 75 pitches 
next Wednesday said. ``I threw everything and felt good.'' Tampa 
Bay Devil Rays OF-DH Paul Sorrento went 2-for-3 and SS Kevin 
Stocker was hitless in three at-bats. Sorrento and Stocker, playing 
for Durham against Columbus, led off the first three innings. ... 
Roger Clemens will pitch the season opener Monday at Oakland. 
Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez will start the second game, followed 
by Mendoza.

<HEADLINE>  Baffert Tries for Another 1-2 Finish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Because Aaron Jones listened to Bob  
Baffert, he has his first Santa Anita Derby starter and a possible 
serious Kentucky Derby contender in Prime Timber. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Baffert didn't listen to his 12-year-old son, Tyler, he  
is the trainer, but not the owner, of Prime Timber, who will try to 
give Baffert his second straight Santa Anita Derby victory, then 
try for an unprecedented third consecutive win for Baffert in the 
Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Baffert recalled a telephone conversation with Jones  
that led to Florida-bred Prime Timber being bought for $375,000 as 
a 2-year-old at the 1998 Ocala Sale. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Jones, we've got to buy this thing,'' Baffert said. ``He's  
unbelievable. He reminds me of Silver Charm (second in the Santa 
Anita Derby and winner of the Kentucky Derby in 1997).'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 77-year-old Jones, in the lumber business in Oregon and a  
racehorse owner for nearly 30 years, admitted Friday that he was 
reluctant at first. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has no pedigree,'' Jones told Baffert. The colt is by  
Sultry Song out of the Nodouble mare Wine Taster. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's OK, he can run,'' Baffert replied.  
</P>
<P>
	After Baffert hung up with Jones, his son, who had been  
listening, said, ``Why are you buying it for him, buy it for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Timber, ridden by David Flores, probably will be the  
post-time favorite for the 1 1/8-mile Santa Anita Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	In his last start, the colt, wearing blinkers for the first  
time, won the 1 1-16-mile San Felipe March 13. That was his first 
win in two starts as a 3-year-old and his third victory in five 
career races. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his two seconds came in his 3-year-old debut when, racing  
wide throughout, he was runner-up by a neck to Santa Anita Derby 
contender Desert Hero in the one-mile San Rafael Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert will not only be seeking his third Santa Anita Derby  
victory -- his first was in 1996 with Cavonnier, the Kentucky Derby 
runner-up -- he also will be trying for a second straight 1-2 
finish. He got that last year with Indian Charlie and Real Quiet. 
The latter won the Kentucky Derby, with Indian Charlie third. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert's other Santa Anita Derby starter and Kentucky Derby  
hopeful is General Challenge, a California-bred gelding, ridden by 
Gary Stevens and owned by John and Betty Mabee. 
</P>
<P>
	General Challenge, who won his only two starts last year and  
also his 3-year-old debut, finished fifth in his last start, the 1 
1-16-mile Louisiana Derby March 14. He will race with blinkers for 
the first time Saturday. He wore them for the first time when he 
worked five-eighths of a mile in 57 3-5 seconds March 23 at Santa 
Anita. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel as confident going into this race as I did last year,  
and it's a tougher race this year,'' Baffert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the opposition that his pair will face, Baffert noted Desert  
Hero and the filly Honest Lady. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the field for the $750,000 race are Capsized, Hire Wire  
Act, Charismatic and Walk That Walk. 
</P>
<P>
	Desert Hero, a son of 1993 Kentucky Derby winner Sea Hero, is  
ridden by Corey Nakatani and owned by Prince Ahmed bin Salman of 
Saudi Arabia. He did not race as a 2-year-old, making his debut 
with a victory Feb. 7 at Santa Anita, then winning the San Rafael. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Desert Hero wins this race, he's a super horse,'' Baffert  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Honest Lady, Baffert said, ``Bobby Frankel wouldn't let  
her in if he didn't think she had a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Frankel said Honest Lady has to win Saturday to earn a  
shot at the Kentucky Derby or if she doesn't win, ``I would think 
she would have to have a big excuse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Honest Lady, ridden by Kent Desormeaux and owned by Prince  
Khalid Abdullah, also of Saudi Arabia, won her first two starts, 
then made her debut against colts in the San Rafael. She finished 
fifth, but only one length behind winner Desert Hero. 
</P>
<P>
	Honest Lady will carry 115 pounds to 120 for each of the other  
starters. Three fillies have won the race -- Ciencia (1939), Silver 
Spoon (1959) and Winning Colors (1988). Winning Colors also was the 
third, and last, filly to win the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Capsized, third in the San Rafael, is trained by Lisa Lewis,  
only the fifth woman to saddle a horse for the Santa Anita Derby. 
None has won.

<HEADLINE> Collapsed Lung Sidelines Lindros </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Eric Lindros will miss the rest of the  
regular season because of a collapsed lung, an injury that 
apparently happened when he was checked during a game against 
Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers said Friday their star center will stay at the  
hospital in Nashville at least another two or three days. His 
status for the playoffs, if the Flyers qualify, will be determined 
when he returns to Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a serious injury,'' team president and general manager  
Bobby Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
	The team is unsure precisely when Lindros was hurt Thursday  
night. The injury seemed to happen when he was crosschecked, but 
television replays also showed the 6-foot-4 center falling on his 
stick in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers said nearly three quarts of blood filled the space  
where the right lung collapsed, and doctors at Baptist Hospital in 
Nashville are draining blood with a chest tube. 
</P>
<P>
	Flyers team physician Dr. Gary Dorshimer said doctors in  
Nashville inserted a vacuum pump in the lung to help re-expand it. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros spoke with reporters in the locker room for several  
minutes following the Flyers' 2-1 victory over the Predators and 
did not appear in pain. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he awakened Friday with chest pains and went to the  
hospital. The hospital referred all questions to the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Lindros, Eric's father and agent, did not immediately  
return a call. 
</P>
<P>
	The 26-year-old star remained in Nashville while the rest of the  
team flew to Boston, where the Flyers play the Bruins on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was checked in the ribs on the right side,'' Dorshimer  
said. ``He either suffered a rib fracture, or there was enough 
force with the sudden impact trauma that it caused a small 
micro-tear in the lung. That cause the lung to collapse and blood 
to fill in the space.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This was Lindros' first game following a two-game suspension for  
high-sticking and cutting Petr Nedved of the New York Rangers 
during Philadelphia's 3-1 victory Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros leads the Flyers with 40 goals and 93 points in 71  
games. The Flyers, who have seven games left in the regular season, 
already are without top defenseman Eric Desjardins. Philadelphia is 
tied with Pittsburgh for second place in the Atlantic Division. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros whiffed his one shot on goal Thursday night. Winger  
Mikael Renberg said the Flyers appreciated having their captain 
back following the two-game suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need him bad out there,'' Renberg said. ``I mean that's not  
easy for him not to play two games.''

<HEADLINE> NYC DiMaggio Monument in the Works </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WOBURN, Mass. (AP) -- A Massachusetts sculptor has landed a  
contract to memorialize Joe DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Shure of Burlington was asked to complete a bronze relief of  
DiMaggio. The bronze bust will be placed in Yankee Stadium 
alongside other memorials to baseball greats, including Babe Ruth 
and Lou Gehrig. 
</P>
<P>
	``To say I was thrilled was an underestimation,'' Shure told the  
Daily Times Chronicle of Woburn after being selected to do the 
portrait of DiMaggio, who died March 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Shure has made a clay mold of the portrait, which was presented  
to Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. The next step in the design 
will be a plaster model, then the bronze bust itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Shure previously made reliefs of Boston slugger Ted Williams for  
the tunnel named after him and another for pitcher Cy Young on 
Huntington Avenue in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Shire, whose studio is in Woburn, also worked on the Irish  
Famine Memorial on the Freedom Trail in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	The dedication of the DiMaggio relief is slated for April 25.  
DiMaggio's family is scheduled to be there, as are Steinbrenner and 
Shure. 
</P>
<P>
	DiMaggio, who died last month at 84, was immortalized in song  
and literature, a man respected as much for his dignity as for his 
accomplishments during 13 seasons with the Yankees. His 56-game 
hitting streak in 1941, one of the greatest feats in all sports, is 
still a record. 
</P>
<P>
	The wording on the relief for DiMaggio will read: Joseph Paul  
DiMaggio, ``The Yankee Clipper,'' 1914-1999. Recognized as 
Baseball's ``Greatest Living Player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The relief will also show DiMaggio's lifetime batting average of  
.325 and note that he won the Most Valuable Player awards in 1939, 
1941 and 1947. 
</P>
<P>
	It will also pay tribute to DiMaggio's other achievements,  
including his selection to the All-Star game 13 times and his 
American League batting titles in 1939 and 1940.

<HEADLINE>  Family, Friends Pray for Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	With bright yellow ribbons newly laced across their hometowns,  
relatives and friends of three U.S. servicemen facing trial in 
war-torn Yugoslavia wept and prayed for their safe return. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia said the men were invaders and would be tried today  
as criminals before a military court, despite demands from 
President Clinton that the soldiers be released. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is devastated. We're just praying to God he'll come  
out all right,'' said Frank Jasso, great-uncle of captive Staff 
Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles, Spc. Steven M. Gonzales, 21, of  
Huntsville, Texas, and Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, of 
Smiths Creek, Mich., were captured Wednesday near the 
Yugoslav-Macedonian border. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Stone learned his son had been taken by Yugoslav forces when  
a National Guard officer knocked on his door to deliver the news. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chris is a very special American and an incredibly proud  
soldier and we are very proud of him,'' Stone said, his voice 
breaking with emotion. 
</P>
<P>
	As U.S. networks showed Serb television images of the three men,  
relatives and friends strung yellow ribbons -- symbols of families 
waiting for soldiers to return from war -- all around their 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we saw him on TV it was a great relief, but of course we  
realize he's in a bad situation,'' said Gonzales' mother, Rosie. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steven and the two other soldiers are not criminals and should  
not be dealt with as criminals,'' she said. ``They are innocent 
young men over there as part of their duty to their country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Gonzales appeared battered and bruised, his family  
expressed relief he didn't look worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're dealing with it as best we can,'' said his father,  
Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzales was described as a likable, bright athlete during his  
high school days in Palestine, 90 miles north of Huntsville in east 
Texas. He graduated in 1995 and won a scholarship to Texas A&AMP;M, but 
left after a year to pursue a dream of joining an elite Army corps. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the type of student you'd love to have: hard-working,  
always happy, funny,'' said teacher Kay Stroud, who had Gonzales in 
her advanced placement biology class. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone, whose wife, Tricia, and 4-year-old son Ryan live in San  
Antonio, was described as a talented athlete also blessed with the 
``gift of gab.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm surprised he couldn't talk his way out of this,'' said Ken  
Marzka, Stone's cross-country coach at Capac Community 
Junior-Senior High School, about 50 miles northeast of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chris is a tough kid ... he never quit,'' Marzka said. ``Chris  
is going to be just fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	School counselor Kathy Kish said Stone was well-liked by  
students and teachers. He was a member of Students Against Drunk 
Driving. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't surprise us a bit that he's serving our country on  
a peace mission,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Los Angeles, outside the home of Ramirez's father, neighbors  
prayed for the captured staff sergeant and reminisced about the 
``all-American kid'' they watched grow up. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez, a wrestler in high school, joined the Army after  
graduation in 1992. He wanted to follow the path of his hero, older 
brother Steven, an Army veteran who is now a Los Angeles police 
detective. 
</P>
<P>
	The detective did not speak publicly, but did talk to police  
Cmdr. David Kalish. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very worried,'' Kalish said. ``He told me that his little  
brother is a very brave soldier and he's confident that he will be 
strong through this entire ordeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some neighbors wept as they talked outside the Ramirez home.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's a hero now because he did his duty as a military  
personnel,'' said neighbor and longtime friend Johnny Rios. ``We 
just thank God for putting him in our lives to serve the country.''

<HEADLINE> Mighty Ducks 4, Rangers 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Teemu Selanne scored two goals to increase his  
NHL-leading total to 45 as the Anaheim Mighty Ducks beat the New 
York Rangers 4-1 Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss was another blow to the Rangers' fading playoff hopes.  
New York trails Boston by seven points for the Eastern Conference's 
final playoff spot, with seven games left for the Rangers and eight 
for the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
	Anaheim took a 1-0 lead 2:28 into the game when Selanne  
intercepted a pass by Brian Leetch for a breakaway and beat goalie 
Mike Richter with a slapshot from outside the blue line. 
</P>
<P>
	Travis Green put the Ducks ahead 2-0 with his 13th goal of the  
season at 6:43 when he took a trailing pass from Pavel Trnka on a 
three-on-one break and beat Richter high to the far side. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Stevens made it 2-1 at 10:07 with his 22nd goal of the  
season. Stevens took a hard slapshot from the blue line that goalie 
Guy Hebert couldn't handle. 
</P>
<P>
	Selanne gave the Ducks a 3-1 lead with a power-play goal at  
10:09 of the second period, one-timing a pass from Paul Kariya into 
the net. 
</P>
<P>
	Selanne returned the favor at 16:41 of the second period,  
feeding Kariya during a four-on-four for his 35th goal of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Rangers center Petr Nedved, hindered by a strained ribcage  
muscle, played only 64 seconds over two first-period shifts and did 
not return to the ice.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Appeals Internet Porn Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Justice Department today appealed a  
judge's ruling that blocked enforcement of a federal law aimed at 
preventing minors from gaining access to Internet pornography. 
</P>
<P>
	The law, signed into law by President Clinton last year, would  
require commercial Web sites to collect a credit card number or an 
access code as proof of age before allowing Internet users to view 
online material deemed ``harmful to minors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Lowell Reed barred its enforcement Feb. 1  
after civil rights activists claimed it violates free speech 
guarantees and unfairly prosecutes gays, AIDS activists and others. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government is going to have an uphill battle in convincing  
the court of appeals that this law complies with the First 
Amendment,'' said David Sobel, general counsel for the Electronic 
Privacy Information Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department, which appealed to the 3rd Circuit Court  
of Appeals, argued the law would act as a ``brown paper wrapper'' 
protecting children from pornographic Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The Child Online Protection Act is the second major effort by  
Congress to protect children from Internet pornography after the 
U.S. Supreme Court struck down the Communications Decency Act of 
1996, which would have applied to both commercial and noncommercial 
Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The new law calls for maximum criminal penalties of six months  
in jail and $50,000 in fines, and additional fines for repeat 
violators.

<HEADLINE> Nationwide Mutual's CEO Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- The president and chief executive of  
Nationwide Mutual Insurance has resigned, effective April 23, to 
pursue other interests. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement about Richard Crabtree came yesterday hours  
before the annual policyholders meeting of the parent Nationwide 
Insurance Enterprise. No replacement was named immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide is the country's No. 4 insurer of homes and cars.  
</P>
<P>
	Crabtree, 58, joined the company 34 years ago as an underwriter  
in its Canton office. 
</P>
<P>
	During his three years leading the property-and-casualty  
operations, he oversaw last year's acquisition of Iowa-based 
insurer Allied Group and the sale of Nationwide's money-losing 
Wausau business-insurance affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, a jury in Richmond, Va., returned a $100 million  
verdict against the company in a racial discrimination case. 
Company spokesman John Millen said the award, which is under 
appeal, was not a factor in Crabtree's departure.

<HEADLINE> Murdoch May Buy Out Partner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Media mogul Rupert Murdoch has agreed to buy  
out a partner to expand his control of regional cable networks and 
his stake in two New York professional sports teams, published 
reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	Partner John Malone's Liberty Media will sell his 50 percent  
interest in Fox/Liberty Networks, the partnership he formed with 
Murdoch in 1995, in exchange for about $1.4 billion in stock from 
Murdoch's News Corp., reports in several newspapers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Times carried the report on Thursday, and  
similar reports appears in today's editions of The New York Times 
and The Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	The reports cited unidentified people familiar with the deal.  
</P>
<P>
	James Platt, a spokesman for Murdoch in New York, refused to  
comment Thursday. A spokeswoman for Liberty Media in Denver, 
reached today, also had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, the Los Angeles Times said News Corp. would take  
control of Fox/Liberty, which has interests in more than a dozen 
regional sports channels as well as in cable networks including 
Speedvision, Outdoor Life Network and the Golf Channel. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty would also sell Murdoch its half of the partnership's 40  
percent stake in the Staples Center under construction in Los 
Angeles, as well as its share of the partnership's 40 percent 
interests in the New York Knicks, the New York Rangers, Madison 
Square Garden and Radio City Music Hall, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone's sale to News Corp. does not include Liberty's 50  
percent interest in Atlanta-based Fox Sports South, the Los Angeles 
Times said.

<HEADLINE> Harrick Takes Georgia Job After All </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- Jim Harrick is on the recruiting trail as  
Georgia's basketball coach, hoping to put behind an embarrassing 
day of flip-flops that surely will raise questions about his 
commitment to the Bulldogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick returned to Athens on Friday after putting two schools  
through a tortuous day of indecision before he finally settled on 
the Georgia job after all. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited and ready to go to work,'' Harrick told reporters  
at yet another hastily called news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick originally accepted the job on Wednesday, then changed  
his mind Thursday morning and flew back to Rhode Island, where he 
coached the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at that school planned a welcoming-back news  
conference Thursday evening, but Harrick had another change of 
heart after meeting with his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia agreed to take him back after athletic director Vince  
Dooley consulted with president Michael Adams. Harrick flew back to 
Athens on Friday for the Bulldogs' third news conference in three 
days concerning the coaching position. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got caught in my emotions. I was all wrapped up in my  
family,'' Harrick said. ``That's all it was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick said his first priority was making contact with  
potential recruits, who can sign letters-of-intent on Wednesday. He 
planned to attend a high school all-star game in Detroit on Friday 
night, then return to Atlanta for the Naismith awards banquet 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	Next week, Harrick will meet with Georgia's returning players.  
He also hopes to convince sophomore Jumaine Jones, the team's 
leading scorer and rebounder, to make a flip-flop of his own and 
give college another season. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones announced he will enter the NBA draft, but that decision  
was made before Ron Jirsa was fired as coach after two mediocre 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick, showing a tinge of defiance as reporters probed for  
details about his decision, never explicitly apologized to either 
Georgia or Rhode Island for putting the schools through such an 
ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had it to do over again, I would probably handle it  
differently,'' he said. ``But hindsight is 20-20. Everybody in this 
room has said at some point, `I wish I had that to do over again.' 
I can say this has been an experience I don't want to go through 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Center Robb Dryden, one of the players who will be back next  
season, said he was ``shocked and a little sad'' when he first 
heard that Harrick wouldn't be taking the Georgia job. He was 
equally stunned when he heard the coach had changed his mind again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess it was a tough call for him,'' Dryden said. ``It  
probably hit him all at once.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dryden, who attended the Wednesday news conference when Harrick  
was originally hired, believes the players can recapture the 
excitement they felt about getting a coach who has been to 14 NCAA 
tournaments and won the 1995 national championship at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will work out. I'm confident it will,'' Dryden  
said. ``I don't think there will be any doubts in any of the 
players' minds. We pretty much understand what he was going through 
from his standpoint.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick doesn't think his indecision will have an impact on  
potential recruits, even though other schools are certain to point 
it out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can handle whatever recruiting is required,'' Harrick said.  
``If some people want to use this as a negative, fine. But I've 
never talked about other coaches or other schools, and it always 
seems to work out for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for the Georgia fans, who flooded Internet web sites and  
radio talk shows with their doubts about Harrick, he's not worried, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first dunk we get, the people will come,'' he said  
confidently. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he admitted that Georgia faces a rebuilding job. The  
Bulldogs lost three senior starters and will have to start over if 
Jones doesn't change his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a big job to do,'' Harrick said. ``I hope we can do  
it in a year, but you never know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing a white shirt embroidered with a Bulldogs logo and blue  
warm-up pants, Harrick said his indecision stemmed from his 
reluctance to leave behind two of his three sons in Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Jr. was a member of the Rams coaching staff but is barred  
from a job at Georgia because of the state's anti-nepotism law. 
Glenn Harrick recently moved to Rhode Island with his wife and two 
children to open a business. 
</P>
<P>
	The coach said his sons were waiting for him at the airport when  
he flew back to Rhode Island. They were joined via telephone by 
Harrick's other son, Monte, who lives in California. 
</P>
<P>
	``Georgia is the place for you,'' they told Harrick. ``Get on  
that plane and go back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So, he did.

<HEADLINE> Feds Monitor Air-Bag Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal safety officials are working with  
automakers to ensure that testing of side air bags includes 
procedures to avoid problems that caused serious injury or death to 
children in some front air bags. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  
say nobody has been reported killed or seriously injured by side 
air bags in accidents. The officials, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, said they are simply taking precautions to ensure the 
risks to children from side air bags are minimal. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulators are talking with nine manufacturers to try to  
make sure the best testing is being done by automakers to prevent 
problems that occurred with frontal air bag deployments, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers meeting with NHTSA include BMW, DaimlerChrysler,  
Audi, Ford and Volvo, an agency official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency also is conducting its own testing program on side  
air bags. 
</P>
<P>
	NHTSA has scheduled a public meeting for April 19 to bring  
together automakers, suppliers and consumer groups to discuss 
standardized methods of testing and to share testing approaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Air bags deploying from the front of autos, either on the driver  
or passenger side, have been blamed for killing 131 people, 
including 73 children. The federal safety agency has issued new 
rules to try to prevent such deaths from frontal air bags, a 
required safety feature in all new cars and light trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Side air bags are not required by law, but automakers have been  
installing them voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
	Agency officials also would like to see the industry voluntarily  
come up with a common approach for testing side air bags. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to automakers in December, the agency's  
administrator, Dr. Ricardo Martinez, applauded automakers' attempts 
to go beyond federal safety standards in installing side air bags. 
At the same time, he urged caution. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because these devices add energy to the interior compartment  
of a motor vehicle during a crash, it is imperative that they be 
designed to 'do no harm' to occupants,'' Martinez wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``In particular, it is extremely important to thoroughly test  
these devices with both child and adult dummies ... to guard 
against the risk of serious injury to occupants who may be very 
close to these systems when they deploy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In February at the Chicago Auto Show, General Motors Corp.  
officials said some competitors' side air bags could seriously 
injure or kill children leaning against them during a crash. 
</P>
<P>
	GM played videotapes of tests that show the neck of a small test  
dummy being snapped forward violently as an air bag was deployed. 
The dummy representing a 3-year-old was positioned as if it were a 
child sleeping against the door. 
</P>
<P>
	GM officials have declined to identify the automakers the  
company believes have side air bags that pose a threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are better off with side air bags than without them,''  
said Rob Mitchell, a spokesman for BMW. The German automaker has 
side air bags as a standard feature in the front seat of its autos, 
and they are offered as an option for rear seats on four-door 
models. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell said, however, that if parents ``can't guarantee that a  
child will be properly restrained'' in the back seat, for example 
in a child seat instead of sleeping against a door, ``that may be a 
concern.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before deciding to buy optional side air bags for the back seat,  
he said, ``It may be something you want to think about.''

<HEADLINE> Rockies' Walker Wants To Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- He strained a rib muscle hitting a  
batting-practice homer and came down with food poisoning eating a 
chicken dinner. It's been a rough week for Larry Walker. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, the reigning NL batting champion and 1997 league MVP,  
was feeling better Friday and remained optimistic he will be in 
right field when the Colorado Rockies open the season Sunday 
against the San Diego Padres at Monterrey, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I feel I'm playing Sunday,'' Walker said. ``Maybe  
that's looking a little too high and too confident, but I want to 
be in the opening-day lineup if I'm not going to go out there and 
jeopardize anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, 32, strained a muscle in his right rib cage while taking  
batting practice Tuesday. To make matters worse, he came down with 
food poisoning Wednesday night about three hours after eating 
dinner with his brother at a restaurant in Tucson, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	``It comes out of nowhere,'' Walker said. ``I felt great the  
whole night until, boom! I was done. The chicken was coming out 
with feathers, the beak, everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hampered by injuries throughout his career, Walker adopted a  
rigorous offseason workout program that helped him add muscle and 
shed 11 pounds. He was rewarded with a $75 million, six-year 
extension the day before Colorado's first spring training game. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker's medical history was a focal point of contract  
negotiations. He missed 32 games last season with a sore elbow and 
a sprained finger, and he has played more than 150 games in just 
one of his nine major league seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people just have great genetics,'' Walker said. ``I  
worked hard this winter to avoid things like this, yet it still 
seems to find me. Some guys are just blessed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because his rib injury has improved over the past three days,  
the Rockies have not decided whether to place Walker on the 15-day 
disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	``They talked about the DL and I didn't want to hear about it,  
so right now the DL's not an option for me unless I take a big back 
step on this,'' Walker said. ``The last few days, we've moved 
forward on it and it's felt better, so we'll see how we're doing a 
few days from now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Walker is unable to play, the Rockies can turn to Kurt  
Abbott, Lenny Harris, Pat Watkins or Angel Echevarria. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've thought about it a lot,'' Colorado manager Jim Leyland  
said after the Rockies exhibition game against Boston was canceled 
because of snow. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he wanted to share his lineup possibilities with  
reporters, Leyland shook his head. ``No.''

<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Former first lady Barbara Bush was released from  
a hospital, one day after undergoing back surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``It went very, very well. She's up walking around,'' former  
President George Bush said Thursday outside of Methodist Hospital. 
``The doctor's happy with it, and I'm happy with it. The doctors

	He declined to elaborate on his wife's condition, as did  
hospital officials.

quiet, but her husband made reference to the surgery Wednesday 
during a fund-raiser.

<HEADLINE> The Money's On Sosa and McGwire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Like Mark McGwire's chances of hitting at least  
61 home runs this season? 
</P>
<P>
	You can bet on it at several Las Vegas sports books, who figure  
both McGwire and Sammy Sosa will have big home run years once 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Las Vegas Hilton, bettors can put money on whether the  
Cardinals' slugger will hit more or less than 60 1/2 home runs this 
season. Sammy Sosa's over-under total is 53 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, McGwire broke the home run record with 70, while  
Sosa had 66. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire is a 4-5 favorite at the Hilton to win the home run race  
again, while Sosa is close behind at 8-5. Albert Belle is 5-2, 
while Ken Griffey Jr. is 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Imperial Palace, Belle has generated the most action so  
far, according to assistant sports book manager Kelly Downey. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been heavy betting on Belle,'' Downey said of the  
slugger now with the Baltimore Orioles. ``Everyone else's odds have 
gone up, while his have gone down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bettors can also wager on other baseball propositions, including  
Randy Johnson's chances to lead the majors in strikeouts (2-1) and 
Los Angeles Dodgers reliever Jeff Shaw as the favorite for most 
saves (7-2).

<HEADLINE> Shake, Rattle and Roll Writer Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALTAMONTE SPRINGS, Fla. (AP) -- Jesse Stone, a major influence on  
20th century music who wrote ``Shake, Rattle and Roll'' and helped 
develop many of Atlantic Records' biggest hits, has died. He was 
97. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone died Thursday after a long illness.  
</P>
<P>
	As a writer, producer and arranger at Atlantic, Stone worked  
with artists such as Ray Charles, Big Joe Turner, the Drifters and 
the Clovers. Among his other famous songs were ``Idaho'' and 
``Money Honey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1974, Atlantic Records President Ahmet Ertegun said: ``Jesse  
Stone did more to develop the basic rock 'n roll sound than anybody 
else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stone's widow, singer Evelyn McGee Stone, said that on March 27,  
the day her husband went into the hospital for the last time, he 
began writing a new song while she was playing with their dog. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had been saying to the dog, `That's it, that's it,' and he  
wrote a song and that's the title,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The grandson of Tennessee slaves, Stone had a career that  
spanned the spectrum: minstrels, folk songs, dance orchestras, 
rhythm and blues, rock 'n' roll and jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone always was on the cutting edge, never quite achieving fame  
but highly respected within the core of the profession. 
</P>
<P>
	He helped build Atlantic Records into a top rhythm-and-blues  
label in the late '40s and early '50s, signing such stars as Ruth 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her first record came out. Bang! It was a hit. We got a group  
called the Clovers. Their record came out. Bang! It was a hit,'' 
Stone said in a 1991 Associated Press interview. ``Everything we 
touched after that went over big. Sometimes we had four or five 
records on the chart at the same time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Stone and Bill Haley, who had a Top 10 hit in 1954 with  
Stone's ``Shake, Rattle and Roll,'' that paved the way for the 
acceptance among whites of what had been considered ``Negro 
music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A white man recording black music. That's when white people  
began to buy this stuff -- they could hear it on the air,'' Stone 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elvis Presley's nationwide success the following year cemented  
the R&AMP;B-rock foundation laid by black singers and Haley -- many with 
Stone's tunes and arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Stone's jazz tune ``Idaho'' helped make Guy Lombardo  
rich and famous, selling 3 million copies in the mid-1940s. Benny 
Goodman and Jimmy Dorsey also had a hit with it. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Atchison, Kan. on Nov. 16, 1901, Stone -- who also wrote  
under the name Charles Calhoun -- started performing at age 5, 
touring with his family's minstrel show. In the 1920s, he led a 
jazz group that included future saxophone legend Coleman Hawkins. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1936, Duke Ellington helped him get a booking at the Cotton  
Club in New York. He also worked at the Apollo Theater, composing 
and arranging songs as well as writing jokes and sketches. 
</P>
<P>
	He was inducted into the Rhythm 'n' Blues Hall of Fame in 1992.  
</P>
<P>
	At Stone's 95th birthday party, Ertegun read a letter from famed  
producer Jerry Wexler, noted: ``From your vast experience with 
jazz, blues, country -- in fact, every facet of American root music, 
you became one of the architects of the new urban music of black 
folk, the music that came to be known as rhythm and blues. You 
wrote the tunes and the arrangements; you assembled the players; 
you ran the rehearsals; you conducted in the studio. And it was 
your own continuing evolution that helped pave the way for the next 
great cultural tidal wave -- rock 'n' roll.''

<HEADLINE> Excellent Meeting Wins in Arkansas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOT SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) -- Excellent Meeting took the lead on the  
turn and defeated The Happy Hopper by 2 1/2 lengths in the $250,000 
Fantasy Stakes at Oaklawn Park on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fourth straight victory for the Bob Baffert-trained  
Excellent Meeting and her seventh in her last eight starts. Her 
only defeat during that time was by a half-length to 
Silverbulletday in the Breeder's Cup Juvenile Fillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Owned by Golden Eagle Farm, Excellent Meeting has been mentioned  
by Baffert as a Kentucky Derby possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Kent Desormeaux, Excellent Meeting covered 1 1-16  
miles in 1:42 3-5. 
</P>
<P>
	The favorite in a field of six returned $2.60, $2.40, $2.20. The  
Happy Hopper paid $3.60 and $2.20. Dreams Gallore was worth $2.20. 
</P>
<P>
	Excellent Meeting went by The Happy Hopper in the far turn and  
quickly opened daylight. Desormeaux whipped her five times on the 
right hip, glanced toward the rail at The Happy Hopper and popped 
his mount one more time for good measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Excellent Meeting had four firsts, three seconds and a third in  
eight starts as a 2-year-old. After the Breeders' Cup Juvenile 
Fillies, she came back with an eight-length victory in a stakes 
race at Hollywood Park. After a two-month layoff, she captured the 
Las Virgenes Stakes by four lengths. A month later, she was a neck 
winner in the Santa Anita Oaks.

<HEADLINE> Escrows for Internet Auctions? / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Several months ago, Bart Moccabee shelled out  
$560 for some computer hardware sold on an Internet auction, then 
eagerly awaited the merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	He waited, and waited some more -- hoping to use the  
microprocessor and memory boards he successfully bid on to build a 
personal computer -- but he never heard from the seller again. When 
he tried to e-mail that individual to track down his purchase, he 
found the address inactive. 
</P>
<P>
	He got stung.  
</P>
<P>
	Yet Moccabee, a 27-year-old technical support supervisor from  
Hilliard, Ohio, wasn't out a cent. Because the order was so big, he 
decided beforehand to place his payment with an online escrow 
service. The service, i-Escrow, which processes transactions on the 
eBay auction site, cheerfully refunded his money, along with a 5 
percent service fee he paid. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many other people got ripped off by this guy,'' said Moccabee,  
a frequent Internet shopper. ``If I buy anything else big, I'm 
going to use this (escrow service) again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Online sales between strangers require a considerable amount of  
trust, and lots of things can go wrong. As more people use the 
Internet to buy and sell everything from Beanie Babies to beach 
bungalows -- millions of online transactions take place each month -- 
an increasing number are turning to escrow services to facilitate 
the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For a fee, which varies according to purchase price, an escrow  
holder essentially acts as a middleman to ensure buyers put up 
their money and sellers deliver the goods as promised. Typically, 
money is placed in a bank escrow account until the buyers receive 
and inspect their purchases and approve the release of funds to the 
seller. The buyer and seller can negotiate who pays the escrow fee. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, in a worst-case scenario, you could end up with a  
game of chicken: The buyer wants to see the item before paying; the 
seller won't part with it until he's paid. So, now what? 
</P>
<P>
	``We're selling trust,'' said Ken Pereira, chief executive  
officer of 4-year-old TradeSafe Online Corp., in Providence, R.I. 
(www.tradesafe.com), one of the first Internet escrow services to 
be founded. 
</P>
<P>
	``People come to us after essentially enacting transactions.  
They don't want to put a $5,000 check in the mail for someone they 
don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other major escrow services include i-Escrow of San Mateo,  
Calif. (www.iescrow.com) and Trade-direct of Tampa, Fla. 
(www.trade-direct.com). Many have struck deals with online auction 
and classified ad companies like eBay, OnSale, city Auction and 
Recycler.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Auction Universe of New York (www.auctionuniverse.com)  
recently started its own in-house escrow service known as BidSafe. 
</P>
<P>
	All report a steady climb in business, especially in recent  
months as word continues to get out that such services are 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hasn't caught on in a big enough way yet, but the growth  
month-to-month has been tremendous -- between 20- and 30 percent (in 
sales),'' said Pereira, echoing the growth rates of other escrow 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The vast majority of Internet transactions do go off without a  
hitch, says eBay spokesman Kevin Pursglove. EBay, the largest of 
the Internet auction sites, has various safety measures already in 
place, like an online ``feedback'' system that shows performance 
records of buyers and sellers and a newly instituted insurance 
program that provides limited coverage for purchased items. 
</P>
<P>
	Pursglove says using an escrow service is an additional safety  
step which should be considered when buying expensive items. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're getting into an area where the bid is $700, $800,  
$900, you'd be wise to take this extra step,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Purchases involving escrows have ranged from as low as $10 to as  
high as $50,000, the companies report. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides providing peace of mind for both buyer and seller,  
escrow services also help speed up the transaction because they 
allow credit cards to be used. 
</P>
<P>
	Those using BidSafe, for example, can expect to receive their  
merchandise within five days if they charge their purchases, vs. 10 
to 15 days if they mail a personal check, says Bonnie Schwartz, a 
vice president at Auction Universe, and creator of the BidSafe 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Smith, 42, of Pulaski, Tenn., says that has made her  
online business run so much smoother. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have to go hunting around and matching up payments,''  
said Smith, who sells Beanie Babies, Furbies, sports cards and 
other collectibles on Internet auctions like Auction Universe. 
</P>
<P>
	The escrow services also track the shipping services that  
deliver the goods. Buyers, for instance, can go online and quickly 
find out the location of their merchandise at various stages. 
</P>
<P>
	I-Escrow President Sherman Kwok says most transactions proceed  
like clockwork, although in a small number of instances, both 
parties have had to renegotiate a price because an item wasn't 
quite what the buyer wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	So, what has been the most unusual purchase involving escrows?  
An Egyptian cat mummy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're keeping an eye on that one,'' said Kwok.

<HEADLINE> Employer Sued Over Voice-Mail Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A man has sued his employer for allegedly failing  
to secure the company voice mail system, even after he complained 
that someone had hacked into the system and was passing offensive 
messages about him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that this makes other companies look at their systems  
and say, `Gee, could this happen with our company?''' Gary Thompson 
said Thursday from his home in suburban Wheaton. ``I would be 
willing to bet most companies haven't even thought about this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson is suing both Jewel Food Stores and its parent,  
American Food Stores Co. He claims that on five occasions beginning 
in 1996 someone posing as a private investigator hired by the 
company left false and defamatory messages in the voice-mail boxes 
of hundreds of American Stores' employees nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The messages included claims that he had HIV, was a drug user,  
cheated on his wife with company secretaries and stole from the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started being treated differently immediately after the  
first message. Work associates stopped shaking my hand,'' said 
Thompson, 45, who is on disability leave after suffering what he 
described as severe depression. 
</P>
<P>
	One day Thompson found a note on the front seat of his car in  
which the author said they understood he was dying of AIDS and 
wanted to know how to apply for his reserved parking space. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those kinds of things start to build up and get to you,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the law has begun to adapt to issues of privacy and  
copyright infringement relating to the Internet and e-mail, voice 
mail has produced a similar set of concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson's lawsuit, filed in January in DuPage County Circuit  
Court, seeks in excess of $50,000 in damages and also names as a 
defendant ``John Doe,'' the unidentified person who allegedly 
obtained a distribution password enabling him to send the messages 
companywide. Thompson said he assumes the messenger is a former 
employee he may have dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	The company insists it reacted swiftly to Thompson's concerns.  
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the allegations are unfounded,'' said Karen  
Ramos, a spokeswoman for Jewel. ``The company took immediate and 
appropriate action in response to the unauthorized voice-mail 
messages in question.''

<HEADLINE> Yahoo! Reveals Internet Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The president of Yahoo! declared Thursday that  
three companies will dominate the Internet by the end of next year 
and his company aims to be one of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Mallett's bold call came as he announced that Yahoo!, the  
Internet's leading search and directory service, will pay $6.08 
billion buy Broadcast.com, the top provider of TV and radio 
programming on the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect three companies to emerge from the pack exiting the  
year 2000,'' Mallet said in an interview. And Yahoo!, Microsoft 
Network and America Online ``are clearly starting to separate 
themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To ensure Yahoo!'s position, Mallett said the company will  
continue to make acquisitions and expand in three key areas: media, 
communications, and direct services. 
</P>
<P>
	This is Yahoo!'s second major deal this year. In January, the  
Santa Clara, Calif.-based company announced it was buying GeoCities 
Inc., a Web service used by more than 3 million people to publish 
their writings, post their family photos or try to sell things. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile America Online, the largest Internet and online  
service, recently acquired the software company Netscape as it 
tries to dominate Web services for both individuals and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft is assembling a large array of Web services as well,  
including travel, car buying and entertainment listings. Its 
Microsoft Network online service is a rival to AOL although it has 
been far less successful. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to these powerful competitors, Mallett should be  
looking over his shoulder for several others. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T just bought the big cable TV company Tele-Communications  
Inc. and a stake in the high-speed Internet service provider AtHome 
Corp. -- moves that will make it a major force as consumers abandon 
slow-moving telephone hookups to the Net and switch to much faster 
cable TV links. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com is positioning itself as the Web's retailing leader.  
The online bookseller this week launched its own auction service 
and recently acquired stakes in Pets.com, a pet supplies retailer, 
and Drugstore.com, an online pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditional broadcasting companies like CBS and Disney's ABC are  
also hunting for Internet acquisitions. And, Cisco Systems, the 
computer networking equipment company, wants to replace the 
telephone with the computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Mallett ``is only talking about next year,'' said Jim  
Balderston, an industry analyst with Zona Research Inc. 
``Twenty-four to 36 months from now, the order could shift, and 
there could be newcomers, and the traditional media companies might 
come in dumping a boatload of cash and making their presences 
known.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Time is of the essence. The Internet industry is both expanding  
and consolidating at a rapid pace. New companies go public almost 
daily and quickly become targets or suitors in corporate takeovers. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the leading Web companies are looking for strategic  
acquisitions that reflect the integration of computer, television 
and telephone services with commerce, information and 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, many consumers haven't been able to keep up with the  
blurring changes of the Internet. Most home computers are still a 
few years away from having the high-speed access to make it easy to 
watch movies online. 
</P>
<P>
	But Todd Wagner, chief executive of Dallas-based Broadcast.com,  
said ``This is happening much more quickly than any of us ever 
anticipated.'' A few years ago, for example, audio on the Internet 
was full of static like an AM radio. Today, it's nearly CD quality, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcast.com's audio and video business is expected to take off  
as high-speed access to the Internet -- and a wealth of new services 
it brings -- becomes more prevalent in the home and office. 
</P>
<P>
	However, like most Internet companies, Broadcast.com makes no  
profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Still the 10 percent premium Yahoo! paid over the market price  
of its stock didn't bother investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``What else is new?,'' said Charles Lax, a general partner with  
SoftBank Venture Capital, Yahoo!'s biggest shareholder. 
``High-speed access (to the Internet) is very important, and this 
is just an anchor acquisition for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! stock rose $11.37 1/2 to $179.75 on the Nasdaq Stock Market,  
where Broadcast.com's shares rose $11.81 1/4 to $130. The stock 
movement upped the price of the deal from an initial value of $5.7 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	While it may be too early to call the winners in the Internet  
race, underestimating Yahoo! would be a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1994 by Stanford University doctoral candidates David  
Filo and Jerry Yang, Yahoo!'s turbocharged stock, which has risen 
264 percent in the past 12 months, has turned into a currency to 
snap up rivals.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Gov't. Gives Tax Rebates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- For once, Hong Kong residents are looking  
forward to getting mail from the tax department. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the government's efforts to stimulate this  
territory's shrinking economy, taxpayers in Hong Kong started 
getting checks this week equal to 10 percent of what they had paid 
for income and profit taxes for the fiscal year ended Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong's beleaguered retailers and restaurant owners are  
hoping the unprecedented rebate would give them a much-needed 
boost, but experts are divided how much good it will do. 
</P>
<P>
	From health clubs and department stores to drug stores, karaoke  
clubs and supermarkets, retailers are sporting signs of ``rebate 
discounts,'' hoping to get a share of the $1.1 billion that 
officials hope will be funneled back to the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong people have been lining up at banks all week to  
deposit their rebates, and merchants are doing their best to 
encourage them to spend freely. 
</P>
<P>
	With a copy of the rebate check, diners at Hsin Kuang  
restaurants can get can shark's fin soup with abalone, a pricey 
Chinese delicacy, for $16.40 -- a 35 percent discount. 
</P>
<P>
	But will the people spend? Some say they will but others are  
saving the cash out of fear that things could get worse. 
</P>
<P>
	A man outside a branch of Hongkong Bank, who identified himself  
only as P. Kok, said he would save most of his $897 rebate. 
``People don't spend when they think the economy will be weak for a 
while. They feel more comfortable with more cash in hand,'' said 
Kok, a government worker. 
</P>
<P>
	But Angel Yiu, a senior manager at National Mutual Investment  
Co., said it was her ``duty'' to spend all of her $3,846 rebate on 
new clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I support the government's call for consumers to spend our way  
out of the recession,'' she said. ``If we save our money, the 
economy will probably flounder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Retailers are hoping most Hong Kong people take Yiu's point of  
view. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a large sum for any economy. We shouldn't look at it as  
just 8.5 billion because the money spent ... will have a rippling 
effect throughout the economy,'' said Tommy Cheung, president of 
the Association of Restaurant Managers. 
</P>
<P>
	An anticipated mid-year spending spree could give restaurant  
owners ``the light at the end of the tunnel'' before the 
traditional year-end Christmas boom, Cheung said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong's once-robust retail business sank 16 percent and  
restaurants saw their business drop 12 percent last year, as the 
economy spiraled into the worst recession in a generation and

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Passenger Ferry Sinks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) -- Hundreds of people were missing today  
after a passenger ferry sank off Nigeria, news reports said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boat, which was believed to be carrying up to 300 people,  
sank late Thursday night about 70 miles off shore, the News Agency 
of Nigeria reported, quoting unnamed dock officials in the coastal 
city of Port Harcourt. 
</P>
<P>
	Two speedboats raced to the scene after word came in of the  
sinking, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Local journalists said about 25 survivors had been brought to  
Port Harcourt by this afternoon. Local officials were continuing to 
send out rescue boats. 
</P>
<P>
	While the ferry has a capacity of 150 passengers, it was  
believed to be overcrowded and as many as 300 people could have 
been on board when it sank, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ferry, the MV George, was heading for the town of Nembe,  
about 50 miles to the southwest. Most of the passengers were 
believed to be traders. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Port Harcourt and Nembe are in the swampy Niger delta  
region of southeastern Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
	River ferries, old and often in complete disrepair, ply the  
waters off Nigeria. Many are dangerously overcrowded.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Seeks Population Plan Finance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Delegates from more than 170 countries  
negotiating new proposals to slow global population growth must 
figure out a way to get participating nations to honor their 
financial pledges. 
</P>
<P>
	After two weeks of debate on proposals to implement a 20-year  
population program adopted at the U.N. conference in Cairo in 1994, 
delegates couldn't reach agreement on the financial plan by 
Thursday night's deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	The delegates suspended the meeting after completing two-thirds  
of the draft document and asked Bangladesh's U.N. Ambassador 
Anwarul Chowdhury, the session's chairman, to set a date for the 
meeting to resume. He said he was looking at dates in late May. 
</P>
<P>
	The new proposals are scheduled to be presented to a special  
General Assembly session from June 30 to July 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years ago, participating governments agreed to spend $17  
billion a year by 2000 to achieve the ambitious goals set out in 
Cairo, but that target is still a long way off. 
</P>
<P>
	Industrialized nations pledged to provide one third of the cash,  
or $5.7 billion per year. So far, however, they are providing just 
$1.4 billion annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, after lengthy negotiations, several key sections of  
the draft are still in dispute, including a call for laws punishing 
women who have undergone illegal abortions to be reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	Chowdhury and Dr. Nafis Sadik, executive director of the U.N.  
Population Fund, were optimistic that the disputes would be 
resolved during the next round of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chowdhury said there may not be consensus on money before  
the General Assembly session. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the five years since Cairo, we find that the developing  
countries have made their commitments, in terms of changing their 
politics and priorities and in terms of resource commitments -- so 
they have done their bit,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, it's time for the industrialized nations to follow suit,  
Chowdhury said. 
</P>
<P>
	The draft not only calls for industrialized nations to meet  
their Cairo commitments -- but to earmark a minimum of 5 percent of 
their foreign aid for population activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a major advancement to what's happening now,''  
Chowdhury said. ``We would like donors ... to accept the 
challenge.''

<HEADLINE> Poll: Fed Taxes Too Complicated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREDERICKSBURG, Va. (AP) -- The percentage of Americans who say  
federal taxes have gotten too complicated has increased 
significantly over the last three years to almost two-thirds, 
according to an Associated Press poll. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internal Revenue Service acknowledges that an array of new  
tax credits, deductions and other changes in the law has lengthened 
by several hours the time it takes to fill out an itemized tax 
return. 
</P>
<P>
	In a poll conducted for the AP by ICR of Media, Pa., 66 percent  
said the federal tax system is too complicated, while 28 percent 
said it's not. Three years ago, just under half in an AP poll said 
the tax system was too complicated. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of those surveyed, 56 percent, now pay someone  
else to do their taxes, while 40 percent said they do their taxes 
themselves, the poll indicated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the average taxpayer should have to ... deal  
with the expense of having somebody else do their taxes,'' said 
60-year old electrician John T. Adlon of Fredericksburg, a city in 
northern Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Just over half think a flat tax would be a more fair way to tax  
Americans, the poll suggested, while about four in 10 disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
	A third in the poll said they would be willing to give up some  
deductions to simplify the tax code. But people expecting refunds 
are less likely to want to do that. 
</P>
<P>
	Tax experts say the increasing number of people who have  
investments in the stock market has influenced the number who need 
professional tax help. 
</P>
<P>
	H&AMP;R Block, the nation's largest tax preparation business,  
reported this week that revenues rose almost 20 percent in the 
first quarter compared with the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The major concerns of people who call the company's offices are  
tax credits for children, tax credits for education and capital 
gains taxes, said Linda McDougall, a spokeswoman for the Kansas 
City, Mo., company. Most of the rise in revenues is linked to 
additional business, not fee increases, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The deadline for filing tax returns is April 15, unless  
taxpayers file an extension request. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has targeted its advertising at the growing  
confusion faced by the public with ads asking: ``We know, do you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS had to develop 11 new forms and revise 177 others just  
for last year as President Clinton and Congress pushed new tax 
credits for specific groups, changes in deductions and capital 
gains laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The complexity has driven Charles Embrey, a 40-year-old factory  
worker from Fredericksburg, to start paying for tax help in recent 
years. Replacing the current system of graduated taxes with a flat 
tax is a tempting way to make things easier, he said. But he fears 
a flat-tax system would be too easy on the rich. 
</P>
<P>
	``With my income, I don't prefer a flat tax,'' he said. ``They  
charge me one rate and somebody making $70,000 or $80,000 a year 
would pay the same rate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six out of 10 of those in the AP poll say they expect to get a  
refund, while just over a fourth say they must pay more than was 
taken out of their paychecks. A majority of both those who have to 
pay and those who are owed money by the IRS said the system is too 
complicated. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll of 1,012 people was taken March 26-30 and has an error  
margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a decade ago, the number who paid for tax help was a large  
portion of the population, but was still in the minority, said Pete 
Sepp, a spokesman for the National Taxpayers Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax system is likely to just keep getting more complex, said  
J.D. Foster, executive director of the Tax Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not much going on to go in the opposite direction,''  
Foster said, noting the growing popularity of computer tax 
preparation programs has helped some. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean MacDonald, a 29-year-old librarian from Bloomington, Ill.,  
and her sister, Maggie Bromenshenkel, a 34-year-old bank official 
from nearby Warrenton, complain the increasing tax credits are more 
political than helpful to them. They both want a simpler tax 
system, preferably a flat tax. 
</P>
<P>
	``We agree on something,'' Ms. Bromenshenkel exclaimed,  
laughing. ``We're sisters and we hardly ever agree on anything.''

	Clinton Still Says No to Troops  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says he plans to stay the  
course with NATO's current bombing strategy against Yugoslavia and 
will not authorize the use of ground troops. Clinton said the air 
attacks on Serb targets still have the power to return the ethnic 
Albanians to Kosovo. One refugee official said ``there are about 
900,000 Kosovar Albanians left'' from a population that originally 
totaled about 1.8 million. Clinton says it's become clear that 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic wants to keep the territory 
of Kosovo. The president also issued a warning to Milosevic, 
telling the Serb leader that he holds him personally responsible 
for the safety and well-being of three captured U.S. soldiers.

	Court Proceedings Begin in Yugoslavia

<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serb officials are reportedly  
gathering evidence for a trial against the three U.S. soldiers 
captured near the Yugoslavian border. It's not clear what the men 
might be charged with, but a Yugoslav lawyer said the soldiers 
could be charged with ``waging aggression,'' which carries a 
15-year prison term. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., says it would be a 
gross violation of the Geneva conventions if Yugoslavia proceeds 
with trials.

	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A man has been arrested by federal and  
state officials and charged with originating the e-mail virus known 
as Melissa. Authorities say David L. Smith originated the virus, 
which caused worldwide e-mail disruption this week, from his 
apartment in Aberdeen, N.J. Smith is charged with interfering with 
the public communication, which carries a sentence of five to 10 
years in prison and up to a $150,000 fine. He was released on 
$100,000 bail. Police say Smith was snared with the help of America 
Online technicians, and a computer task force composed of federal 
and state agents.

	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A jury has begun deliberating the  
sentence for a Marine aviator involved in a deadly accident at an 
Italian ski resort. Capt. Joseph Schweitzer pleaded guilty Monday 
to obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice for 
destroying a videotape made before the Feb. 3, 1998, accident near 
Cavalese, Italy. He was the navigator of the EA-6B Prowler that 
severed a ski lift cable, sending a gondola carrying 20 people 
crashing to the ground. All 20 were killed. Schweitzer could be 
sent to prison or kicked out of the Marines.

	Jr. Gotti Wants To Return to Jail  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Suspected crime family boss John A. ``Junior''  
Gotti has asked to be put back in jail because he cannot afford to 
pay for security guards hired to watch him. Gotti, the son of 
convicted murderer and racketeer John Gotti, faces his own federal 
racketeering trial in five days. He was released on $10 million 
bail in October under strict conditions, meaning he must wear an 
electronic ankle bracelet to track his movements, and he has to pay 
about $24,000 a month for security guards posted outside his house. 
Prosecutors allege Gotti, 35, acted as head of the Gambino crime 
family after his father was convicted of murder in 1992.

<TEXT>
<P>
	KUKES, Albania (AP) -- Serb forces are systematically rounding up  
ethnic Albanians, herding them into trains and other vehicles and 
transporting them to neighboring countries, U.N. and arriving 
refugees said. 
</P>
<P>
	The forced deportations are bringing Serbs closer to their goal  
of ridding Yugoslavia's Kosovo province of its ethnic Albanian 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Pristina, the provincial capital, has become a ghost town, said  
refugees arriving Thursday in Macedonia, Albania and Montenegro. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of the city were crammed onto a train and carried  
away, said Judith Kumin, a spokeswoman for the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 180,000 refugees have overwhelmed Macedonia, Albania  
and Montenegro since NATO airstrikes began March 24, U.N. spokesman 
Fred Eckhard said Thursday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Even that estimate may be outdated, said Kumin. ``Nobody knows  
how to count them any more,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two people died in overloaded trains arriving at the Macedonia  
border Thursday, refugees said. A 72-year-old man, Rexhep Liman, 
survived the trip to the frontier with three dozen other people in 
a tractor-drawn wagon, but died after spending his first night on 
the road in the rain. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was not sick, but it was very cold,'' said Skender Mauriqi,  
the tractor driver. ``We left Pristina at 1 p.m. yesterday. All the 
way, he kept saying that he wanted to go back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arrivals from Pristina tell the same story -- being dragged from  
their homes by Serb gunmen and herded onto a hillside in the 
diplomatic quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	A weeping elderly woman recounted how she and other people  
``were pushed, made to go faster and faster'' to get to the train. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said they will kill us and the older people unless we  
moved faster,'' she said. ``Oh my God, what have they done?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mauriqi said he counted about 15 dead in his street, including  
the body of a 17-year-old. ``I know his father,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said some of his Serb neighbors cried to see them leave.  
</P>
<P>
	``One Serb who lived near the mosque came out begging the  
soldiers not to kick us out, but they were shooting in the air, 
just like in Hitler's time,'' he said. ``I never thought I would 
live long enough to see this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Between the Albanian border crossing at Morini and the nearby  
town of Kukes, at least 350 cars packed with people waited on the 
road. The cars had been stripped of their license plates by Serb 
border guards. One car had a wheelchair tied to the roof. 
</P>
<P>
	Other refugees were jammed tightly in Albanian military  
transport trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	At Blace, the border crossing near the Macedonian capital  
Skopje, thousands of people streamed down the railroad tracks 
through the no-man's land separating Yugoslavia and Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	International organizations have rushed to get more supplies to  
the refugees, while Western European nations who met in an 
emergency conference in Bonn, Germany, promised more aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S.-based AmeriCares disaster relief organization announced  
it flew a plane Thursday to Skopje with medical supplies. It was 
planning four more flights in the coming week. 
</P>
<P>
	Some fleeing refugees had no alternative but to walk. Women and  
children said they left men behind in the mountains on their 
two-day trek to Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were afraid to come with us. They are hiding all over,''  
said Bukurie Morina. ``When the Serbs find men, they arrest them.''

<HEADLINE> Hawks' Steve Smith on Injured List </HEADLINE>

<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Hawks placed guard Steve Smith on the  
injured list Friday because of a sprained left knee.

<P>
	Smith injured the knee Thursday in a second-quarter collision  
with New Jersey Nets forward Keith Van Horn. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith will likely be out of action 7-10 days, Hawks spokesman  
Arthur Triche said. However, the Hawks chose not to replace Smith 
on the roster, meaning he won't have to sit out the mandatory five 
games if he recovers early.

<HEADLINE> Mass. Gov. Undergoes Heart Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

	WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) -- Gov. Paul Cellucci was resting today  
after undergoing an angioplasty, a procedure meant to widen an 
artery on the surface of his heart. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor's narrowed artery never posed a serious danger to  
his health and the surgery was not a medical necessity, doctors 
said. Cellucci, 50, had experienced occasional tightness in his 
chest while exercising and the operation was done to allow him to 
exercise at a greater intensity.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets ended the week mixed  
Friday, with the key index slipping in Tokyo but surging in Taipei. 
Many other bourses were closed for the Easter holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 37.37 points,  
or 0.23 percent, closing at 16,290.19 points. On Thursday, the 
average surged 490.97 points, or 3.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Export-oriented blue chips were among Friday's gainers, while  
some investors took profits by selling issues of other companies, 
including banks and telecommunications, which have recently led the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Tokyo were also hurt by lethargic trade as many  
foreign investors were away for the Easter holidays and because 
dealers remained reluctant to take positions before Monday's 
announcement of the Bank of Japan's quarterly ``tankan'' survey of 
business sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which marked the 50th  
anniversary of its founding on Thursday, held a small ceremony 
Friday morning at the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at the ceremony, Bank of Japan Governor Masaru Hayami  
said that the central bank is maintaining a very easy monetary 
stance to help support the nation's struggling economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 120.66 yen in the late  
afternoon, up 2.14 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also above 
its late New York level of 120.43 overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan shares soared, with the key index rising 3.0 percent as  
investors bought blue-chip stocks on optimism that the island's 
economy is on the mend. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally that began late in Thursday's session was well  
supported by foreign investors, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taipei exchange's Weighted Stock Price Index rose 213.83  
points to 7,232.51. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices on the Seoul Stock Exchange closed generally mixed,  
but the key index rose on buying from local institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 9.89 points, or 1.6  
percent, to 646.78. 
</P>
<P>
	Thai share prices closed mixed in very quiet trading, The Stock  
Exchange of Thailand index edged up 0.25 point to 357.10. 
</P>
<P>
	The markets were closed for the Easter holidays in Singapore,  
Indonesia, New Zealand, Australia and Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Macartney Wins NorAm Super-G </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEND, Ore. (AP) -- Scott Macartney of Redmond, Wash., won the  
final NorAm Cup super-G race of the season Friday, clinching the 
men's title as he led a 1-2-3-4 sweep by U.S. skiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Alison Powers of Fraser, Colo., won the women's overall and  
super-G crowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Macartney, a Dartmouth College sophomore who won the bronze  
medal in downhill in the 1998 World Junior Championships, captured 
his second NorAm win of the season in 1 minute, 13.10 seconds at 
Mount Bachelor Resort. Thomas Vonn of Newburgh, N.Y., was runnerup 
in 1:13.21 with Jakub Fiala of Breckenridge, Colo., third and Marco 
Sullivan of Tahoe City, Calif., fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian Jeff Durand, the NorAm downhill champion and the only  
skier who could overtake Macartney in super-G points, finished 
fifth. He had three super-G wins and 345 points while Macartney 
finished with 440. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's race, Anne Lefrancois of Canada was first in  
1:13.39 and Emily Brydon was second in 1:14.24. Kjersti Bjorn-Roli 
of Anchorage, Alaska, was the top American, third in 1:14.67. 
</P>
<P>
	Powers, who won two super-Gs during the season plus the downhill  
bronze medal in the 1999 World Junior Championships, finished 
seventh but that was more than enough to give her the title when 
Sara-Maude Boucher of Canada was 17th. Powers has 752 points, half 
of them in super-G, with Lefrancois overall runnerup at 648. 
</P>
<P>
	The NorAm Cup races, the highest Alpine development-level races  
in North America, conclude Saturday with men's and women's slaloms.

<HEADLINE> NY Police Beating Case Move Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal judge in the Abner Louima police  
brutality trial refused defense requests today to delay the trial 
and to dismiss an initial jury pool of 785 people. 
</P>
<P>
	``There must be 18 people among 785 who will be fair and  
impartial,'' said Judge Eugene Nickerson, who must select 12 jurors 
and six alternates. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Joseph Tacopina argued that at least four  
months were necessary to allow prejudicial pretrial publicity in 
this case ``and to the issue of police brutality generally, to 
abate.'' He cited recent news coverage of the police shooting death 
of African immigrant Amadou Diallo. 
</P>
<P>
	Nickerson denied the request without comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys also argued that the entire jury pool was  
tainted because reporters interviewed some candidates. Nickerson 
said those candidates would be dismissed. The judge later banned 
people from interviewing or identifying prospective jurors.

<HEADLINE> Collapsed Lung Sidelines Lindros </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia Flyers center Eric Lindros will  
sit out the remainder of the regular season because of a collapsed 
right lung, the team announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros apparently was hurt when cross-checked during the  
Flyers' game at Nashville on Thursday, team president and general 
manager Bob Clarke said. Television replays also showed Lindros 
falling on his stick in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly three quarts of blood filled into the space where the  
lung collapsed, and doctors at Baptist Hospital in Nashville were 
draining the blood out with a chest tube, the team said. Flyers 
team physician Dr. Gary Dorshimer said doctors in Nashville 
inserted a vacuum pump in the lung to help re-expand it. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorshimer said Lindros would be in Nashville for at least  
another two or three days. His status for the postseason will be 
determined when he returns to Philadelphia, Dorshimer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Listening to Dr. Dorshimer and after talking to the doctors in  
Nashville, this is a serious injury,'' Clarke said. ``The players' 
health is of major concern to us. We won't be playing him until all 
doctors are very confident that his health is fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros spoke with reporters in the dressing room for several  
minutes following the Flyers' 2-1 victory over the Predators on 
Thursday night and did not appear to be in pain. He awoke Friday 
morning with chest pain and went to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorshimer said Lindros was in stable condition and resting  
comfortably Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was checked in the ribs on the right side. He either  
suffered a rib fracture, or there was enough force with the sudden 
impact trauma that it caused a small microtear in the lung,'' 
Dorshimer said. ``That cause the lung to collapse and blood to fill 
in the space.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dorshimer said it would be at least seven days before doctors  
could determine the length of Lindros' recovery period and whether 
he would be healthy enough to play should the Flyers make the 
playoffs. Philadelphia is tied with Pittsburgh for second place in 
the Atlantic Division with seven games remaining in the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros' recovery should be aided, though, because he is in  
``peak physical condition,'' Dorshimer added. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Lindros, Eric's father and agent, did not immediately  
return a telephone message seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Lindros' first game following a two-game suspension for  
high-sticking and cutting Petr Nedved of the New York Rangers 
during Philadelphia's 3-1 victory Saturday. He missed two other 
games this season because of a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss was a blow to the Flyers, who already are without top  
defenseman Eric Desjardins. Lindros leads the Flyers with 40 goals 
and 93 points in 71 games. They are 1-1-2 without him this season 
and 44-47-11 during his career with the Flyers.

<HEADLINE> Chip-Makers Feel Economic Pinch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) -- Worldwide shipments of equipment  
used to make computer chips fell 21 percent last year due to the 
Asian slowdown and an oversupply of smaller wafers and a delay in 
making the transition to larger wafers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The totals for 1998 confirm what we knew and felt all year.  
1998 was a tough year,'' said Stanley T. Myers, president of 
Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International. 
</P>
<P>
	SEMI represents the businesses that manufacture the equipment  
used to make computer chips. Although the products of the 
semiconductor equipment market are somewhat obscure -- plasma etch 
processing chambers, aluminum low pressure seed sources, wafer 
defect detection tools and more -- they are crucial to supplying key 
products for the Information Age. 
</P>
<P>
	SEMI reported this week that last year, semiconductor equipment  
shipments totaled $21.8 billion, down from the $27.6 billion in 
sales posted in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asian markets bore a larger portion of the industry  
downturn, reflecting last year's financial difficulties. Total 
semiconductor equipment sales in Korea declined to $1.3 billion, 
down 51 percent from 1997. Shipments in Japan reached $4.7 billion, 
down 31 percent. The rapid growth of the Taiwan market did carry 
over somewhat into 1998, with sales reaching $3.3 billion, down 14 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Myers said most segments seemed to hit their low point late in  
the third quarter and have been steadily improving since. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's a silver lining, it's that the industry ended 1998  
on an up note and now appears to be stabilizing and headed towards 
recovery,'' said Myers. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts agree. ``We are in the foothills of a long period of  
growth lasting until 2002,'' said to Jean-Philippe Dauvin, chief 
economist for STMicroelectronics. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that although 1998 was tough, ``there is a long way to  
grow before we reach maturity'' in the semiconductor device 
industry.

<HEADLINE>  Family, Friends Pray for Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	With bright yellow ribbons newly laced across their hometowns,  
relatives and friends of three U.S. servicemen facing trial in 
war-torn Yugoslavia wept and prayed for their safe return. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslavia said the men were invaders and would be tried today  
as criminals before a military court, despite demands from 
President Clinton that the soldiers be released. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is devastated. We're just praying to God he'll come  
out all right,'' said Frank Jasso, great-uncle of captive Staff 
Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles, Spc. Steven M. Gonzales, 21, of  
Huntsville, Texas, and Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, of 
Smiths Creek, Mich., were captured Wednesday near the 
Yugoslav-Macedonian border. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Stone learned his son had been taken by Yugoslav forces when  
a National Guard officer knocked on his door to deliver the news. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chris is a very special American and an incredibly proud  
soldier and we are very proud of him,'' Stone said, his voice 
breaking with emotion. 
</P>
<P>
	As U.S. networks showed Serb television images of the three men,  
relatives and friends strung yellow ribbons -- symbols of families 
waiting for soldiers to return from war -- all around their 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we saw him on TV it was a great relief, but of course we  
realize he's in a bad situation,'' said Gonzales' mother, Rosie. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steven and the two other soldiers are not criminals and should  
not be dealt with as criminals,'' she said. ``They are innocent 
young men over there as part of their duty to their country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Gonzales appeared battered and bruised, his family  
expressed relief he didn't look worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're dealing with it as best we can,'' said his father,  
Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzales was described as a likable, bright athlete during his  
high school days in Palestine, 90 miles north of Huntsville in east 
Texas. He graduated in 1995 and won a scholarship to Texas A&AMP;M, but 
left after a year to pursue a dream of joining an elite Army corps. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the type of student you'd love to have: hard-working,  
always happy, funny,'' said teacher Kay Stroud, who had Gonzales in 
her advanced placement biology class. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone, whose wife, Tricia, and 4-year-old son Ryan live in San  
Antonio, was described as a talented athlete also blessed with the 
``gift of gab.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm surprised he couldn't talk his way out of this,'' said Ken  
Marzka, Stone's cross-country coach at Capac Community 
Junior-Senior High School, about 50 miles northeast of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chris is a tough kid ... he never quit,'' Marzka said. ``Chris  
is going to be just fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	School counselor Kathy Kish said Stone was well-liked by  
students and teachers. He was a member of Students Against Drunk 
Driving. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't surprise us a bit that he's serving our country on  
a peace mission,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Los Angeles, outside the home of Ramirez's father, neighbors  
prayed for the captured staff sergeant and reminisced about the 
``all-American kid'' they watched grow up. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez, a wrestler in high school, joined the Army after  
graduation in 1992. He wanted to follow the path of his hero, older 
brother Steven, an Army veteran who is now a Los Angeles police 
detective. 
</P>
<P>
	The detective did not speak publicly, but did talk to police  
Cmdr. David Kalish. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very worried,'' Kalish said. ``He told me that his little  
brother is a very brave soldier and he's confident that he will be 
strong through this entire ordeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some neighbors wept as they talked outside the Ramirez home.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's a hero now because he did his duty as a military  
personnel,'' said neighbor and longtime friend Johnny Rios. ``We 
just thank God for putting him in our lives to serve the country.''

<HEADLINE> US, Canada Fishermen Fight Drilling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Fishermen are fighting a bid by energy companies  
to open drilling areas on the Canadian-controlled portion of 
Georges Bank off the upper East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The fishermen, from the United States and Canada, fear the  
fragile spawning ground, already depleted, could be destroyed with 
one oil spill or natural gas leak. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's 12-year moratorium on drilling in Georges Bank -- an  
area in the Atlantic that extends from Nova Scotia to Cape Cod -- is 
set to expire by 2000, and a provincial panel is considering 
whether to lift the moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
	Three energy companies -- Chevron, Amoco and Texaco -- have  
proposed drilling in the fingertip of the bank, located off the 
coast of Nova Scotia, according to the Canadian Association of 
Petroleum Producers. 
</P>
<P>
	But U.S. fishermen this week said the proposed drilling could  
hurt the whole fishery, which is worth about $100 million annually 
to southwest Nova Scotia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The environmental conditions in Georges Bank would make it  
difficult for crews to clean up an oil spill or a gas leak,'' said 
David Lincoln, an environmental consultant for a group of fishermen 
in New England. ``There are high winds, constant storms and 
extremely strong currents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Derek Wells, a spokesman for Canadian fishermen opposed to  
drilling, said government officials should prolong the ban. ``The 
U.S. has extended the moratorium until 2012 and Canada should do no 
less,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Texaco said the company has operated safely in  
many sensitive areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that Texaco, along with the oil and gas industry,  
believes exploration and production can be done without 
compromising the environment,'' said Paul Weeditz.

<HEADLINE> Gas Hike Hits California Hard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Angry Californians are digging deeper and  
deeper into their wallets to pay for a gallon of gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't afford these prices when every dollar counts,''  
complained Kristina Whelan, a 19-year-old Spanish literature 
student at the University of California, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It angers me,'' added Robert Sumber, 39, who was filling up a  
car Thursday instead of his gas-guzzling pickup truck. ``You need 
to drive here. What can you do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Californians are paying an average of $1.46 for a gallon of  
regular gas, up from $1.12 just a month ago, said Aileen Bohn, a 
spokeswoman for the Washington-based Energy Information 
Administration. The nationwide average is $1.08 per gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices across the country have jumped since the Organization of  
the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, announced production 
cuts to boost sagging oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's most populous state has been particularly hard hit.  
Fires at two California refineries cut into supplies, and a state 
decision to phase out an additive designed to make gas burn cleaner 
because of safety concerns could be costly. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's a state levy of 18 cents per gallon added to a 7.25  
percent sales tax, some of the highest fees in the nation. 
Motorists already pay 18.4 cents per gallon in federal taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	One California group is calling for government intervention. An  
Internet drive is pushing for a one-day boycott. And drivers are 
voicing their disgust. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the parents are expressing the anger because they are  
now having to decide, make a choice between purchasing gasoline and 
milk,'' said the Rev. Lowe Barry, a community activist. ``Gas is 
nearly $2 a gallon and milk is at least $3.50 a gallon.''

<P>
	The anger has surfaced on the Internet, too. A chain e-mail was  
making the rounds of office computer terminals, calling on 
Californians not to buy gas April 30. ``Let's have a GAS OUT!'' it 
read. 
</P>
<P>
	The crisis is not limited to Los Angeles, where mass transit is  
largely a mirage. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Asmann, owner of two Exxon stations in Pleasanton, a city  
of 60,000 in the eastern San Francisco Bay area, raised prices an 
average of 12 cents a gallon Wednesday. Premium was going for 
$1.99.9. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've ordered the number 2 for my signs,'' he said. ``I never  
thought I'd have to use them, but now I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six weeks ago, it was possible to find 99-cent gas in San Jose.  
With the hikes, some stations were selling gas for $1.61 a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will be a long time before we see 99-cent gas  
again,'' said Jerry Cummings, co-owner of a company that owns 
Rotten Robbie stations.

<HEADLINE> Minority Admissions Up at Cal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- The number of black and Hispanic  
students admitted to the University of California rebounded in the 
second year without affirmative action, an increase credited to 
strong recruitment and a more comprehensive application review. 
</P>
<P>
	Figures released Friday show the number of underrepresented  
minorities -- blacks, Hispanics and American Indians -- admitted to 
all eight undergraduate campuses this fall is only 27 students 
short of the number admitted in fall 1997, the last year race could 
be considered. 
</P>
<P>
	``The gloom and doom that was being preached by the proponents  
of preferences was grossly premature,'' said Ward Connerly, a 
member of the Board of Regents who led the fight to stop 
considering race in admissions. 
</P>
<P>
	Connerly said the figures vindicate his argument that the old  
system of affirmative action didn't do much more than create 
ill-will. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been saying that we need a new paradigm about affirmative  
action and that's really where we're headed,'' he said. 
``Everybody's looking at California to see how we can come up with 
a new concept of affirmative action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But affirmative action supporter Pedro Noguera, an ethnic  
studies professor at Berkeley, viewed the numbers slightly 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
	``It tells me that the university, the admissions office in  
particular, has been working hard at getting students to apply,'' 
he said. ``I think they're still working against the damage which 
was done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, admissions of underrepresented minorities dropped 61  
percent at Berkeley and 36 percent at UCLA. Other campuses had 
smaller declines, and some even posted slight increases, so the 
system-wide total was a less dramatic drop of about 9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Berkeley, which turned away about three of every four  
applicants, admitted 29 percent more underrepresented minorities 
than last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Berkeley took a more detailed approach to admissions, looking at  
such things as parental education and income levels, how the 
student did in comparison to others in his high school and how many 
honors courses the students took compared to how many were offered. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking at all eight undergraduate campuses, Hispanic admissions  
increased considerably this year, actually surpassing 1997 levels 
by 2 percent (5,622 to 5,753) while the numbers of American Indian 
and black students were higher than 1998 but still below 1997 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the improvement, Noguera said the figures don't come  
close to reflecting California's racial makeup. Hispanics, for 
example, comprise 29 percent of the state population but only 12 
percent of fall 1999 admissions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a long way to go,'' Noguera said.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Finish Mixed / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen today and a top  
official of Japan's Finance Ministry renewed pressure against the 
Japanese currency's rise. Japanese stocks turned mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.66 yen in the late afternoon, up 2.14 yen  
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level 
of 120.43 overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 37.37 points, or 0.23  
percent, closing the week at 16,290.19 points. On Thursday, the 
average advanced 490.97 points, or 3.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar moved higher against the yen on  
good buying by U.S. banks at around 120.50 yen, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The greenback's strength also derived from remarks by Haruhiko  
Kuroda, a senior official at Japan's Finance Ministry, who 
reiterated the ministry's stance that excessive yen strength is 
undesirable. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuroda, director-general of the ministry's international bureau,  
spoke to a small group of reporters without specifying an 
appropriate level for the currency. 
</P>
<P>
	A higher yen tends to make Japanese exports more expenses  
aboard, and thus less competitive, cutting into earnings of 
export-oriented Japanese companies. Japan is struggling to bail 
itself out of its worst recessions since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade remained thin ahead of the weekend and holidays in Europe  
and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 120.41 yen and 120.88 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro was traded at 130.02 yen, up from 128.42 yen  
late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, export-oriented blue chips were among  
today's gainers, while some investors took profits by selling 
issues of other companies, including banks and telecommunications, 
which have recently led the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices were also hurt by lethargic trade as many foreign  
investors were away for the Easter holidays and because dealers 
remained reluctant to take positions before Monday's announcement 
of the Bank of Japan's quarterly ``tankan'' survey of business 
sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was fairly active, with about 614 million shares  
changing hands on the exchange's first section, compared with 
Thursday's turnover of 726 million shares. Declines outnumbered 
advancers 614 to 601, with 108 issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section gained 3.73 points, or 0.29 percent, to 1,304.17. The 
TOPIX rose 33.22 points, or 2.6 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which marked the 50th  
anniversary of its founding on Thursday, held a small ceremony 
today morning at the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at the ceremony, Bank of Japan Governor Masaru Hayami  
said that the central bank is maintaining a very easy monetary 
stance to help support the nation's struggling economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 211 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.740 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.720 percent, 
driving its price down to 100.51 yen from 100.69 yen.

<HEADLINE> Arco Finds Put Alaska on Oil Map </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- When Richfield Oil Corp. arrived in  
Alaska, the only locally produced oil came from fish. 
</P>
<P>
	The year was 1955, and Alaska was still a federal territory  
fighting to become a state. Opposition to statehood was strong in 
Washington, D.C., largely because it wasn't clear that sprawling, 
thinly populated Alaska could support itself. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1957, Richfield's first Alaska well was in the Cook Inlet  
area, and it came in as a gusher. The worry about self-sufficiency 
ebbed, and the following year Congress voted overwhelmingly to make 
Alaska the 49th state. 
</P>
<P>
	The success at Swanson River marked the beginning of a  
four-decade relationship that produced huge riches for both the 
state and the company, whose name had been changed to Atlantic 
Richfield Co. when it discovered the real bonanza -- Prudhoe Bay, 
the largest oil field ever found in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could say Alaska made Arco, and Arco certainly had a  
pervasive impact on the state,'' said Gil Mull, a former Richfield 
geologist. 
</P>
<P>
	Those heady days are long gone for Arco, and soon its name will  
be, too. The company, pounded hard by prolonged low prices, was 
swallowed by BP Amoco PLC this week for $25.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which still must be approved by regulators, won't be  
final until the end of the year. In the meantime, Arco will 
continue as its own company, but in the minds of former workers and 
others in Alaska, the obituary has already been printed. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us feel some loss,'' said Harold Heinze, a former Arco  
president in Alaska. ``Though I probably feel a little more for the 
current employees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're losing a hell of a friend,'' said former Gov. Walter  
Hickel. 
</P>
<P>
	Losing Arco would leave BP Amoco as the only company operating  
on the North Slope, which accounts for more than one-sixth of the 
nation's oil production. BP Amoco would control more than 70 
percent of Alaska's crude output, and have a similar stake in the 
800-mile trans-Alaska oil pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco now pumps far more oil off the North Slope, but Arco  
was seen as having the better prospects by virtue of being a more 
vigorous explorer. 
</P>
<P>
	What worries some in oil-dependent Alaska is that the loss of  
Arco as a North Slope competitor could mean less hunting for new 
fields there. 
</P>
<P>
	``BP has always gone for the elephants,'' said Jack Roderick,  
whose book ``Crude Dreams'' chronicled Alaska's oil history. ``Do 
they have the incentive to move out from what they know? They 
haven't done it yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``BP has not been the real aggressive organization in frontier  
exploration,'' said Mull, who now works for the state. ``Most of 
the major discoveries, I think, are made by smaller companies 
willing to step out and do outrageous things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outrageous would describe Arco's devotion to the North Slope in  
the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	The region's geology had attracted a lot of interest, but no one  
could find any oil -- more than a dozen expensive holes were 
drilled, and every one of them dry. 
</P>
<P>
	Cash-strapped Richfield was getting ready to join the corporate  
exodus in the spring of 1967. But the company decided to drill one 
more well at an obscure place called Prudhoe Bay, and ended up 
driving the bit down into an oil reservoir that has so far yielded 
more than 10 billion barrels of crude. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this had been a dry hole, the North Slope would have been  
dead for a few years,'' said retired Arco geologist Marvin Mangus, 
who helped choose the Prudhoe Bay drill site. ``Maybe it would 
still be dead.'' BP was among those ready to pack it in when Arco 
drilled the Prudhoe Bay discovery well. Arco had offered to buy its 
Prudhoe acreage for a good price, but apparently pushed a little 
too hard to close the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	A suspicious BP held out and soon came news of the discovery. It  
started drilling wells and, as luck would have it, the largest 
share of the oil lay under its land.

<HEADLINE>  Stewart Leaves as Missouri Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- Norm Stewart recently said he wanted to  
coach another half-dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he ended a 32-year run at Missouri that produced 634  
victories when he announced his retirement Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	There was speculation that he was pushed out the door by new  
athletic director Mike Alden, who's been at the school only eight 
months, but Stewart said it was his call. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the inspiration came during a game at Kansas in January  
and a familiar chant from Jayhawks fans, ``Sit down, Norm!'' took 
on an entirely different meaning. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know what I said to myself that day? `I think I will,' ''  
Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
	From then on, although he never let on to players or  
administration, Stewart said there was no turning back. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't always make all the right decisions, and you can't  
coach a perfect game,'' Stewart said. ``So you make the decision 
and that's it. I got to make mine. I wish more people in this 
profession got to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart will serve the last four years of his contract as a  
special assistant to the school's chancellor. If there are any hard 
feelings, it was tough to tell as Stewart and Alden shared the 
podium at a center-court news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was in such a light-hearted mood that when he received a  
standing ovation from several hundred fans and players -- past and 
present -- in attendance, he asked if it had been timed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've decided not to coach at Missouri, in basketball or in any  
other sport,'' Stewart said. ``I came to Missouri a young man and 
I'm leaving a young man. Everybody has been really nice and good to 
work with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alden said he was shocked when the coach brought up retirement  
for the first time on March 15, three days after Missouri was 
eliminated by New Mexico in the first round of the NCAA tournament, 
in what he thought would be a typical end-of-season review. He said 
Stewart reiterated his desire to step down the following day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked him, are you sure?'' Alden said. ``He said he had  
decided what he wanted to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players weren't notified until Wednesday, more than two weeks  
after the meeting. They, too, were shocked. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was getting ready for class and my mom called me and she was  
like `Tell me the scoop, tell me the scoop,''' sophomore forward 
Johnnie Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Presumably, Stewart had earned the right to orchestrate his  
departure. He leaves with an impressive resume, at least from a 
numbers standpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	-- He's the third-winningest active coach with 731 victories,  
trailing only James Phelan of Mount St. Mary's (800) and Bobby 
Knight of Indiana (742), and he's seventh on the career list. 
</P>
<P>
	-- He averaged 19 victories a season at Missouri, and as player,  
assistant coach and head coach was involved in more than half 
(1,127) of the 2,151 games ever played at the school. 
</P>
<P>
	-- He bounced back from colon cancer in 1989 and NCAA probation  
in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	-- He produced an undefeated conference champion in 1993-94, a  
team that included zero future NBA stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart also leaves the program in good shape, with three  
starters back and two others with significant experience. That's a 
huge difference from his arrival in 1967, when Missouri totaled six 
victories in 49 games the previous two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I got here there wasn't much springboard,'' Stewart said.  
``There wasn't any pool, there wasn't any water. If you jumped in, 
you had problems. There's a better springboard now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, Missouri hasn't had much success in the  
postseason with a succession of first-round upsets to lightly 
regarded opponents that began in the late 1980s. Missouri missed 
the NCAAs for three years beginning in 1995-96, going a combined 
51-47, before ending that drought this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's Missouri teams twice made it to the final eight, in  
1976 and 1994, but never to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement also came amid reports of a falling-out between  
Stewart and Alden, who wasn't happy with Stewart's lack of response 
last week when junior Albert White announced he wanted to jump to 
the NBA, and of repeated problems with players. Nine players have 
transferred in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight of Stewart's current players attended the news conference,  
and the group did not include White or freshman point guard Keyon 
Dooling, who quarreled with Stewart during a game at Colorado in 
January. Stewart said the reason for the no-shows was he told them 
to attend class. 
</P>
<P>
	Dooling downplayed talk that he and fellow freshman guard  
Clarence Gilbert, a former high school teammate in Fort Lauderdale, 
Fla., might have transferred if Stewart stayed. Gilbert was another 
news conference no-show. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't nothing like that,'' Dooling said. ``From what I  
know, Coach made his decision a long time ago. It really had 
nothing to do with us. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was somewhat of a roller coaster, but it's all good. I mean  
it. I respect him a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alden said he has no short list of candidates in mind to succeed  
Stewart. Possible candidates include Duke assistant Quin Snyder, 
Bob Bender of Washington and longtime Missouri assistant Kim 
Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I would be interested,'' Anderson said. ``As time goes  
on, we'll see what happens.''

like `Tell me the scoop, tell me the scoop,''' sophomore forward 
Johnnie Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Presumably, Stewart had earned the right to orchestrate his  
departure. He leaves with an impressive resume, at least from a 
numbers standpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	-- He's the third-winningest active coach with 731 victories,  
trailing only James Phelan of Mount St. Mary's (800) and Bobby 
Knight of Indiana (742), and he's seventh on the career list. 
</P>
<P>
	-- He averaged 19 victories a season at Missouri, and as player,  
assistant coach and head coach was involved in more than half 
(1,127) of the 2,151 games ever played at the school. 
</P>
<P>
	-- He bounced back from colon cancer in 1989 and NCAA probation  
in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	-- He produced an undefeated conference champion in 1993-94, a  
team that included zero future NBA stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart also leaves the program in good shape, with three  
starters back and two others with significant experience. That's a 
huge difference from his arrival in 1967, when Missouri totaled six 
victories in 49 games the previous two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I got here there wasn't much springboard,'' Stewart said.  
``There wasn't any pool, there wasn't any water. If you jumped in, 
you had problems. There's a better springboard now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, Missouri hasn't had much success in the  
postseason with a succession of first-round upsets to lightly 
regarded opponents that began in the late 1980s. Missouri missed 
the NCAAs for three years beginning in 1995-96, going a combined 
51-47, before ending that drought this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's Missouri teams twice made it to the final eight, in  
1976 and 1994, but never to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement also came amid reports of a falling-out between  
Stewart and Alden, who wasn't happy with Stewart's lack of response 
last week when junior Albert White announced he wanted to jump to 
the NBA, and of repeated problems with players. Nine players have 
transferred in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight of Stewart's current players attended the news conference,  
and the group did not include White or freshman point guard Keyon 
Dooling, who quarreled with Stewart during a game at Colorado in 
January. Stewart said the reason for the no-shows was he told them 
to attend class. 
</P>
<P>
	Dooling downplayed talk that he and fellow freshman guard  
Clarence Gilbert, a former high school teammate in Fort Lauderdale, 
Fla., might have transferred if Stewart stayed. Gilbert was another 
news conference no-show. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't nothing like that,'' Dooling said. ``From what I  
know, Coach made his decision a long time ago. It really had 
nothing to do with us. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was somewhat of a roller coaster, but it's all good. I mean  
it. I respect him a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alden said he has no short list of candidates in mind to succeed  
Stewart. Possible candidates include Duke assistant Quin Snyder, 
Bob Bender of Washington and longtime Missouri assistant Kim 
Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I would be interested,'' Anderson said. ``As time goes  
on, we'll see what happens.''

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- A tobacco union and growers'  
association will launch a campaign later this month to rid its 
industry of child laborers, a newspaper reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tobacco Industry Union and the Brazilian Association of  
Tobacco Growers will send representatives to identify child 
laborers at some 5,700 tobacco farms in the southern states of 
Parana, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul, the Folha de Sao 
Paulo said. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign is aimed at small farmers, since Brazil's largest  
tobacco growers do not generally employ anyone under 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazilian children work in a wide variety of jobs like  
collecting trash, picking oranges and making charcoal. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1996 U.N. study showed that 9.3 million Brazilian children  
between the ages of 10-17 work to supplement their parents' 
incomes. The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics 
estimates that more than half a million child workers are between 
the ages of 5 and 9.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The Popocatepetl Volcano near Mexico City let  
off steam Friday and showed a slight increase in seismic activity, 
the National Center for Disaster Prevention reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said the ``yellow alert'' signaling caution remained  
in effect and urged people to keep at least 4 1/2 miles away from the 
crater, the Notimex news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The National System for Civil Protection said the volcano had  
emitted several small ``exhalations'' which sent up steam, gas and 
small amounts of ash. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18,000-foot volcano is located just 50 miles southeast of  
Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
	Popocatepetl has been spitting vapor, ash and rock  
intermittently since December 1994, after lying largely dormant 
since 1927. Some 300,000 people live on its slopes and tens of 
millions live within view.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Thousands of landless peasants  
took advantage of the Easter holiday to invade 15 ranches in 
northeastern Brazil, the daily O Estado de Sao Paulo reported 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 2,853 families of the Landless Rural Workers' Movement are  
occupying the properties to pressure the federal government to turn 
the land over in the Zona da Mata region of the state of Alagoas, 
located 3,180 miles north of Rio de Janeiro. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's skewed distribution of land is the major reason for  
chronic rural violence. Nearly 1,000 landless peasants and their 
leaders have been murdered in the past decade, according to the 
Pastoral Land Commission, a human rights group supported by the 
Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
	About 88 percent of the nation's arable land is owned by 20  
percent of the population, while the poorest 40 percent owns just 1 
percent.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A regulatory commission has agreed to annul  
results of the March election for leadership of the Democratic 
Revolution Party, Mexico's main leftist party, due to serious 
irregularities at more than a quarter of voting booths. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Commission on Guarantees and Vigilance voted 10-1  
Thursday night to grant the party's request to annul the results. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission said more than 28 percent of the 5,351 booths set  
up across Mexico recorded irregularities, including illegal changes 
in booth officials and locations, improper documentation, and 
voting totals that exceeded the number of registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
	The March 14 vote was the first national election for top party  
officials ever held in Mexico. More than 600,000 party members cast 
ballots for president, secretary-general and 128 members of the 
national council. 
</P>
<P>
	The party will hold new elections in May.

<HEADLINE>  'Melissa' Virus Suspect Nabbed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- One week after the cunning e-mail virus  
named ``Melissa'' began swamping computers across the country, 
authorities said Friday they had arrested a man who created the bug 
in his apartment and named it for a topless dancer. 
</P>
<P>
	David L. Smith, 30, was arrested Thursday night at his brother's  
house in Eatontown. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges against Smith include interruption of public  
communications, conspiracy and theft of computer service. He faces 
a maximum of 40 years in prison and a $480,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was released on $100,000 bail. State Attorney General  
Peter Verniero said a grand jury would begin hearing the case. 
</P>
<P>
	No one answered the door at Smith's second-floor apartment in  
the central New Jersey town of Aberdeen on Friday. The blinds were 
drawn on his windows and a sliding glass door to a small balcony. 
</P>
<P>
	Melissa appeared on March 26 and spread rapidly around the world  
on Monday like a malicious chain letter. It came disguised as an 
``important message'' from a friend or colleague and caused 
affected computers to fire off 50 infected messages, slowing e-mail 
systems to a crawl. 
</P>
<P>
	Government agencies, companies and thousands of other  
institutions have been affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith has worked as a network programmer for a company that did  
subcontracting for AT&AMP;T Corp., Verniero said. He declined to 
provide any more information about Smith, his employment history or 
a possible motive. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one can get in the mind of the individual,'' Verniero said.  
</P>
<P>
	Smith allegedly created the malicious virus in his apartment and  
spread the bug using a stolen America Online account, said 
Christopher Bubb, head of a state computer analysis unit. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL contacted state authorities after an in-house investigation  
turned up evidence that pointed to New Jersey, Bubb said. Using the 
information provided by AOL, investigators in the state's computer 
unit, with the aid of federal experts, were able to trace the virus 
to Smith's phone number. The investigation took about three days. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus was named for a topless dancer in Florida, where Smith  
once lived, authorities said. Verniero spokeswoman Rita Malley 
would not say how that was known. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators wouldn't explain how they tracked Melissa to  
Smith's phone, saying the investigation is ongoing. But Don 
Willmott, executive editor of PC Magazine Online, said e-mail 
always can be tracked. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter how creative you think you are, you always leave a  
digital trail,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	State authorities searched Smith's home. Verniero wouldn't say  
what authorities found in Smith's apartment, but police hauled out 
several cardboard boxes and briefcases. 
</P>
<P>
	Verniero said Smith cooperated when he was arrested at the home  
of his brother, whose name was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	An executive of a small software company in Cambridge, Mass.,  
told The Associated Press earlier this week that he had found clues 
linking the virus to a writer who uses the computer handle 
``VicodinES.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malley said Smith was ``definitely not'' the person who used  
that handle, but investigators believe he took one virus from 
``VicodinES'' and combined it with another virus to create Melissa. 
</P>
<P>
	The attachment the Melissa virus uses is a Microsoft Word  
document that lists Internet pornography sites. Once the user opens 
the attachment, the virus digs into the user's address book and 
sends infected documents to the first 50 addresses. 
</P>
<P>
	A variation that appeared Tuesday -- carrying the name Melissa.A  
-- leaves the subject line blank, a change that can foil electronic 
filters meant to detect and delete the original virus-bearing 
message, said Dan Schrader, director of product marketing for Trend 
Micro Inc., an antivirus company in Cupertino, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Another variant, ``Papa,'' attaches a Microsoft Excel  
spreadsheet document which, when opened, sends out 60 e-mails. 
However, Papa has bugs that sometimes prevent it from working.

<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The virus spread like lightning, infecting  
scores of computers and overloading e-mail systems of companies and 
governments worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The sleuths who tracked down the alleged culprit, David L.  
Smith, cornered their quarry almost as fast, relying on an age-old 
detective's tool: There are fingerprints in cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter how creative you think you are, you always leave a  
digital trail,'' Don Willmott, executive editor of PC Magazine 
Online, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators say Smith, 30, holed up in his Aberdeen apartment,  
created the virus and named it after a topless dancer from Florida 
called Melissa. 
</P>
<P>
	The bothersome virus first appeared March 26 and spread around  
the world Monday like a malicious chain letter. It came disguised 
as an ``important message'' from a friend or colleague and caused 
affected computers to fire off 50 infected messages, slowing e-mail

faces charges that include interruption of public communications, 
conspiracy and theft of computer service -- charges that carry a 
maximum penalty of 40 years in prison and a $480,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he is tried and successfully convicted, he will do hard  
time,'' said New Jersey Attorney General Peter Verniero.

</P>
<P>
	Investigators wouldn't explain how they tracked Melissa to  
Smith's phone. But Willmott said e-mail ``always leaves a trail,'' 
and that the key was for detectives to untangle the web of computer 
messages. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rest must have been easy,'' he said. ``They did it very  
quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith worked as an on-site consultant for AT&AMP;T Labs in Florham  
Park, employed by Iselin-based CGS Computer Associates. He was 
hired to troubleshoot the facility's personal computers, AT&AMP;T 
spokesman Burke Stinson told The Star-Ledger of Newark. 
</P>
<P>
	After spending the night in jail, Smith, who was released on  
$100,000 bail, called a supervisor at AT&AMP;T Friday morning to say he 
wouldn't make it to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``He phoned his boss today to say he wouldn't be in, but added  
that he'd see him next week,'' Stinson said. ``My reaction is, `Fat 
chance.' My guess is we won't be seeing much of him in the 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently frightened when the FBI posted a warning about  
Melissa last week, investigators said Smith threw his computer 
equipment into one of the trash bins at his central New Jersey 
apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
	``After he put the virus onto the Web, he tried to hide all of  
his computers and manuals,'' said Monmouth County Prosecutor John 
Kaye. ``Everything was thrown into a Dumpster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors of the pale, heavyset Smith said he was neatly groomed  
and ventured outside only to leave for work, dressed simply in 
khakis and a button-down shirt with no tie. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looked like he never went out,'' said Kim Holler, a legal  
secretary who lives in an apartment across a courtyard from Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	A cable installer said he rang Smith's doorbell a month ago  
after receiving a referral that someone new had moved into the 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
	The installer, who identified himself only as John, said the man  
declined his offer for cable service. ``He said, `No, I'm on my 
computer all the time.'''

<HEADLINE> Spring Storm Blankets Prairies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Just when Bill Ellis thought it was safe to stow  
his snow shovel, a storm delivered a few feet of snow Friday to his 
mountain home in southwestern Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	``It caught us unaware,'' Ellis said, just days after he had  
been out bicycling in the sun. A week ago, he said, ``we were using 
the snow shovel to ... clean the yard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy, wet snow on Friday coated budding trees and grass in  
Denver that already had begun turning green. Temperatures hovered 
in the high 20s, a sharp drop from highs in the 70s Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The spring storm blanketed thirsty prairies and mountains with  
the first significant precipitation in weeks, sending residents 
hunting for gloves and parkas that they haven't used much all 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Snowfall amounts ranged from 5 inches in metropolitan Denver to  
2 feet in the Durango area, with more snow expected. 
</P>
<P>
	At lower elevations, commuters crept to work and home on slushy  
streets while mountain travelers contended with wet, ice-spotted 
roads. Some schools canceled classes or delayed start times, and 
skiers and snowboarders flocked to resorts. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with a thick layer of snow across Coors Field, the  
Colorado Rockies canceled their first home appearance of the 
season, an exhibition game against the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	The precipitation came to Colorado after a winter that officials  
said was the driest there in 18 years. A federal survey conducted 
Thursday determined the state's snowpack is 65 percent of normal. 
</P>
<P>
	In Wyoming, snow continued to fall Friday after winter-like  
conditions stymied the state Thursday, canceling flights and 
closing schools. Snowfall amounts ranged up to 31 inches in Sinks 
Canyon in central Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	In North Dakota, several cities had piles of snow from a storm  
that blew through Thursday. About 4,000 residents lost power for a 
time Friday as the state cleaned up from one storm and prepared for 
the next one, expected Saturday night.

spokesman Burke Stinson told The Star-Ledger of Newark. 
</P>
<P>
	After spending the night in jail, Smith, who was released on  
$100,000 bail, called a supervisor at AT&AMP;T Friday morning to say he 
wouldn't make it to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``He phoned his boss today to say he wouldn't be in, but added  
that he'd see him next week,'' Stinson said. ``My reaction is, `Fat 
chance.' My guess is we won't be seeing much of him in the 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently frightened when the FBI posted a warning about  
Melissa last week, investigators said Smith threw his computer 
equipment into one of the trash bins at his central New Jersey 
apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
	``After he put the virus onto the Web, he tried to hide all of  
his computers and manuals,'' said Monmouth County Prosecutor John 
Kaye. ``Everything was thrown into a Dumpster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors of the pale, heavyset Smith said he was neatly groomed  
and ventured outside only to leave for work, dressed simply in 
khakis and a button-down shirt with no tie. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looked like he never went out,'' said Kim Holler, a legal  
secretary who lives in an apartment across a courtyard from Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	A cable installer said he rang Smith's doorbell a month ago  
after receiving a referral that someone new had moved into the 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
	The installer, who identified himself only as John, said the man  
declined his offer for cable service. ``He said, `No, I'm on my 
computer all the time.'''

<HEADLINE> Tradition's Second Round Snowed Out  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- The second round of The Tradition took  
on added importance -- by being snowed out. 
</P>
<P>
	That left competitors in the year's first Senior PGA Tour major  
18 fewer holes to score well and get into position for the $225,000 
first prize in the final round Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament was scheduled for 72 holes, but was scaled back  
to 54 after the cancellation of play Friday, leaving those who 
opened with a bad round little room for error today. 
</P>
<P>
	``It kind of locks everybody in the positions where they  
started,'' said 1993 champion Tom Shaw, who carded an 8-over-par 80 
during a miserable, rainy first round. ``You only have two days to 
change your position if you started with a bad round. If you had a 
good round, it only takes two more to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dale Douglass, who has homes in Colorado and Arizona, began with  
a 71 -- only two shots off the pace set by co-leaders Graham Marsh 
and Howard Twitty -- but was sympathetic to the plight of others who 
had bad scores because of the hypothermia-inducing conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tighter you get, the shorter your swing gets,'' Douglass  
said. ``You can't hit it as far, and you probably can't hit it as 
straight. You just have to stay warm and give yourself a good 
chance of making a swing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marsh and Twitty led Leonard Thompson, Vicente Fernandez and  
Mike McCullough by one stroke and John Morgan, John Bland, Dana 
Quigley, George Archer and Douglass by two when the round began. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 4 inches accumulated during five hours of snow early  
Friday on the scenic Cochise Course at Desert Mountain, where the 
3,200-foot elevation froze the storm's heavy moisture. 
</P>
<P>
	The high temperature in Phoenix 40 miles to the southwest was 59  
degrees, breaking a 77-year-old record for the lowest maximum on 
the date. In nearby Carefree, the high was 53 degrees, but the sun 
broke through and melted the snow, promising better conditions 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaw said outlandish weather is part of the game.  
</P>
<P>
	``The year before I started playing the regular tour (1963), it  
snowed the Crosby out,'' Shaw said. ``Somebody went down to rake 
`Crosby Clambake' in the snow, and it was on the cover of the 
program the next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He recalled snowflakes falling at tournaments in Pensacola,  
Fla., and Las Vegas, where ``my caddie dipped a towel in the water, 
and by the time we got down the fairway, both ends were frozen up 
like the flying nun's headpiece.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cancellation of a round was the second in the tournament's  
11-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jack Nicklaus won the first of his four Tradition titles in  
1990, the first round wasn't played until Friday because of hail 
and rain that forced two suspensions the day before. In better 
weather, Bruce Crampton, Mike Hill, Phil Rodgers and Al Geiberger 
shot 69s to share the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus started with a 71, but had a 67-68 finish to beat Gary  
Player by four strokes.

<HEADLINE> Fabio Rests After Bird Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Fabio was resting at home after  
being smacked in the face by a goose while riding a roller coaster 
at the Busch Gardens theme park. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am grateful for all the cards and well wishes,'' the  
supermodel said in a statement issued Thursday through his manager, 
Eric Ashenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Fabio was at the Virginia theme park Tuesday to help show off  
the Apollo's Chariot roller coaster. The park had promoted the 
event as ``Modern-Day `Adonis' vs. Ancient-Day `Sun God.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Early into the ride, a bird slammed into his face. Fabio was  
treated for a one-inch cut on the bridge of his nose and released 
from a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``I trust they will now install safety measures to make sure  
that this will not happen again,'' Fabio said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Building a roller coaster on a lake inhabited by geese could  
cause more serious accidents or possibly a child's death. I'm glad 
the results were much less significant,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Baghdad Says U.S. Bombs Two Houses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Allied warplanes bombed communications and  
radio facilities in southern Iraq today in the first U.S.-led 
airstrikes in more than two weeks, a U.S. military official said. 
</P>
<P>
	An Iraqi military spokesman earlier claimed that two civilian  
houses had been destroyed by attacks from allied planes flying out 
of bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Cmdr. Ernest Duplessis, spokesman at U.S. Central Command  
headquarters in Tampa, Fla., denied allied strikes destroyed the 
houses. At the time of the Iraqi claim, no attacks had been 
conducted, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hours after the Iraqi claim, Duplessis said, three F-16s  
struck an Iraqi communication facility and a radio relay station, 
following violations of the southern ``no fly'' zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's airstrikes were the first since March 16, when American  
warplanes bombed air defense sites in northern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, U.S. attention has been focused on Yugoslavia, where  
it has been participating in NATO-led airstrikes for the past 10 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, strikes on Iraqi military targets became a  
near-daily occurrence. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and British aircraft patrol the skies over northern and  
southern Iraq, enforcing no-fly zones set up after the 1991 Persian 
Gulf War to protect the Kurdish minority and Shiite rebels. Iraq 
does not recognize the zones and frequently challenges the allied 
planes, provoking retaliatory strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	An unidentified spokesman for Iraq's Air Defenses Command said  
allied F-14s, F-16s and Tornados carried out 18 sorties from Kuwait 
and 33 from Saudi Arabia, the official Iraqi News Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman said allied planes targeted residential areas in  
Afaj, ``causing the destruction of two residential houses and the 
injury of two residents.'' Afaj is in Qadissiya province, 135 miles 
south of Baghdad, the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraqi air defenses ``encountered the enemy formations, forcing  
them to flee to the bases they came from in Kuwait and Saudi 
Arabia,'' INA quoted the spokesman as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not conduct those strikes,'' Duplessis said. He said  
U.S. and allied planes had at that time flown over southern Iraq 
but had not launched any missiles.

<HEADLINE> Fans Pay the Cost of Higher Salaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The cost of those high baseball salaries is  
going straight to the fans. 
</P>
<P>
	The average price of a ticket increased 9.7 percent this year,  
from $13.59 to $14.91, according to the Team Marketing Report, 
which released its annual study Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox, who play in Fenway Park, the smallest stadium in  
the major leagues, remained the most expensive ticket in baseball 
after raising prices 16.6 percent to an average of $24.05 
</P>
<P>
	The World Series champion New York Yankees were once again  
second after a 13.8 percent rise to $23.33. The cost of the best 
box seats at Yankee Stadium has gone up from $25 in 1996 to $50 
this season. In addition, the Yankees last year added 60 
field-level seats that cost $16,000 per season -- $197.53 a game. 
The price of those seats remain unchanged this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle, which moves from the Kingdome to Safeco Field on July  
15, had the highest increase, a 27.2 percent rise to $19.01. The 
New York Mets raised prices 23.5 percent to an average of $19.98, 
Philadelphia 21.2 percent to $13.60, the Chicago Cubs 21.1 percent 
to $17.46 and Texas 20.9 percent to $19.93. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota again has the cheapest average ticket price, even  
after a 2.9 percent increase to $8.46. 
</P>
<P>
	Montreal, which decreased its average price 6 percent to $9.38,  
was 29th and Cincinnati was 28th at $9.71 after a 16 percent 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Expos, two other teams lowered their average  
prices, with Oakland going down 4.5 percent to $10.10 and Tampa Bay 
going down 3.1 percent to $15.08. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's average ticket price has gone up 42.6 percent since  
the 1994 strike, when it was $10.45. The average has increased 72.6 
percent from 1991, when TMR began its annual studies. 
</P>
<P>
	In comparison, the Consumer Price Index has gone up 1.0 percent  
in the last year, 12.1 percent since 1994 and 18.7 percent since 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the increases, baseball tickets remain far cheaper than  
seats for the other major U.S. sports. NFL ticket prices rose 4.7 
percent last season to $42.86, NBA prices went up 3.4 percent this 
season to $42.54 and NHL prices went up 2.5 percent to $42.79. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL tickets have increased 70 percent since 1991 and NBA tickets  
have gone up 83 percent since the 1991-92 season. TMR's NHL studies 
go back only to 1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fan Cost Index, which includes two average-price tickets,  
two average-price child tickets, four small soft drinks, two small 
beers, four hot dogs, parking, two programs and two adult caps, 
increased 6.8 percent to $121.36. The Yankees remained No. 1 in the 
index at $166.84, followed by Boston ($160.21) and the Mets 
($154.58). 
</P>
<P>
	Montreal had the lowest index at $87.87, with Oakland 29th at  
$92.78 and Milwaukee 28th at $95.81. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL's average was $244.98 last season. The NBA is at $240.26  
this season, the NHL at $238.97.

<HEADLINE> Security Grounds Student Satellites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- Doctoral student Michael Swartwout had  
hoped his class project would be orbiting over the Arctic Ocean by 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the 2-foot-wide hexagonal satellite is grounded --  
probably for good -- in a dust-free room at Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
	Like other projects built by engineering students around the  
country, Swartwout's has been kept Earth-bound by a new U.S. policy 
borne of fears over national security. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a wonderfully simple problem,'' said Lewis Franklin, a  
former vice president of TRW Inc., the defense and aerospace 
equipment maker. ``They can't get an affordable launch in the 
United States. They have a free launch offered in another country. 
</P>
<P>
	``But political problems are making it impossible to ship it  
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now a research fellow at Stanford's Center for International  
Security and Cooperation, Franklin has served as a volunteer 
liaison between Stanford's satellite project and potential 
launchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, a private satellite launch in the United States costs  
about $4.5 million. Students usually don't have to foot the bill -- 
they can launch their projects at a big discount or pro bono by 
hitching a ride on larger private or public rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	The 28-year-old Swartwout and his crew, who began their project  
in 1994, had just such a plan, with Moscow Bauman State Technical 
University in Russia offering a free launch for their SAPPHIRE 
(Stanford Audio Phonic Photographic Infra Red Experiment). 
</P>
<P>
	All the students had to do was get their glittering 40-pound  
gadget over there and connect it to the Russian rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	But their plan fell apart last fall when President Clinton  
signed the 1999 defense bill, which reclassified commercial 
satellites as ``munitions'' and turned primary control over 
exporting them from the Commerce Department to the State 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy shift was a response to controversy following the  
1996 crash of a Chinese rocket carrying a satellite built by Loral 
Space &AMP; Communications. After the crash, U.S. officials worried 
that sensitive technology may have been made available to the 
Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole reason the State Department is handling all  
satellite export licenses is to protect the national security of 
the United States,'' an agency spokesman said. ``We're making sure 
we have a tab on who gets what and that sensitive technology is 
safeguarded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SAPPHIRE, however, is an unlikely threat to national  
security. Built in an old basement chemistry lab, it has payload 
that includes a digital camera, a voice synthesizer and a couple of 
telemetry and autonomy experiments -- not the stuff of master spies. 
</P>
<P>
	And certainly there are no trade secrets aboard -- it's made  
mostly from material anyone could buy at a Radio Shack. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just want to put these nifty things in space,'' said Robert  
Twiggs, a visiting professor hired five years ago to jump-start 
Stanford's small satellite development project. ``I'm trying to get 
the students through the life cycle of one of these projects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twiggs said the political wrench thrown in the way may have  
taught the students a good lesson: Make launch arrangements early. 
The program's next satellite, the OPAL, is slated to hitch a ride 
on a U.S. military rocket in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Swartwout isn't going to let the problem hold up his life: ``At  
some point I got kind of resigned to this and realized that I 
better focus on finishing my degree instead of the launch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there are some advantages to working with a satellite  
that never leaves campus. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess in a way it's not bad,'' he said. ``If I have a  
problem I can just walk down and take a look.''

<HEADLINE> US Leads Britian 2-0 in Davis Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) -- Suddenly, the absence of Pete Sampras  
and Andre Agassi doesn't seem all that important. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Courier and Todd Martin took care of that Friday, delivering  
a Davis Cup jolt that could send Britain tumbling out after one 
round. 
</P>
<P>
	Courier outlasted Tim Henman in five pulsating sets, three of  
them going to tiebreakers, and won in 4 hours, 12 minutes. Todd 
Martin then followed his compatriot's lead, sweeping Greg Rusedski 
in less than half the time as the Americans gave their old 
adversary a Davis Cup lesson in the championship's centenary year. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States can clinch the best-of-5 series by winning the  
doubles Saturday when Courier and Alex O'Brien play Henman and 
Rusedski. 
</P>
<P>
	The British pair has won all six times it has played doubles.  
The reverse singles is Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Courier, ranked No. 54 and facing an opponent ranked No. 7, won  
7-6 (7-2), 2-6, 7-6 (7-3), 6-7 (12-10), 7-5 in a match in which 
Henman served 25 aces and 16 double faults. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who after a barren stretch has risen to No. 8,  
surprisingly encountered few problems in his 6-4, 6-4, 6-2 against 
Rusedski. 
</P>
<P>
	The performances by Courier and Martin more than offset the  
decisions by Sampras and Agassi to skip this round of the Davis 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way Todd played today for the first set and a half he  
would have beaten anyone in the world,'' Rusedski said. ``He didn't 
miss a ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Britain is returning to the World Group for the first time since  
1992 and aiming for its first win over the United States since 
1935. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tim and I are extremely disappointed that we couldn't give the  
public just one win,'' Rusedski said. ``They were just too good 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With some 9,000 British fans roaring, Courier survived a running  
battle with three line judges and spectators who twice booed him 
for questioning calls. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's home cooking,'' Courier said.  
</P>
<P>
	His solid service game betrayed him in the second set and Henman  
broke in the fifth and seventh games to take the set. 
</P>
<P>
	Once ranked No. 1, Courier broke in the sixth game of the third  
set to lead 5-2. But Henman broke back and tied it 5-5. During the 
set, Courier glared at three line judges after questioning calls. 
He had words with another after almost crashing into him during a 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
	After Courier served a fault in the tiebreaker, one spectator  
shouted, ``Did you think that was in?'' On the next point, Courier 
powered a forehand winner, turned and pointed toward the fan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was, 'That shot was for you, buddy,''' Courier said  
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Courier again dominated the tiebreaker to regain his lead. When  
he broke to lead 3-1 in the fourth, he looked ready for victory. 
But Henman, urged on by the crowd, broke back for 4-4. After saving 
four match points in the tiebreaker, he took the set 12-10. 
</P>
<P>
	The fifth set went with serve until the 12th game when Henman's  
forehand volley sailed long. Courier, holding three more match 
points, won with a crosscourt service winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin broke Rusedski in the opening set, and the Briton played  
catch-up the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second set, Rusedski squandered a 40-0 lead at 4-4,  
losing the next five points. Martin broke twice for a 5-2 lead in 
the third and clinched it when Rusedski netted a service return. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin's serve has been hampered by a lingering stomach muscle  
injury, but he had enough to prevail Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried hard to make service return winners,'' he said. ``And  
I volleyed pretty well for the most part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In another big upset on the first day of Davis Cup play,  
Slovakia took a 2-0 lead over defending champion Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	Karol Kucera beat Thomas Johansson 6-1, 7-6 (9-7), 2-6, 6-3, and  
Dominik Hrabaty downed Thomas Enqvist 7-5, 4-6, 2-6, 6-2, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very nervous the whole match,'' Kucera said. ``I served  
badly after the first set and had a hard time concentrating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In doubles Saturday, Kucera and Hrabaty face Jonas Bjorkman and  
Nicklas Kulti. 
</P>
<P>
	Other World Group results: Germany 1, Russia 1; Zimbabwe 1,  
Australia 1; Netherlands 1, France 1; Spain 1, Brazil 1; Belgium 1, 
Czech Republic 1; and Switzerland 2, Italy 0.

<HEADLINE> How AP Taxes Poll Was Done </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Associated Press poll on taxes is based on telephone  
interviews with 1,012 randomly selected adults from all states 
except Alaska and Hawaii. The interviewing was conducted March 
26-30 by ICR of Media, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were weighted to represent the population by key  
demographic factors such as age, sex, region and education. 
</P>
<P>
	No more than one time in 20 should chance variations in the  
sample cause the results to vary by more than 3 percentage points 
from the answers that would be obtained if all Americans were 
polled. 
</P>
<P>
	This margin of sampling error is larger for responses of  
subgroups, such as income categories. There are other sources of 
potential error in polls, including the wording and order of 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP poll questions (because of rounding, sums may not total  
100 percent): 
</P>
<P>
	1. Do you think the federal tax system is too complicated, or  
not? 
</P>
<P>
	Too complicated, 66 percent; not too complicated, 28 percent;  
don't know, 6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	2. Would you be willing to give up some deductions to make the  
tax system simpler, or would you not be willing to give up some 
deductions? 
</P>
<P>
	Willing to give up some deductions, 34 percent; Not willing to  
give up some deductions, 56 percent; don't know, 11 percent; 
refused to say, 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	3. Which tax system do you think is fairer, the system we have  
now, with higher tax rates for people with higher incomes, or a 
flat tax with same rates for everyone? 
</P>
<P>
	Present system with higher rates for those with higher incomes,  
39 percent; flat tax with same rate for everyone, 51 percent; don't 
know, 9 percent; refused to say, 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	4. Do you do your own taxes or do you pay to have someone do  
them for you? 
</P>
<P>
	Pay someone to do them, 56 percent; do your taxes yourself, 40  
percent; don't know, 2 percent; refused to say, 1 percent. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Police Seek MSU Riot Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Authorities seeking suspects from a  
weekend riot at Michigan State University have confiscated film 
from a developer and subpoenaed news organizations for photos and 
videotape. 
</P>
<P>
	The seizures by East Lansing police took place Monday and  
Wednesday from a film counter at the Meijer department store. It 
came after employees spotted eight rolls of riot footage and 
notified detectives, who presented a search warrant to obtain the 
film. 
</P>
<P>
	Five of the rolls were taken by a freelance photographer who  
covered the riot for The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	About 5,000 people rioted on the Michigan State campus after the  
school lost its Final Four college basketball game to Duke on 
Saturday. Rioters set cars aflame, broke windows and squared off 
with police. Police have made 27 arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	Meijer spokesman John Zimmerman said store employees acted  
responsibly in alerting police to the riot images. He said it was 
store policy to alert police whenever film processors notice a 
potential crime being committed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a well-publicized act of violence,'' Zimmerman said  
</P>
<P>
	Photo processors in Michigan are not required by law to notify  
police that they have such film, said Robert Ianni, criminal 
division chief in the state attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Probably the theory is once you've given up possession of it,  
you have no expectation of privacy because you've given the film to 
a third party,'' Ianni said. ``If you want privacy, develop it 
yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Stuart Dunnings III said his office also issued  
subpoenas Wednesday to 19 news organizations seeking all their 
videotape and film of the riot. He declined to identify them. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Crosby, executive editor of the Lansing State Journal,  
said the newspaper sent police copies of photos it had published. 
But he said the newspaper is not turning over any other photos 
except one of a man believed to have assaulted a State Journal 
employee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need our independence and integrity to do our job,'' Crosby  
said. ``We don't want to be an arm of the police.'' 
</P>
<P>
	WILX-TV news director Kevin Ragan said he turned over only  
material that his station had broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see the need for our pictures to be part of that  
investigation,'' Ragan said. But he added, ``There are some basic 
First Amendment rights and freedom of the press rights we need to 
protect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police on Thursday also began using a Web site,  
http://www.ci.east-lansing.mi.us, to display pictures of riot suspects. 
Some shots displayed there have been given to detectives 
voluntarily, Lansing Police Lt. Tom Johnstone said.

<HEADLINE> New Baldness Drug Sales Are Slow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- They've finally come up with a pill that  
prevents baldness. So why isn't it flying off the shelves? 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, men are reluctant to take a prescription drug  
when they're healthy. For another, this one carries a slight risk 
of causing impotence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to convince people to try it in the first place,''  
said John Ertel, who uses the hair loss pill Propecia and runs an 
Internet site on hair loss from his Austin, Texas home. 
</P>
<P>
	Pharmaceutical giant Merck &AMP; Co. last year spent a hefty $91  
million promoting Propecia directly to U.S. consumers, according to 
Competitive Media Reporting, a media research firm. 
</P>
<P>
	For the effort, Merck posted just $68 million in U.S. sales last  
year and an additional $15 million overseas. Even though drug 
companies often spend more to promote new drugs than they initially 
receive in sales, Propecia's financial performance is only about 
two-thirds of what Wall Street was expecting. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been an outright disappointment,'' said Neil Sweig, a  
drug analyst with Southeast Research Partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck officials say they are still bullish on Propecia, which  
was first introduced in January 1998 to treat mild to moderate hair 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very pleased with the results,'' said Merck spokeswoman  
Mary Elizabeth Basaman. She said the advertising spending estimates 
were inflated, but refused to disclose how much Merck spent on 
direct-to-consumer Propecia ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Propecia works by suppressing a hormone that shrinks hair  
follicles. It's a lower dosage of Merck's drug Proscar, which 
millions of men have taken to treat enlarged prostates. 
</P>
<P>
	The main side effect seen with Propecia is decreased libido and  
impotence, in just 2 percent of men. The problems disappear when 
men quit taking the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of this helps the product sell to men who are in their  
20s and 30s and are sexual athletes,'' Sweig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Propecia can also cause a certain birth defect in pregnant  
women, and doctors warn women should not even touch the pills. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors say men who take the one a day pill are generally  
satisfied, but the small chance of impotence is a barrier. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only hesitation is there has been a lot of notoriety on  
the side effects associated with the pill,'' said Dr. Ken Washenik, 
a dermatologist at New York University Medical Center who conducts 
research on Propecia. 
</P>
<P>
	Another weakness is that Propecia does little for men with  
receding hairline. It only tends to grow hair on top and back of 
the head, doctors say. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Propecia, the nation's 40 million balding men had only  
one option: slathering nonprescription Rogaine on their scalps 
twice a day. The convenience of Propecia comes at a price. Propecia 
cost $50 a month, twice as much as Rogaine. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of the men who use Propecia grow varying amounts of  
hair, though men often have to use it for six months to a year 
before they see more hair. 
</P>
<P>
	Studies show that after two years of use, 66 percent of Propecia  
patients had regrown hair. 
</P>
<P>
	Propecia is more effective at slowing hair loss. In studies,  
only 17 percent of balding men who took Propecia for two years were 
still losing their hair vs. 72 percent of men who took a placebo. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is definitely the best medical treatment for hair loss,''  
said Dr. Paul McAndrews, a Pasadena, Calif. dermatologist 
specializing in hair loss. He's had just one of 350 Propecia 
patients experienced decreased libido. And that patient stayed on 
the drug because he liked the results. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Propecia was never expected to become a billion-dollar a  
year blockbuster, analysts said Merck saw the pill as a chance to 
sell a drug that millions of men would take for rest of their 
lives-- or as long as they wanted to keep their hair. 
</P>
<P>
	But selling a hair-loss drug has proved a tougher challenge than  
selling a heart drug. 
</P>
<P>
	``Treatment for hair loss requires a lot more groundwork because  
men are just not used to taking drugs for that condition,'' said 
Alex Zisson, analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist. In addition, Propecia 
isn't covered by insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Ertel, 27, who runs Regrowth.com web site has been taking  
Propecia since it first came out. He uses Rogaine as well. So far, 
Ertel likes what he sees when he looks in the mirror: A fuller head 
of hair. ``I look better with hair than without.''

<HEADLINE> Capture of U.S. Soldiers Hits Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Wearing dark sunglasses to shield her tears,  
the mother of a U.S. soldier captured by Serb forces says she has 
faith her son will survive his ordeal in Yugoslavia and return home 
safely. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way I can say how I feel. Everyone knows,'' said  
Vivian Ramirez, whose son, Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez, 24, was 
captured Wednesday near the Yugoslav-Macedonian border. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to thank all the people for their prayers, their  
letters ... the phone calls. I know all of you are praying for my 
son, mi hijo,'' she said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's airstrikes against Yugoslavia are hitting home for many  
Hispanic-American residents of East Los Angeles, which over the 
years has sent thousands of its native sons into uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernie Rios' heart sank when he flipped on his television and  
saw a picture of his boyhood friend, wearing camouflage fatigues 
and looking tired and bruised. 
</P>
<P>
	Rios, 33, grew up two houses down from the Ramirez family in a  
blue-collar East Los Angeles neighborhood, played touch football 
with him on the street and saw him grow from a boy into a clean-cut 
young man. 
</P>
<P>
	And then this image on his TV screen. ``When it's one of your  
own,'' Rios said, ``it really touches you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hispanic-Americans have come into harm's way long before Ramirez  
joined the Army, and they'll do so for years to come, said Daniel 
Ortiz, a Gulf War veteran and commander of the local Veterans of 
Foreign Wars post. 
</P>
<P>
	Ortiz's VFW branch is housed at American Legion Post 804, a navy  
blue building tucked among modest storefronts on Cesar Chavez 
Avenue. Inside, the names of Hispanic-American veterans are etched 
on murals, plaques and pictures covering the walls. 
</P>
<P>
	The veterans' fierce patriotism is obvious. One bumper sticker  
with an American flag reads, ``YOU'LL BURN IT OVER MY DEAD BODY!'' 
A flier tacked on a bulletin board features a sniper's target 
superimposed over a mug shot of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being the hyphenated 'Mexican-American,' a lot of people take  
it for granted that we ARE American, first and foremost,'' Ortiz 
said. ``A lot of people join the military to show we want to be 
counted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, Hispanic-Americans enlisted because they didn't  
have enough money to go to college, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our people needed an alternative, so they joined the military  
and had pride in being an American,'' Ortiz said. ``When our 
country calls, we're proud to step forward and defend our 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They enlist to break free from a landscape of few opportunities  
and low-paying jobs, said Rios, whose father was a Marine corporal 
during the Korean conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good thing,'' Rios said. ``They're over there on the  
other side of the world protecting us. Without people like them, we 
wouldn't be able to have the freedom that we have now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Ramirez said she wrote her son a letter that will be sent  
by the International Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him of how everyone is praying for him and for the  
other two soldiers,'' she said. ``I know how their parents feel, 
how their wives feel. I know we will get them back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rios was among friends, family and supporters participating in a  
candlelight prayer vigil for Ramirez. Similar outpourings of 
support were happening in the hometowns of the two other captured 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Near Capac, Mich., people headed to church to pray for Army  
Staff Sgt. Christopher Stone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Christopher Stone's family is also carrying a cross,'' the  
Rev. Jasper Sirianni said during a Good Friday observance attended 
by Stone's sisters. ``They're carrying a cross today, the cross of 
suffering, the cross of uncertainty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, the parents of Army Spc. Steven Gonzales wrapped a  
yellow ribbon around a pecan tree in the Huntsville town square. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank you to all of the community for the support and prayers  
and the thoughts for our son,'' said Gilbert Gonzalez, whose wife, 
Rosalie, clasped a long stem yellow rose at the ceremony.

<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) -- Right-handed pitcher Mark Leiter was placed  
on the disabled list Friday by the Seattle Mariners, retroactive to 
March 26. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners also outrighted shortstop Giomar Guevara to  
Triple-A Tacoma and claimed infielder Ryan Jackson off waivers and 
optioned him to Tacoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Leiter was placed on the 15-day disabled list with tendinitis in  
his right shoulder. Guevara, who missed most of last season with a 
torn anterior cruciate ligament, hit .241 in 20 spring games. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, 27, played in 111 games with the Florida Marlins last  
season, hitting .250 with 15 doubles, 5 home runs and 31 runs 
batted in.

<HEADLINE> Mexicans Stricken By Baseball Fever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) -- The parking lot of Monterrey's baseball  
park was filled with cars, and a line of several thousand people 
snaked around the stadium, then doubled back again. 
</P>
<P>
	But the game -- the season opener between the San Diego Padres  
against the Colorado Rockies -- was more than three days away. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball fever has struck this northern Mexican city, and word  
that an extra 1,000 tickets would go up for sale for Sunday's game 
sparked a scramble like nothing anyone had ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
	The ticket window opened Thursday morning, but Wednesday night  
the line already stretched more than 100 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	By 2 a.m. there were close to 1,000 people waiting, and by  
Thursday morning the parking lot was jammed with fans in cowboy 
hats and baseball caps alike. 
</P>
<P>
	At the front of the line was Leticia Gonzalez, a 43-year-old  
homemaker who said she had been waiting a full 24 hours to buy 
tickets for herself and her three sons, all of whom play in youth 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't go to Colorado to see Vinny (Castilla),'' she said.  
``This is probably the only chance I'll get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For most of the people in line, the extra tickets meant only  
more frustration. The tickets sold out in less than an hour, 
leaving thousands wanting. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundred people jumped up and down on the car of a man  
accused of being a scalper, demanding that he sell them his tickets 
at cost. A half-dozen terrified policemen finally extricated the 
man safely. 
</P>
<P>
	As is the case across much of northern and coastal Mexico,  
baseball is big in Monterrey, an industrial center just a couple of 
hours south of the Texas border. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball had an indisputable dominance here in the 1940s, when  
the Mexican League was flush with money and brought down players 
from the Major Leagues and the Negro Leagues. Roy Campanella played 
for the local Sultans. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past decades, Mexico's television networks have pitched  
soccer and recently have stopped broadcasting Mexican baseball 
games, but in Monterrey baseball continues to be a major sport. 
</P>
<P>
	That allegiance has paid off before with visits by major league  
teams. In 1991 and 1993 U.S. teams played exhibition games in 
Monterrey, and in 1996 the Padres and the Mets staged a three-game 
series here. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents consider Sunday's opening-day game a confirmation of  
their fanaticism -- and many hope it means someday a big league 
franchise could open here as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a question of time and economic stability,'' said  
Hector Bencomo, a Sultans official and baseball commentator on 
local television and radio. ``The fans are ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, in addition to the Sultans, a professional team with one  
of the best stadiums in Mexico, Monterrey has 53 little leagues in 
which thousands of children hope to follow in Castilla's footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997 Monterrey's Guadalupe Linda Vista team of 12-year-olds  
won the Little League World Series, and in 1998 they were the Latin 
American champs. 
</P>
<P>
	On a recent afternoon, the Linda Vista Marlins -- a team in the  
city's Pacifier League -- was practicing for a big game. 
</P>
<P>
	The players, all under 5 years old, struggled with the weight of  
their miniature bats, but some managed to connect and take off 
scrambling toward first base. 
</P>
<P>
	Otilia Lopez, a 30-year-old homemaker, proudly watched from the  
stands as her 4-year-old son, Naoki, stood for batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We bought him his batting cage. We bought him four gloves and  
a lot of baseballs,'' she said. ``So of course we're going to take 
him to see the game.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Vs. Yen, Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen and the euro  
during lethargic trading Friday, as U.S. foreign exchange trading 
ended early while other major U.S. markets and all European markets 
were closed to observe Good Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0779, down  
from $1.0793 late Thursday. The dollar also was quoted at 120.55 
Japanese yen, up from 120.43 yen on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose against the yen during Asian trading as U.S.  
banks bought dollars when the U.S. currency hit 120.50 yen. The 
dollar also was bolstered by remarks by a senior Japanese Finance 
Ministry official who reiterated the ministry's position that 
excessive yen strength is undesirable. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan expects its exports to help the economy revive from its  
worst recession since World War II and a higher yen makes exports 
more expensive abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	With European markets closed, U.S.-based traders declined to  
move the dollar in either direction because of mixed signals from 
the Labor Department's report Thursday on unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. unemployment rate declined to a 29-year low of 4.2  
percent in March even as job losses mounted in manufacturing 
accompanied by sluggish job growth elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading also was calm because European and some Asia-Pacific  
markets were to remain closed Monday for the remainder of the 
Easter holiday. In addition, the situation in Kosovo continued with 
uncertainty and Japan was to release its quarterly survey on 
business sentiment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are reluctant to hold positions over the weekend''  
given those circumstances, said David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign 
Exchange Analytics in Essex, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4799 Swiss francs, down from  
1.4808, and 1.4960 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4993. The British 
pound fell to $1.6036 from $1.6041. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8146 German 
marks, up from 1.8123; 6.0864 French francs, up from 6.0790; and 
1,795.33 Italian lire, up from 1,792.11.

<HEADLINE> Red Wings 5, Blackhawks 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Goalie Bill Ranford won his first start for  
Detroit and the Red Wings extended their winning streak to five 
games with a 5-3 win over the Chicago Blackhawks on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranford, starting for the first time since Detroit obtained him  
in a trade with Tampa Bay, made 27 saves for his first win since 
Jan. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Wendel Clark, Vyacheslav Kozlov, Larry Murphy, Martin Lapointe  
and Brendan Shanahan scored for Detroit. Sergei Fedorov, Igor 
Larionov and Steve Yzerman each had two assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Daze, Jean-Pierre Dumont and Reid Simpson scored for the  
Blackhawks, who had a four-game unbeaten streak snapped. 
</P>
<P>
	The first-place Red Wings moved nine points ahead of idle St.  
Louis in the Central Division race. Detroit has seven games left 
and the Blues eight. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Blackhawks captain Chris Chelios, who was traded to  
Detroit last month, played his first game against his former 
teammates. The Red Wings are 5-0 with Chelios and Clark, who was 
acquired in a separate deal before the trading deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit went 2-for-5 on its power play and led 3-0 after a rough  
first period in which 46 penalty minutes were called. 
</P>
<P>
	Kozlov converted a return pass from Fedorov for a power-play  
goal at 5:05. The score came with 12 seconds left in a penalty to 
Boris Mironov after the Blackhawks killed off a 5-on-3 advantage 
for Detroit that lasted 1:32. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark redirected Doug Brown's shot into the net at 13:33 for his  
third goal in five games with Detroit. The Red Wings were on 
another power play when Murphy beat Fitzpatrick with a shot from 
between the circles at 16:26. 
</P>
<P>
	Lapointe made it 4-0 just 2:54 into the second period with a  
hard shot from the right circle that beat Fitzpatrick on his stick 
side. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blackhawks scored at 7:22 when Daze's shot from the right  
circle got between Ranford's legs. But Shanahan got that back at 
13:54 when he converted a cross-crease pass from Tomas Holmstrom. 
</P>
<P>
	Dumont beat Ranford stick side from the right circle 7:22 into  
the third and Simpson scored from in front of the crease with 20 
seconds remaining.

<HEADLINE> Pirates' Meares out 5-7 days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKELAND, Fla. (AP) -- Pittsburgh Pirates shortstop Pat Meares  
will be out five to seven days with a sprained left wrist and will 
miss opening day Monday against Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	Meares was injured fouling off a pitch in the fifth inning  
Thursday against the Phillies in Clearwater, Fla. He started to 
take the field in the bottom of the inning, but manager Gene Lamont 
pulled him back and Meares returned to the Pirates' camp in 
Bradenton for X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
	The X-rays showed no break, but Meares will be re-examined by  
team physicians once the team returns to Pittsburgh on Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a little clicking sound in there and they're going to  
check the cartilage, but there doesn't appear to be any ligament 
damage,'' Lamont said. 
</P>
<P>
	If there is cartilage damage, Meares might need arthroscopic  
surgery that could sideline him for 4-6 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	If the cartilage is OK, Meares expects to play again April 9, so  
the Pirates did not put him on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortstop Abraham Nunez was added to the 25-man roster and will  
travel north with the team. The Pirates did not have to clear a 
spot for him because they had not yet added right-hander Kris 
Benson. 
</P>
<P>
	Benson will be activated before making his major league debut  
against the Cubs on Friday, when Nunez is expected to return to 
Triple-A Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	During Meares' absence, rookie Warren Morris will play every day  
at second base and Mike Benjamin will start at short. If Meares' 
injury lingers longer than anticipated, Nunez may make a start or 
two at shortstop against a left-handed starter, with Benjamin 
moving to second. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think a whole lot about injuries, because they're  
going to happen, but four to five days before the season starts you 
like to be injury free,'' Lamont said. ``If somebody gets hurt 10 
days before the season starts, you usually have time to get them 
ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meares' injury came at an inopportune time for the reconstructed  
Pirates, who have rebuilt their lineup with five new starting 
position players since finishing 69-93 last season. 
</P>
<P>
	With Meares contributing four homers and 12 RBIs, the Pirates  
have hit more homers than in any spring since they first began 
compiling detailed statistics in 1986. Not coincidentally, they 
will leave Florida with their first winning spring record since 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates sought to improve their offense after hitting an  
NL-low 107 homers last season -- only 37 fewer than Mark McGwire hit 
by himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The most significant upgrade has been at shortstop, where Meares  
has hit and fielded far better than 1998 starters Kevin Polcovich 
and Lou Collier, who combined for a .223 average, two homers, 48 
RBIs and 38 errors. 
</P>
<P>
	``He makes us a different team,'' Lamont said of Meares.  
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates lucked into landing Meares, one of the majors' most  
productive offensive shortstops with 70 RBIs last season for the 
Twins. He turned down their $10 million offer shortly after the 
season ended, but the Twins later pulled it off the table and 
decided to dramatically cut their payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	Meares suddenly found himself without a team six weeks before  
the start of spring training, and the Pirates were the only team 
that could offer him a chance to start. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is pretty good,'' general manager Cam Bonifay said. ``We're  
going to catch the ball better, our offense is going to be more 
consistent, we're going to score more runs.''

<HEADLINE> N.H.'s Krog Gets Hockey Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Jason Krog had two goals and an assist to  
send New Hampshire to its first NCAA championship game. Some 12 
hours later, the school had another first when Krog won the 1999 
Hobey Baker Award, given to college hockey's best player. 
</P>
<P>
	Krog, the nation's scoring leader this year, was presented with  
the award Friday at a ceremony that seemed like a New Hampshire pep 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony was held at the team hotel for the NCAA Frozen  
Four, and the crowd packing the ballroom included Krog's teammates 
and coaches, many of his relatives and a group of cheering Wildcats 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thank my teammates for making the year so successful and  
enjoyable,'' said Krog, a senior center. ``I feel this award is 
just as much theirs as mine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He invited his teammates onto the podium, and some helped him  
hold the trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he's accomplished is not by accident,'' coach Richard  
Umile said. ``He has led our team by example. He doesn't talk a 
lot, he just does it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krog was a unanimous selection for the Hockey East Player of the  
Year, leading the Wildcats to the conference title. He ranked in 
the top 10 percent of his academic class with a 3.67 grade-point 
average last semester. He was a finalist for college hockey's 
Humanitarian Award. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the ice or in the classroom, everybody looks up to Jason.  
He's respected as a hard worker in everything he does,'' Umile 
said. ``For me, it's been a special honor to coach Jason Krog and 
spend four years with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krog has 84 points on 34 goals and 50 assists, with one more  
game to go -- New Hampshire faces Hockey East rival Maine on 
Saturday for the 1999 NCAA title. 
</P>
<P>
	Krog had a pair of goals and an assist in Thursday night's 5-3  
semifinal victory over Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats made it to the semis last year, but were eliminated  
4-0 by eventual champion Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 10 finalists for this year's Hobey Baker Award.  
Michigan State center Mike York was the runner-up, but no other 
spots were announced. 
</P>
<P>
	The finalists are picked by a vote of the NCAA's Division I  
coaches, then a committee consisting of coaches, print and 
electronic media representatives, NHL scouts and one USA Hockey 
representative choose the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	The other finalists were Jason Blake of North Dakota, Hugo  
Boisvert of Ohio State, Brian Gionta of Boston College, Jeff 
Hamilton of Yale, Eric Heffler of St. Lawrence, Steve Kariya of 
Maine, Michel Larocque of Boston University and Brian Swanson of 
Colorado College. 
</P>
<P>
	Kristine Pierce, a star for the Rochester Institute of  
Technology, received the 1999 Humanitarian Award for her volunteer 
work. She helped at a soup kitchen and worked with children.

<HEADLINE> Military Jury Dismisses Marine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A military jury issued the first  
punishment against an aviator involved in the Italian ski gondola 
accident today, kicking the jet's navigator out of the Marines for 
destroying a videotape shot during the fatal flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Joseph Schweitzer had pleaded guilty to obstruction of  
justice and conspiracy -- charges that carried up to 10 years in 
prison. He admitted throwing the tape into a fire two days after 
his jet clipped an Alpine gondola cable, killing 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
	After deliberating for more than three hours, a jury of nine  
Marine officers recommended that Schweitzer be dismissed from the 
military -- the equivalent of a dishonorable discharge for an 
enlisted person. 
</P>
<P>
	He smiled at his lawyers after court adjourned.  
</P>
<P>
	``I respect the decision that was made by my peers,'' said  
Schweitzer, 31, who has been an officer for 10 years. ``A long, 
painful chapter of my life was finally concluded, and I was happy 
to start a new one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Col. Alvin Keller, the judge, accepted the jury's  
recommendation, which was virtually identical to the punishment 
proposed in his plea agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentence still must be approved by Lt. Gen. Peter Pace, who  
convened the court-martial. Pace, commander of Marine Forces 
Atlantic in Norfolk, Va., may approve the sentence or recommend a 
lighter one, and Schweitzer has the right to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Dave Beck said he would urge Pace to reduce the  
sentence to a reprimand or no punishment at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer and Capt. Richard Ashby, the pilot of the EA-6B  
Prowler jet, originally faced manslaughter charges that could have 
sent them to prison for more than 200 years. 
</P>
<P>
	A military jury acquitted Ashby in February, and similar charges  
against Schweitzer were then dropped by the government. Ashby still 
faces an obstruction court-martial for the destruction of the 
videotape. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ashby verdict enraged and embittered relatives of the  
victims, as well as Italian leaders, who said they would explore 
options in pursuing their own case against the crew. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the victims' relatives was present when Schweitzer was  
sentenced. Schweitzer, of Westbury, N.Y., sat stoically as the 
verdict was read. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, families of the Belgian victims issued a statement  
criticizing the U.S. government for not agreeing to settle with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why will the U.S. government not accept responsibility and  
exercise its authority to close this case as soon as possible in a 
humane and amicable manner?'' asked Yves Eyskens, whose sister, 
Rose-Marie was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Margo Anthonissen, who lost her daughter, Hadewich, complained  
that the victims' relatives weren't permitted to fully describe 
their loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are unhappy we twice flew all the way from Belgium to tell  
our story, only to be restricted from discussing the essence of 
this whole case,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maj. Stu Couch, a government prosecutor, had argued that  
Schweitzer should not only be kicked out of the Marines, but should 
also be sent to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is this a character flaw or just a crime?'' Couch asked in his  
closing statement Friday. ``Everybody trusted him. ... That makes 
the perfect conspirator, somebody who has that amount of trust 
built up over a period of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couch said the tape so worried Schweitzer and Ashby that they  
stayed in the cockpit after making an emergency landing at the 
Aviano, Italy, air base to swap the tape for a blank one. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer testified Thursday that he stopped taping 10 minutes  
before the jet severed the cable, but had smiled once into the 
camera and feared the image would be used in media reports of the 
tragedy. Destroying the tape was the biggest mistake of his life, 
he said.

<HEADLINE>  Collapsed Lung Sidelines Lindros </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Eric Lindros will miss the rest of the  
regular season because of a collapsed lung, an injury that 
apparently happened when he was checked during a game against 
Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers said Friday their star center will stay at the  
hospital in Nashville at least another two or three days. His 
status for the playoffs, if the Flyers qualify, will be determined 
when he returns to Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a serious injury,'' team president and general manager  
Bobby Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
	The team is unsure precisely when Lindros was hurt Thursday  
night. The injury seemed to happen when he was crosschecked, but 
television replays also showed the 6-foot-4 center falling on his 
stick in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers said nearly three quarts of blood filled the space  
where the right lung collapsed, and doctors at Baptist Hospital in 
Nashville are draining blood with a chest tube. 
</P>
<P>
	Flyers team physician Dr. Gary Dorshimer said doctors in  
Nashville inserted a vacuum pump in the lung to help re-expand it. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros spoke with reporters in the locker room for several  
minutes following the Flyers' 2-1 victory over the Predators and 
did not appear in pain. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he awakened Friday with chest pains and went to the  
hospital. The hospital referred all questions to the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Lindros, Eric's father and agent, did not immediately  
return a call. 
</P>
<P>
	The 26-year-old star remained in Nashville while the rest of the  
team flew to Boston, where the Flyers play the Bruins on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was checked in the ribs on the right side,'' Dorshimer  
said. ``He either suffered a rib fracture, or there was enough 
force with the sudden impact trauma that it caused a small 
micro-tear in the lung. That cause the lung to collapse and blood 
to fill in the space.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This was Lindros' first game following a two-game suspension for  
high-sticking and cutting Petr Nedved of the New York Rangers 
during Philadelphia's 3-1 victory Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros leads the Flyers with 40 goals and 93 points in 71  
games. The Flyers, who have seven games left in the regular season, 
already are without top defenseman Eric Desjardins. Philadelphia is 
tied with Pittsburgh for second place in the Atlantic Division. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros whiffed his one shot on goal Thursday night. Winger  
Mikael Renberg said the Flyers appreciated having their captain 
back following the two-game suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need him bad out there,'' Renberg said. ``I mean that's not  
easy for him not to play two games.''

<HEADLINE> Military Jury Says To Dismiss Marine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A military jury on Friday recommended  
dismissal from the Marine Corps for a navigator who admitted 
destroying a personal videotape he made before his jet cut an 
Italian ski gondola cable, killing 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine-man panel of Marine officers deliberated 3 1/2 hours  
Friday before recommending the punishment for Capt. Joseph 
Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer sat stoically and the courtroom was silent as the  
judge, Col. Alvin Keller, imposed the recommended sentence. But 
after court adjourned, Schweitzer smiled at his lawyers and nodded 
his head. 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer pleaded guilty Monday to obstruction of justice and  
conspiracy for destroying the tape after his EA-6B Prowler hit the 
cable over Cavalese, Italy, on Feb. 3, 1998. The ski gondola 
plunged 370 feet into a valley. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge had the option of sentencing Schweitzer to a  
previously undisclosed punishment recommended as part of 
Schweitzer's guilty plea, or to accept the jury's recommendation -- 
whichever is more lenient. 
</P>
<P>
	He chose the jury's recommendation. The sentence proposed in the  
plea agreement, divulged after the jury made its recommendation, 
called for forfeiture of pay and allowance and dismissal from the 
Marine Corps. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentence doesn't take effect until it is approved by Lt.  
Gen. Peter Pace, who convened the court-martial. Pace, commander of 
Marine Forces Atlantic in Norfolk, Va., may approve the sentence or 
recommend a lighter one. Schweitzer then could choose to pursue his 
decision through the military appeals process. 
</P>
<P>
	A prosecutor, Maj. Stu Couch, urged the jury earlier Friday to  
recommend Schweitzer's dismissal from the service and prison, but 
said the government didn't wish to see him sentenced to the maximum 
10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is this a character flaw or just a crime?'' Couch asked.  
``Everybody trusted him. ... That makes the perfect conspirator, 
somebody who has that amount of trust built up over a period of 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Dave Beck said the harshest punishment should  
be a letter of reprimand. 
</P>
<P>
	``Capt. Schweitzer has got to get up every day and know his  
career in the Marine Corps is over,'' Beck said. ``This good and 
faithful Marine, this outstanding Marine officer made some bad 
decisions over a three- to five-day period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beck reminded the jurors that Schweitzer ``looked you in the  
eye. ... He told you things that nobody had any way of knowing 
until he came forward to tell the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couch said the tape so worried Schweitzer and the pilot, Capt.  
Richard Ashby, that they stayed in the cockpit after making an 
emergency landing at the Aviano, Italy, air base to swap the tape 
for a blank one. Schweitzer said he later tossed the cassette into 
a bonfire. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's the one thing on his mind?'' Couch asked. ``That tape.  
That tape was stressing him out ... driving him nuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schweitzer testified Thursday that he stopped taping 10 minutes  
before the jet severed the cable, but said he smiled once into the 
camera and feared the image would be used in media reports of the 
tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	He described his destruction of the tape as the biggest mistake  
of his life and said he wanted to die after learning people in the 
gondola had been killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Involuntary manslaughter charges against Schweitzer were dropped  
after Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., was acquitted last month 
of the same charges. Ashby still faces the two obstruction charges 
and his trial is scheduled April 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Two back seat crewmen in the radar-jamming aircraft were charged  
after the accident, but the charges were dismissed last year.

<HEADLINE> Mixup Costs Record at Swim Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Matthew Dunn should have swum third and Ray  
Hass fourth in Australia's 800-meter freestyle relay at the world 
short-course swimming championships. 
</P>
<P>
	But the order was reversed, and the difference was a lost chance  
at $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	For not following the order listed on the entry card,  
Australia's relay quartet was disqualified today in the 
preliminaries for the event. 
</P>
<P>
	The team in the heats came within two seconds of breaking its  
own world record, and for the final, the team planned to substitute 
-- legally -- three world champions, giving them a strong chance at a 
short-course world record. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'd have broken the record by a considerable amount,''  
Australian coach Don Talbot said. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury dismissed an appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	For the first time at these championships, FINA, swimming's  
world governing body, is offering $15,000 for each world record 
broken. 
</P>
<P>
	Record breakers so far include Australian Ian Thorpe in the  
200-meter freestyle; the Swedish women's 800-meter freestyle relay 
team; Slovakia's Martina Moravcova, who beat American Jenny 
Thompson's world mark in the 100-meter individual medley; and 
Thompson, who promptly broke it again. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbot said he had submitted the entry card with Dunn third and  
Hass fourth, behind Todd Pearson and Daniel Kowalski. Preparing to 
send the swimmers into action, an Australian staffer sought to 
reach an officials' table to check the card and make sure they were 
following the correct order, Talbot said. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said, officials ``don't let people move around freely''  
in the Hong Kong Coliseum, and the staffer wasn't allowed access to 
the table. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, Talbot said, a meet official who should have ensured in  
advance that swimmers were in the correct order did not do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly there was fault with us,'' Talbot said, ``but I  
think everybody has a right to argue their case. They didn't want 
to hear that there was error on their side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was prepared to point out to the appeals jury that a Canadian  
women's relay quartet swam out of order Thursday without penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury refused to hear explanations, he added.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to rebound from the disappointment. They were set on  
getting a world record, and there's bonus money for that,'' Talbot 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The team that swam in the heats finished in 7 minutes, 4.73  
seconds, close to the world mark of 7:02.74 set by Australia at the 
last short-course championships in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	For the final, the Australians had planned to have Thorpe, Grant  
Hackett and Michael Klim join Dunn for a run at the record. 
</P>
<P>
	Thorpe is the world long-course champion at 400 meters, and  
holds the short-course world records at 200 and 400. Last week, 
Hackett broke the world 200-meter long-course record. He also is 
the world long-course champion at 1,500 meters and the short-course 
world record holder in that event. Klim is the long-course world 
champion in the 200 freestyle and 100 butterfly.

<HEADLINE> Arco Finds Put Alaska on Oil Map </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- When Richfield Oil Corp. arrived in  
Alaska, the only locally produced oil came from fish. 
</P>
<P>
	The year was 1955, and Alaska was still a federal territory  
fighting to become a state. Opposition to statehood was strong in 
Washington, D.C., largely because it wasn't clear that sprawling, 
thinly populated Alaska could support itself. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1957, Richfield's first Alaska well was in the Cook Inlet  
area, and it came in as a gusher. The worry about self-sufficiency 
ebbed, and the following year Congress voted overwhelmingly to make 
Alaska the 49th state. 
</P>
<P>
	The success at Swanson River marked the beginning of a  
four-decade relationship that produced huge riches for both the 
state and the company, whose name had been changed to Atlantic 
Richfield Co. when it discovered the real bonanza -- Prudhoe Bay, 
the largest oil field ever found in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could say Alaska made Arco, and Arco certainly had a  
pervasive impact on the state,'' said Gil Mull, a former Richfield 
geologist. 
</P>
<P>
	Those heady days are long gone for Arco, and soon its name will  
be, too. The company, pounded hard by prolonged low prices, was 
swallowed by BP Amoco PLC this week for $25.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which still must be approved by regulators, won't be  
final until the end of the year. In the meantime, Arco will 
continue as its own company, but in the minds of former workers and 
others in Alaska, the obituary has already been printed. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us feel some loss,'' said Harold Heinze, a former Arco  
president in Alaska. ``Though I probably feel a little more for the 
current employees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're losing a hell of a friend,'' said former Gov. Walter  
Hickel. 
</P>
<P>
	Losing Arco would leave BP Amoco as the only company operating  
on the North Slope, which accounts for more than one-sixth of the 
nation's oil production. BP Amoco would control more than 70 
percent of Alaska's crude output, and have a similar stake in the 
800-mile trans-Alaska oil pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco now pumps far more oil off the North Slope, but Arco  
was seen as having the better prospects by virtue of being a more 
vigorous explorer. 
</P>
<P>
	What worries some in oil-dependent Alaska is that the loss of  
Arco as a North Slope competitor could mean less hunting for new 
fields there. 
</P>
<P>
	``BP has always gone for the elephants,'' said Jack Roderick,  
whose book ``Crude Dreams'' chronicled Alaska's oil history. ``Do 
they have the incentive to move out from what they know? They 
haven't done it yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``BP has not been the real aggressive organization in frontier  
exploration,'' said Mull, who now works for the state. ``Most of 
the major discoveries, I think, are made by smaller companies 
willing to step out and do outrageous things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outrageous would describe Arco's devotion to the North Slope in  
the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	The region's geology had attracted a lot of interest, but no one  
could find any oil -- more than a dozen expensive holes were 
drilled, and every one of them dry. 
</P>
<P>
	Cash-strapped Richfield was getting ready to join the corporate  
exodus in the spring of 1967. But the company decided to drill one 
more well at an obscure place called Prudhoe Bay, and ended up 
driving the bit down into an oil reservoir that has so far yielded 
more than 10 billion barrels of crude. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this had been a dry hole, the North Slope would have been  
dead for a few years,'' said retired Arco geologist Marvin Mangus, 
who helped choose the Prudhoe Bay drill site. ``Maybe it would 
still be dead.'' BP was among those ready to pack it in when Arco 
drilled the Prudhoe Bay discovery well. Arco had offered to buy its 
Prudhoe acreage for a good price, but apparently pushed a little 
too hard to close the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	A suspicious BP held out and soon came news of the discovery. It  
started drilling wells and, as luck would have it, the largest 
share of the oil lay under its land.

<HEADLINE> Jr. Gotti Wants To Return to Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Just five days before his federal racketeering  
trial was to begin, John A. ``Junior'' Gotti, who fought to obtain 
release on bail, asked a judge to put him back in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Gotti, indicted in January 1998, was released on $10 million  
bail in October under strict conditions. Two dozen friends and 
relatives put up their homes and businesses to help him make bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors allege Gotti, 35, acted as head of the Gambino crime  
family after his father, John J. Gotti, was convicted of murder in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors did not object to Thursday's unusual request, and  
Gotti is to surrender to marshals on Tuesday, the day his trial is 
scheduled to start. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of Gotti's release, he must wear an electronic  
ankle bracelet to track his movements, his phone calls are 
monitored, and he has to pay about $24,000 a month for security 
guards posted outside his house. 
</P>
<P>
	In U.S. District Court, defense lawyer Gerald Shargel began to  
explain his client's request before Gotti stopped him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can no longer afford,'' Shargel said when Gotti cut him  
off, saying, ``Never mind, never mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Gotti's lawyers sought to lower his bail conditions in  
December, defense attorney Sarita Kedia said her client was broke.

<HEADLINE> Bomber May Have Targeted Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal investigators examined charred remains  
of a mail bomb here for evidence it may have been sent by a man who 
tried Friday to plead guilty in a bomb incident in Las Vegas, 
government officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also looked for evidence the device found at a  
Washington post office was intended for President Clinton, said law 
enforcement sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. A law 
enforcement source would not say why authorities think Clinton may 
have been targeted. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources said initial examination of the device showed  
similarities to a bomb that exploded at a Dallas post office and to 
explosive devices found in Las Vegas, where Frank Darwin Alexander 
was arrested Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, 53, appeared Friday before a federal magistrate in  
Las Vegas, where he attempted to plead guilty to charges related to 
a bomb allegedly addressed to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms office in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I plead no contest, ... guilty,'' Alexander told Magistrate  
Robert Johnston. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston, however, refused to accept the plea and appointed a  
public defender for Alexander. An April 9 arraignment was scheduled 
and Alexander was ordered held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
	During the hearing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas O'Connell  
said Alexander told Las Vegas police he had mailed two devices and 
attempted to mail a third. O'Connell said one detonated in a Dallas 
postal facility and another likely detonated in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	No injuries were reported in connection with any of the devices.  
</P>
<P>
	O'Connell said Alexander also told police he had ``an admiration  
for Theodore Kaczynski and Timothy McVeigh'' and would do the same 
thing again if released. The prosecutor said police found canisters 
of gunpowder and pipe, ``enough to construct eight or so devices,'' 
in Alexander's room. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander also faces state charges in connection with explosive  
devices found in his Las Vegas motel room. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said federal investigators are comparing remnants of  
the Washington device with unexploded bombs found in Las Vegas and 
components of the pipe bomb that exploded and ignited a small fire 
Sunday inside the Dallas Bulk Mail Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're ... looking at components that have been taken to the  
ATF lab, and getting together with the postal lab,'' ATF special 
agent Brad Earman said in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The Secret Service, which investigates threats against the  
president, is involved because of the possibility the Washington 
bomb was addressed to the White House, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Secret Service referred questions about Alexander to the  
U.S. attorney's office in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still investigating his days prior to Sunday. We  
continue to try to understand everything that was going on,'' said 
Tracy Hite, an ATF agent in Las Vegas. ``We're not going to talk 
about motive,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	ATF agents helped collect the debris from the Washington bomb  
Thursday night -- nearly a week after the device apparently started 
a smoky fire inside a truck trailer at the post office loading 
dock. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, post office employees and local Washington  
firefighters thought ``something combustible, or careless smoking, 
or something else innocuous'' ignited the March 26 fire, said 
postal inspector Douglas Bem. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three containers of mail were charred severely,'' and left  
behind at the loading dock when firefighters left, Bem said. The 
containers sat undisturbed until Thursday, when investigators in 
the Alexander case asked about the possibility ``of another device 
that might be headed this way,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Local postal officials then noticed the routine internal report  
of the loading dock fire, Bem said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bomb investigators who then headed to the loading dock  
determined almost immediately that the damage was not from an 
ordinary fire, one source said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Remains of the device arrived at the Postal Inspection Service  
laboratory near Washington, where analysts were already examining 
remains of the Dallas bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander told authorities the Dallas mail bomb was addressed to  
San Antonio television evangelist John Hagee, pastor of the 
17,000-member Cornerstone Ministries, said Linda Kirksey, a postal 
inspector in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief statement, Hagee said he was cooperating with the  
investigation.

<HEADLINE> Body-Part Replacement Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In what may be a major step toward learning  
how to grow replacement body parts, researchers in Baltimore have 
isolated from adult bone marrow a master cell that can be induced 
to grow bone or cartilage. 
</P>
<P>
	A study published today in the journal Science reports that  
researchers at Osiris Therapeutics extracted a single mesenchymal 
stem cell from bone marrow and then grew it into a colony of more 
than a million cells that could be directed to produce either bone, 
cartilage or fat. 
</P>
<P>
	If the technique proves successful, researchers predict that  
precursor cells for bone could be used to replace tissue lost to 
cancer, osteoporosis, injury or dental disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts said the study is an important achievement for the new  
and rapidly expanding field of stem cell research. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that they can (isolate) a precursor cell like that,  
and direct it to produce specific cell types, is quite an 
advance,'' said Dr. James A. Thomson of the University of 
Wisconsin, a noted pioneer in stem cell research. ``It may be that 
such cells can eventually be used for therapy and that would be 
quite exciting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study using adult stem cells is important also because it  
avoids the controversy of using stem cells from embryos, said Dr. 
Mark F. Pittenger, who led the team of Osiris researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Stem cells are the body's building blocks. Some, such as  
pluripotent stem cells, come only from embryos and their use in 
research is opposed by many people. 
</P>
<P>
	Other stem cells, such as the mesenchymal cells used by Osiris,  
are produced in adults. 
</P>
<P>
	But only the pluripotent stem cells from embryos are thought to  
be capable of growing into any tissue in the body. The mesenchymal 
stem cells are the parent lines for bone, cartilage, fat, tendon 
and muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Osiris work helps move stem cell research from the  
laboratory toward the clinic, said Dr. David J. Anderson, a Howard 
Hughes Medical Institute stem cell researcher at the California 
Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to use stem cells to replace damaged tissue, you  
have to first know how to differentiate those cells in the lab dish 
before you put them into a patient,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In their work, Osiris researchers led by Pittenger grew a single  
mesenchymal stem cell through more than 20 generations to create 
about a million cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers then altered the culture medium and added  
proteins that caused the specimens to grow into cell families, or 
lineages, that would produce bone, tendon or fat, Pittenger said. 
Other work under way may lead to producing muscle cell lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've arrived at conditions that allow us a very strong degree  
of control,'' said Pittenger. ``When we direct these cells to the 
(cartilage) lineage, almost all of the cells grow to that 
lineage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That means it's very likely that researchers will eventually be  
able to inject specific types of cells into patients, which then 
would grow into replacement bone, tendon or muscle, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Laboratory research on animals is already underway and human  
studies may be possible in three years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Research in rabbits and dogs already has shown that gaps in leg  
bone caused by surgery, such as for cancer, can be filled in with 
tissue grown in the body from stem cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Animal studies also are underway to determine if stem cells  
injected into the heart can replace scar tissue caused by heart 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has banned federal financing of research using human  
embryos, and some lawmakers oppose a National Institutes of Health 
plan to possibly pay for embryonic stem cell research. 
</P>
<P>
	But Thomson, one of the first to isolate stem cells from human  
embryos, said that although researchers have proven that some types 
of stem cells can be obtained from adults, there is still a 
scientific need for embryonic stem cell research. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no known adult stem cells for some critical organs,  
such as kidney, heart and lung, he noted. If replacements are to be 
grown for these parts, Thomson said, it would require embryonic 
stem cell research.

<HEADLINE> Mexicans Stricken By Baseball Fever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) -- The parking lot of Monterrey's baseball  
park was filled with cars, and a line of several thousand people 
snaked around the stadium, then doubled back again. 
</P>
<P>
	But the game -- the season opener between the San Diego Padres  
against the Colorado Rockies -- was more than three days away. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball fever has struck this northern Mexican city, and word  
that an extra 1,000 tickets would go up for sale for Sunday's game 
sparked a scramble like nothing anyone had ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
	The ticket window opened Thursday morning, but Wednesday night  
the line already stretched more than 100 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	By 2 a.m. there were close to 1,000 people waiting, and by  
Thursday morning the parking lot was jammed with fans in cowboy 
hats and baseball caps alike. 
</P>
<P>
	At the front of the line was Leticia Gonzalez, a 43-year-old  
homemaker who said she had been waiting a full 24 hours to buy 
tickets for herself and her three sons, all of whom play in youth 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't go to Colorado to see Vinny (Castilla),'' she said.  
``This is probably the only chance I'll get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For most of the people in line, the extra tickets meant only  
more frustration. The tickets sold out in less than an hour, 
leaving thousands wanting. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundred people jumped up and down on the car of a man  
accused of being a scalper, demanding that he sell them his tickets 
at cost. A half-dozen terrified policemen finally extricated the 
man safely. 
</P>
<P>
	As is the case across much of northern and coastal Mexico,  
baseball is big in Monterrey, an industrial center just a couple of 
hours south of the Texas border. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball had an indisputable dominance here in the 1940s, when  
the Mexican League was flush with money and brought down players 
from the Major Leagues and the Negro Leagues. Roy Campanella played 
for the local Sultans. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past decades, Mexico's television networks have pitched  
soccer and recently have stopped broadcasting Mexican baseball 
games, but in Monterrey baseball continues to be a major sport. 
</P>
<P>
	That allegiance has paid off before with visits by major league  
teams. In 1991 and 1993 U.S. teams played exhibition games in 
Monterrey, and in 1996 the Padres and the Mets staged a three-game 
series here. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents consider Sunday's opening-day game a confirmation of  
their fanaticism -- and many hope it means someday a big league 
franchise could open here as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a question of time and economic stability,'' said  
Hector Bencomo, a Sultans official and baseball commentator on 
local television and radio. ``The fans are ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, in addition to the Sultans, a professional team with one  
of the best stadiums in Mexico, Monterrey has 53 little leagues in 
which thousands of children hope to follow in Castilla's footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997 Monterrey's Guadalupe Linda Vista team of 12-year-olds  
won the Little League World Series, and in 1998 they were the Latin 
American champs. 
</P>
<P>
	On a recent afternoon, the Linda Vista Marlins -- a team in the  
city's Pacifier League -- was practicing for a big game. 
</P>
<P>
	The players, all under 5 years old, struggled with the weight of  
their miniature bats, but some managed to connect and take off 
scrambling toward first base. 
</P>
<P>
	Otilia Lopez, a 30-year-old homemaker, proudly watched from the  
stands as her 4-year-old son, Naoki, stood for batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We bought him his batting cage. We bought him four gloves and  
a lot of baseballs,'' she said. ``So of course we're going to take 
him to see the game.''

<HEADLINE> Collapsed Lung Sidelines Lindros </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The regular season came to an abrupt end for  
Philadelphia Flyers center Eric Lindros after he suffered a 
collapsed right lung. His status for the playoffs remains unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros, the Flyers' on-ice and emotional leader, apparently  
suffered the injury after being cross-checked during the Flyers' 
2-1 win at Nashville on Thursday. Television replays also showed 
Lindros falling on his stick in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury was never considered career-threatening, team  
officials stressed. Lindros will remain at Baptist Hospital in 
Nashville for at least another day to stabilize his lung, and his 
status for the playoffs will be re-evaluated when he returns to 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Listening to Dr. (Gary) Dorshimer and after talking to the  
doctors in Nashville, this is a serious injury,'' team president 
and general manager Bob Clarke said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	A Flyers spokesman said the rest of the team, which played the  
Bruins in Boston today, was caught off-guard, because Lindros did 
not complain of chest pains after the Predators game. 
</P>
<P>
	``The players' health is of major concern to us. We won't be  
playing him until all doctors are very confident that his health is 
fine,'' Clarke added. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros spoke with reporters in the dressing room for several  
minutes following the victory and did not appear to be in pain. He 
awoke Friday morning with chest pain and went to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly three quarts of blood filled into the space where the  
lung collapsed, and doctors at the hospital drained out the blood 
with a chest tube. Droshimer, the Flyers' team physician, said 
doctors in Nashville inserted a vacuum pump in the lung to help 
re-expand it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was checked in the ribs on the right side. He either  
suffered a rib fracture, or there was enough force with the sudden 
impact trauma that it caused a small microtear in the lung,'' said 
Dorshimer, who added that Lindros was in stable condition and 
resting comfortably at Baptist Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that he is in excellent physical shape and a strong  
person to begin with will help in his recovery,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He estimated it would be at least seven days before doctors  
could determine the length of Lindros' recovery period and whether 
he would be healthy enough to play in the playoffs. Philadelphia is 
tied with Pittsburgh for fifth place in the Eastern Conference; 
eight teams make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Lindros, Eric's father and agent, did not immediately  
return a telephone message seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Lindros' first game following a two-game suspension for  
high-sticking and cutting Petr Nedved of the New York Rangers 
during Philadelphia's 3-1 victory last Saturday. He missed two 
other games this season because of a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss was a major blow to the Flyers, who already are without  
top defenseman Eric Desjardins. Lindros leads the Flyers with 40 
goals and 93 points in 71 games. They are 1-1-2 without him this 
season and 44-47-11 during his career with the Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The team also announced that Lindros' regular left wing, John  
LeClair, would miss at least the next two games because of a sore 
back. The Flyers have seven games left. 
</P>
<P>
	Right wing Mark Recchi's status was to be evaluated before the  
Boston game after he complained of headaches and nausea. Dorshimer 
said Recchi's condition might be partly related to the March 22 
concussion that kept him out of the lineup for three games.

<HEADLINE> Nets' Williams Goes on Injured List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- New Jersey Nets interim coach Don  
Casey calls it ``center by committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's what it's come down to for the Nets, now that All-Star  
center Jayson Williams has joined the team's big men on the injured 
list. 
</P>
<P>
	But after practice Friday, Casey was confident of his team's  
ability to cope with the latest in a series of troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a resilient bunch of players, and this is another  
challenge,'' Casey said. ``I don't know of any team that's had 
their whole center corps wiped out, but this team will work hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams broke his right leg in a season-ending collision with  
teammate Stephon Marbury late in the fourth quarter of the Nets' 
90-85 win over the Atlanta Hawks Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Russell Warren inserted a plate and five screws into  
Williams' leg Friday at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New 
York City. Williams will be hospitalized until Monday and will 
start motion therapy over the next two days, the team said. He will 
wear a brace and will not be able to put weight on the leg for 10 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Warren also is orthopedic surgeon for the New York Giants.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams joins backup center Jim McIlvaine on the injured list.  
Backup Rony Seikaly has seen limited action because of a foot 
injury. Williams had been playing with a broken nose and an injured 
thumb. 
</P>
<P>
	For Saturday's game, against Alonzo Mourning and the Miami Heat,  
the team will be using William Cunningham as center. Cunningham, 
playing on his second 10-day contract with the team, has played in 
four games. In his last outing, he committed three fouls in four 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're confident that Willie will be a bother to Mourning, and  
we're going to help him as much as possible,'' Casey said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he wasn't sure if the team would sign another player to  
help fill in at center. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Cunningham's fouling, Casey said it might not be as much  
of a problem against a big player. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's so eager, I can't fault him,'' Casey said, ``We use the  
phrase here `unintelligent hustle,' and that what's he's 
demonstrating. He's inexperienced ... but he's got the good reach 
for the rebound, and we're going to go with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problem with losing Williams, an acknowledged leader, may be  
as much psychological as physical. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard,'' Keith Van Horn said. ``What makes it the hardest  
is that he's already playing through so much this year with his 
thumb, and he is one person on this team who has given his all this 
year. It's tough to see him go through that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Van Horn was hopeful that the Nets could finish the season  
well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we can still get something out of the season,'' he  
said. ``I think regardless of our win-loss record, this is a 
talented team that is going to be reckoned with in the future. The 
more we can play together, the better we can be.''

<HEADLINE> 'Melissa' Virus Suspect Nabbed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A central New Jersey man was arrested by  
federal and state officials and charged with originating the e-mail 
virus known as Melissa, the state attorney general's office 
announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	David L. Smith, 30, of Aberdeen, was arrested Thursday night at  
his brother's house in nearby Eatontown, said Rita Malley, a 
spokeswoman for Attorney General Peter Verniero. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith originated the virus, which caused worldwide e-mail  
disruption this week, from his apartment in Aberdeen, Malley said. 
</P>
<P>
	He is charged with interfering with the public communication,  
which carries a sentence of five to 10 years in prison and up to a 
$150,000 fine, Verniero said. Smith was released on $100,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was snared with the help of America Online technicians,  
and a computer task force composed of federal and state agents, 
Malley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Verniero said authorities found Smith through ``good  
old-fashioned gumshoe police work,'' canvassing neighborhoods and 
identifying other family members who led them to Smith's brother's 
house. Verniero would not release the brother's name. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith cooperated with authorities when they arrived to arrest  
him, Verniero said. 
</P>
<P>
	An executive of a small software company in Cambridge, Mass.,  
told The Associated Press this week that he had found clues linking 
the virus to a writer who uses the computer handle ``VicodinES''. 
It was not immediately known if the suspect used that handle. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Smith, president of Phar Lap Software, a firm that makes  
operating systems and software tools, said he thinks the virus 
writer distributed it using an account stolen from America Online 
15 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Melissa appeared last Friday and spread rapidly around the world  
on Monday like a malicious chain letter, causing affected computers 
to fire off dozens of infected messages to friends and colleagues 
and swamping e-mail systems. 
</P>
<P>
	It disrupted the operations of thousands of companies and  
government agencies whose employees were temporarily unable to 
communicate by e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Verniero said David Smith was a network program for a company  
that did subcontracting for AT&AMP;T Corp. The company's name was not 
immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus arrives to its victims disguised as an e-mail from a  
friend, with a note in the subject line saying that an important 
document is attached. 
</P>
<P>
	The attachment is a Microsoft Word document that lists Internet  
pornography sites. Once the user opens the attachment, the virus 
digs into the user's address book and sends infected documents to 
the first 50 addresses. 
</P>
<P>
	A variation that appeared Tuesday -- carrying the name Melissa.A  
-- leaves the subject line blank, a change that can foil electronic 
filters meant to detect and delete the original virus-bearing 
message, according to Dan Schrader, director of product marketing 
for Trend Micro Inc., an antivirus company in Cupertino, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Another variant, ``Papa,'' attaches a Microsoft Excel  
spreadsheet document which, when opened, sends out 60 e-mails. 
However, Papa has bugs that sometimes prevent it from working. 
</P>
<P>
	The danger is that virus writers will find the variants on the  
Internet, correct the bugs and distribute them further.

<TEXT>
<P>
	President Clinton's Easter address to the nation:  
</P>
<P>
	Warm greetings to everyone celebrating Easter.  
</P>
<P>
	Today, Christians across America and around the world  
commemorate with great joy the central mystery of their faith: the 
Resurrection of Jesus. In this season, we celebrate Christ's 
victory over sin and death, and we rejoice in the new life that He 
won for us through His suffering, death, and rising from the dead. 
</P>
<P>
	That new life empowers us to overcome sin and to recognize our  
capacity for forgiveness and love. We have seen in our own 
communities and in other nations across the globe the violence and 
human tragedy spawned by hatred, intolerance, and fear born of 
ignorance. If we are to destroy the roots of hatred, we must 
examine our own hearts and actions and learn what we can and must 
do to build just communities united in understanding and mutual 
respect. May this sacred season of renewal, hope, and new 
beginnings inspire our efforts and light our way to a brighter, 
more peaceful future. 
</P>
<P>
	Hillary joins me in extending best wishes for a blessed and  
joyous Easter celebration.

<HEADLINE> Tech, Index Funds Lead 1st Quarter / Mutual Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology funds and stock index portfolios kept  
their dominant positions out front in the mutual-fund performance 
race through the first quarter of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Funds specializing in medium-sized to small stocks continued to  
struggle, as they have since early 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Extending a trend that has prevailed through much of the late  
1990s, Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index funds, up 4.79 percent, posted 
the best gain for the January-March period among broad stock-fund 
categories tracked by the research firm of Lipper Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Among specialized funds, science and technology funds, up 17.04  
percent, and telecommunications funds, up 16.37 percent, fared even 
better in the quarterly numbers made public by Lipper Friday. They 
thrived, as before, on the mania for Internet stocks and other 
companies riding the wave of technological innovation. 
</P>
<P>
	The S&AMP;P 500 funds outpaced growth funds, which gained 4.36  
percent, and capital appreciation funds, which rose 4.44 percent, 
by roughly half a percentage point. All those categories have a 
stake in the big blue-chip stocks heavily favored by investors in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, funds specializing in medium-sized to smaller  
stocks came in with negative numbers again after losing ground in 
1998. Mid-cap funds had a first-quarter decline of 0.35 percent; 
small-cap funds of 5.98 percent, and micro-cap funds of 1.82 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, funds that invest in bonds, or mix stocks and bonds  
together in their portfolios, generally showed only slight or no 
gains for the quarter, restrained by a February rise in interest 
rates that pushed bond prices lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Lipper's average of more than 2,000 domestic long-term  
fixed-income funds edged up 0.21 percent. Equity income funds 
slipped 0.39 percent; balanced funds rose 1.05 percent, and growth 
and income funds gained 1.77 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the international stock arena, Japanese funds, up 15.81  
percent, scored the best gains as the Tokyo market rallied on hopes 
that Japan might at last be ready to pull out of its long 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Latin American funds, up 11.56 percent, also enjoyed a  
double-digit rebound from 1998 losses. But European funds, coming 
off strong gains last year, slipped back 2.64 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, more than 1,660 world equity funds tracked by Lipper  
showed an average gain of 3 percent for the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Among domestic sector funds, natural resources funds gained 7.01  
percent with a boost from a late-March rally in world oil prices. 
But natural resources funds, down 4.62 percent, remained in a 
slump. 
</P>
<P>
	Some categories of funds that showed some life in the first  
quarter still have a lot of ground to make up from previous 
prolonged declines. The Japanese funds, for instance, still show an 
annualized loss of 4.05 percent over the past five years and have 
cost their owners 2.06 percent a year over the decade since March 
31, 1989, when the Japanese market was nearing a peak. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. stock funds, by contrast, boast extrordinary long-term  
records of prosperity. Lipper's tally of more than 3,900 domestic 
equity funds of all types shows a gain of 15.41 percent a year, on 
average, over the last 10 years, and 18.48 percent over the last 
five years.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Train Rams Car, Killing One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- An Amtrak train slammed into a car  
that had been pushed in its path, killing a passenger. Five people 
were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	No injuries were reported among the train passengers or crew in  
Thursday night's collision. The train was heading to Miami from New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	The car had stopped for flashing lights at the crossing when  
another car rammed it from behind, spinning the vehicle onto the 
tracks, where it stalled, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer Fuente, the 18-year-old who was killed, couldn't free  
herself from the car's back seat before the train slammed into the 
car, pushing it about more than a quarter-mile down the tracks. Two 
other people in her car were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The second car continued across the tracks and through the  
crossing. Three people in that car suffered minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	No tickets were issued, but the investigation was not complete.

<TEXT>
<P>
	CRANFORD, N.J. (AP) -- American Atheists Inc. is moving out of  
its longtime home in Austin, Texas, seeking a more civil and 
``progressive'' home in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	The nonprofit organization has bought a building in Cranford and  
plans to dedicate it on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Northeast is much more progressive than the South, which  
is the most religious area in the country but has a murder rate two 
to three times the national average,'' said Ron Barrier, the 
group's national spokesman. ``We feel the location is ideal for our 
political activism because of its proximity to Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American Atheists, dedicated to the separation of church and  
state, was founded in 1963 by Madalyn Murray O'Hair following the 
landmark Supreme Court decision that outlawed school prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. O'Hair mysteriously disappeared four years ago, along with  
her son, granddaughter and $500,000 from the organization's 
coffers. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities are investigating whether Ms. O'Hair's former office  
manager and a former prisonmate had any role in the disappearance.

	MOORCROFT, Wyo. (AP) -- The police chief was arrested and accused  
of moving from state to state to avoid paying $59,346 in child 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Anthony Franco allegedly has failed to make payments for  
his four children since his divorce in 1987. Franco lived in

<HEADLINE> Ill Grandmother Robbed Buying Pot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNABOW, N.C. (AP) -- At 53, Tinkey Mae Sullivan is a regular on  
the mean streets of Wilmington, where she ventures to buy 
marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wave at me when I go in there,'' she said Thursday,  
sitting in her double-wide mobile home in rural Brunswick County. 
``They all call me Grandma.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Usually Mrs. Sullivan goes alone to buy a quarter-ounce to an  
ounce of pot, which she says eases her rheumatoid arthritis and her 
other ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	But a week ago, she decided to make a pot run with her  
13-year-old grandson in the car. Both were robbed and attacked, and 
now police are considering filing charges against her from bringing 
the child along. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Detective O.D. Horton said police were shocked by Mrs.  
Sullivan's actions -- most significantly, that she took her grandson 
with her. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the issue I'm going to address first of all,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Sullivan, who with her husband has taken care of Chris  
since he was 3 days old, had him along while running errands March 
26 because he had been suspended from school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I left the bank, and it hit my mind, `Why don't I just ride by  
there and see if I can get some stuff,''' she said. Chris didn't 
know why she was there, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She made the 15-mile trip to Wilmington and circled through the  
neighborhood, then parked when two men indicated they had something 
to sell. Instead, they jumped in the back seat and attacked Mrs. 
Sullivan and Chris, taking more than $100 in cash, her grandson's 
wallet and her purse, wallet and credit cards. She called for help 
from her cell phone. 
</P>
<P>
	A proponent for the legalization of marijuana defended Mrs.  
Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly you're not contributing to the delinquency of a minor  
if what you're doing is trying to get drugs that are in some cases 
lifesaving and relieve pain and suffering,'' said Keith Stroup, 
executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of 
Marijuana Laws in Washington, D.C. ``It's almost a human right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1996, voters in six Western states have legalized  
medicinal use of pot, but patients could face prosecution under 
federal law if they use marijuana. North Carolina has not approved 
use of pot for medical purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite her harrowing experience and brush with the law, Mrs.  
Sullivan said she won't stop using marijuana. Asked if she has any 
marijuana now, she shook her head sadly. 
</P>
<P>
	And when will she buy more? ``The first chance I get.''

<HEADLINE> Sanctions Imposed on Russia Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has  
decided to impose sanctions on three Russian firms involved in the 
sale of anti-tank guided missiles to Syria, the State Department 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The sanctions involve a ban on purchases from and exports to the  
three firms and also suspends U.S. assistance to them. The amount 
of the aid was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said Albright could  
have cut up to $90 million in assistance to the Russian government 
but decided against doing so because she believed it would not 
serve U.S. national interests. 
</P>
<P>
	The law applicable to such cases is invoked when sales of lethal  
equipment are made to countries on the State Department's terrorism 
list. Syria is one of seven countries on the list. 
</P>
<P>
	The three firms are the Tula Design Bureau, the Volsk Mechanical  
Plant and the Tsniitochmash plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The measures will remain in place until one year after the  
transfers have ceased or until the secretary determines that it is 
important to U.S. interests to waive them, Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> Sumitomo Corp. To Report Huge Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's Sumitomo Corp., a major trading company,  
expects to report a loss of 23 billion yen, or $192 million, for 
its recently-completed fiscal year due to 125 billion yen in 
one-time charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised forecast was a big change from the company's  
previous estimate that it would earn 16 billion yen, or $133 
million, for the year that ended Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sumitomo, an importer and exporter of steel, chemicals and a  
wide range of other goods, is stepping up its efforts to get rid of 
risky assets and focus only on its most profitable businesses, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sumitomo will set aside 70 billion yen, or $583 million, to  
cover losses it expects to incur from shutting or selling 
unprofitable operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will also set aside 25 billion yen, or $208 million,  
for bad loans to Southeast Asia, and 7 billion yen, or $58 million, 
for early-retirement packages for about 150 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Sumitomo also said it would post a one-time loss of 23 billion  
yen, or $192 million, for bad securities investments. 
</P>
<P>
	To cover some of the charges, Sumitomo will sell real estate in  
Osaka to Sumitomo Life Insurance Co. for 20 billion yen, or $167 
million.

<HEADLINE> Congress Resists Recycling Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a subterranean room of a House office  
building, bales of trash that mix high-grade white paper with lunch 
leftovers serve as a testament to Congress' failed efforts to start 
an effective recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers who support recycling are frustrated that some of  
their colleagues reject the program outright, while others back the 
effort halfheartedly. The failure to separate garbage from 
recycling material is the byproduct of an institution where the 535 
lawmakers set the rules for each individual office and committee, 
backers of the program said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most stubborn bureaucracy in America is Congress itself,''  
said Rep. Sam Farr, D-Calif., a recycling supporter. ``There's 
never been an attitude that we should have to do that. No one is 
responsible inside an office. Some offices take it seriously and 
some don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even the House chairman who oversees environmental issues on  
public lands has turned his back on the effort. Rep. Don Young, 
R-Alaska, said his office once separated recyclables only to see 
the effort come to nothing because of sloppy practices. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the time, the garbage was being separated by our office. It  
was later then placed in the same garbage bag by the cleaning 
folks, and it didn't seem as if it was being recycled,'' the 
chairman of the House Resources Committee said through a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	High-grade white paper, the most lucrative product to recycle,  
isn't being widely sorted. For instance, the House earned $25,000 
for that recycling in fiscal 1998 -- far short of the $150,000 that 
could have been earned if 60 percent of the product was sorted, 
according to the chamber's former recycling coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	The recycling difficulties are the latest example of a Congress  
having trouble following the laws and regulations that apply to the 
rest of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, The Associated Press reported that inspectors  
appointed to ensure Congress obeys the same workplace safety rules 
as corporate America found numerous violations, including 
unprotected workers digging through contaminated trash, high 
concentrations of Legionnaires' disease bacteria in one building 
and improper storage of flammable chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	Many U.S. cities and counties, as well as the executive branch  
of the federal government, require recycling. But Congress has kept 
its program voluntary. The recycling effort is under control of the 
architect of the Capitol, whose 2,000 employees maintain 
congressional buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1997 survey of the 435 House offices found that nearly a dozen  
refused to participate and that many others failed to keep their 
promise. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is, it's a totally voluntary program,'' said Herb  
Franklin, administrative assistant in the architect's office. To 
enforce recycling, he said, ``you would have to have policing, and 
what would you do if people didn't comply? What are we supposed to 
do if an apple core is in a container with white paper?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, the architect's office is trying again. In a pilot  
project started last August and set to expand, some offices have 
been given separate containers for high-grade white paper, a 
lower-grade mixed paper, cans and bottles and pure garbage. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of Congress' mixed trash is now compressed and taken away  
by a recycling company, which pays for sorted white paper but 
nothing for material that is ``contaminated'' with garbage. 
</P>
<P>
	The House earned only $959 in fiscal 1996 from recycled paper,  
and that total fell to a minuscule $7.51 in fiscal 1997 before 
rebounding to more than $25,000 in fiscal 1998, said the General 
Services Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 improvement came after the House, in August 1997, hired  
a former paper industry consultant, Patricia Dollar, to be its 
recycling coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	In an internal report in late 1997, Ms. Dollar said Congress  
could have earned $150,000 that year if 60 percent of its 
high-grade paper had been recycled at market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ms. Dollar never met that goal. She was fired in February  
1998 from her $25,600 position after seven months on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	She alleged in an interview she was dismissed after refusing a  
superior's order to use ``evasive'' language in response to a 
congressman's complaints about problems in the recycling effort. 
The architect's office declined to address her allegation, citing 
ongoing litigation involving Ms. Dollar.

<HEADLINE> CDC Lauds Anti-Smoking Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Florida experienced the largest annual drop in  
teen-age smoking in nearly two decades after launching a $70 
million anti-tobacco campaign aimed at children, federal health 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoking dropped 19 percent among middle schoolers and 8 percent  
among high schoolers between February 1998 and February 1999, the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline was the largest nationwide since 1980.  
</P>
<P>
	Florida's aggressive anti-smoking campaign, which began last  
April, includes vigorous enforcement of smoking age limits and 
broadcast and print ads, produced with the help of teen-agers, that 
poke fun at the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC said higher cigarette prices also may have lowered the  
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of Florida middle-school students who reported having  
smoked cigarettes declined from 18.5 percent to 15 percent. 
Cigarette use among high schoolers dropped from 27.4 percent to 
25.2 percent during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar declines were found with cigar and smokeless tobacco.  
Middle school students using cigars dropped from 14.1 percent to 
11.9 percent and those using smokeless tobacco decreased from 6.9 
percent to 4.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Cigar and smokeless tobacco use dipped only slightly among high  
schoolers.

<P>
	The study was based on 1998 and 1999 Florida Department of  
Health surveys of about 20,000 public school students.

<P>
	``These results show why every state should have a comprehensive  
program to reduce youth smoking and why I oppose any legislation 
waiving the federal government's claim to tobacco settlement funds 
without making a commitment from the states to fund such efforts,'' 
President Clinton said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were released as state lawmakers are debating  
whether to reduce funding for the campaign in the fiscal year that 
starts July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jeb Bush and the Florida Senate have proposed spending  
about $61 million on the program, a cut of $9 million. The state 
House, however, had proposed slashing the budget by more than half, 
to $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads run in Florida's so-called ``Truth'' campaign have  
pushed the edge of taste, in the minds of some critics. 
</P>
<P>
	One had a chubby man lounging in a woman's swimsuit, smoking a  
cigarette, with the caption, ``No wonder tobacco executives have to 
hide behind sexy models.'' Another features youngsters making prank 
calls to tobacco executives. 
</P>
<P>
	Another ad portrayed a chic Academy Awards-like event ``in  
downtown Hades'' where an award for most deaths in a single year is 
up for grabs among Suicide, Illicit Drugs, Tobacco and Murder. In 
the audience are infamous killers such as Adolf Hitler and Josef 
Stalin. 
</P>
<P>
	When Tobacco, represented by a clean-cut executive type, wins  
the award, he exclaims: ``I want to thank all you smokers out 
there. This one is for you.''

<HEADLINE> Some Want Allies To Contribute More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Italy and France are contributing about 40  
warplanes apiece to the NATO war effort in Yugoslavia, while the 
Netherlands is providing 16 F-16 jet fighters, Turkey has chipped 
in 11, Belgium 10, Norway six. All told, America's NATO allies have 
earmarked more than 200 planes to operation Allied Force, roughly 
the same as the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some analysts feel the United States is shouldering a  
disproportionate share of NATO's burden, both in the current effort 
and in general. Some even believe the Europeans ought to deal with 
the Kosovo problem with no effort at all by Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sooner or later, we have to say (to the Europeans) that if the  
Russians attack, we are with you. But the brush fires are your 
responsibility,'' said David Acheson, president and chief executive 
officer of the Atlantic Council, a pro-NATO grouping. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon defends the American role in the air war and the  
European contribution to it, and does not consider the U.S. 
contribution disproportionate. 
</P>
<P>
	Helmut Sonnenfeldt, who monitors NATO issues from the Brookings  
Institution, says the equivalency in the number of planes between 
the U.S. and its allies in the Balkan war effort overstates the 
allies' contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	This comparison, he says, fails to account for the  
sophistication of some of the American aircraft -- each 
high-performance F-117 bomber costs $45 million, for example -- 
compared with the Europeans' planes, mostly the far cheaper F-16's. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Tomas Valasek of the Center for Defense Information:  
``Nobody has what the U.S. has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sonnenfeldt also notes that only Britain among the European  
allies is capable of firing a sea-based cruise missile. The U.S. 
has six cruise missile-capable vessels deployed for Yugoslavia 
duty. 
</P>
<P>
	For some allied countries, participation in the Yugoslav war  
effort is out of the question. Luxembourg, for example, has no air 
force. Iceland has no military at all. 
</P>
<P>
	France's military budget, at $47 billion, is second among NATO  
allies to that of the United States, at $267 billion. Germany is 
third at $42 billion, according to CIA estimates. Given this 
century's history, there is little sympathy on either side of the 
Atlantic for a significant increase in German defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Deciding just how much each NATO country should contribute to  
the alliance has never been an exact science. The United States 
spends about 3.4 percent of its gross national product on defense 
while the remaining allies spend an average of about 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Europeans can justify the discrepancy by pointing out that  
the United States has security responsibilities well beyond Europe 
-- Japan and the Korean peninsula being the most noteworthy 
examples. 
</P>
<P>
	A counterargument is that the United States has only slightly  
more than half of the population of its 18 NATO allies combined yet 
the defense spending of these allies amounts to only about 60 
percent of the U.S. defense budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Acheson, son of the late Dean Acheson, a NATO founding father  
and former secretary of state, likens Europe to a dependent 
incapable of acting alone. 
</P>
<P>
	The Europeans ``ought to provide the forces, capability and the  
money to keep order in Europe,'' said Acheson, emphasizing that he 
was speaking for himself and not his organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Europeans lack the will because they always have looked to  
the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Kupchan, of the Council on Foreign Relations, says it's  
illusory to suppose the Europeans could handle the Yugoslavia 
operation on their own, saying they lack the intelligence 
capabilities and satellite reconnaissance. 
</P>
<P>
	Another source of concern is that the Europeans are reducing  
their defense spending while the Clinton administration, after 
slashing military spending for years, is planning sizable 
increases. This, presumably, will accelerate European dependence on 
its big neighbor to the West. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonnenfeldt says European defense thinking is still largely  
based on the Cold War era concept that large armies are needed to 
ward off a ground invasion from the East. 
</P>
<P>
	But he says he is encouraged by a British-French initiative that  
would let European Union countries act independently while 
retaining their role within NATO. The initiative was a recognition 
of Europe's need to handle crises when the United States does not 
get involved. Washington has welcomed the plan enthusiastically.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Appeals Internet Porn Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Justice Department on Friday appealed a  
judge's ruling that blocked enforcement of a federal Internet 
pornography law. 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers had until Friday to decide whether to appeal  
U.S. District Judge Lowell A. Reed's Feb. 1 preliminary injunction 
barring enforcement of the Child Online Protection Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The law, signed into law by President Clinton last year, would  
require commercial Web sites to collect a credit card number or 
some other access code as proof of age before allowing Internet 
users to view online material deemed ``harmful to minors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First-time violators would face maximum criminal penalties of  
six months in jail and $50,000 in fines. Repeat violators would 
face an additional $50,000 a day in fines. The law also provides 
for civil penalties of up to $50,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's action moves the case to a three-judge panel of the  
Third Circuit Court of Appeals, said Justice Department spokeswoman 
Chris Watney. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department argued during the six-day hearing in  
January that the law is a sensible way to keep Internet pornography 
away from children. 
</P>
<P>
	But the ACLU contended the measure violates the First  
Amendment's free speech guarantees and could be used to unfairly 
prosecute gays and lesbians, AIDS activists or doctors distributing 
gynecological information. 
</P>
<P>
	The law is the second major effort by Congress to protect  
children from Internet pornography after the U.S. Supreme Court 
struck down the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which would 
have applied to both commercial and non-commercial Web sites.

<HEADLINE> France's BNP Eyes Other Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French banking group Banque Nationale de Paris said  
Friday it is open to discussions with rival banks Societe Generale 
and Paribas, which it is attempting to buy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are open to dialogue,'' BNP Chairman Michel Pebereau said  
in an interview with the French daily Le Figaro. ``Each party must 
be able to express itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Societe Generale and Paribas have repeatedly pledged to fight a  
hostile takeover attempt by BNP despite regulatory approval for 
BNP's $37 billion bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-way merger put forward by BNP would create a $1  
trillion, world-leading banking group. It comes as European banks 
are joining forces to better compete in a market transformed by the 
region's new common currency, the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	Pebereau reiterated in the interview that he is offering the two  
banks a merger of equals, and an opportunity to compete worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the advent of the euro, it is necessary to create a bank  
that will rank among world leaders -- for the French banking 
industry, but also for the national economy and for Paris' 
financial center,'' Pebereau said. 
</P>
<P>
	A commission that monitors the French stock market ruled Monday  
that BNP's takeover plan contained all the necessary information 
for the tender offer to move forward. The ruling came soon after a 
regulatory subcommittee of the Bank of France said BNP has the 
right to take over at least 50.01 percent of the other two French 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Societe Generale and Paribas were completing a $17.2 billion  
friendly merger of their own when BNP stunned the European 
financial world on March 9 with an unsolicited takeover bid for 
both banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The two takeover targets have maintained that overlap between  
the retail banking networks of BNP and Societe Generale would lead 
to branch closures and large-scale layoffs.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Fed Taxes Too Complicated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREDERICKSBURG, Va. (AP) -- Whether they get money back or have  
to write checks to the IRS, most Americans think the federal tax 
system is too complicated, according to an Associated Press poll. 
</P>
<P>
	And the proportion who feel that way has grown significantly  
over the last three years to nearly two-thirds, the poll indicated. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internal Revenue Service acknowledges that an array of new  
tax credits, deductions and other changes in the law has lengthened 
by several hours the time it takes to complete an itemized return. 
</P>
<P>
	In a poll conducted for the AP by ICR of Media, Pa., 66 percent  
said the federal tax system is too complicated, and 28 percent said 
it's not. Three years ago, just under half in an AP poll said the 
tax system was too complicated. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half those surveyed, 56 percent, now pay someone else  
to do their tax returns, while 40 percent said they do their taxes 
themselves, the poll indicated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the average taxpayer should have to ... deal  
with the expense of having somebody else do their taxes,'' said 
John T. Adlon, a 60-year-old electrician in Fredericksburg, midway 
between Washington, D.C., and Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	A decade ago, said Pete Sepp, a spokesman for the National  
Taxpayers Union, the number who paid for tax help was a large 
portion of the population but was still a minority. 
</P>
<P>
	In the new poll, just over half said they think a flat tax would  
be a fairer way to tax Americans, while about four in 10 disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
	One-third of those polled said they would be willing to give up  
deductions to simplify the tax code, but people expecting refunds 
are less likely to want to do that. 
</P>
<P>
	Tax experts say the increasing number of people who have  
investments in the stock market has influenced the number who need 
professional tax help. 
</P>
<P>
	H&AMP;R Block, the nation's largest tax preparation business,  
reported this week that revenues rose nearly 20 percent in the 
first quarter compared with the corresponding period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The deadline for filing tax returns is April 15, unless a  
taxpayer files an extension request. 
</P>
<P>
	Major problems for people who call H&AMP;R Block offices are tax  
credits for children, tax credits for education and capital gains 
taxes, said Linda McDougall, a spokeswoman for the Kansas City, 
Mo., company. Most of the rise in revenues is linked to additional 
business, not fee increases, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	H&AMP;R Block has targeted its advertising at the growing confusion  
faced by the public with ads asking: ``We know. Do you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS had to develop 11 new forms and revise 177 others just  
for this year as President Clinton and Congress pushed new tax 
credits for specific groups, changes in deductions and capital 
gains laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The complexity has driven Charles Embrey, a 40-year-old  
Fredericksburg factory worker, to start paying for tax help in 
recent years. Replacing the current system of graduated taxes with 
a flat tax is a tempting way to make things easier, he said, but he 
suspects a flat-tax system would go too easy on the rich. 
</P>
<P>
	``With my income, I don't prefer a flat tax,'' he said. ``They  
charge me one rate and somebody making $70,000 or $80,000 a year 
would pay the same rate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six out of 10 in the AP poll said they expect to get a refund,  
while just over one-fourth say they must pay more than was taken 
out of their paychecks. A majority of both those who have to pay 
and those who are owed money by the IRS agreed that the system is 
too complicated. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll of 1,012 people was taken March 26-30 and has an error  
margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax system is likely to just keep getting more complex, said  
J.D. Foster, executive director of the Tax Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not much going on to go in the opposite direction,''  
Foster said, although he noted the growing popularity of computer 
tax preparation programs has helped some. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean MacDonald, a 29-year-old librarian from Bloomington, Ill.,  
and her sister, Maggie Bromenshenkel, a 34-year-old bank official 
from nearby Warrenton, complained the increasing tax credits are 
more political than helpful to them. They both want a simpler tax 
system, preferably a flat tax. 
</P>
<P>
	``We agree on something,'' Ms. Bromenshenkel exclaimed,  
laughing. ``We're sisters, and we hardly ever agree on anything.''

<HEADLINE> Duke's Brand Named Player of Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Duke's Elton Brand collected another player  
of the year honor Friday, winning the John R. Wooden Award as 
college basketball's top player. 
</P>
<P>
	The sophomore center who led the Blue Devils to the NCAA  
tournament title game had already been honored by The Associated 
Press, the Atlanta Tipoff Club, the United States Basketball 
Writers Association and the Atlantic Coast Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``My name will go down in history with these individual  
accolades, but if you could win with your team, it's so special,'' 
he said after accepting the trophy at the Los Angeles Athletic 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand received 4,312 points in a nationwide vote of  
sportscasters and sportswriters. He finished 696 points ahead of 
Andre Miller of Utah, who had 3,616 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami of Ohio's Wally Szczerbiak was third with 3,108 points,  
followed by Mateen Cleaves of Michigan State (2,964) and Richard 
Hamilton (2,865), whose Connecticut team defeated Brand and Duke 
77-74 in Monday night's NCAA championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was hard to sleep that night because we were so close. I  
ran about a thousand plays through my head that I could have done 
to help win the game,'' Brand said. ``Then when I did sleep the 
next day I was dreaming of winning it. That's going to stick with 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton admitted he's still living the dream of winning the  
NCAA title, and wasn't disappointed to finish fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll take a national championship over anything,'' he said.  
``You can always win an MVP trophy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brand became the only sophomore winner in the Wooden Award's  
23-year history. He's the third consecutive ACC player to win, 
joining last year's honoree Antawn Jamison of North Carolina and 
Wake Forest's Tim Duncan in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand averaged 17.8 points and 9.8 rebounds for the Blue Devils,  
who finished 37-2, including a perfect record in ACC play. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand said he has no timetable for a decision on whether he'll  
stay in college or enter the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not in any rush,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Wooden described Brand as ``a very nice young man'' who should  
stay in school. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he goes pro, the only thing that would be beneficial about  
it is money, and that'll all get away in time,'' said Wooden, who 
coached UCLA to 10 national championships. ``He'd be sacrificing 
two of the most wonderful years of his life with people his own 
age. Almost any youngster would be better to finish school.''

<HEADLINE> Orioles' Brady Is No Playboy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- This is the image Brady Anderson conveys: a  
talented baseball player whose stylish sideburns, coy smile and 
chiseled body allow him to enjoy his status as a lifelong bachelor 
to the absolute fullest. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the real Brady Anderson: a talented baseball player who  
dates one woman at a time, rarely frequents nightclubs and often 
wonders how great it would be to be a doting father. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, the starting center fielder for the Baltimore Orioles,  
can't step onto the diamond without drawing screams from young 
women who almost swoon if he glances in their direction. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been that way ever since he made a splash years ago with  
those fashionable sideburns that appeared to be right out of 
``Beverly Hills 90210.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Truth is, Anderson has never seen the show. And, contrary to  
popular belief, his life has never been the stuff of prime-time 
soap operas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certain images people have, they're not always accurate. It  
was fun, though. It wasn't something I was opposed to,'' he said 
this week. ``But I'm much more serious than people think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For years, Anderson had a relationship with a model who spoke  
four languages. He is now serious about South African tennis star 
Amanda Coetzer, whom he has been dating since October. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to be with one girl,'' he said. ``I find it  
infinitely more appealing to be with one woman instead of several 
random ones. That's a waste of time. I've always felt that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Baltimore clubhouse after home games, Anderson often  
jokes with the kids of many of his teammates. There are times when 
he's almost jealous of players who get the opportunity to show 
their children what daddy does for a living. 
</P>
<P>
	``My career has impeded certain relationships, maybe because I  
let it,'' Anderson said. ``When I see the kids in the clubhouse, I 
know what a great thing that must be for the children and for the 
parent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've thought it would be nice to have my son and daughter  
around after a game. I guess I'm missing out on that,'' he said. 
``I wouldn't look at as a distraction at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Anderson, 35, isn't counting on experiencing that thrill  
anytime soon -- if ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``The women I date are independent and have their own career,''  
Anderson said. ``Amanda would have a hard time in the third set, 
down 5-4 and five months pregnant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson traveled with Coetzer around the world during the  
offseason and talks with her daily. But that relationship hasn't 
pulled him away from his one true love -- baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson has virtually memorized his statistics since he broke  
into the majors with Boston in 1988. He knows exactly how many 
games he played in every one of his last seven seasons in Baltimore 
and can rattle off his power numbers and steals during that span. 
</P>
<P>
	He is defiantly proud of his 50-homer season in 1996 and is  
painfully aware he had to scramble to hit .236 last year after 
starting in a 4-for-63 funk because of injuries to his shoulder, 
knee, hand and neck. 
</P>
<P>
	He makes no apologies for his 1998 season, particularly because  
he still ended up scoring 84 runs, hitting 18 homers and stealing 
21 bases. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to say I was pleased with the year or had a good  
year, but I know what it took to get to the point that I did,'' 
Anderson said. ``Regardless of my performance, which can be many 
times disappointing to me, I've never been disappointed in my 
preparation and effort. Every season I've given my best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson is healthy now, and although the Orioles flirted with  
free agent center fielder Brian Jordan and toyed with the idea of 
using Delino DeShields as their new leadoff hitter, Anderson will 
be at the top of the order and in the middle of the outfield on 
opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's on a mission to get himself ready to go out and play,''  
Orioles manager Ray Miller said. ``He's taken more swings this 
spring than I can ever remember. I expect a big year out of him.''

<HEADLINE> Dead Transvestite's Boyfriend Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ABBEVILLE, Ga. (AP) -- A transvestite fatally beaten on a rural  
Georgia road told investigators before he died that his boyfriend 
was responsible for the attack, the sheriff said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tracey Thompson, 33, who often hitchhiked up and down Interstate  
75 in Georgia and Florida dressed as a woman, died in a hospital 
Tuesday from his injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was pretty much falling in and out of consciousness,''  
Sheriff Stacy Bloodsworth said Thursday. ``He said his boyfriend 
had beaten him.'' Thompson did not identify the boyfriend by name, 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said they don't know how or why Thompson ended up on  
a country road 10 miles east of I-75 where he was beaten with a 
baseball bat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Georgia Bureau of Investigation has been reviewing the case  
as a possibly hate-motivated crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know whether or not this had anything to do with his  
lifestyle,'' said Gary Rothwell of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	No arrests have been made in the case.

anything about the car accident that nearly killed him last month. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first public comments since crashing his sport utility  
vehicle into a bridge March 6, the 67-year-old country singer said 
initially he didn't even know why he was in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think all this medicine they're running through my body has  
blanked everything out so bad I can't remember nothing,'' Jones 
said Thursday morning on Nashville radio station WKDF. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was near death when he was brought to the hospital, but  
made a remarkable recovery and checked himself out 13 days later. 
</P>
<P>
	During the interview, Jones did not discuss the investigation  
into whether alcohol was a factor in his crash. A half-empty, 
half-pint of vodka was found in his vehicle. A grand jury is to 
hear evidence in the case next month.

<HEADLINE> Stanley Works Cuts in Connecticut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW BRITAIN, Conn. (AP) -- The Stanley Works is moving some  
hardware manufacturing out of the city and cutting about 400 at its 
headquarters here. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said Thursday that the cost of doing business at a  
100-year-old plant was the major reason for the moves. Some items 
now travel up to several miles through numerous multi-story 
buildings during production, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That infrastructure places us at a competitive disadvantage  
against the growing number of low-cost producers in the market,'' 
said John Trani, Stanley's chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Product lines including hinges, brackets, latches, and vent  
tubes will be relocated to other Stanley plants in Asia and North 
America, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first layoff notices are expected to go out in May or June,  
and the cuts will be completed by the end of the year, said company 
spokesman Vance Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley is in the midst of a major restructuring announced in  
July 1997 with plans to cut 4,500 jobs, or 24 percent of its 
worldwide work force, and close more than 50 of its 123 factories 
and distribution centers.

<HEADLINE> Tech, Index Funds Lead 1st Quarter / Mutual Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology funds and stock index portfolios kept  
their dominant positions out front in the mutual-fund performance 
race through the first quarter of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Funds specializing in medium-sized to small stocks continued to  
struggle, as they have since early 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Extending a trend that has prevailed through much of the late  
1990s, Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index funds, up 4.79 percent, posted 
the best gain for the January-March period among broad stock-fund 
categories tracked by the research firm of Lipper Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Among specialized funds, science and technology funds, up 17.04  
percent, and telecommunications funds, up 16.37 percent, fared even 
better in the quarterly numbers made public by Lipper Friday. They 
thrived, as before, on the mania for Internet stocks and other 
companies riding the wave of technological innovation. 
</P>
<P>
	The S&AMP;P 500 funds outpaced growth funds, which gained 4.36  
percent, and capital appreciation funds, which rose 4.44 percent, 
by roughly half a percentage point. All those categories have a 
stake in the big blue-chip stocks heavily favored by investors in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, funds specializing in medium-sized to smaller  
stocks came in with negative numbers again after losing ground in 
1998. Mid-cap funds had a first-quarter decline of 0.35 percent; 
small-cap funds of 5.98 percent, and micro-cap funds of 1.82 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, funds that invest in bonds, or mix stocks and bonds  
together in their portfolios, generally showed only slight or no 
gains for the quarter, restrained by a February rise in interest 
rates that pushed bond prices lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Lipper's average of more than 2,000 domestic long-term  
fixed-income funds edged up 0.21 percent. Equity income funds 
slipped 0.39 percent; balanced funds rose 1.05 percent, and growth 
and income funds gained 1.77 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the international stock arena, Japanese funds, up 15.81  
percent, scored the best gains as the Tokyo market rallied on hopes 
that Japan might at last be ready to pull out of its long 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Latin American funds, up 11.56 percent, also enjoyed a  
double-digit rebound from 1998 losses. But European funds, coming 
off strong gains last year, slipped back 2.64 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, more than 1,660 world equity funds tracked by Lipper  
showed an average gain of 3 percent for the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Among domestic sector funds, natural resources funds gained 7.01  
percent with a boost from a late-March rally in world oil prices. 
But real estate funds, down 4.62 percent, remained in a slump. 
</P>
<P>
	Some categories of funds that showed some life in the first  
quarter still have a lot of ground to make up from previous 
prolonged declines. The Japanese funds, for instance, still show an 
annualized loss of 4.05 percent over the past five years and have 
cost their owners 2.06 percent a year over the decade since March 
31, 1989, when the Japanese market was nearing a peak. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. stock funds, by contrast, boast extrordinary long-term  
records of prosperity. Lipper's tally of more than 3,900 domestic 
equity funds of all types shows a gain of 15.41 percent a year, on 
average, over the last 10 years, and 18.48 percent over the last 
five years.

<HEADLINE> France's BNP Eyes Other Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French banking group Banque Nationale de Paris said  
Friday it is open to discussions with rival banks Societe Generale 
and Paribas, which it is attempting to buy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are open to dialogue,'' BNP Chairman Michel Pebereau said  
in an interview with the French daily Le Figaro. ``Each party must 
be able to express itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Societe Generale and Paribas have repeatedly pledged to fight a  
hostile takeover attempt by BNP despite regulatory approval for 
BNP's $37 billion bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-way merger put forward by BNP would create a $1  
trillion, world-leading banking group. It comes as European banks 
are joining forces to better compete in a market transformed by the 
region's new common currency, the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	Pebereau reiterated in the interview that he is offering the two  
banks a merger of equals, and an opportunity to compete worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the advent of the euro, it is necessary to create a bank  
that will rank among world leaders -- for the French banking 
industry, but also for the national economy and for Paris' 
financial center,'' Pebereau said. 
</P>
<P>
	A commission that monitors the French stock market ruled Monday  
that BNP's takeover plan contained all the necessary information 
for the tender offer to move forward. The ruling came soon after a 
regulatory subcommittee of the Bank of France said BNP has the 
right to take over at least 50.01 percent of the other two French 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Societe Generale and Paribas were completing a $17.2 billion  
friendly merger of their own when BNP stunned the European 
financial world on March 9 with an unsolicited takeover bid for 
both banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The two takeover targets have maintained that overlap between  
the retail banking networks of BNP and Societe Generale would lead 
to branch closures and large-scale layoffs.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Lawyer Protests Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAKERSFIELD, Calif. (AP) -- Timothy Liebaert and his wife thought  
their seven-month search for a new home was over. 
</P>
<P>
	But the couple was crushed later when they learned the dream  
house was no longer theirs. 
</P>
<P>
	All, says Liebaert, because he's a lawyer.  
</P>
<P>
	Liebaert has sued Burlington Homes, claiming the Bakersfield  
developer discriminates against lawyers in violation of state civil 
rights laws. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had put a deposit on a lot in a Burlington  
subdivision for a five-bedroom house. During a meeting with a 
company employee to discuss color schemes, kitchen tiles and 
similar items, Liebaert said he casually mentioned his law 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after that, the company canceled his contract, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were shocked. But we were reluctant to believe it and we  
didn't believe it,'' Liebaert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Greg Judkins, who represents Burlington, declined  
comment, saying he has not yet seen the suit. But a March 15 letter 
to Liebaert from Judkins' firm states Burlington's no-lawyers 
policy is a legitimate way to protect the business. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's ``experience is that home buyers who are also  
lawyers threaten litigation (requiring significantly greater 
management time as well as legal fees and resolution costs) at a 
dramatically higher rate than home buyers who are not lawyers,'' 
the letter states.

<HEADLINE> Feds Subpeona Forman To Testify </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Former heavyweight champion George Foreman  
will likely testify later this month before a federal grand jury 
investigating boxing's sanctioning organizations, according to his 
lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman has been subpoenaed by the panel looking into corruption  
charges in boxing, Larry Wechsler said. 
</P>
<P>
	``My understanding is that George is just one small piece of  
this rather broad-ranging investigation,'' the Washington attorney 
told The Record of Hackensack. ``The government views him as a 
witness and a victim, and I assume they view other boxers in the 
same way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wechsler said he didn't know whether anyone had extorted money  
from Foreman to set up a fight or improve his ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	The 51-year-old former champion, a familiar figure in TV  
commercials, was initially scheduled to appear before the grand 
jury on Wednesday, but would likely testify later this month, said 
Wechsler. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources told The Record the grand jury is investigating whether  
the New Jersey-heaquartered International Boxing Federation sold 
rankings and arranged fights in return for kickbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The payments, sometimes disguised as consulting fees, were made  
by fighter managers, to promoters and sanctioning groups, according 
to unnamed sources cited by The Star-Ledger of Newark, which 
disclosed the investigation last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal grand jurors have subpoenaed all IBF records since 1982  
on rankings and contracts for fights, as well as checks, invoices, 
expense forms and telephone records, said IBF attorney Walter 
Stone. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want virtually all written records since the start of the  
organization,'' Stone said. ``Whatever the IBF has, that's what the 
U.S. Attorney's Office is going to get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors declined comment on the investigation.  
</P>
<P>
	The IBF also came under scrutiny last month from law enforcement  
agencies in New York following the controversial draw in the March 
13 heavyweight championship bout between Evander Holyfield and 
Lennox Lewis. Of the three judges, only the IBF-picked judge had 
Holyfield winning the fight many believed Lewis dominated. 
</P>
<P>
	The IBF and two other sanctioning groups -- the WBA and WBC -- by  
their rules and rankings, play a large role in determining whom a 
boxer fights. Boxers who defy the groups risk losing the chance to 
be declared a champion and earn large purses. 
</P>
<P>
	``How these different boxers are rated and whether they get to  
championship fights can be worth millions of dollars,'' Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
	IBF president Robert Lee has denied the allegations.  
</P>
<P>
	``For 15 years, people have been making allegations against Bob  
Lee that have proven false and hollow and gone absolutely 
nowhere,'' said Gerald Krovatin, Lee's attorney. ``I have no reason 
to believe that this investigation will be any different.''

<HEADLINE> Cases of Child Abuse on Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite a decline in the number of reported  
cases, nearly 1 million children are victims of abuse and neglect, 
according to the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Health and Human Services on Thursday said  
reported cases of child abuse, provided by the states, decreased 
for the fourth year in a row in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	But the states still found that 963,870 children were victims of  
abuse and neglect. There were nearly 3 million reports of alleged 
mistreatment investigated by child protective services. 
</P>
<P>
	``Though we're reporting a slight decline in children as victims  
of abuse and neglect, these numbers nevertheless represent an 
unacceptable human tragedy we must do more to prevent,'' HHS 
Secretary Donna Shalala said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents and relatives comprise the majority of those responsible  
for abuse and neglect, according to the HHS. Parents account for 75 
percent of perpetrators, relatives 10 percent and non-related 
individuals make up 6 percent of those responsible for 
maltreatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The department also stressed the link between substance abuse  
and child abuse. Substance abuse was a factor in one-third of all 
cases of child abuse and neglect. The HHS report recommended closer 
coordination between the child protection and substance abuse 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Families where there is child abuse and neglect often face  
multiple problems that require comprehensive solutions,'' said 
Nelba Chavez, administrator of the Substance Abuse and Mental 
Health Services Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures are based on reported cases, and the department  
noted that separate studies have found that the number of victims 
may be higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, a private group that works against child  
abuse came out with a report that found a slight increase in 
reports of child abuse. In 1988, there were nearly 2.3 million 
reports of child abuse, which grew to nearly 3.2 million by 1997, 
according to the report by Prevent Child Abuse America, which bases 
its numbers partly on projections. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is getting safer except for our children,'' said  
Kevin Kirkpatrick, spokesman for the group, which has just changed 
its name from the National Committee to Prevent Child Abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of National Child Abuse and Neglect Prevention Month in  
April, the HHS plans to distribute information packets to child 
welfare agencies and community groups. The prevention material can 
also be obtained by calling the National Clearinghouse on Child 
Abuse and Neglect at 1-800-FYI-3366.

<HEADLINE> FCC Approves Satellite TV Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A merger between two big satellite TV  
companies has won approval by federal regulators with the hope that 
the deal will bring more competition to cable TV providers. 
</P>
<P>
	The action Thursday by the Federal Communications Commission's  
International Bureau cleared the way for DirecTV to buy United 
States Satellite Broadcasting Co., its main programming affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, valued at $1.3 billion when it was announced in  
December, would create a powerful force in the delivery of 
television beamed directly to American homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies provide TV programming to customers who use  
pizza-sized dishes mounted outdoors to receive the signals. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC's action coincided with the first day of cable TV  
deregulation, which lifts limits on what cable companies can charge 
customers wanting to watch many of their favorite cable channels. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators view satellite TV companies, which compete against  
local cable TV companies, as the best way of trying to check rising 
cable TV rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC concluded the satellite TV merger would serve the public  
interest by making the companies a stronger competitor to cable TV 
providers. 
</P>
<P>
	The end of federal price controls on cable TV ``makes it even  
more critical that we provide consumers with competitive 
alternatives to cable in the video programming market,'' FCC 
Chairman Bill Kennard said. 
</P>
<P>
	DirecTV President Eddy Hartenstein said the merger will let the  
company ``enhance our programming lineup, strengthen our 
competitive position against cable and allow us to deliver new 
services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase will expand DirecTV's 185-channel programming  
lineup to more than 210 channels. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC's approval removed the last major regulatory hurdle to  
the merger, which USSB shareholders still must approve. The 
companies hope to close the deal by midyear. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC did require DirecTV to offer programming on three  
satellite channels by Dec. 31, or risk losing them. The company is 
not now using those channels, but does plan to offer 
Spanish-language programming on them. 
</P>
<P>
	DirecTV has more than 4.7 million subscribers. USSB provides  
premium movie channels such as HBO and Showtime and pay-per-view 
programming -- usually as an add-on to DirecTV. USSB has about 2 
million subscribers, including 1.8 million who also subscribe to 
DirecTV.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Cycling Team Denies Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The manager of Belgium's Lotto cycling  
team on Friday dismissed claims of drug use made by the man at the 
center of last summer's Tour de France scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Willy Voet, former masseur of the French Festina team, was  
quoted in the Het Belang Van Limburg newspaper on Friday as saying 
a Spanish doctor working with the Lotto supplied him with the 
performance-enhancing drug EPO after Festina's supplies ran out 
during races last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I categorically deny the accusations, that were put forward in  
a perfectly gratuitous way without the slightest hint of 
evidence,'' Lotto team manager Jean-Luc Vandenbroucke. 
</P>
<P>
	Voet was suspended from cycling for three years for his part in  
the drug scandal overshadowed last year's Tour de France. He 
admitted Festina riders used banned drugs and is one of a dozen 
people under investigation by French courts. 
</P>
<P>
	In another case, it was reported that a package containing  
amphetamines intercepted by Belgian authorities this week was 
addressed to former world champion Gianni Bugno of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly I wasn't expecting anything like that and at this  
moment I can only say I'm completely extraneous to the affair,'' 
Bugno told the Italian news agency ANSA. 
</P>
<P>
	Bugno's former team, Mapei was pulled from a race in Belgium  
Thursday and questioned by police after the discovery of the 
package which was sent from the team's hotel in Kortrijk. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators released the team's riders and management Thursday  
night, saying there was no evidence linking them to the banned 
drugs. But an Italian member of the team's medical staff remained 
in custody. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Daniel Baal, president of the French Cycling  
Federation, was placed under investigation by a French judge in 
connection with the Tour de France scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Baal was charged with ``complicity to facilitate and incite  
doping,'' said his lawyer, Paul Mauriac. Baal, who says he has 
always tried to prevent drug use, was ``shocked'' by what he called 
an unjust decision.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Writer Seeks U.S. Asylum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WATERVILLE, Maine (AP) -- A Pakistani journalist who was  
imprisoned and accused of being a traitor in his homeland for 
exposing child-labor conditions said Friday he plans to seek 
political asylum in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Zafaryab Ahmed was allowed to leave Pakistan to fulfill a  
fellowship at Colby College. He was due back home March 2, when his 
90-day permit from Pakistan expired. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their objective is to break me. Now I'm here,'' he said. ``The  
Pakistani government can say nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ahmed, 45, faces sedition charges in Pakistan for his stories  
that exposed slave-like working conditions of children in Pakistan 
and attracted international attention. He was arrested in 1995 
after he wrote about the murder of a 12-year-old activist. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahmed was allowed to come to Colby College, a private liberal  
arts school in Waterville, in December after pressure from U.S. 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that if he returned home, he would not be allowed to  
work as a journalist or a human rights activist, and he would face 
constant surveillance. He said he is worried that his defection 
would endanger his mother, brother, sister and nephews and nieces 
in Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahmed's U.S. visa expires on May 23. But because he has filed  
for political asylum, he will be allowed to remain in the country 
until his case is reviewed by the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service.

<HEADLINE> Followers Concerned About Farrakhan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Officials in Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam  
say they're seriously concerned about the health of the man who has 
headed their organization for two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan is recovering from surgery he underwent Wednesday  
related to his prostate cancer. His chief of staff said then that 
Farrakhan's treatment ``continues to be successful and his 
prognosis is excellent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a Nation of Islam member, who spoke Thursday on condition of  
anonymity, said there are serious worries within the organization 
about Farrakhan's health. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nervousness,'' said the member, who requested  
anonymity. ``At this point, we are simply hoping for the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The source said members of the Nation of Islam recognized the  
gravity of the situation when Farrakhan's family accompanied him on 
this round of medical treatments. Farrakhan, his family -- including 
his wife, daughter and son-in-law -- and an entourage flew here 
Tuesday from Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Members were also stunned at how Farrakhan looked at an event in  
February, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post, quoting a source at Howard University  
Hospital where Farrakhan is being treated, said he remains in 
``very bad shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said he was rushed to Washington, bleeding and in  
great pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan, 65, was first treated for prostate cancer in 1991,  
using a hormonal therapy. Three years later, doctors began 
implanting bits of radioactive metal in a bid to kill cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan has 238 such seeds. Two weeks ago, his doctor, Abdul  
Alim Muhammad, said Farrakhan's score on a prostate specific 
antigen test has ranged from an ominous 16 to below one -- a level 
shown by men who are free of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Post reported that Farrakhan was again receiving the  
radioactive seed treatment this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan has been ill since early January with an undiagnosed  
condition, according to an article last month in Final Call, the 
Nation of Islam newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Final Call quoted the minister as saying in a Feb. 28 speech

	On Wednesday, civil rights leader Jesse Jackson revealed that  
Farrakhan had undergone surgery for his cancer.

	``Fortunately because he has kept up with it and maintained the  
discipline he's been able to more or less control it,'' Jackson 
said. ``And my sense is that the doctors today are satisfied with 
the effect of their work today. We can only pray and hope for the 
best results.''

<P>
	NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. (AP) -- Graenum Berger, an American credited  
with helping relocate tens of thousands of Ethiopian Jews to 
Israel, died Wednesday at his home in New Rochelle, N.Y. He was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger, a social worker who worked for the Federation of Jewish  
Philanthropies of New York, founded the American Association for 
Ethiopian Jews more than 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1960s Berger witnessed bigotry towards Ethiopian Jews, or  
Falashas, who lived in what he termed the most extreme poverty in 
the world. He sought to make American Jews aware of the problems 
faced by what has been called Ethiopia's Jewish tribe. 
</P>
<P>
	He lectured about the Falashas to American audiences, and was  
helped in his cause by the Israeli rabbinate's 1975 decision to 
legally recognize the Falashas as Jews. 
</P>
<P>
	The association lobbied Congress and Jewish groups to help the  
Falashas, and Berger called publicly for Israeli action. 
Large-scale airlifts were eventually organized by Israel in 1984 
and 1985, and again in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The end result of Berger's efforts was the establishment of a  
50,000 member Ethiopian Jewish community in Israel by 1993, and the 
virtual removal of all Jews from Ethiopia.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sheldon E. Kopp, a psychologist and author  
best known for his 1972 book ``If You Meet a Buddha on the Road, 
Kill Him,'' died of cardiac arrhythmia and pneumonia Monday. He was 
70. 
</P>
<P>
	Kopp was the author of 17 books, many of them written as guides  
to help readers discover importance in their own existence. 
</P>
<P>
	``If You Meet a Buddha on the Road, Kill Him'' examined the  
struggle to find meaning in oneself while relying less on spiritual 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	His other books include ``The Hanged Man'' (1974), ``The Hidden  
Meanings'' (1975), ``This Side of Tragedy'' (1977) and ``An End to

Pictures, died Sunday. He was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Perkins was a stunt double for Spencer Tracy, Yul Brenner and

</P>
<P>
	Perkins arrived in Hollywood in 1928 and got parts in movies

</P>
<P>
	In the 1950s and 1960s, Perkins was a familiar TV face with  
appearances ranging from ``Batman'' to ``The Virginian.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1960, he co-founded the Stuntmen's Association, which got  
stunt workers recognized as entertainers deserving the title of 
industry professionals.

Milwaukee Sentinel humor columns with donated jokes, newsy bits and 
examples of the twisted language called ``Milwaukee-ese,'' died 
Thursday. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
	Thien, who retired in 1994, was diagnosed in fall of 1997 with

retirement, packing the daily piece with puns, pet peeves, odd news 
items and gossip picked up around town.

<P>
	At the holidays, Thien would use several days worth of columns  
to list names of everyone who had contributed to his column or 
otherwise deserved to be recognized, in alphabetical order.

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Pursue Steel Complaints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. steel industry won a partial victory  
Friday as the government decided to pursue trade complaints against 
six of eight countries accused of illegally pricing cut-to-length 
steel plates. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases form the second round of complaints filed by major  
U.S. steel producers who have been struggling against a recent 
surge in steel imports. In the first round, the government is 
considering tariffs on hot-rolled carbon steel from Japan and 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. International Trade Commission voted to drop cases  
against the Czech Republic and Macedonia after finding their 
shipments of cut-to-length plates to be negligible -- less than 3 
percent of overall imports to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency, meanwhile, found evidence that shipments of that  
product from France, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan and South Korea 
have hurt U.S. producers, paving the way for a Commerce Department 
investigation that could lead to tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic steel producers and steelworkers have blamed the  
imports for thousands of layoffs and three U.S. company 
bankruptcies. 
</P>
<P>
	Although imports have since dropped, steel producers continue to  
press the administration and Congress for help. 
</P>
<P>
	The imports reached record highs last year as the Asian economic  
crisis reduced demand for steel abroad and forced foreign producers 
to turn to U.S. markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Curtis H. Barnette, chairman and chief executive of Bethlehem  
Steel Corp., called Friday's action affirmation ``that the steel 
crisis continues and that decisive, prompt and comprehensive action 
is required in response.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Japanese steel executive, Fujio Ono, has called the cases  
unjustified, saying market forces and not artificial trade 
practices were responsible for the import surge. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Bethlehem Steel, four other steel producers and the  
United Steelworkers of America accused the eight countries of 
illegally dumping cut-to-length steel in the United States at 
prices below production costs or home-market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	They also accused France, India, Indonesia, Italy, Macedonia and  
South Korea of unfairly subsidizing their producers to artificially 
lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department has until mid-May to issue a preliminary  
finding on subsidies and until late July to initially rule on 
dumping. 
</P>
<P>
	Cut-to-length plate, thicker than the widely used hot-rolled  
variety, is used in agricultural and construction equipment, 
bridges, ships, railcars and buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	In the hot-rolled cases, the Commerce Department has issued  
preliminary dumping findings against Japan, Russia and Brazil. 
Final rulings are expected by summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan and Brazil face tariffs of up to 71 percent if the  
findings are affirmed and found to threaten U.S. industry. Russia 
has reached a deal with the United States to avoid tariffs by 
voluntarily curtailing shipments.

<HEADLINE> Steinbrenner Calls Irabu 'Fat Toad' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Hideki Irabu didn't need his interpreter to  
tell him the Boss was mad. 
</P>
<P>
	George Steinbrenner thinks the Japanese pitcher is overweight  
and not hustling -- an embarrassment to baseball's most storied 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	As the New York Yankees owner sees it, Irabu is a ``fat ...  
toad.'' And he remained behind when the team left spring training 
Thursday, leaving his future unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	Disappointed with Irabu's lack of motivation and mental lapses  
all spring, the Yankees decided to see if some time away from the 
club might help the right-hander ``clear his mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll be staying here until Tuesday when he'll join the team  
in Oakland,'' Steinbrenner announced after long meetings with Irabu 
and general manager Brian Cashman following a 7-6 exhibition win 
over Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a slap on the wrist by any means, it's a decision I  
made,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But earlier, the Boss berated Irabu after he failed to cover  
first base in the ninth inning. Steinbrenner said Irabu weighed 252 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not covering first base, I don't know what you've got to do.  
That's not a Yankee,'' Steinbrenner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Irabu did the same thing in a start last weekend in a game  
against Philadelphia, infuriating the Yankees and leading to 
speculation that if he did something like that again, he'd start 
the year in the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he'll be Florida trying to get his body in shape and  
his mind focused. 
</P>
<P>
	``The season doesn't start until Monday and he'll be here. And  
while he's here we'll be able to make a decision accordingly,'' 
said Cashman, who said optioning Irabu to the minors or trading him 
were both possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Irabu entered the game in the sixth and pitched two solid  
innings before things unraveled for him with two outs in the ninth. 
Cleveland's Jolbert Cabrera hit a grounder that first baseman Clay 
Bellinger fielded while going to his right. 
</P>
<P>
	Irabu broke late toward first on the play, and by the time he  
got near the bag, Cabrera had already crossed it. Enrique Wilson 
followed with a two-run double and Irabu was pulled. 
</P>
<P>
	As he walked toward the dugout, Irabu looked as if he knew he  
was in trouble. The fans at Legends Field, aware of Irabu's lack of 
hustle and his shaky situation with club. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a late start on the play,'' Irabu said through his  
interpreter, George Rose. ``To be honest, I can't understand all 
the things being said about me these days -- `I don't have any guts, 
I don't have any fight in me.' People are judging me on one play, 
not the whole performance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not long after his comments, Irabu met in the coaches' office  
with Steinbrenner and Cashman while the rest of the Yankees waited 
in the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The team, which had a tumultuous training camp with the Roger  
Clemens-David Wells trade, manager Joe Torre's diagnosis with 
prostate cancer and Darryl Strawberry's comeback, was supposed to 
leave by bus for their charter flight to Los Angeles 45 minutes 
after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	But when it appeared the Irabu situation would delay their  
departure some of the players sat quietly eating pizza while others 
used the time to get in a quick workout. 
</P>
<P>
	The scene was so odd that the possibility of an April Fool's  
joke crossed everyone's minds. 
</P>
<P>
	When Steinbrenner gave the word that it was time to leave about  
an hour and 45 minutes after the game, pitcher David Cone shouted 
to his teammates, ``Let's hit the road, we're outta here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the Yankees hollered back, ``I'm not going.''  
</P>
<P>
	As it turns out, that was Irabu's fate -- one that he apparently  
asked for. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he wanted to stay behind,'' Steinbrenner said. ``I  
just feel this is something they and he needs right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner said the pitcher will spend the next five days  
working out at the Yankees' training complex under Billy Connors, 
the team's director of player personnel. Cashman said he would be 
staying in Florida as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner said he has no regrets about all the effort he and  
the Yankees have put into Irabu, signed after a drawn-out bidding 
war in 1997 to a four-year, $12 million contract. Irabu was 13-9 
with a 4.06 ERA last year, but did not pitch in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I really don't,'' he said. ``He was a great pitcher for us  
last year. We wouldn't have had the record we had last year without 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner said there are still some things to work out in the  
next few days with Irabu before he can rejoin the team Tuesday when 
the Yankees open the season against the Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to work on them,'' Steinbrenner said.  
</P>
<P>
	Irabu went 0-2 this spring with an 8.38 ERA in four starts and  
Thursday's relief outing. In 19 1-3 innings he allowed 30 hits, 18 
earned runs with nine walks and eight strikeouts.

<HEADLINE> Pavarotti Returns to Las Vegas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Famed tenor Luciano Pavarotti says he doesn't  
know quite what to expect when he performs for a third time in Las 
Vegas next week. 
</P>
<P>
	But he knows there will be some roulette tables waiting to take  
his money again. 
</P>
<P>
	Pavarotti is to make a rare appearance in this gambling capital  
April 10, christening the 12,000-seat Mandalay Bay Resort &AMP; Casino 
Events Center. The concert will be his first here since March 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	He recalls being ``very comfortable'' with his Las Vegas  
audiences, and in the casino -- at least for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won a couple thousand dollars at roulette,'' he recalled  
this week. ``Then I lost it, like everybody does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pavarotti, 63, is having a good 1999 after undergoing hip and  
knee replacement surgery last year. In addition to solo 
engagements, he performed in Tokyo on Jan. 9 with Placido Domingo 
and Jose Carreras.

	Belgrade Hit by NATO Airstrikes  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In the most dramatic attack yet in  
11 days of air raids, NATO fired cruise missiles into the heart of 
Yugoslavia's capital early Saturday, blasting the headquarters of 
security forces accused of waging a terror campaign to eradicate 
ethnic Albanians from Kosovo. The strikes signaled a promised 
escalation of the NATO air campaign intended to force Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic to accept a peace plan in the 
separatist province. It is the police of Serbia who are leading the 
campaign that has so far driven more than 200,000 ethnic Albanians 
from Kosovo.

	NATO Strikes Kosovo Targets  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO jets are trying to keep  
Yugoslav troops on the move and force them to waste precious fuel 
by continuing to pound targets in Kosovo. NATO has conceded that so 
far it has failed to stop Serb forces from expelling tens of 
thousands of Kosovo Albanians, but it insisted it would press on. 
Meanwhile, tens of thousands more refugees crossed borders out of 
the province, overwhelming local communities and relief agencies 
struggling to supply food, medicine and blankets.

	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Susan McDougal's defense got an unusual  
endorsement today from another woman charged by Kenneth Starr's 
prosecutors. Julie Hiatt Steele testified that she, too, was 
indicted because she refused to give false testimony against 
President Clinton. Ms. Steele has been charged with lying to grand 
jurors investigating former White House volunteer Kathleen Willey's 
claim that Clinton made an unwelcome sexual advance toward her in 
1993. Ms. Steele's testimony undercut part of Mrs. Willey's

	HAVANA (AP) -- Carrying large wooden crosses and singing hymns,  
several hundred Cuban Catholics walked slowly through the streets 
of the capital's Chinatown in a rare public procession in 
observance of Good Friday. Believers walked behind a group of 
children from Our Lady of Charity parish, dressed as Mary, Jesus, 
Roman soldiers and all the characters from a typical passion play. 
It was the second Good Friday in a row that the parish has 
organized Stations of the Cross since Pope John Paul II's historic

	'Melissa' Virus Suspect Nabbed  
</P>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- One week after the e-mail virus named  
``Melissa'' began swamping computers across the country, 
authorities arrested a man who is accused of creating the bug in 
his apartment and naming it for a topless dancer. David L. Smith, 
30, was charged with interruption of public communications, 
conspiracy and theft of computer service. He faces a maximum of 40 
years in prison and a $480,000 fine. Melissa appeared on March 26 
and spread rapidly around the world, slowing e-mail systems to a 
crawl. Government agencies, companies and thousands of other 
institutions have been affected.

	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- A military jury today issued the first  
punishment against an aviator involved in the Italian ski gondola 
accident, kicking the jet's navigator out of the Marines for 
destroying a videotape shot during the fatal flight. Capt. Joseph 
Schweitzer had pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and 
conspiracy -- charges that carried up to 10 years in prison. He 
admitted throwing the personal tape into a fire two days after his

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serb officials began gathering

investigating judge said ``court proceedings'' began today and that 
``more detailed information will be known Saturday,'' Tanjug said. 
Judge Jovica Jovanovic did not say how long the preliminary phase

Meanwhile, air strikes pounded targets deep inside Yugoslavia today 
in a mission that NATO said has failed to stop Serb forces from 
creating ``ghost towns'' in Kosovo, where nearly one-third of the 
population was reported displaced.

	US Blasts Plan To Try Soldiers  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration strongly condemned  
today Yugoslavia's plans to put three captured U.S. soldiers on 
trial, calling for their immediate release. The Pentagon said the 
men at least deserve human treatment as called for in treaties 
agreed to at the Geneva Convention. As POWs, the Army soldiers 
could be held until the end of hostilities. The Pentagon was trying 
to determine whether the soldiers were captured in Macedonia or had 
blundered into Serb territory while on the run. Yugoslav 
authorities said they were caught in Serbia and resisted arrest.

	U.S. Denies Iraqi Strikes  
</P>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- The United States is denying that it  
conducted air strikes on Baghdad that the Iraqi government said 
destroyed two houses. Military officials say there were no air 
strikes in southern Iraq, although there were two Iraqi violations 
of the ``no-fly'' zone. The official Iraqi News Agency said 
aircraft, including F-14s, F-16s and Tornados, carried out 18 
sorties from Kuwaiti skies and 33 from Saudi skies.

	Jerusalem Pilgrims Mark Good Friday  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Thousands of pilgrims walked through  
Jerusalem's Old City in a Good Friday procession today, retracing 
Jesus' step to his crucifixion. Worshippers sang hymns and read 
prayers in Arabic, Italian, English and several other languages. A 
California group re-enacted Jesus' last walk in full costume, with 
one man dressed as Jesus, crowned with thorns and his face streaked 
with blood.

	Snow Blankets Northern Plains  
</P>
<P>
	BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- Plains residents braced for more stormy  
weather today after more than a foot of snow blanketed parts of the 
region. In the Black Hills in South Dakota, Deadwood got 13 inches 
of snow yesterday and nearby Lead received about a foot. In North 
Dakota, Bismarck and Dickinson both received 9 inches of snow. A 
winter storm watch was still in effect for parts of North Dakota, 
and as much as 6 inches of snow were possible by tonight.

	Ill Grandmother Robbed Buying Pot  
</P>
<P>
	WINNABOW, N.C. (AP) -- A grandmother who says she uses marijuana  
for medicinal purposes was robbed and attacked while on a pot run 
with her 13-year-old grandson in the car. Now police are 
considering filing charges against her from bringing the child 
along. Tinkey Mae Sullivan usually goes alone to buy a 
quarter-ounce to an ounce of pot, which she says eases her 
rheumatoid arthritis and her other ailments. But she took the 
teen-ager along while running some errands. North Carolina has not 
approved use of pot for medical purposes.

	Lyme Disease Vaccine Now Available  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new vaccine for Lyme disease is now  
available and doctors are pushing people to get their shots. 
Doctors say the urgency comes from the fact that it takes a series 
of three shots to build up to full immunity to the disease that is 
caused by pin-sized ticks that live in wooded and grassy areas 
nationwide. Symptoms include fatigue, chills, fevers and joint pain 
that can persist for weeks. Some people develop serious arthritis. 
If untreated, Lyme disease also can severely damage the heart and 
nervous system.

	Murdoch May Buy Out Partner  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Media mogul Rupert Murdoch has agreed to buy  
out a partner to expand his control of regional cable networks and 
his stake in two New York professional sports teams, published 
reports said. Partner John Malone's Liberty Media will sell his 50 
percent interest in Fox/Liberty Networks, the partnership he formed 
with Murdoch in 1995, in exchange for about $1.4 billion in stock 
from Murdoch's News Corporation. The deal gives Murdoch control of 
40 percent of the New York Knicks, the Rangers and Madison Square 
Garden.

<HEADLINE> Markets Closed for Good Friday / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock and most commodity markets are closed  
today in the United States and many other countries in observance 
of Good Friday. U.S. bond markets will close at noon and some 
commodity markets will hold abbreviated morning sessions. 
Government offices and most banks are open. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks closed mostly higher on a late burst of buying Thursday  
as optimism generated by merger announcements overcame worries 
about interest rates and Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 46.35 to 9,832.51 after  
changing direction several times over the course of the day. The 
pre-holiday trading was light, making price swings sharper than 
usual. The Dow ended up 10.27 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also rose. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
rose 7.35 to 1,293.72, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite 
index rose 31.97 to 2,493.37. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors in both the stock and bond markets were trading  
cautiously ahead of the long holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were nervous about the continuing U.S. military presence  
in Yugoslavia and worried that the situation might escalate over 
the weekend. They were also wary about Friday's scheduled release 
of March employment data, especially because the stock market would 
be closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you can make much of this afternoon's  
recovery,'' said Ricky Harrington, technical analyst at 
Interstate/Johnson Lane in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's just a little more caution in the air, and people are  
going into the long weekend trying to not have a great deal of 
exposure either on the up or down side. When the Dow's at 9,800, it 
doesn't take much of a movement in a few Dow stocks to put the 
market up 20 or 30 points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, corporate mergers helped lift the market.  
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! announced a $5.7 billion planned purchase of  
Broadcast.com, sending Yahoo! shares up 11 3/8 to 179 3/4, and 
Broadcast.com up 11 13/16 to 130. 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, BP Amoco announced plans to buy Atlantic Richfield  
for $26.6 billion, a deal that would create the world's 
second-largest oil company. Atlantic Richfield shares fell 11/16 to 
72 7/16, and BP's shares fell 5 3/16 to 95 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	And CBS said it would pay $2.5 billion for King World  
Productions, the largest TV-syndication company. CBS shares fell 
11/16 to 40 1/8, but King World's rose 5/8 to 31 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger talk produced an opening rally, but that soon  
evaporated when the National Association of Purchasing Management 
reported its monthly index of business activity rose to 54.3 
percent last month, an increase of 1.9 percentage points from its 
February level. 
</P>
<P>
	In another sign of economic vigor, the Commerce Department  
reported construction spending jumped a much-stronger-than-expected 
2.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The department also reported personal income increased a  
seasonally adjusted 0.5 percent in February after a 0.6 percent 
gain in January. Consumer spending, meanwhile, jumped 0.7 percent 
after a 0.4 percent rise the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
	The news sent bond prices lower as traders feared the strong  
economy would reignite inflation and lead to higher interest rates. 
The yield on the 30-year Treasury rose to 5.67 percent from 5.62 
late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks followed bonds' lead until late afternoon.  
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues narrowly led advancers on the New York Stock  
Exchange, and consolidated volume was moderate at 848.68 million 
shares, down sharply from Wednesday's pace of 922.16 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 1.40 to 604.99, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.00 to 711.30. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.11 to 398.74. 
</P>
<P>
	In overseas stock markets, the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo surged  
3.10 percent, as domestic and foreign investors scooped up shares 
on the first day of Japan's new fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	European stock markets rose on widespread expectations that the  
European Central Bank will lower its main refinancing rate when its 
governing council meets April 8, traders said. The DAX index in 
Frankfurt climbed 1.01 percent, the FT-SE 100 in London advanced 
0.55 percent, and the CAC in Paris added 0.76 percent.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Jobless Rate Record 6 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Wan Pui-ying wants to know how to bleach toilet  
stains, iron silk shirts and clean up dog poop -- and the government 
of Hong Kong is helping teach her. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with 30 other middle aged women, Wan is taking  
government-funded classes at a local YWCA on how to be a maid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think being a maid is inferior,'' says Wan, a 55-year  
old former jewelry saleswoman. ``Every job deserves respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With unemployment at a record 6 percent and the number of  
vacancies shrinking, the Hong Kong government is trying to upgrade 
the skills of displaced workers competing with others half their 
age. 
</P>
<P>
	The jobless figure is low by world standards. But in Hong Kong --  
where the high-octane, entrepreneurial spirit feeding the city's 
dynamism is bred to the bone -- 206,000 people out of work is 
alarming. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong once saw its financial markets awash with money and  
banks teeming with clients. Stockbrokers, lawyers, flashy 
restaurateurs and discreet powerbrokers commingled amid what seemed 
like a constant boom. 
</P>
<P>
	The bust came with Asia's economic crisis, which threw Hong Kong  
into recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Wan says she was happy peddling watches and necklaces from store  
to store in the busy shopping district in Kowloon, across the 
harbor from Hong Kong Island. But when her employer buckled under 
the recession, Wan found herself out of work and with grim 
prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't speak English,'' Wan said in Cantonese. ``I have no  
office skills. How can I compete with younger misses?'' 
</P>
<P>
	To try to set things right, the government is spending $64  
million this year to fund more than 150 retraining centers all over 
the territory offering classes in computers, typing, English, and 
household chores. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to play a significant role, to release productivity  
and keep Hong Kong ticking,'' said Matthew Cheung, newly-appointed 
commissioner of labor. 
</P>
<P>
	But critics say the government is missing an important point.  
While the government's listing of job vacancies is plentiful -- 
about 130,000 -- most of them are in finance, real estate, 
restaurants, and business services. The training being offered 
won't land anybody one of those positions. 
</P>
<P>
	S.S. Kwong, executive director of the government's Employees  
Retraining Board, says the problem of job mismatch ``happens 
everywhere in the world.'' Critics say the jobs many retrained 
workers will get won't provide a decent living. 
</P>
<P>
	Many unemployed are training to be security guards and office  
clerks, but employers are looking for financial consultants, 
managers, or engineers. In the end, many will have to move down the 
societal ladder instead of up, said So Yuk-yan of the international 
welfare agency Oxfam Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government refuses to accept the fact that the jobs in the  
market are not enough to provide a satisfactory standard of living 
for many low-skilled workers,'' said So, who researches poverty and 
unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	So predicts things will get worse before they get better. She  
sits in a 17-member coalition of welfare agencies, labor activists, 
and trade unions who oppose recent proposals to cut the already 
meager welfare benefits for the unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
	Social welfare director Andrew Leung defends the cutbacks,  
saying no one capable of work should be on permanently on the dole. 
Welfare applications could swell without serious reforms, and the 
government faces a $1.67 billion welfare bill this year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hong Kong's success is its work ethic and we must encourage  
the unemployed to re-enter the job market,'' says Leung. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts suggest joblessness could hit 7 percent by midyear. The  
government has announced major infrastructure projects in the next 
two years -- including a high-tech industrial park -- to create more 
than 120,000 new jobs. Hong Kong is also in talks with Disney about 
building a theme park here. 
</P>
<P>
	But all the details have yet to be finalized, and any new jobs  
won't be created instantly. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, experts say the recession will linger.  
</P>
<P>
	``The worst may be over, but the economy hasn't bottomed out  
yet,'' said Guonan Ma, an economist at the U.S. investment bank 
Salomon Smith Barney.

<HEADLINE>  Stewart Leaves as Missouri Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- Norm Stewart recently said he wanted to  
coach another half-dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he ended a 32-year run at Missouri that produced 634  
victories when he announced his retirement Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	There was speculation that he was pushed out the door by new  
athletic director Mike Alden, who's been at the school only eight 
months, but Stewart said it was his call. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the inspiration came during a game at Kansas in January  
and a familiar chant from Jayhawks fans, ``Sit down, Norm!'' took 
on an entirely different meaning. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know what I said to myself that day? `I think I will,' ''  
Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
	From then on, although he never let on to players or  
administration, Stewart said there was no turning back. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't always make all the right decisions, and you can't  
coach a perfect game,'' Stewart said. ``So you make the decision 
and that's it. I got to make mine. I wish more people in this 
profession got to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart will serve the last four years of his contract as a  
special assistant to the school's chancellor. If there are any hard 
feelings, it was tough to tell as Stewart and Alden shared the 
podium at a center-court news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was in such a light-hearted mood that when he received a  
standing ovation from several hundred fans and players -- past and 
present -- in attendance, he asked if it had been timed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've decided not to coach at Missouri, in basketball or in any  
other sport,'' Stewart said. ``I came to Missouri a young man and 
I'm leaving a young man. Everybody has been really nice and good to 
work with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alden said he was shocked when the coach brought up retirement  
for the first time on March 15, three days after Missouri was 
eliminated by New Mexico in the first round of the NCAA tournament, 
in what he thought would be a typical end-of-season review. He said 
Stewart reiterated his desire to step down the following day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked him, are you sure?'' Alden said. ``He said he had  
decided what he wanted to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players weren't notified until Wednesday, more than two weeks  
after the meeting. They, too, were shocked. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was getting ready for class and my mom called me and she was  
like `Tell me the scoop, tell me the scoop,''' sophomore forward 
Johnnie Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Presumably, Stewart had earned the right to orchestrate his  
departure. He leaves with an impressive resume, at least from a 
numbers standpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	-- He's the third-winningest active coach with 731 victories,  
trailing only James Phelan of Mount St. Mary's (800) and Bobby 
Knight of Indiana (742), and he's seventh on the career list. 
</P>
<P>
	-- He averaged 19 victories a season at Missouri, and as player,  
assistant coach and head coach was involved in more than half 
(1,127) of the 2,151 games ever played at the school. 
</P>
<P>
	-- He bounced back from colon cancer in 1989 and NCAA probation  
in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	-- He produced an undefeated conference champion in 1993-94, a  
team that included zero future NBA stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart also leaves the program in good shape, with three  
starters back and two others with significant experience. That's a 
huge difference from his arrival in 1967, when Missouri totaled six 
victories in 49 games the previous two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I got here there wasn't much springboard,'' Stewart said.  
``There wasn't any pool, there wasn't any water. If you jumped in, 
you had problems. There's a better springboard now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, Missouri hasn't had much success in the  
postseason with a succession of first-round upsets to lightly 
regarded opponents that began in the late 1980s. Missouri missed 
the NCAAs for three years beginning in 1995-96, going a combined 
51-47, before ending that drought this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's Missouri teams twice made it to the final eight, in  
1976 and 1994, but never to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement also came amid reports of a falling-out between  
Stewart and Alden, who wasn't happy with Stewart's lack of response 
last week when junior Albert White announced he wanted to jump to 
the NBA, and of repeated problems with players. Nine players have 
transferred in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight of Stewart's current players attended the news conference,  
and the group did not include White or freshman point guard Keyon 
Dooling, who quarreled with Stewart during a game at Colorado in 
January. Stewart said the reason for the no-shows was he told them 
to attend class. 
</P>
<P>
	Dooling downplayed talk that he and fellow freshman guard  
Clarence Gilbert, a former high school teammate in Fort Lauderdale, 
Fla., might have transferred if Stewart stayed. Gilbert was another 
news conference no-show. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't nothing like that,'' Dooling said. ``From what I  
know, Coach made his decision a long time ago. It really had 
nothing to do with us. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was somewhat of a roller coaster, but it's all good. I mean  
it. I respect him a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alden said he has no short list of candidates in mind to succeed  
Stewart. Possible candidates include Duke assistant Quin Snyder, 
Bob Bender of Washington and longtime Missouri assistant Kim 
Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I would be interested,'' Anderson said. ``As time goes  
on, we'll see what happens.''

<HEADLINE> Compromise Answer on Index Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the long-running debate over the virtues of  
actively managed stock mutual funds or passive index funds, the 
choice is usually portrayed as an either-or decision. But for some 
investors, a better answer might be ``both.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So, anyway, suggests Mark Riepe, head of the investment research  
center at the brokerage firm Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., which has just 
completed a study on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	Riepe advocates a strategy he calls ``core and explore,'' which  
mixes index funds with actively managed funds in an effort to give 
a portfolio a chance to outperform the market while keeping down 
the risk that it might lag substantially behind. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a compromise approach, which may not appeal to people who  
care about coming down on the right side of every argument. But on 
the plus side, it bears more than a passing resemblance to the 
strategy being used by some very successful and practical-minded 
fund managers themselves these days. 
</P>
<P>
	In Riepe's view, fund investors should start with an  
asset-allocation plan, parceling out their money among five types 
of investments: Big stocks, small stocks, international stocks, 
long-term bonds and short-term money market securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Next, you look at the money you have allocated to each category,  
and decide which funds to use. In the big-stock arena, for 
instance, you might turn first to an index fund modeled on Standard 
&AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, which is dominated by blue chips. 
</P>
<P>
	In Riepe's plan, the index fund becomes your core holding in  
that category. Then, if you wish, Riepe goes on to say, ``more 
specialized, actively managed funds are layered on to 'explore' the 
potential of outperforming the overall market.'' The same approach 
can be taken with small stocks and international stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	To test how this system might work in the real world, Riepe and  
his staff checked out how thousands of portfolios -- some using 
core-and-explore, some using ``explore,'' or managed funds, only -- 
would have fared over various three-year spans in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	The results: In the 1995-97 time period, for instance,  
core-and-explore, or C&AMP;E, portfolios got better results on balance 
than either explore-only or core-only portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports Riepe, ``The C&AMP;E portfolios remained less volatile than  
their all-explore counterparts 57 percent of the time. Their higher 
returns, therefore did not come at the price of increased risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of his other conclusions: ``An anchor of core (or index)  
funds can provide an effective counterbalance to more specialized, 
actively managed funds, some of which will underperform and some of 
which will outperform the benchmarks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, ``emphasizing actively managed explore funds  
in the small-cap and international asset classes tended to increase 
a portfolio's potential to beat the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What is an individual investor with a modest-sized nest egg in  
funds to make of all this? The most important message may be not to 
get too doctrinaire about any aspect of fund investing, but to keep 
a balanced view as you put together a portfolio of a few funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Index funds in the big-stock sector of the market have  
consistently achieved better results than most managed funds in 
recent years. But other types of index funds have not outshone 
their managed competitors so decisively. In either case, it's 
impossible to know for certain whether these patterns will hold in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
	More often than not, the choice of an investment must depend on  
your own situation and temperament. Riepe notes that some investors 
may be completely content with an all-core fund portfolio, aiming 
simply to capture a return equal to a market index's while 
minimizing the costs of research and trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Conversely, he says, a preference for ``explore'' funds might  
make sense for ``investors who seek the chance of outperforming the 
market, who favor a certain manager's abilities, or who have a 
strong personal conviction about market trends or a particular 
fund's objectives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If you aren't sure which side you favor, Riepe's study supports  
the idea that you can put one foot in either camp and still give 
yourself a decent chance of success.

<HEADLINE> A Look at Tennis Superstitions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C. (AP) -- Don't step on the court lines.  
Use the same shower every day, even if you have to wait for it. And 
sit on the same side of the umpire as when you won your last match 
-- even if you have to run to the chair. 
</P>
<P>
	Those rituals may seem farfetched, but for some of the top  
players on the Women's Tennis Association tour, they're important. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're winning, you have to use the same shower, same  
chair, same side of the umpire,'' said Rennae Stubbs, who is 
playing doubles this week at the Family Circle Cup. ``If you do 
something different, you freak out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every single player does it.''  
</P>
<P>
	The No. 1 player in the world admits to one little superstition:  
She tries not to step on the lines on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was glad to read that I'm not the only one who does this --  
that I'm not abnormal,'' top-seeded Martina Hingis said of rival 
Monica Seles' practice of avoiding the lines. 
</P>
<P>
	But the superstitions don't stop at walking, sitting and  
showering. They extend to a player's most important piece of 
equipment -- the racket. 
</P>
<P>
	Some players have sent their coaches out in the middle of a  
match to have a racket restrung, said Gunnar Schmid, who strings 
rackets for a living. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmid expects to string about 300 rackets by the end of the  
nine days of Family Circle matches. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're very picky when it comes to tension in the rackets,  
how many knots in the string -- everyone likes something different 
and each is very particular,'' Schmid said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's champion, Amanda Coetzer, doesn't have any rituals  
or tennis superstitions, but she understands why players do. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to maintain a very uncertain lifestyle,'' Coetzer  
said. ``Maybe the superstitions help players have something that 
makes them feel in control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coetzer does have one superstition, but it's not related to  
tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pick up pennies wherever I go because I believe they give me  
luck,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She could have used a pocketful of pennies Thursday shen she  
became the Family Circle Cup's second defending champion to lose 
before the quarterfinals.

<HEADLINE> George Foreman Subpoenaed To Testify </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) -- Former heavyweight champion George  
Foreman has been subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury 
examining whether sanctioning organizations sold rankings and 
arranged fights in return for kickbacks, a newspaper reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	One area being investigated is whether the International Boxing  
Federation sold rankings and demanded money from promoters and 
fighters, The Record said, quoting sources described as only close 
to the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman's attorney Larry Wechsler was quoted as saying that  
federal prosecutors believe Foreman is a victim of the alleged 
scheme, not a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	``My understanding is that George is just one small piece of  
this rather broad-ranging investigation,'' Wechsler said in a 
telephone interview from his office in Washington, D.C. ``The 
government views him as a witness and a victim, and I assume they 
view other boxers in the same way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He told the newspaper he did not know whether anyone had  
extorted money from Foreman to set up a fight or improve his 
ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess the government believes that there must have been  
money extorted from him or people he was involved with,'' Wechsler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman had been scheduled to appear before the panel on  
Wednesday, but probably will testify this month, Wechsler said. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor overseeing the investigation, Assistant U.S.  
Attorney Jose Sierra of the Organized Crime Strike Force in Newark, 
declined to comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The more than year-long probe by the U.S. attorney's office in  
Newark focuses on the IBF and has so far led to subpoenas demanding 
financial records from promoters, a source familiar with the 
investigation has told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The payments were made by fighter managers, sometimes disguised  
as consulting fees, to promoters and sanctioning groups, according 
to unidentified sources cited by The Star-Ledger of Newark, which 
disclosed the investigation last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The IBF, based in East Orange, also came under scrutiny last  
month from law enforcement agencies in New York following the 
controversial draw in the March 13 heavyweight championship bout 
between Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis. Of the three judges, 
only the IBF-picked judge had Holyfield winning the fight many 
believed Lewis dominated. 
</P>
<P>
	The IBF and two other sanctioning groups -- the WBA and the WBC --  
by their rules and rankings, play a large role in determining whom 
a boxer fights. Boxers who defy the groups risk losing the chance 
to be declared a champion and earn large purses. 
</P>
<P>
	``How these different boxers are rated and whether they get to  
championship fights can be worth millions of dollars,'' said IBF 
attorney Walter R. Stone. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal grand jurors have subpoenaed all IBF records since 1982  
on rankings and contracts for fights, as well as checks, invoices, 
expense forms, and telephone records, said Stone. 
</P>
<P>
	IBF president Robert Lee has denied the allegations.  
</P>
<P>
	Lee's attorney, Gerald Krovatin, said he saw no reason for  
concern. 
</P>
<P>
	``For 15 years, people have been making allegations against Bob  
Lee that have proven false and hollow and gone absolutely 
nowhere,'' Krovatin said. ``I have no reason to believe that this 
investigation will be any different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foreman, who lives in Houston, is not concerned about the grand  
jury investigation, Wechsler said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know that anyone wants to come up from Texas to New  
Jersey to testify,'' the attorney said, ``but he's not concerned 
other than it being an inconvenience.''

<HEADLINE> Bomber May Have Targeted Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A man who told a judge he is guilty of trying  
to send a bomb to a federal office in Las Vegas may also have tried 
to send one to President Clinton, law enforcement sources say. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Darwin Alexander tried to plead guilty to federal  
explosives charges in Las Vegas on Friday, but a magistrate judge 
refused to accept the plea. A prosecutor said Alexander is a 
self-described admirer of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh and 
serial mail bomber Theodore Kaczynski. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander is due back in court in Las Vegas on April 9.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, federal investigators are examining charred remains  
of a mail bomb found at a Washington post office for evidence it 
may have been sent by Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said initial examination of the device showed similarities to a 
bomb that exploded at a Dallas post office and to unexploded 
devices found in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources also said investigators, including the Secret Service,  
were looking into whether Alexander intended the similar device to 
be delivered to Clinton. A law enforcement source would not say why 
authorities think the president may have been targeted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I plead no contest, ... guilty,'' Alexander told Magistrate  
Judge Robert Johnston in his first court appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston, however, refused to accept the plea and appointed a  
public defender for Alexander. He ordered Alexander held without 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
	During the hearing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas O'Connell  
linked the three bombs. He said Alexander told Las Vegas police he 
had mailed two devices and attempted to mail a third. O'Connell 
said one detonated in a Dallas postal facility and another likely 
detonated in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	No injuries were reported in connection with any of the devices.  
</P>
<P>
	O'Connell said Alexander also told police he had ``an admiration  
for Theodore Kaczynski and Timothy McVeigh'' and would do the same 
thing again if released. The prosecutor said police found canisters 
of gunpowder and pipe, ``enough to construct eight or so devices,'' 
in Alexander's room. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander also faces Nevada state charges in connection with  
explosive devices found in his Las Vegas motel room. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said federal investigators are comparing remnants of  
the Washington device with unexploded bombs found in Las Vegas and 
components of the pipe bomb that exploded and ignited a small fire 
Sunday inside the Dallas Bulk Mail Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're ... looking at components that have been taken to the  
(Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) lab, and getting together 
with the postal lab,'' ATF special agent Brad Earman said in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The Secret Service, which investigates threats against the  
president, is involved because of the possibility the Washington 
bomb was addressed to the White House, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Secret Service referred questions about Alexander to the  
U.S. attorney's office in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	ATF agents helped collect the debris from the Washington bomb  
Thursday night -- nearly a week after the device apparently started 
a smoky fire inside a truck trailer at the post office loading 
dock. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, post office employees and local Washington  
firefighters thought ``something combustible, or careless smoking, 
or something else innocuous'' ignited the March 26 fire, said 
postal inspector Douglas Bem. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three containers of mail were charred severely,'' and left  
behind at the loading dock when firefighters left, Bem said. The 
containers sat undisturbed until Thursday, when investigators in 
the Alexander case asked about the possibility ``of another device 
that might be headed this way,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Local postal officials then noticed the routine internal report  
of the loading dock fire, Bem said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bomb investigators who then headed to the loading dock  
determined almost immediately that the damage was not from an 
ordinary fire, one source said.

<HEADLINE> Umpires To Honor Chylak With Patch </HEADLINE>

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball has decided to go ahead with putting a  
patch on uniforms this year -- and not those ad patches, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball will honor the memory of former AL umpire Nestor  
Chylak, who will be inducted into the Hall of Fame on July 25, with 
a patch on the uniform of AL umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	Chylak, an AL umpire from 1954-78, was voted into the Hall last  
month by the Veterans' Committee. He died in 1982. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Newspaper Apologizes for Photo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Arizona Republic apologized Friday in print  
to the family of a slain teen-age girl for using her image in the 
background of an April Fools' Day parody photo. 
</P>
<P>
	The photograph, published Thursday in the newspaper's weekly  
entertainment section, is of Julie Sund on ice skates at Yosemite 
National Park, with an image of Chelsea Clinton superimposed in the 
foreground. 
</P>
<P>
	Julie, 15, her mother and a friend disappeared near the park  
this winter and were found dead about a month later. The photo, 
taken the weekend before the three disappeared, was developed and 
given to news organizatons by investigators who found a roll of 
film near the sightseers' charred rental car. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republic said in the apology printed on page A2 that the  
photograph was chosen because it portrayed ice skaters, and their 
identities had not been researched. 
</P>
<P>
	``The use of the photograph was inappropriate,'' the newspaper  
said. ``The Arizona Republic extends its sincere apologies to the 
Sund family and to all of our readers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Julie's aunt, Vickie Caton of Phoenix, spotted the photo in the  
paper Thursday morning and began sobbing, said her husband, Ron. 
</P>
<P>
	Executive Editor Pam Johnson said Publisher John Oppedahl and  
other newspaper officials had called the Sund family to apologize 
personally. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no purpose to using this other than to illustrate  
the idea of ice skating. It's a very regretful situation,'' she 
said. ``We just hope the family can put this aside. They've got 
enough to deal with.''

<HEADLINE> Markets Closed for Good Friday / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock and most commodity markets are closed  
today in the United States and many other countries in observance 
of Good Friday. U.S. bond markets will close at noon and some 
commodity markets will hold abbreviated morning sessions. 
Government offices and most banks are open. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks closed mostly higher on a late burst of buying Thursday  
as optimism generated by merger announcements overcame worries 
about interest rates and Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 46.35 to 9,832.51 after  
changing direction several times over the course of the day. The 
pre-holiday trading was light, making price swings sharper than 
usual. The Dow ended up 10.27 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also rose. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
rose 7.35 to 1,293.72, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite 
index rose 31.97 to 2,493.37. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors in both the stock and bond markets were trading  
cautiously ahead of the long holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were nervous about the continuing U.S. military presence  
in Yugoslavia and worried that the situation might escalate over 
the weekend. They were also wary about Friday's scheduled release 
of March employment data, especially because the stock market would 
be closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you can make much of this afternoon's  
recovery,'' said Ricky Harrington, technical analyst at 
Interstate/Johnson Lane in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's just a little more caution in the air, and people are  
going into the long weekend trying to not have a great deal of 
exposure either on the up or down side. When the Dow's at 9,800, it 
doesn't take much of a movement in a few Dow stocks to put the 
market up 20 or 30 points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, corporate mergers helped lift the market.  
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! announced a $5.7 billion planned purchase of  
Broadcast.com, sending Yahoo! shares up 11 3/8 to 179 3/4, and 
Broadcast.com up 11 13/16 to 130. 
</P>
<P>
	As expected, BP Amoco announced plans to buy Atlantic Richfield  
for $26.6 billion, a deal that would create the world's 
second-largest oil company. Atlantic Richfield shares fell 11/16 to 
72 7/16, and BP's shares fell 5 3/16 to 95 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	And CBS said it would pay $2.5 billion for King World  
Productions, the largest TV-syndication company. CBS shares fell 
11/16 to 40 1/8, but King World's rose 5/8 to 31 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger talk produced an opening rally, but that soon  
evaporated when the National Association of Purchasing Management 
reported its monthly index of business activity rose to 54.3 
percent last month, an increase of 1.9 percentage points from its 
February level. 
</P>
<P>
	In another sign of economic vigor, the Commerce Department  
reported construction spending jumped a much-stronger-than-expected 
2.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The department also reported personal income increased a  
seasonally adjusted 0.5 percent in February after a 0.6 percent 
gain in January. Consumer spending, meanwhile, jumped 0.7 percent 
after a 0.4 percent rise the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
	The news sent bond prices lower as traders feared the strong  
economy would reignite inflation and lead to higher interest rates. 
The yield on the 30-year Treasury rose to 5.67 percent from 5.62 
late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks followed bonds' lead until late afternoon.  
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues narrowly led advancers on the New York Stock  
Exchange, and consolidated volume was moderate at 848.68 million 
shares, down sharply from Wednesday's pace of 922.16 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 1.40 to 604.99, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.00 to 711.30. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.11 to 398.74. 
</P>
<P>
	In overseas stock markets, the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo surged  
3.10 percent, as domestic and foreign investors scooped up shares 
on the first day of Japan's new fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	European stock markets rose on widespread expectations that the  
European Central Bank will lower its main refinancing rate when its 
governing council meets April 8, traders said. The DAX index in 
Frankfurt climbed 1.01 percent, the FT-SE 100 in London advanced 
0.55 percent, and the CAC in Paris added 0.76 percent.

	ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- After embarrassing flip-flops, Jim Harrick

	Harrick held a news conference today at Georgia to explain his

	It was the second time in less than four years, a coach  
embarrassed Georgia by accepting a job, then changing his mind. 
Only this time, Harrick did another flip-flop. 
</P>
<P>
	During an extraordinary 30-hour period, Harrick was introduced  
as Georgia's basketball coach, decided to remain at Rhode Island 
because he didn't want to leave two sons, then went squirming back 
to the Bulldogs. 
</P>
<P>
	The upshot, when all was said and done Thursday, then said and  
done again: Harrick is still the Georgia coach. But it was hardly 
the ideal way to begin rebuilding a program that slumped the last 
two years under Ron Jirsa. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly believe some temporary concerns have been  
raised,'' university president Michael Adams said at a hastily 
arranged news conference. ``How long-lasting that will be remains 
to be seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Harrick was introduced as the new Georgia coach  
after spending the last two years at Rhode Island, where he led the 
Rams to consecutive NCAA tournaments. Harrick called his decision a 
``no-brainer'' and spoke optimistically of building a top program 
in the Southeastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	But Adams, a close friend of Harrick's since both worked at  
Pepperdine in the 1980s, noticed later Wednesday that the coach 
seemed troubled. By Thursday morning, Adams' fears were confirmed 
when Harrick said he had a change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
	In the afternoon, after flying back to Providence and consulting  
with his family, Harrick changed his mind again, saying he wanted 
to join the Bulldogs after all. Then it was up to Georgia officials 
to decide if they wanted Harrick back. 
</P>
<P>
	After discussing the situation for an hour by telephone, Adams  
and athletic director Vince Dooley decided to stick with their 
original choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very emotional decision that involved his family,''  
Dooley said. ``If it was any other reason, to be very frank, I 
would not understand it and I would have moved in another direction 
in a hurry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes you get in a no-win situation,'' Adams said. ``I  
believe his commitment to Georgia is real. I believe he will 
rebuild Georgia basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick, who was scheduled to meet with his Rhode Island players  
and hold a news conference to announce his return, instead, he 
released a statement though Georgia expressing regret for his 
indecision. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick flew back to Athens today to begin recruiting -- a  
condition of the Bulldogs taking him back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited and ready to go to work. It's full speed ahead.  
This is a great, great opportunity,'' Harrick said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In December 1995, Glen Mason agreed to leave Kansas to become  
the Georgia football coach. He reconsidered a week later and 
returned to the Jayhawks on Christmas Day, prompting Dooley to hire 
his second choice 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Donnan has led the Bulldogs to consecutive top-15 seasons,  
while Mason left Kansas in 1996 after a 4-7 finish. 
</P>
<P>
	``My mind was already turning on where to go next,'' Dooley  
said. ``I have experience in things like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amazingly, the series of events occurred on April Fool's Day.  
</P>
<P>
	``My late grandmother was married to my grandfather on April  
Fool's Day,'' Adams said, managing a smile. ``They lived together 
for 61 years and she used to say that was the strangest thing that 
ever happened on April Fool's. I wish she were here, because I 
topped her today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Bestwick, associate athletic director, said he contacted  
another candidate, thought to be Appalachian State's Buzz Peterson. 
Bestwick stressed that no one else was offered the job while 
Harrick flip-flopped. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick was admittedly concerned about the state's anti-nepotism  
law, which prevented him from bringing along his son, Jim Jr., an 
assistant on the Rhode Island staff. But the younger Harrick 
supported his father's decision to come to Georgia all along. 
</P>
<P>
	At the news conference today, Harrick said that his sons were  
waiting for him at the airport in Rhode Island Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I got off the plane they were waiting for me,'' Harrick  
said. ``They said `Georgia's the place for you. Get on a plane and 
go back.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he might change his mind again, Harrick replied, ``It's  
done. There is no more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick, 60, guided UCLA to the 1995 national championship, but  
was fired the following year for his involvement with an illegal 
recruiting dinner. After sitting out a season, he moved to Rhode 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrick has a record of 403-182 in 19 years as coach at  
Pepperdine, UCLA and Rhode Island. His teams qualified for the NCAA 
tournament 14 times, including a current streak of 10 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams said there was no dispute over Harrick's contract, which  
will pay him $550,000 annually, plus $100,000 per year if he 
completes the four-year deal. The coach made about $350,000 last 
season at Rhode Island.

<HEADLINE> China Premier's Visit Still On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite China's call for an immediate halt to  
NATO airstrikes in Yugoslavia, a top Chinese embassy official says 
Premier Zhu Rongji will go ahead next week with a planned White 
House visit. 
</P>
<P>
	In the face of growing U.S.-Chinese tensions over human rights,  
alleged Chinese nuclear spying and U.S. missile defense 
initiatives, Zhu is still hoping to close a deal with the Clinton 
administration to allow Beijing to join the World Trade 
Organization as well, Liu Xiaoming said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that the climate and atmosphere right now is not that  
good, but I think it is all the more important, all the more 
necessary for the leadership to meet,'' said Liu, deputy chief of 
mission at the embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov canceled a visit to the  
White House at the last minute last week as NATO airstrikes got 
under way March 24. Primakov visited Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic this week in an attempt to negotiate a halt to NATO's air 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Liu said Zhu, who has acknowledged this might be a difficult  
visit, is ready to face the good and the bad of the U.S.-Chinese 
relationship. Liu said the Chinese are used to ``storms'' between 
Washington and Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	The premier will make clear to Clinton that China strongly  
opposes U.S. plans to condemn Beijing's human rights record at the 
annual U.N. Human Rights Commission meetings under way in Geneva, 
Liu said. The U.S. resolution, which hasn't been introduced yet, 
will protest recent long prison sentences for members of a banned 
democracy party. 
</P>
<P>
	On trade, Liu said it was uncertain whether U.S. and Chinese  
trade officials, who have been negotiating furiously during the 
past few weeks in Washington and Beijing, will agree on terms for 
China to join the WTO after 13 years of trying. Gaps still remain, 
he acknowledged, in how much China is willing to lower trade 
barriers and tariffs on imported goods. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu's nine-day U.S. tour, which will take him to five cities  
outside Washington, is his first as prime minister. He will see 
President Clinton at the White House on April 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu will arrive in Los Angeles April 6 before heading to  
Washington. He also will visit Denver, Chicago, New York and Boston 
and may observe financial markets, possibly the New York Stock 
Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade.

<HEADLINE> Mystery Surrounds Louis Farrakhan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Is Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of  
Islam, ``recuperating nicely'' from prostate cancer, as Jesse 
Jackson put it? Is he alert and looking forward to going home from 
Howard University Hospital? Or is he, as a Chicago associate says, 
seriously ill? 
</P>
<P>
	A tightlipped hospital staff, conflicting medical reports and  
the Nation of Islam's customary secrecy on its internal affairs are 
combining to raise more questions than to provide answers about the 
health of the 65-year-old Farrakhan, who is recovering from surgery 
he underwent on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan, who has won both worldwide praise and scorn during  
his 20 controversial years at the helm of the Nation of Islam, was 
flown from his Illinois home to the hospital here Tuesday night for 
the emergency surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan, organizer of the nation's largest black gathering in  
history, the Million Man March on Washington in 1995, remained in 
the hospital on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But little beyond that is certain.  
</P>
<P>
	Other than confirming Farrakhan is a patient, the hospital won't  
release information on his condition. And security is so tight on 
his hospital floor that even doctors who aren't working on his case 
are being asked to stay away, said a hospital source. 
</P>
<P>
	The day after the surgery, the Nation of Islam released a  
statement that Farrakhan was stable, resting and that his prognosis 
was excellent. Civil rights leader Jackson issued his own statement 
saying he visited with Farrakhan who was ``recuperating nicely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a report published in The Washington Post on Friday quoted a  
hospital source as saying Farrakhan was more seriously ill than 
Nation of Islam officials were letting on. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard F. Muhammad, Farrakhan's son-in-law and chief of staff,  
called the Post report totally inaccurate and said Farrakhan is 
alert and looked forward to leaving the hospital shortly. 
</P>
<P>
	``His spirits are good. He would like to see visitors but the  
doctors have recommended against that for now,'' Muhammad said. 
``He is very stable and his condition has only improved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The conflicting reports have some Nation of Islam members and  
supporters deeply concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 black ministers in Chicago, Farrakhan's home city,  
are organizing a multi-church prayer service on Easter. A Nation of 
Islam source in Chicago said he heard that prayer services were 
being scheduled in at least seven other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are concerned for him because the situation is serious,''  
said a Chicago source, requesting anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Muslim leader is beloved by many in the black community as  
an uncompromising voice in the fight for black empowerment. At the 
same time, Farrakhan has also drawn the contempt of many for 
statements against whites, Jews and gays. 
</P>
<P>
	Farrakhan's fiery rhetoric has singed not only his opponents but  
also some who have attempted to move closer to him politically. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Kweisi Mfume, then chairman of the Congressional Black  
Caucus, announced the group had formed a ``sacred covenant'' with 
Farrakhan and civil rights groups to develop strategies to combat 
inner-city crime and violence. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mfume was forced to back away when some caucus members said  
they weren't apprised of any arrangement with the Nation of Islam 
and disapproved of some of Farrakhan's language. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe Minister Farrakhan is perhaps the most authentic  
voice for the black disaffected in America,'' said Arthur Magida, 
author of Prophet of Rage, a Farrakhan biography published in 1996. 
``But what detracts from his legacy is his tendency to portray 
blacks as victims of themselves, of whites and of Jewish America.''

<HEADLINE> Police Seek MSU Riot Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Authorities seeking suspects from a  
weekend riot at Michigan State University have confiscated film 
from a developer and subpoenaed news organizations for photos and 
videotape. 
</P>
<P>
	The seizures by East Lansing police took place Monday and  
Wednesday from a film counter at the Meijer department store. It 
came after employees spotted eight rolls of riot footage and 
notified detectives, who presented a search warrant to obtain the 
film. 
</P>
<P>
	Five of the rolls were taken by a freelance photographer who  
covered the riot for The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	About 5,000 people rioted on the Michigan State campus after the  
school lost its Final Four college basketball game to Duke on 
Saturday. Rioters set cars aflame, broke windows and squared off 
with police. Police have made 27 arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	Meijer spokesman John Zimmerman said store employees acted  
responsibly in alerting police to the riot images. He said it was 
store policy to alert police whenever film processors notice a 
potential crime being committed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a well-publicized act of violence,'' Zimmerman said  
</P>
<P>
	Photo processors in Michigan are not required by law to notify  
police that they have such film, said Robert Ianni, criminal 
division chief in the state attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Probably the theory is once you've given up possession of it,  
you have no expectation of privacy because you've given the film to 
a third party,'' Ianni said. ``If you want privacy, develop it 
yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Stuart Dunnings III said his office also issued  
subpoenas Wednesday to 19 news organizations seeking all their 
videotape and film of the riot. He declined to identify them. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Crosby, executive editor of the Lansing State Journal,  
said the newspaper sent police copies of photos it had published. 
But he said the newspaper is not turning over any other photos 
except one of a man believed to have assaulted a State Journal 
employee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need our independence and integrity to do our job,'' Crosby  
said. ``We don't want to be an arm of the police.'' 
</P>
<P>
	WILX-TV news director Kevin Ragan said he turned over only  
material that his station had broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see the need for our pictures to be part of that  
investigation,'' Ragan said. But he added, ``There are some basic 
First Amendment rights and freedom of the press rights we need to 
protect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police on Thursday also began using a Web site,  
www.ci.east-lansing.mi.us, to display pictures of riot suspects. 
Some shots displayed there have been given to detectives 
voluntarily, Lansing Police Lt. Tom Johnstone said.

<HEADLINE> Deadly Hurricane Season Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical storms and hurricanes killed  
thousands last year, and a top forecaster says the 1999 Atlantic 
hurricane season could be just as deadly. 
</P>
<P>
	``The odds strongly favor us entering a new era for storms,''  
William Gray, a Colorado State University weather forecaster, said 
Thursday at the National Hurricane Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray predicted the Atlantic hurricane season this year could  
match the 14 tropical storms and 10 hurricanes that killed at least 
10,000 people last year, mostly by Hurricane Mitch in Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyclical changes making Atlantic waters warmer and saltier are  
behind the upswing in storm activity, Gray said. The same 
conditions have not been seen since the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 season will have 14 named storms and nine hurricanes,  
four of them major, Gray predicted. ``That's a very active 
season,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida could experience severe damage sometime in the near  
future because of the upswing in the number of storms and because 
more people are living in storm-prone areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to be seeing a $50 billion-, $70 billion-, $100  
billion-damage storm,'' Gray said. ``Florida is a sitting duck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over the last 30 years, an average of about 10 tropical storms  
have occurred annually, and five or six have reached hurricane 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane season begins June 1 and lasts through Nov. 30.  
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jeb Bush said at the conference that he would work to  
improve hurricane evacuation routes and maintain tougher building 
codes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a responsibility to make sure people can escape when  
they are asked to do so,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tropical storm and hurricane names selected for 1999 for the  
Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico and Carribean are Arlene, Bret, Cindy, 
Dennis, Emily, Floyd, Gert, Harvey, Irene, Jose, Katrina, Lenny, 
Maria, Nate, Ophelia, Philippe, Rita, Stan, Tammy, Vince and Wilma.

<HEADLINE> Doctor Charged in Drug Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORAL SPRINGS, Fla. (AP) -- A doctor was charged with illegally  
distributing prescription drugs that were used in the overdose 
deaths of up to 20 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Barbara Mazzella, 61, was held Friday on federal charges of  
illegal drug sales, conspiracy to sell drugs and scheming to 
defraud Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``The charges are serious but they're not proven,'' said Ms.  
Mazzella's attorney, Jeffrey Harris. ``She denies breaking the law 
and she's a physician of good standing in the community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an arrest affidavit, investigators said three of Ms.  
Mazzella's patients have been arrested for selling prescribed drugs 
on the black market. One reseller was prescribed 5,422 doses of 
pain killers and was caught in 1998 after selling pills to an 
informant, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	An undercover agent who accompanied a patient to Ms. Mazzella's  
office noted that the patient received four prescriptions from the 
doctor on every visit, the affidavit said. Each time, the patient 
paid $100 for a visit that consisted only of a blood-pressure 
examination, the affidavit said.

<HEADLINE> Mixup Costs Record at Swim Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Matthew Dunn should have swum third and Ray  
Hass fourth in Australia's 800-meter freestyle relay at the world 
short-course swimming championships. 
</P>
<P>
	But the order was reversed, and the difference was a lost chance  
at $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	For not following the order listed on the entry card,  
Australia's relay quartet was disqualified today in the 
preliminaries for the event. 
</P>
<P>
	The team in the heats came within two seconds of breaking its  
own world record, and for the final, the team planned to substitute 
-- legally -- three world champions, giving them a strong chance at a 
short-course world record. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'd have broken the record by a considerable amount,''  
Australian coach Don Talbot said. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury dismissed an appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	For the first time at these championships, FINA, swimming's  
world governing body, is offering $15,000 for each world record 
broken. 
</P>
<P>
	Record breakers so far include Australian Ian Thorpe in the  
200-meter freestyle; the Swedish women's 800-meter freestyle relay 
team; Slovakia's Martina Moravcova, who beat American Jenny 
Thompson's world mark in the 100-meter individual medley; and 
Thompson, who promptly broke it again. 
</P>
<P>
	Talbot said he had submitted the entry card with Dunn third and  
Hass fourth, behind Todd Pearson and Daniel Kowalski. Preparing to 
send the swimmers into action, an Australian staffer sought to 
reach an officials' table to check the card and make sure they were 
following the correct order, Talbot said. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said, officials ``don't let people move around freely''  
in the Hong Kong Coliseum, and the staffer wasn't allowed access to 
the table. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, Talbot said, a meet official who should have ensured in  
advance that swimmers were in the correct order did not do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly there was fault with us,'' Talbot said, ``but I  
think everybody has a right to argue their case. They didn't want 
to hear that there was error on their side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was prepared to point out to the appeals jury that a Canadian  
women's relay quartet swam out of order Thursday without penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury refused to hear explanations, he added.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to rebound from the disappointment. They were set on  
getting a world record, and there's bonus money for that,'' Talbot 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The team that swam in the heats finished in 7 minutes, 4.73  
seconds, close to the world mark of 7:02.74 set by Australia at the 
last short-course championships in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	For the final, the Australians had planned to have Thorpe, Grant  
Hackett and Michael Klim join Dunn for a run at the record. 
</P>
<P>
	Thorpe is the world long-course champion at 400 meters, and  
holds the short-course world records at 200 and 400. Last week, 
Hackett broke the world 200-meter long-course record. He also is 
the world long-course champion at 1,500 meters and the short-course 
world record holder in that event. Klim is the long-course world 
champion in the 200 freestyle and 100 butterfly.

<HEADLINE> Fed. Considered Reversing Rate Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve policy-makers in February  
considered -- but rejected -- the idea of taking back at least one of 
the quarter-point interest-rate cuts they engineered last fall, 
according to minutes of their meeting that were released today. 
</P>
<P>
	In three steps from late September to mid-November, the Fed  
reduced the benchmark rate on overnight loans between banks from 
5.5 percent to 4.75 percent to prevent the world market turmoil 
that followed the collapse of the Russian ruble from harming the 
U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	In a meeting on Feb. 3, members of the Federal Open Market  
Committee noted that ``the market unsettlement that had in large 
measure prompted the committee's easing actions during the fall had 
now lessened appreciably.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In the view of some,'' the minutes continued, ``those actions  
might need to be reversed, at least in part, to restore what they 
regarded as a policy stance that seemed most likely to prove 
consistent with desirable economic trends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the minutes revealed, the panel voted unanimously  
against changing the benchmark rate, which is known as the federal 
funds rate. The panel met again Tuesday and decided again to leave 
the rate unchanged. Minutes of that meeting are due out in mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
	At the February session, one member -- the minutes did not reveal  
who -- argued the Fed should adopt a policy directive declaring 
higher rates were more likely than lower rates in the future. But, 
in the end, all accepted a directive giving equal weight to the 
possibility of a rate cut or rate increase. 
</P>
<P>
	``The members agreed on the need to continue to monitor the  
economy with care for signs either of a potential upturn in 
inflation or greater softness in the expansion than they were 
currently forecasting and to be prepared to respond promptly in 
either direction,'' the minutes said. 
</P>
<P>
	In their discussion of the economy, the panel found ``few signs  
that the economic expansion had moderated to a more sustainable 
rate, but most continued to anticipate substantial slowing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the reasons were ``the waning effects of the earlier  
increases in stock market wealth on consumer spending and some 
slowing in the extraordinary growth in business expenditures for 
equipment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On another subject, the panel agreed that they favored extending  
the legal requirement that they be required to report to Congress 
twice a year. The requirement is scheduled to lapse at the end of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The members agreed that the semiannual reports and associated  
congressional hearings had been quite useful and should be 
continued,'' the minutes said. ``They had given the committee an 
effective means to explain its policies and communicate its views 
on a variety of issues and had enhanced its accountability to the 
public and the Congress.''

<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A man has been arrested and charged with  
originating the e-mail virus known as Melissa, which swamped 
computers around the world, spreading like a malicious chain 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
	David L. Smith, who was arrested Thursday night, named the virus  
after a topless dancer from Florida, where he used to live, the New 
Jersey attorney general's office said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 30, of Aberdeen was arrested at his brother's house in  
nearby Eatontown, said Rita Malley, a spokeswoman for Attorney 
General Peter Verniero. Smith created the virus from his apartment, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	He faces several charges, including interruption of public  
communications, conspiracy to commit the offense, attempt to commit 
the offense, and third-degree theft of computer service. All 
together, the charges carry a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison 
and a $480,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he is tried and successfully convicted, he will do hard  
time.'' Verniero said at an afternoon news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Verniero said Smith was a network programmer for a company that  
did subcontracting for AT&AMP;T Corp. The company's name was not 
immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was tracked down with the help of America Online  
technicians, and a computer task force composed of federal and 
state agents, Malley said. Authorities would not elaborate on the 
methods used to trace the virus, saying the investigation was 
ongoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Melissa appeared last Friday and spread rapidly around the world  
by Monday, swamping the e-mail systems of thousands of computers -- 
including those at government agencies. The virus caused infected 
computers to fire off dozens of messages to friends and colleagues, 
temporarily clogging e-mail systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, experts had said there were clues that  
Melissa's author had distributed the virus using an account stolen 
from America Online 15 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Several antivirus software makers, including McAfee, Symantec,  
Trend Micro and Sophos, posted patches on their Web sites that 
detect and reject the Melissa virus. 
</P>
<P>
	It came in the form of an e-mail, usually containing the subject  
line ``Important Message,'' and appeared to be from a friend or 
colleague. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of the e-mail message said, ``Here is that document you  
asked for ... don't show it to anyone else'' with a winking smiley 
face formed by the punctuation marks ;-). 
</P>
<P>
	Attached to the message was a document file. If the user opened  
that file, the virus dug into the user's address book and sent 
infected documents to the first 50 addresses. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was released on $100,000 bail and was scheduled to appear  
in state Superior Court in Monmouth County Monday for arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
	Several computer experts earlier this week said they had found  
clues linking the virus to a writer who uses the computer handle 
``VicodinES.'' Malley said Smith was ``definitely not'' the person 
who used that handle, but also said investigators believe he took 
two viruses, one of which came from VicodinES, and combined them 
with another virus to create Melissa. 
</P>
<P>
	VicodinES, which also happens to be the name of narcotic pain  
killer, is well know to a group of virus writers who gather online 
on what's known as The Virus Exchange Underground. 
</P>
<P>
	No one answered the door at Smith's second-floor apartment in  
the Ken Gardens complex in Aberdeen today. The blinds were drawn to 
his windows and on a sliding glass door to a small balcony.

<HEADLINE> Stiltsville Snubbed as Landmark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BISCAYNE NATIONAL PARK, Fla. (AP) -- It looks like it could be  
splitsville for Stiltsville. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Register of Historic Places has decided that the  
seven stilt homes that have become a veritable landmark don't 
qualify as an official landmark -- so they'll probably be 
demolished. 
</P>
<P>
	``The history of the area is certainly interesting,'' said  
Marilyn Harper, a Register historian. ``But the houses that are 
there now are all post-1960.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buildings less than 50 years old must show ``exceptional  
importance'' to earn historic status, according to Register 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	The owners had hoped to stave off demolition by winning historic  
status. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a serious setback,'' said Gail Baldwin, a Miami architect  
and co-owner of one of the homes. ``We're disappointed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stiltsville homes rise from the shallow waters dividing  
Biscayne Bay from the reefed fringe of the Atlantic Ocean a few 
miles southeast of Miami. They are the descendants of a community 
that began in the early 1930s when structures were built on sunken 
barges. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years other homes were added, mostly on pilings driven  
into the bottom. At its height, there were about 25 dwellings, used 
for weekend retreats and parties but seldom as full-time homes. 
</P>
<P>
	For many years, they had a colorful reputation as hangouts for  
gamblers, boozers and flashy women. They have appeared repeatedly 
in novels and on television. Inhabitants bragged of being able to 
catch fish right off their porches or watch boats go by, all within 
sight of the Miami skyline. 
</P>
<P>
	The state allowed the bay bottom under existing houses to be  
leased but prohibited new construction after the Legislature passed 
the Biscayne Bay Aquatic Preserve Act in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	The last seven leases expire on June 30 and won't be renewed on  
orders of the Florida Cabinet, which controls bay bottoms in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Park Service has controlled the waters around  
Stiltsville since the area was annexed into Biscayne National Park 
in 1980. Superintendent Dick Frost is determined to remove the 
structures, and he is supported by environmental groups such as the 
National Audubon Society. 
</P>
<P>
	``The presence of privately owned houses is generally considered  
contrary to the purposes of designated national parks,'' Frost 
wrote in a recent letter. ``There is nothing ... that supports 
retaining any of the buildings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who tried to get the homes listed as historic was  
Miami novelist Les Standiford, who had a Stiltsville home become a 
kidnapper's hideaway in his novel ``Done Deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No one who chances upon the phenomenon of Stiltsville for the  
first time will ever forget the sight of homes that hover above the 
waters, miles from any shore, like structures from a dream,'' he 
wrote in a letter to the Register.

<HEADLINE> Chisox' Konerko Learns Hard Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Paul Konerko wanted to be one of those  
players who wears the same uniform his entire career. 
</P>
<P>
	He was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers, came up through their  
farm system, made his big league debut at Dodger Stadium and hoped 
he'd retire one day still wearing the Dodger blue. But he learned 
the hard way last season that loyalty in baseball has gone the way 
of baggy uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a business,'' the first baseman-designated hitter for  
the Chicago White Sox said. ``I've always given people the benefit 
of the doubt and trusted them right off the bat, and I was always 
pretty fortunate because I had good people around me. But it kind 
of all came at once last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Konerko, 23, was Los Angeles' first-round pick -- 13th overall --  
in the 1994 free-agent draft. In 1997, ``Baseball America'' and 
``Baseball Weekly'' named him minor league player of the year after 
he batted .323 with 37 homers and 127 RBIs in Triple-A. He was the 
Dodgers' minor league MVP a second year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	He was called up for six games at the end of the 1997 season,  
making his first start in the season finale. When opening day 
rolled around last year, Konerko was the Dodgers' starting first 
baseman. 
</P>
<P>
	Duplicating his success in the minors right away wasn't easy. In  
49 games, he hit .215 with four homers and 16 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just all stemmed from the fact there wasn't a place for me  
and they didn't want me to go back to Triple-A because they knew I 
didn't have anything to prove there,'' he said. ``I was on the 
team, but I really didn't have a role.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he was willing to do whatever the Dodgers wanted to stay  
with the organization. They sent him down to Triple-A for a spell, 
and that was fine. He sat on the bench, and that was fine, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a company guy -- I wanted to play for that company,'' he  
said. ``Some people are like, `Oh, it's not a perfect situation 
here, I want to be traded. I'll play for any team.' It wasn't like 
that. I was willing to have a bad situation for year or whatever to 
get eventually to what I play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was willing to take it for the team, be there and play or do  
whatever was asked of me. And then one day you turn around and it's 
like, `Thanks for coming. See you later.''' 
</P>
<P>
	On July 4, the Dodgers shipped him and left-handed pitcher  
Dennys Reyes to the Cincinnati Reds for reliever Jeff Shaw. The 
trade was completed during a game with the San Francisco Giants, 
and Konerko left the Dodgers dugout before the bottom of the first 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Lasorda, the Dodgers' interim general manager then, said he  
didn't want to trade Konerko, but the Reds wouldn't give up Shaw 
without him. There was just one problem. The Reds didn't have a 
place for him, either. They had a first baseman, Sean Casey, and he 
didn't play another position. 
</P>
<P>
	So Konerko turned into a utility player, spending time at first,  
third and left field. Although he was still struggling at the 
plate, he was stunned when the Reds sent him down to Triple-A just 
25 days after the trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``There wasn't one time last year that I didn't try as hard as I  
could or give 100 percent,'' he said. ``I didn't play well at times 
and, at times, I don't think I was given a chance to play well or 
treated the right way. It just didn't work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the season, he was traded to the White Sox for  
outfielder Mike Cameron. Chicago needed someone to split the duties 
at first and DH with Frank Thomas, and Greg Norton was moving to 
third to replace Robin Ventura, who signed with the New York Mets 
as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the best news Konerko had all year.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was thrilled,'' he said. ``After seeing what the situation  
was here and that I'd have a role on the team, I couldn't ask for 
anything better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	These days, Konerko doesn't want to wear blue the rest of his  
career. Black and white will suit him just fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's a statistic that the average player changes  
teams four times. So last year, maybe I'm just all done with it,'' 
he said. ``Maybe I'll play with these guys for the next however 
long. I just look at it that way.''
