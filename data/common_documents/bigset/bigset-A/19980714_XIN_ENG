<HEADLINE> New York Traffic Deaths Falling to Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The number of pedestrians and
bicyclists killed by drivers in New York City declined toward a record
low, according to a report of the New York Times Monday.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary police records show that from January 1 to June 3
of this year, 71 pedestrians and bicyclists were killed by motor
vehicles -- a 36 percent drop from the same period in 1997, in which
111 were killed.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the city authorities have vigorously pushed traffic
enforcement as a means to make New York City safer. They instructed
the police to erect pedestrian barricades, hand out more speeding
tickets, discourage jaywalking and install new signs informing drivers
that the speed limit is 30 miles per hour in most places.
</P>
<P>
Now, it appears that those efforts are beginning to pay off.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that the number of pedestrians and bicyclists
killed in the city this year would be about 168 -- which would be
significantly lower than the previous low of 245 in 1996, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, traffic deaths for pedestrians and bicyclists stood at
365. Then came a drop that has since leveled off at around 250 deaths.
</P>
<P>
The city's efforts in cracking down traffic deaths are in varied
forms. In March, the city unveiled a much-publicized "zero tolerance" day,
in which police officers used hand-held radar guns and unmarked
cruisers to catch speeding drivers, and installed more than 1,100 new
signs informing drivers of the speed limit.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hopes to Continue Strong Relations with Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States hopes to
continue its strong relations with Japan despite resignation of
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto following a defeat of his party
in the Japanese Upper House election, the White House said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Mike McCurry said President Bill Clinton was
expected to take a call from Hashimoto late on Monday evening in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
He said U.S. officials would work with Japanese officials to
schedule a visit by the new prime minister. Hashimoto was
scheduled to pay a state visit to the United States later this
month, but the trip was canceled as a result of Hashimoto's
resignation.
</P>
<P>
McCurry also said Washington hoped a newly formed Japanese
government would take quick action on economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
"It is very important to the United States that new
government, whatever its composition, move quickly to implement
concrete fiscal and banking measures to achieve strong domestic
demand-led growth in Japan and to restore confidence in Japan's
financial system," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We think they will see it in their own self-interest to
pursue economic reform quickly," he added.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Russia Confirm to Execute Missile Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot and Russian presidents
have confirmed the two sides' readiness to go ahead with the
implementation of a deal for the delivery of Russian-made S-300
surface-to-air missile system to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The confirmation was made in a meeting between Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides and his Russian counterpart Boris
Yeltsin in the Kremlin Monday, Cyprus News Agency (CNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Clerides is currently in Moscow to be a guest of honor at the
opening of the World Youth Games to be held in the Russian
capital, at the invitation of Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
CNA quoted Yeltsin's aide Sergei Prikhodko as saying after the
meeting that "it was confirmed what had been repeatedly agreed -
the two parties' readiness to honor the earlier assumed
obligations" relating to the delivery of the missile system to the
Greek Cypriots-controlled southern part.
</P>
<P>
Prikhodko noted that military and technical cooperation
between Russia and Cyprus "is an integral part of our inter-state
relations."
</P>
<P>
However, he did not say when the delivery will take place. A
week ago, Russian officials said that Moscow had decided to delay
delivery of the missiles until late this fall.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus signed the missile contract with Russian manufacturers
in January 1997. The 425-million-U.S.-dollar deal includes
launchers and missiles, together with long-range guidance radars,
which could be deployed on the divided island late this summer.
</P>
<P>
The deal has angered Turkish Cypriots, who resided in the
northern part of the divided island and their ally Turkey, who
said their security would be seriously endangered by the missiles
that have a range of 150 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has vowed to take all necessary measures to prevent the
deployment of the missiles on the island, which threatens an armed
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Russia has supported Clerides' proposal for demilitarization of
the island as precondition for cancellation of the missile deal.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the meeting between the two presidents, Prikhodko
said there was identity of views on the prospects and ways to
solve the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries expressed their desire to strengthen
even further economic relations.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the
aftermath of a abortive coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with
Greece.

<HEADLINE> Israel Denies Training Turkish Pilots to Destroy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli government on Monday
strongly denied reports that Israel has trained Turkish fighter
pilots to destroy anti-aircraft missiles to be deployed by Cyprus,
saying their relations do not target at any third party.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry spokesman dismissed as "baseless" the
reports on a Turkish newspaper, which also said that a military
base has been set up in southern Turkey for Israel to use.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted the spokesman as saying that Israel and
Turkey have stated more than once that the relations between the
two countries are "not aimed at another party."
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post reported Monday that in a sign of strong
military relations between Israel and Turkey, Turkey has decided
to increase the number of military attaches in Israel from one to
three.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also quoted a senior Israeli airforce commander
as confirming that a squadron of Turkish fighter jets were
training in Negev of southern Israel three weeks ago. But the
commander declined to say what type of training they were doing.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been criticized by Arab and Muslim countries, as
well as its Mediterranean rival Greece, for its military
cooperation with Israel, which includes joint military exercises
and training of Turkish pilots in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post quoted the Jane's Defense Weekly as
reporting that Turkey is continuing with contingency plans for
taking military action against the Greek-Cypriots should they
deploy the missiles.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus signed the missile contract with Russian manufacturers
in January 1997. The 425-million-U.S.-dollar deal includes
launchers and missiles, together with long-range guidance radars,
which could be deployed on the divided island late this summer.

<HEADLINE> Austria Reveals EU Presidency Work Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Enlargement negotiation and
Kosovo crisis are high on the work program Austria revealed on
Monday for its rotating presidency of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schussel detailed the work
program before fellow foreign ministers from EU member states at
Monday's general affairs council.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that nothing will serve the objective of political
stability and economic progress in Europe better than the
integration of European Union's neighbors into the union and that
hardly any other country has as great an interest in the success
of enlargement as Austria that shares borders with four candidate
countries for accession.
</P>
<P>
Schussel said that the six-month Austrian presidency wants to
open substantive negotiations with candidates countries.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has invited Poland, Hungary, the Czech
Republic, Romania, Slovenia and Cyprus to start accession talks.
</P>
<P>
Austria also promised to continue stressing employment that was
the highlight during the Luxembourg presidency in the latter half
of last year as well as the transition to the realization of the
single currency, euro.
</P>
<P>
As for external relations, the Austrian foreign minister rated
Kosovo high on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
He said that the EU foreign ministers had started to
concentrate on the status of the Yugoslav province and that what
EU aims for is a status the Kosovars will agree to so as to remain
within the borders of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"We have to be careful in that any changes of geographical
borders in that area might have spillover or domino effects," he
told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
When asked how to work out the difference between the culture
autonomy offered by Belgrade and the outright independence strived
for by the Liberation Army of Kosovo, Schussel said that it will
be a difficult task in that different people have differing
understandings about the term autonomy.
</P>
<P>
But the Austrian presidency made it clear that the first
priority in Kosovo is to stop all acts of violence as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
The EU will maintain its pressure on Belgrade for it to fulfil
its international obligations but will also apply pressure on the
inhabitants of Kosovo as "a growing radicalisation can be
detected".
</P>
<P>
The Austrian presidency will also continue the union's role in
peace-making in the Middle East, Schussel added.

<HEADLINE> Iran Expresses Regrets Over Escalation of War in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran's special representative on
Afghanistan Alaeddin Boroujerdi Monday voiced Tehran's regret over
the escalation of war in Afghanistan after the Taliban militia
captured a key city from the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Denouncing the Taliban offensive as "fratricide," Boroujerdi
said experience has shown that the ups and downs in military
ground have no impact on the major principle to put an end to the
Afghan crisis through political means.
</P>
<P>
Winning victory through wars is an injustice against the Afghan
people who are suffering from the atrocities of war, the official
news agency IRNA quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim military group Taliban forces took over Maimana,
capital city of the northwestern Faryab province, after heavy
fighting with opposition forces loyal to the Uzbek General Abdul
Rashid Dostam.
</P>
<P>
Faryab was a major stronghold of Dostam, who joined the
Northern Alliance after the Taliban militia ousted the government
of President Burhanuddin Rabbani in September, 1996.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the importance of the peacemaking efforts of the
United Nations, the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the
regional states, expressing the hope that political negotiations
would replace military operations in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
During a visit of Pakistani special envoy Iftakhar Murshid to
Tehran last week, Iran and Pakistan, two influential neighbors of
Afghanistan, agreed to continue joint efforts to push forward the
Afghan deadlocked peace process.

<HEADLINE> Business Confidence in UK at Five-year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Business confidence in Britain is
at its lowest for at least five years, according to a survey
published on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The survey of more than 1,400 finance and managing directors
was carried out between June 10 and June 26, shortly after the
Bank of England's monetary policy committee raised interest rates
to 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Philip Mellor, senior analyst from Dun &AMP; Bradstreet, an
information service which conducted the survey, said: "These
results partially reflect the first flush of pessimism in the wake
of the news about increased inflation and interest rates. They
show a significant downturn in economic confidence."
</P>
<P>
"As more and more firms expect further increases in interest
rates, so business gloom has spread from exporters into the
domestic economy," he added.
</P>
<P>
A separate report, published by Oxford Economic Forecasting
(OEF), said that Britain faced the potential problem of
stagflation with a combination of rising wage inflation and a
beleaguered manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
It said that there was every chance that the Bank of England
would raise interest rates further, increasing the risk of a hard
landing for the economy.
</P>
<P>
The outlook for the economy depends in part on the Bank's
response to any further weakening in sterling. It would be wrong
to defend a pound under pressure from weakening economic growth by
raising rates, OEF argued.

<HEADLINE> Saudi King Welcomes Palestine's New U.N. Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz
on Monday welcomed the decision by the United Nations General
Assembly to upgrade the status of the Palestinian observer
delegation.
</P>
<P>
King Fahd made his statement during the weekly session of the
Saudi cabinet held under his chairmanship, according to the Saudi
Press Agency (SPA).
</P>
<P>
SPA said that the king regarded the U.N. decision as "a
positive step on the right path towards full membership for the
Palestinian state" in the international organization.
</P>
<P>
Brushing aside objections by the United States and Israel, the
U.N. General Assembly voted overwhelmingly on July 7 to upgrade
the status of the Palestinian observer mission in the U.N. to
nonvoting seat.
</P>
<P>
This gives Palestine the right to participate in the general
debate, a three-week-long litany of political speeches at the
opening of the General Assembly in the fall of the year.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution also gives Palestine the right to speak on
any subject, not just the Middle East to which it had been
restricted under the old formula.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian delegation will also be able to co-sponsor
resolutions on Palestinian and Middle East issues.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Complains About Illegal Employment of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The rampancy of illegal hiring of
Filipinos in Jordan have induced these people to low salary,
abuse and inability of returning to the motherland, the Philippine
Embassy here said.
</P>
<P>
Some 7,000 Filipinos are currently working in the kingdom and
only half of them hold valid contracts approved by the Jordanian
Ministry of Interior and authenticated by the Philippine Embassy,
the embassy said in a press release obtained Monday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Filipinos illegally employed in Jordan are
household workers and they are usually paid less than 300
U.S. dollars a month, which the Philippine labor regulations
define as the minimum salary for a household worker, exclusive of
food and accommodation.
</P>
<P>
Besides low payment, in recent years there have been some
reports of sexual, physical and psychological abuses against some
of the three million Filipinos working overseas, especially those
in the Gulf countries, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
The same thing happened to the Filipinos illegally working in
Jordan, although it is not so problematic, it added.
</P>
<P>
Because of their illegal identity, the Filipinos have to bear
anything that the employers exert on them, even physical and
psychological abuses, it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there are now a lot of Filipinos in Jordan unable to
leave the kingdom because they can not afford long-overdue fees.
</P>
<P>
Some employers did not help their Philippine household workers
apply for extension of visas after they finished the
contracts. Any foreigner in Jordan alone can not apply for such an
extension. He will be charged one Jordanian dinar (about 1.4
dollars) for each day he overstays his visas.
</P>
<P>
The embassy admitted in its press release that a five-year
closure of the Philippine Embassy in Jordan from 1993 to 1998
created many problems for the Filipinos working in the kingdom and
resulted in the mushrooming of illegal agencies recruiting workers
directly from the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
According to the labor law enforced in 1996 in the
Philippines, Filipinos can only be recruited through direct
hiring from their motherland and Philippine household workers can
only be employed by the Jordanian Royal family, cabinet
ministers, other high officials in the Jordanian government and
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
However, illegal agencies in Jordan have not respected the
labor law and made Filipinos hired by anyone who wanted and
afforded to do so while not giving valid contracts and not
applying governmental permission for them, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
The embassy hoped the Jordanian government to agree to issue a
special amnesty for workers who were hired illegally and can not
pay the fees for over-staying.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government has placed the total number of guest
workers in the kingdom at over half a million and has long tried
to regulate foreign employment and reduce the number of illegal
aliens.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official Calls for Arab Solidarity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 13 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian Official
Monday called on Arab countries to enhance cooperation and
soldiarity in order to reactivate the stalled peace process in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Farouk Kadoumy, head of the Palestinian Liberation
Organization's Political Department, made the appeal in a news
conference jointly held with Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz.
</P>
<P>
According to the Lebanese National News Agency, Kadoumy said
all Arab negotiations with Israel are connected and therefore
solidarity between Arab countries are needed in order to gain a
stronger bargaining position.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed the necessity of convening an Arab summit to
formulate a new Arab strategy aimed at countering Israel's
intransigency in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
He said that Jerusalem, a holy city both Israel and Palestine
claimed as their capital, is not only for Palestine, but for all
Arabs.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian track in the peace process is currently
stalled as Israel refuses to accept a United States initiative for
an Israeli withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said Israel is attempting to empty all peace accords
signed with Arabs, and at the same time projects itself to the
world as a peace-seeker.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foreign minister called on the U.S. to play a fair
and honest role in the peace talks and pressure Israel to keep its
promises made toward Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Kadoumy came to Lebanon Saturday on a three-day visit after
winding up a trip to Syria.

<HEADLINE> Direct Investment in and by OECD Countries in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) said on Monday that despite the
financial crisis in Asia, the direct investment in and by OECD
countries broke record in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The direct investment by OECD countries attained 355 billion
U.S. dollars, 19 percent more than 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, these countries received 255 billion U.S. dollars
worth of direct investment, 16 percent more than 1996, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Direct investment is considered the best there is by all
governments, because of their stable capitals, jobs created from
them and technological transfers.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain were on top of the 29 OECD
countries in making and receiving direct investments in 1996, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
However, direct investment in and by France dropped by 12
billion U.S. dollars as compared with 1996, with 14.8 billion U.S.
dollars of investment by foreign enterprises in France and 24.9
billion U.S. dollars of investment made by France abroad.

<HEADLINE> Annan Sees Growing need for International </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- There is a growing need for
international arrangements, treaties or institutions to deal with
those "problems without passport", U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive written interview with Xinhua News Agency,
Annan said, "Increasingly, we live in a global village. The Asian
economic crisis, for example, is being felt around the world. And
the world must devise a solution which requires international
mechanisms, such as the International Monetary Fund."
</P>
<P>
"So whether we are talking about financial stability,
depletion of the ozone layer, the fight against AIDS or the
need to control drug trafficking, I see a growing need for
international agreements, treaties or institutions to deal with
these problems without passports," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Annan believed the the United Nations, the world's only universal
organization, would take the lead in the next century to
tackle these problems.
</P>
<P>
"To do so effectively, the United Nations will have to focus
its energies on those areas where it can contribute most," Annan
added.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Population Growth Rate Drops to 1.41 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran's population growth rate has
dropped to 1.41 percent at present from 1.56 percent in 1996,
Deputy Health Minister Ali Akbar Sayari announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to local press on the occasion of World Population
Day which fell last Saturday, Sayari warned that family planning
is still a serious issue in Iran since 1.2 million new-born
children add to the population every year.
</P>
<P>
The evening daily Kayhan quoted him as saying that at present
24 percent of pregnancies are still unwanted in the country. And
because of a lack of education, 50 percent of women receiving
private services and 27 percent of women receiving public services
are using contraceptives in wrong ways.
</P>
<P>
He said that at present 50 percent of married people are using
modern family planning methods while 20 percent of them are using
traditional means.
</P>
<P>
Sayari did not mention the country's population. But earlier
official report put the figure at 60,055,488 in 1996 with 61
percent living in urban areas and 39 percent in rural regions.
</P>
<P>
Iran's population growth rate stood as high as 3.2 percent
during the decade between 1976 and 1986. But after the economic
hardships in the 1990s, more and more Iran people have abandoned
the tradition to have a large family.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- If the rich-poor gap is
going to close, developing countries have to be plugged in to the
global economy and to compete internationally, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive written interview with Xinhua News Agency,
Annan said the foreign assistance has been in the trend of
declining for years, and foreign investment, on the other hand,
has been increasing.
</P>
<P>
Annan said private companies today have not only the capital,
but also the technology and the management skills that developing
countries need.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the primary goal for the United Nations is to assist
developing countries to structure their laws and their economies
in a way to make them more attractive to private investors.
</P>
<P>
Annan stressed that for many countries or regions, particularly
in Africa, establishing political stability is the first
requirement to develop their economies.
</P>
<P>
In this global village, every member benefits when one member
is made stronger and economically more viable and prosperous, the
U.N. chief added.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Denies Reported Israeli Use of Airbase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Ministry here
Monday denied allegations in news reports that a military airbase
being constructed in eastern Turkey has been used by Israeli for
spy purposes.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the ministry called "totally baseless and
intentional" the claims that Israel used the military airbase in
eastern Turkey and conducted espionage activities against
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The news reports first appeared in the Christian Science
Monitor newspaper and later in the Turkish press, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
"Despite all the denials, several circles are still trying to
spread these (claims). It is clear that recent news reports in
this respect which appeared in the media is a continuation of
these allegations," added the statement.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel are developing bilateral ties for "the
benefit of the peoples of the two countries and have no objectives
aimed at a third country," it said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel have signed a series of military and defense
accords under which they share airspace and bases for training
purposes.
</P>
<P>
The rapidly expanding Turkish-Israeli military cooperation has
prompted serious concern among Arab countries, who fear it would
change the region's balance of power.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Calls for Ease of Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot government spokesman
Christos Stylianides Monday called for solution to the Cyprus
problem, saying the demilitarization of the island is the way to
reduce tension on this Eastern Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
He made the call while commenting on a report in Turkish daily
"Hurriyet" Monday that six F-16 Turkish fighters have conducted
exercises at an Israeli training center, designed to destroy the
Russian-made S-300 missile defense system, expected to be deployed
on the island later this year.
</P>
<P>
"Cyprus' demilitarization and the solution of the Cyprus
problem is the only way the tension that Turkey is trying to
create in the region could be tackled," the spokesman said at his
press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Turkish press reports, Stylianides said he
had no information on the issue. Cyprus "has always maintained a
cautious stance toward the military defense agreement between
Israel and Turkey," he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that Israel has reassured the Cypriot
government that its agreement with Turkey does not affect Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the Cypriot government is investigating into
the reports about Turkish military aircraft training exercises in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
But the Israeli Embassy in Cyprus Monday denied the Turkish
press reports that Turkish military planes conducted exercises in
Israel with the purpose to destroy the Russian-made missiles
purchased by Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
In a press release, the Israeli Embassy "categorically denies
these reports" and described them as "unfounded and untrue."
</P>
<P>
"The embassy also denied the reports that an air-base will be
built in eastern Turkey, that will be especially used by Israeli
planes," the press release said.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government ordered the S-300 missiles from Russia
in January 1997 to boost its defense. The deal angered Turkey and
the Turkish Cypriots, who fear that their security will be
seriously endangered by the missiles that have a range of 150
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has vowed to take all necessary measures to prevent the
deployment of the missiles on the island.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz warned last week that his
country would bring missiles to the occupied northern areas if the
Cypriot government goes ahead with the deployment of the missiles.
</P>
<P>
If the missiles are deployed, "tension will increase in Cyprus
and an armed conflict could arise, and we won't be the losers,"
Yilmaz said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since Turkey landed and
took over the northern third of the island in 1974 after a
short-lived Greek Cypriot coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally in 1983 a breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" in the north, recognized
only by Turkey, which maintains 35,000 troops there.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Defends France's 1994 Intervention in Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Monday implicitly defended France's 1994 military intervention in
Rwanda as purely humanitarian instead of an interference into the
internal affairs of that central African state.
</P>
<P>
"Some critics ask about the real aims and situation of the
engagement of our forces outside our national territory. But the
foreign residents evacuated last year from Brazzaville, or the
people of Sarajevo in suffering, know with what kind of courage
and what self-sacrifice our soldiers rescued them," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
He made the declaration during a traditional meeting with
military and civilian officials of the defense ministry on the eve
of the French National Day.
</P>
<P>
But Chirac did not mention the name of Rwanda or the exact
military operation France launched in 1994 in that country.
</P>
<P>
"France does not seek to interfere into the internal affairs of
other countries. She tries to protect the people, to maintain
peace and allow the rules of international laws be respected," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The French National Assembly has been holding hearings over the
past six months on the role France played before and during the
1994 genocide committed by the Hutu majority against Tutsi
minority in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Some critics have accused France of supporting the Hutu
military regime of Rwanda before the genocide took place.

<HEADLINE> House Prices Rise in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 13 (Xinhua) -- House prices in South Africa
increased further in the second quarter of the year, the ABSA
banking group announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
Allied Bank of South Africa (ABSA) said the increase was
caused by market instability, the depreciation of the Rand, and
the subsequent increase in interest rates and bond rates.
</P>
<P>
"Volatile financial markets look certain to force interest
rates and bond rates to remain on high levels for an indefinite
period, negatively affecting the house market in the process,"
ABSA said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The highest house price rise was recorded in the Northern Cape
province (27.7 percent) and the lowest in Gauteng (9.2 percent).

<HEADLINE> Israeli Inner Cabinet Fails to Decide on Pullback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli inner cabinet Monday
failed again to make a decision on the second redeployment of
Israeli troops in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of Israel Radio, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu hold talks with other three inner cabinet members for
about one hour in an effort to reach a consensus over the next
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the three members - Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai, Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon and Trade and
Industry Minister Natan Sharansky - agreed with Netanyahu to
continue talks on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Early on Monday, Netanyahu said that Israel "almost closed the
gaps" with the United States over the long-overdue pullback issue,
which remained a major obstacle to a revival of peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the only thing holding up the progress is
the Palestinian refusal to implement their commitments to fight
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have been stalled for over a
year over the extent of the next Israeli withdrawal in the West
Bank. A U.S. initiative calls on Israel to hand over 13 percent
more of the West Bank in return for the fulfillment of the
Palestinian commitments.
</P>
<P>
The right-wing in the Israeli government opposed to the
proposed scope, saying it would endanger the security interests of
Israel. The hawkish leader Sharon also noted that any redeployment
of more than 9 percent would not be acceptable.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Top Legislator Named As Ruling Party's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's Parliament Speaker James
Wapakhabulo was elected as the National Political Commissar (NPC)
of the ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) Monday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
President Yoweri Museveni, who was elected unopposed as the
chairperson of the NRM Monday morning, proposed to the NRM's
National Executive Committee two candidates for the post.
</P>
<P>
The 113-member committee chose the Speaker after the other
candidate stepped down at the last minute in favor of
Wapakhabulo.
</P>
<P>
In his brief speech as the NPC, Wapakhabulo pledged to make
the permanent secretariat of the Movement an effective and
efficient organ and to provide through political schools
qualified cadres for the Movement branches throughout Uganda.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned the delegates that the people of Uganda will
judge the Movement through its performance in creating jobs,
eliminating poverty, providing health, education and building
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
He promised to carry out frequent inspections to see how well
the Movement performs in these and other important areas to
ensure that the Movement remains relevant and popular.
</P>
<P>
The Speaker's success in handling the controversial
constituent assembly which debated and enacted the 1995
constitution shot him to political stardom. He then was elected
unopposed as MP for eastern Mbale Municipality and subsequently
Speaker.
</P>
<P>
Under the Constitution of Uganda, the Speaker is the third in
the hierarchy after the President and Vice President.
</P>
<P>
The NPC, also deemed as the number three within the Movement,
is often depicted as the most active. He is mainly responsible
for mobilization and other important matters within the ruling
party.
</P>
<P>
The national congress of the NRM has drawn 1,554 delegates
from all over the country and is to end Friday. It is the first
of its kind in Uganda's history and is to be held every five
years.
</P>
<P>
President Museveni has been holding the chair of the Movement
since it took power in 1986. This time the chairperson, vice
chairperson and national political commissar are elected to run a
five-year term.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Finance ministers from the
14-nation Southern African Development Community (SADC) trading
block are to meet United States Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
in the Namibian capital of Windhoek Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Rubin's delegation, which includes a number of senior
executives from private U.S. financial institutions, will be
updated on business opportunities in the region, South African
Press Association reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The SADC ministers would also discuss a regional finance and
investment protocol and some other new projects, a spokesman for
South African Finance Minister Trevor Manuel said Monday.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the SADC financial and investment sector's annual
report would be considered and a committee dealing with insurance
securities and other non-banking authorities is to be established.
</P>
<P>
Rubin's visit to Namibia is the third stop on his five-nation
African tour, which also includes Cote d'Ivoire, South Africa,
Mozambique and Kenya.
</P>
<P>
His aim is to seek closer working relationships with African
countries and to encourage economic reform on the poorest continent,
the U.S. embassy said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin's African tour came months after U.S. President Bill
Clinton's visit, during which Washington's new trade-for-aid
Africa policy was unveiled.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, EU to Resume Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 13 (Xinhua) -- A new round of free trade
negotiations between South Africa and the European Union (EU)
will resume in Pretoria Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The EU is expected to table an improved offer in response to
concessions made by South Africa in last month's Brussels talks.
</P>
<P>
South Africa proposed to increase its offer to cover 85
percent of imports from the EU that would have duty-free access
to the South African market, conditional upon the EU revising its
offer to cover at least 95 percent of products from South Africa,
South African Press Association reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The EU is under pressure to achieve a trade agreement with
South Africa by October this year following EU leaders' pledge to
South African President Nelson Mandela at the EU summit in
Cardiff, Wales last month.
</P>
<P>
The South African negotiating team will be headed by its
ambassador to the EU, Elias Links, and the EU's by Philip Lowe,
its director-general in charge of development.
</P>
<P>
Michael Laidler, EU ambassador to South Africa, said Monday
that both sides had been working at improving the proposed trade
deal.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident the offers have been improved on both sides. The
point is to try and continue to improve them."
</P>
<P>
Laidler could not say whether this week's talks would be
definitive, but stressed there was no standoff in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"We are making steady progress," he said.
</P>
<P>
A South African trade official said Monday that the talks would
cover all outstanding issues of customs cooperation and the rules of
origin of products.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Tries to Strengthen Trade Ties With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Ghanaian President Jerry
Rawlings discussed means of enhancing economic and bilateral
relations with Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We identified some trade and economic areas which we hope
could be enhanced," Rawlings told journalists after meeting
Mugabe for more than three hours.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings said he briefed Mugabe on his recent visit to South
Africa and his discussions on regional trade he held there.
</P>
<P>
He said ideally regional trade should not be dominated by big
powers.
</P>
<P>
"I briefed mugabe about the peace and stability on the
continent, and prevailing situation in west Africa in
particular," said Rawlings.
</P>
<P>
He said the leaders hoped to use the current stalemate in
Guinea Bissau to come up with a negotiated settlement.
</P>
<P>
Should a negotiated settlement fails, the next step would be
to impose economic sanctions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian leader Abdullar Salam Abubakar had began to create a
"healthy" political situation in the west African country, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"It was rather unfortunate that Moshood Abiola died just on
the verge of being released," he said, adding, "I know for a fact
that the late leader Sani Abacha, had indicated during our
private talks that he was going to do it."
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that in time Abubakar would create an
opening for other political parties.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings arrived in Zimbabwe Sunday on a three-day private
visit.

<HEADLINE> G. Bissau Situation in Favor of Govt: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The situation in Guinea Bissau is
tipping the scales in favor of the government, a visiting Guinea
Bissau minister asserted here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Jose da Silva, Guinea Bissau's Minister of State for Rural
Development, Natural Resources and Environment, said after talks
with Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos that the government
troops are advancing toward the rebel forces' base near the
airport.
</P>
<P>
Silva, who arrived here Saturday, conveyed a letter of Guinea
Bissau President Nino Vieira to Santos.
</P>
<P>
On the mediation efforts by Portugal and Angola, Silva said
the Vieira government has agreed to hold talks with the rebels,
but the precondition is that they must first lay down their arms.
</P>
<P>
The visiting minister said that the government has formed a
committee with the Red Cross, Christian associations and other
Non-governmental Organizations to take charge of the humanitarian
aid affairs.
</P>
<P>
Ansumane Mane, former Chief of the General Staff of the armed
forces, who was removed from his post for his involvement in arms
smuggling, launched a mutiny against Vieirane in early June.
</P>
<P>
In the month-long turmoil, many people fled the capital as
refugees.
</P>
<P>
Angolan Foreign Minister Venancio de Moura and his Portuguese
counterpart Jaime Gama went to Bissau, capital of the western
Africa country in late June as mediators between the government
and the rebels, after many state leaders failed in their peace
effort.
</P>
<P>
They have made some gains in their mediation and are now
working hard to make more progress.

<HEADLINE> Child Malnutrition Grows in Sudan City: U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 13 (Xinhua) -- A set of nutritional surveys
recently conducted by the U.N. found that more than half of the
children in war-torn southern Sudan's Bahr el Ghazal province are
malnourished, the Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Around 4,000 of the children are estimated to require
therapeutic feeding, OLS, the coordinator of U.N. efforts to
assist Sudan said in a statement it issued jointly with the U.N.
Children Fund (UNICEF) here.
</P>
<P>
In order to meet the needs of 38,000 children in Bahr el
Ghazal, OLS said it requires four million U.S. Dollars to open
another 19 feeding centers.
</P>
<P>
At present, OLS is feeding almost 14,000 children in 19
feeding centers. Plans are underway to double the figures
following the surveys.
</P>
<P>
The major reason for the high rates of child malnutrition is
lack of food rather than prevalence of disease, said Ted Chaiban,
Deputy Chief of Operations of the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
"During this time of year, the 'hunger gap', rates of child
malnutrition are always high. This year, however, we are seeing a
significant increase over last year's already high figure of 40
percent child malnutrition," he said.
</P>
<P>
Civil war in southern Sudan has entered the 15th year between
the Moslem-led Khartoum government and the rebel Sudan People's
Liberation Army fighting for more autonomy in the animist and
Christian-dominated south.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Oil Output to be in Sharp Rise: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Angola expects to see a sharp rise
of its oil production in the years to come thanks to the newly
found under sea oil fields with rich reserves, an official said
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Albina Assis, Minister of Petroleum, told Angola Information
monthly that because of the new findings in under sea and
deep-sea rich oil fields, Angola is to turn out one million
barrels of oil by 2000 per day and 1.3 million by 2003.
</P>
<P>
She said that nine under water oil fields have been discovered
off the capital Luanda and off Cabinda, with a total reserve of
more than five billion barrels.
</P>
<P>
Many foreign companies have applied to join in the exploration
of the oil fields, she disclosed, noting that Angola has a bright
future in its oil industry.
</P>
<P>
Assis said the development of the oil industry in the country
would be beneficial to the region, as Angola would be able to
supply its neighbors with oil and petroleum products when the
construction of new oil refineries, including one in the coastal
city of Lobito, is completed.
</P>
<P>
Angola would pay more attention to training its own
technicians with the construction of some new refineries, Assis
promised.

<HEADLINE> Somali Capital Cleared of Road blocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Mogadishu sighed with relief
after security campaigns have been launched Monday by organized
armed militiamen on the road between Mogadishu and Afgoie, 30 km
south of the capital, and the main streets linking it.
</P>
<P>
The two main operations which coincided have cleared dozens of
road blocks which made those streets hardly passable for the
public transport buses in the past.
</P>
<P>
More than 17 illegal road blocks were removed from the
Mogadishu-Afgoie road by forces loyal to Hussein Ali Weheliye
Erfo, the chief security person of lower Shabelle Region Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The campaign was prompted by outrageous activities carried out
by freelance militiamen who collected extortion money from the
public transport vehicles going from Mogadishu to Afgoie and the
other way round.
</P>
<P>
Many bus owners had put their vehicles in garages after they
found out that the profit they were making did not correspond to
the extortion money they were asked by the militiamen.
</P>
<P>
The relief has also been observed in the northern part of
Mogadishu after the public transport buses have once again
started operating Monday following a serious protest by the
drivers early Sunday in which the buses had stopped crossing from
the north to the south of the capital.
</P>
<P>
All people went on foot Sunday to cross the former green lines
to conduct their routine businesses since no buses had operated
because of the protest against the road blocks.
</P>
<P>
The security operation in northern Mogadishu has been carried
out by Ali Sheikh Mohamud (Sheikh Ali Dhere), the former chairman
of North Mogadishu's collapsed Islamic courts, and his militiamen
who rounded up more than 11 freelance gunmen.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 illegal road blocks have been erected by outlawed
militiamen in the main streets linking the former north and south
parts of the capital where they forced bus drivers to pay 5,000
Shillings (nearly 65 U.S. Cents), a considerably high extortion
money, for each trip they cross from the North to the South of
the capital city.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Rejects Portugal's Position on G. Bissau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) has rejected the request by Portugal that
it should steer clear of the Guinea Bissau conflict, the official
News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
NAN quoted Lansana Kouyate, Executive Secretary of ECOWAS as
saying at the weekend in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso that
Portugal's request is unacceptable to the regional body.
</P>
<P>
He said though Guinea Bissau is a former Portugal territory,
it is in West Africa and therefore, shares same geographical
experiences, adding that "colonial era is over."
</P>
<P>
"If the former colonial master wants to assist in solving the
problems of its former territory, it must do so in concert with
the regional grouping where the territory is currently located,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, about a week ago, Portugal asked
ECOWAS not to intervene in its former territory's political
issues because it was going to step in together with Angola,
another former Portugal territory in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The president of Guinea Bissau is aware of the existence of
its former colonial master before it requested the ECOWAS
chairman to assist in quelling the conflict in his country,
Kouyate said.
</P>
<P>
Guinea Bissau President Joao Bernado Vieira had requested the
military intervention of the sub-regional peace-keeping force
ECOMOG in his country, following the rebellion led by former Army
Chief of Staff Amsumane Mane, who was sacked by Vieira in June
for neglect of duty.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS countries had met on his request and decided to use
dialog and negotiations, imposition of sanctions and enforcement
of embargo and use of force to resolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Kouyate said ECOWAS has also decided not to answer Portugal
because its request is not reasonable.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus' Missile Plan to Be Responded: Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash said Monday that Turkey will retaliate if the Cypriot
government finally deploys S-300 missiles on the divided island,
according to Turkish Cypriot news agency TAK.
</P>
<P>
"Our position today stands at a point that you will get a
response to whatever you do," said Denktash in a meeting with a
Turkish Foreign Ministry delegation visiting the Turkish
Cypriots-controlled northern part of the Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
Denktash made the statement as Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and his Cypriot counterpart Glafcos Clerides confirmed in Moscow
that they will go ahead with the missile deal.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest agreement between Nicosia and Moscow,
the missiles will be delivered and deployed in Cyprus by the end
of November.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus signed a contract with Russia early last year to buy the
Russian-made S-300 missiles in an effort to boost its defense,
angering Turkish Cypriots and Turkey who said their security is
threatened by the missiles.
</P>
<P>
Ankara has vowed to use all possible means to prevent the
missiles from entering the small island, calling the deployment
"a direct and serious threat" to Turkish Cypriots and Turkey
itself.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish troops
landed and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said last week that his
country would increase its military presence on the island in
response to the missiles' deployment. At present, 35,000-strong
Turkish troops are stationed on the northern side of the island.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been provided political, economic and military
support to Turkish Cypriots and is the sole country to recognize
the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" unilaterally declared by
Turkish Cypriots in 1983.

<HEADLINE> No Sign of Israeli Fulfiling U.S. Plan: PLC Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official said
Monday that he does not see any "promising" sign that Israel
intends to abide by the Oslo accord, or at least the U.S.
initiative.
</P>
<P>
According to the Middle East News Agency (MENA), Ahmed Qureia
(Abu Ala), speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council, said
that there is no sign that the U.S. plan would be implemented by
the end of this month, unless Washington intervenes and uses its
weight to force Israel to respect the Oslo accord.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. plan, already accepted by Palestinians, calls for
Israeli troop pullout from another 13 percent of the West Bank in
the long-overdue second redeployment, which remains a major
obstacle to a revival of the Palestinian-Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. State Department official said last Thursday that
Washington may be obliged to elaborate on the details of its
initiative and pinpoint the party responsible for the current
stalemate by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
According to analysts, the American move may set off an
American-Israeli face-off, particularly in that all concerned
concur that Israel is to blame for over-one-year stalemate in the
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with MENA, the Palestinian speaker said no
serious talks or negotiations are currently under way with the
Israelis and there is also no sign indicating that they could be
resumed shortly.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the call made by U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright to hold direct Palestinian-Israeli talks, he
said it was "discouraging."
</P>
<P>
Albright is pressing the two sides to negotiate directly, and
Israeli media has cited efforts to arrange for Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai to meet chief Palestinian negotiator
Abu Mazen.
</P>
<P>
"What would the Palestinians and Israelis negotiate about?" he
wondered. The Israeli government has for months resisted the
U.S. initiative, which has had Palestinian backing.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the coming steps to break the impasse facing the
peace march, the speaker said that the Palestinians would stick
in full to their stances and never change them.

<HEADLINE> W. Africa Has One Million Refugees: UNHCR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The current number of refugees in
west Africa has increased to about one million from 20,000 in
1989, according to the United Nations High Commission for
Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
The conflicts in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Senegal, Mali and
Mauritania were responsible for the rise in the number of
refugees in the region, UNHCR said in a publication reaching here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to it, the Liberian crisis triggered by the civil
war beginning 1989 produced 472,000 refugees, while 500,000
others were as a result of the Sierra Leonean conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, along with five others -- Angola, Burundi,
Eritrea, Sudan and Somalia -- were the "laboratory" which
produced the refugees in Africa, UNHCR said.
</P>
<P>
The publication said as at January 1998, out of 22.3 million
refugees handled by the U.N. refugee body, 7.2 million were in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
It said that 2.2 million of the refugees from Africa have
recently returned to their places of origin, while 1.5 million
others were displaced.
</P>
<P>
According to the publication, 411,500 refugees were from the
Somali conflicts, 346,000 others were products of the Sudanese
armed struggle, while Eritrea accounted for 321,000 refugees in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR figure also showed that Burundi produced 268,000 of the
refugees, while 100,000 refugees and 75,000 others were milled
from the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda
respectively.

to provide the Special Representative of the Secretary-General
with regular information in particular with a view to
determining when conditions are sufficiently secure to allow
subsequent deployment of military observers beyond the first
phase.
</P>
<P>
UNOMSIL would also help to monitor the disarmament and
demobilization of former combatants concentrated in secure areas
of the country, to assist in monitoring respect for
international humanitarian law and to monitor the voluntary
disarmament and demobilization of members of the Civil Defense Forces.
</P>
<P>
The Council further decided that approximately 40 military
observers would be deployed in the first phase and the
subsequent deployment shall take place as soon as security
conditions permits.
</P>
<P>
The Council said UNOMSIL shall be led by the Special Envoy of
the Secretary-General, who will be designated Special
Representative for Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> 2 Irish Peacekeepers Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Two Irish soldiers of the United
Nations peacekeeping force serving in south Lebanon were wounded
Monday night by Israeli shelling, Lebanon's Voice of the People
radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The two, both from the Irish battalion within the U.N. Interim
Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), were wounded when Israeli artillery
troops shelled the Hataida village in the central sector of the
Israeli occupied south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
A gasoline station owned by a Lebanese was also heavily
damaged in the attack, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
A UNIFIL official told the radio that the two Irish soldiers,
one man and one woman, had been transferred to the hospital in
UNIFIL's headquarters in Naqoura near the Israeli northern border.
</P>
<P>
He added that the force was investigating the incident.
</P>
<P>
The 4,500-member UNIFIL, comprising contingents from nine
countries, was established in 1978 after Israel's first invasion
of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
It was designed to help restore peace and security across the
border between Lebanon and Israel and confirm the Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But Israel has been complaining that the force had been
ineffective in protecting its northern border from Lebanese
guerrillas' attack.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' attack.
</P>
<P>
But its occupation has been facing up a strong Lebanese
resistance movement spearheaded by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah,
or Party of God.

<HEADLINE> Libya to Help Bring Stability to Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Libyan leader Col. Muammar Gaddafi
has promised to help to bring about stability to Sierra Leone, an
official in the west African country said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi gave the assurance to Sierra Leonean President Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah during his recent visit to Libya, said Kabbah's
spokesman in the capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan leader promised to leave no stone unturned in
assisting Sierra Leone, said the spokesman, quoted by a British
Broadcasting Corporation report monitored here.
</P>
<P>
President Kabbah has already returned from a visit to Libya,
the spokesman said, but he did not say when the visit took place.
</P>
<P>
As a direct aid, Gaddafi has given Sierra Leonean people rice
and petroleum products to assist them at the difficult period, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman refused to disclose the quantity of the rice and
petroleum products, but presidential sources said it amounted to
several ship loads.
</P>
<P>
During his recent tour, President Kabbah visited Saudi Arabia
and met with King Fahd Abeul-Aziz and other top Saudi officials,
including the executive officials of the Islamic Development Bank
(ISB).
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the ISB has given clearance to
re-start operations in Sierra Leone after international financial
institutions and banks withdrew from that country following the
military coup in May last year.
</P>
<P>
Before the coup, Saudi Arabia had funded the Freetown
Peninsula Road through the ISB with some 25 million U.S. Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Demobilization for Better Equipment: Museveni </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
said Monday morning that the recent demobilization plan is aimed
at arming the Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF) with better
equipment.
</P>
<P>
The president made the explanation at the opening ceremony of
the national congress of the ruling National Resistance Movement
(NRM) which was held in the International Conference Center here.
</P>
<P>
He said a massive infantry is not good enough for handling
regional matters and therefore the size of the army should be
reduced to save money for the advanced equipment.
</P>
<P>
The armies of nearly all the neighboring countries are better
equipped than that in Uganda, he cautioned.
</P>
<P>
According to a New Vision's Monday report, 330 army veterans
have been listed on the demobilization project.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out in the report that because the UPDF is better
equipped than rebels, the thugs are changing from attacking the
army to attacking soft targets to discredit the government that
is not giving enough protection to its people.
</P>
<P>
The payment for the veterans would be delayed to ensure that
the army is re-equipped first. The security of the country takes
priority over payment of workers, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the reduction of the size of the army, the
government increased the defense spending by 26 percent in the
budget for 1998/1999 to modernize its armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's army falls into four divisions, with a total number
of some 37,000 servicemen.

<HEADLINE> British Army Defuses Huge Car Bomb in N. Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The British army experts defused a
500 lb (225 kg) car bomb outside a court house in the Northern
Irish town of Newry on Monday, police said.
</P>
<P>
An army bomb disposal expert dismantled the device in a
four-hour security operation after a telephoned warning.
</P>
<P>
No group had claimed responsibility so far, but police said
dissident republicans were believed to be behind the car bomb
plot.
</P>
<P>
Police said the device, which contained home-made explosives,
was in the boot of a car parked on a street at the entrance to the
court.
</P>
<P>
It was the second bomb defused in the area since the parade
crisis started eight days ago -- on Sunday a 1,400 lb (645 kg)
device was found and dismantled by police on a builder's trailer
left on a road in nearby County Armagh.
</P>
<P>
The failed attack came during a day of tension in Northern
Ireland as thousands of the pro-British Protestant Orangemen held
parades in towns and villages to mark the high point of a
four-month "marching season".

<HEADLINE> Romania's Small, Medium-Sized Firms in Critical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The small and medium-sized
companies (SMCs) in Romania are in critical condition, most of
them having a small turnover, said the National Union of the
Romanian Employers Monday.
</P>
<P>
An analysis on 300,000 SMCs of the existing 500,000 showed that
over one half of them have a small turnover, under 50 million
lei (about 5,700 U.S. dollars). There are even companies with zero
lei turnover.
</P>
<P>
Half of the the companies with sales figure up to 1 billion lei
(about 110,000 U.S. dollars) had recorded losses or account profit
smaller than 2 percent of their turnover, the analysis also
showed.
</P>
<P>
President of the National Union of the Romanian Employers
Stefan Chelariu said that the SMCs are blocked by causes such as
high-leveled fiscality, prohibitionary interest rates, the reduced
valorization of the financing resources dedicated to the Romanian
entrepreneurs, and high-leveled rents.
</P>
<P>
Among the strategic objectives proposed by the union are the
intrinsic privatization of the SMCs with still state majority
capital by the end of this year, the definition and delimitation
of SMCs of the rest of economic operators and their three-levels'
structuring, the entire cut or 80 percent reduction of reinvested
profit tax.

<HEADLINE> Peres Outlines Factors for Enliving Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres said here Monday that Jordan's King Hussein's efforts, the
U.S. participation and economic prosperity of Palestinians are the
three major factors for reviving the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Peres, who arrived here earlier Monday on a visit, made the
remark after meeting the king and exchanged views with him on the
current stalemate of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The role that was played and is still being played by Hussein
is very important for the establishment of peace in the region,
especially on the Palestinian-Israeli track," said Peres.
</P>
<P>
He asked Hussein to continue efforts to save the long-stalled
peace process, "otherwise it will be big loss for the whole
region."
</P>
<P>
The United States, as another side of the peace force, should
also continue to play its vital role in the Middle East, for its
participation is very important in maintaining peace and security
in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This requires intensifying the U.S. efforts to activate the
peace process, solve outstanding issues and ease tension in the
region," Peres added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Peres called on all the concerned sides to support
the Palestinians in achieving economic prosperity - another
important factor that can help revive the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Peres' visit came in a string of contacts between Jordan's
leadership and the prominent figures of the Israel's opposition
Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
Labor Knesset (parliament) member Yossi Beilin, who under the
government of late Yitzhak Rabin negotiated with the Palestinians
on peace accords, visited Amman late Sunday to pave the way for
Peres' visit.
</P>
<P>
Crown Prince Hassan talked with Beilin for an hour on the
latest developments of the Middle East peace process in light of
the U.S. proposal which calls for Israel to withdraw from 13.1
percent of the West Bank. The Palestinians have accepted the plan
while Israel rejected it.
</P>
<P>
In another development of the Israeli-Jordanian contacts, Labor
Party leader Ehud Barak is also due here Tuesday for talks with
Hussein and the crown prince.
</P>
<P>
These contacts are part of the efforts exerted by the Labor
party as well as by Jordan to push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Moi Favors Peaceful End of Ethio-Eritrean Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President D. arap Moi
Monday pledged to do everything he could for the implementation
of the resolution of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to
peacefully resolve the Ethio-Eritrean border conflict.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin said this to newsmen
in Nairobi while accompanying Prime Minister Meles Zenawi during
his visit to Kenya, the Ethiopian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Deyoum said during the talks, Moi underlined the need for
concerted efforts to peacefully settle the crisis which he said
is detrimental to peace in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Moi affirmed to the Ethiopian delegation his strong support
for the implementation of the resolution of the OAU summit in
Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, Seyoum was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Seyoum said, Moi has underlined the need for the immediate
implementation of the OAU and U.N. resolutions to realize the
peaceful settlement of the border conflict.
</P>
<P>
The elderly statesman in the sub-region said he will continue
his effort to achieve a peaceful settlement of the crisis,
according to the Ethiopian foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
The OAU resolution favors the withdrawal of troops from the
position before conflicts took place in early May.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, informed sources said here that a Tunisian
delegation left here this evening for Asmara to continue its
mediation efforts between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The Tunisian delegation delivered a message of President Ben
Ali to Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles here, expressing his
support for the peaceful settlement of the Ethio-Eritrean border
crisis. The delegation has met and talked with Ethiopian prime
minister Meles.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Helps Albania Collect Lost Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has
recommended that Albania improve its legal system and encourage
voluntary surrender instead of employing cash incentives to
collect weapons taken by civilians in the 1997 financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Some 650,000 weapons, 20,000 tons of explosives and 1.5 billion
bullets were taken away from the country's military depots, said a
report released here Monday by a U.N. team.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Evaluation Mission to Albania, led by U.N.
Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs Jayantha
Dhanapala, visited Albania from June 11-14 at the request of the
Albanian government.
</P>
<P>
The team met with Albanian leaders and representatives of
international bodies, Dhanapala told the press.
</P>
<P>
The report found that those taking weapons away were mostly
investors in a failed financial scheme called the Piramids which
promised huge returns on investment.
</P>
<P>
Many of the 3.3 million inhabitants in the mountainous
Southeast European country sold their properties including
livestock and homes to buy the shares before the scheme was
bankrupt. When their dreams shattered, panic and chaos followed.
</P>
<P>
Since August 1997 the government has retrieved about 10 percent
of the weapons. About 25 percent to 30 percent of the weapons not
returned to the government may have been moved out of the country
in contraband activities.
</P>
<P>
Most of those still holding the arms are using them to trade
for money as a quarter to a third of them are unemployed, the U.N.
mission believed. Use by organized criminals accounted for about
10 percent, Dhanapala said.
</P>
<P>
He said cash incentives or buy-back schemes are not feasible as
the number of weapons in question is so large and if doing so it
would send out the wrong message that unauthorized weapons
possession is a lucrative activity.
</P>
<P>
Dhanapala said the U.N. approach consists of disarmament and
development aimed at providing practical benefits to villages and
communities when the advocacy campaign for voluntary surrender is
practiced in the context of high unemployment in Albania.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Development Program (UNDP) is studying a pilot program
in the heaviest weapons possession district of Gramshi, 200 km
south of the capital of Tirana.
</P>
<P>
With a population of about 50,000, Gramshi is estimated to
account for roughly 8 to 10 percent of the weapons held by
civilians nationwide. The UNDP-assisted program may create 2,000
jobs among other benefits to bring to locals.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has helped many countries in weapons collection
programs but the Albanian case is the first in which civilians are
involved, Dhanapala said, noting that international cooperation is
needed in the operation.

<HEADLINE> Carbon Said to Be Clue to El Nino </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Scientists from Harvard
University said they have found a clue to El Nino's origin by
studying a coral reef near the Galapagos Islands.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest issue of Science, Thomas P. Guilderson
and Daniel P. Schrag of Harvard University came to the conclusion
after examining the coral's carbon content to get a historical
record of subsurface water temperatures in the eastern tropical
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Since 1976, El Nino has become more frequent and more intense,
spawning floods, droughts and other foul weather around the globe.
But the cause of El Nino, a warming in equatorial Pacific surface
waters, has remained a mystery.
</P>
<P>
U.S. scientists said they found carbon 14 levels jumped much
more abruptly than normal in 1976, suggesting that warmer
subsurface waters may have flowed upward, causing surface
temperatures to increase.
</P>
<P>
However, the scientists said why this occurred, and whether it
has any connection to global warming remains unknown.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department said
Monday that it had no relations for decades with a Cuban exile who
contended his efforts to depose Cuban President Fidel Castro by
violent means were financed by a U.S. group.
</P>
<P>
Luis Posada Carriles, who once worked for the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA), told his story in a series of
interviews with The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Posada as saying that he organized a
series of bombings in Cuba last year at hotels, discos and
restaurants, killing an Italian tourist in September.
</P>
<P>
Posada, 70, who was trained in demolition and guerrilla warfare
by the CIA, said the bombings were supported by the anti-Castro
Cuban-American National Foundation in Miami.
</P>
<P>
"We have not had a relationship with this person in decades,"
State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"In general the United States has repeatedly and strongly
condemned violent activities carried out against Cuba, allegedly
supported by persons or groups based in the United States," Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. government has investigated and will continue to
investigate allegations and prosecute violations of U.S. law," he
added.
</P>
<P>
According to The New York Times, Posada said over the years,
Jorge Mas Canosa, founder of the Cuban-American National
Foundation, sent him more than 200,000 U.S. dollars for his
operations against the Cuban leader.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Supports Arafat on Palestinian Statehood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Egypt supports Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat's determination to establish a Palestinian
state no matter what result of negotiations with Israel, Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Their right to establish a state is an international right,"
Moussa said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Moussa is in Washington to strengthen strategic ties with the
United States and to discuss U.S. economic and military aid for
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
He said Israel had already accepted a Palestinian state by
recognizing the Palestinians as a people and the PLO as their
representative. "That goes with it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Oslo agreement provides for that," he added, referring to
the 1993 accord that set up the peace talks between Israel and the
Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's position obviously differs with that of the United
States. The Clinton administration has said the issue of the
Palestinian statehood is the one that should be negotiated between
Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
It opposed the U.N. General Assembly decision to extend
recognition as a virtual state to the PLO while Egypt supported
that decision.
</P>
<P>
Moussa also blamed Israel for the stalemate in negotiations
with the Palestinians over a series of issues, including the
second phase of Israeli troops' withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The United States has proposed that Israel concedes a further
13 percent of territory from the West Bank to the Palestinians,
which, while accepted by Arafat, has been rejected by Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the ground of security.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said Israel's resistance to the U.S. proposal could only
lead to disaster, to violence.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times has reported that Israeli and U.S. officials
expected talks on the U.S. proposal on the Israeli withdrawal from
the West Bank to be concluded by the end of July. But Moussa said
he did not believe Israel and the Palestinians could reach a peace
deal by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think so. We have heard that several times before," he
said. "The gap is still wide.... I don't think in that period of
time it will be possible to reach agreement."

<P>
Ethiopia has diverted from Assab port of Eritrea to port of
Djibouti as its outlet since the outbreak of Ethio-Eritrean

<P>
According to The New York Times, Posada said over the years,
Jorge Mas Canosa, founder of the Cuban-American National
Foundation, sent him more than 200,000 U.S. dollars for his
operations against the Cuban leader.
</P>
<P>
Mas, who died last year, was embraced at the White House by
former presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush and President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"A powerful force in both Florida and national elections, and a
prodigious campaign donor, Mr Mas played a decisive role in
persuading Mr. Clinton to change his mind and follow a course of
sanctions and isolation against Mr. Castro's Cuba," said the
paper.

<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Beijing drivers will be subject to
a point system beginning Wednesday, with accumulated points
determining the need for driver's education courses or other
specified penalties.
</P>
<P>
The system includes points for various offenses, including
various levels of intoxication, driving in the wrong lanes,
turning left at a pedestrian crossing, and displaying an
inappropriate license plate.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Public Security Bureau indicates that drivers can
also be cited for other 98 violations rated between one and 12
points.

UNITED NATIONS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of the

<HEADLINE> Justice Department to Appeal Secret Service Testimony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Justice Department
said Tuesday it will appeal a court decision compelling Secret
Service personnel to testify in the Monica Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
Bert Brandenburg, Attorney General Janet Reno's chief
spokesman, said the Justice Department, which represents the
Secret Service, was filing notice asking the full U.S. Court of
Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to reconsider the case.
</P>
<P>
A three-judge panel of the court ruled last week that
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr can question Secret Service
personnel before the grand jury looking into allegations that
President Bill Clinton had an affair with former White House
intern Lewinsky, then lied about it and asked her to lie.
</P>
<P>
Six of the full court's 11 judges would have to agree to
reconsider the case. If the full appeals court does not rehear the
case, the Justice Department could ask the Supreme Court to
consider it.
</P>
<P>
If the full court hears the appeal, it would set Starr further
back in his attempt to question Secret Service personnel about
what they saw and heard about any relationship between Clinton and
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Justice Department lawyers argued unsuccessfully that forcing
an agent to reveal the actions and words of the president could
undermine trust between the president and his bodyguards and
increase the chances of an assassination.
</P>
<P>
In its decision last Tuesday, the three appeals court judges
said it should be left to Congress to determine "whether a
protective function is appropriate in order to ensure the safety
of the president, and, if so, what the contours of that privilege"
should be.
</P>
<P>
Starr is seeking testimony from two uniformed Secret Service
officers and an agency lawyer about what they or others learned
while guarding Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Russia Threatens to Withdraw Peacekeepers from Abkhazia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Russia Foreign Ministry Tuesday
warned that Russia may withdraw its peacekeeping forces from
Abkhazia, a breakaway Georgian region, if terrorist activity
continues against the peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, in a special statement
issued on Tuesday, the Russian Foreign Ministry condemned a
terrorist attack on Russian peacekeepers in the Gali district on
Monday night in which five servicemen were killed and another
three wounded.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that "the command of the Russian
peacekeeping troops was instructed to take measures for dealing
with terrorist groups on both sides of the security zone which is
subject to the mandate of the joint peacekeeping forces."
</P>
<P>
Russia is indignant at a joint statement by the Georgian
Interior and National Security Ministries "which does not contain
a word of regret over the killing of Russian servicemen but
contains a great deal of groundless accusations against the
peacekeeping forces and their command."
</P>
<P>
The two Georgian ministries in the joint statement accused the
Russian servicemen of looting and connivance with violence, the
news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign ministry also criticized Georgia for
ignoring its obligation to take effective measures to stop
terrorist and sabotage groups, armed units and armed persons from
penetrating into Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
Abkhazia seeking independence from Georgia has been in armed
conflicts with the Georgian government since 1991.
</P>
<P>
Both Georgia and Abkhazia are not meeting their commitments to
the peacekeepers, while the breakaway region has not yet created
conditions for the return of refugees to the Gali district, the
Russian ministry was quoted by Interfax as saying.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Inflation Keeps Low Level in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to falling prices for
gasoline, lettuce, computers and cars, the U.S. inflation dipped
to nearly nothing in June, the Labor Department reported here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased a scant seasonally
adjusted 0.1 percent higher in June after rising a moderate 0.3
percent in the previous month, the most in a year and a half,
according to the department.
</P>
<P>
For the first half of the year, inflation ran at a 1.4 percent
annual rate, compared with an 11-year low of 1.7 percent for all
of last year. Much of that performance was attributable to energy
costs, which have fallen during five of the past six months.
</P>
<P>
They declined 0.7 percent in June and dropped at a 12.1 percent
annual rate during the first half of the year. Gasoline costs fell
0.9 percent in June and declined at a 21.1 percent rate for the
first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, the Commerce Department reported that
consumer spending showed signs of slowing in June. Retail sales,
which make up about half of consumer spending and about a third of
overall economic activity, increased a lackluster 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
That followed a much more robust 1.2 percent increase in May,
the best in 10 months. In June, auto sales rose 0.1 percent but
department-store receipts fell 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the food and energy sectors, where prices swing
widely, prices crept up 0.1 percent. However, for the year so far,
inflation in these "core prices" were slightly worse than last
year. They're up at a 2.5 percent annual rate compared with a 2.2
percent rise for all of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Falling oil prices aren't the only factor helping taming the
inflation. Asia's currency devaluations have brought down import
prices and that has forced U.S. goods manufacturers to hold the
line on their prices.
</P>
<P>
New-car costs, for instance, fell 0.3 percent in June and were
down at a 1 percent annual rate for the first half of the year.
Computer prices fell 3.3 percent last month after drops of 4.5
percent in May and 2.4 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco costs, a hot spot for much of the year, fell 0.6
percent last month but were still up at a 12.1 percent annual rate
for the first half.
</P>
<P>
Medical care, which like many service industries is seeing more
inflation than goods-producing industries, rose 0.4 percent in
June and was up at a 3.7 percent rate for the first half.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, food prices rose just 0.1 percent in June after a
worrisome 0.6 percent surge in May. Lettuce prices dropped 28.1
percent and tomatoes were down 6.3 percent. Still, lettuce costs
were 28.5 percent higher than a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Cheaper PCs More Profitable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Compaq Computer Corp. said its
cheapest computer is now its most profitable consumer personal
computer, a surprising change in an industry where low prices have
long been associated with slim profits.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the Wall Street Journal, accelerating
sales and sharp drop in costs pushed the margin on Compaq's 899-
U.S.-dollar computer, which is also its biggest seller, above its
more expensive consumer PCs.
</P>
<P>
Compaq's consumer unit represents less than 20 percent of
revenue only, but it is expected to be one of the few bright spots
in the company's second-quarter financial statement, which will be
released Wednesday, the paper said. Compaq will report a loss of
more than 5 billion U.S. dollars after special charges related to
its 9-billion-U.S.-dollar acquisition of Digital Equipment Corp..
</P>
<P>
Through the first five months of the year, the period for which
the latest data are available, Compaq led the U.S. retail market
with a 32 percent share in desktop systems; about 46 percent of
its models sold for less than 1,000 U.S. dollars, according to ZD
Market Intelligence.
</P>
<P>
For PC makers, the home market for years has produced the
slimmest profit margins, usually well under 10 percent. However,
Compaq Chief Executive Officer Eckhard Pfeiffer said in April that
its consumer division had reached the double-digit profit-margin
range.

<HEADLINE> More Flood Control Preparations Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- China is currently entering the
annual flood season and the State Flood Control and Drought Relief
Headquarters today issued a circular urging all localities prepare
to protect the well-being and property of possibly affected people.
</P>
<P>
The circular noted that water levels have exceeded the flood
stage in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The rain zone has
moved to north and northeast China where heavy rainfall will quite
likely cause surging currents on rivers, including the Yellow
River, the country's second longest.
</P>
<P>
Two or more tropical storms or typhoons are likely to hit coastal
areas in July, according to the circular.
</P>
<P>
The document called on local governments to adequately prepare
for flood control by stocking both goods and materials, as well as
to reinforce water conservation projects and repair and clear
waterways to ensure the smooth flow of flood waters.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be made to guarantee that people in
flood-stricken areas have adequate food, drinking water, clothing,
shelters and medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
The circular stressed that the diversion of funds earmarked for
flood control for any other purpose is strictly prohibited and any
violations involving misallocations will be subject to severe
punishment.

<HEADLINE> Non-State Economic Sectors Urged to Participate In Re-employment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Wang Zhaoguo, vice-chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), today called on non-state economic sectors to
participate in the reemployment program to help unemployed workers
faced with difficult situations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a reemployment work conference held today in
Beijing, Wang said the non-State economy has witnessed
considerable progress and has emerged as a new economic growth
point since introduction of the reform and opening policies.
</P>
<P>
Statistics through the end of 1997 show that China has
registered more than 28 million self-employed individuals and
960,000 private enterprises which employ over 85 million people.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the government should encourage non-State enterprises
to increase their actual strength, while encouraging related
ventures to participate in the reform, transformation and
reorganization of State-owned enterprises by participating in
mergers, rentals, leases and outright purchases.
</P>
<P>
Jing Shuping, vice-chairman of the CPPCC National Committee and
president of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce,
said that participation in the reemployment effort also represents
an opportunity for the development of non-State enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He said related enterprises can absorb more skilled staffer and
expand their business scope at relatively low costs.

<HEADLINE> Hungry Sudanese Stream into Government Garrison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 14 (Xinhua) -- As hunger spreads in southern
Sudan, thousands of Sudanese are pouring into governmental
garrison towns to escape fighting and food shortage, the U.N.
World Food Program reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The fighting rages as small bands of unidentified armed men
are launching attacks and raiding local villages, causing
thousands of people to flee, said a WFP news release issued here.
</P>
<P>
The great influx is into Wau, the second largest
government-led town in the south. The town received an average
of 2,500 people per day in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
WFP has registered and is feeding 50,000 people who have
arrived since May. WFP now airlifts into Wau 300 tons of food
every week, doubling the number it has been bringing in since the
airlift began on May 30.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the women and children are horrendously
malnourished," Ismat Fahmi, WFP's deputy representative in
Khartoum, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Their weakened state is frighteningly similar to what we've
been seeing in some rebel-held areas of the south," said Fahmi.
</P>
<P>
Other government-held towns have also been receiving influxes
of people although on a smaller scale, according to the U.N. food
agency.
</P>
<P>
In Aweil, Bahr el Ghazal Province, at least 9,000 people need
humanitarian assistance. In Abyei and Meiram, west Kordofan area,
more than 15,000 are being fed by WFP.
</P>
<P>
"We're spending hours interviewing families to discover the
root causes for their sudden migration," said Fahmi. "More and
more, we are hearing that lack of food, disease and raids by
armed men are a big factor, forcing entire communities to flee
their villages."
</P>
<P>
Last week, WFP's Executive Director Catherine Bertini called
on the international community to make efforts in ending the
15-year war in southern Sudan between the Muslim-led government
and rebels fighting for more autonomy in animist and
Christian-populated southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The WFP is U.N.'s front-line agency in the fight against
global hunger.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Build Joint Venture Cement Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Construction work on a
Bangladesh-France joint-venture cement plant in the private sector
will begin early next year, the national BSS news agency reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
All formalities have already been completed for buying lime
stone -- the raw material for producing cement -- from India, said
Michel Folliet, Managing Director of the French Lafarge-Surma
Company.
</P>
<P>
The 200-million-U.S.-dollar plant will be built in the
country's northeast district of Sylhet, the land development work
of which will begin in early September this year.
</P>
<P>
The plant, to be built with the most modern technology, would
initially produce 1.2 million tons of fine-quality cement
annually, Folliet said.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture cement plant, when completed, could save
Bangladesh 100 million dollars in foreign exchange for importing
cement from abroad, and create at least 2,000 jobs, he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, Bangladesh's cement consumption is between 3.5
million and 4 million tons a year, but the country's annual cement
production stands at about 1.2 million tons. Therefore, the
country has to spend a huge sum of foreign currency on importing
an average 2.4 million tons of cement every year.

PARIS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- After successfully playing host to
the 1998 World Cup football tournament, France is considering to
apply for the hosting of the 2008 Olympic games in Paris,
according to Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
"We will study the possibility of an Olympic candidature, as we
are encouraged by the success of the World Cup," Paris mayor Jean
Tiberi told AFP during the National Day garden party at the Elysee
presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the city will be very prudent in
decision-making over the issue, because it needs agreement from
all levels to make all elements converge.
</P>
<P>
"An Olympic candidature is not decided like that (World
Cup). One needs a certain number of agreements which engage many
people, to begin with the government and several local
communities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tiberi said that when applying for hosting Olympics, Paris will
also take into account the calendar the Olympics and potential
rival cities.
</P>
<P>
Five cities -- Osaka, Toronto, Istanbul, Seville and Buenos
Aires have expressed interest in being the candidates for the
Olympics.

BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
Premier Zhu Rongji held a meeting and talks today, respectively,
on separate occasions with Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko
and the leaders of both countries pledged to continue their
efforts to develop bilateral relations based on equality and
mutual trust oriented to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko, who paid a one-day working visit to China at the
invitation of his Chinese counterpart Zhu Rongji, exchanged views
with Chinese leaders on bilateral relations and major world issues
of common concern in a friendly, candid, and practical atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Jiang and Kiriyenko discussed matters relating to the informal
summit between the two heads of state scheduled for early
September this year, and both were of the same view that the
coming summit will be very important. They expressed determination
to join their efforts to ensure the success of the summit.
</P>
<P>
Zhu and Kiriyenko agreed that since the initiation of the
mechanism for regular meetings between prime ministers of the two
countries in December 1996, it has played an important role in
stimulating bilateral economic and trade cooperation. Both
expressed the willingness to further increase the efficiency and
vigor of meetings, and urged the working committee and all
sub-committees to accelerate efforts to prepare for the fourth
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from the two countries also touched on the most urgent
issues in bilateral economic and trade cooperation, and the
implementation of the agreements reached during the third regular
meeting between the two prime ministers held in Moscow in February
1998.
</P>
<P>
Prime ministers of the two countries pointed out that
Sino-Russian economic and trade cooperation is based on a solid
foundation, and they urged relevant departments to adopt specific
measures to implement related agreements and documents in order to
fully tap the potentials for bilateral cooperation in various
sectors, including nuclear energy, new and high technologies,
energy, civil aviation and communications.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to explore new spheres and means of
cooperation which is needed to achieve diversity in economic and
trade relations and promote cooperation between local and border
regions in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from both countries agreed that continuous development
of cooperation between China and Russia on the basis of long-term
mutual benefit not only will be in the fundamental interests of
people of the two nations, but also be an important factor in
safeguarding world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Zhu graciously accepted Kiriyenko's invitation to pay an
official visit to Russia next year.
</P>
<P>
The Russian prime minister left here for home earlier tonight.

<HEADLINE> Warmer Ocean Water Devastates Marine Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The temperature of the ocean
along the U.S. West Coast, appears to have been warming steadily
since 1977, thus devastating marine life off California, according to
a report from The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La
Jolla, Calif., studied sea-surface temperatures along the West
Coast over the past 80 years and found large fluctuations in
temperature.
</P>
<P>
Since 1977, surface temperatures have increased by about 2
degrees Fahrenheit. The warmer water appears to have significant
effect on coastal ecosystems, leading to severe declines in
microscopic plankton, forests of kelp and the fish, birds and
mammals that feed on them.
</P>
<P>
But the scientists say it is unclear how much of the warmer
water is being caused by natural fluctuations.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Hussein left here
Tuesday to undergo medical check in the United States after
suffering fatigue resulted from a high fever.
</P>
<P>
After arriving in the U.S., the king, accompanied by his
U.S.-born Queen Noor, will receive medical check at the Mayo
Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. The king used to have physical
examinations at this clinic twice a year.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's official news agency Petra quoted the king as saying
before his departure that he suffered from high temperatures at
an average of three times a day.
</P>
<P>
The king had undergone tests in Amman but nothing serious was
found, so he wanted to go to the U.S. for further examination,
said the news agency.
</P>
<P>
After visiting the U.S., King Hussein is expected in France
from July 21 to 23. He will meet President Jacques Chirac, Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin and other senior government officials there.
</P>
<P>
Their talks will deal with the latest developments of the
Mideast peace process as well as ways of pushing it forward,
especially on the Palestinian-Israeli track, Petra said.
</P>
<P>
The talks are also expected to cover bilateral relations and
ways of promoting them in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Hussein's last visit to France was in June last year. Chirac
paid an official visit to Jordan in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
Israel still sticks to a hard-line policy by expanding the
boundary of Jerusalem and rejecting a U.S. peace proposal which
calls for a 13.1 percent Israeli troops withdrawal from the West
Bank. The Palestinians have accepted the proposal.

<HEADLINE> EU Sends German Envoy to Reopen Talks with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will send a
German envoy to Minsk to try to resolve a dispute with the Belarus
government over diplomatic residences, the German Foreign Ministry
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under a decision made by EU foreign ministers in Brussels,
Germany's ambassador to Belarus, Horst Winkelmann, would return to
Minsk as the EU envoy to start the negotiations, the Foreign
Ministry added.
</P>
<P>
Winkelmann and ambassadors of Britain, France, Greece, Italy as
well as the United States were recalled from Minsk in June in
protest against a Belarus move to evict about 20 ambassadors from
their residences in Drozdy, a park-like compound they share with
President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus.
</P>
<P>
The diplomats had been ordered by the Belarus authorities to
move out while repairs to the antiquated water and sewer system in
the residential compound took place.
</P>
<P>
Most of the envoys resisted, saying that their residences were
sovereign territory under the Vienna Convention.
</P>
<P>
Belarus reportedly had cut off water and electricity and barred
access to the houses.
</P>
<P>
The EU, however, saw a "positive signal" from a letter sent by
Lukashenko, in which he reportedly said that Minsk was ready to
discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
The letter was sent Saturday to Austria, which currently holds
the EU rotating presidency.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) foreign
ministers have decided to impose a non-admission on all
high-ranking officials of Belarus into EU member countries.
</P>
<P>
The decision, said a European council of ministers press
release, was made at their meeting Monday through Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the ministers condemned what they called the
"violation by Belarus of the Vienna Convention on diplomatic
relations" in its eviction of European envoys from residences in
Minsk.
</P>
<P>
The EU member states have already withdrawn their resident
ambassadors in the Belarussian capital and have requested
Belarussian ambassadors in EU capitals to return to Minsk.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia,
Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Iceland and Norway have all
declared to conform their policies with the EU position.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the 15-member EU and Belarus took a down turn
when the Belarussian authorities cut off electricity and water
supplies and telephone services to the EU ambassadors' residences.
</P>
<P>
Minsk said the move was for maintenance work at the residences.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers said early actions by Belarus to
respect fully the Vienna Convention would enable a return to
normal the bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Has to Be Careful before Signing CTBT: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar
Ayub Khan said Tuesday Pakistan has to be very careful before
considering signing of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
Talking to the media in Lahore, Gohar said the positions of
Pakistan and India in regard to defense and balance of power are
differenct due to which Pakistan cannot link signing of CTBT with
India's attitude towards the Treaty or non-proliferation.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the CTBT is not a simple thing for which
tremendous pressure is being exerted on Pakistan, Gohar noted.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the CTBT, he said it includes Fissile Materials
Control Treaty (FMCT) which is something very serious as Pakistan
has far less Uranium than India and it has to see the strategic
and nuclear imbalance struck with the Indian test explosions.
</P>
<P>
"We have to correct the imbalance of power," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Minister said the Secretary General of the United
Nations, Kofi Annan, is coming to Pakistan before the Summit of
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation scheduled to be
held in Colombo at the end of this month for re-structuring the
talks between Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
Similarly wide ranging meetings will also be held with U.S.
Deputy Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs Strobe Talbott
when he visits pakistan on July 23 and 24 to evolve strategy for
hitting the core issue (Kashmir) between Pakistan and India to get
some concrete solution.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question, he said Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had
four meetings with former Indian Premier Inder K. Gujral, which
like other 50 bilateral talks, were fruitless.
</P>
<P>
In view of this experience, Pakistan now wants some meaningful
dialogues with its neighbor of India.

BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Floods which have hit 10 Chinese
provinces in recent weeks have adversely affected 4.19 million ha
of arable land, destroyed crops on 2.05 million ha and prevented
the cultivation of an additional 640,000 ha, according to
government sources.
</P>
<P>
The State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters and the
Ministry of Water Resources report that concerned provinces and
autonomous regions have strengthened flood control efforts.
</P>
<P>
Some 96,000 water pumps were used to drain 3.49 million
ha. of waterlogged fields by July 13. The fields involved had the
potential to yield crops valued at 14.6 billion yuan (1.79 US
dollars), according to statistics released by the headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu, Hubei and Anhui provinces in the Yangtze River Valley
have responded quickly to flooding, as have the provinces of
Guangdong and Hunan.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi Province and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region
have responded somewhat slower due to the fact that they are
either poorly equipped or are besieged with overflowing lakes,
according to the headquarters.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Credit Unions Eye Banding Together </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The credit union industry in Canada
is examining a proposal that could turn the grass-roots movement
into banks, a report said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A new national task force has been formed to examine whether
the credit unions can better combine the delivery of their
services under one umbrella.
</P>
<P>
Bobby McVeigh, head of the task force, said he expects a system
with standardized service and products across the country, "so it
doesn't matter where I am doing business."
</P>
<P>
However, McVeigh said, the planned restructuring would continue
to emphasize community roots.
</P>
<P>
The task force was expected to table a report by the end of
this summer. It would then be put to a vote.
</P>
<P>
More than 4.2 million Canadians belong to credit unions.
Across the country, there are 873 credit unions with total assets
worth 32 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The industry has been under pressure to develop a strategy to
get a better position themselves in the fast-changing
financial-service sector.

<P>
Li joined in discussions and solicited the opinions of
government officials from various departments in Changchun
concerning the law on land management.
</P>
<P>
Officials stressed the need for tight controls on land
distribution right, and contended that related rights should
remain in the hands of either the central or provincial
governments. Others proposed that law should include articles on
the development and regulation of the real estate market.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China's over 900 million rural people depend on
land. Nonetheless, substantial tracts of arable land have been
lost to new construction projects and waste in recent years. The
new land management law must ensure sustainable growth for our
country's future, said Li.
</P>
<P>
Presidents and Party secretaries from 13 Jilin universities and
colleges expressed their opinions concerning the nation's first
higher education law which is currently under consideration by the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
Li agreed that the university presidents should be granted
greater authority over the management and development of
respective universities.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the existing educational system should be
reformed to produce versatile graduates needed for the constantly
changing society and market.
</P>
<P>
Li also explored the difficulties state-owned enterprises face
in the former heavy industrial base, in addition to holding
discussions with government and enterprise officials concerning
redundant workers and the social security system.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Capable to Come Out Of Economic Crisis: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif said Tuesday that Pakistan is fully capable of wriggling
out of the current economic crisis as it has inherent potential to
face challenges.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani people will come out of the crisis very well,
Sharif said at a meeting attended by economic experts and
businessmen at the Prime Minister House, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
"All attempts to exploit post-May 28 developments by the vested
interests would fail and the nation would soon tide over its
difficulties," Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
He said the present economic crisis is a temporary one and
would be over soon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sharif noted that "nothing is more precious than the
preservation of our political independence and territorial
integrity."
</P>
<P>
"If any arm-twisting tactic is applied to Pakistan, the country
would resist it with full force and might," Sharif said, adding:
"We will never submit to any amount of coercion or pressure."
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan's detonation of nuclear tests on May 28 was
necessary to ensure the continued existence of the country as an
independent and sovereign nation.
</P>
<P>
He also made it clear that Pakistan is a peace-loving country
and it has no aggressive designs against any country.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly believe in economic and social development of the
region," he added.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the country's economic situation was
reviewed and a number of suggestions to improve it were
considered.
</P>
<P>
Sharif asked the participants to make specific recommendations
for the uplift of the economy and for enhancing the country's
foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the participants to suggest ways and means for
protecting the poor and needy from the negative trend of price
hikes and providing them with special safety nets.
</P>
<P>
Economic experts at the meeting will continue deliberations for
three days to finalize their recommendations to overcome the
economic problems facing the country.
</P>
<P>
These recommendations will be presented to the prime minister.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Inflation Set to Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's year-on-year inflation
continues to rise and was pegged at 29.8 percent for the month of
June.
</P>
<P>
This represents a 0.5 percentage point increase from the level
of 29.3 percent in May, according to the latest review released
here Tuesday by central statistical office on price trends.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe News Agency quoted analysts as saying that the
increase was mainly due to an upsurge in the consumer prices of
food items and medical care.
</P>
<P>
They expected inflation to be above 30 percent by the year
end, which means the inflation target of 19 percent set by the
International Monetary Fund would not be achieved.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales In UK Show First Fall In Three Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Britain's retailers suffered their
worst sales performance for more than three years in June as
interest rate rises, cold and wet weather and the World Cup kept
consumers away from the high street.
</P>
<P>
The British Retail Consortium's latest sales monitor, published
Tuesday, shows a 0.1 percent fall in sales last month compared
with a year earlier -- the first decline since March 1995.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Higginson, Chairman of the Consortium's Economic Affairs
Committee, said: "The appalling weather affected sales badly in
some sectors, and the World Cup kept viewers at home on match
days."
</P>
<P>
"This move into negative territory confirms the slowdown in
sales that we have seen for some time," he added.
</P>
<P>
Retailers in the clothing, footwear and furniture sectors were
hardest hit with the wet weather heavily affecting sales of summer
stock.
</P>
<P>
The consortium also said the series of interest rate increases
since the same period last year continued to hurt consumer
confidence and high-street spending.
</P>
<P>
The strong pound and Tube strikes were among the main causes
for the retail sales slump last month, it added.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Palestinians Welcome U.N. Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Tuesday welcomed the U.N. Security Council
statement that urges Israel not to expand Jerusalem, while Israel
expressed "regret" over it.
</P>
<P>
PNA Cabinet Secretary Ahmad Abdel Rahman told the Voice of
Palestine radio that the Security Council Presidential statement
is a moral and political condemnation to the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet adopted on June 21 a plan for Jerusalem
expansion, which puts some Jewish settlements in the West Bank
under the jurisdiction of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians, who see Jerusalem as the capital of their
future state, sharply criticized the plan, saying it was a
declaration of war against the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Tuesday, the Israeli Foreign Ministry
said "we regret" the U.N. statement passed Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Israel has already clarified that the Cabinet decision of June
21, 1998 does not contradict the agreements between Israel and the
Palestinians," the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The status of Jerusalem is one of the most sensitive and
contentious issues in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. The
agreements signed between the two sides forbid any unilateral
actions to change its status until the final status talks are held.
</P>
<P>
The ministry reiterated that the plan "is municipal in nature"
and is intended to extend Jerusalem's municipal jurisdiction only
to areas west of the city. The Security Council statement "ignores
these facts," it added.
</P>
<P>
"Israel will continue to work for the development and
prosperity of Jerusalem, for the benefit of all its inhabitants,"
the ministry's statement said.
</P>
<P>
Rahman expressed the hope that the Security Council's position
will oblige Israel to halt settlements and expansion policy which
violates the signed agreements and endanger the entire peace
process.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the U.N. statement and its condemnation lacks
the mechanism of forcing Israel to drop its Jerusalem expansion
scheme.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Security Council, which began debate on the
Jerusalem expansion plan early this month, fell short of adopting
a resolution condemning Israel's act as pressed for by many
countries, particularly the Arabs. The United States and Britain
have led a diplomatic drive to prevent the Security Council from
voting on such a resolution.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council Presidential statement said Israel's
Jerusalem expansion plan would pose damage to the Mideast peace
process and asked Israel to stop implementing this plan.
</P>
<P>
The Mideast peace process has been stalled for 16 months since
Israel started to build a settlement in the traditionally Arab
East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani FM Optimistic About IMF Assistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar
Ayub Khan Tuesday expressed his optimism about a positive decision
by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the release of aid to
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Gohar
said the IMF has postponed its decision for another 24 hours on
whether it should continue its financial support to Pakistan or
punish it for going nuclear.
</P>
<P>
IMF has delayed the release of promised financial assistance to
Pakistan under the pressure of G-8 (Group of Eight) countries
because of Pakistan's detonation of nuclear devices at the end of
May.
</P>
<P>
Gohar hoped that the outcome of the IMF Board meeting would be
positive.
</P>
<P>
He said Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has sent missions to
friendly countries to seek their help at such a crucial juncture,
and hoped these efforts would bear fruit.
</P>
<P>
Gohar noted that the people of Pakistan had suffered far worse
conditions at the time of Pakistan's establishment and has the
potential to pass through the prevailing difficult situation
without any complications.
</P>
<P>
The situation is not as bleak as it is being painted by certain
quarters, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that the impact of economic sanctions has
not filtered through yet as it would take four to five months for
the sanctions to hurt the national economy.
</P>
<P>
"We were aware of the sanctions and opted for explosions only
after considering the sanctions and embargoes which will remain
effective for a year," Gohar said.

LONDON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- American teenager Samantha Reeves
tested positive last December for the anabolic steroid nandrolone
in an out-of-competition test, the International Tennis Federation
(ITF) said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But Reeves, 18, would not be punished because of "exceptional
circumstances", according to an ITF statement .
</P>
<P>
"It is accepted that Ms Reeves acted in good faith in taking
the product, believing it to be an aid to weight loss," the ITF
said.
</P>
<P>
"Had she known or suspected that the product had anabolic
characteristics she would not have taken it.
</P>
<P>
"The Appeals Committee concludes that Ms Reeves was naive and
immature at the time of the offence, being 18 years old and having
just joined the professional circuit as an amateur. The Appeals
Committee were satisfied that it would therefore be harsh to
consider her actions unreasonable in the light of her exceptional
circumstances."

<HEADLINE> Pacific Nations Facing Challenge: N.Zealand Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The pace and direction of the
regional and global change have brought a "challenge for small
Pacific nations, such as Fiji and New Zealand," New Zealand
Minister of Commerce and Industry John Luxton said in remarks
available here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Luxton told the annual Fiji-New Zealand Joint Business
Council's Conference, which was recently held in Fiji, that
Pacific Island countries face the challenge of deciding whether to
try to move with the change or not.
</P>
<P>
He said his country's response to globalization has been to
change its direction from one of heavy protection to one which
opens up to trade and competition progressively. "This has
improved New Zealand's position," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"While New Zealand has been buffeted by the Asian situation, we
are fundamentally sound as a result of 15 years of restructuring.
We have become more flexible, responsive, innovative and market
focused," Luxton said.
</P>
<P>
He added: "We must continue to lower costs of doing business,
open up trade and make ourselves internationally competitive."
</P>
<P>
The Fiji-New Zealand Joint Business Council's Conference, which
was established 10 years ago, provides an opportunity for business
interests from Fiji and New Zealand to discuss trade, investment
and economic opportunities and to strengthen the business
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Fiji is an important market for New Zealand, taking about 100
million U.S. dollars of New Zealand's goods and services in 1996.

role as a bridge with the economic links worldwide,
</P>
<P>
Vieira expressed hope that the Chinese side will support the
suggestions of businesspeople from Macao concerning the
construction of large-scale infrastructure, including the proposed
deep water wharf and extending the Guangzhou-Zhuhai Railway to the
region.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that Macao will strengthen cooperation with the EU
in wide-ranging areas, including science, and expressed hope that
China will make full use of Macao's advantages as a bridge to the
outside world.

Vieira pointed out that so doing will not only boost Macao's
development, but will also help to ensure a smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
Zhu expressed confidence in the efforts of the Macao government
to handling matters related to the transition, and improving the
region's social security system. He said the Chinese government
will fully support Portuguese measures favorable to Macao's social
stability and economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Estrada to Consult Congress on Marcos Wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- President Joseph Estrada said
Tuesday that he would consult Congress on a proposed out-of-court
settlement between the government and the Marcoses of the wealth
of late president Ferdinand Marcos.
</P>
<P>
"We will have to ask our congressional leaders about this. I
will seek their advice," he said, confident that with all the
heads of the three branches of government being put together, his
government will not make a mistake in making a deal with the
Marcoses.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Estrada said that if the out-of-court settlement would
"benefit our people, why not...as long as it will be for the
interest of the greater majority of our people and it is legal,
nobody can stop me."
</P>
<P>
According to a deal drafted in 1993, the government and the
Marcoses would divide Marcos' wealth on a 75-25 base in favor of
the government while the share of the Marcoses is tax-free.
</P>
<P>
However, Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said that nothing
definite has yet been reached on the issue between the present
administration and the Marcoses.
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to agree unless we see it on paper," Zamora said, in
response to questions as to whether the tax-free share of the
Marcoses in the 75-25 deal is acceptable to the government.
</P>
<P>
Marcos, who was ousted in 1986 and died three years later in
Hawaii, the United States, has been accused of amassing at least 5
billion dollars of wealth during his 20-year rule of the country.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji today
urged Israel to strictly implement agreements reached with all
Arab parties to ensure key breakthroughs in the difficult Middle
East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remarks during a meeting with Yasser Arafat,
visiting president of the State of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
He noted that while not a mediator in the Middle East issue,
China, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, will join
the international community in extending greater efforts to
promote peace in order to contribute to breaking the current
stalemate.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to China's principled stance in supporting the just
cause of Palestine and said that the Chinese government is greatly
concerned about the situation in the Middle East and the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
China firmly believes that relevant UN resolutions and the "Land
for Peace" principle are the basis for Middle East peace talks,
said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
He said that conflicts between Palestine and Israel over the
past five decades have brought tremendous disaster and suffering
to people in the region and have not only damaged security and
stability in the region, but have also hindered economic
development and prosperity of the countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said it is both fair and reasonable for the Palestinian side
to ask the Israeli government to implement the agreements between
the two sides in a down-to-earth manner.
</P>
<P>
He said that realizing peace and stability in the region at an
early date is the common aspiration of all people, including the
Israeli people. Zhu noted that the Palestinian issue
will eventually be solved due with the joint efforts of Palestine
and Israel and with assistance from the international community.
</P>
<P>
Zhu expressed his appreciation for the wise and practical
policies adopted by the Palestinian government.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to the traditional friendship between China
and Palestine, and expressed China's admiration for the great
efforts to practice self-rule in Palestine. Zhu said China will
continue to render all possible assistance.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said that Palestine values the friendship between the
two peoples and the friendly and cooperative relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Palestine should draw on China's notable achievements in
political, economic and social development, according to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
On the Mideast peace process, he noted that the peace process
is at a standstill and the Palestinian people continue to face
great difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Arafat said, the Palestinian people are determined
to remain united, meet all challenges and continue their efforts
to achieve a permanent peace.

of China (CPC) and governments at and above the county level will
be barred from holding concurrent posts in social organizations,

Council.
</P>
<P>
The new rule will promote the work of separating government
functions from business management, bring the role of mass
organizations into full play as social media, and ensure
"officials concentrate on official responsibilities," according to
the circular.
</P>
<P>
The document covers Communist Party committees officials at and
above the county level, as well as officials in people's
congresses, administrative agencies, political consultative

<HEADLINE> Zambian Manufacturers Urged to Penetrate Southern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of Zambia
Chambers of Commerce and Industry (ZCCI) has urged Zambian
manufacturers to start immediately working on how best to
penetrate the southern African market.
</P>
<P>
In an interview Monday in Lusaka, Gideon Phiri, chief
executive of ZCCI called on local manufacturers to take advantage
of the trade agreement Zambia signed Monday with Southern African
Customs Union (SACU) member countries, The Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It is time for local manufacturers to start penetrating the
South African market which offers an estimated 100 million U.S.
Dollars for the first year of trade, said Phiri.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Zambia's manufacturing sector stands to gain
massively from the trade agreement because South Africa will not
demand reciprocal levels of trade after the agreement becomes
effective.
</P>
<P>
Phiri attached importance to the quality of goods and advising
the producers to produce goods according to market needs.
</P>
<P>
"We should not belittle the quality of the products we are
producing because quality is dependent of the market," said
Phiri, adding "a manufacturer will produce goods according to
what this market requires."
</P>
<P>
Under the trade agreement signed in Pretoria, South Africa,
Zambia will have a reciprocal trade arrangement with other SACU
member countries including Lesotho, Swaziland, Botswana, Namibia
and South Africa while a non-reciprocal scheme to allow Zambian
foods to enter duty free will apply toward South Africa.
</P>
<P>
On his departure Sunday for South Africa to sign the
agreement, Enock Kavindele, Minister of Commerce, Trade and
Industry said the trade pact will help boost Zambia's exports to
the southern African region.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has complained in the past years that its trade
partners in the region have been trying to make Zambia a dumping
ground for their goods by providing subsidies to their companies
since the country liberalized its economy in early 1990s and the
play ground is not level.
</P>
<P>
Zambian products have been finding it difficult to enter these
markets while products from the same countries have been flooding
the local market at cheap prices compared with the same Zambian
products.

HONG KONG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The number of young drug abusers
in Hong Kong dropped by 8.6 percent in the first quarter of 1998
compared with a year ago, according to the Central Registry of
Drugs Abuse (CRDA).
</P>
<P>
Overall there is a 3.3 percent drop to 6,103 in the number of
drug abusers of all ages, according to a report released by CRDA
Tuesday at a quarterly meeting of the Action Committee Against
Narcotics (ACAN).
</P>
<P>
Among the drug abusers reported in the first quarter, those
aged below 21 accounted for 1,006, down from 1,101 in the same
period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Delighted by the drop in young drug abusers, a spokesman for
ACAN said young people remain a major target of ACAN's ongoing
preventive education and publicity programs.
</P>
<P>
All the efforts are aimed at helping young people "refuse drug
offers, stay away from drugs and cope with problems in life
instead of resorting to drugs," the spokesman said.

PARIS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac said
on Tuesday that the Asia financial crisis worries France but has
so far not brought direct harm to the its economy.
</P>
<P>
In a traditional television interview on the National Day of
France, Chirac said that growth has returned to France although it
is not expected to reduce the number of chronically unemployed in
France.
</P>
<P>
"Growth has returned, there is no doubt about it. But it is
not sufficient to cut long duration unemployment," he said.
</P>
<P>
He regretted that resumption of economic growth now remains
restricted to Europe instead of around the world.
</P>
<P>
"This is a European phenomenon, it is not true for the whole
world. There is a troubling crisis in Asia, which can have
repercussion in our country, even though it has not happened up to
now, mainly thanks to the perspective of the euro which has given
confidence to the market as for what concerns Europe," he said.

<HEADLINE> HK to Retain Competitiveness in Garment Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is still able to
retain a competitive edge in the garment industry, said Chan Wing
Kee, council member of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council,
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This is because local manufacturers have set up low cost
offshore bases around the world, especially in the Chinese
mainland.
</P>
<P>
Even with currency devaluation elsewhere in the region, the
production cost in the Chinese mainland is still competitive
compared with other Asian countries, Chan said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the Fashion Week for
Spring/Summer '99 from July 14 to 17, Chan noted that Hong Kong
remains the preferred sourcing center in the Asia-Pacific region
for international fashion as Hong Kong manufacturers and traders
are reputed to be stable, reliable, and efficient in managing
product development, production and quality control.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said Hong Kong has also evolved into a service
center in which design and marketing are the key areas of
expertise, with many local designers making a name for themselves
in the domestic and international markets.
</P>
<P>
In face of the changing market demand and increasing
competition from other countries, especially from Asian countries,
he said that quick response has become increasingly important for
Hong Kong garment industry.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Asian currency crisis should not have a marked
impact on Hong Kong garment exports in the short term but will
most likely lead to intensified price competition in the medium
term.
</P>
<P>
In response, Hong Kong garment manufacturers should continue to
sharpen their competitiveness in terms of price and quality, while
shortening delivery time by using sophisticated production methods
and modern communications technologies to supply the right
products in precise quantities, he said.
</P>
<P>
Garment industry is still Hong Kong's leading exporter,
with total exports of clothing and clothing accessories exceeding
178.8 billion HK dollars (22.92 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997, he
said, adding that the Fashion Week reinforces the importance of
its garment industry.
</P>
<P>
At this Spring/Summer event, 314 exhibitors from 13 countries
and regions are displaying a wide array of high quality fashion
products, ranging from fashion garments to accessories and
trade-related services.
</P>
<P>
The fashion design talents of the region will demonstrate their
design artistry and creative craftsmanship in a series of fashion
shows, further enhancing Hong Kong's leading status as the
region's fashion center.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Comments On Peace For Palestinian People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat, wearing his trademark headdress and military uniform and
punctuating his remarks with strong gestures, told Chinese
journalists in a meeting today that his life-long pursuit has been
to let the Palestinian people live freely in a free-land.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the Palestinian cause is reaching an end, he said
here at the beginning of a three-day official visit at the
invitation of President Jiang Zemin, even thought the peace talks
have been stalemated.
</P>
<P>
He said that there should be more pressure from the
international community to force the Israeli government to change
its position and implement the agreements already reached between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"Peace is not only for Palestine and Israel, but for the entire
Middle East region," Arafat said, "If peace is not protected, we
will fight hard to save peace."
</P>
<P>
Israel should make an effort to break the current deadlock in
the Mideast peace talks so that the Mideast issue can be resolved
in a comprehensive, just and thorough way, he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who is on his eleventh China visit, said that China is
part of an international balance in the peace process and can play
a bigger role in the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He said he had frank and detailed discussions with President
Jiang on the Mideast peace process and the Palestinian cause and
that the Palestinians will never forget China's continuous support.
</P>
<P>
Arafat devoted himself to the Palestine liberation cause when
he was still a young man. Now approaching his 70s, he witnessed
the vicissitudes of the Palestinian cause in the past decades.
</P>
<P>
Some 24 years ago, Arafat first addressed the UN General
Assembly at the beginning of the Palestine Liberation
Organization. The PLO, then under his chairmanship, was granted
observer status in the UN.
</P>
<P>
The 52nd UN General Assembly last Tuesday approved a resolution
to upgrade the status of Palestine to near statehood from that of
observer and Arafat called this support from the international
community for the cause of peace.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Arafat was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize together with
his long-time foes, the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
and former Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. After that time
he gave up his pistol at public occasions, even though it had been
a part of him for decades.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process will no doubt move forward, he
said, because it is the common aspiration of the Palestinians, the
Israelis, the Arabs, and the whole international community.
</P>
<P>
He said that Palestinians have the right to declare an
independent Palestinian state in May 1999 in accordance with
relevant international agreements, and the schedule remains
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
"I'm in good health and confident to see the advent of peace in
the Middle East region," he concluded.

BRUSSELS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- European Commissioner for
External Affairs Hans van den Broek showed on Tuesday European
Commission's assistance to gypsies in eastern Europe by starting a
truck carrying charity materials bound for Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
The truck contained a brick-making machine that was donated to
a social housing project in Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
The donation was made by European college graduates who have
worked as interns in the European Commission. Twice a year some
600 graduates participate in this traineeship program.
</P>
<P>
There is now an estimated total of 8 million Roma/gypsies in
Europe after they started leaving northeastern India in the 11th
century.
</P>
<P>
A vast majority of the gypsies, 6 million, now live in central
and eastern Europe, ranging from between 1.8 million and 2.5
million in Romania to between 8,000 and 10,000 in Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
Commission officials said that as a minority, Roma/gypsies
communities tend to suffer from social and cultural exclusion in
most European countries and their nomadic way of life have
rendered the defense of their rights difficult.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Stock Market Ends Weaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Share prices continued to slide
Tuesday on Singapore Stock Market as sentiment remained weary amid
the recessionary gloom in the region.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) lost 10.70
points to close at 1,042.44 points.
</P>
<P>
Total market volume dropped to 89.78 million shares valued at
139.69 million Singapore dollars (82.17 million U.S. dollars).
Gainers led losers by 135 to 121 while 337 stocks remained
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
DBS Land, a major developer, remained the most active stock as
it registered a turnover of 5.85 million units. It was followed by
MBF Cap which had 4.85 million shares done. UOB F was next with
2.72 million shares changing hands.
</P>
<P>
ChemInde was the top gainer of the day as it gained 30 cents to
end at 2.10 Singapore dollars. OCBC F edged up 15 cents to finish

</P>
<P>

Tuesday's early trading by firmer regional currencies, closed
marginally softer with trading thinned by the absence of fresh
factors.
</P>
<P>
Activity was from investors and broking houses trading their
property accounts on an intraday basis.
</P>
<P>
Dealers also said fears of more corporate failures in the
region, uncertainty toward Japan's economic reforms and the threat
of a slowdown in the region's economies put a lid on gains.
</P>
<P>
They also said the market was awaiting more news from Japan,
and needed to hear news about Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto's successor and where the country's economic reform were
headed for clearer near-term direction.

<HEADLINE> Kim Jong-pil Allowed to Continue Acting as Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Constitutional Court of South
Korea Tuesday dismissed as improper the demand by the major
opposition Grand National Party (GNP) to declare unconstitutional
the appointment of Kim Jong-pil as acting prime minister by
President Kim Dae-jung without parliamentary approval.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that the GNP lawmakers have no right to bring
the case to the court, saying that the parliament is authorized to
bring the case to the court through a resolution.
</P>
<P>
"That's because the appointment of the prime minister is the
sole right of the National Assembly (parliament), not the right of
individual lawmakers," said the court.
</P>
<P>
In March, President Kim appointed Kim Jong-pil as acting prime
minister after the GNP, which holds the majority of seats in the
parliament, failed to vote over his formal appointment as prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
However, the GNP claimed it illegal that President Kim made Kim
Jong-pil as acting prime minister and asked the Constitutional
Court to made a judgement and issue an injunction against the
appointment.
</P>
<P>
The GNP has been opposing Kim Jong-pil, who formed an alliance
with Kim Dae-jung for winning the 15th presidential election last
December, as prime minister, arguing that Kim Jong-pil is not
qualified for the second highest post in the government which will
lead the nation to overcome the current financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The 72-year-old Kim Jong-pil, who is on his tour to Europe, has
been a heavyweight boxer in South Korea's political arena for
nearly 40 years and once took the post of prime minister of the
country. He was also the founder of the nation's Central
Intelligence Agency after helping late President Park Chung-hee
mastermind the 1961 coup.

<HEADLINE> Somali Shilling Gains Sharply Against US Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Somali Shalling appreciated
sharply Tuesday morning, with 7,500 Shillings to one U.S. Dollar,
compared to 8,400 Shillings to one U.S. Dollar Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The capital city of Mogadishu is floating with U.S. Dollars as
the Somali Shilling has made a dramatic increase in value against
the dollars.
</P>
<P>
Each one U.S. Dollar has lost more than 900 Shillings in just
less than 48 hours, the fastest appreciation the Shilling has
ever made against any of the hard currencies commonly used in
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts could not find a scientific reason to the
sharp increase in the value of the Shilling.
</P>
<P>
However, they characterized the immediate change as a
superficial overflow of the U.S. Dollars injected into the
economy.
</P>
<P>
The economists had supported their view with the stability of
the prices on all commodities including food and cosmetics which
should have collapsed in price with the dollars in the normal
economic recoveries.
</P>
<P>
According to the traders in Mogadishu's main Bakara market,
the exchange center has been washed with a lot of U.S. Dollars
since the faction leaders returned to the capital from their trip
to Libya Saturday.
</P>
<P>
An unconfirmed report and rumors said that the relatives of
the faction leaders are those who are especially pouring the
dollars in the market since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Another factor obviously affecting the market is a press
release issued Sunday by the faction leaders, stating that Libya
has already donated 250,000 U.S. Dollars for the establishment of
an administration in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The faction leaders also signed a draft agreement at a
luncheon sponsored by Libya's Ambassador to Somalia Al-Sayid
Ma'tuq for the faction leaders Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The four supreme leaders were made for the high council of
Mogadishu's administration, two co-chairmen (Ali Mahdi and
Hussein Aidid) and two deputy co-chairmen (Mohamed Qanyare and
Osman Atto).
</P>
<P>
They have also signed that Mogadishu's main installations, the
air and sea ports, will be opened on 18th this month, a pledge
hardly possible.
</P>
<P>
The optimistic mood thus resulted from their trip to Libya for
a possible political settlement for Mogadishu is also widely
voiced in the streets of the capital, another factor encouraging
the Somali Shilling to jump on its feet.
</P>
<P>
However, the pessimists assert that as usual, the faction
leaders will simply take the money and instead of using it for
the common good, they may turn it for the use against their
rivals within their factions.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Sam Rainsy Party Most Popular in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Among the three major political
parties in Cambodia, Sam Rainsy Party appears to be the most
popular one, at least in an opinion poll published Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The poll, by the French Institute for Statistics, Opinion Polls
and Research in Cambodia from July 8 through 11, shows that Sam
Rainsy Party enjoys support from 14.3 percent of the 3,398
respondents.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the support rate for the other two major political
parties, the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) and Funcinpec, stands
at 12.5 percent and 7.8 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Other 36 parties gather only marginal support among the
respondents -- 1,595 live in Phnom Penh and 1,803 in provinces.
</P>
<P>
And while the proportion of those who expressed no opinion
remains high at 39.3 percent, it is down significantly compared to
the 58.3 percent figure in the previous survey.
</P>
<P>
The decline, however, occurs only in Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
Among the respondents who expressed no opinion, about half
claim they have not made up their mind about which party they are
going to vote for, while the other half refuse to disclose their
political preference.
</P>
<P>
Only about 2 percent say they are not interested in politics.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Govt. Offers Amnesty to Surrendered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Sierra Leonean government has
offered amnesty to rebel soldiers committing atrocities in the
country and enjoined to surrender in the name of national
reconciliation, according to a report reaching here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Septumus Kaikai, spokesman for President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah,
was quoted as saying that rebels had been granted amnesty were
mostly the child soldiers conscripted into the army.
</P>
<P>
Kaikai said that this group of rebels whose ages fall between
nine and 10 did not join the army voluntarily. However, he added
that they had spent about six years in the civil war.
</P>
<P>
He accused the leaders of the rebels still loyal to the
Revolutionary United Front and the Armed Forces Revolutionary
Council of deliberately holding on to the youths who, he said,
were "given drugs which destabilize them."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman assured that this group of rebels still
committing atrocities in the eastern part of the country would be
granted amnesty if they surrendered to the Kabbah government.
</P>
<P>
But he ruled out a blanket amnesty for all rebels in the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The government was still "looking for the leaders of the
mayhem and the atrocity," Kaikai said.
</P>
<P>
Since the military government were chased out of the capital
Freetown in mid-February, rebels have been concentrated in the
eastern part of Kailan district, killing and maiming innocent
citizens for supporting the government of Kabbah.

<P>
GENEVA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has pledged to intensify its
cooperation with the Commonwealth by defending the trade and
development interests of "small states" within the global economy.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD will assist the small states through analytical support
and advice in negotiations for accession to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) and with regard to the provision of special and
differential treatment in the world trading system, UNCTAD Deputy
Secretary-General Carlos Fortin said when meeting a high-level
Commonwealth delegation here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth's definition of "small states" applies to 41
developing countries with a population not exceeding 1.5 million,
plus Papua New Guinea (4.3 million), Jamaica (2.5 million),
Lesotho (2.0 million) and Namibia (1.5 million).
</P>
<P>
The 45 of the 54 Commonwealth countries are all developing
countries and 14 of them belong to the United Nations' category of
Least Developed Countries.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD said that it will also contribute to the activities of a
joint task force of the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund, that will seek ways of dealing with the difficulty which
small developing states face in accessing funding for
development.

<HEADLINE> Passenger Services Continue to Improve at HK's New Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Within one week of opening, the
efficiency of passenger services at the new Hong Kong
International Airport have equaled, and in many respects
surpassed, those at Kai Tak, according to Hong Kong's Airport
Authority (AA).
</P>
<P>
More than 600,000 passengers have passed through the new
airport since the opening day on July 6 and the timeliness of
arriving and departing flights has improved steadily during the
week, the AA said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The number of those arriving early or on time has risen from 32
percent on July 7 to 58 percent by noon Monday.
</P>
<P>
By Monday 54 percent of flights had left on schedule, 96
percent within 30 minutes and all flights had left within an hour.
On July 7, only 15 percent of flights left within 30 minutes of
schedule.
</P>
<P>
The average delay for departures has gone from more than one
hour and 40 minutes on July 7 to just 12 minutes by Monday,
despite Monday morning's heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
There has also been a strong improvement in baggage handling,
with passengers now waiting from five to 20 minutes on average for
their bags after completing immigration formalities.
</P>
<P>
Airport Authority Corporate Development Director Clinton Leeks
said the figures showed that passenger services were now normal at
the new airport.
</P>
<P>
"While there continues to be room for improvement, we are
generally pleased that the passenger terminal is achieving the
levels of efficiency it was designed for and this view appears to
be supported by comments we are receiving from many passengers
themselves," Leeks said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, Federal Express Corporation (FedEx), the
world's largest air express transportation company, announced that
it has started operating five new weekly flights between Hong Kong
and the FedEx Asia Pacific Hub in Subic Bay, the Philippines, in
order to meet the increased demand for express services at its new
facilities at the Hong Kong International Airport.
</P>
<P>
"The successful start-up of our express facilities at the Asia
Airfreight Terminal since the opening day has substantially
enhanced our efficiency, enabling us to deliver faster and more
reliable service for customers in Hong Kong, and for shipments
from around the region and the world," said Michael Ducker,
president of FedEx Asia Pacific Division.

LAGOS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Tanker drivers in Lagos have warned
to embark on a strike if the state government could not guarantee

The threat followed Monday's clash between tanker drivers and

<P>
At least two persons were feared dead and several others
injured while three tankers were torched during the fracas, the

The conflict disrupted loading at the depot and would
consequently worsen the five-day-old fuel scarcity in the

SHANGHAI, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's retail sales volume
rose 9.6 percent on a year-on-year basis to 71.3 billion yuan
during the first half of this year, the city's statistics bureau
reports.
</P>
<P>
This was 2.6 percentage points higher than the national
average, and because the prices had a declining rate for the past
six years, the actual growth is more than 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
Video cameras, motorcycles and computers sold well, while
clothing sales dropped. Supermarket sales accounted for 41 percent
of the total while department stores accounted for only about 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that Shanghai's business is becoming very
competitive, but most companies' marketing strategy is restricted
to cutting prices and offering discounts.
</P>
<P>
Many companies are struggling along with next to zero
profits. Profits were down by 0.06 percentage points to 1.22
percent during the six-month period.
</P>

Shanghai expects to see retail sales increase by 11 percent to
147 billion yuan for the whole year.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Crimes Rise by 4.2 Percent in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's criminal cases
increased by 4.2 percent in 1997 over that of 1996, Tanzanian
Minister of Home Affairs Ali Ameir Mohammed has said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 528,710 criminal cases were reported in the
country, compared to 507,507 in 1996, the minister told
parliament in the central city of Dodoma Monday.
</P>
<P>
Of the cases, 512,832 were reported in the mainland while the
rest in the Zanzibar isles, Tuesday's Daily News quoted the
minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed, who is also a member of parliament for Donge, said
that in 1997 there were 2,355 murder cases in which 2,403 people
lost their lives.
</P>
<P>
The figure went down by 28 cases when compared to 2,383 murder
cases reported in 1996, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister also told the legislators that there were 885
incidents of armed robbery during 1997 with loss of property
worth 2.9 billion Shillings (about 4.3 million U.S. Dollars on
current basis).
</P>
<P>
However, he said, goods worth 485.9 million Shillings were
recovered and some 1,556 armed bandits were seized by the police.
</P>
<P>
The minister conceded that there is an increase of 21 percent
in armed robbery incidents.
</P>
<P>
He said a total of 82,539.5 kilograms of bhang were impounded
by the police in 3,747 incidents in 1997 as compared with 4,711
kilograms seized in 3,486 incidents in 1996. In addition, some
five kilograms of narcotic drugs were seized last year.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed said that the war on such drugs is an uphill task and
urged parliamentarians to lend their support.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Anti-drug Unit under the supervision of
Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye will be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Last year, some 269 arms and 1,256 rounds of ammunition were
netted, a 45.5 percent increase compared to 1995. Some 485
suspects were arrested for illegal possession of such arms, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
During the 1998/99 fiscal year, the Tanzanian government will
strive to strengthen patrols to control pirate activities,
Mohammed further said.
</P>
<P>
The police force will also train auxiliary police in public
and private institutions to tighten security in office buildings,
he noted.

bookstore-bars have recently opened in China's capital in response
to greater demand for different ways to use leisure time and
increased competition among bookstores.
</P>
<P>
Examples are the Shenghuo Dushu Xinzhi Joint Bookstore, the
Guolinfeng book center, the Beijing Concert Hall, and the Wansheng
Theatre.
</P>
<P>
Ladies' Bookstore, which is popular with many of Beijing's
women, also opened a bookstore-bar near the China Art Gallery in a
more than 100-square-meter space with unusual tables and chairs
and a good selection of drinks that are surrounded by bookshelves.
</P>
<P>
People tend to show up to enjoy looking at books while they
have a drink, and shows are also presented at the bar on weekends.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, customers can meet authors they admire and even have
a chat with them. Wang Guozhen, a well-known poet who often pays a
visit to bookstore-bars, praises the bars for offering people a
new choice. He says they even appeal to ordinary citizens.

<HEADLINE> Secret Autopsy Rules Out Poisoning of Abacha: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's former head of state
General Sani Abacha died of natural causes, according to the
tissue and blood samples taken from him shortly before he was
buried on June 8, This Day newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Abacha was announced died of heart attacked by the government
and was buried according to Muslim tradition with no postmortem
reported.
</P>
<P>
But This Day quoted sources conversant with the last moments
of late Abacha as saying that presidential doctors took some
blood, urine and tissue samples minutes after his death and flew
immediately to Germany for secret postmortem.
</P>
<P>
The result ruled out poisoning and foul play, the report said,
adding that there was no finding of Viagra (a new male potency
drug) used by the late leader as speculated by the United
States-based Newsweek magazine.
</P>
<P>
It has been widely spread that Abacha was in the company of
two ladies shortly before he died in the early hours of June 8.
</P>
<P>
The sudden death of Abacha has brought about a number of
changes in the most populous African country, which may finally
lead to a genuine transition from military to civil rule.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Willing to Discuss Regional Nuclear Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan High Commissioner to
India Ashraf Jehangir Qazi said Tuesday that his country was
willing to discuss with India at the Colombo summit of the South
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) on July 29-31 a
regional nuclear test ban pact formalizing the moratoria declared
by the two countries on further nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
In an interview to Press Trust of India (PTI) here, Qazi said
that Islamabad was keen to enter into a new hopeful and
constructive phase of relations with New Delhi when Pakistani
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif meets Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee on the fringes of the three-day Colombo summit.
</P>
<P>
SAARC, formed in 1985, embraces Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the
Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the two prime ministers would be of inherent
importance as this would be Sharif's first interaction with the
BJP-led coalition government in the aftermath of the nuclear
explosions, he said.
</P>
<P>
The relations between India and Pakistan have become more tense
following the nuclear tests by the two countries in May. The world
community has time and again urged the two countries to take
measures to ease tension through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"We have already indicated (to New Delhi) that peace and
security including confidence building measures as well as the
root cause of our tension, Jammu and Kashmir, are of primary and
urgent concern that should be addressed by the two sides," Qazi
said.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the question of signing the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty (CTBT), he said that Pakistan would keep all options open
including considering joining the treaty without India being a
party to it, indicating a clear shift in Pakistan's earlier stand.
</P>
<P>
Previously Pakistan maintained that it would sign the treaty
only after India signs it.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader Meets With Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, in a meeting with the President of the State of
Palestine Yasser Arafat today, said that the best way to resolve the
Mideast issue is negotiation based on UN resolutions and the
"Land for Peace" principle.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the Palestinian question is the key to the Mideast
issue and that China has always sympathized with and supported the
just cause of the Palestinian people, and is aware of the
complexity of the Mideast issue and the difficulty of finding a
solution.
</P>
<P>
However, China believes that as long as the Palestinian people
are united and stick to principles and flexible and pragmatic
tactics they will attain their lofty goal of regaining their lost
land and rights, and establishing an independent Palestinian
state, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He praised Arafat's contributions to the national liberation of
Palestine and said that Arafat has the support of the Palestinian
people and the respect of people all over the world with his
struggle over the past five decades and said that even ordinary
Chinese like villagers in remote areas know Arafat's name.
</P>
<P>
Li said that it is only when a statesman places the national
and the people's interests above anything else that he can win the
support of the people and a place in history.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said that the Chinese and Palestinians have a deep
friendship and leaders of the two countries have had constant
contacts, and that he is satisfied with the bilateral friendship
and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese have always stood by the Palestinian people
whenever Palestine was having difficulties and that the
Palestinians appreciate and value the Chinese people's assistance
and friendship, and said the Chinese are true friends of the
Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said that the Mideast peace process has suffered
setbacks and that Palestine finds itself in a very difficult
situation. Peace is its strategic choice, he said, and emphasized
that the Palestinian people will continue to forge ahead until
they regain all their legitimate rights.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Names New Chief of Naval Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Former Minister of Health Jubirla
Ayinla has been named Nigeria's new Chief of Naval Staff to
replace Okhai Mike Akhigbe, who was sworn last week as Chief of
General Staff.
</P>
<P>
Ayinla's appointment, which took immediate effect, was
announced in a statement Monday by David Attah, Chief Press
Secretary to Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalam Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
Ayinla was the Federal Minister of Health in the Federal
Executive Council (cabinet) which was dissolved last week. He
was Minister of Commerce and Tourism from July 1996 to November
1997.
</P>
<P>
Ayinla's predecessor Akhigbe was sworn as Chief of General
Staff last week by Abubakar to fill the vacuum created by the
fall of Oladipo Diya, who was arrested last December for
involvement in an alleged coup plot.
</P>
<P>
Also sworn in at the same time was Alami Dagash as the new
Chief of Defense Staff, a position held by Abubakar until he
succeeded late military leader General Sani Abacha on June 9.
</P>
<P>
In what looks like a major reshuffle of the armed forces, the
Army Command Monday announced the redeployment of some senior
commanders.
</P>
<P>
Victor Malu, former commander of the West African sub-regional
peacekeeping force in Liberia known as ECOMOG, was appointed the
commander of the Lagos Garrison, perhaps to strengthen the
security in the stronghold of Nigeria's opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
Before his new appointment, Malu was the general officer
commanding the Second Mechanized Division in the southwestern
City of Ibadan, a position once held by late General Abacha and
now taken over by Major-General Felix Mujakperuo.
</P>
<P>
Bashir Magashi was named the new commander of the Nigerian
Defense Academy, filling the vacuum left by Alami Dagash.
</P>
<P>
Leo Ajiborisha was appointed principal staff officer to the
new leader Abubakar.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Tries to Curb Dynamite Fishing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
planned to buy a marine patrol boat to add muscles to the
fight against rampant dynamite fishing.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Natural Resources and Tourism Zakia Meghji
revealed this at a parliamentary session on Monday in central
city of Dodoma.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the Daily News on Tuesday, Meghji
said that the Fisheries Department of the ministry has set aside
funds for purchasing the vessel, but she did not disclose its
cost.
</P>
<P>
The ministry, however, is unable to buy a vehicle for every
district for lack of funds, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Meghji appealed to the licensed miners not to
transfer explosives to the hands of illegal fishermen.
</P>
<P>
Although dynamite fishing is prohibited in the Indian Ocean
and all lakes of the country, criminal cases related to the
problem have been frequently reported.
</P>
<P>
Meghji said that the government will take measures to net and
prosecute all of the illegal fishermen.
</P>
<P>
During a crackdown on dynamite fishing between July and
November in 1997, the police and Tanzania People's Defense Forces
(TPDF) arrested 102 suspects and impounded seven tons of fish in
Dar es Salaam, Coast and Tanga regions along the Indian Ocean.
However, the crackdown campaign was weakened by the shortage of
modern facilities.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Tanzanian Vice-President Omar Ali Juma stressed the
need to review the existing laws and regulations
governing dynamite fishing.

<HEADLINE> HK, Macao, Guangdong Explore Ways to Develop Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong, Macao and Guangdong
are jointly exploring ways to further develop tourism on the
basis of their different social systems, natural resources unique
to each destination.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference at the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center here Tuesday, Amy Chan, executive director of
the Hong Kong Tourist Association, Lu Weixiong, director of the
Guangdong Provincial Tourism Bureau, and Suzete Saraiva, deputy
director of the Macao Government Tourist Office, outlined their
future objectives for joint cooperation in tourism.
</P>
<P>
Chan said that the tourism authorities and governments of
Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao all value this close relationship.
The Hong Kong-Guangdong Cooperation Joint Conference, proposed by
Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
Tung Chee Hwa, was set up in March this year to promote their
communications and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Starting from 1990, tourist communities of Hong Kong, Macao and
Guangdong held discussions on many occasions, exploring
possibilities of cooperation. In June 1993, representatives of the
three parties agreed to set up a working group to jointly promote
tourism.
</P>
<P>
In December that year, the Pearl River Delta Tourism Marketing
Organization was formally established with a view to attracting
more overseas visitors.
</P>
<P>
In the long term, she said, this is a significant task as the
results of study will not only enhance the attractiveness of this
region for overseas tourists, but also provide a basis for a
balanced approach to improving tourism infrastructure and
developing new scenic spots and tourism products in the region.
</P>
<P>
Lu said: "To further promote tourism in all three areas, we
will endeavor to implement measures that will make travel even
more convenient."
</P>
<P>
"We will also assess how to best enhance the flow of
information between the three destinations, and increase
cooperation in human resources training to heighten the tourism
competitiveness," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, the Organization announced the
completion of the "Pearl River Delta Hotel Inventory 1997" which
comprises a comprehensive listing of hotels in Guangdong, Hong
Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
Saraiva noted that this is the first of the inventory projects
jointly conducted by the three members of the Organization.

<HEADLINE> Moscow to Invite Japanese Premier in Fall as Scheduled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko said Tuesday that Moscow will invite Japan's next prime
minister to visit Moscow this fall as scheduled for a summit with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Japan have confirmed that the basis of friendly
bilateral relations has not changed despite political changes in
Japan, Kiriyenko told a news conference at the Japan National
Press Club.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto announced his
resignation on Monday to take responsibility for the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party's major setback in Sunday's House of
Councillors election.
</P>
<P>
The LDP is to chose a new president by July 21, and that person
will become the next Japanese prime minister as the party holds a
majority in the powerful House of Representatives (lower house).
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto had planned to make an official visit to Russia in
October.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin has pledged to give an answer
to Hashimoto's proposal, made at their informal summit at the
Japanese resort town of Kawana in April, to resolve a territorial
dispute between their countries when the Japanese premier visits
Moscow this fall.
</P>
<P>
The territorial dispute over a group of islands has prevented
the two countries from concluding a peace treaty since the former
Soviet Union seized the islands at the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko said he was satisfied with his trip to Japan and cited
Japan's agreement to cooperate in the development of energy in the
Russian Far East as one of the fruits of the visit.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko, winding up his two-day visit to Japan, has left for
Beijing for a working visit.

CANBERRA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Australia and France signed an
agreement here Tuesday, which allows their citizens to travel to
each other's territories without visas for visits of up to three
months.
</P>
<P>
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, who signed the
agreement with Dominique Girard, French ambassador to Australia,
said the streamlined access would benefit some 200,000 Australians
who visited France and its overseas territories of New Caledonia
and French Polynesia on holidays or business each year.
</P>
<P>
"This means that Australians can now travel to European Union
countries without the need for a visa (for visits of up to three
months)," Downer said.
</P>
<P>
He said there had been strong growth in the number of French
tourist and business visitors to Australia in the past two years,
and the new arrangements should serve to maintain this pleasing
trend.
</P>
<P>
The announcement confirmed the often rocky relationship between
Australia and France had now fully recovered from the disastrous
low of 1995 when French nuclear testing led to an almost complete

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Borrow to Recapitalize Local Banks: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia would borrow and use
local funds for the 16 billion ringgit (3.773 billion U.S.
dollars) needed to recapitalize local banks, Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have quite a lot of savings, for example the Employees'
Provident Fund with monthly contributions of 1.2 billion ringgit
(283 million U.S. dollars)," he told reporters after opening the
Universiti Kebangsaan (National University) Malaysia (UKM)
Hospital in Bandar Tun Razak, Cheras, near here.
</P>
<P>
He said part of the borrowings would be raised through bond
issues, some internationally while the rest domestically.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Monday 16 billion
ringgit (3.773 billion U.S. dollars) is required for the banking
system for 1998 and 1999 in order to maintain the risk-weighted
capital ratio at 9.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also said his government may find other ways of
reducing interest rates without touching the base lending rate
(BLR). The government can reduce the BLR but if it does so, some
foreign companies might increase their interest rates, causing an
outflow of funds from Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
He said another setback would be the possibility of currency
traders to further devalue ringgit as they might decide "this is
bad."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that the government hoped to further reduce the
BLR in the near future.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) established here Tuesday a foundation to promote
and strengthen people to people contact.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to have an institution that will promote people to
people contact. What we would not like to see is for ASEAN to
develop as an inter-governmental organization only," Indonesian
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said after the establishment ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"Through the foundation, we hope to energize a lot of projects.
Of the ASEAN Foundation, much can be expected and a great deal
will be demanded," he said, adding that the foundation will
promote human resources development, education, skills training,
health care and culture.
</P>
<P>
The organization will offer fellowships and establish an
exchange program for ASEAN youths, scientists and professionals,
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
It will also take initiatives to address urgent regional
concerns, including efforts to alleviate poverty, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile ASEAN Secretary General Rodolfo C. Severino said the
foundation could promote ASEAN awareness as well as social
cohesiveness.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the current economic crisis, Severino said that
a crucial task of the foundation is to help restore international
confidence in ASEAN economies.
</P>
<P>
The idea of setting up the foundation was first brought up
during the 1st ASEAN Informal Summit Meeting held in Jakarta in
December 1996.
</P>
<P>
At the second ASEAN Informal Summit Meeting in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia, in 1997, a memorandum of understanding on the
establishment of the foundation was signed by the ASEAN foreign
ministers.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Mediates Ethio-Eritrean Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has decided to meet Eritrean President Isaias Afewerki in
Nairobi later this week following his three-hour talks with
Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi Monday.
</P>
<P>
"President Moi will meet Mr. Afewerki sometime this week,"
a Kenyan Foreign Ministry official told Xinhua Tuesday. Moi's move
was seen the latest of a series of international mediation efforts
since border clashes erupted between Ethiopia and Eritrea on May 6.
</P>
<P>
"They will just consult with each other to find a solution,"
said the official who declined to tell his name.
</P>
<P>
Tensions escalated in early June when Ethiopia and Eritrea
bombed each other and battles raged for a brief period on three
fronts. Hundreds were killed before fighting gave way to a
stalemate on the border where thousands of troops have been
massed on each side.
</P>
<P>
In June, Eritrea rejected a proposal by the U.S. and Rwanda to
end the fighting. Further attempts by African heads of state
from Burkina Faso, Zimbabwe and Djibouti also made little
headway.
</P>
<P>
After talks with Zenawi who paid one-day visit to Nairobi, Moi
said that their discussions on the conflict "was not a new
initiative" but "would lend weight to the ongoing initiatives by
the OAU (Organization of African Unity) and other parties."
</P>
<P>
"It was proper and prudent (for Kenya) to take the territorial
dispute seriously since Ethiopia is Kenya's neighbor and a member
of Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD)," Moi said
in a statement issued after the talks.
</P>
<P>
Moi now chairs IGAD, which groups Kenya, Eritrea, Somalia,
Sudan, Uganda and Djibouti. The body was set up to help resolve
problems among member states in the Horn of Africa and east
Africa.

<HEADLINE> EU Troika Delegation to Resume Dialog With Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced Tuesday that the
European Union (EU) is to resume its "critical dialog" with Iran
Saturday to pave the way for improving the strained EU-Iran
relations.
</P>
<P>
Ali Ahani, director general for Western European affairs at
the Iranian Foreign Ministry, said that the EU Troika delegation
comprising Austrian, British and German officials would arrive
here Friday and start the first round of talks Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ahani was quoted by the official news agency IRNA as saying
that the main topics of the talks would be the EU-Iran cultural
cooperation as well as the relation between the EU and the
Organization of the Islamic Conference.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the three-day visit, the EU Troika
delegation would also discuss with Iranian officials the latest
developments in Afghanistan, Iraq, Central Asia and the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
The EU visit was originally scheduled in June, but delayed due
to the differences over the delegation's level and the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Ahani expressed the hope that the talks would result in
positive and constructive developments in Iran-EU relations.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials said earlier that Iran expected the EU to
send a high-level delegation to start a "constructive dialog" to
replace the "critical dialog," which was launched by the EU in
December 1992 in a bid to milden Iran's policies on the Middle
East peace process, terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The EU suspended the "critical dialog" in April last year after
a Berlin court ruling accused top Iranian officials of sponsoring
terrorist activities against Iranian dissidents in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Ending the diplomatic row over the Berlin court issue, the EU
decided in last March to resume ministerial contacts and the
"critical dialog" with Iran.
</P>
<P>
To pave the way for improving the EU-Iran relations, Italian
Prime Minister Romano Prodi paid an official visit to Iran early
this month.

LUOYANG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- A seminar on three Chinese
philsophers who had a great influence on Chinese thought has been
held in Luoyang, a historical city in central China's Henan
Province.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 scholars from China and the Republic of Korea
attended the two-day seminar and presented 29 papers on the
thought of Cheng Hao, Cheng Yi and Zhu Xi, representatives of the
Neo-Confucian school of thought in the Northern Song Dynasty
(960-1127).

The scholars say that the thinkers had the greatest influence
in feudal times after Confucius and Mencius. They held that all
things in the universe were determined by "reason", which had
existed before all things.
</P>
<P>
Some of the scholars say they will work to apply Zhu Xi's

<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Agency for
International Development (AusAID) and the Chinese Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) launched the 20
million Australian dollar Capacity Building Program here today to
cooperate in strengthening selected Chinese public sectors.
</P>
<P>
The largest project funded so far under the technical
cooperation program between AusAID and MOFTEC, the Capacity
Building Program will support Chinese policy-making and program
implementation in key areas relating to the transition to a market
economy.
</P>
<P>
This is to be achieved through the transfer and adaptation of
leading-edge Australian systems and expertise, particularly in
sectors such as banking, finance, taxation, social security and
insurance, and urban planning and development.
</P>
<P>
Australian Ambassador to China Richard Campbell Smith
officiated the launching of the program, and said it "will
undoubtedly build a sense of partnership" between Australia and
China. He also noted its timeliness as China meets the challenges
of state-owned enterprise reforms and the Asian financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Discord on Pricing Delays W. African Gas Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The implementation of the
260-million-U.S.-Dollar west African gas pipeline project is
being delayed over the inability of the promoters to reach
agreement with gas suppliers on pricing.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, Ghana, Togo and Benin are jointly promoting the
project, while two of the world's leading oil companies, Shell
and Chevron, are poised to supply the pipeline system with
natural gas from the oil fields they operate in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The project has been seen as a major joint venture to promote
sub-regional cooperation in the economic field, as the pipeline
is expected to extend to cover the whole of west Africa in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Officials were already looking at an October date for the
start-up of the project after the completion of survey of gas
markets in Ghana, Togo and Benin by the West African Gas Pipeline
Company.
</P>
<P>
The major problem now is reaching agreement on the right price
at which the gas is to be delivered to these countries, the
Lagos-based Daily Times newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted company sources as saying that both Shell
and Chevron could raise the 260 million U.S. Dollars to fund the
project and that the firms must get agreement to sell the gas at
profitable rate.
</P>
<P>
But as the project suffers delay, more stumbling blocks lay
ahead as Ghana which is the prime mover of the project is
considering alternative sources to boost its electricity
generation.
</P>
<P>
To generate electricity is the major reason of Ghana for
promoting the sub-regional gas project.
</P>
<P>
The country has been carrying out an electricity rationing
program since the beginning of this year due to lack of electric
power supply.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Ghana has contracted Japanese and
American firms to supply very large gas storage vessel which
would be used to general electricity.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Ghana at the weekend settled its rift
with Burkina Faso over cut in water flow from the Volta River
which affected operations at Ghana's Akosombo Hydroelectric Power
Station.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed an agreement to work together to use
the resources of the Volta River.

items in leading Turkish newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Yeni Yuzyil (New Century):
</P>
<P>
-- At a press conference in the parliament Monday, Turkish
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit suggested that the general
elections be held in November in order to create a stable
political environment as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and opposition Republican People's
Party Chairman Deniz Baykal agreed last month that the current
coalition government would resign at the end of this year and a
new "election government" would bring the country to early
elections next April.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel, who country is
currently holding the European Union (EU) rotating presidency,
said in Brussels Monday that the EU would make great efforts to
normalize its ties with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish-EU relations have remained tense since last
December when Ankara was excluded from the EU's enlargement
process at the EU summit in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
Aksam (Evening):
</P>
<P>
-- Yilmaz said Monday that his government was determined to
bring down the soaring inflation rate, but stressed that "this
needs time."
</P>
<P>
Turkey's inflation rate, which stood at 80 percent at the end

development.
</P>

Glafcos Clerides, who was in Moscow on an official visit,

Turkish has vowed to take all necessary steps to prevent the
missiles from entering the divided island, saying the missile
deployment would constitute a direct threat to Turkey's state
security. The anti-aircraft Russian missiles are due to be
delivered next month.

<HEADLINE> Merrill Lynch Plans to Expand China Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Merrill Lynch of the United States
will significantly expand its business in China, according to
David Komansky, the company chairman.
</P>
<P>
"Merrill Lynch will continue to be a partner with China in
countless ways, as a link to the capital markets worldwide, as an
advisor to government and private enterprises, and even one day to
Chinese families and individuals who will face the same crucial
financial decisions as their counterparts all over the globe,"
Komansky said at a ceremony here marking his receiving of the
Marco Polo Prize, which is granted by the China Project of the
Volunteers of America.
</P>
<P>
Komansky also urged China to open its financial sector wider to
pave the way for greater involvement of overseas investment banks
in China's capital market.
</P>
<P>
"Like every great nation, China has the daunting economic
challenge of providing financial security for a growing elderly
population. And Merrill Lynch can be an enormous assistant giving
people the tools to save and invest to become more self-sufficient
and less dependent on their government for their economic
well-being," the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
"This, of course, requires government action to encourage
companies like Merrill Lynch to become more involved in the
domestic service system, and it also requires the further
development of the regulatory structure to protect the individual
investors as well as the provider of the financial services," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Komansky also said that he is fully confident about China's
ability to overcome the effects of the Asian financial crisis and
to push forward domestic financial reforms.
</P>
<P>
The first United States securities firm to open representative
offices in China, Merrill Lynch has so far underwritten Chinese
shares and bonds valued at eight billion U.S. dollars, the largest
business volume in China among all overseas investment banks.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Merrill Lynch manages 13 trillion US dollars in
customer assets.
</P>

The Marco Polo Prize is awarded to individuals and collectives
that have rendered active support to the China Project of the
Volunteers of America.

<HEADLINE> 1,347 People Removed From Voter List in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's National Election
Committee has decided to remove 1,347 more people from the voter
list for reasons mainly of nationality.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced at the committee's daily press
briefing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Among those removed from the 5.4-million voter list, 1,298 were
from Phnom Penh who were all without proper documents to identify
their Cambodian nationality. The others, who were from Kandal and
Battambang provinces were deleted from the list because of death
and multiple registration.
</P>
<P>
The committee has so far removed nearly 2,000 people from the
voter list. Early last week 53 Vietnamese were removed from the
list and later on Saturday 393 others were struck out for reasons
including multiple registration.
</P>
<P>
Though the National Election Committee has been criticized for
some of its members' connection with the Cambodia People's Party,
the Coalition for Free and Fair Elections said Sunday the move
could be a sign that the committee may be serious about
eliminating election fraud.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Trade Deficit Shrinks in First Half of '98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Israel's trade deficit declined
by 22 percent in the first half of this year compared to the same
period last year, the Israeli Haaretz daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the Central Bureau of Statistics as saying
that the trade deficit stood at 3.4 billion U.S. dollars during
the first six months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The bureau attributed the deficit decline to the improved trade
balances with the United States and the European Union (EU),
Israel's two major trading partners.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit with the U.S. fell by a whopping 44 percent,
while that with the EU dropped by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the gains were partially offset by a 45 percent increase in
the trade deficit with Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The improved overall trade balance was largely caused by a 9 to
10 percent increase in total exports in the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Exports, rising by 700 million dollars, stood at 8.4 billion
dollars. About half of the increase derived from exports to the
EU, which totaled 3.1 billion dollars; another 38 percent
consisted of exports to the U.S., which totaled 2.3 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Exports to Asia, in contrast, fell about 12 percent to 889
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Imports plunged by 2 percent in the first half of 1998 to 11.8
billion dollars. The imports from the U.S. and Europe decreased by
1.6 percent and 3.5 percent respectively, while the imports from
Asia rose by 3.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Asia Is Most Important Trade Partner Of Eastern Chinese Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Even during the Asian financial
crisis east China's Shandong Province, which is close to the Republic
of Korea and Japan, still considered Asian countries its most
important trade partners.
</P>
<P>
Du Shicheng, vice-governor of the province, points to these
geographic advantages for trade relations and says the province
has gained a lot from them in the past, and the province is paying
a great deal of attention to protecting foreign-funded firms from
these countries.
</P>
<P>
An automobile project backed by Daewoo with 5.7 billion yuan,
for example, has begun construction after several months of
delays, with the help of the Chinese partners.
</P>
<P>
The province had a drop in exports and foreign investment, but
recent statistics show an export increase in the province of 0.1
percent in the first five months, and Du predicts that the
situation will get better in the second half, and points out that
the fourth quarter is the province's peak period for exports.
</P>
<P>
He says though that the province has to wait and see whether
the Japanese yen is depreciated, because foreign trade could be
hit severely.
</P>
<P>
Also, the province's foreign trade structure has to be changed
because it depends too heavily on the Asian market, with 27 percent
of its exports going to Japan and 23 percent to ROK, and it
exports too many raw materials and farm products, and too few
high-tech goods.
</P>
<P>
So the province has been trying to enter the European and
American markets and is providing subsidies for exports and
encouraging firms to improve technology to make their products
more competitive. It has also set up six teams to help
export-oriented firms do business overseas.
</P>
<P>
These efforts seem to be paying off. In the January-May period,
exports Europe and the United States were up 50 percent.

the slopes of Mount Merapi, from full alert to high alert, the
most active volcano spewed lava and hot ashes four times early
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The spewing occurred from 00:00 to 6:00 a.m. Monday, Antara
News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The lava and toxic gases were flowing down westward about 3,000
meters from the crater to Lamat river, the report quoted a local
official as saying later Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mas Atje Purbawinata, head of the Yogyakarta volcanology
office, said Merapi's hot ashes would continue to threaten the
western slope of the volcano as lava and hot ashes were still
flowing down westward.
</P>
<P>
Seven villages in the western area of the volcano have been
considered as danger areas, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, no evacuation of the tens of thousands of residents
within an 11-kilometer radius that could be affected if the
situation continues to deteriorate, has been ordered.
</P>
<P>
The decision is up to the local government authorities, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
"But they have set up emergency command posts, and I have seen
them," he added.
</P>
<P>
Merapi, which overlooks the densely-populated southern plain of
Central Java, erupted last Saturday, with explosions that could be
heard as far as 20 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Lava spills flowed into river beds at the foot of the mountain
and some villages were reported to be under 1.5 meters of ash,
which also blanketed crops and plantations.
</P>
<P>
Merapi, 2,968-meter high, last erupted in 1994, killing more
than 60 people and forcing more than 6,000 others to evacuate to
safer grounds.
</P>
<P>
Merapi is one the 127 active volcanoes in Indonesia, a country
which lies along the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire.

<P>
TOKYO, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed higher for the
second straight day in Tokyo Tuesday due to a last-minute buying
of bank and steel shares after fluctuating throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
But the key Nikkei index found little room to grow
significantly under the weight of selling pressure by institutions
and hesitance among investors to move until a successor is found
for Japanese Prime Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose 128.52
points, or 0.79 percent, from Monday's close to end at 16,488.91.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, gained 10.21 points or 0.31 percent to
1,266.65.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section came to an estimated 400 million
shares, up slightly from 389.08 million shares Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nippon Steel was Tuesday's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Analysts anticipate a dull market throughout the week following
Hashimoto's announcement Monday of his resignation to take the
blame for his Liberal Democratic Party's major setback in Sunday's
House of Councillors election.
</P>
<P>
The LDP is to chose a new president July 21, and that person
will become the next prime minister because of the party's
majority in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Investors are also still waiting for details about the size and
timing of next year's permanent income tax cuts, promised by
outgoing Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to stimulate domestic
consumption.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,332 issues listed on the First Section, gainers
surpassed losers 747 to 378, with 146 issues remaining unchanged.

</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto resigned on Monday
after a crashing defeat suffered by his Liberal Democratic Party
in the election of the Senate. The incumbent foreign minister,
Keizo Obuchi, who is the main designer for improved relations with
Russia, is among the favorites to succeed Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
-- More than 600,000 people hailed the French football team who
came down on a bus on the Champs-Elysee Monday afternoon. After
one night of folly, France was living the euphoria as the
conqueror of the world football championship.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- July 12, the day when France won the World Cup, made up a
festival of national unity re-discovered. Suddenly, the crowd felt
themselves to be French. Our country has a soul, and perhaps it is
this singularity which expresses July 14, the French specialty.
</P>
<P>
L'Humanite:
</P>
<P>
-- Thank you football. With millions of voices, excited and
cheerful, France affirms itself as that of Kabylian Zidane,
Ariegeois Barthez, Guadeloupean Thuram, and Ghanaian Desailly. One
should think that Le Pen, who does not like these footballers, was
the biggest loser of the World Cup.

<HEADLINE> China Amending Copyright Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- China is now amending its
seven-year-old copyright law in order to enhance copyright
protection and better align itself with international conventions.
</P>
<P>
A State Press and Publications Administration official today
told Xinhua that the amended copyright law will bridge the gap
between China's current copyright law and international
conventions, as well as tackle problems which appeared after the
issuance of the current copyright law in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The ammeded copyright law will also strengthen the protection
of new technologies such as databases and multimedia products, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Since it went into effect seven years ago," the official said,
"the current copyright law has played a significant role in
China's copyright protection, but due to a lack of experience, it
has some problems such as dual-standards for Chinese and
foreigners."
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the new law is demanded by
technological development. "Legal issues caused by new computer
technology and the Internet have caused wide concern among
legislators," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the amended draft of the copyright law is
expected to be submitted to the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress by the end of this year.

BANGKOK, July 14 (Xinhua) -- A total of 593 Thais were arrested

Those detained included both gamblers and bookmakers, said an

Meanwhile, a survey by a major research group found spending by
Bangkok residents on eating out, entertainment and transport was
slashed as Thais stayed home to watch the games, which were
screened late at night because of the time difference with France.
</P>
<P>
Spending on newspapers increased dramatically as Thais sought
out the blanket coverage given to the World Cup, rising 26.03
percent to an average of 92 baht a week,
</P>
<P>
Another positive effect of the tournament was that traffic flow
had markedly improved, the survey noted, adding spending on

<HEADLINE> Scientists: Western Diet Linked to Colon Cancer Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Western diets rich in meat and
low in fruits may increase the risk of colon cancer, American
scientists warned in a study released Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The dietary pattern associated with the greatest increase in
risk is the one which typifies a Western-style diet," Dr. Martha
Slattery of the University of Utah Medical Center wrote in the
latest issue of the American Journal of Epidemiology.
</P>
<P>
Slattery and his colleagues used detailed questionnaires to
ascertain the long-term eating patterns of nearly 4,400 American
adults. Half of them were colon cancer patients and the other half
were healthy "Controls."
</P>
<P>
The researchers found that men and women who ate a "Western"
diet -- high in red and processed meats, refined grains and
sugars, and low in fresh fruits and vegetables -- doubled their
overall risk for colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
This type of diet was also strongly associated with higher
daily cholesterol and energy intake, weight gain, and obesity.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, those who ate a "prudent" diet -- low in red meat
and sugars but high in fish, poultry, fresh fruits and vegetables
-- achieved a nearly 40 percent reduction in their colon cancer
risk.
</P>
<P>
These individuals also exercised more and had an average lower
body weight than those on more "Western" diets.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Typhoid Fever Kills 8 in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Department of Health Tuesday
confirmed the typhoid fever outbreak in the central Philippine
town of Samar which killed eight people recently.
</P>
<P>
Lilia Arteche, Eastern Visayas health regional director, said
the outbreak of typhoid fever was reportedly caused by
contamination of a brook transversing three hinterland villages.
</P>
<P>
The contamination of the said stream, the only source of water
in the villages, could be attributed to the long summer months due
to the El Nino phenomenon aside from the possibility that some
residents may have defecated in it, Arteche said.
</P>
<P>
She said that the outbreak has been placed under control with
cases starting to decrease as continuous monitoring of illnesses
is being conducted by the regional health office.
</P>
<P>
Medicines were also sent to the villages, Arteche said.
</P>
<P>
Typhoid fever is caused by ingestion of food and water
contaminated with human waste.
</P>
<P>
Among the signs and symptoms are sustained high fever,
headache, weakness, loss of appetite, diarrhea or constipation and
abdominal discomfort.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Enact Chemical Weapons Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
soon enact a convention that prohibits the development,
production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons, local press
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The convention will be ratified following an agreement between
all four factions at the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
At a House plenary meeting here Monday, all factions said the
government will enact the convention "to maintain world peace".
</P>
<P>
The discussion of the enactment of the convention commenced on
June 29 when Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Alatas proposed that
Indonesia join global efforts to ban chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has signed the convention on chemical weapons on
January 13, 1993.
</P>
<P>
Alatas told the House Monday that the convention on chemical
weapons essentially aims to protect humans from the threat of
chemical warfare.
</P>
<P>
The convention is not the final goal, but is an instrument that
can be used to achieve the honorable goal of protecting all
mankind, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that after the convention is enacted by the
president, the government will submit the document to United
Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
He was quick to reassure the House that passing the convention
would not hurt the country's industries that produce or import
various chemicals.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia will not meet any obstacles in the trade of chemical
materials needed to develop the national economy," he added.

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns Israeli Air Raids on South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman
Mahmoud Mohammadi Tuesday condemned the Israeli air raids on
residential quarters in south Lebanon Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said the Israeli attacks violated all international
conventions and were also evidence of "the terrorist substance" of
the Jewish state, the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Two Irish members of the U.N. peacekeepers and a Lebanese
civilian were wounded when an Israeli warplane fired two missiles
Monday at the Hataida village, a stronghold of the Iranian-backed
Shiite Muslim guerrilla group Hezbollah (Party of God) in the
central sector of the Israeli-occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
Under the ceasefire agreement signed between Israel and the
Hezbollah in April 1996 after the Israeli Operation Grapes of
Wrath, both sides agreed to avoid attacking civilian targets or
using civilian cover in carrying out military operations.
</P>
<P>
Since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, Iran has been supporting
the Lebanese resistance groups, especially the Hezbollah, in their
fight to oust the Israeli occupation troops.
</P>
<P>
Israel has carved out a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip in
south Lebanon since 1985 with the claimed aim to protect its
northern areas from guerrilla cross-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> Expert Raises New View of Sustainable Financial Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- A new view of sustainable
financial development raised by Professor Bai Qinxian has evoked
wide discussion in China's financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Bai Qinxian, director of the International Financial Institute
attached to Liaoning University, published his financial views in
early June and they were met with an immediate response in the
print media and at seminars.
</P>
<P>
According to Bai, sustainable financial development refers to
the establishment and perfection of the financial system, the
development of its mechanisms and the improvement of financial
efficiency while following the inherent law of financial
development, so that these resources can be distributed in an
efficient way while the economy maintains healthy development.
</P>
<P>
Bai pointed out that the world's economy and finance are
becoming increasingly global, with finance playing a growing role
in this new worldwide economy.
</P>
<P>
"Finance has extreme strategic importance in the stability of
China's and the world's economic and social development. "Finance
is one of a country's most precious strategic resources, which
should be appropriately tapped for sustainable long-term
development," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that sustainable economic development can not do
without sustainable financial development, and suggested that the
government include sustainable financial development in China's
"21st Century Agenda."

<TEXT>
<P>
Many financial experts called Bai's viewpoint a breakthrough
beyond the traditional theoretical system, and said they believe
it will enable people to gain a new understanding of the core
function of modern finance in resource distribution and social and
economic operations. They may also reconsider the importance of
financial safety and financial sovereignty to a nation's safety
and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Experts also pointed out that although the idea of sustainable
financial development has yet to be fully implemented, it can help
solve the problems of financial crises, development and
supervision.
</P>
<P>
Since the Southeast Asian financial crisis erupted in mid-1997,
China's scholars have stepped up their examinations of finance in
an effort to find a financial operating model suited to China's
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government also stepped up its financial reform
this year, giving full play to financial levers on macroeconomic
control while trying to prevent financial risks.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics released by the People's Bank of China,
the central bank, show that the financial sector operated smoothly
in the first half of this year, with the RMB yuan remaining
stable.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaitis With Dual Nationality May Lose Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 14 (Xinhua) -- About 18,500 Kuwaiti citizens
may soon lose the government housing for holding a second
nationality, local English daily Arab Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A recommendation for withdrawing houses from such citizens was
recently adopted by top government authorities, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Nationality Law, enacted in 1959, stipulates that "Kuwaiti
citizens shall not hold the citizenship of any other country."
</P>
<P>
The Public Authority for Housing Care has begun studying files
of citizens who are enjoying government housing despite their
dual nationality.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance has also begun circulating a
confidential letter to state ministries and institutions to ask
for detailed reports on such citizens.
</P>
<P>
The government took the actions after it received complaints
that these citizens live mostly abroad but return to Kuwait every
six months to benefit from state-rendered privileges, such as
monthly salaries and free medical service.
</P>
<P>
These citizens also lease their homes to others while many
Kuwaiti families are anxiously waiting for government housing,
according to the charges.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti government is now serious about instituting legal
proceedings against citizens who abuse Kuwaiti nationality by
using it merely as a source of financial gains and housing
benefits, the paper added.

<P>
DHAKA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- No foreign banks will be allowed to
open business in Bangladesh in the near future, said the country's
central bank, Bangladesh Bank.
</P>
<P>
But foreign banks would get permission to set up leasing
businesses in the country, Lutfar Rahman Sarkar, governor of
Bangladesh Bank, was quoted as saying by The Financial Express
daily Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Applications for opening businesses by three foreign banks were
pending, and they were unlikely to be considered soon, according
to bank sources, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
There are about 40 banks operating in Bangladesh, including 13
foreign banks which account for over 6 percent of the business in
the country's banking sector.
</P>
<P>
Local banks, particularly national commercial banks in
Bangladesh, are facing fierce competition from their foreign
counterparts both in terms of business and services.
</P>
<P>
Foreign banks are in a better position in terms of efficient
management, technological development, network support, proper
accountability and independent lending.
</P>
<P>
It takes little time for them to adapt to advanced banking
operations and then provide better services, but local banks, slow
to respond to new technological innovations, are not even able to
introduce ATM, credit card and instant fund transfer, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Defends Right to Seize Illegal Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has asserted its right
to seize any vessel that enters its territorial waters without
permission, the Arab Times daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber
Al-Sabah was quoted as saying Monday that his country was ready to
detain ships that violate the U.N. sanctions on Iraq by entering
Kuwait's waters.
</P>
<P>
Sabah was commenting on the seizure of two foreign ships
recently by the Kuwaiti Coast Guard, the English-language daily
said.
</P>
<P>
The two dhows, which were registered in India and the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) respectively, were sailing from Iraq to the
UAE carrying a cargo of dates and sheep skin.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council has imposed trade embargo on Iraq
since 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Nouri Saad, assistant director of Kuwait Port Authority, said
Kuwait has the legal right to confiscate and sell the cargo, and
have the vessels sold.
</P>
<P>
The proceeds would be used to cover the penalty fees, customs
fees and costs of towing the vessels into port, he added.
</P>
<P>
Saad said the 15 Indian crew on board have been questioned and
are kept at the port of Doha near Kuwait City.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Kuwait has seized six vessels so far this
year, but none of them has been sold due to the complicated
process of selling such vessels.

<P>
COLOMBO, July 14 (Xinhua) -- A proprietary gem miner in Sri
Lanka's gem-mining district of Ratnapura last week found a
precious 880-carat blue sapphire the size of an egg, according
local newspaper reports Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Its value is yet to be estimated but Gem Authority officials
said it is worth at least 800,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka is known as an "island of gems" and historical
evidence shows that gems were an important product for trade
during early times.
</P>
<P>
Ratnapura or city of gems, more than 100 kilometers from
Colombo, has been the center for the country's gem industry for
many years.
</P>
<P>
The recipient of the gem, Leela Dharmadasa, Monday evening
showed the stone to President Chandrika Kumaratunga at her
official residence, saying the stone will assist her in making a
fortune and hoping this will be the start of a new era where more
stones of this weight, quality and magnitude would be found.
</P>
<P>
In previous instances where valuable gems were found they were
sold in the black market owning to the prevailing tariff system.
Gem miners now have the opportunity to sell their valuable gems at
auction.

BELGRADE, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Republic of Montenegro in
Yugoslavia Monday staged rallies to mark the 57th anniversary of
the armed uprising against fascist invaders.
</P>
<P>
Montenegro President Milo Djukanovic, military leaders such as
Ladoslav Martinovic and Milan Zec and World War II veterans joined
the rally held at Virpazar meeting center and laid wreaths at
the martyrs' tomb.
</P>
<P>
Veljko Zoric, a veteran of the war, said at the rally that the
people of Montenegro showed their courage and unyielding spirit in
the fight against fascist forces in Europe.
</P>
<P>
On the current situation in Yugoslavia, Zoric said that Kosovo
is an inseparable part of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo issue was related to the national security of
Yugoslavia and had to be solved through democratic means, he said.
</P>
<P>
On July 13, 1941, the people of Montenegro, under the
leadership of the Yugoslav Communist party, launched a large-scale
armed uprising. The struggle was finally won four years later at

<HEADLINE> UN Security Council Condemns Massacres in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of the
United Nations issued a presidential statement on Monday
condemning massacres and other atrocities and violations of
international humanitarian law in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the council reviewed a recent report of the
UN Secretary General's aborted human rights investigation team in
the country. The report concludes that the killing by the Alliance
of Democratic Force for the Liberation of the Congo constituted
crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
The report finds possible evidence of genocide, noting that
attacks on camps in north Kivu in 1996 "reveal the intent to
eliminate those Rwandan Hutus who had remained in former Zaire."
</P>
<P>
The UN Secretary General Kofi Annan withdrew the team in April
because of a total lack of cooperation from the government of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo. The team had gone in with a
mandate to investigate violations of human rights and
international humanitarian law, which were alleged to have been
committed in the country up to December 31, 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the council recognized the necessity to
further investigate the massacres, other atrocities and violations
of international humanitarian law and to prosecute those
responsible.
</P>
<P>
The council called on the governments of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo and Rwanda to investigate without delay, in
their respective countries, allegations contained in the report of
the investigation team and to bring to justice any persons found
to have been involved in the massacres, atrocities and violations
of international humanitarian law.
</P>
<P>
The council encouraged the governments of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo and Rwanda to seek international assistance,
such as technical assistance, in this process.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council expressed its readiness to consider, as
necessary in light of actions by the governments of the two
countries, additional steps to ensure that perpetrators of the
massacres, other atrocities and violations of international
humanitarian law were brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
It expressed support for United Nations' and other
international activity in reducing ethnic tensions and promoting
national reconciliation in the region, and encouraged governments
concerned to continue to cooperate in these activities to bring
about a real improvement in the situation.

<HEADLINE> Indian Economic Scenario Worsening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 14 (Xinhua) -- India's economy is expected to
get worse before it can become better, according to the latest
study report of the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE)
available here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The GDP growth is expected to dive down to a mere 4.5 to 5
percent during fiscal 1998-99 (April 1, 1998-March 31, 1999) and
the foreign exchange reserves are to fall by about 3 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The events in the first quarter of 1998-99 were not very
favorable for external commercial borrowing. The nuclear tests in
May 1998 followed by the lowering of the country's outlook from
stable to negative by Standard &AMP; Poor's and Duff &AMP; Phelps and the
double downgrade of India's sovereign rating by Moody's will
increase the cost of borrowing substantially, CMIE said.
</P>
<P>
During 1997-98 total foreign investments have been estimated at
5.1 billion dollars of which foreign direct investment accounted
for 3.2 billion, net foreign institutional investors' inflow 1.6
billion and global deposit receipts issues 290,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the first three months of the current fiscal year, there was
a cumulative decline in foreign exchange reserves of 1.6 billion
dollars compared with a hefty 3 billion dollar increase in the
corresponding period of 1997-98, CMIE said.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Minister Ramakrishna Hegde has caused new alarm by
stating that the export target set for this year, which is 20
percent more than last year, would remain a distant dream, CMIE
further said.
</P>
<P>
Large infrastructure projects will continue to face serious
bottlenecks on policy issues and a tougher business environment.
Even the industrial growth will be lower at 4.5 percent compared
with 6.6 percent in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
The most serious of all is the rise in prices. Annual rate of
inflation has already crossed the 7-percent mark, CMIE added.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka May Not Sign Military Accord With U.S.: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is unlikely to sign the
Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) with the United States, a report
of the national news agency BSS said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Bangladesh has nothing to gain by signing the SOFA. Rather, it
(SOFA) would be detrimental to the national interest," the news
agency quoted a "competent source" at the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs as saying.
</P>
<P>
"National interest will be above everything" while entering
into any agreement with any country, big or small, on any issue,
be it on economic matters or military affairs, the source said.
</P>
<P>
The prospect of signing the SOFA is "bleak" although "we have
close cooperation with the U.S. in many fields including the area
of defense," the source said.
</P>
<P>
"No countries in South Asia, Southeast Asia and the Middle East
except Israel signed this treaty with the U.S.," the source
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The proposed agreement would provide for entry of U.S. troops
into Bangladesh without passport and visa, but no such reciprocal
facilities would be given to Bangladeshi defense personnel going
to the United States for training and other purposes, according to
the source.
</P>
<P>
As a member of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC), Bangladesh has a responsibility for the
region as a whole and could not allow entry of foreign troops into
the region which might have "profound and far-reaching
consequences," it added.
</P>
<P>
Stationing of foreign troops in or frequent entry of alien
forces into the country might have an adverse impact. "We don't
see any reasonable ground or need to have an umbrella agreement
like the SOFA," it said.
</P>
<P>
Americans desirous of entering Bangladesh to carry out relief
operations, or for military exercises or for other legitimate
purposes could do so through a memorandum of understanding (MOU)
on a case-by-case basis. "We can have as many MOUs as required,"
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Besides visa-free entry for U.S. troops, other clauses such as
those providing unrestricted movement for American troops in the
country and the entry of equipment and supplies carried by U.S.
troops without undergoing customs clearances are not acceptable to
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
"Allowing entry of weapons and equipment in the country without
customs duty is against the law of the country and it will require
constitutional amendment," the sources explained.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has military cooperation with a number of countries,
including India, Pakistan, Thailand, Britain, Austria and the
United States, but only the United States has proposed such an
agreement, the source added.

<HEADLINE> Berlusconi Sentenced to Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Former Italian former premier Silvio
Berlusconi was sentenced to two years and four months in jail
Monday for illegal party financing.
</P>
<P>
Berlusconi, 61, was also fined 10 billion lire (about 5.7
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The media magnate was alleged to have illegally channeled 22
billion lire (12.5 million dollars) to ex-premier Bettino Craxi
and his Socialist Party.
</P>
<P>
Craxi was given a jail sentence of four years and a fine of 20
billion lire during the same trial.
</P>
<P>
The verdict against Berlusconi Monday was the third conviction
the billionaire has received since last December 3, when he was
given a 16-months suspended sentence for false accounting in the
1989 buy-out of the Medusa film company.
</P>
<P>
On July 7, Berlusconi was sentenced to two years and nine
months jail for bribes paid to tax police by Fininvest, a holding
company of Berlusconi.
</P>
<P>
Despite these verdicts, Berlusconi, as a member of parliament,
cannot be jailed without parliamentary approval. The legal
procedure to obtain the approval could take several years.
</P>
<P>
Berlusconi was premier for seven months in 1994 and now heads
the opposition coalition, the Freedom Alliance.

<HEADLINE> General Motors Recalling One Million Cars to Fix Air Bags </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, July 13 (Xinhua) -- General Motors Corp. announced
Monday that it is recalling nearly one million cars because their
air bags may deploy by accident.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after 161 injuries were registered from
301 reports of air bags inadvertently deploying.
</P>
<P>
Among the 966,000 recalled cars, the company said, there are
863,000 GM Chevrolet Cavaliers and Pontiac Sunfires from the 1996
and 1997 model years, and 103,000 Cadillac DeVille, Seville and
Eldorado from model year 1995.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA), General Motors said the recall will begin
in August and dealers will change the software programing in the
air bag computer so the air bag does not inflate in less forceful
collisions.
</P>
<P>
There are about 75 million vehicles on the U.S. road with
driver-side air bags, and about 47 million also have
passenger-side air bags.
</P>
<P>
NHTSA has received reports that 108 people have been killed by
air bags, including 63 children, according to government records.
</P>
<P>
The administration is also investigating reports of similar
problems concerning Chrysler minivans and cars, Subarus, Mazdas
and Volvos.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft launched its new
HomeAdvisor service on Monday, offering nationwide real-estate
listings, plus photos, maps and lending information.
</P>
<P>
HomeAdvisor is not expected to make a profit soon, but the
service is a way to gain a foothold in a business many think will
become profitable in the future.
</P>
<P>
By making it easier to find homes for sale and arrange loan
services over the Web, Microsoft hopes to capture a chunk of the
mortgage fee market, a business worth seven billion U.S. dollars
annually.
</P>
<P>
While receiving a commission, Microsoft hopes to generate
revenue from advertising and from sponsorship fees from companies
selling products to home buyers.
</P>
<P>
The depth of data varies from home to home. Some include
pictures and detailed structural descriptions, others just mention
the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. The software company
promises daily updates and hopes to persuade companies to offer
richer, more complete information.
</P>
<P>
HomeAdvisor also offers services such as a calculator that
compares renting with buying, a neighborhood finder based on
school, crime and demographic data and an e-mail feature that
notifies its subscribers when interest rates reach a certain point
or a property becomes available.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft competitors include already-established online
home-finding services, loan providers and financial services.
</P>
<P>
A recent National Association of Realtors survey found that 18
percent of buyers in the United States searched for a house on the
Internet in the second half of 1997. But only two percent of them
eventually bought homes during the same period.

Microsoft has already been offering online services for booking
air tickets and buying cars.

district of Pabna. Another person died in hospital later.
</P>
<P>
The bus fell into a roadside ditch while the truck fled, the

<HEADLINE> Kazakhs Urged to Guard Against World Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The central government of
Kazakhstan has asked local governments to take preventive measures
against any adverse impact of the ongoing international financial
crisis on the national economy.
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum on consolidating economic stability, the
central government on Saturday ordered leaders at all levels to
make efforts to increase budgetary revenues and reduce
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
The international financial crisis has led to a crude oil price
drop on the world market, which reduced tax income for the
government, the memorandum said.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided to lower tax rates of crude oil and
oil products to encourage exports of these products.
</P>
<P>
It will continue to improve tax collection and the work of the
customs besides establishing a national taxpayer registration
system.
</P>
<P>
To cut back public spendings, the government also imposed
consumption restrictions on mobile telephones, business travels,
refurbishing of offices, transportation and energy.
</P>
<P>
The number of civil servants will be slashed before September 1
on the basis of a national survey and the construction of non-key
projects will be suspended to reduce the burden on national
budget.

<HEADLINE> Pudong Farmers Move Into Urban Residential Quarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Under a massive land-saving plan,
more than half of the 650,000 farmers living in Shanghai's Pudong
area will move into urban residential quarters by the year 2000,
today's China Daily Reports.
</P>
<P>
As local farmers are getting richer, more and more of them want
to build large houses to live in, thus posing a big threat to the
farmland.
</P>
<P>
In order to save the land, all the town-level governments in
Pudong have worked out plans to renovate the existing natural
villages or to build residential sites designed to house as many
as thousands of families, the English-newspaper says.
</P>
<P>
Pudong now boasts more than 2,300 villages, with nearly 500 of
them housing just two or three families.
</P>
<P>
Under a village reorganization scheme, large natural villages
with more than 100 households will be reorganized into a more
concentrated living place.
</P>
<P>
Such village won't be completed knocked down. And the
renovation will mainly concentrate previous scattered families to
a certain area.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, on average, a house in such a
renovated village will cost 150,000-160,000 yuan (18,072-19,300 US
dollars), with about 120,000 yuan paid by farmers and the
remaining subsidized by the government.
</P>
<P>
Farmers who have to make room for the construction of the
Pudong International Airport and its supporting infrastructure
have also moved to some newly--built residential areas.
</P>
<P>
All 28 towns in Pudong will have 50 residential quarters to
house farmers. The quarters will be equipped with infrastructure
and public utility facilities and have plenty of green spaces.
</P>
<P>
With Pudong's improved transportation system, farmers will
enjoy the commute between the living places and their farmland.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Myanmar Strives to Promote Women's Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is paying special attention
 to promotion of the role of women and is implementing a national
action plan to speed up efforts for improving women's conditions
in the nation.
</P>
<P>
These efforts include carrying out tasks in line with the
Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action adopted at the Fourth
World Conference on Women held in Beijing in 1995 and the policy
of the state.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar reaffirmed that the country's women enjoy equal rights
with the men and pledges to uphold the tradition of Myanmar's
participation in multilateral cooperation and collaborate in the
action plan for development of the world's women.
</P>
<P>
After agreeing to the Beijing Declaration, Myanmar formed the
National Committee for Women's Affairs (NCWA) to carry out the
country's development projects for women including health,
education, socioeconomic development and protection of Myanmar
women against violence.
</P>
<P>
According to the official media, the NCWA has been able to
adopt systematic plans and projects for uplifting the role of
women all over the country and success has been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Especially under the leadership of the NCWA, the Myanmar
Maternal, Child and Welfare Association (MMCWA), a
non-governmental organization formed earlier in 1991, has made
significant progress in the past seven years, getting its more
than 540,000 members involved in activities such as providing
health service to mothers and children in urban and rural areas,
reducing the death rate of mothers and babies and conducting
education on breast-feeding.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar promulgated the MMCWA Law in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Other women's organizations such as Myanmar Women's Sports
Federation, Myanmar Medical Association and Myanmar Women
Entrepreneurial Association are also leading the country's women
in carrying out social welfare tasks.
</P>
<P>
Of Myanmar's total population of 46.4 million in the 1997-98
fiscal year, 23.6 million or 50.34 percent are women, according to
the latest official report on the country's financial, economic
and social conditions.
</P>
<P>
The latest census in 1994 showed that 46 percent of Myanmar
women above the age of 10 were in the labor force in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar women have had a long history of access to education.
In the basic education system, the proportion of female to male
students is one to one according to a study on the education
sector while female students in higher education comprise about 58
percent of the total enrollment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the national literacy rate of women has gone up to
71.3 percent in the past 10 years.

<HEADLINE> Moldova to Cut Social Security Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Moldovan government has
decided to cut back spendings on social security in a bid to ease
heavy burdens on the national budget.
</P>
<P>
The government has been unable to pay salaries to its
employees, including parliament members, due to a severe financial
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
The total salary arrears have reached 500 million Moldovan leu
(106 million U.S. dollars), and the problem is more acute in
departments of education, public health and police, said MEDIAFAX.
</P>
<P>
The current financial crisis is mainly caused by the bad
performance of loss-making enterprises. In Moldova, 80 percent of
the agricultural units and 50 percent of the industrial and mining
sectors are in heavy debt. One third of the enterprises in the
country are on the brink of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
In order to tide over the crisis, the government decided last
month to reduce public spendings and increase taxes. Parliament
President Dumitru Diacov has urged enterprises to pay tax arrears
immediately.
</P>
<P>
The total foreign debt of Moldova now stands at 1.3 billion
dollars, accounting for six percent of its GDP.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Urges ASEAN to Seek Common Identity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai has stressed the need to promote the common identity of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in order to
strengthen the sense of community within the grouping.
</P>
<P>
"We all have our national identities, but I believe we should
also try to promote a common regional identity as well," Chuan
told the on-going Fifth Conference of ASEAN Information Ministers
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by Tuesday's Nation newspaper as reiterating that
this sense of common identity will help foster a stronger sense of
community as well as increased ASEAN awareness.
</P>
<P>
"This sense of belonging is necessary if ASEAN is to move
forward as a single community, thus meeting the objectives of our
founding fathers," he said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN, he said, needs to achieve better understanding among
their peoples through promotion of media links and improved
knowledge among technocrats and grassroots organizations about
ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said free flow of information will make the world a more
open society, in which ASEAN will also be inspired.
</P>
<P>
In the ASEAN Vision 2020, the organization's leaders envisage
vibrant and open societies consistent with their respective
national identities, where all people enjoy equitable access to
opportunities for total human development regardless of gender,
race, religion, language and social and cultural background.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, Chuan said, does not restrict access to outside news
and information and its government is fully committed to the
increased transparency and free flow of information.
</P>
<P>
He said Thailand wants to export news and information to the
outside world and expressed the wish to see other countries in the
region make more use of news emanating from Thailand.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN now groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Reiterates Missile-Supply Promise to Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
reiterated on Monday his country's promise to provide Cyprus with
S-300 anti-aircraft missiles, a Russian presidential aide said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin repeated the promise during a meeting with visiting
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides, who began a tour in Moscow on
July 11 as a guest of honor at the World Youth Games, Yeltsin's
aide for international issues Sergei Prikhodyko said.
</P>
<P>
Prikhodyko said that the two presidents discussed bilateral
ties and also ways to resolve the dispute between the
internationally recognized Cyprus government of the mainly Greek
south of the island and the Turkish north.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents said they were willing to improve economic
ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed satisfaction with their common ground on
way to resolve the Cyprus issue, reaffirming their position on the
supply of the S-300s to Cyprus by Russia, which are scheduled to
be delivered next month.
</P>
<P>
Prikhodyko noted that military cooperation was an element in
the two countries' relations.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot President's trip followed a visit by Defense
Minister Yiannakis Omirou from July 7 to 10, who held talks with
his Russian counterpart Igor Dmitriyevich Sergeyev on
technological cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unresolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkish troops took over the northern
part of the island in the aftermath of a failed coup by Greek
Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government, echoed by a Russian Foreign Ministry
official, has declared that the missile deal could be cancelled if
progress is achieved in reaching a peaceful settlement, for
example, on the island's demilitarization.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots
broke down last summer when Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash
walked out in protest at European Union's intention to open
accession talks with the Cypriot government.

<HEADLINE> Philippines, Malaysia Sign Bilateral Payment Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines and Malaysia have
signed a pioneering bilateral trade payment scheme that would
reduce the two countries' reliance on dollars, a leading newspaper
revealed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement is just an initial step," the Philippine Daily
Inquirer quoted Philippine Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, I think it sends an important signal that we are
deeply committed to fostering international trade through
innovative arrangements despite the current regional crisis,"
Singson said.
</P>
<P>
Singson said it was the first bilateral arrangement of its kind
forged among the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
member countries.
</P>
<P>
It involves regularly netting out over two-month periods export
and import transactions accumulated between the two countries
within accounts to be maintained by their central banks.
</P>
<P>
Although the net transactions will still be settled by the
respective central banks in U.S. dollars, the bilateral scheme is
seen to reduce the volume of actual monetary transfers between the
two countries and potentially save on transaction costs.
</P>
<P>
The government believes that the new arrangement would further
stimulate bilateral trade with Malaysia, Singson said.
</P>
<P>
Total bilateral trade between the two countries stood at about
1.6 billion U.S. dollars in 1997 and has been increasing by 34
percent during the last three years.

<HEADLINE> Inspections to Ensure Teaching Efficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The state will enhance performance
inspections of education departments and school authorities to
ensure students are receiving efficient instruction, said today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The inspections will include public supervision more often to
ensure fair practices are used, according to Guo Zhenyou, director
of the Department for Educational Inspection under the Ministry of
Education.
</P>
<P>
Educational inspections have been carried out for 10 years and
have helped improve compulsory and secondary education. China has
22,831 educational inspectors -- administrators who know the
education laws, regulations and situations.
</P>
<P>
Numerous inspections have been carried out in China regarding
implementation of the Compulsory Education Law, anti-illiteracy
campaigns and popularization of the nine-year compulsory
education, Guo said.
</P>
<P>
The inspections played an important role in improving teachers'
working and living conditions, stopping inconsistent fee
collections in some schools, easing students' heavy homework
burdens and building and revamping school buildings, he said.
</P>
<P>
Educational inspections resumed in China in 1986 when the
government issued the Compulsory Education law, Guo noted.

<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The pursuit of modern family life

<HEADLINE> China's First BOT Waterworks Project Inked in Chengdu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- China's first water supply BOT
(build, operate and transfer) project will be built in Chengdu,
capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
A construction agreement on the 100 million U.S. dollars
project was signed in Chengdu on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Parties to the agreement were: the Chengdu municipal
government; the Generale des Eaux Group of France, the world's
biggest urban water supply infrastructure supplier; and the
Marubeni Corp. of Japan.
</P>
<P>
This is the first urban water infrastructural project approved by
the central government to experiment with the use of foreign funds
under the BOT plan, said Wang Rongxuan, mayor of Chengdu, at the
signing ceremony for the agreement of Chengdu No. 6 Water Plant B
BOT project.
</P>
<P>
The project involves construction of a water plant in Chengdu
with a capacity of 400,000 tons of clean water a day and
construction of a 27-km-long water pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Official construction is scheduled before March 1999. After
completion, which is expected before September 2001, the Chengdu
municipal government will purchase 400,000 tons of clean water a
day from the plant, according to You Zhiyi, deputy chief of the
Chengdu Municipal Public Utilities Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The water project will ease the increasing pressure of
Chengdu's urban water supply capacity, said You. With a population
of nearly 3.2 million, the city has four water plants which
produce an average of 1.05 million tons of tap water a day. But
demand for water supply is increasing by 10 to 15 percent per
year. More water plants are needed.
</P>
<P>
A company jointly set up by the General des Eaux Group and the
Marubeni Corp will be responsible for the Chengdu No. 6 Water
Plant B BOT project's investment, construction, operation and
maintenance. After owning the plant for 18 years, the company will
transfer it to the Chengdu municipal government free of charge,
said Daniel Caille, president of the General des Eaux Group.

BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- This year China will begin to step
up its administration of earthquake-proofing designs in a bid to
strengthen the capacity of buildings over 120 meters high to
withstand earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
Vice minister of construction Ye Rutang said here today that
with fast economic development and urban construction, highrise
buildings are mushrooming nationwide, with more than 300 already
built.
</P>
<P>
But a survey of building designs in a dozen cities shows that
many latent problems exist in these structures and their ability
to withstand seismic activity must be improved.
</P>
<P>
To improve the reliability and safety of the design of these
buildings, the Ministry of Construction has issued Provisional
Administrative Rules Over Anti-seismic Design for Highrises, and
set forth strict demands that designing institutes must follow in
making architectural and earthquake-proofing plans.

<HEADLINE> El Nino Hits Chile Fish Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The export of aquatic products
from Chile totalled 765 million U.S. dollars in the first five
months of this year, 11.7 percent less than in the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
Official figures released here on Monday suggest the drop was
the result of the El Nino phenomena, which warmed the sea near
Chile and drove fish away from the region.
</P>
<P>
Japan, which took 40.7 percent of all Chilean fish exports, was
still the largest buyer, while the United States and China
remained second and the third.
</P>
<P>
The report predicted that the fish output would rise back
slowly as El Nino vanished, but the total output this year could
not reach the level of last year.
</P>
<P>
Fish is the second largest pillar industry for exports by Chile.
</P>
<P>
Last year, fish exports earned 187.2 million dollars, making
this South American country the fifth largest fish producer in the

<HEADLINE> Top Academy to Emphasize Academics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The prestigious Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences (CASS) has decided to emphasize academics rather
than focusing on "minor practical problems."
</P>
<P>
Li Tieying, the academy's newly appointed president, has told
the institute's 3,000 scholars the study of basic theories must be
strengthened and other achievements should be a result of this
fundamental work.
</P>
<P>
"It cannot be called in-depth research if we merely make
suggestions for decision-makers without studying basic theories,"
said Li, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party
of China Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Li replaced former president Hu Sheng, a well-known Marxist
historian, in March of this year.
</P>
<P>
The CASS, established in 1977, is regarded as the
central government think tank. In recent years, many of its
scholars have been engaged in designing China's reform and
opening-up.
</P>
<P>
Generally, programs that target hot economic and social topics
are easily granted subsidies. Some people have worried that this
trend might be too practical, and that "abstract and boring
subjects," such as archeology and anthropology, will be ignored.
</P>
<P>
Li said that practical research should be stepped up, but it
must deal with strategic and overall issues concerning the
nation's development.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the CASS told Xinhua that some research
programs engaged in by certain institutes with the goal of serving
government and Party leaders appear too short-sighted, and that
these programs do not reflect the major function of the
CASS.
</P>
<P>
He said the CASS has a limited capability for studying some
practical problems concerning government departments, especially
in the field of information gathering.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pak Government Faces Herculean Task </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is teetering on the
brink of a financial meltdown as the much-needed external sources
of aid and assistance have now almost dried up due to the
sanctions triggered by the detonation of nuclear devices.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, with its economy much dependent on the foreign
assistance, faces an imminent default situation by the end of this
month as foreign exchange reserves evaporate and new foreign
exchange income is blocked owing to the freezing of its foreign
currency accounts.
</P>
<P>
To avoid a default, Pakistan needs nearly 5 billion U.S.
dollars a year to meet interest repayments on its hefty 36 billion
dollar foreign debt, including 1 billion dollars for interest
repayments in the third quarter of this year (July to September)
alone.
</P>
<P>
With a mere foreign exchange reserve of less than 800 million
dollars, which has already been reduced by 500 million dollars
since the nuclear tests at the end of May, Pakistan is facing an
arduous task to service its debt.
</P>
<P>
It is feared that Pakistan might be forced to declare a partial
moratorium on its debt repayments in less than a month if
international financial institutions like the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank withheld the release of
agreed loans as a penalty for its nuclear tests on May 28.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz said that about 1.2 billion
dollars in multilateral assistance due between June to September
this year was locked in sanctions imposed by some western
countries.
</P>
<P>
Under this situation, the finance minister said, Pakistan will
face balance of payments difficulties in two to three months if
the international financial institutions did not release the
committed funds.
</P>
<P>
At the end of this month, Pakistan will have to pay roughly 800
million dollars toward its huge dollars debt. Without
international assistance, that amount of payment will wipe out
Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves, leaving this South Asian
nation of 130 million people with no money to pay for imports.
</P>
<P>
The IMF sent a fact-finding mission last week to Islamabad and
held extensive talks with the Pakistani government. It was the
first visit to Pakistan by an IMF team since Pakistan conducted
nuclear tests at the end of May in the wake of similar tests by
its neighbor India in mid-May.
</P>
<P>
Paul Chabrier, IMF director for the Middle East region,
appreciated the progress made by Pakistan in the last 15 months in
respect of the economy and in implementing important structural
policies.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, although the economic performance has
improved, the release of funds also depends on the outlook of what
is forthcoming in external financing. In this area, he said, the
G-7, the donor countries, have an influential say.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Congress to Ratify CTBT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- United States President Bill
Clinton on Monday urged the U.S. Senate to ratify the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Brazil's ratification of the treaty, which was
approved by the United Nations assembly in September 1996 and has
been signed by 149 countries, Clinton reaffirmed his call to the
Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
"I call on the Senate to act expeditiously to approve the
CTBT... so that the United States can lead in this vital
endeavor," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president spoke highly of Brazil's approval of the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
"Brazil's decision renews momentum for the international effort
to halt the spread of nuclear weapons and promote disarmament
around the world," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"At a time when actions by India and Pakistan threaten a
nuclear competition in South Asia, Brazil has chosen a different
course -- to invest in its people, not in a costly arms race," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress has refused to ratify the nuclear test ban
treaty several times.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pak Government Faces Herculean Task </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The relations between the IMF and Pakistan have strained
following
sanctions slapped by G-8 member countries (including Russia) when
Islamabad opted to go nuclear in response to earlier Indian
nuclear
tests.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions spurred the IMF to postpone the further release
of
loans to Pakistan despite the fact that Pakistan had qualified for
it
by meeting all the macroeconomic targets set by the IMF. The delay
in
the release created serious problems for Pakistan since its
balance
of payments position is precarious.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan government asked the IMF to fulfill its commitment
to
a three-year 1.6 billion dollar balance of payments support to
Islamabad since it had met all the conditions set by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Admitting for the first time that the economy was unlikely to
withstand the pressure of sanctions, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
has
written a letter to leaders of G-7 countries emphasizing the need
for
immediate restoration of support from international financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
After explaining the circumstances that led to the exercise of
the
nuclear option by Pakistan, Sharif emphasized that since Pakistan
had
successfully implemented the ESAF/Eff (Extended Structural
Adjustment
Facility/Extended Fund Facility) program, it would only be fair
for
donors to continue with the program.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports the IMF has asked Pakistan to sign
the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) to get the loan suspended by
the
Washington-based agency under pressure from G-8 countries.
</P>
<P>
So far Pakistan has refused to succumb to the United States and

sign the CTBT. "Islamabad wants international guarantees for the
peaceful solution of the core issue of Kashmir in accordance with
the
U.N. resolutions," Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
Unless the international community promised to play its role
effectively in the resolution of the Kashmir dispute Pakistan
would
not budge an inch, the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here are of the view that the present situation is
grim
and may become grimmer still if, in retaliation, the international

sanctions are tightened and enforced with full force.
</P>
<P>
Already remittances have almost dried up because of the wide
differential between official and unofficial rates of foreign
exchange.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, this South Asian nation remains in the grip of
panic.
The stock market index has dipped to a record low because of
eroding
confidence of investors. Inflation, on the other hand, is also
expected to rise significantly in the near future.
</P>
<P>
This is the situation which the Pakistani government has to
face
whether it has been engineered abroad or created by itself.
</P>
<P>
The government has now been left with very few options in the
post-nuclear test economic scenario. If loans from international
financial institutions are not resumed immediately, the choice
left
to the government is either to declare an immediate moratorium on
its
foreign debt, or do nothing until its foreign exchange reserves
are
totally depleted.

<HEADLINE> Russia Stages Games Opening Ceremony, Wins Four Golds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Russia staged a grand opening
ceremony of the World Youth Games Monday night, showcasing its
multi-ethnic culture and high technology marked by the Mir space
station and expertise to stop rain.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, International Olympic
Committee President Juan Samaranch, and Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov
attended the two-hour extravaganza along with some 60,000
specataors and athletes.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin wished the young contests, about 7,000 aged 12-17 from
137 countries and regions, "luck, records and medals".
</P>
<P>
"Not all of you will be winners. But, as the Olympic motto says
-- Victory is not important; the main thing is participation," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
The games started last Saturday but the opening ceremony was
put off to Monday so that ranking sports officials in France for
the World Cup soccer matches could arrive here on time and weary
fans could shift their attention to the Moscow events.
</P>
<P>
Three days into the games, six gold medals had been awarded,
four to Russian boys in the Greco-Roman wrestling matches. The
other two gold medalists were Yevangelos Zabrakas from Greece,
also in Greco-Roman wrestling, and Pawel Bonisch of Poland in
Fencing epee.
</P>
<P>
Monday night's gala at the Luzhniki Statium on the bank of
Moscow River and facing the picturesque Sparrow Hills repeatedly
drew the spectators' attention to Russia's past as a sports
powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic flame, brought in from Greece after a three-week
relay race, was passed on to the Mishutka bear cub, the games'
mascot, by 24 Russian Olympic gold medalists.
</P>
<P>
Today's Russia remains a formidable force in world sports and
it young athletes, totaling 210, are widely expected to grab the
most medals in the Youth Games.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the gala have apparently succeeded in their
attempt to boost the national pride of Russians and to please most
foreign participants.
</P>
<P>
Cossacks on horseback and Eskimos riding dog-powered sleds were
featured along with performers from many other Russian regions
such as Volga and Ural.
</P>
<P>
After a countdown, the two huge panel displays in the stadium
shown footages of Russian cosmonauts greeting Muscovites and
participants of the games from the Mir space station.
</P>
<P>
As the extravaganza approached its climax, the sky over the
stadium started to clear up, thanks to the Russians'
state-of-the-art technology in dispersing the rain-laden clouds
over Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Six AN-12 and AN-30 planes took off hours before the start of
the opening ceremony to fulfil the task from an altitude of
6,000-8,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
The performances also featured cartoon figures of various
countries of the world, such as dragon-dancing Chinese,
bull-fighting Spaniards, snake-charming Indians and a Statue of
Liberty carried by Donald Duck.

his recession-hit nation into uncertainty and casting a dark cloud
over other Asian economies.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The 40-market overnight rating
for Sunday's World Cup final between Brazil and France was 46
percent lower than the Brazil-Italy final four years ago in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The big drop stems largely from the poor displays by the U.S.
soccer team and the limited attention paid to the world No. 1
sport by the Americans.
</P>
<P>
When the final national numbers are released, ABC should show
about a 50 percent drop in ratings for 12 games.
</P>
<P>
"We had realistic expectations for the World Cup, but we don't
only measure the success of the tournament by those numbers," said
ABC sports spokesman Mark Mandel.
</P>
<P>
A rating point for ABC represents 980,000 households. ABC and
ESPN were expected to show a modest profit on the 22 million U.S.
dollars TV right fees.
</P>
<P>
The 2002 World Cup is likely to see the rating drop even more
since the competitions in South Korea and Japan force earlier
starting times.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Guilin, a scenic city in south
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, hosted close to 3.3
million tourists in the first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The figure included 147,000 overseas tourists, down 19.2
percent on the previous year's period, with the number of domestic
tourists growing by 13 percent to 3.15 million, according to the
city's tourism management department.
</P>
<P>
Figures showed that tourism generated 1.36 billion
yuan, up 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
The decline in foreign tourists was attributed to the
adverse effects of the financial crisis in Southeast Asia, which
has long been a primary source of tourism in the city.
</P>
<P>
Local officials attributed the rapid increase in domestic
tourists to the city's intensified efforts to stage tourism
promotions and activities, as well as to the improved order of the
tourism market which promoted confidence and interest in the
beautiful city.
</P>
<P>
Guilin plans to open an Internet website in August to promote
tourism in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The city will also join hands with Xi'an, Beijing, Shanghai,
and Hong Kong to promote the "Presidential Travel" program in the
United States in order to attract more foreign tourists.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Nonprofit Groups Turning to Cyberspace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 13 (xinhua) -- Charities and other nonprofit
groups in the United States are turning to cyberspace to raise
money.
</P>
<P>
What attracts many nonprofit groups is the prospect of a cheap,
easy way to reach an estimated 57 million Americans with access to
the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
Many nonprofits originally set up Web sites to spread their
mission and offer online activism. Now they are adding encryption
technology that makes it safer to send credit-card information
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Also, they use the techniques of electronic commerce to accept
online credit-card donations and conduct upscale auctions over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
The philanthropic spinoff of e-commerce is still in its
infancy; no one tracks how many nonprofits are fund-raising
online, or how many money they are bringing in. Yet a growing
number of nonprofits regard the Internet as a way to reduce their
reliance on expensive fund-raising methods like direct mail and
phone banking, according to Knight Ridder Newspapers.

GuideStar is a nonprofit online service that lists information
and financial data for 40,000 American charities and non-profit
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The trend has spawned a cottage industry of consultants and
companies that create or host secure Web sites for the non-profits
-- sometimes in exchange for a cut of the contributions.
</P>
<P>
CharityWeb, a California-based startup which has signed up
contracts with seven agencies, for instance, charges full
membership 99 U.S. dollars for setup, plus 2.5 percent to 5.5
percent per transaction.
</P>
<P>
The most successful online fund-raisers are philanthropy's
biggest brand names, such as the American Cancer Society and the
American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
The American Cancer Society began raising money in 1995 through
an online form that could be downloaded, then faxed or mailed.
This low-tech way trickled 3,000 dollars in each month. Online
contributions have grown fourfold since the nonprofit added secure
transactions to its Web site.
</P>
<P>
The American Red Cross launched online contributions in July
1996 and has raised about 128,000 dollars since then. During the
Midwest floods of 1997, contributions shot up to 300 monthly, up
from a more typical 25 to 40 per month.

UNITED NATIONS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The deployment of the
peacekeeping operation in Sierra Leone demonstrates the interest
the United Nations had in maintaining international peace and
security in Africa, Shen Guofang, Chinese deputy representative to
the United Nations, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Shen said it also demonstrated the interest of the United
Nations in establishing security and restoring economic stability
in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council adopted a resolution Monday morning which
decided to establish the United Nations Observer Mission in Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the council before it adopted the resolution, Shen
said China would give positive consideration to dispatching
military observers to the mission.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the mission would pay full attention to the
opinions of the government of Sierra Leone and cooperate with the

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Reports on Abacha Poisoned to Death Inconclusive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States said Monday
that it had reports that Nigerian leader Sani Abacha, who died
suddenly last month, was poisoned but the information was not
conclusive.
</P>
<P>
"We're aware of reports to that effect," State Department
spokesman James Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
But he said, "We do not have conclusive evidence that General
Abacha was poisoned."
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government reported after Abacha's sudden death on
June 8 that he had died of a sudden heart attack at his villa.
</P>
<P>
But the New York Times said Saturday that some U.S. analysts
believed Abacha might have been poisoned by his enemies.
</P>
<P>
However, the conclusion is "far from unanimous" among the
analysts, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin indicated the U.S. government reports go beyond what has
been in media stories but gave no other details.

<HEADLINE> Annan Recommends MINURSO Mandate Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Monday recommended extension of the mandate of the United
Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) for
a further period of two months until September 21, 1998.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, Annan said there had
been a substantial increase in the pace of identification in June
ans early July which would, if sustained, enable the MINURSO to
complete, during the month of August 1998, the identification of
applicants from all Sahara other than the three contested tribes.
</P>
<P>
Annan said both Morocco and the POLISARIO Front had generally
been cooperating in enduring that the process moved forward, which
would be imperative therefore to resolve their differences so that
the identification of all applicants other than the three
contested tribes might be completed on schedule.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that by the end of June, sufficient progress had
been made in the identification process and in the search for
solution to the contentious issue of the contested tribal issues,
and he would submit recommendations for a revised timetable for
the full implementation of the Settlement Plan.

<HEADLINE> British Scientists Develop Robot "Doctor" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- British scientists said Monday that
they have developed a robot "doctor" that can diagnose brain
cancer from reading complex scan results.
</P>
<P>
The computer program, which uses neural networks that model the
way the brain thinks, interprets patterns from a sophisticated
type of scanning technique called magnetic resonance spectroscopy
(MRS).
</P>
<P>
MRS scans, which can show the pattern of chemicals within
tumors, help doctors determine the type of brain tumor and how
severe the cancer is.
</P>
<P>
However, most doctors still prefer to diagnose and assess
tumors by conducting tests on surgically removed tissue sample
because the MRS scans are difficult to read.
</P>
<P>
With the new computer program, interpretation of the images and
graph from MRS scans becomes both automatic and objective. So far
the program has had an 80 percent success rate analyzing cancerous
tissue taken from patients.
</P>
<P>
"These results are very exciting as MRS could be a far better
way of diagnosing and assessing a tumor than a biopsy because it
does not involve surgery," Professor John Griffiths, of St George
Hospital Medical School in London, told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Griffiths and scientists from Britain's Cancer Research
Campaign have been working on the computer technique for the past
10 years. The program was designed by Dr Ross Maxwell, a former
researcher from the Cancer Research Campaign.

<HEADLINE> UK Gov't to Inject 1.1 Billion Pounds into Science </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The British government Monday
unveiled plans to inject 1.1 billion pounds (1.8 billion U.S.
dollars) of new money into science and engineering with an aim to
upgrade the country's research infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the investment, Margaret Beckett, president of the
Board of Trade, said the money represented a "real vote of
confidence in Britain's scientists and engineers."
</P>
<P>
Much of the money, which will be available over a three-year
period, will go towards building or refurbishing laboratories at
universities. One-third of the cash will provide the research
councils with vital funds.
</P>
<P>
Four hundred million pounds (654.54 million dollars) was given
by the Wellcome Trust, the rest is from public funds, being
provided as part of the British government's Comprehensive
Spending Review, which is to be announced in full Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the new financial boost, the UK's science budget
will grow for each of the next three years from 1.34 billion
pounds (2.2 billion dollars) in 1998-1999 to 1.66 billion pounds
(2.72 billion dollars) in 2001-2002.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Tests Year 2000 Preparedness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street started Monday a
preliminary computer test on its preparedness for entering 2000,
without serious incident in the back offices for the first day.
</P>
<P>
In the first of two weeks of tests, 29 securities firms and 12
exchanges performed mock trades in an effort to determine how Wall
Street's vast computerized trading system will handle the
transition to year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the program said that the efforts were aimed at
ferreting out from members' communications systems signs of the
"year 2000 bug," which could cause computers that are set to read
only the last two digits of the year to malfunction or fail when
the calendar changes to 2000.
</P>
<P>
Experts have warned for years that many computers originally
programmed to recognize only the last two digits of a year will
fail on Jan. 1, 2000, when machines will assume it is 1900.
</P>
<P>
Some computers can be reprogrammed through tedious rewriting of
their software code, but many have embedded microchips that must
be physically replaced.
</P>
<P>
But other experts argued that such old fashioned computers are
rarely in use nowadays and people do not have to worry too much.
</P>
<P>
In back offices up and down Wall Street Monday, computers were
tricked into thinking it was December 29, 1999, and then asked to
execute hundreds of mock trades.
</P>
<P>
For the next two weeks, experts will monitor the changes of the
computer systems and performance of test trades in much smaller
quantities.
</P>
<P>
It is said that the securities industry will spend between 5
billion U.S. dollars and 6 billion U.S. dollars through 1999 to
fix the bug.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seeks to Waive Sanctions on India, Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
Monday asked Congress for authority to waive sanctions just
imposed on India and Pakistan so that it could have more leverage
in lessening harms on U.S. business.
</P>
<P>
"Our purpose is not to punish for punishment's sake, but to
influence the behavior of both governments," Karl Inderfurth,
assistant secretary of state for South Asian affairs, told a
Senate hearing. "We do not wish for unnecessary harm to fall on
the civilian populations of either country... or on U.S.
businesses."
</P>
<P>
Inderfurth said, however, the sanctions won't be waived unless
"substantial progress" is made by India and Pakistan toward
nuclear nonproliferation goals.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration would like to see both India and
Pakistan agree to conduct no further nuclear tests, sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, refrain from attaching their
nuclear weapons to missiles, halt the production of weapons
material and seek peace in the disputed territory of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"These are steps we want to see both government take. They are
not demands.... Countries don't like to be dictated to," he told
the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on Near Eastern and
South Asian affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said leaders of both India and Pakistan had signaled a
willingness to talk about the situation in South Asia. "We will
not let our current momentum slip," he added.

NEW YORK, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar rose against the

The dollar fell against the mark on the news that Russia had

The mark reacted to the development because Germany has close

LONDON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Two men were arrested Monday by
police investigating the arson attack which killed three young
brothers in Ballymoney, Co. Antrim, early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Two men have been arrested this morning in connection with the
suspected sectarian arson attack at Ballymoney early on Sunday," a
police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The police added officers were questioning the men after the
arrest.
</P>
<P>
The three Catholic boys were killed when a firebomb was thrown
into their house at 4:30 am Sunday. Their mother and her partner
escaped from the fire and were treated in hospital.
</P>
<P>
The deaths were blamed on the wave of sectarian violence which
has swept the province during the stand-off between Orangemen and
the security forces at Drumcree, Portadown, since July 5.
</P>
<P>
The killings have sent shock waves through both communities in
Northern Ireland in the wake of a peace deal hammered out by rival
politicians in April.
</P>
<P>
Other Catholic families living on the same housing estate as
the murdered boys had received threats from Protestant "loyalist"
extremists warning them to get out of their homes, the BBC

<HEADLINE> Russia Gets 11 Billion U.S. Dollars From IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Russia will get a total of 11.2
billion U.S. dollars from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as
financial aid in 1998, an IMF high-ranking official said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Director of the IMF's second European Department John
Odling-Smee told a press conference that about 5.6 billion U.S.
dollars will be provided to Russia immediately after its
government takes agreed-on steps.
</P>
<P>
The second half of the aid package, said Odling-Smee, will be
available to the country by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the total amount of the aid to be provided by
the IMF by the end of the year to Russia will reach 12.5 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Odling-Smee meanwhile hailed a decision made by the Russian
government to ask the holders of treasury bonds (GKOs) to convert
them into medium- or long-term bonds denominated in U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He also praised the Russian government's determination to
reduce the budget deficit to 5.6 percent of GDP in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank also intends to provide 6 billion U.S. dollars
in 1998-1999 as investment and budget-substituting loans.
</P>
<P>
During the same period the Japanese government plans to give
1.5 billion U.S. dollars for supporting Russia's balance of
payments through co-financing World Bank loans for economic
restructuring, the Interfax news agency quoted head of the Moscow
office of the World Bank Michael Carter as reporting.
</P>
<P>
Anatoly Chubais, the Kremlin's envoy to international financial
organizations, said Monday that the decision of the IMF and the
World Bank is unprecedented because of the changes that were made
in the procedure of decision-making to honor the Russian
government's request.
</P>
<P>
He noted the government's stabilization program provided the
basis for the talks with the IMF and the World Bank which approved
it as a document sufficient to guarantee the return of these
funds.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States Monday
reiterated that it will never support an independent Kosovo gained
by violence and warned that the ethnic Albanians are also
responsible for the fighting in the region.
</P>
<P>
"They need to realize that their independence goals are not
going to be achieved," State Department spokesman James P. Rubin
said at a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the international community is not going
to support independence for Kosovo or a Greater Albania sought by
some elements.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Albanians have legitimate complaints against the
Yugoslav federation headed by President Slobodan Milosevic, who
stripped the region of its self-rule in 1989 before the Bosnian
war.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman criticized the Albanian extremists in Kosovo
who are fighting for independence.
</P>
<P>
"We have said for some time that the primary responsibility for
this conflict and for the fighting and for the repression and for
the dying is Slobodan Milosevic," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't mean that extremist elements on the
Kosovar-Albanian side are free of responsibility," he added.
</P>
<P>
The United States supports restoration of autonomy for Kosovo,
where the Albanian population has lost many political and ethnic
rights, but no break from what remains of Yugoslavia, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"If they think they are going to resolve and achieve
independence, they are fundamentally mistaken," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its alliance have threatened to take military
action against Yugoslavia if the fighting can't be stopped by
diplomacy.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Continue Working With Japan for Asia Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States said Monday
that Japan remains the key to Asia's recovery from a year-long
financial crisis, and that its policy of relying on Japan for the
recovery also remains intact despite the resignation of Japanese
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
"A healthy Japanese economy is critical for the Asia region and
for the global economy, and the United States will work on the
assumption that the new Japanese government will see that it is in
its own best interest to pursue economic reform expeditiously,"
White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We'll continue to work with them (the Japanese), continue to
press for the kinds of direction in their national economy that we
have suggested time and time again," he said.
</P>
<P>
McCurry urged a newly formed Japanese government would take
quick action on economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
"It is very important to the United States that a new
government, whatever its composition, move quickly to implement
concrete fiscal and banking measures to achieve strong domestic
demand-led growth in Japan and to restore confidence in Japan's
financial system," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We think they will see it in their own self-interest to pursue
economic reform quickly," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto announced his resignation and canceled a planned on
July 22 visit to the United States after his party, the Liberal
Democratic Party, suffered heavy losses in the Upper House
election Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to call President Bill Clinton later Monday,
McCurry said. He also reiterated that Washington was consulting
with Japanese officials on a visit to the United States by
Hashimoto's successor.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Increase in U.N. Core Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Core resources in the U.N.
development system should continue to come from the government
contributions of developed countries, a Chinese representative
told the U.N. Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The lack of core resources has led to the reduction in the
implementation of numerous assistance programs, seriously
undermining the interest of developing countries, said Yuan
Shaofu, representing China at an ECOSOC segment on operational
activities for international development.
</P>
<P>
"Without a strong sense of responsibility and political will,
no funding modality would be able to achieve the goal of
increasing resources," he noted.
</P>
<P>
China appreciates the efforts of the U.N. development system to
implement U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's reform initiatives,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Yuan said the U.N. resident coordinator should be the country
representative of a program to prevent the coordinator at the
country level from becoming anther layer of bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
Regarding private capital activities, Yuan said China agrees
that its complementary role should be fully intergrated, on the
condition that the nature of U.N. operational activities remains
unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Tanzanian Joint Venture of Farm Tools Formed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 13 (Xinhua) - The Tanzanian government and
a Chinese company, backed by the Chinese government, signed
Monday an agreement on establishing a joint venture to produce
farm tools.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania, through its Presidential Parastatal Sector Reform
Commission, and its partner, the Tianjin Machinery Import and
Export Corporation (Group) (TMG), will share the ownership and
operation of the assets of the defunct China-Tanzania Ubungo
Machinery Company Limited (CTU) by 30% and 70% respectively.
</P>
<P>
This ownership ratio reflects the contributions by the two
governments in setting up the Ubungo Farm Implements
Manufacturing Company Limited (UFI) at the Ubungo district in Dar
es Salaam, from which the CTU is born.
</P>
<P>
As part of the agreement, the TMG will take over the Chinese
government loans in the UFI and the Tanzanian government will be
absolved from its Chinese counterpart's loan which was used to
build up UFI over the past years.
</P>
<P>
Apart from making hoes, plows, machetes and other farm
products which were the main business of the UFI, the new CTU
will also make and trade in agricultural machinery, electrical
products and other engineering products.
</P>
<P>
"An investment plan, which is estimated at three million U.S.
Dollars, is earmarked for rehabilitating the factory and for
diversifying it into the new business areas," said the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations on the agreement began in 1996 following an
instruction by Chinese premier Zhu Rongji one year earlier when
he paid a visit to Tanzania, inspecting many of the Chinese-aided
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said joint ventures and cooperation would lead to restore
production and obtain sound economic benefits for the
money-losing enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"The TMG has enough confidence and actual strength to promote
the CTU into a good project gradually," said Li Shaoren, Vice
President of the TMG at the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1956, the TMG runs in the fields of farm tools'
manufacturing, scientific research, and importing and exporting.
</P>
<P>
It has set up six branches and eight representative offices in
the United States, Germany, Australia, Japan, Venezuela, Uganda,
Ethiopia, Hong Kong and other countries and regions all over the
world with more than one thousand regular customers.

<HEADLINE> Israelis, Palestinians to Hold Direct Talks This Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators will hold direct talks after Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat returns from China this week, the State Department said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"When Arafat returns there will be a direct meeting between the
two... the idea is direct engagement," spokesman James Rubin told
reporters. But Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu will not take part in person, he added.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the talks expected Wednesday were essential for
progress towards agreement on the second phase of Israeli
withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
He sharply criticized Israel for holding up an agreement on a
U.S. proposal that suggests Israel hand over 13 percent of land on
the West Bank to the Palestinians, who in return would step up
measures to combat terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He said the Palestinians had accepted the U.S. proposal on the
Israeli pullback and "gone a long way" to combat terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"The ball is not in the Palestinian court. The ball is in the
court of the Israelis to try to work with the Palestinians and
work with us to come to a second `yet,'" he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have a `yes' from the Palestinians and we are looking to
get ourselves in a position where the Israelis can say `yes' as
well," he added.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Israel and the Palestinians should sit down face to
face before they could settle any differences, including their
differences over the Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
"There is no way to get an agreement, and no way to close this
phase down, unless they are in a position to meet with each other
and at least hear each other out," he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Welcomes IMF-Russia Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Monday the agreement between Russia and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) could provide the basis for increased
stability and confidence in the Russian economy.
</P>
<P>
"This new program of Russian policy commitments and
international financial support can provide a sound basis for
increased stability and confidence," White House spokesman Mike
McCurry quoted Clinton as saying.
</P>
<P>
McCurry called multibillion-dollar aid package announced by the
IMF earlier Monday a "major step forward" that showed
international confidence in Russia's economic reform process.
</P>
<P>
Following intense negotiations in Moscow, the IMF announced
that it would back a significant and immediate rise in the amount
of help it provides to Russia.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly support the agreement between Russia and the IMF,"
White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry told reporters. "We view
it as a major step forward in Russia's reform effort."
</P>
<P>
"The size of the package shows strong confidence in Russia's
reform commitments and reflects strong support from the world
community including the IMF, the World Bank and the G7," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States hoped the Russian parliament would take up
enactment of Russia's reform program when it returned from a
recess this week, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the stalled U.S. IMF funding legislation, McCurry
blamed the delays on congressional Republicans.
</P>
<P>
"We have ample evidence in today's developments that the
Republican Congress is being very shortsighted in not moving
forward on the funding commitments we need to deal with these
international economic issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said the loan
package and reforms by the Russian government will strengthen the
country's fiscal position.

<HEADLINE> IMF, World Bank Support for Russia's Staggering Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Michel Camdessus, managing
director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said Monday a
multibillion-dollar loan package for Russia and reforms by the
government would strengthen the country's fiscal position.
</P>
<P>
"The strengthening of Russia's economic policies -- both fiscal
and structural -- the large additional financial resources, and
the debt conversion scheme, should fundamentally improve the
financial situation of the Russian government," Camdessus said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Under the new economic program, Russia's fiscal position is
being strengthened markedly," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said he would recommend to the IMF executive board
that the lending agency provide Russia with 11.2 billion U.S.
dollars in 1998. He said half this amount (about 5.6 billion
dollars) would be provided "as soon as the agreed actions of the
Russian government have been taken, by legislation where
necessary, and upon IMF executive board approval."
</P>
<P>
The rest of the money would be made available later in the
year. Together with resources provided under an existing IMF loan
program with Russia, Camdessus said the total financing from the
IMF during the remainder of 1998 would come to 12.5 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"This support will help Russia face its difficult problems
which have been exacerbated by the sharp decline in commodity
prices, in particular oil," he said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF's executive board would consider the Russian
government's economic reform program on July 20.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the World Bank said it would provide up to 6 billion
dollars to Russia in 1998 and 1999 as part of the IMF rescue
package negotiated in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
"The World Bank stands ready with substantial financial support
to Russia for the implementation of this program and for
mitigating the severe social problems which the Russian people
currently face," World Bank President James Wolfensohn said in a
statement released in Washington.
</P>
<P>
"I am delighted the new Russian government has developed this
ambitious program of structural reform," noted the World Bank
chief. "Its implementation will send the clearest signals that
Russia's economic management is on track -- it should quickly
rebuild confidence and create the basis for the emergence in
Russia of the prosperity that we all want to see."
</P>
<P>
To support the IMF-led rescue, the World Bank said its board of
directors was expected to approve a 1.5 billion dollar structural
adjustment loan for Russia in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Under this loan, 800 million dollars would be made available in
1998.
</P>
<P>
Together with other planned disbursements, the World Bank said
total structural adjustment loan payments for Russia for the rest
of 1998 could reach 1.25 billion dollars. For 1999, the bank said
it planned to disburse 3 billion dollars in adjustment lending, so
long as Russia makes "strong progress" on economic reforms.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Protestants in N.Ireland to End Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department urged
Monday the pro-British Protestants activists to end their protests
over marches after three Catholic boys were killed in a fire-bomb
attack in the British-rule Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular briefing, State Department spokesman
James Rubin said the death of the three boys was "an abomination."
</P>
<P>
"No commemorative march is worth the murder of children," he
said. "We regard the death of the three boys in a sectarian arson
attack as an abomination that is unjustifiable under any
circumstances."
</P>
<P>
"We renew our appeal to responsible Unionist and Loyalist
leaders to abide by the decisions of the Independent Parades
Commission and to end this inflammatory situation, which has
provoked a week of violence," he said.
</P>
<P>
A decision by the commission to curtail one of the marches
prompted a week of violence as Protestant Orangemen demonstrated
for their right to carry out traditional parades through what are
now Catholic areas to commemorate 300-year-old British victories
over the native Irish.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to monitor closely the situation, and remain in
touch with British, Irish and Northern Ireland officials to help
in any way we can," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
The peace process in Northern Ireland was threatened as the
Protestants and Catholics renewed their conflict in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
In March, a peace plan was signed by the parties under the
auspices of the U.S., ending decades of conflict between the
pro-British Protestants and pro-Irish Catholics.

<HEADLINE> Civil Rights Leader Criticizes Supreme Court Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Supreme Court justices "should
be ashamed of themselves," Kweisi Mfume, president of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), said
Monday, pointing to rulings on anti-affirmative action issues and
a lack of minority law clerks at the high court.
</P>
<P>
"The Supreme Court finds themselves as hypocrites when they
talk of diversity," The Associated Press quoted Mfume as saying in
an address to 3,000 NAACP members attending an annual meeting.
"They make decisions on affirmative action: what people can and
can't do in this society. But they just pontificate."
</P>
<P>
Mfume said that only seven of the 397 law clerks who work for
Supreme Court justices are of black ancestry and that no American
Indian has ever served in such a position.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Chief Justice William Rehnquist turned down
a request by minority lawyers to discuss the scarcity of minority
law clerks at the Supreme Court, saying he did not think such a
meeting "would serve any useful purpose."
</P>
<P>
The National Bar Association, which represents 17,000 black
attorneys, had extended the invitation to Rehnquist on behalf of a
coalition of minority bar association leaders.
</P>
<P>
The controversy was sparked by a published report that of the
clerks hired by all nine current justices, 1 percent were
Hispanic, 2 percent were black and 4.5 percent were
Asian-American.
</P>
<P>
Supreme Court spokeswoman Toni House said the court would have
no comment on Mfume's remarks.
</P>
<P>
Mfume, who handled the day-to-day operations of the largest
civil rights group in the country, said that until the justices do
a better job of integrating their own workplace, they shouldn't
issue decisions that roll back affirmative action and thereby
create less racially diverse work settings.

<HEADLINE> GM Resumes Production at Three Assembly Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. No. 1 carmaker General
Motors Corp. resumed production at three assembly plants Monday,
as talks to end two strikes that have idled the most of GM's North
American production were stalled.
</P>
<P>
GM's chief negotiator, Vice President Gerald Knechtel, returned
to Detroit late Sunday, saying he was disappointed that weekend
talks had not resulted in a settlement as he had hoped, according
to an AP report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
However, there was a hint of progress at plant-level
negotiations. Talks lasted through Sunday night and into the early
morning hours at both plants before they were recessed. They were
to resume Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
GM had been pushing for a weekend settlement to coincide with
the end of the company's two-week summer vacation shutdown Monday.
The automaker reopened its Saturn car plant in Tennessee, its
truck plant in Oshawa, Ontario of Canada, and a small-car plant in
Ramos Arizpe, Mexico, -- the only ones unaffected so far by the
strike.
</P>
<P>
GM's 26 other major assembly plants in North America will
remain closed, along with more than 100 parts plants. In addition
to 9,200 striking workers, about 162,000 other workers have been
idled.
</P>
<P>
Losses totaled nearly 1.2 billion U.S. dollars before the
company began its previously scheduled vacation shutdown on June
29. Losses of between 75 million dollars and 80 million dollars a
day will begin piling up again Monday.

<HEADLINE> G77: U.N. Development Goals to Be Reduced Without </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
operational activities for development were designed to benefit
developing countries and should be conducted at their request in
accordance with their own policies and initiatives, Indonesia's
representative told the Economic and Social Council Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 developing countries and
China, Herijanto Soeprapto said that operational activities for
development were critically important for enabling developing
countries to take the lead in advancing and managing their own
development processes.
</P>
<P>
The representative said globalization had eroded
multilateralism and resulted in many complex and negative effects
on developing countries, and for most developing countries, the
operational activities of the United Nations had become an
important tool.
</P>
<P>
He said the Group of 77 and China attached great importance to
the triennial comprehensive policy review. It was important to
remember that operational activities were for the benefit of
developing countries and should be conducted at their request, in
accordance with their own policies ans initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the central dilemmas facing the entire development
cooperation process, he referred to the tragic shortfall between
the demands of the United Nations system for operational resources
and diminishing level of available resources.
</P>
<P>
The representative said the growing range and complexities of
the organizaition's system went far beyond what the system could
provide due to declining financial resources.
</P>
<P>
He said the proposals for arresting and reversing the decline
of core resources made by the boards of United Nations funds and
programs served as a foundation for future work.
</P>
<P>
Unless that bleak situation was turned around, there could be
no choice but to drastically reduce the goals and objectives of
the United Nations development programs, he added.
