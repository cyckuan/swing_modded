<HEADLINE> Clinton Campaigns in Michigan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today credited his policies for promoting economy in the past two
years and took a swipe at the trend of downsizing corporate work
forces to increase stock values.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was making a one-day campaign trip in Michigan, a key
Midwestern state in recent elections
</P>
<P>
At a dedication of a new City Hall in Taylor, Clinton urged
people to "really think about whether it's the fair and right
thing to do, when you see these downsizings," according to news
reports.
</P>
<P>
Clinton again called for an increase in the minimum wage,
saying workers' earnings have stagnated for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
After the speech in Taylor, Clinton spoke to more than 700
people at a 1,000-a-plate campaign luncheon in Detroit that raised
money for the Clinton-Gore '96 committee and the Democratic
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, though unchallenged in running for the Democrats'
nomination, has visited key primary states in recent weeks,
including New Hampshire, the first-in-nation primary state, and
the vote-rich California.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Iraq Confirm Oil Pipeline in Good Shape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Yumurtalik-kirkuk pipeline, the
main outlet for Iraqi oil exports, is in good shape, officials
from Turkey and Iraq said here today.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed Rashid said he had
reached Turkey through northern Iraq and saw, as he traveled
along the pipeline, that it was not damaged.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Energy Minister Sinasi Altiner said that the Turkish
portion of the twin pipeline was also in good condition.
</P>
<P>
Rashid and his ten-man delegation went to Ceyhan Monday to
examine the twin pipeline that is the main outlet of Iraqi oil
from the Kirkuk fields. He also visited the port facilities in
Ceyhan, Turkey's Mediterranean port, from which Iraqi oil had
been distributed before the pipeline was closed almost six years
ago.
</P>
<P>
"The reopening of the pipeline will be in the interests of
both Iraq and Turkey," Altiner said when meeting with his Iraqi
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Iraq has suffered substantial losses, but so has
Turkey," adding: "We do not want to inflict any damage on a
neighboring country, but we have to abide by United Nations
resolutions. I hope that the talks between Iraq and the U.N.,
which start on March 11, will have positive results."
</P>
<P>
Iraq began talks last month with the U.N. on a deal to sell 2
billion U.S. dollars worth of oil over a six-month period, on a
renewable basis, to buy food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
The first round of the talks ended two weeks ago without
agreement. A second round is scheduled for March 11 in New York.

<HEADLINE> S. African Parties Closer on Bill of Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 5 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's political
parties concerned in the constitution-writing process today moved
significantly closer to agreement on the bill of rights for the
country's final constitution.
</P>
<P>
But the parties remained deadlocked on three outstanding
issues at the end of an all-day session of the Constitutional
Assembly's (CA) streamlining negotiating committee, reported the
South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
These issues included the death penalty, the property clause
and the right to strike and lock-out, of which none were
discussed during the meeting today.
</P>
<P>
Closing the meeting late today in Cape Town, CA Chairman Cyril
Ramaphosa said he was confident parties would resolve these
matters over the next few weeks and that the new constitution
would be reached by full consensus by the May 9 deadline.
</P>
<P>
In discussion on the freedom of expression clause, the
Democratic Party (DP) softened its previously implacable
opposition to a proposed constitutional ban on "hate speech".
</P>
<P>
DP's negotiator Dene Smuts said she would take back to the DP
caucus the proposal by the African National Congress (ANC) that
advocacy of hatred based on race, ethnicity, and gender of
religion could "cause harm" and this should be explicitly banned
by the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The DP has consistently argued that "hate speech" should be
subject to ordinary legislature sanction.
</P>
<P>
National Party (NP) negotiator Sheila Camerer said the NP was
in favor of a general limitation clause in the constitution,
rather than the proposed one specifying which areas should be
excluded from freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
The CA's streamlining negotiating committee was to discuss the
crucial sections on provincial powers and the second house of
parliament on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Study: Diversified Species Raise Eco-Productivity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Researchers have found that
diversity of species could help increase ecosystem's productivity
because the species produce more biomass and retain nitrogen, the
most crucial nutrient.
</P>
<P>
The theory was drawn by a group of researchers in their study
at the Cedar Creek Natural History Area in Minnesota. The study
was published on a recent issue of the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
The researchers planted 147 plots with one to 24 native prairie
species. They have found after two years that the more species a
plot had, the greater its biomass of plants and the more nitrogen
it had taken up in its increased growth. In contrast, the fewer the
species, the sparser the growth and the greater the amount of
nitrogen leaching out of upper soil layers.
</P>
<P>
This has backed the idea of Charles Darwin more than 100 years
ago in The Origin of Species that more diverse ecosystems would
also be more productive as he found fields sown with several
grasses consistently yielded more than those with a single
species.
</P>
<P>
The new study was carried out in a grassland, but scientists
predict that the result will apply to ecosystems as different as
forests and agriculture fields, according to The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
"It shows that biological diversity does matter to the function
and sustainability of ecosystems," said Dr. Samuel McNaughton, an
ecosystem ecologist at Syracuse University, "and that has a lot of
implications for agriculture and human life."
</P>
<P>
Earlier researches had also found that biodiversity could
increase productivity. However some scientists still remain
cautious because of the difficulty of extrapolating from the
small, contrived ecosystems to the rough and tumble reality of
nature.

<HEADLINE> 73 Killed in Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Seventy-three people were
reported to have been killed by Hutu rebels in five days of
attacks in northwest Burundi, a report from the central African
state said today.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. security source was quoted as saying that eight more
people were killed in a series of ambushes in northern Burundi
last weekend as a result of increased activity by Hutu rebels in
the country, raising fear that a new wave of intense bloodshed
was starting.
</P>
<P>
This happened between February 23 and 28, said a U.N. security
source in Bujumbura who refused to be named.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. security council wants the United Nations to consult
on an intervention force in case of a sudden escalation of
killing in Burundi but it is shying away from approving such a
move.
</P>
<P>
Over 100,000 people have been killed in Burundi since Melchior
Ndadaye, the first freely-elected Hutu president in the country
was murdered in 1993.
</P>
<P>
A civil war broke out afterwards, pitting the Tutsi-dominated
army against rebels of the Hutu majority, and the battle is
mainly fought in the north.
</P>
<P>
It was said on Tuesday grenade blasts and bursts of automatic
weapons fire could be heard at nights in Bujumbura again after a
month-long period of calm that ended last month.
</P>
<P>
Fearing Burundi would descend into genocidal massacers, U.N.
chief Boutros Boutros-Ghali last month said planning should start
for an international intervention force of up to 25,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
An meeting will be held in Tunis in mid-March to discuss this
matter and the issue about 1.7 million refugees in central Africa
by Presidents of Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Zaire and Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> EU Official Concludes Visit to Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- External Affairs Commissioner of
the European Union (EU) Hans Van Den Broek left here today after
a two-day visit to the island to discuss with leaders here on
the Cyprus problem and Cyprus' EU accession bid.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before his departure, the Dutch commissioner expressed
EU's willingness to assist U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-
Ghali to reach a settlement in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He said there is no difference in the ambitions between the
Greek and Turkish Cypriots concerning the island's accession to
the EU.
</P>
<P>
But "there is difference of opinion about who is lacking
political will," he said, adding that this should be solved in the
course of the process and "encouragement from the outside" could
also assist in this direction.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner also stressed that Turkey's customs union
with the EU was important for the union in the hope that it would
bring about an atmosphere of cooperation and also assist efforts
toward a solution to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that a solution will be achieved before the
Cyprus-EU accession negotiations start.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, divided since the 1974 Turkish invasion, applied for
EU full membership in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The EU Council of Ministers decided on March 6, 1995 to start
accession talks with Cyprus six months after end of the EU 1996
Intergovernmental Conference.
</P>
<P>
Van Den Broek, who arrived here Monday, had separate talks
today with President Glafcos Clerides and Foreign Minister Alecos
Michaelides.
</P>
<P>
He also addressed a joint meeting of the EU-Cyprus
parliamentary committee, which concluded its two-day deliberations
today.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Van Den Broek called on all interested
parties, including the U.N., the EU and the U.S., to join forces
and help reach a settlement in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He said the EU has a special responsibility to help solve the
Cyprus problem on the basis of a bizonal, bicommunal federation.
</P>
<P>
On the prospects of Cyprus' EU accession, Van Den Broek said
"Cyprus' accession without an agreed solution is possible but not
preferable."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the EU is convinced that "prospects of
Cyprus' accession to the EU will contribute to peace and
reconciliation on the island."

<HEADLINE> ANC, IFP Express Fears About Lawlessness In Kwazulu/Natal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 5 (Xinhua)-- Both the African National
Congress (ANC) and the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) have expressed
fears that increasing lawlessness in the rural areas of
Kwazulu/Natal might develop into a blood-bath during the
forthcoming local government elections in the province.
</P>
<P>
Kwazulu/Natal's local government elections are scheduled to
take place on May 29 this year.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from both parties today said law enforcement had made
little impression on a number of politically volatile communities
in the province, such as Babanango in the north and Impendle in
the midlands.
</P>
<P>
IFP spokesman Ed Tillett said the problem was linked to ANC
attempts to undermine "traditional structures" in many rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
Tillett said: "The pattern of lawlessness seems to correspond
to areas where the ANC is preparing to establish a foothold. And
you don't find the same levels of violence where traditional
structures are still in place."
</P>
<P>
IFP supporters in Kwazulu/Natal claimed the anc implemented a
covert plan to systematically eliminate IFP leaders to create an
IFP leadership vacuum in the local elections.
</P>
<P>
The IFP claims that at least 430 of its leaders have been
killed over the past ten years.
</P>
<P>
However, ANC Provincial Secretary Senzo Mchunu dismissed the
IFP allegations, saying the lawlessness in the rural areas
stemmed largely from the political affiliation of local chiefs.
</P>
<P>
Mchunu said virtually all chiefs in the rural areas were IFP
leaders and people living in those areas were presumed to be IFP
supporters.
</P>
<P>
"We are very concerned about the insecurity of people in rural
areas. There is a total disregard for law and order and a state
of lawlessness is clearly growing," he added.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the political violence in Kwazulu/Natal
between ANC and IFP supporters had claimed about 20,000 lives in
the past few years. enditem

<HEADLINE> 17 Iranians Protest Rejection of Candidacy for Parliament Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 5 (Xinhua) -- A group of 17 men today protested
to the conservative Guardians Council about its rejection of their
candidacy for Parliamentary elections slated for March 8.
</P>
<P>
A well-informed source told Xinhua that these people have
sat-in in front of Guardians Council's building for 48 hours in
protest against the rejection.
</P>
<P>
The source said they came from Iran's northern province of
Ardebil and demanded reconsideration of their candidacy from the
Guardians Council, which is composed of high-ranking clergies.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, no responsible official came out to talk
with the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
The group from Ardebil province is among over 2,000 people
whose candidacies were rejected by the Guardians Council.
</P>
<P>
According to an official report, over two fifths of candidates
for the upcoming parliamentary elections were rejected by the
Guardians Council controlled by rightist hardliners.
</P>
<P>
The Guardians Council is the final authority that oversees the
election of Iran's fifth parliamentary elections since Islamic
Revolution of 1979.
</P>
<P>
The council and its supervisory boards have come under fire by
many grassroots organizations. The critics allege that Guardians
Council is not free from its own sectarian tendencies.

<HEADLINE> Rifkind to Outline UK Foreign-Security Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Malcolm
Rifkind was to set out Britain's views on the European Union's
Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) before the forthcoming
Inter-Governmental Conference.
</P>
<P>
The Inter-Governmental Conference (IGC), due to be held in
Turin, Italy later this month, was expected to review the
Maastricht Treaty and the Common Foreign and Security Policy
(CFSP) will be high on the agenda of the IGC conference.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind, who is to deliver a speech later today, is expected to
attach great significance to national interests in foreign policy,
saying "it is the guiding spirit of our diplomacy."
</P>
<P>
"The first task for our diplomats in the European Union (EU) is
to identify our common interests," but the common policy will only
succeed when it "acts with grain of our national interests and
perceptions", according to a copy of his speech.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind was to contend that "we should see Common Foreign and
Security Policy as a complement to our national foreign policies,
an increasingly robust complement, but not a replacement."
</P>
<P>
In addition, he is to point out that "CFSP is not and never
will be the only means for nations to pursue their goals" and they
should promote their interests through the United Nations, the G7,
NATO and other international institutions."
</P>
<P>
As the current presidency state of the Western European Union
(WEU), Rifkind said that Britain would work together with it
European partners to make WEU more operational as soon as possible
to shoulder more responsibilities of European defense.
</P>
<P>
However, Britain was strongly opposed to making WEU subordinate
to the EU, he said, adding if the EU had a defense role, the
Russians would no longer support EU's enlargement to the East.
</P>
<P>
"It is in nobody's interests to inject new elements of
uncertainty into the already delicate process of enlarging the
European Union to the East," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the possible extension of the qualified majority voting at
the ICG conference, he said majority voting is not the way to make
policy decisions in Common Foreign and Security policy.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind was in favor of the idea of "constructive abstention"
which means no EU member state would be obliged to provide
national forces for joint European military actions.

<HEADLINE> Foreigners Concerned about Mandela's Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investors and
politicians are concerned about South Africa's future after
President Nelson Mandela left office whatever Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki might have to say, Deputy President F. W. de Klerk's
office said today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Cape Town, de Klerk's adviser,
National Party (NP) senator Nick Koornhof said Mbeki was out of
touch when he claimed that only South Africans are concerned
about what would happen once Mandela left the political stage.
</P>
<P>
Koornhof said: "nearly all the foreign businessmen,
industrialists and politicians who have visited Deputy President
de Klerk are concerned about the 'after-Mandela' era."
</P>
<P>
Mbeki's "off target and naive" comments would merely upset
foreigners further, especially as he was a strong candidate to
succeed Mandela as president, said Koornhof.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the NP also wished the president all the best while
he is having his medical check-up and hoped that the results
would be reassuring.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony of an agreement on the
avoidance of double taxation with Austria in Cape Town Monday,
Mbeki dismissed reports that foreign investors were jittery about
Mandela's ill-health, and that this was affecting foreign
investment in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said: "the matter is raised in South Africa rather than the
rest of the world. It's a very South African thing."
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Mandela was admitted to Johannesburg's
Park Lane Clinic to undergo his most comprehensive check-up to
date aimed at ending speculation about his ill-health.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the clinic, Mandela dismissed
speculation of his early retirement without completing his
five-year term, but said he would definitely step down in 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 5 (Xinhua)-- Zambian Minister of Environment and
Natural Resources William Harrington today stressed importance of
protecting forests in the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a donor meeting on Zambia forestry here,
Harrington said that assisted by the Dutch government and the
United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the
Zambian government had worked out the forestry action program
(ZFAP) to deal with deforestation.
</P>
<P>
The program would develop a strategic framework for protection
of the Zambian forests, he said.
</P>
<P>
About 61 percent of the Zambian land was covered by indigenous
forests or woodland and only 15.2 percent of the total territory
was covered by gazetted forests and national parks, he said.
</P>
<P>
The wooded areas were being subjected to pressure of cutting
mainly for charcoal and agricultural expansion and this pressure
was also experienced in gazetted forests through illegal cutting
and settlement, he added.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Zambia's forests are being cut down at a
rate of some 200,000 hectares every year. enditem

<HEADLINE> First Meeting Of African Regional Bureau Of Women Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The first meeting of the
African Regional Bureau of Women, set up during the Beijing
Fourth World Conference On Women, ended here today, urging
African leaders to push the implementation of the platforms of
action.
</P>
<P>
A report passed at the five-day meeting recommended that the
Bureau of the Fifth Regional Conference on Women secure the
commitment of African leaders attending the forthcoming summit of
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to the implementation of
the platforms.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that it is more strategic to set a
political agenda at the regional level with specific goals which
african governments must achieve within specific time frames.
</P>
<P>
It said, "National machineries should play a strong advisory
and monitoring role in the implementation of the platforms of
action. They should be substantially strengthened financially and
technically to play this role effectively."
</P>
<P>
It also urged the OAU and the Economic Commission for Africa
(ECA) to play a strong coordination and catalytic role in the
implementation of the platforms for action.
</P>
<P>
The meeting appealed to the ECA in its report to "establish a
data bank on women, gender and development on national
experiences and disseminate the information so that experiences
can be shared and where necessary replicated."
</P>
<P>
The meeting unanimously agreed that post-Beijing meetings were
important and strongly recommended that a coordinating mechanism
on post-Beijing meetings be established.
</P>
<P>
Two meetings have been planned in the region, namely Kampala
Post-Beijing Regional Conference to be hosted by the Ugandan
government in September 1996 and Accra Post-Beijing Regional
Meeting to be hosted by the Ghanaian government.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 5 (Xinhua)-- South African President
Nelson Mandela today condemned "in the strongest terms" two
recent bomb blasts claiming 38 lives in Israeli cities of
Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at Johannesburg's Park Lane Clinic,
where he is undergoing a three-day medical check-up, Mandela said
violence did not help to solve any problems.
</P>
<P>
A Muslim suicide-bomber on Monday killed 20 people, including
three South Africans, and wounded 78 others outside a Tel Aviv
shopping centre. On Sunday another suicide-bomber killed 18
people on a bus in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas claimed responsibility
for both bombings.
</P>
<P>
When asked if he would meet members of the Hamas Islamic
fundamentalist group if they visited South Africa, Mandela
replied that he was not aware of any such visit.
</P>
<P>
"But my attention is to see everybody who wants to see me
whether I agree with his policy or not," said the president,
adding "It sometimes helps because I am able to state my policy
to them and let them defend their own policy if they can."
</P>
<P>
Mandela stressed that South Africa, with a past dominated by
tensions and conflict, had shown that talking could solve
problems.
</P>
<P>
"I have grown to detest any form of violence such as this bomb
attack, there is no reason whatsoever why we should resort to
violence," he added.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Involvement in Israeli Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Ministry today
denied any involvement in the bomb blast in Israel, terming the
allegation of its involvement as the continuation of a campaign
against the Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Javad Zarif, Deputy Foreign Minister for International
Affairs, said it "is again the usual continuation of a campaign
against Iran."
</P>
<P>
"Anything like this happens anywhere, the United States and
Israeli try to attribute bombing and anything to Iran," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian deputy foreign minister declared once again that
Iran had nothing to do with the bombing.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted, Iran just morally supports the Hamas
Freedom Movement Organization in Palestine. But it is not
involved anyway in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Iran's permanent mission to the U.N.
considers a statement made to the press by the Israeli
representative to the U.N. "irresponsible and inflammatory"
against Iran.
</P>
<P>
"His allegations that Iran supplies Palestinian groups with
financial resources, arms and training facilities are absolutely
false and the permanent mission of the Islamic Republic of
Iran categorically rejects them," it stressed in a statement.
</P>
<P>
His baseless allegations against Iran is designed to deflect
attention from Israeli practices, the true cause of their
problems, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli representative to the United Nations, in an
interview with reporters Monday morning, accused Iran of being
responsible for supporting, supplying and training Jihad forces
in the occupied lands.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Evelyn Hone College Closes Indefinitely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 5 (Xinhua)-- A Zambian minister announced today
that Evelyn Hone College in Lusaka has been indefinitely closed
due to students continued boycott of classes.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Science, Technology and Vocational Training
Kabunda Kayongo said in a statement that the college had been
closed because the authorities and the students were not getting
anywhere in resolving the class boycott.
</P>
<P>
The students began the boycott and demonstrations more than
10 days ago, demanding introduction of a bursary scheme which
was promised by the government last year.
</P>
<P>
It seemed that measures put in place had been frustrated by
some student leaders who had a hidden agenda and were bent on
bringing confusion between the authorities and the students,
Kayongo stressed.
</P>
<P>
The closure of the college followed the students' refusal to
fill in printed forms that demanded them to abide by the college
regulations, she revealed.
</P>
<P>
She said some students demanded the release of their leader
Azwell Zulu from police cells before they could fill in the
forms.
</P>
<P>
After carrying repairs on the college property damaged during
the boycott, her ministry would devise a way to deal with each
student over a bursary scheme and food to control mob psychology
that led to rioting, she said.
</P>
<P>
Zambian students enjoy free food in secondary schools,
colleges and universities once they pay some tuition fees.

<P>
LUSAKA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Privatization Agency (ZPA)
has raised about 30 million US dollars from the sale of 125
state-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing here today, ZPA technical director Stuart
Cruinkshank said the money had been banked in the privatization
revenue account under the Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
Stuart said ZPA borrowed 9 million dollars from the earnings
to pay off the retrenches and the money would be re-imbursed
after the sale of some assets.
</P>
<P>
ZPA had put in place stringent measures to stop unscrupulous
people from buying parastatals' assets cheaply, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He added ZPA had appointed a team of experts to assess the
value of all assets of the parastatals to ensure that they were
not undervalued before they could be sold to companies and
individuals.
</P>
<P>
ZPA was also working closely with the trade union leaders to
stop some people from stripping companies before they would be
sold through public tender, he said.
</P>
<P>
About 250 state-owned companies in Zambia have been lined up
for sale under the privatization program.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government today
strongly denounced a wave of suicide bombings in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides said at a daily
press briefing that the Cyprus government was repelled by these
attacks which have killed dozens of innocent persons. He expressed

<HEADLINE> Contradictory Claims Over Seizure of Dolow In Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 5 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for a Marehan
political organization-- Somali National Front (SNF), has denied
today that the militiamen of General Mohamed Farah Aidid had
captured the border town of Dolow.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Mohamed Eid Elmi, said General Aidid's
militiamen were ambushed by his SNF clansmen before they arrived
Dolow, a strategic town bordering Ethiopia, adding that Aidid's
men had launched their attack from Huddur.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that dozens of his militiamen were killed or
wounded while Aidid's men were forced to retreat back to Huddur
with heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
Elmi said Dolow town is now calm under the full control of
militiamen from the Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA)and those of
SNF from the neighboring town of Bulohawa, 45 km south of Dolow.
</P>
<P>
He threatened that his forces will give a good lesson to what
he called Aidid's mercenaries if they attempt to jeopardize the
security of Dolow and the rest of Gedo region. Gedo region is
where the late dictator, Mohamed Siad Barre was born.
</P>
<P>
Despite Elmi's denials, officials of General Aidid's
government are still insisting that Dolow remains under the
control of their militiamen.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the contradictory statements given by the opposing
sides over the Dolow issue, a local newspaper had also carried
the story of General Aidid's seizure of Dolow.
</P>
<P>
However, Elmi had accused the local papers for siding with
General Aidid and making publicity for his aggression, and
appealed the papers to be neutral on the current political and
clannish conflicts in the country.
</P>
<P>
And independent sources from the field radios in Dolow also
confirmed the occupation of General Aidid in the town.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that some of the RRA forces have crossed the
border to Ethiopia while other stranded ones keep hiding in the
jungles to reorganize for guerrilla fighting against the South
Mogadishu government forces led by General Mohamed Farah Aidid
who crowned himself president in mid June last year.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Armed Wing Makes New Cease-fire Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The armed wing of Hamas,
the Izzedine al-Qassam units, today issued its second leaflet
in five days offering Israel a temporary cease fire,
according to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian press service
based in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The leaflet stated: "We fully respect and abide by the
call of the movement's political leadership to stop all armed
attacks against 'Israel.'"
</P>
<P>
"We call upon all acting military wings and armed units
throughout the homeland which fall under the Qassam's units'
banner to immediately stop all suicide attacks against Jews and
to fully abide by the central decisions made by Qassam Units'
leadership," it said.
</P>
<P>
"We allow all our active armed units in the areas falling under
Zionist military rule in the West Bank -- which is being
subjected to collective punishments and being burned by Zionist
oppression -- to defend themselves and our cities, villages and
people in light of the vicious Zionist attack," it added.
</P>
<P>
It proposes that the units halt all armed attacks until the
beginning of July as part of a limited, renewable cease-fire in
order to provide a suitable environment of tranquility and
stability in the region to reach a just cease fire between Hamas
and the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
"This period will prevent the continuation of mutual violence
and plant the seeds of tranquility and stability in the region,"
it noted.
</P>
<P>
The leaflet does not mention the Yehiya Ayyash units, which
claim to be part of the Izzedine al-Qassam Units and have declared
responsibility for the attacks of the past two Sundays.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Worsening Relations between Baku,  Tehran  (by Chen Ming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Iranian foreign minister's recent
trip to neighboring country of Azerbaijan has not helped but
worsened relations between Tehran and Baku, the two littoral
states of the oil-rich Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
An unexpected development took place in Baku Sunday. Iranian
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati traded angry remarks with his
host Hasan Hasanov during a press conference regardless of any
diplomatic protocol.
</P>
<P>
The dispute was over Iran's relations with the Armenian
Republic and Azerbaijan's relations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati criticized Azeri
official for having close ties with "the main enemy of Moslems,
Israel."
</P>
<P>
Azeri Foreign Minister Hasan Hasanov criticized Iran for having
friendly ties with Armenia despite the Armenian occupation of
Nagorno-Karabakh enclave in Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
"In my view Iran's relations with Armenia should be of more
concern to the Iranian people. Armenia, and not Israel, has
occupied the Azeri soil," said Hasanov.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, today's English daily Iran News attacked Azerbaijan
Republic for moving too close to Israel, saying that Iran
would not tolerate Israeli presence near its northern borders.
</P>
<P>
The daily in an editorial called on Baku to revise its policy
of having friendly relations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"It is better for the Azeri leadership to revise its policies
towards Israel to serve the interests of the regions as a whole,"
it said.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the relations between the two countries have
deteriorated since Azerbaijan canceled out Iran's share in an
oil consortium formed to develop Azeri oil in the Caspian Sea one
year ago.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian authorities felt insulted by the Azeri move to
kick Iran out from the giant oil development program in the
Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
However, Tehran has charged that the cancellation of Iran's 5
percent share in the consortium was done through the
U.S. pressure. Iran's share was given to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan and Iran enjoyed close relations during the height
of Nagorno-Karabakh crisis in 1993. Iranian humanitarian
assistance was given to the war refugees in Azerbaijan. Tehran
intervened more than once in order to mediate between Azerbaijan
and Armenia.
</P>
<P>
As a result of Iranian support for Azeri territorial
integrity, Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani was accorded
a warm welcome in Baku during his trip November 1993.
</P>
<P>
After Azerbaijan canceled Iran's membership in the oil
consortium in March, 1995, Tehran began moving closer to Moscow
which opposed the consortium from the beginning because it
included Western companies, including U.S. oil companies.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Russia have consistently called for the definition of
the legal regime of the Caspian Sea. Both Tehran and Moscow have
maintained that Baku has no right to develop the oil reserves that
belong to all the Caspian Sea littoral states.
</P>
<P>
Iran has also strengthened its ties with Armenia since Azeri
cancellation of the Iranian share in the consortium.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the two country's relations are also
influenced by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
A political science professor at Azad University who spoke on
condition of anonymity said that Iran and Turkey were trying to
eliminate each other's influence not only in Azerbaijan but also
in all the countries in Central Asia and the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
"Iran wants to play the role of the link between these
countries, most of them landlocked states, to the open seas. It
also wants to influence their politics so they would allow more
room for Islamic activism," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Turkey on the other hand was committed to
establish ties with these countries "both for racial reasons,
because the people in Central Asia and the Caucasus are all of
Turkic origin."
</P>
<P>
Last week a commentary on Turkish Radio monitored here
admitted that a rivalry existed between Iran and Turkey. The
commentary said that Turkey, as opposed to "fundamentalist Iran,"
was a better model for these countries because it was both
secular and had a powerful private sector.

<HEADLINE> 0.8 Million Zimbabweans Lost Jobs In Past Five Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 5 (Xinhua) -- About 800,000 Zimbabweans have
lost their jobs since the country launched free market reforms
more than five years ago, a local economist said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Economist Eric Bloch said that despite claims of new
investment coming into Zimbabwe, less than 100,000 new jobs had
been created since 1991.
</P>
<P>
Bloch warned that many jobs could be on the line unless the
government slashed its debt burden.
</P>
<P>
At present Zimbabwe has a national debt of about 4.1 billion
U.S. Dollars projected to climb 18 percent to 4.8 billion U.S.
Dollars by the end of the 1994/95 fiscal year in June, he said.
</P>
<P>
''The Zimbabwean economy now suffers from a domino syndrome.
The result is that we have put more people than intended out of
jobs,'' Bloch said.
</P>
<P>
The majority of jobs were lost in the clothing, textiles and
leather sectors, he said.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 200,000 school leavers joined the job market each
year but less than 30,000 are absorbed, according to the
government statistics.
</P>
<P>
Bloch said if the government controlled spending, it would
lower the national debt that would enable the Reserve Bank of
Zimbabwe to relax its tight monetary policy and facilitate
economic activity and job creation.

<HEADLINE> Clarke: Feel-good Factor Is on Its Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Kenneth Clarke, the British
Chancellor of the Exchequer, Monday defied scepticism about his
forecasts for UK economic growth, saying that the economy was on
target for "another very good year".
</P>
<P>
In spite of claims by City analysts that his budget forecast of
three percent growth was over-optimistic, Clarke told MPs that the
economy would "defy its detractors".
</P>
<P>
In a Commons debate initiated by the government, Clarke said
that prospects for business investment had "never been better".
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending would be "the main source of growth this
year", with signs of a "tentative upward trend" in the housing
market and a sharp boost in the amount of money feeding into the
economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Clarke added: "1996 will be the year when the ordinary citizen
will at last begin to feel the real benefits of healthy economic
recovery on his or her family finances".
</P>
<P>
This was because the tax cuts announced in last November's
budget are due to take effect next month, the mortgage payment for
the average borrower was around 150 pounds (228 US dollars) a
month less than it was in 1990, and many people would benefit from
payouts as building societies turned themselves into banks.
</P>
<P>
His remarks fuelled expectations of another cut in interest
rates this week when he and Eddie George, the governor of the Bank
of England, meet on Thursday to hold their monthly monetary
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Trade Unions to Continue Dialogue with Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese General Workers
Confederation (GWC) leadership today agreed to continue a dialogue
with the government, but threatened to stage strike and
demonstrations if their demands are not met.
</P>
<P>
The GWC's Executive Committee, in an emergency meeting today,
endorsed a recommendation to hold a two-day general strike and
demonstrations all over the country before the end of this month
if the government, "by means of dialogue," fails to meet the
workers' demands.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at the end of the meeting, the GWC's
Executive Committee also repeated its call on the government to
repeal, as soon as possible, a two-year-old ban on
demonstrations, and a decision to entrust the army to keep the
public security and order.
</P>
<P>
It was the first emergency meeting of the Executive Committee
called by President of the GWC Elias Abu Rizk after the
government successfully thwarted the GWC plan to stage
nation-wide demonstrations at the end of last month.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the demonstrations, the government authorized the
army to enforce the demonstration ban in major cities of the
country and to take the responsibilities of maintain the law
and order for three months.
</P>
<P>
In an accordance to the government decision, the army
imposed a curfew on February 29, forcing the powerful GWC to
cancel its decision to take to the street on that day. The
curfew was lifted 11 hours later.
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the GWC demands a 76 percent wage rise and
a double of the present minimum salary level of 250,000 Lebanese
pounds (156 dollars).
</P>
<P>
And the GWC is also demanding a cancellation of the
government ban on demonstrations and a reconsideration of a
government decision to limit the number of private TV and
radio stations.

<HEADLINE> Boueiz Hopes for Stop of Violence in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Commenting on the fourth suicide
bombing in Israel in eight days, Lebanese Foreign Minister Fares
Boueiz hoped here today for a stop of the spate of violence in the
Jewish state in order not to hinder the way to the comprehensive
and just peace.
</P>
<P>
Warning against possible revenges by extremist Jewish groups,
the foreign minister said: "we hope that these operations (of
violence) will not give justifications and reasons to some owners
of extremist currents in Israel to destroy the peace process."
</P>
<P>
But he also expressed a fear that the recent events in Israel
will divert the attention from the violence practiced by peace in
South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"We can not deal with one of the sides of the violence in the
region and ignore the violence and terror also practiced by Israel
against its neighbors, especially against South Lebanon," Boueiz
underlined.
</P>
<P>
On the suspension of the peace negotiations between Israel and
Syria, Boueiz pointed out that he did not see a chance to reach a
decisive agreement before the Israeli general elections in May and
"the negotiations continue only for the continuity."
</P>
<P>
"Anyway," the foreign minister said, "now that the Israeli
elections had been put forward, there is not a real horizon for
the negotiations to reach a crucial decision."
</P>
<P>
"And the negotiations continue only for its continuity," he
added, "and they continue also in a bid to try to crystalize the
ideas previously raised."
</P>
<P>
But he expressed a hope that the negotiations will be resumed
as early as possible to "close the road before those who are
attempting to split the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Following a series of suicide bombings in the Jewish state in the
past two weeks, Israel ordered Monday its negotiators to the peace
talks with Syria to return home, saying that the time now was not
appropriate for negotiations.

<HEADLINE> ILO: Unemployment Not to Down in Most Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment is expected to remain
unchanged or rise slowly in most countries, according to the
latest report on unemployment situation issued by the
International Labour Organization (ILO).
</P>
<P>
"Official unemployment figures are stabilizing at high rates or
improving very slowly in a number of countries," it said in a
press release issued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Double-digit unemployment continues to prevail in most Western
European countries. The latest data showed unemployment in rise in
Austria, Germany and France.
</P>
<P>
Between 1994 and 1995, unemployment rose slightly in Austria,
Belgium, Luxembourg, Portugal and Sweden, while decreasing from
high levels in Finland, Ireland, Italy and Spain.
</P>
<P>
Over the same period, joblessness moved downward in Denmark,
the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The trend was also seen in
Iceland, Norway and Switzerland, where unemployment is
comparatively low.
</P>
<P>
Among the Central European transition economies, lowest rate of
registered unemployment was reported in the Czech Republic, at 3.0
percent in last September, down from 3.2 percent year on year. A
decline was also registered in Hungary and Poland.
</P>
<P>
Among the larger industrialized economies, Japan continues to
enjoy the lowest overall unemployment, but the rate in December
1995 had edged up to 3.2 percent from 2.7 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Over the same period, the United States unemployment rose from
5.1 percent to 5.3 percent, with a jump to 5.8 percent by January
1996.
</P>
<P>
Canada saw a drop in unemployment from double digits in early
1994 to 9.2 percent by the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The ILO said that unemployment continues to be low in a small
number of South- and South-East Asian countries and regions,
notably Hong Kong, Malaysia, South Korea and Singapore, despite
significant percentage increases for the region.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, unemployment crept upward from 1.6 percent in the
second quarter of 1994 to 2.9 percent a year later. Unemployment
slightly increased in Singapore, while remained low in South Korea
at around 2 percent in 1994-95 and declined in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
In India, the number of registered unemployed rose by about
one-half a million, with the jobless rate up to 37.2 percent in
August 1995 from 36.8 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
In Australia, unemployment continued a downward trend from 1994
to drop from double digits to 8.5 percent in December 1995.
Reduction in unemployment also continued in New Zealand, with an
official unemployment rate going from 7.7 percent in the second
quarter of 1994 to 6.0 percent a year after.
</P>
<P>
In Latin America, unemployment increased in Brazil to 5.1
percent in the third quarter of 1995, compared to 4.5 percent a
year earlier. Over the same period, the jobless rate increased
from 7.6 percent to 8.7 percent in Colombia and fell by one
percent to 5.7 percent in Chile.
</P>
<P>
According to the ILO, limited available data showed
unemployment in rise in Africa. In addition, underemployment and
unemployment are acute across the continent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Factory Orders Up 0.5 Percent in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. factory orders rose 0.5
percent in January, the second consecutive advance, U.S. Commerce
Department reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said orders for both durable and
non-durable goods totaled a seasonally adjusted 311.1 billion U.S.
dollars, up from a revised 309.5 billion dollars in December.
</P>
<P>
The department revised the December's factory orders report. In
December, U.S. factory orders increased 1.7 percent, stronger than
the 1.3 percent initial estimate. Orders in 1995 were up by 6.7
percent, one-tenth of a percentage point higher than the figure
announced last month.
</P>
<P>
Factory orders are considered a key gauge of the nation's
manufacturing health. The December advance had been the first in
three months and the advance in 1995 was much slower compared to a
10.3 percent gain in 1994.
</P>
<P>
A survey of U.S. purchasing executives earlier suggested that
manufacturing, including factory orders, may have weakened in
February but it said that the seven-month decline had slowed.
</P>
<P>
In January, orders for durable goods--products such as aircraft
and automobiles expected to last more than three years-- rose 0.2
percent after a revised 3.1 percent gain in December. Orders for
non-durable goods rose 0.8 percent following a 0.2 percent
increase a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
The backlog of unfilled orders rose 1.7 percent, the fifth
straight monthly increase. It was the largest increase since a 1.7
percent gain in December 1989. A growing backlog indicates
businesses may be pressed to keep up with demand, resulting in
more jobs and longer production lines.
</P>
<P>
Inventories, another sign of future activity, increased 0.7
percent after rising 0.2 percent in December. That resulted in a
1.39 inventories-to-shipments ratio, up from 1.37 the previous
month and meaning it would take 1.39 months to exhaust stockpiles
at the January sales pace.
</P>
<P>
Shipments, a measure of current production, fell 0.9 percent,
the first decline since October. They had risen 0.7 percent in
December.

<HEADLINE> Greek Unions, Employers Strike Wage Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The General Confederation of Workers
of Greece (GSEE) today approved an agreement on wage rises reached
on Sunday with employers.
</P>
<P>
GSEE President Christos Protopappas said that the agreement,
approved by the confederations's presidium by 22 votes to 12,
meant net wage increases of 3 percent after taking into account
of inflation.
</P>
<P>
He also described the agreement as "the most successful
attained by GSEE in the last ten years".
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the agreement, the lowest daily wage will
be increased from the present 5,333 drachmas (about 23 U.S.
dollars) to 5,525 drachmas (about 24 U.S. dollars) as of January
1, 1996 and to 5746 drachmas (about 25 U.S. dollars) as of July 1,
1996.
</P>
<P>
An increase equal to the rate of inflation plus 2 percent is
foreseen for 1997, to be paid in two equal amounts.

<HEADLINE> US, Europe to Share Nato Military Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States and its European
Nato allies have reached an agreement allowing the latter to run
their own peacekeeping and security missions in Europe, it was
reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, air support, satellite intelligence and up
to 70,000 combat troops including American technical experts can
be made available for operations run by the Western European Union
and commanded by European generals.
</P>
<P>
The United States will also allow Nato facilities to be used in
some security missions run by purely national European
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
In return, the European allies will have to seek Nato approval
for all military operations involving alliance resources.
</P>
<P>
This signals that Washington is ready to relinquish its direct
control of Nato's military firepower and let the European allies
to take greater responsibility for peacekeeping in the region.
</P>
<P>
Throughout Nato's history, the US has provided its supreme
military commander and insisted on direct control of its armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
The agreement comes on the eve of the European Union's review
of the Maastricht Treaty later this month, during which the
member states will debate what role, if any, the EU should have
in security and defence, and whether the WEU should eventually be
incorporated into the EU.
</P>
<P>
It also follows France's decision last year to work more
closely with Nato's integrated military command, which, according
to a Nato source, has led the Americans to believe that France was
not trying to push them out of Europe by building a so-called
European defence identity.
</P>
<P>
In future European security missions, Nato troops could fight
alongside the Eurocorps -- which France sees as the embryo of a
European army and which already has French, German, Belgian and
Spanish units.

STOCKHOLM, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Swedish Supreme Commander Owe

<P>
Wiktorin said that if the defense cut was approved, Sweden
would only be able to stand minor attacks in very limited areas.

<P>
The Swedish government has changed its defense strategy after
it decided that the country was facing "fewer and smaller"
potential threats in the post-Cold War era.
</P>

But it said the armed forces should be prepared to react

<HEADLINE> Japanese Women Unhappy with Homemaker Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Japanese women are fighting hard to
shed their stereotyped roles as homemakers nowadays, though men
have devoted much more of their time to domestic chores than
before, a government white paper reported.
</P>
<P>
The report, the eighth of its kind since 1978, chronicles the
advances made in women's status over the past 50 years since the
end of World War Two.
</P>
<P>
The report said Japanese women are no longer content with their
traditional role as mere homemakers and went out for work more
frequently, while men are beginning to set aside a little more
time for housework than before.
</P>
<P>
These new gender roles are a halfway departure from the
traditional model that "A man's place is at work and that of a
woman at home," according to the government report.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, 36.6 percent of women answering a Prime Minister's
Office survey supported the traditional role model and 31.9
percent did not. In 1995, 22.3 percent of female respondents
backed it and 53.9 percent did not.
</P>
<P>
As for men, 51.7 percent agreed with the gender model and 20.2
percent did not in 1987, compared with the 32.9 percent positive
answers and 40.2 percent negative ones in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Japanese men have come to participate in homemaking at
weekends, with the time increasing from 25 minutes to 46 minutes
on Saturdays and from 51 minutes to 76 minutes on Sundays during
the 20 years, an apparent result of the institution of five-day
workweek system.
</P>
<P>
The change in gender roles reflects women's greater involvement
in public work. But the report noted that women are still playing
a limited role in the decision-making process in Japanese society
and therefore they have a long way to go to achieve real equality
with men.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Banks to Help Liquidate "Jusen" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Japanese banks will accept the
ruling coalition's request to pay an additional 500 billion yen (5
billion U.S. dollars) to help liquidate seven debt-ridden housing
loan companies, or "Jusen," Kyodo News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The banks, including major commercial banks, long-term credit
banks, trust banks and regional banks, will jointly pay the 500
billion yen in the form of additional corporate tax payments over
the next seven years, Kyodo quoted banking industry sources as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The tax will be paid out of a 1.5 trillion yen (15 billion
dollars) additional revenue which the banks would raise through
expanded rationalization program to be devised by each bank by the
end of this month, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
The banks, which founded the "Jusen," originally planned to
bear a total of 3.5 trillion yen (35 billion dollars) in costs.
</P>
<P>
The government convinced the banks to pay the extra cost in a
bid to win public support for a plan to spend 685 billion yen
(6.85 billion dollars) in taxpayers' money and to pave the way for
parliamentary passage of the 1996 fiscal budget that includes the
outlay.
</P>
<P>
However, the leading opposition party Shinshinto (New Frontier
Party) carried out a sit-in at the Diet (parliament) to block
voting on the budget in the House of Representatives' Budget
Committee.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Government Agrees on Additional "Jusen" Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Japan's three-party ruling coalition
agreed today to increase contributions from financial institutions
in the liquidation of seven insolvent housing loan companies,
known as "jusen."
</P>
<P>
The government accepted a package of additional measures in the
liquidation of "jusen" worked out by the three ruling parties --
the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the Social Democratic Party
(SDP) and New Party Sakigake.
</P>
<P>
The measures aim to eventually compensate for the planned use
of 685 billion yen (6.85 billion U.S. dollars) in taxpayers' money
in the fiscal year 1996, beginning on April 1, Deputy Chief
Cabinet Secretary Kazo Watanabe told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The latest plan urged jusen founder banks and
agricultural-related financial institutions -- big lenders to the
mortgage firms -- to contribute more to the write-off scheme.
</P>
<P>
These founder banks and farm institutions will be asked to
restructure their organizations and streamline their management in
order to create more than 2 trillion yen (20 billion dollars) in
profit over seven years, with a total of about 680 billion yen
(6.80 billion dollars) going to the state in the form of increased
corporate taxes.
</P>
<P>
Leaders and executives from the three governing parties, after
reaching the accord in a meeting this afternoon, also confirmed
their determination to win the swift passage of the 75.1 trillion
yen (751 billion dollars) fiscal 1996 budget through the House of
Representatives, including the use of 685 billion yen for jusen,
Watanabe said.
</P>
<P>
The new measures also call for restricting the practice of
allowing high-ranking Finance Ministry officials to take top posts
in private companies they once regulated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, members of the main opposition Shinshinto (New
Frontier Party) continued to block the two entrances to the lower
house's Budget Committee room as they had done since Monday
morning, preventing the panel from convening and voting on the
draft budget.
</P>
<P>
Takashi Yonezawa, secretary general of Shinshinto, said the
coalition's additional measures are "an attempt to deceive the
people."
</P>
<P>
Kosuke Uehara, chairman of the Budget Committee, met Speaker
Takako Doi in the morning to try to get Diet (parliament) business
back to a normal state.
</P>
<P>
Doi turned down a suggestion from some coalition lawmakers that
the scores of Shinshinto legislators blocking entry to the
committee room should be removed by Diet guards, urging the
coalitions to continue efforts to break the impasse through
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Outside the Diet building, citizens' groups and labor union
members were staging a sit-in protest against the planned use of
taxpayers' money for the liquidation scheme.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai Banks See Heavy Loads after Four-day  Weekend  (by Xiong Ping) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Thai banks have to cope with heavy
loads Monday after a four-day weekend and some trouble seemed to
surface in their operations.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand's check clearing system failed to cope
with the heavy loads and all commercial banks were forced to stop
lending in the interbank market.
</P>
<P>
Long queues were seen at tellers counters at each branch from
opening hour at 10 a.m. until banks closed. Each client waited for
at least half an hour.
</P>
<P>
Many customers said they went to their banks several times but
had to return because of the long queues.
</P>
<P>
The number of checks obtained by commercial banks for clearing
Monday topped 700,000, a record high in banking history in the
country, while the average daily number is 300,000.
</P>
<P>
Normally, each commercial bank delivers checks to the clearing
house before 1 p.m. and the clearing house informs each commercial
bank of its balance at 3:30 p.m..
</P>
<P>
But the clearing house did not inform the balance of each bank
until 4:30 Monday. Commercial banks could not quote their
interbank rates, rendering the interbank mechanism temporarily
paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
A Bangkok bank source said that the bank extended only a small
sum of loans to a few small banks because it did not know its own
position and had to reserve funds for itself.
</P>
<P>
A Thai Farmers Bank source said that commercial banks had to
turn down requests for interbank loans from other banks because
they had to reserve funds for themselves as demand was likely to
be high after the four-day holiday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the capacity of the Bank of Thailand's clearing
house was not efficient enough to cope with demand.
</P>
<P>
The government is expected to put into operation a new clearing
system with higher efficiency soon to avoid any overload problems
in the future.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Needs Optical Fiber Cable Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's national cable
producers have been urged to speed up the establishment of new
optical fiber cable plants to meet the increasing demand for the
commodity.
</P>
<P>
As the country's telecommunication company, Pt Telkom, starts
using optical fiber cables for its telephone installation, demand
for copper cable decreases significantly while the need for
optical fiber cables dramatically rise, according to a report by
the Indonesian Cable Makers Association.
</P>
<P>
The entire telephone networks throughout Indonesia will be
utilizing optical fiber cables in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
However, there is only one optical fiber cable producer in
Indonesia. Pt Telkom has to import the commodity to meet its
increasing demand.
</P>
<P>
The main obstacles hampering the establishment of an integrated
cable factory is huge investment and sophisticated technology.
</P>
<P>
Nine companies have got licenses to set up optical fiber cable
plants, but only one has realized it (Jembo Cable Company).
</P>
<P>
To cope with such problems, the association has called on cable
producers to cooperate with foreign companies with financial and
technological advancements.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Car Market Expected to Be Gloomy in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's car market is expected
to be gloomy in 1996 with consumers waiting for a new cheap model
to go on sale.
</P>
<P>
This year's car sales in Indonesia will be below last year's
380,000 units, according to a prediction report by the Indonesian
Car Producers' Association.
</P>
<P>
The government last week announced tax exemptions for component
imports and luxury items for wholly-Indonesian cars.
</P>
<P>
The only company eligible under the scheme is Pt Timor Putra
Nasional, which is to launch its Timor Family car by September
which will undercut the price of other cars of the same category
by half.
</P>
<P>
Only 16,000 such cars will be sold this year. However, those
consumers who do not get one this year are expected to put off
purchases until next year when more become available.
</P>
<P>
All other cars sold in Indonesia face steep import and luxury
goods taxes which make up more than 60 percent of the price.
</P>
<P>
The government's order has received mixed reactions with some
praising the aim of developing a national car, but many
criticizing the sudden announcement and its sole benefactor.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Japanese assembly companies dominate some 95 percent
of the Indonesian automotive market. A total of 314,858 cars of
different types have been sold in the January-October 1995 period,
Toyota holding the biggest market share with 98,000 units.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: War on Leprosy in Western Pacific  (by Ding Zhaolin) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Manila-based Western Pacific
Regional Office of the World Health Organization (WHO) is planning
to strengthen the fight against leprosy to keep the disease
prevalence below one case per 10,000 people in the region by the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
WHO's Regional Director for Western Pacific Dr. S.T. Han said
at a press conference here leprosy prevalence in the region now
stands at 0.25 per 10,000 on average, with about 40,000 new cases
every year.
</P>
<P>
He said 17 of the 36 countries and regions in Western Pacific
have yet to reach the target that the organization set in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Most of them are Pacific island states, while in Cambodia,
Laos, the Philippines, Vietnam and even Singapore, cured patients
are still regarded as "lepers" and shunned by people.
</P>
<P>
Although the other 19 countries and regions have reached WHO's
target, there are still pockets within some countries where higher
prevalence calls for urgent treatment.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Han told Xinhua that China, as a country with a population
of 1.2 billion people, has been doing an excellent job in reaching
the elimination target set by WHO.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that in China's southern and western parts of
Yunnan, Guizhou, Xinjiang and Tibet, the prevalence of leprosy is
still much higher than the average level. He called for
consistent efforts to keep the disease under control.
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. Han, the regional strategy for the elimination
of leprosy provides for special action programs to extend
multidrug therapy to areas difficult to reach.
</P>
<P>
The programs include reinforcement of in-service training to
improve management as well as monitoring of leprosy elimination
through better surveillance systems and periodic in-depth
evaluation of leprosy control programs.
</P>
<P>
A regional workshop on the elimination of leprosy is being held
in Manila to develop a cost-effective strategy to diagnose and
treat leprosy cases.

JAKARTA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Barren land increases by 200,000
hectares a year in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Environmental damages cause about 200,000 hectares of infertile
land every year, while the rate of land rehabilitation is 400,000
hectares annually, according to the latest data from the Ministry
of Forestry and the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The total area of unproductive land in Indonesia reached 33.9
million hectares at the beginning of the Sixth Five-year
Development Plan in April 1994.
</P>
<P>
Unproductive land, which mostly consists of soil unfit for
agriculture, conservation or water catchment purposes, has been
blamed for the floods which occur in the country every year.
</P>
<P>
Most of the unproductive land is located upstream of 39 major
rivers.
</P>
<P>
One example of the cause of land degradation is the conversion
of water catchment zones in the areas south of Jakarta -- covering
Bogor, Puncak and Cianjur -- into residential areas and commercial
centers, including golf courses.
</P>
<P>
The conversion of water catchment zones was the main cause of
the floods which hit Jakarta in the last two months.
</P>
<P>
The January and February floods in Jakarta killed more than 30
people, forced thousands of families to flee their homes, caused
traffic jams in various areas of the city and cut off telephone
lines and power supply to many households.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the floods caused almost 90 billion rupiah (39
million US dollars) in material losses.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Political Parties Condemn Violent Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of major
political parties in Nepal today condemned the violent activities
in some rural areas of the country during the past three weeks.
</P>
<P>
At an all-party meeting called by Prime Minister Sher Bahadur
Deuba today, representatives of three ruling parties and
opposition parties agreed to hold such consultation frequently and
mobilize the cooperation of all parties in solving national
problems.
</P>
<P>
It was not announced whether any decision was made at the
meeting to further fight against the rampant criminal activities
in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Some remote hilly districts in Nepal have been witnessing
violent activities including looting, killing and arson since
mid-February.
</P>
<P>
Although the government has made security arrangements by
deploying police force in the affected areas, it seems that the
situation in these poverty-stricken districts remains out of
control.
</P>
<P>
The recent violent activities were reportedly carried out by an
underground ultra-leftist group under the name of "people's war".

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Changes Strike Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's mainstream opposition
parties today announced that their scheduled strike program
Wednesday in Dhaka and adjoining five districts will be changed to
nationwide dawn-to-dusk strike on March 7.
</P>
<P>
No reason was given for the change.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)
announced to shift the date of its scheduled public rally to March
7 from March 6 in view of the opposition's March 6 strike call.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties led by the Awami (People's) League
called the strike in protest against the prime minister's radio
and television address to the nation Sunday night, which offered a
non-party government for future national elections. The opposition
opposed the new proposal because it did not meet the opposition
demand for cancellation of the BNP-held "one-party farcical"
parliamentary elections and resignation of the present BNP
government.

<HEADLINE> Public Follows NPC Session With Interest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese public is showing more
interest in the ongoing Fourth Session of the Eighth National
Poeple's Congress (NPC), the central topic of which is to set
forth development programs for China in the coming 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Chinese premier Li Peng made a report on the country's Ninth
Five-year Plan (1996-2000) for national economic and social
development and the long-term target for the year 2010 at the
session in the Great Hall of the People minutes after 9:00 a.m.
today.
</P>
<P>
At the time, Liu Tongshun, a 60-year-old farmer from north
China's Hebei Province, was having a photo taken on Tiananmen
Square with the Great Hall of the People as background.
</P>
<P>
Liu had just come back from visiting some relatives in Inner
Mongolia. He made a special tour to the square after hearing that
the NPC is in session.
</P>
<P>
"In recent years our life has become better and I'm convinced
we'll be more affluent in years to come," he said.
</P>
<P>
Said Li Erxi, a coal worker from the western suburbs of Beijing,
who was taking a walk on the square, "The country's new five-year
plan is relevant to every person in China. I hope the plan
would bring more benefits to us."
</P>
<P>
Xie Jinlian, a retired engineer, was strolling nearby with his
grandson. He said he was happy to learn that the central
topic of the session is to discuss ways to expand the economy and
improve people's life.
</P>
<P>
"The next century belongs to these kids," Xie said, patting
his grandson on the head.
</P>
<P>
A technician for the petroleum industry for years, Xie said
petroleum is the life blood of the national economy. "Increases in
oil output should depend more on advanced science and technology,"
he said. "The premier is correct to emphasize the importance of
science and technology in his report."
</P>
<P>
Prior to the opening of the NPC session, a questionnaire
for workers in ten Chinese cities showed that most people knew
about the main topic of the session.
</P>
<P>
Opposite the Great Hall of the People, many people were having
photos taken in front of a billboard with figures counting the
number of days before China resumes the exercise of sovereignty
over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Said one of them, Liu Hai, a farmer from Hebei Province, "China
used to be bullied and humiliated by foreign powers. I'm glad that
China has really stood up. Our country will have a
brighter future in the next century."

<HEADLINE> Management Skill, Technology Seen as key to Asian  Business Success: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Management skill and adoption of
new technology are the factors most important to the success of
Asian enterprises, according to a survey released in Bangkok,
according to information obtained here today.
</P>
<P>
Right behind these factors are marketing skill, the ability to
produce quality products and strategic planning.
</P>
<P>
Business leaders in four Asian countries and regions surveyed
agreed on these critical business success factors in the study.
</P>
<P>
The survey, named "Asian Values and Business Success," was
conducted by Wirthlin Worldwide, A US-based strategic research
firm. The findings were drawn from in-depth interviews among 60
senior Asian business leaders in six countries and regions --
South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Interviews were conducted in the native languages of the
respondents to ensure localized relevance of the terms used in the
research.
</P>
<P>
The research study also sought to determine if such a thing as
"Asian Value" existed, and found that there was significant
commonalty of values held by the executives surveyed.
</P>
<P>
Regarding key business factors, respondents were asked to rank
17 factors ranging from employee loyalty to access to qualified
labor to infrastructure and telecommunications. Five of the 17
were rated among the top six by respondents in at least four of
the countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Business leaders identified three major advantages which Asia
possessed over North America - pro-business government, employee
loyalty and low taxes. But these three factors were among a
relative few on which leaders said Asia was consistently better
than North America.
</P>
<P>
The findings were presented in Bangkok before "Asian Business
Leaders: The Bangkok Dialogue," a gathering of 150 senior Asian
business executives organized by Dow Jones Asia Dialogues, part of
the Dow Jones &AMP; Co.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Worker's Collection on Zhou Enlai Goes on Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, March 5 (Xinhua) -- An ordinary worker from Beijing
has displayed his collection of photographs and publications on
China's late premier Zhou Enlai today, to mark the 98th
anniversary of the great Chinese leader's birth.
</P>
<P>
The collection, now on show in Tianjin, includes over 10,000
photos of Zhou Enlai, more than 1,000 books on Zhou Enlai, from
home and abroad, and some 1,000 newspapers carrying reports on
Zhou, enabling visitors to learn about the whole life story of
Zhou.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Tienan, 38, a mechanic in a cotton mill, has been
collecting material on the late premier since 1973. They share the
same family name, but are not related. He said that he has been
cherishing a wish to stage an exhibition of his personal
collection on the late premier for years.
</P>
<P>
The worker, whose name means "iron man," spends about one-fifth
of his, and his wife's monthly income, on buying publications
about the late premier.
</P>
<P>
He said that he holds Zhou Enlai as "a historical giant and a
national hero," and that his love for him is based on thoughtful
thinking, rather than blind adoration.
</P>
<P>
He explained that he is not a relative of the late premier and
never had any personal contact with his namesake. But he once
managed just got a glimpse of Zhou Enlai, sitting inside a car in
Changan Avenue, the major street near Tiananmen Square, -- the
only time in his life that he saw his hero in the flesh.
</P>
<P>
"That happened when Zhou was on his way to receive foreign
guests," he said. "The silk curtain on the car window was drawn
open, so I could see him."

<HEADLINE> Iranian Authorities Force Opposition To Cancel Press Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranian security forces today
forced a liberal opposition group to cancel press conference by
confiscating all tapes and films of foreign and local reporters.
</P>
<P>
The press conference held by Freedom Movement of Iran (FMI)
came to halt today when the security forces told the reporters to
disperse after giving in to a body search.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 armed policemen and 10 plain-clothes men surrounded the
building and searched outgoing reporters and other people.
</P>
<P>
This is FMI's third press conference canceled by the
security forces in the past two months.
</P>
<P>
Two other press conferences did not even begin because the
security forces did not allow people to enter the building
where FMI leaders were to meet the reporters.
</P>
<P>
In a statement faxed to Xinhua here, FMI declared that it
boycotts the March 8 parliamentary elections because the
government has blocked all of its channels of communication with
the voting public.
</P>
<P>
A statement distributed by FMI today also accused the government
of "never taking any step in order to hold free and fair
elections."
</P>
<P>
"The government has blocked our access to the people," the
statement charged. It said that the government has only approved
of the candidates that had "gone through its filters."
</P>
<P>
"In effect, elections have become a sort of appointments by
the government," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
FMI leader, Ebrahim Yazdi, told Xinhua that because of the
notice given to him by the security forces he had no choice but to
cancel the press conference.
</P>
<P>
Yazdi is a former foreign minister of Mihdi Bazargan's interim
government which came to power immediately after the victory of
the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Yazdi assumed the position of FMI Secretary-General after
Bazargan died on January 20, 1995.
</P>
<P>
An Associated Press cameraman told Xinhua that he was
subjected to a body search and his two video cassette films were
confiscated.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian female reporter who spoke on condition of
anonymity said that she told security men that they could not
search her bag because "only women security agents can search
the bags of women in Iran." She said that they allowed her
to leave without searching her bag.
</P>
<P>
The armed policemen also confiscated two rolls of film from two
Japanese reporters.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Facing Uneven Distribution of Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- One of the biggest problems in the
education field of Indonesia is the uneven distribution of
teachers.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Education and Culture Wardiman Djojonegoro told the
Third National Conference on Education Monday in Ujungpandang,
South Sulawesi, that few teachers are willing to serve in remote
areas, even as the problem of unemployment in teacher-concentrated
urban areas gets worse.
</P>
<P>
There are places in Indonesia which have an oversupply of
teachers, while other regions need a lot more.
</P>
<P>
Many female teachers quit when they get married or when they
are posted to a remote area.
</P>
<P>
Teachers in remote areas have left their schools over the past
few years because they could not stand the isolation.
</P>
<P>
The distribution problem is caused by poor management and a
lack of manpower planning on the part of government agencies.
</P>
<P>
The problem is also due to the fact that the government can
only pay a limited number of teachers. There are schools which
need more teachers, but the ministry cannot afford to pay them.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has around 1.5 million teachers. Every year, some
17,000 new teaching graduates fight for positions in public
schools.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that by the year 2020, Indonesia will need 1.1
million elementary school teachers and 1.195 million junior and
senior high school teachers.
</P>
<P>
The government is urged to provide greater incentives for
teachers in remote areas. At present, teachers in isolated areas
such as Irian Jaya and Kalimantan receive salaries and subsidies
twice as much as their colleagues' in urban areas of Java.

</P>
<P>
The four-member team arrived at the West London offices

</P>
<P>
The visit was thought to be in connection with complaints from
manufacturers of footballs, possibly of alleged restrictive

Among offices to be searched were those of chief executive
Graham Kelly, coach Terry Venables, and the commercial department.

<HEADLINE> S.Leonean Party Declares Support For SLPP In Presidential Runoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The leader of the People's
Democratic Party (PDP) Sorbeh Thaimu Bangura has ''thrown
his political support''to Tejan Kabbah of the Sierra Leone
People's Party (SLPP) for the March 17 presidential runoff.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with AFP today, Bangura says, ''I want people
to believe I am not a tribalist but a nationalist, that's why I
have affiliated with a party (SLPP) with a southeastern root.''
</P>
<P>
But analysts interpret the political support as ''more
religious than otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
Both Bangura and Kabbah are Muslims and if Kabbah clinches the
presidency, he would be the first Muslim to run the west African
state.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts have been accusing the PDP of ''introducing
religion''into Sierra Leone politics during its election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The SLPP gained 266,893 (35.8 percent) votes in the
presidential poll while the PDP scored 119,782 (16.1 percent).
</P>
<P>
Political commentators explained that the SLPP would still
have to woo other parties to ensure a comfortable win as the huge
turnout in the February 26 and 27 elections ''cannot be
guaranteed this time around because of insecurity mainly from
possible rebel attacks.''
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, election officals reported that voters particularly
in Magburaka, 197 kilometers north of the capital, had their eyes
plucked out by rebels and those whose fingers had indelible ink
were cut off as a warning to potential voters.
</P>
<P>
According to breakdown figures released today by the Interim
National Electoral Commission (INEC), in the parliamentary
elections, the SLPP polled 119,518 votes in the south, 84,712 in
the east, 9,929 in the north and 55,327 votes in the western area
which includes the capital.
</P>
<P>
For the UNPP, the votes were 3,426 in the south, 16,223 in the
east, 94,453 in the north and 47,516 in the west.
</P>
<P>
The All People's Congress (APC), which the military toppled in
the 1992 coup scored the highest vote of 19,272 in the western
area and 1,761 in the south.
</P>
<P>
The computed figures for the presidential election have not
yet been released.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Estate Boom Seen in Metro Manila  (by Xiong Changyi) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Skyscrapers under construction are
lining Ayala Avenue in Makati city, the financial center of Metro
Manila, in a dynamic illustration of investors' confidence
returning to the capital of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Maro Townsend, country representative of the Richard Ellis
Company, said today that Metro Manila is better poised to capture
the interests of Western companies scouring for relocation sites
in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said his firm has been approached by dozens of investors
from Hong Kong, Malaysia and Thailand who are planning to relocate
or expand their operation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Among Manila's major attractions is the high investment return,
which currently hovers between nine and 10 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
While admitting the country's double-digit inflation rates are
worrying foreign property developers, Townsend said, "It has not
detracted anyone from the market."
</P>
<P>
High demand and limited office development have led property
developers and owners to jack up estate prices in Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, office rentals reached 600 pesos (24 US dollars) per
square meter in Makati and 400 pesos (16 US dollars) in Ortigas,
another business district in Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
In Makati city, the office take-up volume is expected to reach
at least 150,000 square meters yearly in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Rentals, which have been rising by 20-30 percent since 1994,
are expected to increase by 10-15 percent in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the rocketing prices and shortage of office space in
Makati have brought a windfall to the business district in
Ortigas, where sale prices and rentals are substantially lower
than those in Makati.
</P>
<P>
The presence of big corporate names and retail giants in
Ortigas, such as the San Miguel Corp., the Asian Development Bank,
the Philippine Stock Exchange and the SM Megamall, has also helped
to draw locators.
</P>
<P>
The Cuervo Far East Inc., an international property consultant
firm, said in its latest market view that "the real estate market
performance reflects the favorable economic climate in the
Philippines at the moment and the outlook continues to be positive
for the foreseeable future."

<HEADLINE> Zhou Nan Speaks Positively of Visa-Free Entry To Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The British decision to accord
visa-free entry to holders of passports of the future Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) has been well received.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Nan, director of the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch,
told reporters today that the decision is "necessary" and wise.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, British Prime Minister John Major announced in Hong
Kong visa-free entry to his country for Hong Kong passport holders
after June 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The British decision to accord visa-free entry complies with
the common desire of the Hong Kong residents, said Zhou, who is
here attending the on-going annual session of the National
People's Congress, China's top legislature.
</P>
<P>
Zhou noted that some member countries of the European Union have
promised to give visa-free entry to holders of passports of the
future Hong Kong SAR at the Asia-Europe Summit, which closed in
Thailand over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
He added that some other countries have also agreed to give it
serious considerations.
</P>
<P>
Zhou expressed the hope that the British side would cooperate
fully with the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR in the
final days before China resumes the exercise of sovereignty in
Hong Kong in an "earnest" and "all-round" manner, so as to ensure
a smooth transition of Hong Kong and a smooth transfer of its
power.
</P>
<P>
As for the concrete forms of cooperation, China will raise them
to the British side shortly after the Second Plenary Meeting of
the Preparatory Committee of the SAR, Zhou Nan said.

<HEADLINE> Over 1,000 Nigerians Die of Meningitis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 Nigerians have died
of cerebrospinal meningitis which began to plague northern Nigeria
in January, the World Health Organization (WHO) said here today.
</P>
<P>
The organization said that the fatal disease hit hardest the
northern state of Bauchi, where as many as 2,504 people have been
infected and 461 of them died.
</P>
<P>
Since the outbreak of the disease, Nigeria's Ministry of Health
has distributed 7 million doses of vaccines to the affected areas,
but about 10 million more doses were needed to save children under
15, the population group most vulnerable to the disease.
</P>
<P>
WHO experts noted that chloramphenicol, the most suitable drug
for meningitis patients, is in great demand and the Nigerian
government has asked the WHO to help procure 50,000 vials of oily
chloramphenicol, which is more convenient to use by health workers
than the powder form.

KUWAIT CITY, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait today condemned the
fatal bombing in Israel Monday, saying that it was aimed at
destabilizing regional security and jeopardizing the Middle East
peace process.

<P>
Kuwait News Agency, citing a foreign ministry official, said
Kuwait followed up "with regret and pain the terrorist actions"
that have recently taken place in Israel and resulted in a number
 of innocent victims.
</P>
<P>
"The state of Kuwait, while condemning such terrorist
operations aimed at destabilizing security and stability in the
region and torpedoing the Middle East peace process, hopes that
efforts aimed at boosting the Middle East peace process for a just
 and comprehensive peace should continue on all tracks," the
agency said.

on one hand and the PLO and Jordan on the other,
has received several blows particularly from Hamas and other

<HEADLINE> Asia's Largest Drinking Water Project Nears Completion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Over 300,000 rural people in
northwest China are preparing to toast the arrival of fresh
drinking water this year.
</P>
<P>
Work on a huge water diversion project is scheduled for
completion in October.
</P>
<P>
The farmers in the four arid counties in Ninxia Hui Autonomous
Region, Gansu and Shaanxi provinces have been drinking harmful
fluorine-rich water for generations.
</P>
<P>
About 300 million has been spent on the project, which started
in 1987 with funding from the central government and the three
provinces and autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
The project, described as the largest of its kind in Asia, was
designed to divert water from the Yellow River section in Ninxia,
to 360,000 thirsty people and 1.27 million livestock. The scheme
will also increase the area of irrigated farmland, prevent local
diseases and improve the local ecological system.
</P>
<P>
With the diverted Yellow River water, the four poor counties
plan to open up wastelands and increase irrigated farmland by
21,333 hectares.
</P>
<P>
About 84 percent of the project has already been completed,
including the building of 10 pumping stations, 10 main channels
totaling 87 km, and 150 km of power transmission facilities.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that the project is completed on schedule - and also
solve a water shortage - the Water Conservancy Minister Niu
Maosheng, and leading officials from the two provinces and
autonomous region, have agreed to inject an extra 40.96 million
yuan into the remaining phase of the project.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Offers Britain Evidence Against MQM Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government has
provided the British government with substantial evidence against
Altaf Hussain, chief of the Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM) (Altaf
Group), about his support to terrorism in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Pakistani Interior Minister Nasirullah Babar
at a press conference held in the southern port city of Karachi
today.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports, the minister said, if needed, the
government can provide more evidence to the British government
about Altaf Hussain's unwanted activities including recorded
cassettes of his voice.
</P>
<P>
The self-exiled Altaf Hussain has stayed in London since
January 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government blamed him for supporting terrorist
activities in Karachi and the continued violence in the city which
claimed more than 1,800 people in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The government is reportedly seeking Altaf Hussain's
extradition from London.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that with recession in terrorist activities
in Karachi, it was now a psychologically opportune time for Altaf
Group to resume talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
He said that he still believes that the situation in Karachi
can only be resolved through political talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Law Minister N. D. Khan hinted today the deadlocked
talks between the government and the MQM will be resumed at the
end of this month.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- A woman farmer who has devoted
over 20 years to painting is to stage exhibitions of her work in
Germany, Italy, France and Austria next month.
</P>
<P>
Kang Jinmei, 38, from the Nanhui County in Shanghai, will have

bamboo cottages, moonlight at a lotus pond, spring sowing and
autumn harvesting.
</P>
<P>
Kang started to paint at the age of 14 after her junior high
school education. She learned her painting skills from books and
observing actual life, she says.
</P>
<P>
"Over these years, I've spent more time on books than on
painting," she said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1983 Kang has staged eight personal art shows in

the mandate they have from the people and their weakest point lies
in the terrorism."
</P>
<P>
He said both the government and the MQM have the responsibility
to restore peace in Karachi.
</P>
<P>
"They (Altaf group) have the mandate of the people and they
should join hands with the government in bringing peace to the
city."
</P>
<P>
When asked about the agenda of the talks, he said, "We will
first take a stock of the situation and then decide from where to
start."
</P>
<P>
With the improvement of the law and order situation, the Sindh
government has removed the ban on pillion riding to the joy and
satisfaction of the people of Karachi, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ban on the use of pagers and mobile phones will also be
lifted in the near future, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government blamed the MQM for the violence in
Karachi that killed over 1,800 people while the MQM accused the
government of suppressing MQM activists.
</P>
<P>
Talks between the two sides that started last July came to a
deadlock as they blamed each other for the deterioration of the
law and order situation in Karachi.
</P>
<P>
The situation has improved this year with more security
measures taken by the government.

<HEADLINE> China to Select Young Explorers for Antarctic Expedition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese children as young as ten
are to be given the chance to take part in the world's first
juvenile expedition to the Antarctic.
</P>
<P>
The children -- aged ten to 16 -- will set off for the ice
covered continent at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
They will conduct scientific experiments at the Antarctic's
Great Wall Station.
</P>
<P>
Now a worldwide search has started to select members of the
expedition. Children living in China will qualify for places, but
so will young Chinese people living overseas.
</P>
<P>
The research project is being jointly sponsored by the Chinese
Antarctic Administration (CAA) and the National Working Committee
of the Chinese Young Pioneers (NWCCYP).
</P>
<P>
Sun Shoushan, deputy director of the NWCCYP, said that the team
members will be selected from Chinese children aged 10 to 16 from
across the country, including Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao, along
with Chinese children living in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
All the applicants must complete forms, giving details about
themselves, and also detail their research projects. The CAA and
the NWCCYP will then organize a group of experts to select team
members from among the applicants, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
Would-be explorers will then have to take physical and
intellectual tests. Successful applicants will then receive
special training and become team members, he said.
</P>
<P>
To help applicants, a book on Antarctic has been compiled and
published jointly by the CAA and the NWCCYP, he added. It gives
directions and details about the Antarctic.
</P>
<P>
The research expedition will be the first of its kind to be
organized in the world for teenagers. In 1986 two Chinese
juveniles went to the Antarctic with help from the CAA and the
NWCCYP. At the Great Wall Station they erected a memorial pole on
behalf of all Chinese children.
</P>
<P>
Jia Genzheng, deputy director of the CAA, said that the
Antarctic, the largest natural laboratory in the world, contains
countless amounts of information, which will help the young people
learn more about the Earth and its environment.
</P>
<P>
Offering an opportunity to juveniles to learn about this
mysterious continent is expected to attract more attention from
more youngsters about China's Antarctic research, Jia said.
</P>
<P>
He added that will also show that there are successors growing
up to carry on the cause of research.
</P>
<P>
China started its Antarctic research in the 1980s, and has so
far sent 12 research teams to the continent. The 12th team, which
left China last November for the Great Wall Station, took all the
equipment and many of daily necessities in readiness for the
juvenile team.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Tamil Rebels Appeal for Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 5 (Xinhua)-- One of the front organizations of
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) has appealed to Sri
Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga for a ceasefire and the
resumption of peace talks, Lankapuvath, the national news agency,
reported this evening.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE political headquarters had read out over its radio
over the weekend the contents of a letter addressed to the
president appealing to her to declare a ceasefire and to resume
negotiations with the LTTE which they claim is the main
representative of the Tamil people, with a view to finding a
solution to the ethnic problem, the report quoted official sources
as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the LTTE has not said it is willing to meet the
government's basic pre-conditions to resume negotiations which are
the laying down of arms, a definite time frame for the
negotiations and the ending of the north-east conflict, the report
added.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE reneged on a cessation of hostilities agreement with
the Sri Lankan government on April 19 last year and embarked on a
series of vicious attacks on the military, forcing the government
troops to retaliate strongly and re-take the LTTE's stronghold of
Jaffna city where it was running an illegal administration.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been waging a 13-year war against the government
in the north and east of the island country in a bid for a
separate Tamil state.

MAPUTO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The waterway of Mozambique's major
port Beira has been seriously silted up, which has affected its
shipping traffic.
</P>
<P>
President of Beira Port Authority Rassul MaHomed said recently
that the depth of the main waterway has reduced from 9.7 to 5
meters, while its width dropped from 135-250 to 75 meters, which
can only accommodate ships under 30,000 tons. But in the past,
ships of 50,000 tons could sail in it freely.
</P>
<P>
The problem is caused for lack of dredgers, he said, adding
that the port authority is concerned that the sailing security is

<HEADLINE> Britain Unhappy with Italy's U.N. Reform Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain has been upset by an
Italian proposal that the United Kingdom and France should
envisage surrendering their permanent seats in the United Nations
Security Council in favor of a single seat for the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper today quoted a Foreign Office official
as saying that the proposal is "a very unfriendly act indeed."
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is within their rights to express their own views,
but Italy must recognize the fact that it is treading on very
sensitive ground where at least three of its European partners are
concerned," the official said.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to a widely-backed plan which suggested that
Germany and Japan be granted new permanent seats in the Security
Council in addition to the five already existing.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Gomersall, Britain's Deputy Ambassador to the U.N., was
also quoted as saying that his country did not envisage any change
in the status of the existing members of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Those members were committed to finding a common European view
where possible, but not at the expense of essential national
interests, he said.
</P>
<P>
Italy's proposal for the eventual elimination of the British
and French seats was floated last week by its ambassador to the
U.N. as part of a continuing debate within the organization about
the expansion of the Council to include new members, according to
the Guardian.
</P>
<P>
During a lunch with journalists in New York last week, the
Italian ambassador said, "My target is only one seat inside the
Security Council with the whole EU taking through it. If we are
going to be serious about creating a federal state we should speak
with one voice in the Council."

<HEADLINE> Britain to Retain Ban on Gays in Armed Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain is to retain its ban on
gays in the armed forces on the grounds that lifting the ban would
harm fighting capability, according to a senior government
minister.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the Defense Ministry's policy on homosexuality
Monday, Armed Forces Minister Nicholas Soames said the British
government would fight to maintain the ban.
</P>
<P>
"Homosexuality in the military would seriously lower morale and
relaxing the ban would also affect cohesion and effectiveness of
our armed forces," he said.
</P>
<P>
Michael Portillo, secretary of state for defense, was reported
last Sunday as saying servicemen were supposed to trust one
another and lifting the ban would create a complication and
jeopardize fighting power, trust and morale in the military.
</P>
<P>
The Homosexuality Policy Assessment Team of the Defense
Ministry conducted a six-month-long survey in the army. The
results released on Monday said 77 percent of those questioned
agreed to maintain the ban, while the rest believed that the
services would be a more comfortable environment if the gays were
accepted.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a group of former gay servicemen challenged
the controversial ban and a judge recommended the Defense Ministry
to review its homosexuality policy.
</P>
<P>
In response, the ministry set up the team to conduct the
wide-ranging survey across the three services to ask thousands of
men and women if they objected to serving alongside gay
colleagues.

<P>
GENEVA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic Committee
said in Lausanne on Tuesday they aimed to trial test athletes at
Atlanta Games for Erythropoietin, or EPO, doping.
</P>
<P>
Prince Alexandre de Merode, president of the IOC's medical
commission, said IOC had finally found a way of detecting EPO,
which stimulates production of red blood cells which carry oxygen
and so give the body more energy.
</P>
<P>
De Merode said that the research into detecting Erythropoietin
has gone well.
</P>
<P>
Athletes turned to EPO when the risk of AIDS and hepatitis
scared them away from blood doping where blood was drawn from the
body and reinjected just before competition.
</P>
<P>
The trials for EPO testing were carried out by Italian
professor Francesco Conconi.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: New Australian Gov't Faces Challenges  (by Lin Zhenxi, Liu Dongkai) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The newly elected coalition
government of Australia is set to face major tests as soon as it
assumes office Friday, with the biggest challenge coming from the
country's influential trade union movement.
</P>
<P>
Bill Kelty, national secretary of the Australian Council of
Trade Unions, has already prepared the battleground for a new wave
of wage-linked strikes.
</P>
<P>
His resignation Monday from the board of the Reserve Bank of
Australia echoed earlier trade unions' demand for a 20-30 percent
wage increase in case of a coalition victory in the March 2
election.
</P>
<P>
Gone with the Labor government is the Wages and Inflation
Accord between the government and trade unions.
</P>
<P>
The accord kept the country's wage growth in conformity with
the reserve bank's target of limiting the inflation rate to 2-3
percent annually.
</P>
<P>
Kelty said that under the coalition's policy of letting the
labor market be ruled by its own forces, trade unions would not
take into consideration the government's inflation target when
making wage demands.
</P>
<P>
Higher wage growth rates will force the reserve bank to tighten
monetary policies, thus putting a brake on the economy that just
began to enjoy some sunshine.
</P>
<P>
Another immediate challenge will be the legacy of the
predecessor government. Australia's budget deficit is expected to
run to as much as nine billion Australian dollars (6.84 billion US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
If the figure proves to be true when the new government
announces the current budget position on its first day of office,
enormous doubts will be cast over its ability to honor its
election promises, which will cost seven billion Australian
dollars (5.32 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The coalition government will find it hard to bring the budget
back to surplus without breaking any of its promises.
</P>
<P>
Though the coalition commands a 44-seat majority in the House
of Representatives, it is unlikely to gain control in the Senate
as it is expected to bag only 37 seats in the 76-seat Senate.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party, which is expected to hold the balance
with 7-8 seats in the Senate, has already threatened to ground the
coalition's act to privatize part of the government-owned
telecommunication company Telstra.
</P>
<P>
In the foreign affairs arena, the coalition is a new face for
most part of the Asian region. After 13 years in opposition, it
has the urgent job to have its foreign policies carried through to
its Asian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Coalition officials are keeping their mouth tight on questions
about future policies before the Liberal Party meets Wednesday
morning, leaving the local press guessing wildly.
</P>
<P>
However, what is certain is that the coalition government is to
inherit one of the most favorable domestic and international
conditions in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
Inflation is set to go down as the global economy is gradually
picking up speed. Higher international demands are expected to
significantly boost Australia's exports, while domestic business
is likely to boom in the latter half of the year.

<HEADLINE> Novel Approach to Families for Xijiang Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- More and more, farmers in Shawan
county of west China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have
learned to live with a new concept: having fewer children means
making more money.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 911 families in the county, 815 of which are farmers
and herdsmen, decided not to have another child, said Wang Weijun,
director of the county's Family Planning Committee.
</P>
<P>
He noted that he finds his work a lot easier now, and recalls
that family planning workers often encountered a great number of
difficulties in their work in rural areas previously.
</P>
<P>
Dou Guangxing, 32, is the owner of a sturdy and attractive
brick house in the county's Xiasangong Village. His seven-year-old
son is his only child, and he and his wife have decided not to
have a second child.
</P>
<P>
Dou explains that he was living apart from his parents after
his marriage and their life was such that they had difficulty
making enough for food and clothing, not to mention providing for
a child as well.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, however, Dou and his wife have made a small
fortune through their hard work and spent 40,000 yuan building
their brick house which also houses a flour mill. Still, they have
decided not to have another child.
</P>
<P>
"It's we ourselves, not our parents, who decide how many
children we will have. The greater the number of children the
greater the responsibility," explains his wife, Shi Yueyan,
"Besides, I'm saving for our son's college expenses."
</P>
<P>
"When villagers here have no laws to guide them, they want to
have more children because a larger family means more power. But
things are different now since laws have been passed," said Dou.
</P>
<P>
In this particular village, favorable policies have been made
to help those families who follow the family planning policy make
more money. One means is to reduce the tuition for their children,
or to exempt them entirely.
</P>
<P>
In China, the elderly still cling to the idea, "the more
children one has, the greater the happiness", but the younger
generation are increasingly thinking along similar lines as Dou
and his wife. And, as the gap between urban and rural areas
narrows in some of the more developed rural areas, many young
farmers and herdsmen who have gained a better understanding of a
nuclear family, tend to have only one child.

LAGOS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Ambassador to Nigeria has
hailed the boldness that Nigeria exhibits when defending her
national rights at international fora.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Taha Shuger Mahmud urged other African
countries which oppose foreign intervention in their domestic
affairs to emulate Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Mahmud made the statement in Nigerian capital Abuja yesterday
when he paid a courtesy call on the Nigerian Minister of State
for Foreign Affairs, Alhaji Idris Alhassan Kpaki.
</P>
<P>
He told Kpaki: "We in Iraq admire Nigeria's role in world
affairs. We also respect your position in global oil politics and
believe that your attitude can hinder any kind of foreign
intervention, especially by the west."
</P>
<P>
Responding to the Iraqi envoy, Kpaki said, "Nigeria does not
need anyone to teleguide her or tell her what to do."
</P>
<P>
He said there was an urgent need for developing countries to
establish their distinct identities provided they did not violate
conventional norms of international politics.
</P>
<P>
"If they (western countries) are protecting their interests,
then we ought to protect our own interests too," the minister
argued.
</P>
<P>
Protesting against last November 10 hanging of Nine Ogoni
activists for murder in south Nigeria, a few western countries
have imposed sanctions against Nigeria.

<P>
SHANGHAI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- China's biggest commercial center
has drawn up plans to boost agriculture this year by 15 per cent.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has announced the setting up of a mechanism to widen
the ways agriculture is financed.
</P>
<P>
Under the mechanism, municipal, district and township
governments will use budgetary and off-budget funds, as well as
raising funds through other channels, for key agricultural
projects.
</P>
<P>
During 1990-1995, governments at each level gathered 6.2
billion yuan to build efficient grain and vegetable production
bases, and to construct and improve water gates, pump houses, and
dams, and on the dredging of key waterways.
</P>
<P>
The city has established two foundations to promote the
application of technology in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The local governments have encouraged collective enterprises
and individuals to invest in agriculture. Efforts have also been
made to attract investments from financial institutions and
government departments, as well as foreign funding.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has plans to increase input in agriculture by 15
percent this year, to ensure the construction of irrigation
projects, highly-productive farmland, and the application of
technology to produce more grains and vegetables.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 5 (Xinhua)-- South African President
Nelson Mandela this morning began three days medical tests in
Johannesburg Park Lane Clinic.
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult to convince the media this man is healthy.
He is not sick, That's the important thing," said Mandela's
spokesman Parks Mankahlana after the president avoided
journalists who had waited several hours for his arrival.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after slipping in the private clinic, a
cheerful Mandela said: "I am my best doctor and the feeling of
well-being in me is strong."
</P>
<P>
"I've had check-ups regularly, This is the most intensive,"
said the president, adding: "I'm long past my teens and i am not
a young man."
</P>
<P>
An office and conference room had been set up inside the
clinic, and Mandela would continue to work and receive visitors
during his three-day stay.
</P>
<P>
The president, who returned home early on Tuesday after a
three-day visit to Mali and Togo in West Africa, agreed to
undergo the most intensive medical check-up to date as a bid by
the government and the African National Congress to refute
damaging rumours that his health was deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
Recent rumours about Mandela's ill-health circulating around
the Johannesburg Stock Exchange had sent the local currency Rand
to record lows on financial markets.

<HEADLINE> "Telecom Market Needs More Amalgamations" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to expand
enterprise mergers in the telecommunications sector in spite of
difficulties in the way.
</P>
<P>
At present, the development of China's telecommunications
market is retarded by the mutually damaging competition of home
enterprises, as well as their low efficiency, according to the
"People's Posts and Telecommunications Daily".
</P>
<P>
Under the increasing pressure from foreign companies, which
sell telecommunications equipment more than 40 billion yuan to
China every year, a nationwide drive for amalgamation, which was
initiated by the government, has quickened the development of
telecommunications plants.
</P>
<P>
But the mergers have not gone smoothly. General Manager Wu
Xingjiang of the Great Dragon Telecommunications Corporation,
China's first mergered group specializing in HJD-04 exchange
manufacturing, complained that his group can hardly reach
agreement on capital and market management, because all the group
members have corporate status and can make capital arrangements by
themselves.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the China Posts and Telecommunications Industry
Corporation (PTIC) has found itself in the similar dilemma in
which the headquarters orders can not be fully implemented by the
factories it has acquired.
</P>
<P>
Liu Dingchuan, a senior engineer at the Ministry of the
Electronics Industry, pointed out that enterprise mergers should
be guided by the "invisible hand" of the market, rather than the
will of administrative bodies.
</P>
<P>
However, as other experts hold, enough heed should be given to
the government's macro-control functions relative to amalgamation.
</P>
<P>
To develop economies of scale as early as possible, the
government plans to concentrate input into several big
telecommunications companies in the coming years, as well as
encourage enterprise mergers through "economic measures" instead
of administrative orders.
</P>
<P>
Both President Jiang Zemin and Wu Jichuan, minister of posts
and telecommunications, have highlighted the amalgamation process
in recent addresses.

<HEADLINE> Phone Exchange Market Sees Fiercer Rivalry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Competition in the telephone
exchange market will become more rigorous, with the production
capacity of China's switching machine makers outstripping the
demand.
</P>
<P>
China had developed a telephone exchange capacity of 64 million
lines by the end of 1994, and the increase margin last year was
between 20 million and 22 million lines, according to the "China
Telecomworld" published here.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications said that the
capacity will hit 170 million lines by the year 2000, which means
a year-on-year increase of 20 million lines should be kept in next
five years.
</P>
<P>
To ensure technical progress that matches the numeral
accumulation of switching equipment, China plans to import
exchanges with 20 million lines of switching capacity, including
250 lines from the Canadian Nortel Company and 2.6 million lines
from Ericsson of Sweden, in next two years.
</P>
<P>
The gap between the import volume and target capacity will be
made up by joint ventures and domestic enterprises, of which the
combined manufacturing capacity is almost double the present
market demand.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the market competition could be more intense than
before.
</P>
<P>
In view of their earlier entry into the market and better
capital support, Sino-foreign joint ventures could have the
advantage over their native competitors.
</P>
<P>
Because a number of telephone switching projects have been
completed in the eastern and central areas, the demand will mainly
arise from the money-strained western China in the coming years.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Marriage Act Up For Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Provisions in the 1971
Marriage Act in Tanzania, which encourage early marriages and
contain loopholes on caring for children born outside marriage,
shall soon be amended.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Mrs. Mary Nagu, the Minister for
Community Development, Women and Children Affairs here on Monday.
She told reporters that laws on child labor would be also amended
to further the protection of the rights of children and women.
</P>
<P>
Outlining government intentions as it marked this year's
celebration of International Day for Women, the minister said
that the government had decided to review marriage and child laws
to curb abuse on the rights of women and children.
</P>
<P>
"Clause no. 5 of the 1971 act will soon be amended because the
government has realized that it has loopholes which allow
haphazard and early marriages," she said.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Nagu said that under the proposed amendments no one would
be allowed to marry a girl under the age of 18.
</P>
<P>
The current marriage laws had no binding clauses which clearly
stipulated requirements on the custody of children and the
distribution of family properties in case of divorce or death of
the bread winner for married couples, she noted.
</P>
<P>
The new amendments would draw up regulations binding parents
to take care of their children born outside marriages, the
minister said. She said, "Many children who were born outside
marriage have been suffering due to inadequate family care owing
to weaknesses in the current marriage laws."
</P>
<P>
She added that as a result of loose legal provisions on
protecting children's rights, the number of street children was
rising in the urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions, the minister said that the government
was very keen on the protection of the rights of women by
implementing the Beijing resolutions calling for more efforts to
raise the decision making capacity of women in society.
</P>
<P>
She explained that the efforts must include concerted action
to improve the welfare of families, expand political
participation of women and boost their economic power.
</P>
<P>
"Laws relating to the provision of credits and loans will be
reviewed to allow more women to borrow money from the commercial
banks," the minister said adding that the government was also
going to issue a directive to local councils to allocate 10 to 20
percent of funds meant for development expenditure to women's
development.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Manila Confident to Lower Inflation  (by Xiong Changyi) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- With the successful implementation
of supply-related measures, the Philippine government appears
confident to bring down the country's rising inflation in the
immediate future.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released today by the Central Bank of the
Philippines, the inflation rate continued its climb and reached
11.8 percent in February from January's 11.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
But Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson affirmed that
inflation would "taper off" in the second quarter and drop to six
percent, or even lower, at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
"This inflation rate is in the lower end of the 11.8 percent to
12.5 percent range expected by the business community for the
month of February," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the figure was understandable considering the
impact of the expanded value-added tax and the hike of fuel prices
and wages in February.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the government's optimism is based on the
effective implementation of supply-related measures, including a
programmed increase in rice imports and an expected bumper harvest
of rice this year.
</P>
<P>
A shortage of rice supply in the Philippines in 1995 drove the
inflation rate to 8.1 percent, higher than the government's target
of 6.5-7 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the demand side, the government has maintained prudence in
its monetary policy to avoid fueling further inflationary
pressure.
</P>
<P>
According to the Central Bank, the average reserve money level
for the February test period stood at 190.2 billion pesos (7.6
billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
This was substantially below the indicative ceiling of 206.3
billion pesos (8.244 billion US dollars) under the country's 1996
monetary program supported by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF).
</P>
<P>
The government's optimism about a decelerating inflation rate
was echoed by a visiting IMF mission, which arrived here last
week.
</P>
<P>
Khadim Al-Eyd, head of the IMF mission, agreed with Manila's
projection that inflation would remain high in the early part of
the year but would eventually be brought down to six percent by
the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> More Shanghai Residents Get Own Houses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Yao Xizhen, a 40-year-old lady
now living in her own flat in this metropolis which was once
notorious for its shortage of housing, returns home with peace of
mind, no longer worrying about the disputes that used to arise
from sharing a kitchen and toilet with her neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Yao is one of the numerous Shanghai residents who have moved
out of the outdated simply-built houses into independent and
well-equipped residences with their own kitchens and toilets.
</P>
<P>
For a long time many Shanghai residents had to live in crowded
and aged residential areas, with more than two households sharing
one kitchen and toilet, causing much inconvenience and disharmony
between neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has made great efforts in the past few
years to improve residents' housing conditions and has given
priority to building flats with complete housing facilities.
</P>
<P>
To date, some 50 percent of the residences in this city are
equipped with kitchens and toilets, which has remarkably enhanced
the residents' living conditions, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
Shi Xinguang, a worker at the Shanghai Glass Machinery Plant,
said he felt deeply about the change.
</P>
<P>
He once shared an apartment with others. However, the public
kitchen and toilet were always in a fearful mess, because no one
cared about the cleaning and decoration of the public space and
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Now he feels very comfortable living in his new residence with
independent kitchen and toilet, which are always clean and tidy,
and equipped with a smoke extractor and gas-fueled water heater.
</P>
<P>
Many young couples in this metropolis rejoice over moving into
independent residences, for they finally have their own "private
space".
</P>
<P>
A young couple told the reporter that when they lived in the
old dwelling place they had only one thin plank separating their
living quarters from those of their neighbors. They felt very ill
at ease, for they had to speak in low voices and walk softly all
day long for fear of disturbing their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The local officials said that disputes between neighbors have
been greatly reduced since more and more residents have moved into
independent flats.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has set the goal of making the rate of
independent flats reach 75 percent of the total, alongside the
target of enhancing the average per capita living space of the
city from the current 7.5 sq m to 10 sq m by the year 2000.

</P>
<P>
The figure, released earlier by the country's development
ministry, registered an increase of 93,000 foreign expatriates in
just one year, he said.
</P>
<P>
99 percent of the foreign workers were from Asian countries, he
added.
</P>
<P>
In a recent closed-door meeting of the Oman Chamber of Commerce
and Industry (OCCI), Sultan said that such a huge influx of
expatriate workers to the country had proved to be the biggest
hurdle in the government's Omanization plan.
</P>
<P>
Similar warnings about the danger posed by the growth of
expatriate labor force were made last month by an Omani expert on
human resource development, Fuaad Jaffer Sajwani.
</P>
<P>
"The growth rate of the expatriate labor force is far beyond
the growth rate of the GNP of the country," Sajwani said.
</P>
<P>
The Omani minister said he would urge industrialists to ensure
that at least 35 percent of their workforce comprise Omanis from
the very beginning of a new project.
</P>
<P>
And the industrialists would be asked to take up a different
venture, if the project fails to meet the employment ratio, the
minister added.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, a total of 174,000 Omanis, including
82,000 university graduates, would be knocking at the doors of
employment, the minister said.

<P>
NANJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Help from the government, schools
and society will relieve the worries of the 20,000 poor college
students in east China's Jiangsu Province that they might have to
drop out of school for economic reasons.
</P>
<P>
College students from poor families have been provided with a
series of assistance, ranging from scholarships, student loans,
and lower or free tuition fees to monetary assistance, offering
opportunities for them to become self-supporting.
</P>
<P>
A group of universities have provided part-time jobs for poor
students and set up special funds to offer financial help for
them.
</P>
<P>
Students at Nanjing Teachers' University can receive a total of
600,000 yuan (76,000 US dollars) in scholarships every year.
</P>
<P>
In Wuxi City local people donated one million yuan for the poor
students last November.
</P>
<P>
Now, some 210,800 students are receiving higher education in
Jiangsu's 67 colleges and universities. Of them, 20,000 only have

<HEADLINE> Seoul, London to Help Promote Asia-Europe Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 5 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and Britain have agreed
to jointly "lead the partnership between Asia and Europe," South
Korean President Kim Young-sam told reporters here today after a
summit meeting with British Prime Minister John Major in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
They also decided to work together to make both the second
Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) in London in 1998 and the third ASEM in
Seoul in 2000 successful.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, the two leaders agreed to set up a joint
committee between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two leaders discussed ways of enhancing
bilateral cooperation and follow-ups to proposals made at the
first ASEM, which ended last Saturday in Bangkok, Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Kim and Major both attended the inter-continental meeting along
with 23 other Asian and European leaders plus the president of the
European Union (EU) commission, Jacques Santer.
</P>
<P>
Kim thanked Major for EU's recent decision to offer financial
support to the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization
(KEDO), while Major expressed willingness to continue to urge
other EU countries to participate in KEDO activities politically
and financially.
</P>
<P>
The KEDO, a multinational consortium led by the United States,
South Korea and Japan, is responsible for supplying the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) with two light-water nuclear
reactors under a Washington-Pyongyang framework agreement signed
in Geneva in October 1994.
</P>
<P>
Major pledged support for South Korea's bid to become a member
of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and
promised to cooperate with it after it is admitted to the
Paris-based club of industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also agreed to work together for the speedy
adoption of the recently-initialed South Korea-EU cooperation
framework agreement and joint political declaration.
</P>
<P>
Major arrived here from Hong Kong last night for a two-day
official visit to South Korea, the first by a British prime
minister since Margaret Thatcher made a trip to Seoul in 1986.

BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- China here today urges the US
administration to take prompt and effective steps to block
anti-China clauses in a bill from becoming law.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Shen Guofang made the
statement at a press conference when asked to comment on a unified
version of the State Department Authorization, Reform and Foreign
Assistance Bill adopted by the Joint Conference of the US Senate

</P>
<P>
"That bill contains many anti-China clauses which defy the
norms governing international relations, violate the principles of
the three Sino-US Joint Communiques, seriously undermine China's
sovereignty and grossly interfere in China's internal affairs",
Shen noted.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese side is firmly opposed to it and has made solemn
representations with the US side", Shen told the press conference.
</P>
<P>
"We urge the US administration to state its clear opposition
to it and take prompt and effective steps to block these
anti-China clauses from becoming law, so as to forestall possible
serious damage to Sino-US relations", the spokesman said.

</P>
<P>

CANBERRA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar became
weaker today, ending over a quarter US cents lower at 75.88 US
cents from 76.28 US cents yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The continuing fall of the local currency was out of the
expectations of local investors. The Australian dollar went lower
under the pressure of weaker gold prices and fears of a blowout of
budget deficit.

The budget for 1996-97 is expected to be in a deficit of nine

<HEADLINE> Re-use of Wastewater Recommended by Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Re-use of wastewater has been
recommended by experts as a national policy to derive maximum
benefit from available water resources.
</P>
<P>
It was recommended by experts from Arab and Gulf countries,
Europe and the sub-continent at the first Inter-country Workshop
on Re-use of Wastewater which ended in Abu Dhabi Monday,
</P>
<P>
Experts said re-use of treated wastewater for irrigations could
be an integral part of resource use in each country, thereby
conserving a significant volume of fresh water currently used in
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
They called upon the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to allocate
special funds for research in wastewater treatment and re-use.
</P>
<P>
The workshop underlined the need to reassure farmers that
crops irrigated with treated wastewater were safe and
indiscriminate use of untreated water held a high health risk.)
</P>
<P>
The workshop recommended an evaluation of wastewater treatment
and re-use in Abu Dhabi.
</P>
<P>
The UAE is a country with rich oil resources but it sits on a
wide desert. While using ingenious methods to capture the scarce
rainfall or the underground water supplies, the country uses
mostly desalinated waters and re-use treated wastewater for
irrigation. The experience is widely praised.

PYONGYANG, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic

South Korea for starting a joint military exercise in Texas on
March 2, saying such a drill was not conducive to peace and
reunification on the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The official Rodong Sinmun said in a commentary today that
since the exercise was "modeled on the ground war by the
combatants" in the Gulf War as admitted by the United States and
South Korea, it was actually "part of the preparations for
exporting the Gulf War into the Korean peninsula."
</P>
<P>
The joint training involved the U.S. third corps and more than
300 South Korean commanders above the division level, said the
newspaper.
</P>

DPRK has been following the development with great concern, the
newspaper said, adding it would be better for the United States

<HEADLINE> NPC-Plenary Session 1st add  NPC 4th Session Holds Second Plenary Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The fourth Session of the Eighth
National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature, held
its second plenary meeting here this afternoon to examine annual
economic and social development plans and budgets.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jinhua, minister in charge of the State Planning
Commission, delivered a report on the implementation of the 1995
national economic and social development plan and on the draft
national economic and social development plan for 1996.
</P>
<P>
He proposed the major economic and social development
objectives of macro-control for 1996 on behalf of the State
Council: the GDP growth rate will be set at eight percent; the
rate of investment in fixed assets at some 32 percent, and the the
range in price rise around 10 percent; currency issue 100 billion
yuan (about 12 billion US dollars); foreign trade volume 281
billion US dollars; and the natural population growth rate at 12
per thousand.
</P>
<P>
The national economic and social development plan for 1995 has
been well carried out, and the major macro-control objectives set
for last year have been realized, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said efforts must be made to promote a shift in
economic growth mode, from relying mainly on the building of ever
more production facilities to relying mainly on improved
management and advances in science and technology.
</P>
<P>
The shift is expected to solve the longstanding problems of
high costs and low economic returns in China's current economy,
Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
Liu Zhongli, minister of finance, gave a report on the
implementation of the 1995 central and local budgets and the draft
central and local budgets for 1996, to the NPC deputies.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government has proposed cutting its
budgeted annual deficit by five billion yuan (about 600 million US
dollars) this year and its actual deficit will stand at 61.442
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Liu spoke highly of the implementation of the budget for 1995,
saying that state revenue reached 618.773 billion yuan last year,
up 18.6 percent over the previous year, and expenditure 680.917
billion year, an increase of 17.6 percent over 1995.
</P>
<P>
The expanding deficits and debts over the years have seriously
weakened the macro-economic control capability of the central
government, and will impede a sustained, rapid and sound
development of the national economy, the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
He pledged to continue implementing a tight fiscal policy this
year, calling on local governments and central government
departments to strictly control expenditures and avoid wastes.
</P>
<P>
Liu also announced a governmental plan to issue a record amount
of government treasury bonds of 195.257 billion yuan (23.5 billion
US dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
They are for bond repayment on principal and interest, and to
cover budgeted deficit and foreign loans for major state
construction projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tian Jiyun, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee,
presided over the meeting.

awakening Vietnamese market, which is trying to integrate itself
into the global economy, according to a recent trade report.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong remains the second largest investor in Vietnam after
Taiwan, says the "Trade Watch" report, published by the Hong Kong
Trade Development Council.

Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's total exports to Vietnam saw a growth of 21 percent
in the first 10 months of 1995, to 4.5 billion HK dollars (577

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Drug Victim, Ranariddh Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian First Prime Minister
Norodom Ranariddh said today that his country is a drug victim and
that it is unfair to list Cambodia as a drug trafficker.
</P>
<P>
He believed that drug consumers should be blamed for the
rampant drug dealing.
</P>
<P>
Drug production would be pointless if there were no drug users,
said Ranariddh, noting that the United States is the world's
largest drug importer.
</P>
<P>
He said he and Second Prime Minister Hun Sen have discussed the
matter in a letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton, and the two
prime ministers have appealed for a big international conference
to be held to examine the consequences of drug use on societies.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh noted that both the royal government and King Norodom
Sihanouk have been working hard to prevent Cambodia from becoming
a drug transit country.
</P>
<P>
Cambodian drug control agencies tracked down five drug
trafficking cases and seized more than 70 kilograms of drugs in
the 12 months beginning December 1994.
</P>
<P>
This last January the government approved a draft bill to ban
marijuana planting and drug production, addiction and
trafficking. The bill also called for the creation of a committee
to fight money laundering and to punish law enforcement officials
involved in drug trafficking.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Control Is Top Priority For This Year: Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Containing inflation remains the
top priority for the government's macroeconomic controls this
year, Chinese Premier Li Peng said here today.
</P>
<P>
After delivering his report at the ongoing session of the
National People's Congress, China's top law-making body, Li said
in a brief interview, "Special attention should continue to be
paid to controlling the range of price rises this year. Containing
inflation remains the top priority for macroeconomic controls."
</P>
<P>
On last year's critical issues that have been tackled with
remarkable results, Li said inflation stood out as one of them.
</P>
<P>
"With the government taking a series of measures, inflation was
brought down to an annualized 14.8 percent in 1995," he said.
</P>
<P>
Inflation soared to a dangerous 21.7 percent in 1994, causing
great concern among government officials, scholars and ordinary
people.
</P>
<P>
The premier said the Ninth Five-Year Plan starts in 1996, and a
good beginning is crucial to the fulfilment of China's medium- and
long-term goals for national economy and social development.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on whether China can achieve its medium- and
long-term goals, the premier quoted the late Chairman Mao Zedong,
"It is the people, and the people alone, who are the driving force
in the making of history."
</P>
<P>
"We are bound to achieve the goals as long as we have the
support of people of the whole nation." Li said.

<HEADLINE> Hunan Forest Parks Draw Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Forest parks in central China's
Hunan Province draw about two million Chinese and overseas
tourists a year.
</P>
<P>
To date, 18 state-run forest parks and 16 province- or
county-owned forest parks exceeding 233,300 ha in total area have
been opened to tourists in the province, which generated a
combined direct income of 150 million yuan (about 18.072 million
US dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the forest parks has not only helped boost
tourism, but also afforestation, cultivation, industry and trade,
provincial officials pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The success of the Zhangjiajie Forest Park, which was the first
national park in the country, has triggered the development of a
series of forest attractions such as Tianzishan, Suoxiyu,
Maoyanhe, and Mengdonghe forest parks.
</P>
<P>
In order to better develop tourism while protecting the
environment, Zhangjiajie City has designated a nature reserve and
a human biosphere in the forest park. In addition, the city plants
an estimated 16,600 ha of new trees a year.
</P>
<P>
The forest parks are also sources of a number of valuable
fruits and medical herbs.
</P>
<P>
The province has promulgated regulations regarding the
management of forest parks, which is the first such legislation in
China.

<HEADLINE> Bosnia Denies Its Troops Trained in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian ambassador to Tehran Omer
Behmen refuted claims that Bosnian troops are being trained in
Iran, an official report said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian ambassador said "there are no Bosnian troops in
Iran," adding that there is no proof whatsoever to support the
contention.
</P>
<P>
Behmen made the statement in today's English-language daily,
Tehran Times, with background of Iranian Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
However, reports from the West said that the Bosnian
government has sent troops to Iran for training in a bid to
upgrade its military capability.
</P>
<P>
The daily also reported that an informed source at the Iranian
Foreign Ministry has strongly rejected the report as being
"baseless and unfounded."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official noted that the false propaganda spread by
the U.S. is aimed at weakening Iran's humanitarian aid to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Islamic Republic has no military
cooperation with the Bosnians.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials and media are trying to disseminate the
misinformation that Iran is militarily involved in Bosnia, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Such claims have been debunked by Bosnian Prime Minister Hasan
Muratovic who emphasized during his visit to Iran that Bosnia's
reconstruction was its most urgent need, said the editorial of the
daily.
</P>
<P>
Muratovic had wrapped up his visit to Tehran and left Monday
morning. However, local press gave no any coverage of his
departure.
</P>
<P>
Both sides did not reveal anything on what agreement they
reached or what kind of assistance Iran is going to offer in
reconstructing Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Muratovic said "The Bosnia people expected Islamic countries,
especially Iran, to rebuild their country now that relative calm
has returned," to the former Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said that his
country is ready to take part in Bosnia's reconstruction drive
and urged other Islamic countries to do the same.

<HEADLINE> China's Poor Population Drops to 65 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Some 20 million Chinese had been
lifted out of poverty during China's Eighth Five-Year Plan period
(1991-95) that ended by in December last year, Premier Li Peng
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Fourth Plenary Session of the National People's
Congress, China's legislature, Li said that China's population
below the poverty line was reduced from 85 million at the end
of 1990 to 65 million last year.
</P>
<P>
China's poor population, at 150 million in the late 1970s, was
concentrated mainly in old revolutionary bases, areas inhabited by
ethnic minority groups and remote and boundary areas. Such areas
are chiefly in the southwestern and northwestern parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
By the Chinese standards, the people in poverty means those
who do not have enough to eat and wear, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
However, Li noted, it remains an arduous task particularly in
rural areas during the new Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) to
feed and cloth the poor people, especially those living in the
countryside. He urged governments at all levels to make greater
efforts to help more people overcome their difficulties

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- A survey shows that the number of
newlyweds undergoing pre-marital physical checkups here rose
sharply in 1995 from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted last September, shows that only three
percent of couples had not had such examinations before marriage,
compared with 75.4 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The survey covered 1,758 local urban and rural residents in the
20-29 age bracket, with 91.2 percent of them marrying for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that one percent of couples who marry for the
first time avoid physical checkups, compared with 9.2 percent of
those who marry for second time or more, thinking them to be
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
It also shows that urban couples are more willing to have
physical checkups than their rural counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Such examinations are an effective measure to prevent
hereditary and infectious disease, local doctors explained.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Fertilizer crisis again grips north Bengal  (By Jiang Xianming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Farmer unrest is brewing in northern
districts of Bangladesh due to a serious fertilizer crisis that is
hitting the main rice crop farming again this season.
</P>
<P>
In March last year, farmers in the region launched an agitation
campaign against fertilizer shortage and price hikes, causing
chaos and unrest. An unspecified number of people were killed and
several hundreds others injured in clashes between police and the
farmers who allegedly looted fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the fertilizer crisis once again began to grip the
north Bengal. Thousands of agitated farmers mainly in districts of
Sherpur, Nakhla and Rajshahi have held demonstrations, laid siege
to local authorities' offices, put up barricades on highways to
stop trucks carrying fertilizer, and forced the dealers to sell
the fertilizer among them.
</P>
<P>
According to sources, the demand for fertilizer in the country
is 1.8 million tons while the annual output of the country's six
fertilizer factories is more than 20 million tons.
</P>
<P>
But actually there has been a severe shortage of fertilizer in
the north Bengal. Farmers as well as the farm sector trade unions
are worried that if the situation continues for another two to
three weeks, a shortfall in the season's paddy production could
reach 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The protesters have blamed massive corruption in the privatized
distribution system for the crisis, while dealers shifted part of
the blame on the transport problem due to the staggering political
unrest by the prolonged government-opposition conflict.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by an non-governmental organization revealed
that the government has appointed some 2,000 dealers for the 16
districts in the north Bengal to ensure adequate fertilizer supply
and prevent spiralling prices. But about 70 percent of the
appointments were given under political influence.
</P>
<P>
"The dealers got their jobs by showing false documents and
papers while some of them were patronized by upperhand lobbies," a
veteran peasant leader said, demanding abolition of the dealership
system and stern actions against black-marketers.
</P>
<P>
At least 50 percent of such dealers have no godowns to store
fertilizer and so they allegedly black-market total quotas of
fertilizer after taking delivery from mill gates, it was reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, at present, the urea fertilizer badly
needed by the farmers sells at tk 340-370 (about 8.5-9.25 U.S.
dollars) per 50-kg bag against the government-fixed rate of tk
186.25 (about 4.65 dollars), while ssp fertilizer sells for tk
380-400 (9.5-10 dollars) per bag, up from its fixed price of tk
280-300 (7-7.5 dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, State Minister for Industry Lutfor Rahman Khan said
there was no reason for any flaw to appear in the distribution of
fertilizer in the current sowing season nor any scopes for price
hikes, as all measures were neatly drawn up to ensure supply of
fertilizer at the farm level at a reasonable price.
</P>
<P>
He expressed concern about a dislocation in the transport of
fertilizer by the dealers after receiving it from factories and
buffer stock godowns, because of disruption in the communications
system caused by the opposition-led anti-government programs.

<P>
Israel Radio said that police will carry out intensive check
and searches at all places where large groups of people gather,
and the Israeli public is asked to be alert and patient.
</P>
<P>
Security officials told the public that despite the anger and
frustration after a series of suicide attacks against Israeli
civilians, acts of revenge will serve no purpose.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army has imposed a full closure on the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip, and Palestinian residents inside the West Bank
and Gaza have been barred from leaving towns and villages.
</P>
<P>
There is also a ban on employing Palestinian workers in Israel
and on Jewish settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip,
Israelis and Palestinians caught defying these orders will be
severely punished.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hamas-affiliated organizations operating in eastern
Jerusalem will be closed down by administrative order.
</P>
<P>
Hamas has claimed responsibility for a series of four suicide
attacks against Israeli targets in the last eight days, which left
more than 50 dead and over 150 others wounded.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said that security forces will also seal and
destroy "the homes of the suicide bombers and other terrorists,"
adding that "from this morning eight homes of terrorists have
already been sealed off."

<P>
CANBERRA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Australia on Tuesday appointed
John Iliffe as the new president of the Sydney Organising
Committee for the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Iliffe, 59, will take the place of Gary Pemberton, chairman of
the national airline Qantas Airways Ltd, who quit the post for
business and personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
Iliffe, chairman of Australian retailer Woolworths, insurance
firm GIO Australia and electronics company AWA Ltd, said he would
not abandon his current business roles.
</P>
<P>
The new president was due to fly to Lausanne, Switzerland, on
Tuesday to meet with President of International Olympic Committee
(IOC) Juan Antonio Samaranch and other IOC officials.
</P>
<P>
Pemberton was unsatisfied with IOC's decision to sell the
European television rights to the 2000 Olympics to the European
Broadcasting Union for 350 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said the move cost the Sydney organisers a potential budget
surplus of 130 million Australian dollars (96.2 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
But Pemberton said he had told Samaranch on Monday that the
European television deal had nothing to do with his decision to
quit.

<HEADLINE> China Plans to Start Limited Transfer Payment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- China plans to start transfer
payment from the central government to the local governments on a
limited basis this year to narrow regional disparities in economic
development, Minister of Finance Liu Zhongli said here this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Liu made this statement in a report he delivered to the
deputies to the Fourth Session of the Eighth National People's
Congress, which opened this morning.
</P>
<P>
A transfer payment system consisting of subsidies granted
according to the financial system, special subsidies and tax
refunds has basically been formed in China since the introduction
of the revenue-sharing financial regime two years ago, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
However, this system still needs to be improved and
standardized, Liu told the deputies.
</P>
<P>
"From the experience of other countries with such a system, the
rights and responsibilities of the central and local governments
must be specified," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the methods for calculating payments and the
completeness of statistical data require highly technical
standards.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the objective and subjective conditions are not yet
ripe for China to establish a standard transfer payment system at
present," Liu said, noting that a large deficit and heavy debt
burden has limited the amount of money available for transfer
payments.
</P>
<P>
In order to ease the financial difficulties of the national
minority-inhabited and poverty-stricken areas, the central
government will still do all it can to distribute the limited
funds to the selected areas this year, Liu said.

<HEADLINE> Finance Minister on Cutting Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government plans to
cut its budgeted annual deficit by five billion yuan (about 600
million US dollars) this year, according to Chinese finance
minister Liu Zhongli.
</P>
<P>
Liu revealed the plan in his report on the implementation of the
central and local budgets for 1995 and on the draft central and
local budgets for 1996 delivered at the Fourth Session of the
Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), the country's top
legislature, here today.
</P>
<P>
China's actual deficit last year was 66.442 billion yuan,
slightly less than the budgeted figure of 66.68 billion yuan, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
The deficit budgeted for 1996 is 61.442 billion yuan, five
billion yuan less than the actual figure of last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu: state revenues reached 618.773 billion yuan
in 1995, up 96.963 billion yuan, or 18.6 percent, over the
previous year. Expenditures rose by 17.6 percent, or 101.655
billion yuan. "It's the first time in years that increase in
state revenues exceeded that in outlays," he said.
</P>
<P>
State revenues for 1996 are budgeted at 687.218 billion
yuan, an increase of 11.1 percent over last year. Budgeted
expenditures stand at 748.66 billion yuan, up 9.9 percent over
1995, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Expanding deficits and debts over the past years have seriously
weakened the macro-economic control capability of the central
government and will impede a sustained, rapid and sound
development of the national economy, the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
To tackle the issue, the Ministry of Finance has formulated a
strategy to cut domestic debt and eliminate financial deficit by
the end of this century, he said.
</P>
<P>
Liu pledged to continue implementing a tight fiscal policy this
year, calling on local governments and central government
departments to strictly control expenditures.

<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- China plans to issue a record
amount of government treasury bonds in 1996, Minister of Finance
Liu Zhongli said here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a report on the implementation of the central and
local budgets for 1995 and on the draft central and local budgets
for 1996 to deputies to the Fourth Session of the Eighth National
People's Congress, China's top legislature, Liu said that China
plans to issue 195.257 billion yuan (about 23.5 billion US
dollars) in government treasury bonds this year.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the bulk of the planned amount is for bond
repayment on principal and interest, which stands at 133.169
billion yuan this year, 46.2 billion yuan more than in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The remainder will be used to cover a budgeted deficit of
61.442 billion yuan and foreign loans for major state construction
projects, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
China resumed the practice of floating government treasury
bonds in 1981. The size of annual bond issue had grown to 19
billion yuan in 1991 and over 150 billion yuan last year.

research in basic sciences.
</P>
<P>
Ding Jianhua, deputy general manager of the Tianjin First Light
Industrial Corp.: Tianjin municipal bureaus in charge of various
industries have recently been transformed into corporations
entrusted with the management of state assets in the city. This

state-owned enterprises will fare better in the Ninth Five-Year
Plan period with deepening reforms, management improvements, and
implementation of government policies that aim to revive
traditional industrial bases.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Chunxiang, a deputy and a textile worker from Hunan, who

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 5 (Xinhua) -- A senior government official of
Zimbabwe has called for more dialogue between the government and
the private sector to foster the development of the country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Matabeleland Chamber of Industries annual
general meeting in western Zimbabwe on Monday, the Chief
Secretary to the President and Cabinet, Charles Utete, said
consultation and unity of purpose would assist the second phase
of the economic reforms of the country starting this year to
achieve its goals of uplifting the wellbeing of people.
</P>
<P>
It was also through dialogue, said Utete, that Zimbabwe could
command a place on the global village where national economies
had ''cut-throat'' competition.
</P>
<P>
''There is need for mutual trust and understanding and
reduction of unnecessary suspicions and bureaucracy on both
sides,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The government on its part was introducing several measures to
ensure efficient delivery of services such as a proposed national
development council which would have members from the government,
local authorities and the private sector, he said.

<HEADLINE> Top Planner Urges Shift in Economic Growth Mode </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Efforts must be made to promote a
shift in economic growth mode, from relying mainly on the building
of ever more production facilities to relying mainly on improved
management and advances in science and technology, said Chen
Jinhua, Minister of the State Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remark here today at the ongoing Fourth Session
of the Eighth National People's Congress, China's top legislature,
while delivering a report on national economic and social
development.
</P>
<P>
"Such a shift is the key to accomplishing our trans-century
objectives," he said.
</P>
<P>
The extensive economic growth mode, characterized by high costs
and low returns, is the cause for many contradictions and problems
in China's current economy, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
China has an economy of considerable size, its output of farm
products, energy and major raw materials being among the largest
in the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the quality of economic growth and economic returns in
China are not satisfactory because of a low technical content and
high consumption of energy and raw materials, the minister told
the NPC deputies.
</P>
<P>
"Rapid development won't be sustainable if it relies solely
on a high consumption of resources when the scale of the Chinese
economy keeps growing," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Starting this year, he said, the shift in China's economic
growth mode will be achieved mainly through making full use of
existing facilities, giving a greater role to scientific and
technological advances, practicing economy in the use of
resources, further improving the organizational structure of
enterprises and their investment structure, and giving full play
to market forces.
</P>
<P>
Barriers among different regions, departments and sectors must
be removed so as to develop economies of scale, which the minister
said will first be pursued in sectors of petrochemicals, motor
vehicles, iron and steel, power, machinery and electronics in the
Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
Chen said planning, industrial policies and legislation will be
used simultaneously to promote the shift he is talking about.
</P>
<P>
Major economic objectives for 1996, according to the minister,
are as follows:
</P>
<P>
-- a GDP growth rate of eight percent;
</P>
<P>
-- a 32 percent rate in investment in fixed assets;
</P>
<P>
-- an inflation rate of about 10 percent;
</P>
<P>
-- a currency issue of 100 billion yuan (about 12 billion US
dollars);
</P>
<P>
-- a foreign trade volume of 281 billion US dollars;
</P>
<P>
--a natural population growth rate of 12 per thousand;
</P>
<P>
-- seven million job opportunities for urban dwellers;
</P>
<P>
-- jobs for five million rural laborers in industrial and
service sectors.

<P>
NEW YORK, March 4 (Xinhua) -- More low income New Yorkers will
qualify for loans to buy homes as a five-year investment plan was
released today to raise the level of home ownership in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
Under the broad plan, New York will get 8 billion U.S. dollars
in mortgages from the Federal National Mortgage Association, or
Fannie Mae, the nation's largest provider of mortgage loans.
</P>
<P>
Applicants will be entitled to a down payment as low as 5
percent, even 3 percent in some cases.
</P>
<P>
The five-year plan, which was announced by Mayor Udolph
Giuliani and Fannie Mae senior officials, has been developed by
the lending agency to supplement a nine-year-old housing
rehabilitation program to help low income citizens.
</P>
<P>
Under the nine-year program, New York has spent 4 billion
dollars to build and renovate houses and sell most of them to
people who could not otherwise afford houses or apartments.
</P>
<P>
James Johnson, chairman of Fannie Mae said that "the investment
plan reflects New York City's unique housing market and needs,
including the low rate of home ownership compared to other parts
of the country."
</P>
<P>
The level of home ownership in New York City is only half of
the national average, which is 60 percent of all American
families.

JERUSALEM, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Four Israeli soldiers were
killed and nine others wounded in clashes with Hezbollah (Party of
God) gunmen in south Lebanon Monday night, reported Israel Radio
today.
</P>
<P>
The casualties were caused as the soldiers ran into a
well-planned ambush. Hezbollah gunmen successfully moved through
the Israeli-occupied "security zone" to take up positions along
the border fence between Israel and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The clash happened at about 8:30 p.m. (18:30 GMT) Monday when a
routine Israeli patrol was making its way along the border
checking that there had been no infiltrations. But the gunmen were
waiting on the Lebanese side of the fence.
</P>
<P>
As the patrol drove by, the waiting gunmen opened fire with a
variety of weapons. One soldier was wounded while the rest began
to return fire and call in reinforcements. The soldiers pursued
the retreating gunmen, only to run into a second stage of the
ambush. A roadside charge exploded, killing four and wounding
eight.
</P>
<P>
Supported by helicopters and tanks, Israeli troops chased the
gunmen killing two. But the third escaped.
</P>
<P>
Among the nine hospitalized soldiers, two were in critical
condition and three were seriously wounded.

<HEADLINE> Stable Rice Price Urged in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- A noted agricultural economist
today urged the Indonesian government to make an all-out effort to
keep rice prices from falling below the official floor price.
</P>
<P>
The economist, Bungaran Saragih, said at a seminar here that
only a stable rice price can protect farmers against unfavorable
market conditions.
</P>
<P>
He said an extremely low price would hurt farmers although it
would be good for the country's rice stock.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bureau of Statistics earlier predicted that
Indonesia's rice production would grow by 3.89 percent in the
current planting season as against the 46.5 million tons the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Some seven million hectares of paddy fields will be ready for
harvesting later this month and the yield is expected to exceed
the country's target stock.
</P>
<P>
Head of the National Logistic Agency (BULOG), Beddu Amang, said
last week that BULOG's warehouses were ready to accommodate all
the rice bought from farmers to keep prices stable.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has had to rely partly on imports for rice supply
since 1993 when floods, droughts and diseases cut its bought down
production after a 10-year-old self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, BULOG has reportedly imported some 3.6 million tons
of rice in the current planting season.

<HEADLINE> Summary of Li Peng's Report At NPC Session (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today
elaborated on a trans-century program for China's national economy
and social development in the next 15 years at a session of the
country's top legislature -- the National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said China aims to quadruple its 1980 per capita GDP by
the year 2000 even while the country's population will have grown
by 300 million in the period. The country will then further double
its year 2000 GDP in another ten years -- by 2010.
</P>
<P>
At the Fourth Session of the Eighth NPC which opened here
today, the premier expounded on An Outline of the Ninth Five-Year
Plan for National Economy and Social Development and Long-Term
Goals for the Year of 2010.
</P>
<P>
He asked the nearly 3,000 NPC deputies to examine his report as
well as the draft of the Outline. He also asked members of the
National Committee of Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference to put forward suggestions.
</P>
<P>
The Outline is based on a proposal of the Central Committee of
the Chinese Communist Party for formulating the Ninth Five-Year
Plan for National Economy and Social Development and long-term
goals for the year of 2010, and opinions from all social circles.
</P>
<P>
Focusing on the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), the outline
also sets forth in broad terms long-term goals for China's
development in the first decade of the next century.
</P>
<P>
This is the country's first medium- and long-term program since
China decided in 1992 to develop a socialist market economy, and
it is the first time China has mapped out a 15-year plan. It is
meant to link up its development at the end of this century with
that at the beginning of the next. The previous eight five-year
plans were all worked out under conditions of central planning.
</P>
<P>
According to the premier, major tasks as defined in the Outline
for the next 15 years include:
</P>
<P>
-- Total grain output will reach 490 billion to 500 billion
kg by the year 2000;
</P>
<P>
-- China will launch a number of large projects in water
conservancy, energy, transportation, telecommunications and
production of important raw materials with concentrated national
resources;
</P>
<P>
-- More importance will be attached to supporting
development in central and western China, with the goal of
narrowing regional gaps;
</P>
<P>
-- In the next five years, China aims to keep its average
annual economic growth rate at eight percent, cut the rate of
price rises below its economic growth rate, and keep the rate of
investment in fixed assests at 30 percent;
</P>
<P>
-- Urban dwellers' per capita income spent on living expenses,
after deducting price rises, is projected to grow by about five
percent each year, and the per capita net income for farmers at
about four percent.
</P>
<P>
With the fulfillment of the objectives set forth in the
outline, Li said, China's productive forces, comprehensive
national strength and people's living standard will be much
higher, which will lay a solid foundation for the realization of
China's modernization by the middle of the next century.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Consumer Price Index Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's year-on-year consumer
price index for February increased by 7.4 percent, which has been
attributed to higher food prices during the Lunar Chinese New Year
holiday.
</P>
<P>
A report released by the government's Business Economic
Department and was available here today said the consumer price
index for February rose by 0.5 percent as compared with January.
</P>
<P>
The consumer price index, a measure of inflation, is based on
prices for a wide basket of key goods and services.
</P>
<P>
Increased demand for food and beverages during the February 19
Chinese New Year holiday was responsible for pushing the consumer
price index higher, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Poultry, vegetables and various seafoods all registered price
increases for last month.
</P>
<P>
Non-food prices, including prices of diesel fuel and service
costs, registered a 4.9 percent rise on a year-on-year basis.
</P>
<P>
The wholesale index increased by 0.7 percent from January and
was up 2.5 percent year-on-year. The index now stands at 152.4.
</P>
<P>
The index for export goods in February was 161.2, down 0.9
percent from January. Prices of industrial products, tapioca
pellets, maize, rubber, and rubber bands all declined.

endangered wild animals, and 300 rare plants, as well as the
primitive ecological system where the animals and plants live.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said they lack 200,000 US dollars to complete
the preparation work.
</P>
<P>
The reserve is the world's highest karst landform above sea
level, with glaciers and snow-covered mountains, dozens of
mountain-based lakes and gold mines.
</P>
<P>
They said the 'no man's land', which is several hundred
kilometers in depth in a plateau basin, is a natural paradise for
wildlife. It is home to wild animals such as the Tibetan wild ass,
Tibetan antelope, wild yaks, wild camels and black-necked cranes,
all given first-priority State protection to help preserve the
species.
</P>
<P>
There are approximately 60,000 Tibetan ass, nearly 80,000
Tibetan antelopes and 10,000 wild yaks.
</P>
<P>
Lei Shimin, a local official who has conducted a fact-finding
survey in the reserve, said he and his colleagues has witnessed a
three-meter-long, one-ton male yak with a pair of one-meter-long
horns.
</P>
<P>
Lei said the yak attacked their jeep, turning it over several
times.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, China has stemmed rampant illegal
gold-digging in the reserve. Gold diggers from neighboring Qinghai
and Gansu provinces caused damage to the reserve's ecological
environment and environmental protection facilities.
</P>
<P>
An Huimin, director of Environmental Protection Bureau of
Xinjiang, said the clamp down over the past two years had reduced
human activities to a level that was harmless to its ecological
system.

<HEADLINE> Russia Firm in Decision to Halt U.S. Poultry Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian officials today reiterated
their decision to suspend poultry imports from the United States
from March 16, disregarding growing pressure from the
U.S. administration.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Vice President Albert Gore, in a letter to Russian Prime
Minister Victor Chernomyrdin, said that Washington was planning
retaliatory measures if Russia stops U.S. poultry imports, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 85 percent of imported chickens in Russia are from
America. One-fifth of U.S. poultry exports, worth 700 million
U.S. dollars annually, go to Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Russian veterinary bureau said its decision stemmed from
the poor quality of imported U.S. chicken and the fear of bringing
poultry diseases into Russia.
</P>
<P>
The bureau urged the U.S. to guarantee the quality of the fowl
in order to meet Russian quarantine requirements.
</P>
<P>
The dispute should be resolved by experts not politicians, and
any attempts to politicize the issue would only delay the
solution, a bureau official warned.

<HEADLINE> Summary of Li Peng's Report At NPC Session (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the process of working out the program, the premier noted,
the State Council put much emphasis on correctly handling
relations between reform, development and stability, promoting
fundamental changes in the economic system and economic growth mode,
and solving major issues that affect the overall progress of
reform and development.
</P>
<P>
The program must reflect requirements for developing a
socialist market economy, Li said.
</P>
<P>
To build such an economy, he said, China will spare no efforts
in promoting reform of its economic system with focus placed
on enterprise reform. One of the goals of reform, he said, is to
have most large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises establish
a modern enterprise system by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
The country will foster a uniform and open market system
favoring fair competition and improve its social security system.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, China will implement its open policy in
greater depth and width, and establish preliminarily a
standardized and uniform external economic system that conforms to
international practices.
</P>
<P>
In the report, Li Peng also put forth proposals on the
implementation of two major development strategies crucial for the
next 15 years and China's modernization drive: a national
revitalization through progresses in science/technology and
education, and a sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the previous two five-year plans, promotion of
socialist cultural and ideological progress, democracy and the
legal system's improvement has a more prominent place in the
program. About one seventh of the 20,000-word report is devoted to
this topic.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin, the Chinese Communist Party general secretary and
head of state, said last year that cultural and ideological
progress should under no circumstances be sacrificed for the sake
of short-term economic growth. Premier Li put equal emphasis
on the point in his report.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of promoting a peaceful reunification of the
Chinese nation, the premier reaffirmed that a change of Taiwan's
status as a part of China is absolutely not allowed. The Chinese
government has always favored a peaceful reunification but does
not commit itself to abandoning the use of force.
</P>
<P>
On the international situation and foreign affairs, Li stressed
that China is a major force in maintaining world peace and
regional stability, and its development and growth in strength
will never be a threat to any other country.
</P>
<P>
Major tasks set forth for the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995)
period have been accomplished in time or ahead of schedule. During
the period, annual GDP growth averaged 12 percent, the highest
since the founding of New China, he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier called on governments at all levels to make a good
beginning of the Ninth Five-Year Plan this year.

<HEADLINE> China Imposes No Threat to Others: Li Peng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- China will continue unswervingly
to pursue an independent foreign policy of peace, develop friendly
relations of cooperation with all other countries and work for the
establishment of a just and rational new international political
and economic order, Chinese Premier Li Peng said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Fourth Session of the Eighth National People's
Congress (NPC) which opened today, Li said that in international
affairs China will, as always, decide its position and policies
for each case on its own merits.
</P>
<P>
"China will not enter into alliance with any big power or bloc
of countries, nor will it handle state-to-state relations by
making ideology or social system the criteria," he said. "China
firmly opposes one country interfering in the internal affairs of
another country with excuses based on issues of nationality,
religion or human rights."
</P>
<P>
It is clear to any unbiased person that China is an important
force for safeguarding world peace and regional stability. China's
development and growth constitute a contribution to world peace
and the progress of mankind; China will absolutely not pose a
threat to any country, he said.
</P>
<P>
China will, as always, pursue a good-neighborly policy,
maintain peace and stability and promote economic cooperation in
the Asia-Pacific region, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We shall develop our friendly relations of cooperation with
ASEAN countries. We shall maintain and promote our traditional
friendship with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. We
shall strengthen our cooperation with the Republic of Korea on the
basis of equality and mutual benefit. We shall develop long-term,
stable friendly relations with Japan while keeping in mind that
past experience, if not forgotten, can serve as a guide for the
future. We shall continue to develop friendly cooperation with
Russia and attach importance to letting the two economies
complement each other. We shall develop good relations with
Central Asian and other CIS countries. We shall continue to
develop friendly cooperative relations with countries in Southeast
Asia, South Asia and the South Pacific region as well as with all
neighboring countries," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Li said that it is a fundamental position in China's diplomatic
policy to strengthen solidarity and cooperation with the great
number of Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
"Efforts should be made to further intensify exchanges with
leaders of these countries so as to deepen mutual understanding,
and to increase consultation and cooperation on international
issues," he said. "China will continue to provide developing
countries with assistance to the full extent of its capacity and
to explore new ways of developing mutually complementary economic,
trade, scientific and technological cooperation."
</P>
<P>
China is ready to further friendly relations of cooperation
with European and all other countries, expanding economic, trade,
scientific and technological cooperation with them on the basis of
seeking common ground while putting aside differences and of
equality and mutual benefit, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China has all along been opposed to the arms
race and in favor of real disarmament. China will continue to
take an active part in talks aimed at concluding a
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and will take practical steps to
promote international arms control and disarmament.

BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The maintaining of normal
relations between China and the United States not only complies
with the fundamental interest of the two peoples, but also
contributes to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and
in the world at large, Premier Li Peng said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Fourth Session of the Eighth National People's
Congress (NPC) which opened today, Li said that Sino-US relations
have undergone serious difficulties, which were entirely due to
the unwise China policy of the United States. Thanks to the
efforts of the two sides, their relations have improved to some
extent but are still subjected to fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
The question of Taiwan has always been the most sensitive and
important issue in the Sino-U.S. relations, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Only when the principles enunciated in the three Sino-US joint
communiques are strictly observed and only when the two sides
respect each other and refrain from interfering in each other's
internal affairs will Sino-U.S. relations achieve sound
development," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng reiterated
today that under no circumstances shall the status of Taiwan as
part of China be changed.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government and people are determined and able to
safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the
motherland and would never allow the secession of Taiwan from the
motherland," he said. "No attempt to split the motherland will
succeed."
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark while addressing the Fourth Session of the
Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
"The question of Taiwan is China's internal affair, and China
will brook no interference by outside forces under whatever
pretext and in whatever form," he said. "We are in favor of and
have consistently been working for peaceful reunification, but we
shall not undertake to renounce the use of force."
</P>
<P>
"That we shall not undertake to renounce the use of force is
not directed against our compatriots in Taiwan, but against the
schemes of foreign forces to interfere with China's reunification
and to bring about the `independence of Taiwan,'" he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, thanks to the efforts of compatriots on
both sides of the Taiwan Straits, personal contacts and economic
and cultural exchanges between the two sides have developed
considerably, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It has been our consistent stand to end the separation between
the two sides of the Taiwan Straits and accomplish the great cause
of the peaceful reunification of the motherland in accordance with
the principles of `peaceful reunification' and `one country, two
systems,'" Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the eight-point proposal on promoting the
reunification of the motherland put forward by President Jiang
Zemin has won warm acclaim from Chinese people at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
"Our struggle against attempts by some leading members of
the Taiwan authorities to create `two Chinas' or `one China, one
Taiwan' and to bring about the `independence of Taiwan'
demonstrates our determination and ability to safeguard state
sovereignty and territorial integrity," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We pin our hope on people in Taiwan and sincerely appeal
to all Chinese including our compatriots in Taiwan to unite and
strive for an early reunification of the motherland," the premier
said.

<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
that China is making good preparations for resuming its exercise
of sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark while delivering a report at the Fourth
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), which
opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) under the NPC has been established and
concrete preparations for the establishment of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region have begun. This is a great event in
China's effort towards resuming its exercise of sovereignty over
Hong Kong, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that the Preparatory Committee will heed the
opinions of people from all walks of life in Hong Kong and
successfully accomplish its glorious and sacred historic mission
of effecting a smooth transfer of government in Hong Kong," he
said.
</P>
<P>
China will resume its exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on
July 1, 1997 and Macao on December 20, 1999. "This will be an
important milestone in our effort to achieve the reunification of
the motherland," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will, as always, implement the principle
of "one country, two systems" and make all preparations necessary
to this end in accordance with the Basic Law of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region and the Basic Law of the Macao
Special Administrative Region, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to strengthen our cooperation with the British
and Portuguese governments on the basis of the Sino-British Joint
Declaration and the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration so as to
achieve a smooth transfer of government and maintain long-term
prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macao," the premier
said.
</P>
<P>
After China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong
and Macao, the current social and economic systems in Hong Kong
and Macao will remain unchanged. They will enjoy a high degree of
autonomy, and will retain their status as free ports, and Hong
Kong will retain its status as an international financial, trade
and shipping center, he said.

<HEADLINE> Shenyang City Aiming for Cleaner Air </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- One of the most polluted cities in
the world, Shenyang, in China's industrial northeast has become
the first Chinese city to begin curbing air pollution, today's
"China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
New regulations, which came into force last Friday, call for
enterprises to apply for permission from the local environment
protection bureau before discharging waste air.
</P>
<P>
The regulations also restrict the time allowed for the
discharge of waste air, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
Firms will be charged for emitting sulphur dioxide, and the
local environmental protection departments have the right to order
units at and below municipal level to solve their pollution
problems within certain time limits.
</P>
<P>
The local environmental protection agencies are also entitled
to close down units which are causing pollution in the city.
</P>
<P>
Shenyang, in Liaoning Province, is a very important industrial
city. It has suffered serious air pollution resulting from the use
of coal as the main fuel for many years. The World Health
Organization(WHO) has monitored the quality of the atmosphere in
70 big cities across the world in recent years, and Shenyang has
been found to be one of the 10 most seriously polluted.
</P>
<P>
The State Law on Preventing and Controlling Air Pollution took
effect last August, making it urgent for provincial governments to
work out corresponding local regulation.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the regulation has set a good example for
other cities in combating air pollution, according to Zhao Weijun,
an official with the National Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
Hebei Province was busy working on the draft of similar
regulations. In Shanghai the local environmental protection
regulations which were publicized last May have included
stimulations on how to curb air pollution, taking the related
State law into account.

<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Keeping government employees
honest and industrious and combatting corruption is a long-term
and arduous task that has a bearing on the success of China's
modernization drive, Chinese Premier Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark when he explained the country's Ninth
Five-year Plan (1996-2000) for national economic and social
development and the long-term target for the year 2010 at the
Fourth Session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC),
China's top legislature, which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
"Government organs, departments under the State Council in
particular, should set an example by performing their duties
honestly and conscientiously accepting supervision," he said.
</P>
<P>
Leading cadres, especially high-ranking officials, should do
the same. Leaders of state-owned enterprises and undertakings
should act judiciously and abide by the law, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We should investigate cases of law and disciplinary
violations, especially major cases, and resolutely put an end to
unhealthy tendencies in government departments, trades and
professions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Those who abuse their power for personal gains and commit
bribery or accept bribes in violation of the law should, without
fail and regardless of rank, be punished according to law," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He urged officials at various levels to improve judicial work,
supervision and auditing. "We should establish and improve a
system of guarantees under which government employees are honest
and industrious, improve supervision and inspection, and
intensively conduct ideological education, seeking both temporary
and permanent solutions so as to prevent and eliminate
corruption."
</P>
<P>
Public servants should keep in close touch with the people.
They should avoid a bureaucratic style of work, formalism or
deception and be on guard against boasting and exaggeration. They
should improve their competence, work diligently, refrain from
indulging in empty talk and serve the people wholeheartedly so as
to promote fine government conduct and bring about a turn for the
better in the general conduct of society, he noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng emphasized
the importance of ethical and cultural progress when he addressed
the Fourth Session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC),
which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
"We must never seek temporary economic development at the cost
of cultural and ideological progress," he said in his report
on the country's Ninth Five-year Plan (1996-2000) for national
economic and social development and the long-term target for the
year 2010.
</P>
<P>
He said socialist culture and ideology include education,
science, culture and ethics. Governments at all levels should
incorporate the development of socialist culture and ideology into
their overall plans for social development, increase investments
and provide material guarantees to this end, and conscientiously
attach equal importance to economic development and the
development of socialist culture and ideology.
</P>
<P>
"In the process of developing a market economy and at a time
when various ideologies and cultures in the world interact, it is
of particular importance to develop socialist culture and
ideology," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
He said ethical progress determines the nature and orientation
of cultural and ideological developments. "We must make
unremitting efforts to educate cadres and other people in Deng
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, foster common ideals and aspirations and further
the cohesiveness of the nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We should continue to vigorously conduct education in
patriotism, collectivism and socialism, arm people's minds with
scientific theory, guide them with correct public opinion, remould
them with lofty ideals, inspire them with excellent literary works
and train socialist citizens who have lofty ideals, moral
integrity, a good education and a strong sense of discipline," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We should emphasize the importance of education in social,
occupational and family ethics, and develop interpersonal
relationships of equality, unity, fraternal love and mutual aid.
We should carry on the fine tradition of working hard to build up
the country and being diligent and thrifty, oppose extravagance
and waste, advocate scientific, civilized and healthy lifestyles
and create a society with high ethical standards," he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier called on people to carry forward the traditional
virtues of the Chinese nation, draw on the achievements of human
civilization and resist the corrosion of decadent capitalist and
feudal ideas.

<HEADLINE> China Strives for Sustained Economic Expansion: Li Peng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said that
in the coming 15 years China will control population growth and
protect resources and the environment so as to achieve a
coordinated and sustained economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to publicize its family planning program in
order to enhance the nation's awareness of the population problem,
he said.
</P>
<P>
At the Fourth Session of the Eighth National People's Congress
which opened here today, Li delivered a report on the country's
Ninth Five-year Plan (1996-2000) for National Economic and Social
Development and the Long-term Target for the Year 2010.
</P>
<P>
China's goal is to keep the total population under 1.3 billion
by the year 2000 and under 1.4 billion by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Talking about environmental and ecological protection, and
rational exploration and utilization of resources, Li said that
China's per capita share of arable land, water, forests and some
mineral resources is below the world average.
</P>
<P>
Since China is on a rapid industrialization course and has
adopted methods of extensive production and operation, waste of
natural resources and environmental pollution are quite serious,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
With population growth and economic development, this problem
will become even worse, he said. Therefore, the state will make
greater efforts to conserve and rationally develop and use natural
resources, including land, water, forests, grasslands, minerals
and biological resources according to law, and do the best to
reduce waste.
</P>
<P>
"We should improve the system of paid use and pricing of
natural resources as quickly as possible and establish systems for
economic compensation for the renewal of natural resources. We
should adhere to the policy of synchronizing the planning,
implementation and progress of economic development, urban and
rural construction and environmental protection, and ensure that
all construction projects meet requirements for environmental
protection," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
He urged governments at all levels to tighten environmental
management according to law and, in particular, effectively
control and deal with industrial pollution and improve the urban
environment.
</P>
<P>
"We should actively develop ecological agriculture, accelerate
the comprehensive control of soil and water loss in afflicted
areas, strengthen the improvement of grasslands and sand
prevention and control, control pollution of farmland and water
and strive to improve the ecological environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, China plans to bring under initial control
aggravating pollution and ecological damage, and environmental
quality in some cities and areas should have improved to some
extent, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Ninth Five-year Plan (1996-2000) for National Economic and
Social Development and the Long-term Target for the Year 2010
(draft) consists of 11 parts. The ninth part, entitled
Implementing Sustained Development Strategy to Promote Overall
Social Development, makes special explanations on the
protection and exploration of the state's land resources,
environmental and ecological protection, urban and rural
construction, and various issues concerning culture, public health
and physical culture.
</P>
<P>
The draft, together with the report by Li Peng, will be
examined by deputies at the NPC session.

<HEADLINE> Russia Slams U.S. on Toughened Sanctions Against Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Russia today condemned the United
States for toughening its economic embargo against Cuba over
its downing of two U.S. civilian planes last week.
</P>
<P>
"Russia as well as most countries in the world view the
economic embargo against Cuba and even more steps to toughen it as
contradictory to international law and curbing the rights of
sovereign states," the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement referred to the so-called Helms-Burton bill,
named after its sponsors, which aims to deter the flow of foreign
investment into Cuba.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton has said he will cooperate to see the
bill passed as part of a package of punitive sanctions against
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Canada, the European Union and Mexico, all close allies of
the United States which trade with Cuba, have already told
Washington they oppose the bill.
</P>
<P>
The Russian ministry is disappointed at the U.S. move which
directly damages the economic interests of Russia and other
countries, and is very concerned at the tense relations between
the United States and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
It said Russia builds its relations with Cuba on
non-ideological grounds, on the basis of (Russian) national
interests.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian Federation will expand its trade and economic
relations with this country strictly on the basis of equality and
mutual benefit." the ministry added in the statement.

<HEADLINE> China to Be Reinvigorated through Science and Education: Li Peng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said today
that China will give priority to the development of education in
the coming 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark at the Fourth Session of the National
People's Congress (NPC) while delivering a report on the country's
Ninth Five-year Plan (1996-2000) for national economic and social
development and the long-term target for the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
"Economic development must rely on science and technology, and
our work in science and technology must be adapted to the needs of
economic development," he said.
</P>
<P>
First, China will promote the development of technologies and
spread their use, promote the commercialization of scientific and
technological achievements and put them to use in production,
combine development of technology through the effort with
introduction and assimilation of overseas advanced technology and
concentrate on solving problems concerning major and key
technologies affecting our economic and social development, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Second, China will vigorously develop high and new technologies
and the related industries, striving to approach or reach the
world's most advanced level in some important areas, and transform
traditional industries with new and high technology.
</P>
<P>
Third, China will strengthen basic research, scale the heights
of scientific and technological development in fields on the
cutting edge of science and technology and try to effect
breakthroughs in areas where the country enjoys superiority, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In proceeding with social undertakings, China will step up
research and application of new technologies in such areas as
family planning, prevention and treatment of major diseases,
environmental protection, multiple use and recycling of resources
and the prevention and reduction of natural calamities, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"We should deepen the reform of the management systems in
science and technology and accelerate the integration of
scientific research, development and production with the market,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We should facilitate association between research institutes,
institutions of higher learning and enterprises," he said. "Large
enterprises should be encouraged to establish technology
development centers and to become the main force in the
development of technology."
</P>
<P>
Further efforts should be made to protect intellectual property
rights and give scope to the role of the patent system, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that making education a priority and improving the
cultural level of the entire population is a task of long-term
importance. China will make nine-year compulsory education
universal and eliminate in the main illiteracy among young and
middle-aged people by the year 2000 throughout China, ensure the
funding and teachers required for this purpose, and increase
financial support to poverty-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, China will develop higher education as
appropriate and focus on improving instruction and raising the
overall efficiency and concentrate on a number of institutions of
higher learning and disciplines. Vigorous efforts will be made to
develop different types and levels of vocational and adult
education. The state will also optimize the educational structure
so that regular and vocational education develop proportionately.
</P>
<P>
The premier urged officials at various levels to accelerate
educational reform and explore systems and models of running
schools which meet the requirements of reform and development at
the current stage.
</P>
<P>
He said the state encourages non-governmental sectors to run
schools and gradually establish a new educational system which
will be primarily government-run but will include schools operated
by different sectors of society, and the state promotes various
forms of joint operation and management of schools and rationally
allocate resources for education.
</P>
<P>
All types of schools at all levels must improve ideological and
political education. Efforts should be made to focus on
consolidating the ranks of teachers, improving teacher competence
and improving teachers' work, study and living conditions, he
said.

<HEADLINE> China to Open Still Wider to Outside World: Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- China will open still wider to the
outside world in the coming five years known as China's Ninth
Five-Year Plan period (1996--2000), Chinese premier Li Peng said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks in his report delivered at the Fourth
Session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), which
opened today.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period, he said, China should
establish in the main a unified and standardized system of foreign
economic affairs in line with generally accepted international
practices in the economic field in order to meet the requirements
of developing a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
The Special Economic Zones should scale new heights by
achieving still more and better results. All Special Economic
Zones and open coastal cities and areas should actively engage in
international economic cooperation and serve as an example and a
driving force for economic development in surrounding areas and
the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
Those areas along main communications lines, the Yangtze River
and borders as well as those major cities in the hinterland, he
said, should bring their own advantages into full play,
effectively promote opening-up and stimulate economic development
and invigoration.
</P>
<P>
He announced China will gradually open the domestic market as
required by reform and development, particularly such services as
finance, commercial outlets and tourism..
</P>
<P>
China will continue to use foreign funds actively, rationally
and effectively, with emphasis placed on better results and higher
levels, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The country will gradually give foreign-funded enterprises the
same treatment as their Chinese counterparts, standardize the
taxation system and levy taxes that are fair and reasonable to
both Chinese and foreign enterprises, thus creating conditions for
them to compete on an equal footing. Active efforts should be made
to guide and channel foreign funds to basic projects in the areas
of energy, communications and agriculture and to the technical
transformation of old enterprises, he continued.
</P>
<P>
In his report, the Chinese premier criticized some Western
nations to exclude China out of the World Trade Organization
(WTO). Developing economic and technological cooperation with
foreign countries not only benefits China but also greatly
contributes to the world's economic development, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Some Western countries are bent on excluding China from the
World Trade Organization. Their actions run counter to the
purposes of this international organization and also impair its
universality and impartiality," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the development of special economic zones, Li Peng said the
state's basic policy for the Special Economic Zones and the
Shanghai Pudong New Area will remain unchanged, while certain
readjustments and improvements will be made in some specific rules
and regulations in the course of developing a socialist market
economy.

When an enterprise acts as the major investor, the enterprise
and the financial institution undertake the risk and liability for
the investment. When a government organization or social welfare
organization acts as the major investor, its risks and liabilities
must also be defined. In the future, for incipient production and
operational projects, the legal persons should be held
responsible. The state will invite public bidding for new key
construction projects and select legal persons for the projects
through fair competition. disparity in distribution.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period, China must step up the
reform of the old-age insurance, unemployment insurance and health
insurance systems, he said.
</P>
<P>
China must also establish a multi-tiered social security system
which is compatible with China's national conditions by developing
relief programs, social welfare, undertakings which provide
special care and jobs for disabled servicemen and family members
of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen, and social mutual
assistance, and by encouraging personal savings, he said.

The expenses for old-age and health insurance
for staff and workers in cities and towns shall be borne jointly

</P>
<P>
Efforts must be made to develop commercial insurance to give
full scope to its supplementary role in social security.
Unemployment insurance coverage shall be enlarged by establishing
a system combining unemployment compensation with re-employment
opportunities. Social security funds of different types should be
raised from a variety of channels, attentively managed and put to
good use.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels should earnestly alter their
functions according to the requirements of developing a socialist
market economy, separating their administrative functions from
enterprise management, and raise their managerial level. The
Central Government should employ mainly economic means as well as
legal means supplemented by necessary administrative means to
exercise macro-control over the national economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li called for further efforts to be made to readjust and reform the
government setup, gradually transforming comprehensive economic
departments into authoritative macro-control organs with unified
functions and gradually turning specialized economic management
departments into economic entities without government functions,
into state-authorized firms engaged in operating state assets, or
into management organizations of various trades. Other government
departments should also make rational adjustments.

<HEADLINE> China to Accelerate Economic Restructuring: Li Peng (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his report delivered at the Fourth Session of the Eighth
National People's Congress (NPC), which opened here today, Li
elaborated the principles and policies concerning economic
restructuring in five pages of his 43-page report.
</P>
<P>
It is the crux of the matter to initially setting up a
socialist system of market economy to establish a modern
enterprise system and do a good job in the reform and development
of state-owned enterprises, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the reform of state-owned enterprises, he said, China must
aim at running well state-owned economy as a whole. It must give
priority to key points and provide specific instructions.
</P>
<P>
The state must, with concentrated efforts, do well in the
reform and development of 1,000 large state-owned enterprises and
enterprise groups in the near future, transforming them into
corporate entities and market competitors that operate
independently, assume responsibility for their own profits and
losses, and exercise self-restraint in their own development so
that they can play a backbone role in national economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier urged the central and local governments to
conduct experiment of enterprise reforms with some breakthroughs
to be made in the focal points and difficult issues. Efforts must
be made to combine pilot urban reform projects with the reform of
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that China should reinvigorate smaller state-owned
enterprises by way of re-organization, association, merger into
joint stock partnership, leasing, contractual operation or
sell-out, as their specific circumstances permit.
</P>
<P>
To realize the principle of "selecting the superior and
eliminating the inferior," the state will appropriate a special
fund during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period to encourage the
merging of enterprises, offset debts incurred by bankrupt
enterprises, he added.
</P>
<P>
Li emphasized the importance of cultivating a unified and open
market system with orderly competition. Positive but cautious
steps must be taken to foster a comparatively perfect money market
as well as markets in such key areas as real estate, labor,
technology and information.
</P>
<P>
Li called on localities to further renovate the investment
system. China shall establish the major investor system and
gradually develop fund-raising through the market, he added.

<HEADLINE> China to Set Average Annual Economic Growth Rate 8 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- China has set the objectives of
macroeconomic control for the Ninth Five-Year Plan period to about
8 percent average annual economic growth, a 30 percent rate of
investment in fixed assets, and a marked drop in the margin of
price rises, Chinese premier said here today.
</P>
<P>
In his report delivered at the Fourth Session of the Eighth
National People's Congress (NPC) which opened here today, Li Peng
said such objectives have been set based on the overall analysis
of conditions in all sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
He said China will continue to tighten and improve
macroeconomic control and regulation and strive to maintain
macroeconomic stability.
</P>
<P>
Li warned that the present price rise margin is still on the
high side. This, in addition to the continued efforts required to
rationalize prices during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period, will
result in heavy pressures in respect to price rises.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, China must make inflation control the
number one task in our macroeconomic control in order to avoid big
fluctuations in the economy.
</P>
<P>
In a speech last September, Li said, "To maintain a stable
macroeconomic development, achieve the basic balance between total
social demand and supply and curb price hikes to the limit which
can be tolerated by various sectors of social life are important
issues in China's development, reform and social stability.
</P>
<P>
To maintain a stable macroeconomic development, Li urged
localities to maintain a reasonable scale of investment in fixed
assets and in on-going construction projects, intensify adjustment
of the investment structure and increase investment returns.
Efforts must be made to continue the appropriately tight financial
and monetary policies.
</P>
<P>
He told deputies present at today's conference that the state
is now experiencing financial difficulties. As a first step in
ameliorating this financial situation, China must continue its
efforts to improve the taxation system, readjust certain tax
rates, broaden the basis of tax sources, abrogate tax reductions
and exemptions, strengthen tax collection and management, increase
income and cut down spending, gradually reduce deficits and
realize a basic balance in revenue and expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Li urged localities to make further efforts to control the
total money supply as appropriate so as to maintain a stable
currency. China must adjust restructure of loans in accordance
with industrial policies and credit principles, and increase
efficiency in the use of funds. China must maintain an approximate
equilibrium of balance of payments and further enhance its
capacity to make international payments.

<HEADLINE> Italian Journalists Strike Over Soccer Coverage Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Italian Journalists of the public
broadcaster RAI went on a nationwide strike Monday to protest
against the loss of their soccer coverage rights for the next
three seasons to their private rivals.
</P>
<P>
The Italian league, which groups 38 soccer teams across the
country, decided last Thursday to award the 1996-1998 rights to
media magnate Vittorio Cecchi Gori, who owns the Telemontecarlo TV
channel, for 213.5 billion Italian lira (about 133 million
U.S. dollars) per season for television alone.
</P>
<P>
News bulletins were shortened to five minutes today as a result
of the strike, organized by the journalist union Singrai at RAI
and the national union of journalists Usigrai, which accused the
league of putting financial interests before those of the public.
</P>
<P>
Telemontecarlo, which has only a minimal slice of Italy's
television audience, is not widely available either in the country
or abroad. Italians normally follow soccer matches on RAI.
</P>
<P>
Around 20 million Italians, 35 percent of the country's
population, watch or listen to soccer programs each weekend.
</P>
<P>
Fearing that they might not be able to watch soccer programs in
the next three years, they called for a nationalization of
television and radio coverage rights of soccer matches in the
country.

<P>
BUDAPEST, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Hungarian Democratic Forum,
the biggest opposition party with 38 seats in parliament, will
break into two this week following fierce inner-party struggles.
</P>
<P>
Ivan Szabo, the forum leader in parliament, announced today
that he is forming a new party, the Hungarian Democratic People's
Party, with some other lawmakers from the Forum.
</P>
<P>
The new party will be registered in a couple of days, Szabo
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Szabo lost his contest for the forum's top leadership Saturday
in its 10th national convention. He was defeated by Sandor Lezsak
by 269-400.
</P>
<P>
Szabo said the new party will take over some of the forum's
parliamentary seats under relevant rules and cooperate with the
forum truly and friendly.
</P>
<P>
It is better to see two parties cooperate with each other
rather than two factions wrangle within one party, he added.
</P>
<P>
The forum was formed by three factions in 1988. The new party
comes from the fraction with Christian democratic
characteristics.

<HEADLINE> More Attention to be Paid to Central, Western Regions: Premier  (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Li Peng, in his report today, elaborated that disparity in
development of different regions is a basic condition in China. It
is also a universal law describing the economic development of a
big country.
</P>
<P>
Since the implementation of the reform and opening up, Li said,
all regions in the country have achieved much development of their
economies. But as the speed of grouth has varied, the disparities
among the regions have been widened to some extent, Li said.
</P>
<P>
To promote a coordinated development of regional economies, Li
said, the general requirement in this regard is to correctly
handle the relationships between the overall development of the
national economy and the development of regional economies, and to
correctly handle the relationships between the efforts to develop
regional economies and the efforts to give full scope to the
initiatives of all provinces (municipalities and autonomous
regions) in accordance with the principles of unified planning and
overall arrangements, proceeding from actual conditions,
displaying advantages and advocating division of labor and
coordinated development.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier urged localities to make further
efforts to establish and develop a number of economic zones that
transcend administrative boundaries, with major cities and vital
communication lines as the basis, according to the laws governing
the market economy,.
</P>
<P>
Fundamentally speaking, to allow regions capable of development
to progress faster is favorable for enhancing the economic
strength of the country and for helping backward regions in
developing their economies, he said.
</P>
<P>
The eastern part of the country should utilize its advantages
and provide new experience for the nation concerning changing the
mode of economic growth, upgrading industrial structure,
developing an export-oriented economy and promoting a healthier
development of the economy, the Chinese premier said.

<P>
HAVANA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Council of Churches of Cuba
blamed the United States today for the incident in which two small
American planes were shot down by a Cuban fighter on February 24.
</P>
<P>
The council said in a statement that U.S. authorities
irresponsibly allowed the two planes to invade Cuban airspace and
urged the U.S. government to prevent a repetition of such
incident.
</P>
<P>
The council also demanded that the U.S. end its embargo against
Cuba, which has lasted for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
"The reason behind such incident is the continuation of the
U.S. embargo against Cuba and the manipulation of the issue for
U.S. domestic political purposes," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Cuba downed two unarmed civilian aircraft owned by the Cuban
exile group Brothers to the Rescue on February 24, killing all
four crew members.
</P>
<P>
Tension between Havana and Washington flared following the
incident. U.S. President Bill Clinton announced the tightening of
economic sanctions against the Caribbean island, canceling all
chartered flights between the two countries and penalizing any
third country investing in Cuba.

<HEADLINE> More Attention to Be Paid to Central, Western Regions: Premier (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- China will pay more attention to
the development of its midwestern parts, introduce policies
conducive to slowing down the widening of regional disparities and
strive to narrow them, said Chinese premier Li Peng today.
</P>
<P>
In his report delivered at the Fourth Session of the Eighth
National People's Congress (NPC), which opened here today, Li
listed several major policies and measures to be adopted by the
central government in the coming five years:
</P>
<P>
-- Stepping up resources surveying in the central and western
parts of the country, giving priority to resource development and
infrastructure projects and gradually increasing financial support
to these regions and the investment in their construction;
</P>
<P>
-- Adjusting the distribution of the processing industries by
guiding the transfer of resource-processing and labor-intensive
industries to the central and western parts of the country;
rationalizing the prices of resources products so as to enhance
the self-development capabilities of the central and western
regions;
</P>
<P>
-- Improving the investment environment in the central and
western parts of the country and directing more foreign investment
towards these regions;
</P>
<P>
-- Strengthening economic association and cooperation between
the eastern and the central, western parts of the country;
encouraging to invest more in the central and western parts and
directing talented personnel flow towards the central and western
regions.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that the central and western parts of the country have
a great potential for development. So long as they accelerate the
pace of reform and opening up and invigorate their economies, they
can certainly speed up development and some of them may even
overtake the currently more developed regions.
</P>
<P>
On the disparities in development between different regions,
Deng Xiaoping once said,"China should bring the issue into
attention and try to solve it when we live a relatively more
comfortable life at the end of this century."

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Traditional Culture During Spring Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Although commercial and foreign
cultural elements have taken up part of the country's cultural
market in recent years, people find that China's traditional
culture, especially folk culture, is still the most suitable for
the Spring Festival activities.
</P>
<P>
The Spring Festival is the lunar new year and the most
important holiday for Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
On the New Year's Eve people living away from home return to
celebrate the holiday with their parents and eat jiaozi, a holiday
food which symbolizes good luck. MacDonalds, greeting cards and
telephone calls have not yet displaced this ancient tradition.
</P>
<P>
During this year's Spring Festival, which fell February 19,
this capital city of China became a big stage to display
traditional Chinese culture, which is being re-discovered and
accepted by more and more young people.
</P>
<P>
Lanterns, New Year scrolls and paper-cuts in red (a lucky
color), were warmly welcomed again by travelers and local
residents. At the folk fairs, even some traditional toys such as
diabolo became popular again.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that admissions to the seven-day Longtanhu Fair
totalled over 1.2 million, two-thirds of whom were young
people. Performances of folk skills and local operas, and snacks
of local flavors deeply impressed the fair visitors.
</P>
<P>
It was noticeable that the performances of local operas were
better welcomed than modern singing and dancing programs in the
state-organized artistic shows for farmers. In the countryside,
traditional arts play a significant role, with strong support from
farmers.
</P>
<P>
People find the special value of Chinese traditional culture in
entertainment and social virtues when they celebrate this
traditional holiday.
</P>
<P>
Western holidays, shop-signs and trade marks have been
excessively admired by some commercial organizations and young
people since the 1980s. This so-called "cultural colonialization"
has been attacked in speeches by Ji Xianlin and Jin Kemu, leading
professors of Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
The "Guangming Daily", a leading newspaper in China, is
conducting a discussion on the topic of "cultural
colonialization". Scholars agree that traditional culture can be
used to cultivate national identity, traditional virtues and
patriotism.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Yefu, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, said that the world has stepped into the information
age, but this does not mean that a country should open to the
outside world without any limit.
</P>
<P>
In fact, many countries, including some developed countries in
the West, are exerting efforts to protect their national culture,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The popularization of Chinese cultural research and the urgent
demand for ancient books and records in recent years has shown
that traditional culture can also bring great economic benefits.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile many department stores have begun to use folk arts to
lure customers.
</P>
<P>
In addition, to develop traditional culture, Beijing has
revived temple fairs, set up a museum of folk arts and refurbished
a group of historical sites such as the "Old Tianqiao" and the
"Liulichang" since the mid-1980s.

China should protect farmland, improve its basic farmland
protection system, and cherish and make good use of every square
inch of available land. An organic integration of crop farming,
breeding and processing in rural areas is to be encouraged so as
to promote the integration of agriculture, industry and trade, and
the development of an agriculture aimed at high yield, fine
quality and high efficiency, he said.
</P>
<P>
The country should make a success of a comprehensive
development of agriculture and promote an all-round development of
forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production and fishery. The
central and local governments should increase their input in
agriculture, encouraging and directing rural collectives,
individual peasants and all other quarters of society to invest
more in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"We must fully engage our rural human resources in farmland
improvement projects, water conservancy projects and in road
construction and afforestation, so as to improve conditions for
rural economic development," said the premier.
</P>
<P>
Ensuring a sustained and stable growth in agriculture and the
rural economy as a whole is very important and the most difficult
task in China's economic development over the next 15 years, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The development of township and village enterprises is a great
innovation of the Chinese peasants, " said the premier, adding
that reform and development of township and village enterprises is
an important means for promoting a flourishing rural economy and
for increasing employment and income for the peasants.
</P>
<P>
China should continue to deepen rural reforms and stabilize and
improve the household-based farming system. Agricultural
production and operation at a proper scale should be introduced
step by step in places where conditions are ripe.
</P>
<P>
Further efforts should be made to rationalize the prices of
agricultural produce and establish and improve a market system for
agricultural products centering around wholesale markets, he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier also urged the nation to actively develop the rural
public service system and successfully run such cooperative
economic entities as supply and marketing cooperatives and credit
cooperatives so as to constantly expand the collective economy,
strictly implement the current policies and take effective
measures to lighten farmers' burdens, steadily increase their
income, and arouse and protect their initiative.

<HEADLINE> Sichuan Leads Western Regions in Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Sichuan has become the leading
western Chinese region for overseas investments.
</P>
<P>
Official information show that during the period from 1991 to
1995, overseas businesses invested 4.71 billion US dollars on
5,562 joint ventures in the province.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents an increase of more than 2.6 times
compared with the previous five years.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 alone, the province used 1.7 billion US dollars in
overseas capital, 51 percent up from the year before.
</P>
<P>
Provincial officials attributed the success to their arduous
efforts in improving the local investment environment. The
province now has over 50 economic and technological development
zones, and has spend tens of billions of yuan on traffic schemes,
telecommunications, energy and other infrastructure facilities.
</P>
<P>
It has also simplified the procedures for approving
overseas-funded enterprises, and lifted restrictions on foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to improvements in the investment environment, Sichuan's
overseas-funded enterprises have enjoyed good economic results.
Government statistics show that the 2,200 overseas-funded
businesses that went into operation in the past five years now
have an annual sales volume of 10 billion yuan and an annual
export of more than 100 million US dollars. They have become an
important part in the Sichuan economy.

<HEADLINE> China Can Solve Its Food Problem: Li Peng (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- China can solve its food problem
by relying on its own efforts thanks to its great potential for
increasing grain production, said Chinese Premier Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
In his report on China's development plans delivered at the
Fourth Session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC),
which opened here today, Li said China must ensure that its total
grain output reach 490-500 billion kilograms by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
China must feed 22 percent of the world's population with its
arable land which accounts for only seven percent of the world's
total. This has made grain production especially important, he
said.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to have an additional 14 million people each
year before the end of the century. The government planned last year
to raise the country's annual grain output by 50 billion kilograms
in less than six years in accordance with per capita grain demand in
the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991--2000).
</P>
<P>
In a speech last September, the Chinese premier warned local
officials that grain supply is limited on the world market, making
it impossible for China to import large amounts of grain. Some
imports are merely serving to readjust varieties and increase
storage, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must be aware of the seriousness of the grain issue, but we
should not be pessimistic," said Li.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng has listed a number of measures to invigorate
agriculture: relying on science and education and popularizing a
series of effective, advanced and applicable techniques;
strengthening efforts to tame big rivers and lakes and dredge
medium-sized and small rivers in order to enhance our flood and
drought preparedness capabilities; making great efforts to
transform medium- and low-yielding farmland and building up grain
and cotton production bases in Heilongjiang, Xinjiang and the
Huanghe-Huaihe-Haihe basin.
</P>
<P>
Other measures listed by the premier in his government work
report include: continuing to assist areas which grow grain and
cotton in large amounts in developing their economies;
accelerating the development of industries that serve agricultural
production in order to increase the supply of farming-related
capital goods and improve farm mechanization and modernization;
and persisting in and improving the system of provincial governors
assuming responsibility for the "rice bag" and the system of city
mayors assuming responsibility for the supply of meat, vegetables
and other non-staple foods.

<P>
How to strengthen agriculture as the foundation of the economy;
how to do well in the reform and development of state-owned
enterprises; how to control inflation and maintain macro-economic
stability; how to develop education, science and technology; how
to control population growth and protect resources and the
environment; how to narrow regional disparities in development and
rationalize income distribution; how to strengthen socialist
culture and ideology, democracy and the legal system; how to
promote an honest and industrious government and fight corruption;
and how to improve all facets of public security, these are all
major issues that need to be accorded attention in reform and
development, he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the premier added, the Outline (Draft) is the first
medium- and long-range plan in our endeavor to develop a socialist
market economy.
</P>
<P>
China should stress the basic role of the market in allocating
resources under the state's macro-control and emphasize the
macro-economic, strategic and policy characteristics of the state
plan.
</P>
<P>
In general, the planned targets should be prospective
guidelines, with emphasis on the direction and the tasks of
economic and social development, on the corresponding development
strategies and measures, on the aggregate targets for economic and
social development and structural changes, and on a number of
major projects that are of overall importance. The rest of the
targets and projects will be incorporated into future annual
plans.
</P>
<P>
The Outline (Draft) focuses on the Ninth Five-Year Plan and
gives only a broad outline for the following 10 years so as to
link it with our development in the early 21st century and
maintain the continuity of the three-step development strategy, Li
Peng said.

<HEADLINE> Four Points to be Accorded Attention: Li Peng (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- China should accord special
attention to four points in formulating the Outline (Draft) in
accordance with the guiding principles put forward by the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in its Proposal,
said Li Peng, premier of the State Council today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the Fourth Session of the
Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), Li said the four points
are: correctly handling the relationships between reform,
development and stability; vigorously promoting the fundamental
shift in the economic system and the mode of economic growth;
conscientiously resolving major issues bearing on the overall
situation of the reform and development and the plan reflecting
the requirements of a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
In his speech titled "Report on the Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996--2000) on National Economy and Social Development and
Long-Term Target for the Year 2010", Li said, it is vital that the
relationships between reform, development and stability be handled
properly, as the national situation will undergo changes and we
will be faced with new tasks in the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
"Development requires emphasizing improvement in quality and
performance as well as optimizing structure; reform requires
breakthroughs in the solution of key and difficult problems," the
Chinese premier said, adding that all this will give rise to
change in the make-up of various interests and social
relationships, and China must therefore pay close attention to the
maintenance of political and social stability.
</P>
<P>
"We should handle well the overall relationships between
reform, development and stability, and ensure that they are
coordinated with and promote each other," he said.
</P>
<P>
The key to the fulfilment of the objectives in our endeavors
for the next 15 years lies in the shift from a planned economy to
a socialist market economy and from extensive mode to intensive
mode in economic growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the country to follow the general laws of market
economy in shifting the economic system, while adhering to the
socialist orientation.
</P>
<P>
In shifting the mode of economic growth, Li Peng said China
should improve the overall quality and the efficient allocation of
the key elements of production, and lay emphasis on good economic
returns through optimized structure, economy of scale and
scientific and technological advancement.

<HEADLINE> China's Development Goals In Next 15 Years: Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- China is to attain the second-
phase goals of its strategic modernization plan in the next five
years and the third-phase goals in the following ten years,
Chinese Premier Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Fourth Session of the Eighth National People's
Congress (NPC), which opened here today, Li Peng said that China
aims to quadruple its 1980 per capita GDP by the year 2000, when
its population will have been 300 million greater than that in
1980, raise people's living standard to that of a fairly
comfortable life with poverty practically eradicated, expedite the
formulation of a modern enterprise system and establish
preliminarily a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Li told NPC deputies that China aims at doubling its year 2000
GDP by 2010. "By then, the Chinese people will enjoy an even more
comfortable life while a more or less ideal socialist market
economy will have come into being," he said.
</P>
<P>
While carrying out reforms and stepping up development, the
premier said, China must achieve marked results in promoting
socialist culture and ideology, and in strengthening socialist
democracy and the legal system so as to attain all-round social
progress.
</P>
<P>
This goal is worked out by the State Council on the basis of
relevant proposals put forward by the Central Committee of the
Communist Party as well as views and opinions from all social
circles.
</P>
<P>
With the fulfillment of these objectives, Li said, China's
productive forces, comprehensive national strength and people's
living standard will be much higher, and its social and economic
outlook will have undergone tremendous historic changes, which
will lay a solid foundation for the realization of modernization
by the middle of the next century.
</P>
<P>
The premier said,"These objectives are grand but will
definitely be achieved through our hard work."
</P>
<P>
To achieve the above-mentioned objectives, Li told the
deputies, China must consistently follow Deng Xiaoping's theory of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the basic
policy line of the Party, adhere to the principle of "seizing the
current opportunity to deepen the reform and open China wider to
the outside world, promoting development and maintaining
stability," and conscientiously carry out the nine major
principles guiding the national economy and social development as
stated in a recent Party Central Committee proposal.
</P>
<P>
The nine major principles are as follows: maintain a sustained,
rapid and sound development of the national economy; energetically
promote a shift in the mode of economic growth by making higher
economic returns the focus of our economic work; implement the
strategy of revitalizing the nation by relying on science and
education and help forge close ties between science, technology,
education and economy; give top priority to agriculture in
national economic development; focus on the reform of state-owned
enterprises as being central to economic restructuring;
unswervingly open up to the outside world; integrate market
mechanism with macro economic controls and give proper
guidance, protection and full play to the initiative of all
social circles; stick to a coordinated economic
development among different areas and gradually narrow the gaps
between them; maintain synchronized progress in material
civilization and socialist culture and ideology, and coordinated
economic and social development.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A five-member famous
Brazilian rock group "Mamonas Assassinas" and another 4 people
died when the jet in which they were traveling crashed close to
the city of Sao Paulo last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred last Saturday at 23:37 hours local time
and was due to a wrong turn by the pilot of the jet, local press
quoted Civil Aviation Department sources as reporting today.
</P>
<P>
When the plane was 10 km from the Cumbica airport in Guarulhos,
close to Sau Paulo, the control tower gave landing instructions to
the pilot of the jet owned by the Brazilian Madri Air Taxi company.
</P>
<P>
Instead of veering to the right, the pilot turned left and
therefore the aircraft crashed into the Cantareira mountain.
</P>
<P>
There were no survivors of the air crash, Civil
Aviation Department sources said.

<HEADLINE> Premier on Advantages &AMP; Disadvantages for China's Future Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- A simultaneous existence of
opportunities and challenges is what China faces when the country
with a population of 1.2 billion tries to achieve its
modernization goal, Chinese Premier Li Peng said here today.
</P>
<P>
In his report on an Outline of the Ninth Five-Year Plan for
National Economy and Social Development and Long-Term Goals for
the Year of 2010 submitted for examination to the Fourth Session
of the Eighth National People's Congress, Li Peng said the next
fifteen years are an important period that links China's past with
its future.
</P>
<P>
The premier said, "A comprehensive evaluation of the domestic
and international situations at the turn of the century shows that
we are presented with serious challenges as well as rare
historical opportunities."
</P>
<P>
He said, China has laid a relatively solid material and
technological foundation through years of socialist construction,
especially since the implementation of the policy of reform and
opening to the outside world. The vast domestic market and the
relatively large savings deposits are a tremendous promise for
development. In-depth reform and opening up will further
invigorate economic development. Social stability and national
unity provide the basic guarantee for the modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
More important, the premier said, the theory, line and policy
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, which have
evolved through practice, clearly indicate the direction for
continued progress.
</P>
<P>
Viewed from a global perspective, Li said, the peaceful
international environment and China's good peripheral
relations can be expected to continue and therefore China can persist
in its efforts towards economic development. And scientific
and technological advances in the world and the industrial
restructuring and rapid economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region
provide favorable conditions for economic development in China.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, there are quite a few factors
that impede progress in China's medium- and long-term development.
Key factors are: heavy burdens with respect to population and
employment, relative deficiency in per capita resources, the
overall poor quality of the national economy, pressures in
matching the economic, scientific and technological superiority of
developed countries in increasingly stiff international
competition and pressures exerted by hegemonism and power politics
in international relations.
</P>
<P>
The premier said, "We must be vigilant in peace time, work with
a pioneering spirit and make greater strides on the road to
modernization."

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Stade de France, which is under
construction and due to be France's showpiece stadium for the 1998
World Cup Finals, was reportedly on Monday facing a lack of fund.
</P>
<P>
The stadium, which was situated in the Parisian suburb of
Saint-Denis, originally costed at 2.7 billion francs (around 500
million U.S. dollars), would cost an extra 200 million francs
(around 40 million dollars), said Gaetan Desruelles, managing
director of the construction consortium building the stadium.
</P>
<P>
Desruelles said that he was having trouble raising money from
the French banks as they had been plagued with their loans to
EuroTunnel.
</P>
<P>
He said he would had to ask foreign banks to finance the
project.
</P>
<P>
Sports Minister Guy Drut, 1976 Montreal Olympic 110 meters
hurdles champion, admitted that the taxpayers would have to pay
for the extra cost.
</P>
<P>
He added that unless a football club came forward to take over
the ground after the World Cup, the government would pay the
operators of the ground 70 million francs a year (around 14 U.S.
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, French league leaders Paris Saint Germain recently
have signed a contract with the owners of Parc Des Princes keeping
them until 2000.

<HEADLINE> China Achieves Economic Growth Goal 5 Years Ahead of Time (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Li said China opened up further to the outside world in both
scope and scale during the Eighth Five-Year Plan period, which
resulted in the evolution of a pattern of overall opening up,
encompassing both the coastal and inland areas and ranging from
ordinary processing industries to basic industries and
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Total imports and exports exceeded 1,000 billion US dollars,
double that in the Seventh Five-Year Plan period, the premier
said. The investment structure improved; over 160 billion US
dollars worth of foreign capital was used, of which direct foreign
investment accounted for 70 per cent. Advanced technology and
managerial expertise introduced from abroad helped improve China's
manufacturing technology and management. International tourism
grew rapidly. By the end of 1995, China's foreign exchange
reserves totaled more than 73 billion US dollars, which enhanced
the country's capability to make international payments.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1995, the premier said, urban and rural residents
in China were getting nearer to the goal of being comfortably off.
</P>
<P>
The average per capita income used by city dwellers for living
expenses increased by 7.7 percent per year after allowing for
price rises, and the average per capita net income for people in
the countryside went up by 4.5 percent per year. The annual
average rise in total retail sales of consumer goods was 10.6 per
cent. Savings deposits of residents approached 3,000 billion yuan
at the end of 1995, an increase of over 2,000 billion yuan from
the end of the Seventh Five-Year Plan. Urban and rural employment
kept rising.
</P>
<P>
Li said much was achieved in the fight to shake off poverty,
and the population living in deprivation dropped from 85 million
at the end of the Seventh Five-Year Plan to 65 million currently.
New housing for urban and rural inhabitants with a total of 4.3
billion square meters of floor space was completed, increasing the
per capita living space. The system of five work days per week was
introduced in cities and townships.
</P>
<P>
Scientific, technological and educational undertakings
continued to forge ahead, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, 160,000 scientific and technological
results officially recognized by the ministries and commissions
were achieved and the translation of these results into productive
forces accelerated. Significant progress was recorded in making
nine-year compulsory education universal. Rapid advances were
recorded in secondary vocational education and great strides were
made in the reform of the higher education system. Success in
family planning resulted in a drop in population growth from 14.39
per thousand in 1990 to 10.55 per thousand in 1995, marking an
initial success in containing excessive population growth. New

<HEADLINE> China Achieves Economic Growth Goal 5 Years Ahead of Time (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng announced
that China'GDP in 1995 reached 5.76 trillion yuan to attain the
goal of quadrupling its 1980 GDP by the year 2000 five years ahead
of schedule.
</P>
<P>
Li made the announcement in his report on China's development
plans delivered at the Fourth Session of the Eighth National
People's Congress, which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995), the
premier said, the rural economy developed in an all-round way with
agricultural output increasing at an average annual rate of 4.1
percent and township and village enterprises maintaining a good
growth momentum.
</P>
<P>
Industrial output increased by 17.8 percent per annum on
average and the readjustment of the product mix was accelerated as
reflected in a considerable increase in the output of coal,
electricity, iron and steel, motor vehicles, chemical fibers,
chemical fertilizer, household electrical appliances, and in the
ample supply and increased variety of light industrial and textile
products, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Tremendous advances were made in key construction projects and
more than 840 large and medium-sized capital construction projects
were completed, adding to capabilities in transport,
communications and energy sectors. Over 11,000 kilometers of
railway tracks were laid and the Beijing-Kowloon Railway running
through north and south China was completed two years ahead of
schedule. The construction of high class highways, ports and
airports went full steam ahead. A total of more than 70 million
kilowatts of power-generating capacity was added. A rapid headway
was made in post and telecommunications with an addition of 58
million telephone lines. New progress was made in geological
prospecting. Successes in developing basic industries and
infrastructure eased "bottleneck" constraints on economic growth,
providing additional strength for future economic development, the
premier said.
</P>
<P>
Breakthroughs were achieved in economic restructuring during
the five years. The pace of reform was quickened in line with the
objective of building a socialist market economy. A new financial
system centering on a revenue-sharing system and a new tax system
with value-added tax as its main component were basically
established and began smooth operation. Non-commercial and
commercial finance were separated preliminarily, and the official
rate of exchange for the RMB was made uniform with the market
rate, Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the framework of a new macro-control system
took shape and marked results were achieved in stepping up and
improving macro-controls. Price control was further relaxed with
the market playing a much greater role in resource distribution.
New advances were made in the reform of state-owned enterprises,
rural areas, the systems of planning, investment, circulation,
social security, and housing, and in reform of the government
structure.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Reports Faster Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region has
scored rapid economic growth over the past few years as a result
of faster infrastructural construction and all-round agricultural
development, according to the regional government.
</P>
<P>
Tibet's gross domestic product (GDP), the value of goods and
services produced, has risen at an annual rate of 7.5 percent over
the past five years, said an official of the Regional Statistics
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The official added that the region's GDP totaled 5.25 billion
yuan last year, up 10.6 percent from 1994 and 44 percent from 1990.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991 the regional government has spent 10 billion yuan
building transportation, energy and telecommunications facilities,
96 percent more than the amount spent during the 1986-1990 period,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
Tibet is also trying to make use of its abundant energy
resources, including terrestrial heat and hydropower, wind power
and solar energy. To date, it has built more than 100 power
stations with a total generating capacity of 170,000 kw.
</P>
<P>
The Yangbajing Geothermal Power Station, the largest of its
kind in China, now provides 40 percent of the electricity supply
to this regional capital.
</P>
<P>
Tibet has also speeded up road building. Over the past five
years 440 km of roads have been built and another 370 km
upgraded. The region's transport system carried 10.1 million
people and 7.7 million tons of goods during the 1991-1995 period,
71 and 83 percent more than in the 1986-1990 period, respectively.
</P>
<P>
All telephones in Tibet are now program-controlled, and direct
domestic dialing is available in most counties.
</P>
<P>
Tibet has completed the laying of an optic fiber cable linking
Lhasa with Xigaze and Shannan, two other major cities in the
region.
</P>
<P>
A state-funded agricultural development project with a total
investment of one billion yuan was launched at the end of 1990. It
is designed to boost Tibet's economy by developing the valleys of
the Lhasa, the Nyangqu and the Yarlung Zangbo rivers.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years the regional government has spent 490
million yuan undertaking 119 projects in these valleys. As a
result, the valleys reported a combined grain production of
390,000 tons last year, more than half of the region's total grain
output.
</P>
<P>
It was announced early last year that the central government and
other parts of China would finance 62 projects in Tibet. The
total investment has come to 3.3 billion yuan now. To date, 42
projects have already been completed.
</P>
<P>
The projects, together with the 43 projects finished in the
1986-1990 period, have boosted the development of such sectors as
science and technology, culture, education and public health.

<HEADLINE> US Companies Improve Image to Attract Talent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 4 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of U.S.
companies are polishing their image as "employers of choice" in
an attempt to attract talent in a tight labor market.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released today by the Conference Board, a
major private economic research group, the concept of "employers of
choice" emphasizes special opportunities for career development,
attractive compensation plans, a positive reputation in the
community, a distinct corporate culture, and profitability.
</P>
<P>
It is aimed at attracting high-quality employees for companies
under the pressure of fierce competition in the labor market,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Almost three-fourths of the 102 companies surveyed in the
report have taken measures to develop or enhance their status as
employers of choice. Among the companies that have not yet taken
such measures, almost half say they are considering new
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
"Although it is still rare for top executives to explicitly
designate their companies as employers of choice, their guiding
principles imply that high-caliber employees are central to an
organization's success," said Helen Axel, senior research fellow
at the Conference Board and author of the report.
</P>
<P>
The survey covers some of the world's most competitive
companies, which are regularly invited to exchange information and
ideas with their peers and companies in other industries and other
countries.
</P>
<P>
The report said that 43 percent of the members surveyed said
they have encountered difficulties in attracting and retaining
high-quality employees. "The competition for new talent at the top
is fierce," said Axel.
</P>
<P>
Service companies appear to be more seriously affected by these
problems than manufacturers. Half of all service firms, compared
with 38 percent of manufacturers, said they have trouble hiring
top talent.

<HEADLINE> NZ Teachers to Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- About 200,000 secondary school
students in some 300 New Zealand schools will have an extra
holiday tomorrow as their 13,000 teachers will go on strike.
</P>
<P>
The decision to take the industrial action was made by the
teachers' union following yesterday's talks between the union and
Education Minister Wyatt Creech which failed to solve the
differences between the teachers and the Government.
</P>
<P>
The teachers are demanding a pay rise of 21 percent and
government actions to deal with shortage of teachers and their
workloads.
</P>
<P>
But the State Services Commission of the Government has agreed
to a two percent pay rise, plus one percent rise linked to
teachers' performance.
</P>
<P>
It also wants to replace the present collective contracts with
the teachers with site contracts, delegating negotiations to
school levels instead of through the union.

<HEADLINE> IOC Refuses American Swimmer's Request for Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee (IOC) on Monday rejected American swimmer Rick DeMont's
appeal for restitution of his 1972 gold medal which was stripped
following a positive drug test.
</P>
<P>
DeMont, who tested positive to a banned substance after
winning the 400 meters freestyle gold medal at the Munich
Olympics in 1972, based his appeal on the fact that he had taken
Marax medication which included the substance for his asthma.
</P>
<P>
DeMont held that he followed rules and had notified officials
before the race that he was taking the asthma drugs.
</P>
<P>
The executive board of Lausanne-based IOC had turned down
DeMont's first petition in December. DeMont filed a new request
last week, citing the recent case of an Australian swimmer who
only received a "stern warning" for using a banned painkiller.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing in the documents that DeMont had submitted gave it
reason to reverse the original decision," the IOC said in its
Monday's statement.
</P>
<P>
Australian world champion Samantha Riley tested positive for a
banned substance contained in a headache tablet given to her by
her coach Scott Volkers, who received a two-year international
ban.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, the 11 cities bidding for the 2004 Summer
Olympics drew lots to determine the order in which they will make
presentations to the IOC next year.
</P>
<P>
The order is: Stockholm, Sweden; San Juan, Puerto Rico; Cape
Town, South Africa; Istanbul, Turkey; Athens, Greece; Buenos
Aires, Argentina; St. Petersburg, Russia; Rome, Italy; Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil; Lille, France; and Seville, Spain.
</P>
<P>
The candidates cities will make their presentations to a
special IOC selection panel in March or April 1997.

WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice-President Al Gore
today called on the TV industry to create better programs for
children.
</P>
<P>
"We want there to be more and better programming for children,"
Gore told a White House meeting with children's television
advocates.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton has urged TV stations to air at least
three hours of educational shows for children a week.
</P>
<P>
Gore was joined by his wife, Tipper, and Hillary Rodham
Clinton. They all hailed the TV industry's promise last Thursday
to begin rating TV programs by January 1997, and said that more
must be done.
</P>
<P>
"When parents, the entertainment industry and our political
leaders work together and act responsibly we can all make sure
that television becomes the enriching experience for children that
it should be," Hillary Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
They talked to representatives of nearly 80 organizations
including media watchdog, education, medical, child and family and
religious groups.
</P>
<P>
TV rating and improvement of programming were discussed at a

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said today that the United States will do everything it can to
support the peace process in the Middle East despite a series of
bombings in recent days that killed about 50 Israelis.
</P>
<P>
"The enemies of the peace have murdered completely innocent
Israeli citizens, including children, in their hysterical,
determined, fanatic attempt to kill all hope of peace between
Israel and Palestinians and others in the Middle East," Clinton
told a news conference during a visit to Taylor, Michigan.
</P>
<P>
A suicide bomber blew himself up today outside Tel Aviv's
biggest shopping center, the fourth fatal terror attack in Israel
in nine days which came one day after a suicide bomber blew up a
bus in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel announced after the bombing Sunday that it would
indefinitely suspend peace talks with Syria at the Wye Plantation
Conference Center on Maryland's Eastern Shore.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "We must again state our determination that these
forces of terror shall not triumph."
</P>
<P>
"Together with those who have worked so hard for lasting peace
in the Middle East, the United States is committed to confronting
this challenge and to prevailing over these forces of hate and
violence," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton urged Palestine President Yasser Arafat to get tougher
with the radical Arabs who have claimed responsibility for the
bombings.
</P>
<P>
"I believe Arafat will have to do more," Clinton said. "He will
have to do everything he can up to the limits of whatever
capacities they have, and rest of us will have to do our part as
well."
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Warren Christopher cut off a Caribbean trip
to lead an emergency White House meeting this afternoon to discuss
what the United States should do in light of these attacks.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said that the United States may increase its
intelligence operation in the Middle East to help Israel combat
terrorist attacks.

<HEADLINE> Perry: U.S. to Maintain Offensive Nuclear Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States is committed
to maintaining a small, highly effective offensive nuclear force
as a hedge against future ballistic missile attack, Defense
Secretary William Perry said today.
</P>
<P>
Perry made the remarks while releasing details of President
Bill Clinton's Fiscal Year (FY) 1997 defense budget at a Pentagon
press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. nuclear weapons strategy will be
complemented by robust efforts to develop defense against
ballistic missile attack.
</P>
<P>
The new U.S. defense budget includes 2.8 billion U.S. dollars
in FY 1997 for Theater Missile Defense, National Missile Defense
and Support Technology, he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the emphasis of the National Missile
Defense (NMD) program will be shifted from a technology readiness
to a development readiness program.
</P>
<P>
The development of the program will comply with the
Anti-Ballistic Treaty signed between the United States and the
Soviet Union in 1972 and enable the U.S. to develop within three
years the elements of an initial NMD system that could be deployed
within three years of a deployment decision, the Pentagon chief
said.
</P>
<P>
Perry said the defense funding requested form FY 1997 through
FY 2001 places highest priority on Theater Missile Defense (TMD).
TMD supports the development, procurement, and development of
system to protect forward-deployed U.S. troops and U.S. allies
against theater ballistic missiles, he added.

<HEADLINE> Perry Presents U.S. Fiscal 1997 Defense Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States will continue
to give top priority to sustaining the readiness of its military
forces, Defense Secretary William Perry said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference releasing the U.S. defense
budget in fiscal year 1997, Perry said that the Pentagon will try
to strike a prudent balance between immediate military needs and
long-term investments.
</P>
<P>
The long-term investments include the military forces' basic
scientific research and the modernization of weapons and
equipment, Perry added.
</P>
<P>
The fiscal year 1997 defense request seeks discretionary
spending of 243.4 billion U.S. dollars in budget authority and
248.2 billion dollars for the Department of Defense, Perry told
reporter. Compared to the level the Congress approved for fiscal
year 1996, the fiscal year 1997 defense budget is about 6 percent
lower in real terms, he said.
</P>
<P>
Perry disclosed that the United States is embarking upon the
recapitalization of U.S. military forces, mainly the modernization
of weapons and equipment to ensure they remain qualitatively
superior to those of likely future adversaries.
</P>
<P>
By fiscal year 2001, funding to procure equipment to modernize
the U.S. military forces will increase to 60.1 billion dollars,
representing a 40 percent increase in real terms over the 38.9
billion dollars requested for fiscal year 1997, Perry said.

<HEADLINE> US Confirms Israel-Syria Peace Talks Suspension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department
confirmed here today that Israel had indefinitely suspended peace
talks with Syria at the Wye Plantation Conference Center on
Maryland's Eastern Shore.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Glyn Davies told reporters at a news briefing, "The
Israeli delegation to the Wye River talks is going to head back to
Israel very soon to participate in the officially declared period
of mourning there."
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any word to give you at this stage about when
the Wye talks proceed," he said, "we'll have to see how things
develop."
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres made the decision of
suspending peace talks with Syria at the Wye Plantation, where
negotiations resumed last Wednesday, in the wake of a bombing in
Jerusalem Sunday which killed 19 people.
</P>
<P>
And a new bombing, the fourth fatal terror attack in Israel in
nine days, today killed 12 people and wounding more than 100 in
Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Davies condemned today's bombing as "an outrageous and cowardly
act," saying, "This act only strengthens the resolve of the United
States to do everything possible with the nations of the region to
ensure that terrorists do not succeed."
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. is now engaging in a high-level review to find ways
to intensify our efforts to combat terror," he added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton will hold an emergency White House
meeting this afternoon to discuss what the Untied States should

<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The number of tourists visiting
Tunisia in 1995 increased by 7 percent over the previous year,
while the country's tourism revenues rose by 1 percent, it was
announced by a Tunisian tourism official here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference, the Tunisian Minister of Tourism
and Handicraft Industry, Salah el-Din Ma'awy, said these
achievements were satisfactory, reflecting the natural development
of the tourism industry in Tunisia and demonstrating that the flow
of tourists was of among the highest in the region.
</P>
<P>
He added that Tunisia's tourism strategy for 1996 focuses on
three channels. The first is based on the organization of
successive professional trips for 7,000 tourist agents who will be
instrumental in activating the flow of tourists into Tunisia and
in putting Tunisia in the touristic packages of at least 100 major
travel agencies.
</P>
<P>
The second channel is to promote the visit-Tunisia plan within
the German market, including the organization of 1,500
professional trips for German travel agencies.
</P>
<P>
The third channel is related to propaganda campaigns directed
to east European markets. Similar activities will be oriented to
such markets as the Arab states, Japan and other countries.
</P>
<P>
Tunisia has also signed contracts with a number foreign
establishments to build tourism utilities and attractions in
Tunisian touristic sites such as Jerba and Qayrouan. Likewise,
several foreign travel agencies have intended to invest in Tunisia
by building more hotels.

<HEADLINE> Labor Urges Inquiry Into Leeson's Secret Accounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- An immediate investigation into
claims that Nick Leeson, the man responsible for the collapse of
Barings Bank, has six secret accounts in German banks was called
for Sunday by Alistair Darling, Labor's City spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative that the bank authorities and
the surviving Barings Bank find out how the money got there
because there are still many people who are due money after the
collapse of Barings," Darling said.
</P>
<P>
"If Nick Leeson is keen to cooperate with the authorities, as
he says he is, he should tell them where this money came from," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of England said Sunday it was "surprised" by the
claims.
</P>
<P>
A report in The Sunday Times said that investigators, who
appear to be acting independently, had tracked down six bank
accounts with 23 million pounds (35 million U.S. dollars), two in
Leeson's name and four controlled by Indonesian holding companies.
</P>
<P>
Leeson is believed to be a signatory to all six. The report
claimed that the accounts were opened in April 1994, 10 months
before Barings collapsed.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Bank of England said, "The officials in
Singapore and the Bank of England report could not find any
evidence that money had been salted away. All the money that went
missing has been accounted for by trades in the market."
</P>
<P>
Local press reports today said Leeson is to be quizzed by
Singapore inspectors in his Changi prison cell this week, and the
allegation that Leeson did hide money away will also be examined
by members of the Commons Treasury Select Committee.

</P>
<P>
He noted that the second stage of quartering would be affected
if no improvement is made about the camps.

<P>
On inspection, Beye promised that U.N. organs and
non-governmental organizations in Angola will try their best to
help solve the problems UNITA fighters there are facing.
</P>
<P>
As the first step, he pledged to provide an ambulance to
withdraw the ill soldiers from the camp.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Executive Council of the
Lebanese Federation of Trade Unions adopted today a proposal
calling for a two-day general strike by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
At an extraordinary meeting today, the Executive Council also
demanded the Lebanese government to nullify its decree banning
demonstrations and entrusting the Army with the maintenance of
security.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Executive Council expressed its readiness
to continue dialogue with the government, pointing out that such
dialogue hinges on the government's response to the federation's
demands for increasing wages and improving social conditions.
</P>
<P>
The federation had earlier decided to stage a general strike
and demonstrations on February 29, demanding to increase wages for
workers, improve social conditions and freeze media law.
</P>
<P>
In response, the government authorized the Army to maintain
security and the Army headquarters promptly imposed curfew across
the country starting 3 a.m. on February 29 until 2 p.m. the same
day.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue between the trade unions federation and the
government has been on and off over one month, the federation
believes that the government has been insisting on its previously
unannounced decisions, which has led the dialogue to a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Thus the federation called again for a general strike and
demonstrations.

Liberia and set up bases in all provincial cities.
