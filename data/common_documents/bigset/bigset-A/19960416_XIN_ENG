<HEADLINE> UK government Concerned Over Lebanese Casualties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The British government today
expressed concern over the worsening crisis between Israel and
Hizbollah guerillas in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The British Foreign Office said in a statement the British
government is "disturbed by the increasing effects on civilians
and by the growing humanitarian problems as large number of people
flee from the South".
</P>
<P>
The statement also said that "there can be no justification for
the continued Hizbollah attacks on northern Israel which
precipitated the crisis."
</P>
<P>
"We encourage all the parties to do what they can to break the
cycle of violence and return to a situation permitting a
resumption of negotiations on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks of
peace process," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the British government has decided to send Director
for Middle East Affairs of the Foreign Office John Shepherd to
Beirut for talks with the Lebanese government on the issue.
</P>
<P>
British Defense Secretary Michael Portillo, who is visiting
Israel, was reported by the BBC television as backing the Israeli
government, saying "it is the right of every country to defend
itself."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Israel has launched fresh attacks on
southern Lebanon in response to Hizbollah missile attacks on
northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Lebanese have fled their homes in
southern Lebanon since Israel staged reprisal attacks earlier last
week.

<HEADLINE> Soft Drink Prices Up in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Soft Drinks Manufacturers
Association of Zimbabwe today announced a six percent price
increase, the second in less than eight months.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the association Steve Kuipa said the industry has
adjusted prices due to escalating input and manufacturing costs
which threaten to erode the industry's viability.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the industry, which last year suffered a six
percent decline in volume sales up to the year ended March 1996,
has been affected by high operational costs since the last price
increase.
</P>
<P>
However, Kuipa said despite the price rise, soft drinks made
and sold in Zimbabwe are still among the cheapest in the region.

<P>
NANJING, Jiangsu Province, April 15 (Xinhua) -- China came from
behind to outplay Japan 9-15, 15-9, 15-13, 15-10 in the second leg
of the four-nation women's volleyball tournament here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese, winner of the first leg with an unbeaten record in
Guangzhou last week, trailed the Japanese 9-15 quickly in the
first set.
</P>
<P>
Spearheaded by veteran Lai Yawen, the Chinese players combined
their tight net blockings with powerful spikes, leveled the match
score by winning the second set 15-9.
</P>
<P>
After the score was tied at 13-13 in the third set, the Chinese
pulled away to take the set 15-13 and then the fourth set 15-10.
</P>
<P>
In the other match earlier, world champion Cuba fought back
from two sets down to beat the Netherlands 15-17, 11-15, 15-3,
15-8, 15-10.
</P>
<P>
The Cubans, led by super star Mireya Luis, were apparently not
in good form, trailing the Dutch squad 4-12 soon after the start
of the game.
</P>
<P>
But they managed to level the score for three times at 12-12,
13-13 and 15-15 before dropping it 15-17.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands maintained their momentum to take the second
set 15-11.
</P>
<P>
Luis was then replaced by teammate Gto Idalmis, who helped turn
the tide and snatched the following three sets.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Hezbollah Calls for "Real Guarantee" for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, today stressed the need to
find a "real guarantee" for the security of civilians instead of
the so-called "July understanding."
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Naim Al-Kassem, deputy secretary general of the Shiite
fundamentalist Hezbollah, pointed out here that his party believed
that the "July understanding" in its original form was not
efficient any more due to the recent offensive launched by Israel
in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Under the July understanding, a tacit agreement mediated by the
United States to put an end to an Israeli blitz in south Lebanon
in July, 1993, Israel should refrain from attacking civilian
targets in south Lebanon in exchange for Hezbollah's promise not
to attack Jewish settlements in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
"Now there should be a real guarantee not allowing what has
taken place to repeat, and not allowing an existence of the
migrants dispelled by the (Israeli) aggressions from their
homelands," the Hezbollah senior official underlined in an
interview with the Beirut "Sawt Ash-Shaab" (Voice of the People)
Radio.
</P>
<P>
"It can not be satisfied (to apologize) for a mistake here or a
mistake there, or a wrong aggression which could pass without a
price or punishment, or without a position able to put an end to
the criminal operations against Lebanon's people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Local observers note an apparent shift in Kassem's remarks,
comparing with previous statements announced by other Hezbollah
leaders in which they stressed Hezbollah's commitment to the July
understanding.
</P>
<P>
And the observers say, judging from Kassem's remarks, Hezbollah
might possibly be willing to accept a mediation which could lead
to an Israeli ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he had a specific idea on the "real guarantee,"
Kassem said that consultations were under way among the parties
concerned.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question whether Hezbollah had a plan to enlarge
its response to the enlarging Israeli aggressions in Lebanon, the
Hezbollah official stressed that he "can not announce, through the
press, the details of the plan which should be expressed in the
battlefield."
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that Hezbollah would "respond by firing
Katyusha rockets into northern Israel more intensively and we
will enlarge our strikes at the Jewish settlements in northern
Israel."

<HEADLINE> China Calls on Lifting Closure of Gaza, West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador Qin
Huasun today called on Israeli government to lift closure of the
Palestinian territories so as to promote the peace process in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the public debate on Palestine at the U.N. Security
Council, Qin urged the parties concerned to respect and protect
the rights and interest of the Palestinian people, ensure a smooth
progress of the self-governing process and help restore the normal
economic life of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Since the Israeli government sealed off the West Bank and Gaza
in early March, the normal life of Palestinian people has been
affected severely and the Palestinian economy has met great
difficulties, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he expressed sympathy for the victims of the
large-scale terrorist bombs in Israel.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China is opposed to all kinds of terrorism,
which threatens life and security of the people in the countries
concerned and threatens international peace and security.
Terrorists must be punished by law.
</P>
<P>
However, anti-terrorism operations should, like handling other
international issues, follow the norms governing the international
relations and the international law and not violate the
sovereignty, security and basic interest of another country, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the sovereignty and security of all countries in the
Middle East should be respected and ensured on the one hand, and
terrorism should not be linked with Arab countries and people, nor
should the innocent people be punished indiscriminately on the
excuse of anti-terrorism, he added
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation called on all parties concerned to make
joint efforts to realize comprehensive peace in the Middle East,
promote regional economic cooperation and uproot the source of
terrorism.

In a related development, the Israeli bombardments at the
southern Lebanese market town of Nabatiyeh and its vicinities were
still sporadicly continuing today.
</P>
<P>
Police sources in the south said one resident in the town was
wounded in the morning bombardments.
</P>
<P>
The police sources said that more than 300 heavy artillery
shells have fallen at various districts of the town since this
morning, causing serious material damages.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli forces today expanded a "death zone" in south
Lebanon, and ordered a departure of all residents in towns and
villages in the areas of Iglim Al-Toffah, Nabatiyeh and south of
Litani River, including Nabatiyeh town and the port city of Sour.
</P>
<P>
All the residents in these areas should leave their houses
before 8:00 a.m. local time (05:00 GMT) or "they will face
dangers," the Isreali army said in an ultimatum, announcing that
this was for intensifying the combat against Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
With the advent of the time limit, the Israeli occupation
forces in the South immediately resumed the bombardments at these
areas.
</P>
<P>
Since the Israeli forces issued the first ultimatum Friday
ordering residents of 41 southern Lebanese towns and villages to
leave their houses, which was followed by a similar order for
residents of 39 more towns and villages, some 400,000 Lebanese
civilians have been forced to escape from their homelands.
</P>
<P>
Israeli jet fighters carried out frequent reconnaissance over
Beirut and its southern suburbs since 1:00 p.m. local time (10:00
GMT) today and broke sound barrier, drawing anti-air fire opened
by Lebanese army units and Syrian troops around the capital with
machine-guns and artilleries.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes also carried out air raids at south Lebanese
towns and villages, destroying some civilian houses and causing
flames to some others.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an airport official reported that some airplanes
carrying relief materials have arrived at Beirut International
Airport since this morning.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has made diplomatic efforts in order to rally
international help of those Lebanese who have been dispelled by
the continuous Israeli aggressions since Thursday from their
homelands in south Lebanon.

The missiles hit a dwelling building and a school, and a local

<HEADLINE> Manuel Reiterates Gradual Removal of Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Finance Minister Trevor
Manuel today reiterated that foreign exchange controls in South
Africa would be gradually removed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the South Africa International Development Forum
in Pretoria, Manuel said the timing and sequence of relaxation of
the foreign exchange controls would be worked out by the Reserve
Bank and the Department of Finance.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from more than 130 countries in the world
attended today's conference on international financial aid.
</P>
<P>
"Our stated policy is a gradual removal of the existing
exchange control measures," said the minister, adding the
remaining controlling measures would therefore be steadily removed
in due course.
</P>
<P>
In general and as demonstrated by the recent developments in
the financial markets, Manuel said the opening up of the economy
would entail, at least initially, a certain degree of volatility
stemming from capital flows.
</P>
<P>
However, in his first major speech since taking over as
finance minister early this month, Manuel said the overall
objective is to substantially increase long-term foreign capital
inflows to supplement domestic equity investment in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that both monetary and fiscal policies of the
government would have to be conducted in a coordinated and
credible manner in order to prevent excessive fluctuations of
real exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, South Africa's local currency Rand, which
had been weak for quite a long time, hit its recorded low of
4.1900 against the Dollar in the financial markets.

<HEADLINE> UK Building Industry Sets to Cut 20,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Employers have warned that up to
20,000 jobs could be lost in the building industry in Britain this
year, according to a BBC TV report today.
</P>
<P>
The Building Employers Construction (BEC) made the warning at
the launch of its quarterly construction trends survey.
</P>
<P>
It reported a 0.5 percent fall in construction output in the
first quarter of 1996, with flat growth seen for the year.
</P>
<P>
The BEC said the expected cutback would bring the number of
building jobs lost over the past six years to more than 0.5
million.
</P>
<P>
The construction industry remained in a prolonged state of
recession despite other parts of the economy moving into recovery
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Since the industry sank into recession in 1990, the BEC has
reported annual job losses of 100,000 for the five years to 1995.
</P>
<P>
Its latest report, based on a survey of 600 firms, showed that
margins had continued to decline in the first quarter of 1996 and
that 41 percent of firms surveyed reported less success in
tendering for new work.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Dr. K.Y. Amoako, Executive
Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa
(ECA), said here today that "it is now possible to see a
different Africa, an Africa of renewal."
</P>
<P>
Addressing a three-day consultative meeting on partnership
with ECA, Amoako said, "we are experiencing a new international
economic environment of which Africa is becoming an integral
part," adding, "globally, macroeconomic stabilization is
converging with international economic linkages."
</P>
<P>
"The latest U.N. projections for developing countries shows
gross domestic products growth projected to rise from 2.2 percent
in the past decade to 5.2 percent in the next," he said.
</P>
<P>
Amoako noted that "in the region of sub-Saharan Africa,
expectations for improvement in regional growth over the next
decade to 4 percent per year are conditioned on a number of
assumptions."
</P>
<P>
He described "a number of assumptions" as "a continuation in
the recent pace of reforms, a slower pace of decline in terms of
trade, and a consolidation of civil peace in the sub-regions."
</P>
<P>
Dr. Amoako stated that "Africa requires a renewed ECA," saying
that "we are committed to a major renewal of the organization on
a scale not seen in ECA's history."
</P>
<P>
Referring to ECA's renewal programs, he said the programs
concentrate on five core themes and 2 cross-cutting themes.
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. Amoako, the five themes are facilitating
economic and social policy analysis, ensuring food security and
sustainable development, strengthening development management,
harnessing information for development and promoting regional
cooperation and integration.
</P>
<P>
Two cross-cutting themes are gender, to enhance women's
participation in economic development, and capacity building
within Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of delegates from various countries, U.N. agencies,
international organizations and governmental and non-governmental
organizations attended the meeting.

<HEADLINE> African Oil Trade Conference Opens in Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A three-day African Oil Trade
Conference started here today, with a call for strengthening
management to ensure success of oil trade in the continent.
</P>
<P>
It will focus on how sub-Saharan Africa can promote the role
of African Banks in the oil sector, financing and improving
operations and financing efficiency among oil importers and
traders through techniques in oil marketing, risk management and
finance.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Zimbabwe's Transport and Energy
Minister Simon Moyo pointed out that innovative management was
central to the success of the oil trade in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said many African countries faced oil procurement problems
due to foreign currency shortages.
</P>
<P>
This, he told the delegates, called for aggressiveness in
marketing, risk management and oil financing.
</P>
<P>
Moyo said the fact that oil purchases are denominated in
United States Dollars makes it even more expensive for African
countries to import the product.
</P>
<P>
Sub-Saharan African countries also face transit risks due to
their landlocked position, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The minister said most countries in the region do not have
crude oil reserves, and have no choice but to import.
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, the value of petroleum imports for the
region has been between 10 and 20 percent of the region's total
exports, while for some individual countries, the cost of
petroleum imports has been as high as 70 percent or more of their
total exports.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, the governments have tried to control
the importation and price of oil so as to protect the consumers.
</P>
<P>
President of the Eastern and Southern African Trade and
Development (PTA) Bank Martin Ogang said that sub-Saharan Africa
countries trading in oil lack the skills to effectively manage
their refineries and capital.
</P>
<P>
He said there is need to emphasize on how oil refiners,
importers and end-users could develop and implement practical
solutions to problems faced.
</P>
<P>
He said the PTA Bank is concerned with the challenge of
Africa's capacity to control trade in its own commodities.

<HEADLINE> Urban Population to Exceed That in Countryside by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The human race will become a
predominantly urban species and by 2000 more people will be living
in the world's towns and cities than in the countryside, said a
report being published this week.
</P>
<P>
Details of the report prepared by the U.N. Development Program,
the U.N. Environment Program, the World Bank and the World
Resources Institute, for a U.N. conference on the future of the
world cities, appear in the Independent on Sunday newspaper here.
</P>
<P>
It said that the change of habitat is happening at an
astonishing speed. The world's urban population is growing faster
than the already rapid increase in human numbers as a whole, and
will almost double over the next 30 years.
</P>
<P>
"As recently as 1975, just over one third of the world's people
lived in urban areas," said the report, but "by 2025, the
proportion will have risen to almost two thirds."
</P>
<P>
The report said that in 1900, only New York and London had more
than 8 million people, and now London is not even among the
world's top 25 cities.
</P>
<P>
By 2015, the top five biggest cities are: Tokyo with a
population of 28.7 million; Bombay, 27.4 million; Lagos, 24.4
million; Shanghai, 23.4 million; and Jakarta, 21.2 million.
</P>
<P>
The report is aimed to alert government to a coming urban
crisis. One of the results of the faster population urbanization
is that in developing countries 600 million people are estimated
to live in slums, the report predicted.
</P>
<P>
Twenty years later, London will also shoulder a heavy burden,
described Herbert Giradet, professor of environmental planning at
Middlesex University.
</P>
<P>
By the time, although London covers less than 400,000 acres, it
needs nearly 50 million acres -- 125 times its area -- to provide
it with food, timber and other resources and to absorb its
pollution, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This means that although it contains only 12 percent of
Britain's population, London requires an area equivalent of all
the country's productive land to service it," he said.

WASHINGTON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today began an eight-day round-the-world visit to show his
capability and skills in foreign affairs and promote U.S. security
relations with its allies in northeastern Asia.
</P>
<P>
Leaving Washington late this evening, Clinton will stop briefly
in South Korea before a three-day state visit to Japan, the first
of its kind since former U.S. President George Bush visited the
country in January 1992.
</P>
<P>
Clinton then will fly to Russia for a summit of Russia and
seven leading industrialized nations on international nuclear
safety and security.
</P>
<P>
"The president will confront some of the oldest and newest
challenges to the security of our nation, from the last unresolved
problem of the Cold War...to one of the most urgent new threats we
face -- nuclear smuggling," U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher told reporters today.
</P>
<P>
White House and State Department officials have said security
problems, not trade disputes, are expected to lead Clinton's
agenda on his visit.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said that Clinton has made strong headway on
opening markets for U.S. products in Japan.
</P>
<P>
"It's a good time to emphasize the security and political
aspects of our relationship, to show that all the legs of the
stool are of great importance," he said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Gives Priority to Poverty Eradication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government will give
priority to the eradication of starvation and poverty in the next
five years, an official report said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the head of the government office Le Xuan
Trinh as saying that the government will focus on efforts to help
an estimated 600,000 families out of chronic hunger over the next
three years, and to reduce the number of poor families from the
current 16 percent to 10 percent of the population by 2000.
</P>
<P>
To achieve these goals, the report said, the government has set

production, bank credit, technical and professional training,
volunteer services offering new technology, infrastructure
improvement for underdeveloped areas, and education and health
care for the poor.
</P>
<P>

land law to guarantee land to all poor families and grant their
access to credit for production.
</P>
<P>
The government will also expand the credit system to make loans
available to 90 to 95 percent of poor households by 2000, up from
the current 30 percent.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israel May Consider Diplomatic Efforts to End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 15 (Xinhua) -- As fighting between the
Israeli army and Hezbollah gunmen continues, Prime Minister
Shimon Peres said here today that Israel may consider any
diplomatic initiative to end the conflict in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Peres made the remarks to reporters before a meeting with
visiting British Defense Secretary Michael Portillo, who arrived
here on Saturday for a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
However, Peres said that so far there is no particular
diplomatic initiative that can end the conflict. "We shall judge
the situation by its realities," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Israel wants to ensure a real peace, not a
peace of paper.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli leader denied charges that Israel is responsible
for the large amount of Lebanese refugees that fled the south of
Lebanon, but blamed Hezbollah (Party of God) for having worsened
the situation.
</P>
<P>
"We are forced to react (to Hezbollah Katyusha rocket attacks
at northern Israel)," said the premier. "We did not create the
problem of the Lebanese refugees."
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Lebanon, more than 400,000 Lebanese
have fled over 50 towns and villages in the south of the country
to escape Israeli military operation against Hezbollah targets,
code-named "Operation Grapes of Wrath," which started last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Portillo, meanwhile, offered full support for Israel's
operation in southern Lebanon, saying the action "is responding
to terrorist threat posed by Hezbollah."
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes carried out strikes throughout today against
Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon, as Hezbollah fired more
Katyusha rockets at northern Israeli towns and villages.
</P>
<P>
Eight were injured during the Katyusha attacks, according to
the Israel Radio report, and several cars and buildings were
damaged.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that in the past few days, more than 28
Lebanese civilians have been killed and nearly 100 others wounded
in the Israeli strikes against the Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri
today held talks in Paris with French President Jacques Chirac in
order to ask for French help to defuse the tension in southern
Lebanon. Lebanon was a French colony before its independence.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has called on the Hezbollah to stop
Katyusha rocket attacks on northern Israel to end the cycle of
violence.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette is due to arrive here
tonight to discuss the situation in southern Lebanon with Israeli
leaders, while Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Karim Kabariti is
scheduled to be here on Tuesday also in this effort.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Revise Import-export Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is to revise its
import-export regulations to streamline red-tape procedures and
boost foreign trade, the English daily "Vietnam News" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the revision was contained in a new draft law
of commerce to be submitted to the National Assembly later this
year.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Trade Minister Le Van Triet as saying that
Vietnam is seeking an export turnover of 45 billion U.S. dollars
under the next five-year plan ending year 2000, or an increase of
almost 280 percent over the 16 billion dollars posted during the
last five-year plan.
</P>
<P>
For exports to reach 17-20 billion dollars by 2000, the growth
rate will have to hit almost 30 percent, Triet said.
</P>
<P>
To meet these goals, the trade ministry has put forward several
proposals for restructuring the economy, including industrializing
agriculture, forestry and fisheries to improve production quality
and quantity, the minister said..
</P>
<P>
"Export of commodities such as rice, coffee and cashews will be
encouraged in the form of processed goods rather than raw
materials to add their value," Triet said. "This will require
upgrading, processing and service industries to store, preserve
and package products according to international standards."
</P>
<P>
But the minister said the government intends to maintain its
ban on exports of raw timber, logs, cut wood, and raw and
semi-processed rattan, and will seek to reduce exports of crude
minerals including crude oil and unprocessed natural gas.
</P>
<P>
As a party to the Free Trade Area (AFTA) of the Association of
South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), Vietnam will reduce tariffs on
import items for other AFTA member countries.
</P>
<P>
But Triet said the reductions will have little effect on the
country's budget revenues as 57 percent of the 857 items slated
for reductions are currently subject to low tariffs of zero to
five percent, while only about 17 to 21 percent are subject to
tariffs of 20 percent and above.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Africa Coop Remains China's Basic Policy: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official
stressed here today that strengthening Sino-Africa ties remains
one of China's fundamental policies toward Africa.
</P>
<P>
"China and Africa enjoy traditional friendship," said Yang
Wensheng, Assistant Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation who is now heading a Chinese delegation at the
Partners Meeting of the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa
(ECA).
</P>
<P>
"We have long been sharing feelings with and giving support to
each other," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Yang said China is currently reforming its practice of foreign
assistance which is aimed at expanding its economic and technical
cooperation with African countries and enhancing the economic and
social efficiency of those projects financed by the Chinese
government.
</P>
<P>
"In the future, China's foreign aid will mainly take the form
of government concessional loans. China will also provide certain
grants as the case may demand such assistance," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We provide foreign assistance to help recipient governments
to finance those medium and small-sized production-oriented
projects where there are sufficient supply of local resources and
need for the end products," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Yang pointed out that "over the past decades, China has,
within its capability, provided assistance to African countries,
which we regard as one of our international obligations."
</P>
<P>
"We do not condition our assistance on any political demand,
which has contributed our due share to the development of African
economy," he added.
</P>
<P>
The official said the Chinese government would encourage
enterprises from respective countries to enter into joint-equity
or joint-cooperative arrangements with China for the construction
and management of those projects.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the principles of China's economic and
technical assistance toward Africa, i.e., equality, mutual
benefit, provision of assistance in diversified forms, efficiency
orientation and common development.
</P>
<P>
Yang said in recent years, Sino-Africa economic and trade
cooperation moved "on a fast track".
</P>
<P>
The two-way trade volume hit 3.921 billion U.S. Dollars in
1995, 4.19 times over that of 1990.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, China had completed 566 construction
projects for complete plants out of a total number of 725
projects undertaken by China in African countries.
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, China has provided multi-lateral assistance to 42
African countries and provided training to more than 660
technical and managerial personnel in various areas.
</P>
<P>
On top of that, China has deployed 800 people to Africa
working in 35 medical teams, he added.

<HEADLINE> Former S. Korean President Admits Giving Money to 1987 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Former South Korean President Chun
Doo-hwan said here today that he spent about 256 million
U.S. dollars for supporting campaigners in the presidential
election in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Testifying at the second trial session of the graft case
involving him at the Seoul District Court, Chun said that he also
spent some 520 million U.S. dollars out of "contributions" from
businessmen for political purposes and for supporting people and
organizations in all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
Chun, who was arrested on December 3 last year, was indicted on
January 12 on charges that he raised about 900 million U.S.
dollars of secret fund during his 1980-1988 presidency from 42
major business leaders.
</P>
<P>
"The secret fund I raised was a pure political fund in the
collection of which no coercion was employed at all," Chun said at
today's trial.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution said that Chun had 182.3 million U.S. dollars
in securities at the time he stepped down from presidency in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Chun is the second head of state of South Korea to stand trial
on graft charges. Another former president, Roh Tae-woo, who was
taken into custody on November 16 last year after being arrested,
has stood trial three times already as he also faces charges of
receiving 370 million U.S. dollars in bribes from businessmen
while in office.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the graft charges, both Chun and Roh are also
being tried for insurrection and treason for their leading roles
in the military mutiny on December 12, 1979 and the 1980 Kwangju
incident.
</P>
<P>
Chun took power on August 27, 1980, and ruled the country until
February 1988. He was followed by Roh who stepped down in February
1993.

<HEADLINE> UK Tory MPs Warn Major Against Shift to Right </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Tory members of
parliament on the left-wing have warned Prime Minister John Major
against his his shift to right.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said four Tory left-wingers will switch their
allegiance and at the same time, Britain's opposition Labour
appealed today to wavering Conservative MPs to defect from Major's
government.
</P>
<P>
Tim Rathbone, one of the four Tory left-wingers, warned that he
might quit if the Tories became "absurdly right-wing".
</P>
<P>
Rothbone's colleague Peter Temple-Morris told BBC radio that
the opposition Labour was winning the battle to claim the centre
ground on Britian's arena of politics.
</P>
<P>
Since the defeat in last week's by-election, in which the
government's majority in the parliament was cut to just one, the
conservatives have been further demoralized.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times weekly reported that two Tory MPs on the
left-wing had secret talks with senior figures in Labour shadow
cabinet. The two unnamed Tories were reported to be deeply worried
about Major's shift to right.
</P>
<P>
Since last October, three Tories have quitted from the
Government's whip, one defecting to Labour, another to the Liberal
Democrats and the third sitting as an independent in the House of
Commons.
</P>
<P>
The embattled prime minister has repeatedly vowed to stick to
the term of this parliament until May, 1997, when the next general
election is held.

<HEADLINE> Major Facing Threat from Referendum Party Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
now is facing a threat in the run-up to the general election from
Sir James Goldsmith, leader of the Referendum party.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with BBC radio today, Goldsmith pledged to
launch a 20 million pounds (30 million U.S. dollar) campaign to
field 600 candidates in the next general election scheduled for
May 1997.
</P>
<P>
In a response to the Tory government's decision to make a
manifesto commitment to hold a referendum on a single European
currency, Goldsmith said that his candidates will stand in seats
where the Conservative candidates oppose a referendum
</P>
<P>
He argued that the government's decision was "an act of
appeasement within the cabinet to try and keep it stable".
</P>
<P>
He said that he would unveil his full list of candidates at the
party's conference in October.
</P>
<P>
Tories feared that the Referendum party could take 15 to 20
seats away from them at the general election and put Labour in
power.

</P>
<P>
Extending welcome to Qiao and his party, LeBlanc recalled his
participation in the establishment of Canada-China diplomatic
relations in 1970 under former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau,
adding that he was pleased with the growth of the bilateral
friendly ties.
</P>
<P>
Canada is one of the first Western countries that forged
diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of China, Qiao said. He
expressed satisfaction with the development of the bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the NPC chairman also conveyed greetings to
LeBlanc from Chinese President Jiang Zemin, and expressed the hope

<P>
LeBlanc said that both his predecessors had visited China and
that he wished to go to China soon.

<P>
The governor general spoke highly of China's economic
development in recent years, adding that it is not easy to provide
adequate food and clothing to a population of 1.2 billion.

his country is stepping up efforts in legislation, especially
economic legislation, to better serve its economic development.

<HEADLINE> Qiao: China Favors Dialogues on Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator Qiao Shi
said here today that his country favors dialogues on human rights
on an equal footing and opposes any country exerting pressure on
China.
</P>
<P>
"China would neither impose its own positions on others," the
chairman of the Standing Committee of the Chinese National
People's Congress said during his meeting with Canadian Foreign
Minister Lloyd Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
Qiao and his entourage flew in from Toronto Sunday. He is here

will also visit Regina, Winnipeg and Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting at Axworthy's office in the Canadian parliament
building, Qiao said dialogues on the basis of equality, rather
than confrontations, should be strengthened in handling
nation-to-nation relations.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy said that China has passed some new laws which left a
very deep impression on the Canadians. He expressed the hope that
the two countries could strengthen cooperation between judges and
personnel training.

often and have exchanges in various modalities.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Premier to Visit Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Karim Kabariti is to pay a short visit to Israel Tuesday as part
of Jordan's intensive diplomatic efforts led by King Hussein on
the latest development in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During his brief visit, his first to Israel since he was
appointed as the prime minister last February, Kabariti will
deliver a message from King Hussein to Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres on the situation in Lebanon and the necessity to
stop the bloodshed there.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jordan's Lower House of Parliament denounced here
today Israel's aggression on Lebanon and its military attacks on
civilians.
</P>
<P>
The Lower House also appealed for emergency aid to the
Lebanese people.
</P>
<P>
A statement released here today by the Lower House's Foreign
Affairs Committee said the Israeli acts will put the region in
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
It urged world parliaments and international organizations to
take a firm stand to put an end to the Israeli aggression.
</P>
<P>
Jordan had claimed it was the first Arab country to show
support of the Lebanese government and the first to mediate
between Lebanon and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti held talks with his Lebanese counterpart Rafik
Al-Hariri by phone a few days ago and voiced Jordan's solidarity
with Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, during his meeting with Lebanese ambassador
to Jordan, also promised to provide the Lebanese refugees with
humanitarian assistance including tents, blankets and medicine.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister had made contacts with his Israeli
counterpart Peres and asked Israel to stop its air and ground
bombardment in south Lebanon which started last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli military operations in south Lebanon, designed to
paralyze the Shiite Moslem guerrilla group Hezbollah in
retaliation for its attacks on northern Israel, have killed about
30 Lebanese and wounded some 100, and forced 20,000 to abandon
their homes and flock to Beirut.

<HEADLINE> High Pay Takes too Much out of UK Companies' Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- British companies' profits are low
in international terms because labour is being paid more than can
be justified in terms of productivity, says a report released
today by an economic consultancy.
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared by the Centre for Economic and Business
Research (CEBR), says that low profitability has held back
companies' investment, allowing less scope for growth.
</P>
<P>
Douglas McWilliams, chief executive of the CEBR, says,"we pay
ourselves 1.5 times more than we can afford if we are to be
internationally competitive."
</P>
<P>
Over the next 25 years, pay needs to fall from a current 68
percent of companies' added value to about 40 to 45 percent to
bring British companies up to comparable levels of profit and
investment.
</P>
<P>
Pay and labour costs will need to rise by an average of 1.35
percent less than the growth in productivity over the period.

<HEADLINE> Looting Continues in Monrovia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Looting continued in the
Liberian capital of Monrovia at the weekend though rival
factions have agreed to respect a ceasefire reached
last Friday.
</P>
<P>
"There is no more fighting as such, but in some areas
where bandits plan to loot, fighting erupts," a report
reaching here today quoted a diplomat as saying.
</P>
<P>
All the shops and office buildings in the city have
been looted and most of them wrecked since the fighting
broke out nine days ago, the report claimed.
</P>
<P>
Looters roamed the city with assualt rifles, taking
away whatever they could carry in vehicles which they
stole from international aid agencies.
</P>
<P>
The fighting erupted in Monrovia following an attempt
of Liberia's collective presidency, or council of state,
to arrest a Krahn faction leader, Roosevelt Johnson,
on murder charges.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Krahn fighters loyal to Johnson still
hold about 600 hostages in their stronghold of the Barclay
Barracks, including 22 soldiers of the West African Peacekeepers
(ECOMOG) and 50 Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
A report quoted Charles Taylor, a vice chairman of the
six-man transitional Council of State, as saying that the
interim government would not negotiate with Johnson for the
release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
"As a government we are not going to negotiate with these
terrorists," Taylor said, adding that Johnson should surrender to
the government.
</P>
<P>
Currently troops of the Nigerian-led ECOMOG regional
peacekeeping force are being deployed around the Barclay
Training Center Barracks.

<HEADLINE> NATO Commander Visits IFOR Troops in Banja Luka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 15 (Xinhua) -- NATO Commander for Europe U.S.
General George Joulwan said today NATO will do everything to
maintain peace in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
While visiting Implementation Force (IFOR) based in Serb city
Banja Luka in northwestern Bosnia, he said that after the
successful deployment of the 60,000-strong IFOR troops, there were
enough forces in both entities in Bosnia to keep peace process on
track.
</P>
<P>
IFOR troops started flooding into Bosnia in mid-December of
last year to enforce the Bosnia peace agreement reached in Dayton,
the United States, a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
Joulwan expressed hope that complete freedom of movement would
be established throughout Bosnia soon and that Banja Luka, the
largest city in Serb entity, would cooperate to that effect. The
freedom of movement is still not fully realized in Bosnia which is
divided by two entities -- Serb state Republika Srpska and
Muslim-Croat federation.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether NATO troops would withdraw by the end of this
year after one-year mission, the U.S. general said that it was
still too early to speak about that. Under the Dayton accords, the
IFOR troops only stay in Bosnia for one year.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to see what will be done for peace in the next
eight months. At this moment, it is most important to realize the
civilian aspect of the agreement, that is the return of refugees,
preparation for elections and the raising of funds for
reconstruction, which I hope will be accomplished by the end of
the year," Tanjug news agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Joulwan also said he was pleased with the situation in IFOR's
Sector Southwest in Banja Luka area and was grateful for the
cooperation of local administration with the IFOR troops.

<HEADLINE> OAU Labor Commission Meeting Opens in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- "Many African countries
suffer from high and persistent unemployment and there is a
growing concern over problems of low pay and the reduced
employment prospects of unskilled workers due to the stagnation
of African economy."
</P>
<P>
This was said by Ethiopian Minister of Labor and Social
Affairs Hassen Abdella today while opening the 19th ordinary
session of the Labor Commission of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) at Africa Hall here.
</P>
<P>
Abdella mentioned problem of severe and grave indebtedness,
mismatch between the prices of imported and exported goods,
absence of the necessary skilled manpower, lack of peace and
stability and the problem of marginalization as some of the major
factors that caused africa's underdevelopment.
</P>
<P>
"Africa has been increasingly marginalized in the world
economy over the past two decades. Its share of world trade and
investment has declined to negligible proportions and isolated in
the face of other parts of the world," he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, Ee said, during the past few years, restructuring and
adjustment processes have been underway in many countries with
most of them already bringing positive results.
</P>
<P>
Director of the African regional bureau of the International
Labor Organization Mahmoud Ourabah said Africa is expected to
develop its natural resources toward the betterment of the
livelihood of Africans.
</P>
<P>
African governments should strengthen cooperation at national
and continental levels in order to eradicate contagious diseases
likely to be caused by the accumulation of unemployed people in
many cities, he added.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from OAU and the Economic Commission for
Africa also spoke at the opening session.
</P>
<P>
The four-day meeting will discuss various issues concerning
labor and employment.

JOHANNESBURG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela
will discuss with Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu
Buthelezi on the possible delay or staggering of the local polls
in the strife-torn Kwazulu/Natal Province.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana said Mandela is not
concerned about Buthelezi's weekend statements that the IFP would
quit the government of national unity should the elections not
proceed as scheduled on May 29.
</P>
<P>
"These kind of remarks have been made in the past, and there's
no reason to believe that they carry a different impact now than
they did before," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Mankahlana also confirmed that Mandela had met Pan Africanist
Congress leader Clarence Makwetu this morning about the poll's
fate as part of his continuing consultations with other political
party leaders.
</P>
<P>
He said although Mandela had not met National Party (NP)
leader F. W. de Klerk at the weekend, he had discussed the matter
with NP Secretary-General Roelf Meyer and NP Kwazulu/Natal leader
Danie Schutte.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is considering a possible postponement of the May 29
local elections following last week's reports from the African
National Congress in Kwazulu/Natal that violence and voter
registration irregularities were not conducive to free and fair
polls.
</P>
<P>
However, the president emphasized that a final decision on the
poll would be taken after the full consultations with all
interested parties in Kwazulu/Natal.

<HEADLINE> TAZARA Workers' Wives Stage Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- About 200 workers' wives of the
Tanzania-Zambia Railway (TAZARA) today staged a protest demanding
the railway authority remove some senior managers from their
offices.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of Zambia News Agency today, the women
with children on their back were demanding the removals of
Managing Director Antishe Mweemba and his Regional General
Manager Silas Mathantilo during their protest at the TAZARA
regional office of Mpika in Zambia's northern province.
</P>
<P>
They also threatened to beat up managers, forcing most of them
to flee their offices into hiding.
</P>
<P>
Police were called in to disperse the protesting workers'
wives by firing teargas following the stoning of a private
vehicle by the women.
</P>
<P>
The TAZARA authority dismissed about 2,000 workers at the
Zambia sector of the railway for participating in "the illegal
strike" in the past week.
</P>
<P>
The railway, built with Chinese assistance in 1970s, provides
landlocked Zambia with a new outlet to the sea.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Falling Rand Benefits Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A continuing fall in the
value of South Africa's local currency Rand, coupled with high
world maize prices and an expected local surplus, may benefit
the farmers.
</P>
<P>
Jan Grobler, Chairman of the National Maize Producers'
Organization, said here today that farmers are now more confident
than they were.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a local maize surplus of about two million tons
could be exported at favourable rates, which would earn valuable
foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Rand, which had been weak for a long time,
hit its recorded low of 4.19 against the Dollar in the financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is expecting a good harvest this year due to the
fact that there has been enough rainfall during the planting season
early this year throughout main agricultural areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
However, Grobler warned farmers and cooperatives against
selling their maize locally at current prices, which he described
as laughably low.
</P>
<P>
Maize Board Chief Economist Pieter Esterhuizen also said South
Africa might export maize valued at 1.2 billion Rand (about 316
million U. Dollars) in the marketing year beginning May 1.

<HEADLINE> French Proposal on Ceasefire Based on July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A French proposal on a ceasefire
between Israel and Lebanon, which will be brought to the region by
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette, is based on a "July
understanding."
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz made the remark today at
a press conference held in his office. Boueiz denied that the
French proposal contains a landing of a French force in Lebanon to
guarantee the ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Under the July understanding, a U.S.-mediated tacit agreement
which put an end to an Israeli blitz in south Lebanon in July
1993, Israel was asked to refrain from attacking civilian targets
in south Lebanon in exchange for a Hezbollah's promise to stop
firing Katyusha rockets at Jewish settlements in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz disclosed that the French proposal was formed following
contacts between de Charette and himself and a meeting between
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Al-Hariri and French President
Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting with Hariri in Paris Sunday night, French
President Chirac asked de Charette to "immediately go to the
Middle East" to mediate a ceasefire, according to a presidential
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Hariri said that Israel is a basic part in the July
understanding, but "it was Israel which has broken the
understanding."
</P>
<P>
He criticized the Israeli logic that the July understanding,
which talks about Hezbollah's stop of firing Katyusha rockets in
return for Israel's refraining from attacking Lebanese civilians,
limited the military operations to those between the resistance
and the Israeli army inside the Lebanese occupied lands.
</P>
<P>
"What Israel wants now is a stop of firing Katyusha rockets in
all cases," he said, "this means that Israel can launch
aggressions as it likes and carry out punitive operations in all
cases."
</P>
<P>
This means "Lebanon has no right at all to respond to (the
Israeli agressions), or the responses should be limited to those
inside the Lebanese regions, even if Israel is doing the most
disgusting things against the Lebanese people."
</P>
<P>
"This logic is unacceptable," the Lebanese foreign minister
added, stressing Lebanon's commitment to a reference to the July
understanding.
</P>
<P>
"The reference meets the need for all parties," he said, "and
it restricts a framework of the violence and (military)
operations, and prevents them from going beyond a certain limit to
threaten actually the Middle East peace process."

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Urges UN to Interfere with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's King Hussein today urged
the U.N. Security Council permanent members to interfere with and
halt the Israeli military operations in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with ambassadors of the permanent member
countries of the U.N. Security Council, the king told the
ambassadors that he hoped their countries would act promptly to
halt the military operations in Lebanon which, he said, would
bring the region back to the state of tension, conflict and
instability.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was seen here as part of Jordan's efforts to put an
end to military escalation in Lebanon. It is the first time that
King Hussein has appealed to the U.N. Security Council permanent
members to mediate a settlement of the conflict between Lebanon
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The King briefed them on Jordan's position toward the
situation in Lebanon, saying that the Israeli military operations
have posed a threat to peace in the region as they coincided with
the Israeli closure of Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
He said the operations have inflicted heavy casualties and
displaced thousands of unarmed Lebanese civilians.
</P>
<P>
He described the events in Lebanon as "grave," noting that
they would derail the peace process together with the harsh
Israeli closure of the Palestinian self-rule areas. The closure
was imposed late February following a spate of suicide bombing
attacks in Israel and has caused great sufferings to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Jordan today also announced Prime Minister Abdul Karim
Kabariti's short visit to Israel Tuesday as part of Jordan's
intensive diplomatic efforts led by King Hussein on the latest
development in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister is expected to outline Jordan's position
toward the development in Lebanon and discuss an end to the
tension that has started to engulf the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jordan's Lower House of Parliament denounced here
today Israel's aggression on Lebanon and its military attacks on
civilians.
</P>
<P>
It said a total Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon was the
only solution to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti had also made contacts with his Israeli counterpart
Peres and asked Israel to stop its air and ground bombardment in
south Lebanon which erupted last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli military operations in south Lebanon, designed to
paralyze the Hezbollah, or the Party of God, in retaliation for
its attacks on northern Israel, have killed some 30 Lebanese and
wounded more than 100 others.

WASHINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Seven people were killed and
at least 30 others injured by a tornado which slashed northern
Arkansas Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
The twister, starting from Stone County and tearing through
Izard and Ozarks counties, ripped roofs off houses, uprooted
trees, knocked out power to more than 3,000 homes and destroyed a
mountain tourist campground, an Associated Press report said.
</P>
<P>
About 20 homes and six business buildings were damaged or
destroyed in Melbourne, Izard County, a State official said.
</P>
<P>
"It threw me out of the Jeep and into a ditch. I was going
across the road and I wasn't touching the ground," said Duane
Holland, a resident of Sylamore, Izard County. He landed in a
ditch.
</P>
<P>
At least three of the dead were tourists from Tennessee, said

MAPUTO, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa today agreed with his Mozambican counterpart
Joaquim Chissano on strengthening their bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Chissano told Mkapa, who is on his first state visit to Maputo
since he was sworn in as President of Tanzania in November last
year, that he is determined to push ahead the cooperative
relations with Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said his visit should be the starting point of a new
stage of cooperation between the two neighbors. Tanzania was a
firm supporter to Mozambique during the years of its struggle
against Portuguese colonial rule before 1975.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed issues of common interest,
including border trade and immigration, among others.
</P>
<P>
A Mozambican official, who declined to be named, said some
Tanzanians have recently crossed into Mozambique's Niassa
Province for "illegal" gold mining, an issue that Chissano might
raise during the talks.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa arrived at Maputo this morning. He is
scheduled to address the Mozambican parliament tomorrow and
leave on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Reaffirms Position on Turco-Israeli Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has asserted that no
country has the right, or will be allowed to ask any question to
Turkey on the military training agreement it signed with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Emre Gonensay made the remarks today
after meeting with Israeli Ambassador to Ankara Zvi Elpeleg.
</P>
<P>
The Turco-Israeli accord signed in February permits unarmed
Israeli war planes to use Turkish airspace for training
purpose.
</P>
<P>
But some Arab states and Iran criticized Ankara for "bringing
instability to the region" by signing such an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Elpeleg briefed Gonensay on the latest development concerning
Israel's raids on Hezbollah guerrilla targets in Lebanon, giving
a clear message that the two countries had to stand firm against
the Arab world's criticism of the deal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa has canceled
his planned visit to Ankara due to an emergency meeting of the
Arab League on the Israel attacks.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Nurettin Nurkan said the
cancellation had no relation to any Egyptian displeasure over
the Turco-Israel deal.
</P>
<P>
Local Anatolia News Agency reported that Foreign Minister
Gonensay Tuesday would receive Lebanese Ambassador Cafer Muhammed
Muawi.
</P>
<P>
Anatolia quoted a Lebanese embassy official as saying that
Muawi would ask for Turkey's support to stop the Israeli
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Ankara last Friday issued a statement without condemnation of
Israel, except to urge the Jewish state to refrain from actions
that would harm civilians and deal a blow to the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"I have repeated to the Israeli Ambassador our concern
regarding civilian casualties. Utmost care should be taken to
prevent this," said Foreign Minister Gonensay after the meeting.

capital under fighting for the last 10 days, to reinforce his
standstill against Charles Taylor and other opponents.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today quoted Johnson's spokesman as
saying that the Krahn warlord had given the order because ECOMOG,
the West African peacekeeping force, had not prevented rival

Johnson has appealed to Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings, who
has been leading mediation efforts, to stop other factions from
pouring more fighters into Monrovia, and called for a meeting of

Fighting broke out in Monrovia 10 days ago following an

on murder charges.

JOHANNESBURG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Creating jobs on a large
scale and fighting crime were among a number of specific targets
south african government has set to boost reconstruction and
development, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the South Africa International Development Forum
in Pretoria, Mbeki said realizing these goals would affect every
activity of government departments, institutions and agencies.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from more than 130 countries in the world
attended monday's conference on international financial aid.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said other high-level targets included building a
powerful and internationally competitive south and southern
African economy.
</P>
<P>
This would be coupled with creating employment on a large
scale, said Mbeki, adding a national crime-prevention and
security strategy would be announced to protect citizens, to
secure the wealth of the country and to promote investment.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Mbeki also reiterated that the government of
national unity would furthermore be transformed into what he
called an efficient and responsive instrument of delivery and
empowerment.
</P>
<P>
He further stressed that government departments would continue
redirecting their budgets to achieve the goals of reconstruction
and development. Their performance would then be assessed on
their spending to improve the lives of those marginalized by past
apartheid policies.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the entire government expenditure program had to
be geared, he added.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Ambassador to Cyprus Explains Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli attacks against
Iranian-backed Hezbollah aim at ending the threat of rocket
attacks against the civilian population in northern Israel, said
the Israeli ambassador to the island today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Shemi Tzur said Israel has
maintained self-restraint for many months in the face of
continuous Hezbollah provocations aiming at undermining the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He said the operation is within Israel's inherent right of self
defense.
</P>
<P>
He said "operations are being conducted solely against
Hezbollah terrorist targets" and added "the government of Lebanon
bears much of the responsibility for the current crisis."
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government has been informed of the Israeli
positions on operation against Hezbollah in Lebanon, Tzur told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
He denied that Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres has excluded
the mediation of any other countries but the U.S. to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, he is welcoming anybody who wants to contribute to
the ending of this problem in the northern part of Israel by
convincing the Lebanese or the Syrians or the Iranians or those
who have contacts with the Hezbollah to end these attacks," Tzur
said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli ambassador also expressed fears concerning
Hezbollah threats of attacking Israeli targets outside the country
and said in this context increased security measures are being
taken in all Israeli embassies, including the embassy in Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> Man Plunging From Eight-Storey Building Lives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A 33-year old Chinese man has
survived a dramatic plunge from the eighth floor of a tower block
in Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province,
according to April 13 issue of Yangcheng Evening News.
</P>
<P>
The man, named only as Ye, was watering his plants when he was
reported to have accidentally slipped, said the paper which was
seen here today.
</P>
<P>
Not only did he survive, but he escaped with just minor
injuries.
</P>
<P>
He owes his life to the fact that by a stroke of good luck he
landed on a bunk bed.
</P>
<P>
The bed, with its thick quilt, broke his fall. But a security
guard sleeping on the lower bunk was slightly hurt.
</P>
<P>
As Ye fell he crashed through live power lines close to the
building and crashed through the roof of a single storey dormitory
building used by neighborhood security guards.
</P>
<P>
Mr Ye had apparently tried to move a basin of flowers, and fell
off the building in the night darkness.
</P>
<P>
Other guards in the dormitory said they heard a big "bump" in
their room, and thought it might be a gas explosion.
</P>
<P>
Soon they discovered a fat man showed up in their room, slowly
got to his feet from the broken bed, brushed down his dirty
clothes, clapped his hands, threw his hips back, and looked as
though nothing had happened.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Refuses Direct Talks With Dudayev </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today ruled out the possibility of direct peace talks with Chechen
separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of servicemen in the southern Krasnodar
region this morning, Yeltsin branded Dudayev as a "bandit" and
stressed that "I shall never sit at the negotiating table with"
him.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said the Chechen secession would not be negotiated in
any case, noting "Chechnya will always be within the Russian
Federation."
</P>
<P>
Dudayev has agreed to hold talks through mediators including
King Hassan II of Morocco, said Yeltsin. Other possible mediators
are Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, head of the Russian
Muslim republic of Tatarstan Mintimer Shaimiyev and Turkish
President Suleyman Demirel.
</P>
<P>
Dudayev was driven out of the regional capital of Grozny after
Russian troops quelled the republic's independence revolt in
December 1994.
</P>
<P>
The bloody conflict in Chechnya, marked with sporadic
ceasefire, has caused heavy casualties on both sides.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who is actively preparing for the June presidential
election, also told the meeting that he was ready for a "historic
compromise" on Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
He said that he was prepared to grant the rebel republic in the
Northern Caucasus maximum autonomy within Russia and promised to
end hostilities there.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of the use of force, the Dudayev formations have
been seriously depleted," Yeltsin said. But he admitted that the
Chechen problem cannot be fully resolved by force alone.
</P>
<P>
The Russian President warned that those who attempted to take
advantage of his good will to mastermind new terrorist activities
would make a mistake.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Russian troops started their three-stage pull-out
from Chechnya, which is expected to be completed in November. But
over 10,000 Russian forces will remain in Chechnya, according to
earlier reports.

<HEADLINE> UN Survey Points out Poor Economies in Asia-Pacific </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Most of the least developed and
island economies in the Asia-Pacific recorded economic growth
rates well below the average figure of 7.8 percent achieved by the
region's other developing countries and areas in 1995, said a UN
survey released today.
</P>
<P>
Negative growth in Central Asian republics also persisted,
according to the economic and social survey of the performance of
the region in 1995, compiled by the UN Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and launched here
today.
</P>
<P>
It said some of the least developed countries, such as
Bangladesh, Laos and Nepal, have improved their growth performance
in recent years, but for most of them, the growth rates fell far
short of what was required to alleviate their extreme economic
hardship.
</P>
<P>
In the Pacific island economies, with a few exceptions, growth
rates hardly exceeded two percent and their vulnerability to
exogenous shocks remained as serious as ever, the survey asserted.
</P>
<P>
The economies in transition, especially those of Central Asia
and the Russian Federation, continued to suffer from a severe
economic plight as most of them were still experiencing output
contraction in 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, the rates of decline became pronouncedly less than
earlier years and some of them even showed positive signs of a
recovery towards the end of 1995, which could last into 1996 and
beyond, said the survey.
</P>
<P>
The most spectacular achievement appears to have been the
success of Armenia in posting a high positive rate of growth in
1995.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, inflation rates remained quite high in the
least developed economies. Inflation rates exceeded 20 percent in
Cambodia, Myanmar and the Maldives, although the rates in Cambodia
and Myanmar had dropped substantially.
</P>
<P>
Bhutan, Laos and Nepal succeeded in bringing down their
inflation rates to a single-digit figure in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In Central Asian republics and Russia, the hyper-inflationary
price escalation slowed somewhat in 1994 and early 1995, but
inflation remains a fundamental challenge to their reform and
restructuring efforts aimed at establishing market-oriented
economic regimes.
</P>
<P>
Chronic budget deficits with liquidity overhang, coupled with
supply shortages, continued to feed the inflation process that
burst out with the initial moves towards economic reform in the
early 1990s, said the survey.
</P>
<P>
The Asia-Pacific region has 13 least developed economies --
Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Kiribati, Laos, the
Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu and
Vanuatu.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Reynolds Metals Company, the
world's third largest aluminum company, is to vigorously expand
markets in China
</P>
<P>
At a seminar on the company's key product, Reynobond, held
today, sales and technical staff from Reynolds introduced its
properties to experts from the architectural industry.
</P>
<P>
With two thin aluminum sheets sandwiched with high-density
vinyl, Reynobond can be used as decorative plates on the exteriors
of buildings, because of its flatness and ease of formability,
said Randolph N. Reynolds Jr., marketing administrator of the
export construction products division of the company.
</P>
<P>
He added Reynolds aims to enhance its presence in China with a
view to the country's booming market for construction materials.
</P>
<P>
Reynobond has already been used in southern Chinese cities such
as Shanghai. The US company has sold 150,000 sq. m. of Reynobond
in China, and aims at selling one million sq. m. It plans to
target potential markets in northern China.
</P>
<P>
Reynolds has just signed an agreement with Bohai Aluminum, a
subsidiary of China International Trust &AMP; Investment Corporation
for a joint venture to produce aluminum foil. Reynolds invested a
total of 45 million US dollars in the venture, about 30 percent of
the total.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide sales for Reynobond was some 20 million US dollars
last year, and the total for Reynolds Metals Company reached seven
billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> 14-Month Old Boy Saves Big Pig in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese baby boy, just
14-months old, has saved the life of his best pal - a friendly pig.
</P>
<P>
The toddler scrambled to raise the alarm when he discovered his
porky playmate fighting for his life with his head jammed between
iron railings.
</P>
<P>
The terrified pig only had minutes to live when the toddler's
father, an armed police officer in Shanghai, and a group of
soldiers, raced to help.
</P>
<P>
They managed to save the pig, to squeals of delight from the
boy.
</P>
<P>
The little son of the armed police officer was too young to
speak clearly, or even walk steadly, but he loved to play with the
200-kg pig in the father's barracks.
</P>
<P>
He enjoyed playing chasing games with the pig. And the pig was
so mild and friendly that it would never scream at the boy, making
the two a pair of friends.
</P>
<P>
The boy went to the pig's home again, but was surprised to find
the pig's head clutched between two iron railings. It was foaming
at the mouth and its eyes seemed to have popped out of his head.
</P>
<P>
The quick thinking boy realized there might be something wrong
with the pig, and rushed back to his home for help. He tried to
pull his father to the pig and mumbled "Pig! Pig!".
</P>
<P>
The father and some other soldiers rushed to find the pig, out
of breath and dying. They immediately broke the iron railings and
saved the pig's life.
</P>
<P>
The boy, who was very worried and concerned about his playmate,
started to clap his small hands and was all smiles again.

</P>
<P>
Carbon dating tests in the Melbourne University proved that
some of the tools were 35,000 years old.
</P>
<P>
It was previously believed that rainforest conditions were so
harsh that it was impossible for hunter-gathers to find enough
food until agricultural technology was advanced in the last 3,500
years.
</P>
<P>
Before Pavlides' discovery, the earliest human habitation sites
in rainforest were found in Africa and South America, which dated
back to 10,000 years.
</P>
<P>
The tools unearthed from one meter underground in New Britain
indicate that hunter-gathers were doing well in the rainforest
35,000 years ago. Some of the tools still have plant residues on
their edges.
</P>
<P>
This provides an invaluable clue for researchers to identify
the food sources of ancient people, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to carbon testing methods in the Melbourne University,
she was able to establish the chronology of the site by
determining the age of the volcanic ash.
</P>
<P>
During two phases of work over the past few years, 15 trenches
have been dug and over 4,000 artifacts have been discovered, with
their dates spanning the range between the last 6,000 to 35,000
years.
</P>
<P>
These findings have filled in the blank in the Pacific
prehistory between 3,500 and 10,000 years ago, the period just
before human colonization of the Pacific islands, the reports
claimed.

STOCKHOLM, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Military and civilian officials
attended a closed-door seminar on Bosnia here on Monday, local
news report said today.
</P>
<P>
Participants of the seminar, hosted by Swedish Defense Minister

Peace Implementation Force (IFOR), and Carl Bildt, former Swedish
prime minister and international mediator who is now responsible

been successful in Bosnia and Bildt's efforts were starting to pay
off.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Ambassador to Cyprus
Shemi Tzur today denied reports in the Cypriot press claiming
that the Israeli jets have violated the Nicosia Flight Information
Region (FIR).
</P>
<P>
"We are not doing this sort of things and I do not know where
it (the information) comes from," Tzur told a press conference
here.
</P>
<P>
He was asked to comment on reports on Cypriot private TV
channel "Sigma" Monday night that Israeli fighters violated the
Nicosia FIR on Sunday between 9:00 and 10:00 a.m. local time
(06:00 to 07:00 GMT).
</P>
<P>
According to Sigma, the planes were heading toward
south-eastern Turkey in the framework of a recent Turkish-Israeli
defense agreement.
</P>
<P>
Tzur said the first he heard about the violation of the
Nicosia FIR was in the Cyprus press and added that he had not been
contacted or notified by the Cyprus government on the issue.
</P>
<P>
He added that the usual custom is that if Israel is to use any
country's FIR, it will notify it before and ask for permission.
</P>
<P>
Tzur reaffirmed that Israel considers Cyprus a friendly
country.

<HEADLINE> China to Strictly Examine Talent Fairs for College Graduates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Sponsors of talent fairs for
college graduates in China will have to get advance approval from
educational departments.
</P>
<P>
The move has been introduced following a decision made by the
State Education Commission (SEC).
</P>
<P>
An SEC official said that any talent fair related mainly to
college graduates should be sponsored by departments in charge of
job assignment for college graduates, and colleges and
universities.
</P>
<P>
As Chinese people felt no more strange with "two-way choices",
meaning employers and employees can choose each other according to
their wishes or needs, more and more talent fairs, or talent
demand and supply meetings, were being held in big cities and even
smaller cities across the country.
</P>
<P>
The official said that sponsors should apply to the SEC for
examination and approval if their talent fair runs across two or
more provinces. Other departments have no right to approve such
fairs.
</P>
<P>
The SEC warned in a circular recently issued that units without
approval or authorization are forbidden to interfere with the work
of job assignment for college graduates, in the name of "talent
markets".
</P>
<P>
It also asked ministries and departments concerned to fulfill
job assignments as soon as possible. Colleges and universities,
too, are responsible for helping students to find jobs.
</P>
<P>
College education used be paid by the government, who in turn
assigned jobs to college students when they graduated. A reform
enabled some colleges and universities to charge students part of
the tuition fees starting from 1994.
</P>
<P>
Self-paying students will have the freedom to find jobs by
themselves. Almost all 1,054 colleges and universities of China
will follow the "pay-to-learn" reform next year.

Motor Company at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China, the largest developing country, and the

</P>
<P>
Since early April, the minister has been leading an inspection
team to forest areas in the Greater Xing'an Mountains in Inner

growth in Inner Mongolia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Xu called on local government officials to put fire prevention
in forest areas above anything else.
</P>
<P>
Local officials should put anti-fire measures into practical
action, by carrying out overall and thorough inspections of fire
precaution measures in grassroots administrative units such as
townships and villages.

BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- China today said it hopes the
forthcoming meeting between Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen and US Secretary of State Warren Christopher will benefit
the improvement and development of Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
This was made clear by Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang,

At their meeting scheduled on Friday in the Hague, Shen said,
Qian and Christopher will jointly review the newest developments
in bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese side will take this opportunity to urge the US

<HEADLINE> EC Calls for Dropping Curbs on Scrap Metal Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC) today
urged Romania, Bulgaria and Poland to phase out their export
restrictions on ferrous scrap, a vital raw material for steel
production.
</P>
<P>
An EC spokesman said the EC has also persuaded Russia to reduce
its export tax on scrap during negotiations on scrap trade.
</P>
<P>
He said the EC's negotiations with those Eastern European
states aimed to get more supply of ferrous scrap and set an agreed
date for full liberalization of the scrap trade.
</P>
<P>
Export bans or restrictions on scrap, the spokesman said, have
"artificially" lowered domestic scrap prices in Central and
Eastern Europe to as cheap as 40-50 ECUs per ton, compared with
the average price of 90-110 ECUs per ton for the EU states.
</P>
<P>
The EC has been working to have scrap restrictions removed by
non-EU member countries since 1994.
</P>
<P>
EC statistics showed that its scrap import from Central and
Eastern Countries (CEECs) in 1994 fell by 18.4 percent to 1.64
million tons and that the CEECs' share in the total EU imports of
ferrous scrap dropped 40 percent in 1994 from 55 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
An extra 375,000 tons of scrap, worth some 25-35 million ECUs
(one ECU equals 1.3 U.S. dollars) will be sold to EC member states
in 1996 by Romania, Bulgaria, Poland and the Slovak Republic,
according to the EC.

KUALA LUMPUR, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Three Malaysian youth groups
today urged the United Nations to lift the economic sanctions
against Iraq as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The three organizations are the Youth of United Malays National
Organization, the Malaysian Youth Council and the Non-Aligned
Students Youth Organization.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement released today, the organizations said the
UN economic sanction had led to high levels of death among Iraqi
children and an increase in the sick and elderly in the country
because of a severe lack of food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, some non-governmental organizations launched a
campaign in Malaysia to raise funds for Iraqi children. They
urged Malaysians and the international community to donate aid of
any form to help Iraqi children.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Import Rice to Meet Local Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka will import 600,000
tons of rice this year to meet an expected drop of 60 percent in
the country's production after a severe islandwide drought,
sources from the Food Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The shortage is anticipated despite current sufficient rice
stocks for consumption at a monthly rate of 160,000 tons in the
next three months.
</P>
<P>
The government has noted a significant drop in the usual rice
supply by farmers to the Paddy Marketing Board, which entails rice
imports to meet the local demand, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka, chasing receding rice production targets for many
years, had to import rice in the 1950s, mainly from China and
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
However, it has become self-sufficient in rice supply since the
1980s with the diversion of the Mahaweli River to the country's
rice bowl in North Central province and with changing consumption
patterns.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Sri Lanka had been exporting small quantities of rice
to the Maldives in the past three years.

<HEADLINE> Iran Supports Iraq's Return to Oil Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Iran today voiced its full
support for OPEC's decisions related to Iraq's return to the
international oil market.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazedeh stated that Iran
pledged cooperation in implementing appropriate measures designed
to absorb Baghdad's oil exports.
</P>
<P>
He also outlined Tehran's stance on the present situation of
the oil market, stressing the necessity to stabilize crude oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
Aqazedeh made the statement while meeting with the visiting
President of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) Omar Makhloufi.
</P>
<P>
Makhloufi arrived here Monday to exchange views with Iranian
officials. He was accompanied by a delegation that included OPEC
Secretary General Rilwanu Lukman.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the two sides
discussed ways to stabilize the international oil market.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed the observance of OPEC quotas by
its members and the limited re-entry of Iraq in the oil market.
</P>
<P>
However, it is still not clear when Iraq will be allowed
to return to the oil market.
</P>
<P>
On April 8, the third round of talks between Iraq and the
United Nations began in New York.
</P>
<P>
If Iraq agrees to limited oil sales under U.N. Resolution 986,
it will be allowed sales of about 600,000 bpd at current prices,
to raise revenue of 2 billion U.S. dollars over a period of six
months for buying food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the main agenda in the upcoming OPEC
meeting on June will be Iraq's return to the oil market.
</P>
<P>
If Iraq accepts the U.N. arrangement, it would seem that Saudi
Arabia carries the primary responsibility to reduce its output to
make room for Iraqi crude exports to the market.
</P>
<P>
Turning to his meetings with oil officials and heads of state
of OPEC member countries in the Persian Gulf, Makhloufi said all
of them were decisive in supporting OPEC and its decisions in
confronting present oil market conditions.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC delegation earlier visited Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar
and the United Arab Emirates.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Anti-Inflation Prospect Rosy in S.E. Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Since Southeast Asian countries
regard anti-inflation as one of their policies of priority, they
seem to see a rosy prospect in the battle as most of them
succeeded in reducing or stabilizing inflation over the past
years.
</P>
<P>
Inflation rate in Brunei came down to 2.4 percent in 1994 from
4.3 percent in 1993, said a survey released by the United Nations
Economic and Social Commission of Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP)
today.
</P>
<P>
Government policies on price controls and subsidies on
essential goods and petroleum to bring down the inflation in the
year contributed to the lower rate in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Brunei depends heavily on imports and its inflation rate is
largely determined by inflation in the source countries and
fluctuations of the exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate in Malaysia remained below 4 percent over
the last three years, with the figure for 1995 estimated at 3.5
percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's remarkable achievement was attributed to its
comprehensive package of monetary, fiscal and administrative
measures to combat inflation, including controlling non-essential
consumption expenditure and encouraging public investment aimed at
easing supply constraints.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines' inflation rate was estimated lower than 8
percent in 1995, against 9.0 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Singapore, a traditional low inflation economy, could have an
inflation rate of 2 percent in 1995 in comparison with 2.3 percent
in 1993 and 3.1 percent in 1994, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Exchange rate appreciation of the domestic currency in recent
years has kept imported inflation in check, which is important in
Singapore's highly open economy.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the inflation rate in Indonesia rose to 9.2 percent in
1994 from 7.4 in 1992, while the figure for 1995 was estimated at
10 percent, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
The higher rate can be attributed mainly to disruptions in food
supplies due to unfavorable weather conditions, heavy investment
in construction projects, increased public expenditures, and less
restrictive monetary policies.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate in Thailand was at around 5.8 percent in
1995, higher than 5 percent in 1994 and 3.3 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Higher overseas demand of exportables such as rice, chicken,
marine products led to higher domestic prices. The increase in
civil servants salaries and minimum wages also contributed to the
higher inflation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam successfully brought down inflation from 67.5 percent
in 1991 to 17.5 percent in 1992, and then to 5.2 percent in 1993.
But the figure rebounded back to 14.4 percent in 1994 and stayed
around that level in 1995.

abandon the use of anti-personnel land mines.
</P>
<P>
The Deutsche Press Agency (DPA) reported that Ruehe wrote a

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- China and Finland should
supplement each other with their respective advantages, strengthen
cooperation and support each other in more fields, said Li
Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), in Beijing
today.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks at a meeting with visiting Finnish
President Martti Ahtisaari in the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
Finland leads the world in some fields, while China has its own
advantages in economic development, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Though separated by distance and despite many differences,
China and Finland have a lot in common or in similarity, Li said.
Domestically, he explained, both countries are devoting energy to
developing economies and improving people's living standards.
Internationally, the two countries have had friendly cooperation
on many issues.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, bilateral relations are developing rapidly,
featured by big increases in two-way trade and active exchanges in
education, culture and science and technology.
</P>
<P>
"We are satisfied with all this," Li said, adding that he
believed the ongoing visit by the president would be of importance
to promoting the development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
As China is engaged in a large-scale modernization drive, it
needs to engage in cooperation with other countries on the basis
of mutual benefit, and learn foreign advanced technology and
experience in management, the chairman stressed.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari said he shared Li's comments on Sino-Finnish
relations. Finland is willing to continue its efforts to promote
the development of bilateral relations. The President said he has
come to China with great interest, expecting to deepen his
understanding about China through the visit.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting Li Ruihuan also briefed the guests on
China's economic situation and the building-up of the country's
legal system.

Beijing, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists today revealed
that they have discovered a superstar outside the galaxy.
</P>
<P>
Supernova is one of the rarely observed star outbursts in which
the maximum brightness may reach 100 million times that of the sun.
</P>
<P>
"The newly-discovered supernova was located at the
constellation of Corvus and was about 65 million light years away
from the earth," researchers from the Beijing Observatory under
the Chinese Academy of Sciences said.
</P>
<P>
China kept the earliest records of the outbursts of
supernova.The earliest record of supernova date back as early as
3,000 years ago in the Shang Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Observatory began a project of systematic search for
supernova last December.
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe that the study of supernova may help
astronomers solve mysteries such as black holes, neutron stars,
the origin of stars, and evolution of the universe.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Says U.S. Proposal Stems from July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz disclosed here today that a U.S. proposal on a ceasefire in
Lebanon, which had been delivered to him, was derived from what
was called the "July understanding."
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held in his office this afternoon, the
foreign minister said, "We received an American project stemming
from the july understanding of 1993 in order to reach a ceasefire
in Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
He added that this project needs a study by Lebanese leaders,
announcing that he had informed President Elias Hrawi the contents
of the U.S proposal.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said that a tripartite meeting will be held this
afternoon by President Hrawi, House Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri to study this proposal.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had asked the U.S. ambassador, who delivered
the proposal to the foreign minister, a clarification by
Washington on some parts of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
"After this clarification, Lebanon will take a suitable
position on this proposal," the foreign minister underlined.
</P>
<P>
On the contents of the U.S. proposal, the Lebanese minister
stressed that it was derived from the July understanding of 1993,
and "did not touch a stop of the resistance, nor define a
framework for the military operations in south Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
But Boueiz emphasized a refusal to cancel the legitimate right
of resistance.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Lebanese leaders had not, until now, been
informed with any French proposal, pointing out that French
Foreign Minister Herve De Charette was visiting Israel and Syria
and Lebanon was waiting for him to be in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed official sources in the Beirut Foreign Ministry
reported that the foreign minister, after receiving the
U.S. proposal from U.S. Ambassador in Beirut Richard Johns, had
called Hrawi and informed him the contents of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with Boueiz in the foreign minister's office,
the U.S. diplomat announced that the Lebanese officials would
discuss the U.S. proposal and would make a response after the
study. But he declined to make public the details of the
U.S. proposal.
</P>
<P>
Johns stressed that Washington is working hard in order to stop
the present "violence" in Lebanon since it considers that the
violence is not useful for any party.
</P>
<P>
He said that the current contacts were concentrated on a
ceasefire, and described his talks with the Lebanese foreign
minister as "useful."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that all the parties were making intensive
diplomatic contacts in order to put an end to the present crisis.
</P>
<P>
Johns ruled out a visit to be paid soon by U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State for Middle East Affairs Robert Pelletreau to
the region, and denied his knowledge on a French or an Iranian
suggestion for defusing the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foreign minister announced Monday that French
Foreign Minister Herve De Charette was bringing with him a
proposal for a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz disclosed that the French proposal was based on what
was called the "July understanding," stressing that the proposal
had been crystallized for several days.
</P>
<P>
De Charette arrived in Damascus this morning, after holding
meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres and Foreign
Minister Ehud Barak in Tel Aviv Monday.
</P>
<P>
The French foreign minister admitted that it was difficult for
him to mediate a solution at present.
</P>
<P>
The July understanding is a U.S.-mediatedly tacit agreement
which put an end to an Israeli blitz in Lebanon in July, 1993,
and under which Israel was asked to refrain from attacking
civilian targets in south Lebanon in an exchange for a Hezbollah
promise to stop border-crossing attacks at Jewish settlements in
northern Israel.

<HEADLINE> Over 80 Percent of Corruption Cases Reported by Ordinary People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Over 80 percent of bribery and
corruption cases handled by China's procuratorial organs were
reported by ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
According to a national working conference held today in
Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province, China's
procuratorial organs handled more than 600,000 leads about
embezzlement and bribery in the past three years, more than 80
percent of which were reported by citizens.
</P>
<P>
China has issued a series of measures to encourage people to
report corruption cases to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
Since it was set up seven years ago, the reporting center of
the Shanghai Municipal Procuratorate has handled more than 110,000
cases with leads provided by citizens. Over three quarters of the
allegations were about embezzlement and bribery.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, procuratorial organs across the
country handled 5,241 cases concerning retaliation against people
who reported the alleged wrongdoings, and awarded 10,128 people
for providing clues.
</P>
<P>
In the last three years the procuratorial organs subjected
428,000 allegations to preliminary examination, and put 216,000 of
them under official investigation, 172,000 of which were about
embezzlement and bribery, resulting in the recovery of 7.19
billion yuan in embezzled funds.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Asia Faces Challenge in Urban Infrastructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- With rapid economic growth in the
past three decades in Asia, urbanization has quicken its step in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Three decades ago, only some 18 percent of the Asian population
lived in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Asia's urban population was estimated to be 1.1
billion, which means that one in three Asians lives in urban
areas.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2020, the region's urban population is expected to
increase to 2.5 billion and represent more than half of the total.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts said that urbanization is a normal process of
economic development. However, the rapid urban growth has led to
a host of problems.
</P>
<P>
Severe infrastructure bottlenecks in water supply, sanitation,
drainage, waste management and transport have to be alleviated.
</P>
<P>
Concerted efforts are required to address urban poverty,
improve the urban environment and strengthen urban management.
</P>
<P>
In Asia, according to the Asian Development Bank, almost seven
trillion US dollars in today's prices will be required for
investment in urban infrastructure over the next quarter of a
century.
</P>
<P>
This is equivalent to some 280 billion US dollars every year
and exceeds by far the current levels of expenditure throughout
the region.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of a three-day seminar on urban
infrastructure finance, ADB President Mitsuo Sato said today that
complexity of urban infrastructure and magnitude of the financing
"require us to be dynamic and innovative."
</P>
<P>
He said, "Public sector alone cannot meet all the requirements.
A major reorientation of development plans and priorities, and
search for new approaches to urban infrastructure finance are
among the key policy concerns facing the developing member
countries."
</P>
<P>
"The need for additional resources also has encouraged many
governments to look towards an expanded role for the private
sector as partners and providers of infrastructure and service,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Philippine Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo said
that in providing needed infrastructure, governments traditionally
depended on their capacity to mobilize public financing.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, in recent times, because of limitations on
public finance, the trend has been toward involving private
enterprises in the provision of infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that by involving the private sector in
infrastructure development, quantitative and qualitative
improvements in this sector is possible in a very short time.

ROME, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) predicted here today that global
grain production will probably increase by 5 percent in 1996 to
reach 1.99 billion tons.
</P>
<P>
However, the FAO said in a report that the price will still
rise due to soaring demands for grain around the world.
</P>
<P>
The output of coarse food grain is expected to hit 860 million
tons with a remarkable increase of 9 percent, while wheat output
will grow by 5 percent to hit 570 million tons and rice output by
1 percent to reach 560 million tons, according to the report.
</P>

The FAO report in the meantime foresaw a reduction in the
output of oil-bearing crops in 1996 and a higher price for edible
oil.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Commercial Bank Criticizes IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Commerical Bank of Zimbabwe
today described as unrealistic and unworkable the conditions
imposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the
resumption of lending to finance the country's market reforms.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary, the bank said the IMF approach to the
government expenditure had been heavy-handed, and showed lack of
wisdom and essential information about problems being faced by
Zimbabwe to reduce the budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
While the bank accepts the view that uncontrolled spending
contributes to high inflation, conditions imposed by the IMF to
limit spending are "unrealistic given the economy's fragility and
sensitiveness to such natural disasters as drought".
</P>
<P>
The IMF, a major donor to Zimbabwe's market reforms launched
more than five years ago, last September withheld disbursement of
crucial balance-of-payments aid worth over 62 million U.S.
Dollars, saying it was unhappy with the government spending.
</P>
<P>
The bank also criticized the IMF for dismissing Zimbabwe's
aspirations to provide basic education to all sections of the
population.

<HEADLINE> UN Expects China's Economic Growth To Slow Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- China's economy is expected to
slow down and hover around nine percent this year and next, said a
report by the United Nations today.
</P>
<P>
China's inflation rate will also be on a downward slide, the
annual report on Asia and the Pacific region estimated.
</P>
<P>
China' economic growth slowed from 11.8 percent in 1994 to 10
percent in 1995, while inflation rate fell from 21.7
percent to 14.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Asia and the Pacific region's average
economic growth rate will drop from last year's 7.8 percent to 7.4
percent this year, and 7.2 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that China continued to lead the region in
economic development last year, despite austerity measures to
curb inflation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China's high inflation rate "impacted not only on
the average rate of inflation in the East Asian economies but also
on the whole group of developing countries in the region."
</P>
<P>
The report said, "the high inflation rate had an obvious impact
on prices in Hong Kong, which recorded an 8.5 percent inflation
rate in 1995."
</P>
<P>
A UN official explained that the UN was today distributing the
report in Beijing as well as widely in the rest of the world
today.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian PM Pays Short Visit to Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Karim Kabariti left here today for Tel Aviv for a short working
visit to Israel to broker a ceasefire agreement between Israel and
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, his first such trip since he assumed the
post of prime minister last February, Kabariti will deliver a
message from king Hussein to Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres
on the situation of Lebanon and the necessity to stop bloodshed
there.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister is expected to outline Jordan's position on
the developments in Lebanon and discuss an end to the tension
between Israel and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti's visit is the latest move in Jordan's efforts to end
the crisis in Lebanon after Israel launched military operations
in south Lebanon Thursday, which, Israel said, was in retaliation
for Hezbollah guerrilla attacks against northern Israeli
settlements from across the border.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli bombardments and air raids have killed at least
30 Lebanese civilians, wounded a lot more and displaced 200,000
residents in the air-raid-stricken area since Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the visit, Minister of Information Marwan Muasher
 said at Monday's weekly briefing that Jordan "is using its
relations with Israel as well as all other influential parties,
including the U.S. and European countries, to end the Israeli
military action in Lebanon and to resume the peace process."
</P>
<P>
King Hussein contacted Lebanese President Elias Hrawi Sunday
to express concern over the continuing crisis in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Muasher told reporters that the king was making his contacts
over the past two days and that "the results of the efforts will
be visible in the next two days." He also said that Jordan was
sending 10 tons of relief supplies to help the victims of Israeli
air raids.
</P>
<P>
Muasher said that Kabariti was the first Arab official to
contact Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Al Hariri to express
Jordan's concern over the situation in Lebanon and voiced
solidarity with Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also contacted Peres calling for an
immediate end to Israeli military operation in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein Monday urged the major world powers "to act
seriously and speedily to put an end to military operations
that endanger the peace process and are returning the region
to a state of tension, conflict and instability."

<HEADLINE> Uncertificated Medical Practice Exposed in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The arrest of a woman posing as a
doctor in Sri Lanka's national hospital in Colombo has led to the
discovery that as many as 25,000 unqualified "doctors" are
practicing in the country, medical sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The woman had reportedly often walked unsuspectedly in the
national hospital with a stethoscope around her neck, but
suspicions were aroused and the police were alerted when she
conducted her private practice at her home in the suburbs of
Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Police said she was a likely rebel suspect who was conducting
spy operations for the rebels and accused her of having stolen the
identity cards of several genuine doctors at the national
hospital, which were found in her possession.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, medical organizations have warned the government
that as many as 25,000 unqualified people were passing themselves
off as doctors in the country.
</P>
<P>
They urged the Pakistani government, the Health Ministry and
the medical profession to take prompt actions to eliminate this
menace to the country's health sector.

<HEADLINE> Surveys Boost Hopes of Feel-Good Factor Revival in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Hopes of a "feel-good factor"
revival have been boosted by two new surveys showing a sharp jump
in high street spending and a stronger housing market, according
to a BBC TV report today.
</P>
<P>
One survey, by the British Retail Consortium (BRC), shows that
the value of retail sales in March was 7.5 percent higher than in
the same month a year earlier, against a year-on-year rise of 3.6
percent in February.
</P>
<P>
It is the largest annual rise since the BRC began producing
sales data in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
The figures provided strong support for the view put forward by
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, that rapid consumer spending
growth would be the key to wider economic growth this year.
</P>
<P>
Figures were affected by the fact that Easter came earlier this
year than last.
</P>
<P>
But the consortium said that the figures still pointed to a
strong underlying annual growth rate of between 4.5 percent and 5
percent, a sharp rise from average monthly sales growth of 4
percent over the previous three months.
</P>
<P>
The other survey by the Royal Institution of Chattered
Surveyors found that March was the best month for the housing
market for two years, with more than two-thirds of its members
reporting an increase in activity.
</P>
<P>
The institution reported greater interest from house-hunters
during 1996 than for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Institution spokesman Tony Joyce said: "There is now almost
complete unanimity among chartered surveyor estate agents that
confidence is returning to the market. There are more registered
applicants and serious purchasers."

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Develops Financial Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 16 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province has built a financial network of 25,000 offices, or one
for every 2,700 people, giving them perhaps the best access to
financial services in China.
</P>
<P>
It is made up of many rural and urban credit co-operatives,
insurance companies, banks, and overseas financial institutions,
using new technology, and more than 20,000 computers.
</P>
<P>
In the Pearl River Delta, one of the most important areas for
Guangdong's economy, there are more than 1,600 ATMs, and more than
four million credit cards or other cards in use.
</P>
<P>
Because of these services, deposits were up more than 30
percent in 1995, accounting for more than 13 percent of the total
in China.
</P>
<P>
Not only have individuals benefitted from this, but also has
the local economy. Statistics show that between 1981 and 1994, the
financial sector in the delta added nearly 19 billion yuan to
Guangdong's economic output.
</P>
<P>
In Shenzhen, the special economic zone, commercial banks
arranged more than 120 billion yuan in loans, of which more than
10 billion yuan was targeted at key projects and key enterprises
and about 2.8 billion yuan was used for home mortgages. Shenzhen
used new financial instruments to help raise 35.3 billion yuan
last year, 60 percent more than in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The banks and insurance companies in Shenzhen recorded 4.7
billion yuan in profits in 1995, paid 1.6 billion yuan in taxes,
and had per capita profits of 220,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks in Shenzhen issued less than 1.5 percent of
the total number of loans in China, but contributed 20 percent of
the profits created by China's banks in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Industrial, Services Develop Slowly: UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A UN survey released here today
painted a grim picture of the development of Pakistan's industrial
and services sectors in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"The industrial production in Pakistan has grown at rather
unimpressive rates of around five percent during the past three
years," said the survey issued by the UN Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The survey attributed the bleak situation to the poor
performance of the country's large-scale industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
"A rate of expansion of more than eight percent in small-scale
industrial production, as well as rapid expansion in electricity
and gas, have sustained industrial production at the moderate
level of around five percent," it said.
</P>
<P>
"The performance of the services sector, with a growth rate of
around four percent, has also been rather lackluster," said the
survey.
</P>
<P>
"None of the service activities, including transport and
communication, trade and finance, housing or other miscellaneous
services, has shown any signs of accelerated expansion," it added.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Former Irish Prime Minister Albert
Reynolds said today Britain could create conditions leading up to
restoring the cease-fire by the Irish Republican Army (IRA).
</P>
<P>
Reynolds, who had played a key role in urging the IRA to
materialize a cease-fire in August, 1994, told BBC radio that he
had "guarded optimism" about the peace prospects for the troubled
Northern Ireland although the IRA still refused to give up
violence.
</P>
<P>
But the former prime minister stressed that the planned
all-party negotiations on the future of Ulster slated for June 10
had to "be seen to be real with a recognition that change has to
come about with agreement" among all sides involved.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that the all-party talks would be the only forum
in which an honorable solution to the conflict in the crisis-laden
Northern Ireland could be found.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the British government announced today that it will
soon publish a bill to set out the rules for the elections on May
30 to a peace forum in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The forum will be composed of 110 representatives elected from
10 political parties in Ulster. Delegates will then be selected
from the forum to attend the all-party talks.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Establishes Committee To Investigate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 16 (Xinhua)-- A multi-party committee
would be established to investigate the allged voter registration
irregularities in the May 29 local government elections in
Kwazulu/Natal Province, South African President Nelson Mandela
announced today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at his official Cape Town residence
after breakfast talks with Inkatha Freedom Party (ifp) leader
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Mandela said the committee would comprise a
representative from each party in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he would not make any decision on the fate of the
May 29 Kwazulu/Natal polls pending the committee's investigation
into the allegations.
</P>
<P>
Other committee members included local government elections
task group co-chairmen Frederick Van Zyl Slabbert and Khehla
Shubane, Provincial Affairs and Constitutional Development
Minister Chris Fismer and his deputy Valli Moosa.
</P>
<P>
The president said he had invited Buthelezi and Kwazulu/Natal
Provincial Local Government Minister Peter Miller to the
committee's first meeting on Friday, where members would receive
their instructions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Buthelezi said the president's idea would bring
down the ''high temperature'' in the province, and parties could
only benefit from the investigation, which would reveal the true
facts.
</P>
<P>
However, Buthelezi said if elections did not take place as
scheduled it was ''possible'' that the IFP would withdraw from
the government of national unity.
</P>
<P>
Miller also pledged to support Mandela and the committee 100
percent, saying he was delighted that an impartial body would be
charged with the responsibility to investigate whether the
voter's roll was all right or not.
</P>
<P>
The African National Congress in Kwazulu/Natal yesterday
formally called for the postponement or staggering of the local
polls, claiming that violence in the province and massive fraud
in the voters' registration process were not conducive to free
and fair elections.
</P>
<P>
After having been briefed by Fismer and Moosa last Thursday,
Mandela said a postponement or staggering might have to be
considered, but a final decision would only be made after
consultation with the affected parties. enditem

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Macao Insurance Business Eyes Mainland Life Insurance Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Macao insurance businesses are
paying great attention to China's mainland life insurance market,
and some have established representative offices on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Many of the Macao insurance companies, whose headquarters are
based in Canada, Japan, Portugal, Hong Kong, the United States,
Britain and Australia, are intended to tap the huge market potential
of life insurance business in China's mainland, said Si Chi Hok,
president of the Macao Insurers' Association.
</P>
<P>
The three locally-funded insurance firms are also interested in
opening offices on the mainland, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Macao's sluggish economy has slowed down the insurance
business," he said. "But many foreign insurance business still want
to come to Macao. It is because they expect a large life insurance
market in Macao, and also make Macao a headpost to tap the huge
market potential on the mainland."
</P>
<P>
Macao's 20 insurance firms, including five specially engaged in
life insurance, made a total of 683 million Patacas (about 87.5
million US dollars) by selling insurance policies last year.
</P>
<P>
While non-life insurance business recorded a slower growth rate,
the life insurance business marked an 18th excessive growth year in
1995. Life insurance income accounted for some 40 percent of all the
insurance income last year.
</P>
<P>
The life insurance in Macao is expected to have a continuous
expansion in the coming years, Si said, because of the following
factors:
</P>
<P>
-- Macao's economy and social structure have undergone great
changes since the early 1980s, and many elderly people have begun to
accept the idea of life insurance. In the past, they thought it
would be an evil omen to buy life insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
-- Macao residents' buying ability has been improved following
the improvement of living standard over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
-- People born in the baby boom of the 1980s in Macao will begin
entering society by the turn of the century to become new customers
of life insurance.
</P>
<P>
Si stressed, however, that in the long run the market potential
of Macao is limited as Macao is a small place and its per capita
insurance income has reached about 200 US dollars. The competition
will become even fiercer.
</P>
<P>
"In the future, when China opens its life insurance market to
full swing, life insurance businesses will shift their attention
from Macao further to the Pearl River Delta and other major cities
on the mainland," he said.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, a large part of the increase in life
insurance income originated from the Pearl River Delta, which
witnessed a fast economic growth over the past 16 years, Si said.
</P>
<P>
He predicts that after China resumes its sovereignty over Macao
in 1999, the existing insurance companies in Macao will make Macao a
headpost to enter the mainland market.

<HEADLINE> HSBC Introduces Hong Kong Bond Index </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation (HSBC) today introduced HSBC Markets Hong Kong
Bond Index, a benchmark that measures the performance of
top-quality Hong Kong dollar debt securities traded locally.
</P>
<P>
The index is intended to provide a broad-based yardstick for
fund managers and other investors to measure investment
performance in the rapidly expanding Hong Kong dollar debt market.
</P>
<P>
The index tracks the performance of top-rated Hong Kong dollar
debt, including issues by the Hong Kong Government's Exchange
Fund, the private sector and supranationals.
</P>
<P>
Its constituents will be reviewed regularly to include all new
qualifying issues, which must have a minimum issue size of 300
million HK dollars (38.7 million US dollars) and remaining
maturity in excess of one year.
</P>
<P>
As at March 29, 49 debt securities qualified for inclusion in
the index on a market weighted basis.
</P>
<P>
The index will be compiled monthly, taking into account price
movements and accrued interest, as well as proceeds from
reinvested earned interest. The index has a base of 100 which
corresponds to its value on December 31, 1993.
</P>
<P>
Stuart Gulliver, Hong Kong Bank treasurer and head of HSBC
Markets Asia-Pacific, said, "The rapid development of the Hong
Kong dollar bond market points to the need for a reliable,
broad-based index."
</P>
<P>
He said that the index will provide a yardstick for fund
managers to know how their portfolios are faring against the
overall market.
</P>
<P>
He said that the introduction of this benchmark will make the
Hong Kong debt market more attractive to investors, as it will
enable them to evaluate portfolios performance and assess the
market's overall attractiveness.
</P>
<P>
HSBC Markets is the treasury, capital markets and
foreign-exchange market arm of the HSBC and it was Hong Kong's
largest arranger of Hong Kong dollar debt in 1995, launching
nearly 12 billion HK dollars (1.55 billion US dollars) in debt,
equivalent to 32 percent of all local capital markets issues.

<HEADLINE> HK Newspaper Price War Tends to Ease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The price war among the Hong
Kong newspapers seems to ease as the "Tin Tin Daily News" today
raised its cover price back to five HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to Tang Lap-yan, chairman of the daily, the
fluctuation in the media industry has gradually slowed down as
Hong Kong's economy shows sign of recovering.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that his daily is the first newspaper which is able
and confident in bringing its cover price back on the normal
track.
</P>
<P>
Last December, "Oriental Daily News" cut its price to two HK
dollars, followed by the "Tin Tin Daily News", "Apple Daily",
"Sing Pao Daily News" and "Hong Kong Daily News".
</P>
<P>
The "Tin Tin Daily News" cut its price to two HK dollars at the
beginning, but raised it twice in March to three HK dollars and
four HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper battle in Hong Kong last December resulted in
close down of three newspapers including the "United Daily News"
and "Express News" with loss of 550 jobs.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A group of 119 Vietnamese
migrants returned by air to Hanoi, Vietnam today on the 33rd
flight under the Orderly Repatriation Program (ORP).
</P>
<P>
All of the returnees, comprising 77 men, 26 women, six boys and
10 girls, are from the northern part of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the Vietnamese migrants arrived in Hong Kong
respectively in 1989 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
The group brought to 2,398 the total number repatriated on ORP
flights since November 1991.
</P>
<P>
Recent development showed that the Hong Kong government tended
to accelerate the ORP program.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Hong Kong Correctional Services Department
carried out an operation to clear Section Two of the Whitehead
Detention Center (WHDC) and transferred 462 Vietnamese migrants to
the High Island Detention Center in preparation for closing WHDC
before 1997.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are still some 20,000 Vietnamese migrants
remaining in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Isles-Routed Goods Under Scrutiny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
is contemplating to impose a full import duty on imports entering
the mainland from Zanzibar in a move to curb tax evasion, the
local paper "Daily News" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Authoritative government sources said here on Monday that
imposition of a 100-percent import duty on goods from the isles
would be the lasting solution for the Zanzibar imports route
problem.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that top leaders of both the union and isles
governments were aware that the so-called Zanzibar route had
adverse impact on government revenue collection.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, the Customs Department would not accept
import documents for goods cleared in Zanzibar to enter the
mainland until the importer pays the taxes in full.
</P>
<P>
Importation of goods through Dar es Salaam, then re-routing
them to Zanzibar where importers pay import taxes and later
bringing the same goods to the mainland will not be accepted, the
sources added.
</P>
<P>
The Zanzibar route has been used to flood the mainland with a
wide range of consumer items.
</P>
<P>
"It is vital that a decision be made on the issue for the
betterment of the people -- mainland and isles," the sources
explained.
</P>
<P>
But, according to the law, goods imported into Tanzania cannot
be taxed twice. If imported duty is charged in Zanzibar, then
such commodities are not liable for taxation (import duty) when
entering the mainland.

<HEADLINE> HK SFC Drafts Composite Securities, Futures Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Securities and
Futures Commission (SFC) will introduce a new bill to consolidate
the existing laws governing the securities and futures markets.
</P>
<P>
The SFC published today a consultation document to seek the
views of the market on a draft of the composite Securities and
Futures Bill.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the SFC Anthony Neoh said that the related existing
laws are currently spread over some 11 ordinances and parts of the
Companies Ordinance. The situation was regarded as unsatisfactory
by the Securities Review Committee as many provisions cannot be
properly understood without reference to the other pieces of
legislation.
</P>
<P>
"The consolidation of the legislation will create a much more
convenient, one-stop, reference for the industry and market
practitioners and facilitate future legislative developments by
establishing a modern framework upon which future innovations can
be grafted," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the SFC made a review of the applicable laws in
1990, which resulted in the composite bill.
</P>
<P>
The review was essentially a consolidation effort, but it also
involved some updating and amendments to take account of
developments in the markets, technological advances, and changes
in regulatory philosophy and emphasis since the main body of the
laws was enacted in the 1970s, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the composite bill is expected to go into effect
in a few months.

<HEADLINE> UK Farmers Threaten to Sue Over EU Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The British National Farmers'
Union (NFU) has threatened to launch a legal action against the
European Union (EU) if it fails to lift the worldwide ban on
British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
An NFU spokesman is quoted by the BBC television as saying that
"we had been manoeuvring for a couple of weeks on whether to
launch a legal challenge" and took the case to the European Court.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed the ban last month after Britain said that
people might be able to develop the brain-wasting disease if
eating meat from animals infected by what was known as "mad cow"
disease.
</P>
<P>
The NFU will argue that the ban is unjustified on scientific
grounds and discriminates against British farmers.
</P>
<P>
The statement follows remarks by EU Agriculture Commissioner
Franz Fischler that the ban had not been brought in on health
grounds and he thought British beef was safe to eat.
</P>
<P>
Senior government ministers pointed out that Fischler's
comments could open the way to a legal challenge by the British
government in the European Court.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that what the commissioner said has cast
serious doubt over the legality of the ban," a senior minister
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg is to set
out the government's views on a possible legal action in the House
of Commons later today.
</P>
<P>
A European legal expert has said that the NFU stood a good
chance of initial success in the British High Court if it could
show the ban contravened the Treaty of Rome requirement that
restrictions should be based on sound scientific grounds,
according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, if the case were referred to the European
Court, it might prove to be very difficult to win the battle.

<HEADLINE> China's Foreign Debts up 14.8 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- China had 106.59 billion US
dollars worth of foreign debts outstanding by the end of 1995, up
13.78 billion US dollars, or 14.8 percent, over a year ago, the
State Administration of Exchange Control (SAEC) announced here
today.
</P>
<P>
A breakdown shows that 94.67 billion US dollars-worth, or 88.8
percent, of the amount was in medium and long-term debts, a rise
of 14.9 percent year-on-year. Short-term debts were valued at
11.92 billion US dollars, an increase of 14.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
In another analysis, 29.2 percent of the debts was owed by
government departments, 42.6 percent by financial institutions, 11
percent by domestic enterprises, 15.5 percent by foreign-funded
firms and 1.7 percent by leasing companies.
</P>
<P>
Calculated by accepted international standards, China's foreign
debt-service ratio was at 7.3 percent and foreign debt ratio was
at 69.9 percent by last year, both of which were below the
international warning levels.
</P>
<P>
The SAEC said that foreign capital inflow into China grew 10
billion US dollars annually during the Eighth Five-Year Plan
period (1991-1995), or by an annualized 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the currency structure and maturity terms of
China's foreign debts were generally rational, as the proportion
of short-term debts had moved downward.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange watchdog revealed that about 50 percent of
China's total foreign debts was in US dollars and about 27 percent
was in Japanese yen.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Arafat Hold Talks on Israeli Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak held talks here today
on the impact of a continuous Israeli closure on the Gaza Strip
and West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League's foreign ministers have scheduled an emergency
session here Wednesday to discuss the Israeli close and its
repeated attacks on Lebanese towns and villages.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who arrived here from Tunis earlier today, is seeking
Arab support to pressure Israel to lift its devastating closure on
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has been pressed by Israel to convene a meeting of the
Palestinian National Council (PNC) to remove clauses from the
Palestinian covenant calling for the destruction of Israel. But
a number of PNC members have not yet obtained Israeli permission
to enter the Palestinian areas for the session.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Arafat will also exchange views on the recent escalated
tension in south Lebanon, which was caused by repeated Israeli
bombardments and shelling on the outskirts of Beirut and south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli offensive in Lebanon has continued for six
consecutive days, with an Israeli air strike on a Palestinian camp
and retaliation by the Islamic resistance guerrillas, or Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
In Tunis, Arafat discussed the closure with Tunisian President
Zine al Abidine Ben Ali.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is expected to brief Mubarak on the obstacles created in
the self-rule areas after Israel has sealed off the Gaza and West
Bank since Feburary 25 after a series of suicide bombings by
Palestinian.
</P>
<P>
The closure has prevented thousands of Palestinians from
entering Israel to work and made it difficult for farmers to sell
their produce or for shops to import necessary goods.
</P>
<P>
Arafat earlier visited Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates to discuss the sanctions and seek support.

MANILA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Peter Wallace, president of the
Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), informed Philippine President
Fidel Ramos here today that the Philippines is the top choice of
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
According to Peter Wallace, the Philippines topped the list of
16 Asia-Pacific countries considered as the most attractive to
foreign investors in a survey sponsored by the Intelligence Unit
of the Economist, a London-based international business
publication.
</P>
<P>
Wallace said the comments and responses to the questionnaire
distributed to foreign participants of a survey, conducted during
the roundtable conference held last February in Manila ranked the
Philippines as "the number one country of highest interest to
investors in Asia in the coming years."
</P>
<P>
Wallace said the EIU survey showed that the Philippines'
biggest factors in attracting foreign investments are its educated
and skilled labor force, the English language proficiency of the
people and the long-term strategic importance of the country.

<HEADLINE> Religious Beliefs Coexist in Harmony in Xinjiang (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Some Uygur men can be heard
chanting praise of Allah in a mosque with a gold colored crescent
on its roof, while some Han people recite chapters of the Bible in
a church with a Christian cross on it, less than a block away.
</P>
<P>
Peaceful coexistence of different religions is something one
encounters daily in Hami, an oasis about 600 km to the east of
Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, in
northwest China.
</P>
<P>
The oasis is home to 430,000 people belonging to 24 ethnic
groups, of which the Uygur, Kazak, Hui and Han peoples are the
majority, and it symbolizes the style of life here and the
multiplicity of Chinese religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
More than 270 mosques, three Protestant churches, and one
Catholic church are scattered about the oasis. The Uygurs, Kazaks,
and Hui account for the majority of the nearly 120,000 Moslems,
and the majority of 600 Christians are Han.
</P>
<P>
Then there are the Mongolians and Han residents who pray before
images of Buddha in their homes.
</P>
<P>
Dayingmen Church, on the southern outskirts of Hami City, is
the biggest Christian church in the oasis, and there are three
mosques in immediate vicinity. The arched roof of the church
covers some 300 sq m of space that can accommodate a thousand
people at one time.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Qiaoyun, 28, graduated eight years ago from the Yanjing
Theological Seminary in Beijing and has been in Hami for five
years. She lives in a single-story house with a little yard to the
north of the church and is the only member of the Christian clergy
in the oasis.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the role of faith in her life, she replied, "I
am a servant of God, and my only hope is that God can be honored
and the brothers and sisters can live a serene life here."
</P>
<P>
The church is tranquil and solemn most of the time, with only
the singing of birds outside its window to interrupt the peace,
she said. The church was completed in 1989 and has a congregation
of about 500 people, most of them middle-aged women.
</P>
<P>
The door of the church faces east, and has a one-meter-high
cross above it. Flanking the door are a paired couplet in red
Chinese characters.
</P>
<P>
Not far away, across a narrow road is the home of Abdu Rahman,
a 60-year-old Uygur resident, who speaks fluent Chinese. Every
morning, he passes the church on his way to the mosque 500 meters
away. The neighborhood church does not affect his own beliefs, he
said. As a matter of fact, he often helps Zhang Qiaoyun with the
cleaning chores.
</P>
<P>
And, on the occasion of the festivals of Corban and Rozah,
Zhang is always a special guest at his home.
</P>
<P>
"The government policies are good, and our lives are much
better than several years ago," he said. "We Uygurs have mosques
and schools that teach the scriptures. We are quite happy living
here."

<P>
Zhang also has a neighbor named Ye Zhanyuan, who is a member of
the Hui ethnic group. She explains that relations with Ye are like
milk and water, meaning blended "in perfect harmony".
</P>
<P>
The church had to get water from a well at Ye's house until two
years ago, when it got running water. So, these days, in the
summer when Ye's well runs dry, he just goes to the church to
fetch water.
</P>
<P>
Every day, the 53-year-old Ye rides his bike two kilometers to
the "Shaanxi Mosque", which is 110 years old. On the lintel of the
mosque's gate are four Chinese characters for "religion brought
from heaven".
</P>
<P>
Religious gatherings at the mosque are presided over by the
imam, Ma Deshan, who is in his sixties and is still quite strong
and healthy.
</P>
<P>
"All those who come to the 'Shaanxi Mosque' are Hui people and
they listen to my recitations from the Holy Koran in Arabic," Ma
said. "I lead the prayer five times a day. Normally there are
about 300 people and on Friday there can be as many as 500," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Ma Deshan gets more than 200 yuan (24 US dollars) for living
expenses each month from the local government. He has three sons
and four daughters who work in business and for government
departments. Some of them are Communist Party members.
</P>
<P>
There are about 540 Moslim clergymen like Ma in the Hami
oasis. One of them is Haji Usman Xa, a senior imam of the Uygur
ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
The respected elder is nearly eighty, but his face glows with
good health. With the help of the government, he made a visit to
Mecca in 1984, hence the title Haji, for one who has made the
pilgrimage. He is now chairman of the Hami Islamic Association and
a member of the Xinjiang Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference, a major political advisory body
in China.
</P>
<P>
He is also a member of the China Islamic Association, which has
its headquarters in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Usman has seven sons and daughters, and 32 grandchildren. One
of his sons has carried on his religious work and is an imam in a
mosque. Eight of his grandchildren graduated from universities or
colleges and work in government departments, he told Xinhua
reporters through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
From time to time, the sound of religious chanting could be
heard outside the old man's house. The sound was actually coming
from a school of Koranic teaching. "They are reviewing their
lessons," he explained.

The school has 61 students, whose average age is 21. After
three years of study, they will go to mosques to act as the imam,
and receive a salary from the government similar to what graduates
of intermediate vocational schools get.
</P>
<P>
Some students who excel in their studies will be sent to the
Xinjiang Islamic Theological Institute to study for a bachelor's
degree.
</P>
<P>
Up to the 15th century, Buddhism was the leading religion in
Hami, which was a vital stopover on the ancient Silk
Road. Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam all came to China's
interior via that route. When Marco Polo passed through Hami in
the 1270s, those who greeted him were Buddhists.
</P>
<P>
Early in the 16th century, Buddhism began to decline and Islam
began to take its place. There were, at the same time, local
people who believed in other religions.
</P>
<P>
In the 1940s, some Han people from central China's Henan
Province established a Christian Association in Hami, and some
from Shandong Province set up their own Christian organization.
</P>
<P>
Having done research on religions, folklore specialist Zhang
Guoqiang said that Taoism, Buddhism, Shamanism, and Manicheeism
were all popular in Hami. Even today, some local people have
different religious customs and ceremonies in their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
However, the ten years of the Great Cultural Revolution
(1966-1976) wreaked havoc with the various religious groups. Then,
"The (disastrous) situation began to change in 1981," said Yimit
Ismail, a local official in charge of religious affairs in Hami.
</P>
<P>
"To protect the interests of religious believers is one of the
central parts of our religious policies," he said, adding that "at
present, people with different ethnic backgrounds and beliefs
share one common goal - how to get rich."
</P>
<P>
Hami is one of the areas in Xinjiang which have seen rapid
economic growth in the past several years. Average per capita
income of rural people last year exceeded 1,200 yuan (about 140 US
dollars), a great leap by local standards.
</P>
<P>
Huang Changyuan, a local Communist Party official, said that
the local Party committee and government will organize scholars to
discuss the essence of religious beliefs, to encourage more people
to take an active part in economic activities and to escape
poverty as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Austrian Federal Council President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today that China is willing, together with Austria, to
establish a "long-term and stable relationship of cooperation"
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks at a meeting with an Austrian Federal
Council delegation led by its president Johann Payer.
</P>
<P>
Expressing satisfaction with the smooth development of the
bilateral relations in the past years, Jiang said there are no
conflicts of fundamental interests between the two countries, the
Sino-Austrian cooperative scope has been steadily expanded, and
the two countries share extensive common interests in promoting
common development and safeguarding world peace.
</P>
<P>
So long as both sides strictly abide by the principles of
mutual respect, seeking common grounds despite differences,
non-interference in each other's internal affairs, and equality
and mutual benefit, the relations between the two countries would
surely achieve a long-term and stable development, Jiang said,
adding that this year sees the 25th anniversary of the forging of
diplomatic ties between the two countries and China hopes to
promote its relations of cooperation with Austria.
</P>
<P>
Payer said that the ongoing China trip by the delegation is of
particular significance at a time when the two countries are
celebrating the 25th anniversary of the establishment of
diplomatic relations. The visit, he said, would also help them to
know more about China and reinforce the friendship already
existing between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian people appreciated the Chinese government's policy
of coordinating social development, the raising of people's living
standard and maintaining social stability, as well as China's
attainments in economic, and scientific and technological
development, Payer said.

<HEADLINE> Asia-Pacific Region Remains Dynamic in Trade Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Asia-pacific economies
continued to prove more dynamic in trade growth, a annual survey
report from the Economic and Social Commission of Asia Pacific
(ESCAP) here today.
</P>
<P>
Several countries in East Asia have achieved growth rates of
nearly 30 percent in their exports in 1995, including China (29.8
percent) and South Korea (30.1 percent), according to the report
"Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific".
</P>
<P>
A number of Southeast Asian countries have reported export
growth rates more than 20 percent in 1995, such as Malaysia (28.3
percent), the Philippines (24.3 percent) and Vietnam (30 percent),
the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Several of the least developed countries in the region also
have achieved impressive rates of growth in exports, such as
Bangladesh (13.1 percent) and Nepal (15.0 percent), the survey
said.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary statistics also indicated that Cambodia, Laos and
Myanmar also saw significant growth in their exports last year.
</P>
<P>
Export earnings of most of the least developed and pacific
island economies in the region remain diverse, but some of them
have succeeded in diversifying the trade structure limited to a
few primary commodities or simple manufactured goods as textiles
and garments, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
Some of the transition economies of Central Asia and the
Russian Federation also have succeeded in achieving substantial
expansion of their trade with the rest of the world during the
period since 1993, the survey noted.
</P>
<P>
International trade plays a key role in the economic dynamism
of the developing countries of ESCAP region and most countries now
place strong emphasis on trade as a catalyst to growth and
development, the survey stressed.
</P>
<P>
The trade value of the region's developing countries has
continued to grow strongly at rates far exceeding the average rate
of growth in world trade, it said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Inflation Rate Reaches 13 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's inflation rate in
1995 reached almost 13 percent, a UN report said here today.
</P>
<P>
A survey issued here by the United Nations Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific figured out three reasons for
the inflation rate upward.
</P>
<P>
The first was the upward adjustment of utility charges and
petroleum prices.
</P>
<P>
The second was the sharp increase in the support prices of
agricultural commodities.
</P>
<P>
The third was the monetary overhang resulting from the
relatively large budget deficit, which was lower than that of 1994
but was still at a high level.
</P>
<P>
The survey said that a further upward adjustment of the
domestic price of petroleum as a consequence of the devaluation of
the Pakistan rupee late in 1995 may keep the inflation at a high
prevailing level in 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's export earnings rose
14 percent in 1995 after a nine percent growth rate in 1994, a UN
report said here today.
</P>
<P>
A survey issued here by the United Nations Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and Pacific attributed the achievement to the
better cotton crop.
</P>
<P>
Cotton and cotton products normally contribute 56 percent to
Pakistan's total export earnings.
</P>
<P>
The survey said that in 1992 and 1993, Pakistan's export trade
suffered a setback owing to the failure of the cotton crop which
was hit by floods and pests.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Pakistan got a cotton harvest and the export of cotton
yarn and cotton fabric increased 15.9 percent and 29.8 percent
respectively, it said.
</P>
<P>
The export of made-up textiles, rice, leather and carpet was
also on the increase in 1995, it added.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Warns North Israeli Settlers to Depart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 16 (Xinhua) -- In a statement issued after the
midnight the pro-Iranian Hezbollah or Party of God warned Jewish
settlers in northern Israel to leave their houses or "they
themselves should be responsible for their stay."
</P>
<P>
In the statement broadcast by its organ the Manar television,
the Shiite fundamentalist Hezbollah threatened that the Galilee
area in northern Israel would be hit by fire and Katyusha rockets
of the Islamic resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
"Based on instructions of the Islamic resistance's highest
leadership, the north of the occupied Palestine located between
the 33 grade of latitude, or the Lebanese-Palestinian border,
starting from the settlement of Naharya, passing with Safad
settlement until Saaben settlement on the fringe of the Golan
Heights, will be hit by fire and rockets of the Islamic
resistance, and any one present within this area should be
responsible for the results caused by its stay," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that "all the settling centers, settlements,
economic, tourist, civilian and military centers" in this area
should be evacuated.
</P>
<P>
Israeli forces expanded Sunday and for the third time the
targeting enclave, where they launch air raids and bombardments,
in south Lebanon, and ordered in the morning departure of all
residents in towns and villages in the areas of Iglim Al-Toffah,
Nabatiyeh, and south of the Litani river.
</P>
<P>
And a dozen more of villages were added to the targeting zone
in the later afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Some 400,000 southern Lebanese residents have been forced to
leave their homelands and reduced to refugees. In Sour, a
100,000-populated port city in the south, 80,000 have escaped
northward, police sources in the city reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli forces are continuing the air raids and
bombardments on the six successive days since Israel launched the
military operations in Lebanon last Thuraday.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Gaddafi: Libya Ready to Accept International </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TRIPOLI, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi has
said that his country is ready to accept international inspection
on the U.S.-alleged chemical weapons plant, but with certain
conditions.
</P>
<P>
However, Gaddafi did not specify the conditions, but said "when
time comes, we will present the conditions."
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi made the remarks in an interview with a group of
visiting reporters here late Monday night. In the interview, he
denied again that Libya is building an underground plant to
produce chemical weapons inside a mountain at Tarhunah, 65
kilometers southeast of Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
He said that Libya has been accused of manufacturing chemical
weapons for 10 years, but the U.S. has not given sufficient
evidence to prove the allegation.
</P>
<P>
Asked how he would repond if the U.S. uses force against Libya
over the alleged chemical weapons plant, the Libyan leader
said: "We have to defend our country, and the Americans have no
right to do this."
</P>
<P>
"America is not an international police," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi said that what was alleged by the U.S. as the chemical
weapons plant is actually part of an irrigation project called
"man-made river."
</P>
<P>
"We do not need to get permission from the U.S. to do anything
in our land," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, all Arab countries including Libya have the
right to develop nuclear facilities, though his country has not
thought of doing so.
</P>
<P>
"All Arab countries have the right to develop nuclear
facilities because we are under the threat of Israel which has
nuclear weapons," he said. "But we have no capability of doing
that."
</P>
<P>
On the Libya-U.S. relations, Gaddafi said he has tried to
contact U.S. President Bill Clinton, "but the U.S. does not want
to have relations with us."
</P>
<P>
He accused the U.S. of being biased in favor of Israel against
the Arab countries.

<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Russians have been showing great
interest in a book entitled "Deng Xiaoping, My Father", according
to Andrey Milov, who is with the Beijing office of the Russian
Credit Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Russian edition of the book written by Deng Rong, the
youngest daughter of the 91-year-old Chinese leader, was published
in Moscow in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
Milov said proudly that the Russian Credit Bank finally got the
rights to the Russian edition of the book last year after a heated
struggle with several large banks and enterprises, and the book
has been well received by the Russian people.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Deng's name is connected with historic changes in
China, and publication of the book in Russia helped Russians learn
more about Deng's life and the history and realities of China.
</P>
<P>
Since its original publication in Chinese in September 1993,
the book has been translated into Japanese, Korean, Thai, French,
and English, and more than one million copies have been sold.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Succeeds in Reducing Budget Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has succeeded in
reducing its budget deficit from 7.5 percent of GDP in 1993 to an
estimated 5.6 percent in 1995, a UN report said here today.
</P>
<P>
A survey issued here this afternoon by the UN Economic and
Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific said that the reduction
of budget deficit in Pakistan indicated considerable success in
approaching the four percent target.
</P>
<P>
A further reduction to five percent is targeted for 1996, said
the survey.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the rate of monetary expansion in the Pakistani
economy has been quite moderate, it said.
</P>
<P>
The government's reliance on commercial bank borrowings rather
than outright money creation, along with the slow growth of
private-sector credit, has contributed to the success in
containing monetary expansion and reducing budget deficit, it
added.

<HEADLINE> China's Growth Rate Highest in Asia-Pacific: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 16 (Xinhua) -- China's economic growth rate
remained the highest in the Asia-Pacific region in 1995, according
to the United Nations Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the
Pacific 1996.
</P>
<P>
The survey said China's economic growth rate was 10 percent in
1995, as against 11.8 percent the year before.
</P>
<P>
The double-digit growth was achieved despite the austerity
measures implemented since 1994 to counter inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown was mainly due to a tighter monetary policy and
poor agricultural production caused by heavy floods in southern
China and severe drought in the north, which afflicted damage to
crops, infrastructure, property, and even loss of life.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture currently contributes roughly a quarter of China's
national income and its performance continues to have important
implications for income, employment and food supply in the
economy.
</P>
<P>
The fastest-growing sectors in China are the industrial and
services sectors.
</P>
<P>
The rate of industrial growth may come down in 1996, as a
result of policy restraint applied to prevent the economy from
overheating.
</P>
<P>
Inflation remains a major problem facing the Chinese economy.
China has recorded double-digit rates of inflation since 1993,
but strict measures were introduced in 1994 and 1995 to curb price
rises.
</P>
<P>
The high rate of inflation has been driven both by cost and
demand. Cost pressures have amanated from agricultural shortages,
wage rises and the effect of the foreign currency reforms in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The continued high rate of growth in the Chinese economy
exerted a stimulating influence on its neighboring economies
through China's expanding economic linkages with the rest of the
region, said the survey, which was launched here today by
Adrianus Mooy, executive secretary of the United Nations Economic
and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP).
</P>
<P>
As a result, not only China, but also Hong Kong, the Republic
of Korea, and China's Taiwan province are all among the
fastest-growing economies in the ESCAP region and they have
maintained their strong performance during 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
The survey said considerable investment expansion backed by
inward foreign investment both from within and from outside the
region, brisk domestic demand and continued strong export
performance were major sources of economic growth in the expanding
East Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
In all East Asian economies, the survey added, the challenges
of curtailing a further rise in inflation has become a matter of
concern to policy makers.
</P>
<P>
The concern for stability has to be reconciled with the
maintenance of the momentum of more long-term growth, while
meeting domestic imperatives such as the alleviation of poverty
and correction of income disparities.
</P>
<P>
The need to enhance external competitiveness in an increasingly
open world trading environment poses an additional policy
challenge for the East Asian economies.

<HEADLINE> Subsidies Lead to Revenue Loss in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
expected to lose between 8 billion pesos (32 million US dollars)
and 11 billion pesos (44 million dollars) in revenue due to
subsidies provided under the Export Development Act (EDA).
</P>
<P>
The Department of Finance said today that the cost of the EDA
subsidies will offset the expected revenues from the expanded
value added tax.
</P>
<P>
The revenue losses caused by the subsidies will be equivalent
to 0.05 percent of the gross national product (GNP).
</P>
<P>
The estimate was based on actual export growth in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the country's total exports of goods and services
stood at 20.9 billion US dollars, representing a growth of 27
percent over the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Macao Eyes Mainland's Life Insurance Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Macao insurance businessmen are
paying great attention to life insurance market on the Chinese
mainland, and some have established representative offices there.
</P>
<P>
Many of the Macao insurance companies, whose headquarters are
based in Canada, Japan, Portugal, Hong Kong, the United States,
Britain and Australia, are intended to tap the huge market
potential of life insurance business on the Chinese mainland, said
Si Chi Hok, president of the Macao Insurers' Association.
</P>
<P>
The three locally-funded insurance firms are also interested in
opening offices on the mainland market, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Macao's sluggish economy has slowed down the insurance
business," he said, adding that "But many foreign insurance
businesses still want to come to Macao. It is because they expect
a large life insurance market in Macao, and also make Macao a
headpost to tap the huge market potential on the mainland."
</P>
<P>
Macao's 20 insurance firms, including five specially engaged in
life insurance, made a total of 683 million Patacas (about 87.5
million US dollars) by selling insurance policies last year.
</P>
<P>
While non-life insurance business recorded a slower growth
rate, the life insurance business marked an 18th excessive growth
year in 1995. Life insurance income accounted for some 40 percent
of all the insurance income last year.
</P>
<P>
The life insurance in Macao is expected to have a continuous
expansion in the coming years, Si said, because of the following
factors:
</P>
<P>
-- Macao's economy and social structure have undergone great
changes since the early 1980s, and many elderly people have begun
to accept the idea of life insurance. In the past, they thought
it would be an evil omen to buy life insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
-- Macao residents' buying ability has been improved following
the improvement of living standard over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
-- People born in the baby boom of the 1980s in Macao will
begin entering society by the turn of the century to become new
customers of life insurance.
</P>
<P>
Si stressed, however, that in the long run the market potential
of Macao is limited as Macao is a small place and its per capita
insurance income has reached about 200 US dollars. The
competition will become even fiercer.
</P>
<P>
"In the future, when China opens its life insurance market to
full swing, life insurance businesses will shift their attention
from Macao further to the Pearl River Delta and other major cities
on the mainland," he said.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, a large part of the increase in life
insurance income originated from the Pearl River Delta, which
witnessed a fast economic growth over the past 16 years, Si said.
</P>
<P>
He predicts that after China resumes its sovereignty over Macao
in 1999, the existing insurance companies in Macao will make Macao
a headpost to enter the mainland market.

<HEADLINE> Nearly 4,000 Russian Experts Come to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Since 1992, nearly 4,000 Russian
experts have worked in China, mainly in the northeast, and most in
the chemical, oil, and metallurgical industries, medicine and
agriculture, or as translators and teachers, according to the
State Bureau of Foreign Expert Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The northeast part of China borders on Russia, and border trade
is flourishing. Many Russian experts came to Heilongjiang, Jilin,
and Liaoning to help state-owned enterprises there improve their
technology and equipment.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xingzhun, an official with the bureau said that the
Chinese government thanks the Russian experts for their excellent
work, and welcomes more people to help develop friendship and
economic cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the bureau said that China and former Soviet Union
began their exchanges in the 1950s, and at that time a large
number of experts were sent to China to help the country build 156
large or medium-sized enterprises, including the Changchun No.1
Motor Vehicle Plant and the Anshan Steel Works.
</P>
<P>
Those exchanges were suspended from the 1960s to the 1980s
because of the so-called "Cultural Revolution" (1966-76). Since the
early 1990s, the exchange programs have resumed.
</P>
<P>
China will also send technicians to Russia to receive training
in technology and in Russian language to increase technology
exchanges between China and Russia.

Heading a ranking political delegation, Velayati is to discuss
with Pakistani officials promotion of Tehran-Islamabad ties,
ways to upgrade regional cooperation as well as international
and regional issues, including the Afghanistan crisis.
</P>
<P>
Khalid Mahmood, Pakistani Ambassador to Iran, said that he
believed that "the visit will provide opportunity to both
sides for the exchange of views on various issues."
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Afghanistan and Kashmir may be very much
on the agenda for bilateral discussion," he added.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Pakistan occasionally exchanged views on bilateral and
regional issues, particularly on Afghanistan where both countries
are trying to bring the warring parties to the negotiating
table for peace and stability there.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian government supports the Kabul government
while Pakistan backs Taliban. Iranians have consistently attacked
Taliban as Pakistani-and Saudi-backed force trying to topple the
Kabul government.
</P>
<P>
Kabul has been the target of the Taliban's long-range
artillery attacks since last October.
</P>
<P>
The tension led to the trip by Pakistani Premier Benazir
Bhutto to Tehran last November and her talks behind closed doors
with Iran's President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.

SEOUL, April 16 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-sam and U.S. President Bill Clinton today held talks on the
situation on the Korean Peninsula in Cheju, a southern island of
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
In the talks, Kim affirmed that South Korea is willing to meet
without pre-conditions at the governmental level with
representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK).
</P>
<P>
Clinton, for his part, said that the United States is prepared
to play an active and cooperative role in support of this effort.
</P>
<P>
In a joint announcement after the summit today, the two
presidents confirmed the fundamental principle that the
establishment of a stable, permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula
is the task of the Korean people.
</P>

The Clinton-Kim summit came after the DPRK announced on April 4
that it is giving up "control" of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)
separating the DPRK and South Korea because the area has become
too unstable.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived in Cheju early this morning for a nine-hour
visit to South Korea.

Following his visit to South Korea, Clinton will visit Japan

<HEADLINE> Singapore Investor Pulls Out of NZ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A Singaporean company has
diverted its investment of 400 million NZ dollars (268 million US
dollars) from New Zealand to Australia, a local press report said
today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Richard Prebble, leader of the Association of
Consumers and Taxpayers, as saying the company switched the
investment in tourism to Brisbane, Australia, because of the
statements made by leader of the NZ First party Winston Peters.
</P>
<P>
Prebble did not name the company and said he was told by the
Asian investor's NZ partner.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Peters criticized the NZ government for
putting its focus on Asia and for receiving too many Asian
immigrants, which has sparked off heated debates over the
country's immigration policy.
</P>
<P>
The party leader also questioned the loyalty of the Asian
immigrants and the benefits of their investments.
</P>
<P>
However, Peters' statements has angered the government and the
country's Asian communities and even invited criticism from Asian
regions like Hongkong, Taiwan and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Peters has made it clear that his target is the government
immigration policy and assured the immigrants that Asian
investments are safe in NZ and will not be nationalized if his
party comes to power in the coming election.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Currency Hits New Recorded Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's local
currency Rand yesterday hit a new record low of 4.2200/2300
against the Dollar in the financial market, a local daily ''The
Citizen'' reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Rand had lost 16 percent against the Dollar in the last
two months, said the report. The previous low of 4.1900/2000 was
set on April 10.
</P>
<P>
The value of the Rand has been on the decline in the past
several months in a response to the recent developments,
economically and politically, of the country.
</P>
<P>
Wide-spreading rumors about President Nelson Mandela's
ill-health, reactions to the resignation of Finance Minister
Chris Liebenberg and his successor, first black Finance Minister
Trevor Manuel, and Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu
Buthelezi's warning of withdrawal from the government of national
unity all contributed to the decline of the currency.
</P>
<P>
However, dealers here said the Reserve Bank was in the market to
try to smooth volatility and the new black Finance Minister
sought once again to calm the uncertain markets. But neither
action stopped the plunge of the Rand.
</P>
<P>
Manuel told the South Africa International Development Forum
yesterday that he would exercise fiscal discipline in managing the
economy and cooperate closely with the Reserve Bank in a gradual
removal of the remaining foreign exchange controls.

<HEADLINE> Iran Punishes 23 for Election Offenses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Twenty three people were fined,
whipped and imprisoned by Iranian public courts for offenses in
the second round of the election campaign, local press reported
here today.
</P>
<P>
English daily Kayhan International reported that the judiciary
court of Tehran said that several cases of offense were reported
and filed, and consequently, some people were arrested in the past
two days.
</P>
<P>
The public relations office of the court also published the
names of the convicted on charges ranging from using
government vehicles, sticking posters on traffic signs, tearing
election posters of other candidates and replacing them with
their own.
</P>
<P>
Another English daily, Tehran Times, today editorialized on the
run-off elections for the Fifth Parliament scheduled for Friday,
April 19, reminding candidates that they can prepare the ground
for healthy elections by remaining loyal to the ideals of the
Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
The daily stressed that lessons can be learned from the
first round of voting held last month. It called on voters and
candidates not to abuse the public treasury for personal gains,
not to accept donations from big businesses for the electoral
campaign.
</P>
<P>
A candidate who makes empty promises or tries to slander
his rivals is also not bound to honor his commitments and
should not be allowed to enter the house of the people, the
daily added.
</P>
<P>
During the first round of election campaign, about 50
people, including three mayors, were arrested, lashed and fined
for violating election laws.
</P>
<P>
Ali Razini, Chief of Tehran's Justice Department, said that 10
officials of the municipalities, including three borough
mayors in Tehran province, were arrested.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did not identify by names the violators who
broke the election law during the first round of Parliamentary
elections on March 8 this year.

KAMPALA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of voters in Kampala,
Entebbe and Mukono near here will not have a say in who should be
president of Uganda since they failed to pick up their voting
cards before the deadline last night.
</P>
<P>
Many more will also be disenfranchised because they have not
checked if their names are on the electoral register.
</P>
<P>
The facts revealed here today in a survey conducted by the
local daily "The New Vision".
</P>
<P>
The survey said if such failures are widespread throughout
Uganda, hundreds of thousands of eligible voters will not be able
to take part in the elections.
</P>
<P>
There has been poor response from voters to the display of
voters' registers in Kampala, Entebbe and Mukono.
</P>
<P>
With the display deadline which officially closed last night,
many people had not picked their cards or even cross-checked
their names in the last week.

Entebbe Municipality, only 298 people had picked their voters
cards by midday yesterday out of 737 expected voters.

<HEADLINE> Israel Allows Two PNC Members to Enter Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government has
allowed Palestinian National Council (PNC) members Leila Khaled
and Nayef Hawatmeh to enter the Palestinian autonomous areas for
an upcoming meeting of the council, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The permission was given to Khaled, who attempted to hijack an
Israeli airliner in 1970, and Hawatmeh, head of the Democratic
Front for the Liberation of Palestine, without conditions. This
move reversed earlier conditions that they sign a statement
opposing terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) threatened to postpone the PNC meeting if all
its 460 known members are not allowed to participate in its
meeting scheduled for April 22.
</P>
<P>
A second meeting aimed to change and amend the Palestinian
Covenant, which calls for the destruction of Israel, is expected
to be held about a week later but before the May 7 deadline, in
accordance with the Oslo accords between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Both Israeli and the Palestinian official sources agree that
87 members have yet to receive permits, but Israeli officials say
that was due to the fact that the last list of 60 reached them
only on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli sources, the last list includes George
Habash, head of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine
(PFLP), who has said he would not come.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media said that the participation of Khaled and
Hawatmeh in the upcoming PNC meeting indicates that few PNC
members and observers will be barred from entering the Palestinian
areas by Israel.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Syrian-allied PFLP-General
Command under Ahmed Jibril and A-Saiqa have not yet sent lists
of members to the PNA and apparently have no intention to attend,
although they have 30 PNC members.
</P>
<P>
The absence of PNA President Yasser Arafat's opponents from
the meeting will not increase or decrease the chances of his
gaining the required two-third majority for revoking the existing
anti-Israel clauses in the covenant, since an absolute two-third
majority, or 306 votes, is required.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 306 members have already received
authorization to attend, but doubts about permits for others
threatened to reduce participation below the required two-third,
as some participants threatened to stay away in solidarity
with those barred by Israel.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari said here today that Finnish-Chinese trade and economic
cooperation should increase since the two economies complement
each other.
</P>
<P>
He told a forum on Sino-Finnish economic cooperation that
Finland will focus on technology, power generating equipment,
machinery, and telecommunications in its exports to China.
</P>
<P>
Finnish direct investment in China will become more important
for two-way trade, he said, and that more Chinese businesses
should invest in Finland.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that technology-intensive medium-sized and small
businesses should play a more important role in bilateral economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two sides should also increase cooperation in services,
consultation, banking, and especially in environmental protection,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Finnish government firmly supports Finnish-Chinese economic
cooperation and trade and will help China enter the World Trade
Organization, he continued.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo said that there is great
potential in Sino-Finnish cooperation, and the Chinese government
places great importance on bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
China would like to establish long-term stable friendship with
Finland on the basis of equality, mutual benefits, and mutual
respect, he added, noting that China welcomes Finnish investment.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred government officials and businessmen were
present at today's forum, and Finnish businessmen also briefed the
participants on industry in Finland.

<HEADLINE> Planet Named After Singaporean Industrialist of Chinese Origin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- An official with the
International Astronomical Union announced here today that the
International Minor Planet Center under the Union has decided to
name a minor planet that was discovered on November 13, 1980 by
the Purple Mountain Observatory in Nanjing in east China, after a
Singaporean philanthropist of the Chinese origin.
</P>
<P>
"Li Loketai" will be the permanent name for minor planet
No. 3609, according to Zhang Jiaxiang, the official with the
Union. Zhang is also one of three Chinese scientists who
discovered the minor planet.
</P>
<P>
Li Loketai, an industrialist in Singapore, has donated about 60
million Hong Kong dollars over the past decade to education,
poverty reduction, and public welfare projects in China.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Li, who was born in east China's Fujian Province in
1923, donated 10 million yuan (1.2 million US dollars) to
establish a hospital in that province. In 1994, he donated one
million US dollars to the Foundation for Underdeveloped Regions in
China after learning that the number of poverty-stricken people in
China was 80 million.
</P>
<P>
The planet is calculated to be an average 469 million km from
the Sun. It takes 5.54 years for the planet to make one revolution
around the Sun.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Take-away Trade Boosts Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese food has become a real
take-away business for the country. Shipments of food from China
earned an appetizing 12 billion US dollars in the past year --
accounting for nearly ten percent of the country's export trade.
</P>
<P>
Chinese officials have helped food-export companies to improve
their hygienic quality to meet tougher demands of the
international market.
</P>
<P>
The efforts have paid off with 2,100 more Chinese food-export
companies registered in foreign countries in the 1993-95 period,
said the State Administration for the Inspection of Import and
Export Commodities. Seven more countries in the world have
permitted Chinese food products to enter their markets.
</P>
<P>
Most of the countries in the world now make stringent checks on
the hygienic quality of food companies before approving their
registrations.
</P>
<P>
The improvement of hygienic quality of the food companies
promoted the development of food export in the country, the
administration noted.

<P>
JERUSALEM, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Visiting French Foreign
Minister Herve de Charette said here Monday night that the
solution to the current Lebanese Crisis can only be diplomatic,
not military.
</P>
<P>
Charette, who made the remarks following his meeting with Prime
 Minister Shimon Peres, arrived in Israel Monday afternoon on his
trouble-shooting mission in the Middle East. He is expected to
leave here for consultations with Lebanese and Syrian leaders
later today.
</P>
<P>
France and the EU have spoken out in favor of maintaining
normal ties with Iran against U.S. and Israeli wishes so
as to persuade the Iranian authorities to rein in Hezbollah
who receives substantial support from Tehran.
</P>

The minister said his country will coordinate its steps
with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that "it is too early to imagine what can
be possible to bring the crisis to an end." However, he
said he would like to "emphasize urgency to find a rapid
solution."
</P>

France maintain special relations with Lebanon due to historic
background. Earlier this month President Jacques Chirac visited
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
After Israel launched Operation Grapes of Wrath on April
11, Chirac complained to Peres that Israel's response had been
out of proportion to the Hezbollah attacks.

<HEADLINE> China to Establish Rural Energy Enterprise Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- China has plans to build dozens
of rural energy enterprise groups with about 100 million yuan in
the registered capital of each of them.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Jingming of the Ministry of Agriculture, the
efforts are mainly aimed at developing methane gas projects,
energy-saving products, and solar-energy industry.
</P>
<P>
A solar-energy group is likely to be set up this year, Li said,
explaining that all of this is intended to improve the structure
of rural energy utilization.
</P>
<P>
The major source of energy in China's rural areas is biological
fuel, such as straw and woods. Half of the straw and one-third of
the wood used in China is burned as fuel, causing damage to the
environment.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the establishment of enterprise groups will help
increase the output of China's rural energy enterprises and their
competitiveness in the international market.
</P>
<P>
He said that the technology in China's rural energy industry is
advanced, but the small scale and scattered operations put the
industry far behind the rest of the world. "We often lose out in
the international market."
</P>
<P>
Jing Yanjun, who has a factory in northern China's Henan
Province that produces charcoal from waste materials such as rice
husks, tree leaves, bark, and stalks, is an enthusiastic supporter
of the idea. "My factory is small and short of
investment. Although we have a good market locally, we have
limited potential," he said, noting that building enterprise
groups will help his factory in fund raising, marketing, and
technology upgrading.
</P>
<P>
The rural energy industry has developed rapidly in the past
several years. Statistics show that by the end of 1995, the
country had more than 5,000 companies in that area, with annual
business worth more than two billion yuan.

DAR ES SAalaam, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar President Salmin
Amour stressed the need to value and recognize African old
culture so as to enable future generations to know their roots.
</P>
<P>
The president made the statement while opening a five-day
international symposium on Arab and oriental influences on
African traditional music and dances held in Zanzibar on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Salmin Amour said modern styles of civilisation should not
make Africans to lose their inherited culture and roots. "The
modern culture should not be allowed to overshadow the old
culture in the society," he said.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that music and dance will be used to address
problems hindering a country's social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
The symposium, which was organised by the Zanzibar Ministry of
Culture in collaboration with other foreign institutions, is
aimed at giving culture experts a chance to exchange ideas on how
to promote traditional music and dances in Africa.

<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior Uruguayan businessman
today called for alarm on trade protectionism among Ibero-American
countries.
</P>
<P>
Alfonso Varela, president of Uruguay's Nation Chamber of
Commerce, told his colleagues from 20 countries that integration
has brought about an increase in world trade.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, several Ibero-American Association of
Chambers of Commerce (AICO) member states are applying protective
measures of tariff and non-tariff barriers.
</P>
<P>
These measures, he said, impede "the distribution of our
products" and therefore are harmful to trade.
</P>
<P>
His remarks were made on the first day of the 25th meeting
of AICO's Board of Directors at this Uruguayan capital.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting was to discuss issues of regional
integration, world trade tendencies and challenges that were
brought about by integration.
</P>
<P>
AICO represents more than 400 business associations in 22
Ibero-American countries, including Spain and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
AICO's two objectives are to study economic activity and
international trade, and to promote business development in the
private sector.

<HEADLINE> Australian Housing Industry Picking Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- More Australians were buying new
houses in February, prompting the local housing industry to
foresee an optimistic outlook in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The volume of housing finance rose 2.9 percent seasonally
adjusted to 40,634 units in February from 38,482 units in January,
the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) announced today.
</P>
<P>
The ABS figures showed that the number of loans made to people
who built new houses increased 5 percent in the month, much higher
than the increase of 2.8 percent in the number of loans for
purchasing established dwellings.
</P>
<P>
The Housing Industry Association (HIA) expected that the
housing market would start to climb up from its trough in June,
because housing finance figures always lead construction
commencement figures by three months.
</P>
<P>
The Australian housing industry plunged after reaching an all
time high in 1993-94. It has been in the doldrums since late 1994
when the Reserve Bank of Australian (RBA) raised interest rates.
</P>
<P>
ABS figures showed that the housing industry had been growing
in the three consecutive months to February, boosting the hopes
that the industry has hit the bottom and begun to rally.
</P>
<P>
However, local economists said that the housing market was
still weak.
</P>
<P>
"The pattern over time and across the states continues to be
unstable, making it too early to predict future directions with
certainty," said Phillip Bushby, president of the Real Estate
Institute of Australia (REIA).
</P>
<P>
Today's housing finance figures proved that RBA was right in
its decision not to lower interest rates by the end of last year.
But an expected lower growth rate of the economy and employment in
the latter half of the year would possibly dampen the outlook of
the housing industry.

<HEADLINE> Farmer Seed Expert in Shaanxi (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 16 (Xinhua Correspondent Bian Jiang) -- In the
space of 10 years, a rural woman has gone from being a commoner to
a vegetable seed expert and manager of a gardening company, which
has an annual turnover of more than one million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The woman is He Xiuqin, a farmer from Shaanxi Province's
Shennong Township, in Baoji city, the legendary hometown of the
mythical ruler Shennong (Holy Farmer), who is said to have been
the founder of farming in China.
</P>
<P>
"It seems that I was born with an unbreakable bond with seeds,"
she noted.
</P>
<P>
She came to the village she now calls home as a bride in 1968,
when she was assigned to be the village's agricultural technician,
specializing in seed breeding and increasing the use of
agro-technology.
</P>
<P>
Rural reforms created more opportunities for farmers to make a
better living in the early 1980's. At that time, although the seed
business was not what she wanted to do, her 12-year work
experience would pave the way for her success in the seed business
later.
</P>
<P>
First, however, she ran a restaurant, made clothes, and planted
mushrooms, becoming a member of the first group of local residents
to save as much as 10,000 yuan ($1,205).
</P>
<P>
When the contract system, based on individual initiative, was
introduced to her village in 1984, she was often consulted by
vegetable growers, who trusted her "technical background" and
invited her to serve as their "senior advisor" in choosing
vegetable seeds.
</P>
<P>
The urgent need for help and encouragement of her fellow
villagers prompted her to shift her focus to the seed business.
</P>
<P>
With the support of her family, in June of 1986 she took all
her savings to invest in a private vegetable seed center for sales
and technical advice, the first of its kind in Baoji.
</P>
<P>
In order to make people more aware of the center's existence
and to disseminate information about improved vegetable strains,
she often visited farmers by going from village to village,
household to household, and down to the fields with a bag of
seeds, introducing new strains she had bred.
</P>
<P>
She knows from first-hand experience that "good seeds promise a
good harvest," and sees to it that her center does not sell seeds
that have not passed quarantine tests, no matter how much it might
cost her.
</P>
<P>
She also guarantees that she will compensate clients for any
losses incurred by problems they have with her seeds, and makes
certain that the sales are accompanied by sufficient technical
instructions.

She often travels to fields to help with sowing or to provide
technical information or details for peasant farmers who order her
seeds by mail. Many of her clients have in turn become technicians
in their own villages.
</P>

Over the past decade, He Xiuqin has sold 200,000 kilograms of

was developed to ensure vegetable supplies for urbanites.
</P>
<P>
As a result of this, she has been given the title of "national
woman pacesetter." Her fellow villagers and farmer clients simply
call her "Sister Seed", however, a nickname she likes very much.
</P>
<P>
But, with only a high school education and rudimentary
technical knowledge, "Sister Seed" never quite felt that her
knowledge was adequate for ensuring the quality she was after and
for technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
So, in 1987, she attended China Correspondence University for
Promoting the Use of Agro-Techniques, and two years later,
graduated as a top student. Then in 1990, she passed a state
examination and was recognized officially as an agronomist, and in
1993, was chosen by the Baoji City government to study in Japan
for one year as an agriculture researcher.
</P>
<P>
"In order to be able to adapt to the foreign environment
quickly, I spent eight months learning Japanese at my own expense
before I went abroad," she recalls.
</P>
<P>
He is in her forties, and is still full of energy and
ambition. She recently set up the Baoji Evergreen Agricultural
Development Company with Japanese investment of 6.68 million yuan
(about $800,000), the first "vegetable basket project" involving
foreign investment in Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The company will not only be developing new agricultural
products and gardening techniques in China, but also be involved
in the import and export business.
</P>
<P>
Some people attribute He Xiuqin' success to her intelligence
and hard work, but she has her own explanation: "I was just lucky
enough to live in the era of reforms and opening up, and at a time
when importance is being attached to developing agriculture
through the use of science and technology."

<HEADLINE> Metals Are a Real Gold Mine for Hunan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Rich reserves of nonferrous
metals have greatly increased the revenues of south China's Hunan
Province.
</P>
<P>
Exports of the province's top ten nonferrous metals are
generating 200 million US dollars worth of income every year.
</P>
<P>
The area has achieved fruitful results in the metals industry,
thanks to more efforts in adjusting its industrial structure.
</P>
<P>
Hunan has more than 11 million tons of reserves of copper,
lead, zinc, nickel, aluminum, magnesium, titanium, antimony, tin,
and mercury.
</P>
<P>
In addition to two billion yuan spent on the technological
upgrading of enterprises, more effort has been exerted to optimize
the way enterprises are organized, which has helped the province
add 69 percent of smelting, and 111 percent of processing capacity.
</P>
<P>
During the past 10 years, the province scored many scientific
research achievements, 85 of which were applied to production.
</P>
<P>
It has developed more than 100 fine and deeply-processed
nonferrous metals products during the recent years, 34 of which
are name-branded in China.
</P>
<P>
Fine and deeply-processed products have accounted for nine
percent of the total local nonferrous metal products. More than 50
local nonferrous metal products have been exported to more than 30
countries and regions in America, Europe, and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Zhuzhou Smelting Plant has become nation's biggest base for
lead and zinc exports, and the Zhuzhou Hardmetal Plant is one of
the world's five largest of its kind.

BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and foreign investors are
putting money into the silk screen printing industry as demand for
the products is growing in the country.

The capital city has seen about one thousand enterprises

These account for only a minor part of the country's
total. There are more in the south than in the north.

A local observer noted that the market is showing good demand
for silk screen products, and the technology has been applied to
advertisements, textiles, electronics, and ceramics.
</P>
<P>
However, advanced technology from outside is still needed to
improve equipment to satisfy customer demand for high-quality

<HEADLINE> Peru Resumes Talks With IMF to Acquire New Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Peruvian Government and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) resumed talks this week to make
Peru eligible for new IMF loans, according to a source close to
the Economy and Finance Ministry today.
</P>
<P>
The loan talks are made of two rounds, the first held in
Washington and the second will be in Lima.
</P>
<P>
The source said Peruvian and IMF officials are now working on
draft guidelines to prepare Peru's finance in the next three years
for meeting the IMF criteria for new loans.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines, to be contained in a letter of intent for 1996,
will be ready on Wednesday, the source noted.
</P>
<P>
To receive new funding from IMF, the Peruvian Government has to
balance its budget within a certain time frame. The talks right
now, the source said, are concentrated on how deep the government
could cut into its 1996 budget.
</P>
<P>
To increase its revenues, the Peruvian Government has also
reportedly agreed to hike gasoline prices by five percent as a
complementary means.
</P>
<P>
The eligibility for IMF's loans is also a pre-condition for the
Paris Club of private creditors, who own one-third of Peru's
foreign debts, to reschedule the country's debt payments between
1996 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
For that reason, IMF wants to see, in addition to a low
inflation rate, a positive growth in Peru's gross domestic product
(GDP), a balanced foreign trade account and a balanced state
budget.
</P>
<P>
IMF officials require that the Peruvian Government is committed
to achieving a primary fiscal surplus equal to 2.5 percent of the
country's GDP.

<HEADLINE> Indian Industrialists Oppose 100 Percent MNC Stake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Top industrialists in the
Confederation of Industry of India (CII) have categorically ruled
out the entry of multinational companies (MNC) with 100 percent
ownership.
</P>
<P>
Some of the industrialists have advocated selective entry of
multinationals into the country, CII sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Multinational companies in India have preferred 100 percent
stake in the units to joint ventures with their Indian partners.
The Indian government has accepted some of their demands.
</P>
<P>
A general consensus emerged that 100 percent foreign ownership
should not be given in all the sectors to international companies
entering India, the same sources said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no need to recklessly give 100 percent ownership to
foreign companies," said Parvinder Singh, chairman and managing
director of Ranbaxy Company.
</P>
<P>
It was important to retain revenues generated from ventures in
India. It would not be judicious to allow companies to repatriate
all their dividends, said Dhruv Sawhney, chairman and managing
director of Triveni Engineering.

<HEADLINE> FAO Official Expresses Concern Over Global Ban Of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 16 (Xinhua0 -- The representative of the Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in Nairobi has expressed
concern over the global ban of Methyl Bromide, saying the ban
might adversely affect Africa's food security and horticulture
production.
</P>
<P>
Horold Norton told a seminar on the Larger Grain Borer here on
Monday that Methyl Bromide is crucial for the protection of
stored foods, especially grains in Africa, the Middle East and
South Asia.
</P>
<P>
The FAO representative was reacting to the Montreal Protocol
on the Ozone Layer last May, which calls for the banning of Methyl
Bromide and other chemicals harmful to the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that huge losses in production and quality and
depletion of food resources will result in higher food prices and
further shortages, if no alternative is found.
</P>
<P>
Export of non-food products vulnerable to exotic pests will
also be affected,he said.
</P>
<P>
While urging the workshop to address strategies to fight
pests, Horold Norton said Africa faces major problems from pests
which adversely affected food production and reduced the
continent's capacity to reach food self-sufficiency.

<HEADLINE> Economic Growth in Asia-Pacific Remains Strong: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Economic performance in the Asia-
 Pacific region in 1995 was striking and average rates of growth
in output and trade were far above the world average, according to
an annual UN survey released here today.
</P>
<P>
The rate of economic growth in the developing countries in the
region covered by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia
and the Pacific (ESCAP) in 1995 averaged 7.8 percent as against a
world average of 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 figure for the region was slightly lower than the
8-percent growth rate achieved in 1994, said the Economic and
Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific 1996, which was released at
a press briefing by ESCAP Executive Secretary Adrianus Mooy.
</P>
<P>
The survey projects a further deceleration of the growth rate
to 7.4 percent in 1996 and 7.2 percent in 1997, while world
average rates of growth are projected to rise to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in the region reflects policy restraints in some
of the fast-growing economies to prevent them from being
overheated in the face of constraints such as labor and skill
shortages and infrastructural bottlenecks.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 Survey also reviewed the macroeconomics and trade and
balance of payments performance and related policies of economies
of the ESCAP region for the most recent period.
</P>
<P>
A critical factor for the continuance of today's favorable
trends will be the sustained commitment of countries in the region
to domestic policy reforms, said the survey.
</P>
<P>
These include enhancing the role of the private sector in
development, strengthening legal frameworks, macroeconomic reform
and institutional mechanisms for collaboration between government
and the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The survey points out that while energizing the private sector,
countries in the region continue to emphasize the vital role of
the public sector in the provision of social services.
</P>
<P>
In most countries, the proportion of public expenditure
allocated to social sectors has exceeded 20 percent. Considerable
improvements have been made in education, health, water supply and
sanitation over the past decade, the survey noted.
</P>
<P>
It said, however, while the region is playing a dynamic role in
an increasingly globalized world economy, there are also several
areas calling for even greater attention.
</P>
<P>
These relate, among others, to equity between income classes,
regions and genders, said the ESCAP survey, adding that they
include cost-effectiveness in delivery and intrasectoral
priorities.
</P>
<P>
The survey stressed improvements in the quality of services and
called for closer involvement of the private sector,
non-governmental organizations and local communities. Greater
mobilization of resources for the social sectors will also be
essential, said the survey.
</P>
<P>
It reminded policy makers in the region that the remarkable
progress of the region has not benefited all its countries and
peoples, many of whom remain among the world's least developed and
poorest.
</P>
<P>
The survey also examined other important issues in the region,
such as property rights, enforcement of contracts and policies to
enhance competition.
</P>
<P>
The survey was released prior to the 52nd ESCAP Commission
Session, scheduled for April 17-24 in Bangkok and expected to
discuss vital issues concerning the region's future.
</P>
<P>
The issues will include strategies to combat the "poverty
amidst plenty" dilemma that threatens to cloud an otherwise rosy
economic picture for the region.
</P>
<P>
The ESCAP covers 49 member economics and 10 associate members
in the Asia-Pacific region.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Militia Pushes Back Afghan Government Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Taliban militia
had pushed back government troops in the strategic Herat province
in the western part of the country, reports coming from Herat said
today.
</P>
<P>
Herat Governor Maulvi Yar Mohammad was quoted as saying that
Taliban had launched a four-pronged counter-offensive against the
government troops who penetrated into Herat province in the past
several days.
</P>
<P>
"Taliban fighters killed ten enemy soldiers and captured 25 in
Monday's fighting," Mohammad said, adding that troops loyal to
current President Burhanuddin Rabbani abandoned their positions,
retreating towards Ghor province.
</P>
<P>
Afghan government troops unleashed an offensive against Taliban
in western Afghanistan last Friday, in a bid to retake Herat city,
capital of Herat province and a strategic point.
</P>
<P>
Herat fell to Taliban's hand last September and the then
pro-Rabbani Herat Governor Ismael Khan escaped into Iran for
refuge.
</P>
<P>
Some reports said that former Herat Deputy Governor Allauddin
Khan had sneaked into Ghor province from Iran and gathered a
number of fighters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taliban fighters were reported preparing for attack
on Ghor province.
</P>
<P>
A senior Taliban leader Maulvi Ehsanullah was quoted as saying
that Taliban jets had bombed Chaghcharan, capital of Ghor
province, and inflicted heavy losses on the enemy.

<HEADLINE> Australia Remains Totally Committed to APEC: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The new coalition federal
government of Australia remained totally committed to APEC, last
week's appointment of an Ambassador for APEC was proof of the
government's commitment, Trade Minister Tim Fischer said here
today.
</P>
<P>
"Success of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) relies
on it maintaining its momentum, we will be pushing on with that,"
Fischer said in an interview conducted by the Australian
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Australia was reported to have an interim APEC action plan
ready by next month detailing how it would achieve the goal of
free trade by 2010, as the 18-member APEC forum agreed last year
to present drafts of their interim action plans by May, with the
final interim plan ready for the annual informal meeting of APEC
leaders in Manila.
</P>
<P>
"Singapore and Hong Kong have already put down their plans, now
we're developing ours," he said, adding that Australia would seek
to maintain the momentum of APEC's push toward its free trade
goal, which was agreed at the APEC leaders informal meeting held
in Bogor, Indonesia, 1994.
</P>
<P>
Under that deal, APEC's developed members like the United
States, Japan and Australia will open their markets to free flow
of goods from other APEC members by 2010. The developing members
were given an additional 10 years to achieve the target.
</P>
<P>
Next week, Fischer is going to visit the Philippines, which
will host the annual APEC meeting scheduled in December, for talks
with President Ramos and other foreign, trade and agriculture
ministers.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 16 (Xinhua) -- India's Samata Party has
promised to reduce social tensions in the country if it wins the
general elections in late April and May.
</P>
<P>
In its election manifesto released late last night, the party
called for a balanced approach to reduce social tensions through
generating more jobs.
</P>
<P>
The Samata Party said it stood for decentralization of the
political and economic powers.
</P>
<P>
The party "will be guided by people's nationalism and
secularism so that the people of India can rightfully enjoy the
plurality of Indian culture, respect and protect the identity and
genius of all religious, linguistic and ethnic groups and unit
them for common aspirations," said the manifesto.
</P>
<P>
It said the party, if voted to power, would increase the
allocation for agriculture to 50 percent of the plan outlay until
the infrastructure and social services are strengthened.

<HEADLINE> Agreement Reached on U.S. Counter-Terrorism Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Congressional leaders
said today agreement has been reached on a counter-terrorism bill
that gives the federal government more power to fight terrorism
and limits appeals by death-row inmates.
</P>
<P>
The House and Senate are expected to give final approval to the
bill this week to get it ready for President Bill Clinton to sign
by Friday, the first anniversary of the bombing of the Oklahoma
City federal building that killed 168 people.
</P>
<P>
The legislation was a compromise between a bill passed last
year by the Senate and a version passed last month by the House of
Representatives which eliminated key provisions making it easier
for federal agents to identify and wiretap suspected terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, a Republican
from Utah, said the bill "adds important tools to the government's
fight against terrorism and does so in a temperate manner that is
protective of civil liberties."
</P>
<P>
The compromise bill, worked out by House-Senate negotiators,
includes a ban on fund raising in the United States by
terrorist-linked organizations and expedited procedures for
deporting aliens convicted of felonies.
</P>
<P>
It allows courts, for national security reasons, to deport
suspected terrorists using classified evidence not disclosed to
the alien, and provides 1 billion dollars over four years for
federal and state efforts to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The bill requires markers on plastic explosives to help
identify bombers, but asks for only a study of the need for
markers on powder or chemicals such as the fertilizer used to make
the Oklahoma City bomb.
</P>
<P>
Under a death penalty appeal provision, prisoners would have
only one year after their state court appeals are exhausted to
file federal appeals, and the subject matter would be limited. In
most cases, death sentences would be carried out within two years
of final state court action.

BUENOS AIRES, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A bomb exploded today in a

Party, causing property damage but no casualties.
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson for the municipality of Merlo, in the province

Last week, security forces deactivated an explosive device left
in the garden of the Naval Hospital in this capital city.
</P>
<P>
Several institutions, airports, schools and military facilities
have received telephone call warnings in the past few days that
they are targeted for attacks.
</P>
<P>
A group called "Revolutionary Organization of the People" has

In the wake of the bomb threats, President Carlos Menem ruled
out on April 12 the possibility of imposing a state of siege in

But according to statistics from the State Investigation

DHAKA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi President Abdur Rahman
Biswas appointed two election commissioners in the current process
of recasting the Election Commission (EC) to ensure a free and
fair parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
According to an announcement published here today, the two
commissioners appointed Monday are former secretary Abidur Rahman

likely to take oath of office today, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Following the dissolution of the 6th parliament and the

former opposition parties demanded for reorganization of the EC,
under which the former ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)
held the 6th parliamentary elections despite all opposition
parties' boycott.

The former Chief Election Commissioner (CEC), justice A. K. M.
Sadeque, and an election commissioner, justice Abdul Jalil,
resigned on April 6 and 9. The new CEC Mohammad Abu Hena was

<HEADLINE> Mexico to Maintain Floating Exchange Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Mexico will keep its floating
exchange rate in a bid to reduce inflation, Central Bank governor
Miguel Mancera said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of the Mexican Stock Exchange, Miguel
Mancera rejected the idea of a fixed exchange rate, but he
admitted the floating exchange rate also produces diverse problems.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that monetary policy should aim at lowering
inflation, stabilizing the purchasing power of the national
currency and contributing more effectively to economic development.
</P>
<P>
On the prospect of inflation, the Banco de Mexico official
predicted that the inflation rate in April will not be as high as
mentioned in many forecasts.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, according to the information available at the Banco
de Mexico, the monthly inflation rate is estimated at 2.8 percent
for this month and less than 2 percent for May and subsequent
months," said Miguel Mancera.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the business community in Mexico has a more
pessimistic view about inflation, warning of a strong rebound in
inflation.
</P>
<P>
The rate of inflation predicted last week by German Gonzalez,
president of the Confederation of National Chambers of Commerce,
was higher than Mancera's figure.
</P>
<P>
According to another analysis prepared by independent
institutions such as the Federal Consumer Protection Bureau and
Economists and Partners Group, the country's annual inflation will
reach 35 percent or more at the end of 1996 and that the official
target of 20.5 percent "was set too low".

<HEADLINE> Peru, Chile Agree to Resume Talks on Border Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian Foreign Minister Francisco
Tudela and his Chilean counterpart Jose Miguel Insulza agreed
today to resume talks on settling a remaining border issue.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued by the Peruvian Foreign
Ministry, the talks will lead to the turning over of the
facilities built by Chile in the city of Arica.
</P>
<P>
The decision to resume the talks was made by Peruvian and
Chilean officials in Cochabamba, Bolivia, while attending the
on-goning 6th meeting of European Union-Rio Group foreign
ministers.
</P>
<P>
Arica, a coastal city on the western tip of the border between
the two neighboring Latin American countries, was taken over by
Chile in a war more than a century ago.
</P>
<P>
Over years, Chile has built a port, a customs service station,
a railway station and other facilities there.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the city has been run jointly by the two
countries while a series of new agreements, known as Lima
Conventions, have been in the making for a gradual returning of
the city, and the facilities as well, to Peru's control.
</P>
<P>
However, while the documents have already been approved by
legislative bodies in Chile, they are yet to be submitted to the
congress in Peru.
</P>
<P>
In their talks today, the Peruvian and Chilean foreign
ministers made a "thorough analysis" of the reasons for which the
agreement was not ratified.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to push forward for the creation of a better
atmosphere for bilateral economic and trade cooperation, the
Peruvian Foreign Ministry press release said.
</P>
<P>
Special attention will be given to an agreement on reciprocal
protection and promotion of investments, the release said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Herb Provides New Hope for Senile Dementia Sufferers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A new herbal medicine for the
ageing-disease, senile dementia, has been developed by the
Shanghai-based pharmaceuticals institute of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Next to cancer, heart diseases and strokes, senile dementia is
the fourth biggest killer for old people. It usually attacks
people in their sixties, and its incidence rises as people grow
older.
</P>
<P>
There are currently an estimated 25 million sufferers of senile
dementia in the world. The search to find a new medicine for the
disease has become - literally - a race against time for
scientists all over the world.
</P>
<P>
The active ingredient for the new medicine was abstracted from
a herbal medicine in Zhejiang Province. The herbal medicine has a
special pharmacological action, which was proved effective in
senile dementia.
</P>
<P>
The clinical application of the medicine by hospitals in
Shanghai, Hangzhou, Suzhou and Shandong shows that the medicine,
more effective than the other medicines, is ideal for senile
dementia treatment.
</P>
<P>
The medicine has already been approved by the Ministry of
Public Health and will soon appear on the market.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan, an
agricultural giant, has halted much of the encroachment on
farmland in the province.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 50,000 hactares of land were saved from construction

<HEADLINE> Colombian Police Seize Key Data of Drug Cartel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Colombian police said
today they had seized key documents from a drug cartel in weekend
raids but the cartel's boss was still on the run.
</P>
<P>
Documents found in raids in the southwestern department of El
Cauca that will enable police to complete the organizational chart
of the cartel run by Justo Pastor Perafan and identify companies
owned by him, said General Luis Enrique Montenegro Rinco, deputy
director of the police and commander of an anti-drug task force.
</P>
<P>
Perafan, 50, is said to be the leader of drug cartels in
Cauca and Santa Fe de Bogota. The federal prosecutor issued a
arrest warrant for him early February.
</P>
<P>
Police also plan to search at least 20 companies in Perafan's
business empire in Santa Fe de Bogota and in his hometown Rosas
Del Cauca, said Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
The "El Tiempo" newspaper said today that Perafan, if arrested,
could finger political leaders financed by drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
President Ernesto Samper is currently embroiled in a political
scandal after his campaign director accused him of taking money
from the Cali drug cartel. Samper has denied the charge.

<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations regional
conference opened here today to deal with the grave social crisis
in Latin America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
The five-day meeting was aimed to help revise the economic
measures adopted by countries in the region and offer solutions to
the problems they face.
</P>
<P>
Gert Rosental, secretary-general of the United Nations Economic
Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (CEPAL), said at
the opening session that there are few options to the macro trends
of the world economy such as trade liberalization, privatization
and search for macro-economic balances.
</P>
<P>
The emphasis, he said, should be placed on pursuing reforms at
the micro-economic, business and personal levels.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo pointed out that
the CEPAL, which has played a decisive role in preparing
development proposals for the region since 1960s, should be
further strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting was attended by foreign ministers and business
representatives from across the region.

<HEADLINE> European Bank Approves Capital Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Bank of Reconstruction
and Development (EBRD) approved a capital increase of 10 billion
ECU (13 billion U.S. dollars) at its fifth annual meeting here on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 59 EBRD member countries and institutions unanimously
agreed to double the bank's capital from the current 10 billion
ECU (13 billion dollars) to 20 billion ECU (26 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
In an opening speech at the two-day meeting, which started
Monday, EBRD President Jacques de Larosiere said there must be
some "positive changes" now to let people feel the benefit.
</P>
<P>
The coming years are crucial for central Europe and eastern
Europe, he said, adding that the region's stability is of top
priority for Europe and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Larosiere said the bank targets to increase its regular loans
to an annual 2.5 billion ECU (3.25 billion dollars) in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the EBRD approved 134 projects worth 2.86 billion
ECU (3.72 billion dollars), with net profit reaching 7.5 million
ECU (9.75 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
As host of the meeting, Bulgarian Prime Minister Zhan Videnov
said in an opening address that Bulgaria supports the increase of
EBRD's capital, adding that it will provide investment guarantee
for the reform of Bulgaria and other central and east European
countries.
</P>
<P>
Videnov welcomed the EBRD's decision to set up a
45-million-dollar post-privatization fund in Bulgaria and its
decision to stabilize large banks which invest in some private
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The EBRD was set up in 1991 to help private industry in the
central and east European countries.
</P>
<P>
Shareholders of the bank include 57 countries and two
institutions -- the European Union and the European Investment
Bank.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, the bank has committed funds to 368
projects worth 7.85 billion ECU (10.2 billion dollars).

LIMA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez
de Lozada inaugurated today the 6th meeting of foreign ministers
of the Rio Group and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Lozada said that one of the greatest
tragedies of Latin America is that its biggest exports are drugs
and poverty.
</P>
<P>
He called on countries in the region to increase trade and
investment as a way to address the two problems.
</P>
<P>
Lozada also said that he was saddened by the fact that
conflicts still exist among "Latin American brothers", whom he
urged to show "generosity and imagination" to settle their
disputes.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from Italy, Spain, Ireland and Greece are
attending the meeting, while the other states of the 15-member
European Union are represented by ministers of other portfolios or
lower-ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
All the foreign ministers from the Rio Group countries except
Colombia and Panama are attending the meeting in the central
Bolivian city of Cochabamba.

<HEADLINE> Billions Spent on Panama Canal Since 1979 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Panama Canal Commission
has invested more than 2.3 billion U.S. dollars in the trans-ocean
canal since 1979.
</P>
<P>
The money, according to a member of the commission at its
weekly meeting today, was spent to guarantee the canal's long-term
viability.
</P>
<P>
Rodolfo Sabonge said the commission attached special importance
to the maintenance and improvement of the canal, which the United
States will turn over to Panama before the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
He said more and more Panamanians are participating in the
canal's hand-over process, as is shown by the fact that 90 percent
of the Canal Commission's personnel is Panamanian.
</P>
<P>
Sabonge added that the commission will hire a consulting firm
to study its legal structure, following the recent signing of a
bill by U.S. President Bill Clinton that changed its status from a
government corporation to a U.S. federal entity.
</P>
<P>
The bill enables the Canal Commission to make recommendations
to the U.S. Congress and facilitates its transition to a more
autonomous entity after 1999, said Sabonge.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1977 Torrijos-Carter Canal Treaty, the United States
will turn over the administration of the canal to Panama no later
than the last day of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, which became effective on October 1, 1979, created
the Panama Canal Commission as a U.S. federal entity headed by a
Panamanian administrator.

<HEADLINE> Poorest Nations See Economic Growth in 1995: UNCTAD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Economies of the least developed
countries have made modest progress from 1994 to 1995 after years
of stagnation and decline, with estimated real GDP growth
averaging over three percent, said an annual report issued Tuesday
by UNCTAD.
</P>
<P>
According to the Least Developed Countries 1996 Report by the
U.N. Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), least developed
African countries are estimated to have attained average GDP
growth of 2.2 percent in 1995, while their Asian counterparts
recorded estimated growth of 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations currently classifies 48 countries as least
developed, among which 33 are African countries.
</P>
<P>
The UNCTAD report attributes the acceleration of growth in
African poorest countries largely to the improved commodity
prices. In some countries it is also due to the enhanced political
and social stability and domestic economic policy reforms.
</P>
<P>
Despite the expected weakening of commodity prices, UNCTAD
foresaw that economic growth in the least developed countries as a
whole should be sustained in 1996 at last year's level.
</P>
<P>
Although economic performance has been improved by the poorest
countries in recent years, "it is still far from being the cause
for optimism," said Carlos Fortin, deputy secretary general of
UNCTAD.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it has been widely recognized that most of the
poorest countries have become increasingly marginalized by
globalization and liberalization which are now the main theme of
the world economy.
</P>
<P>
The UNCTAD report noted that the Uruguay Round multilateral
trade agreements may impose transitional costs on poorest
countries through a number of channels such as erosion of tariff
preferences in their export markets, and higher food import prices.
</P>
<P>
The poorest nations also seem to be at risk of marginalization
with regard to official development assistance (ODA), UNCTAD said.
</P>
<P>
The share of aid to the poorest countries in the total ODA
program of the OECD (Organization for Economic and Cooperation and
Development) countries has fallen from 27 percent a decade ago to
23 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
ODA to the poorest countries as share of OECD countries' GNP
has declined from 0.09 percent in 1990 to 0.07 percent in 1994,
according to UNCTAD.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. trade and development agency argued that current
fiscal constraints in donor countries need not necessarily lead to
a drop of aid flows to the poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
"With even modest increases in the funding of multilateral aid
programs and priority allocations to the least developed countries
within bilateral aid, it should be possible to meet the aid
targets set for these countries," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report also called for bolder international action to
reduce poorest countries' external debt, which amounted to 73
percent of their combined GDP in 1994.
</P>
<P>
On the least developed countries themselves, the report said
maintaining macroeconomic stability, adopting outward-oriented
trade policies and avoiding excessive distortions in markets would
be crucial policy requirement for them.
</P>
<P>
It also urged these countries to strengthen the export sectors,
rehabilitate and expand infrastructure, enhance human resource
development and improve agricultural technology.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report also stressed that the adjustment efforts
by the poorest countries require more financial and technical
support from the international community.
</P>
<P>
The international community must help ensure that the market
access of the least developed countries is not undermined by
protectionism and the growth of regional trade arrangements, the
report added.

<HEADLINE> No Obstacle to Closer Sino-Armenian Ties: Qian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YEREVAN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen
said here today that there are no conflicts of interests between
China and Armenia and no obstacle in the way of their relations.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who arrived here today for a one-day visit, made the
remarks when holding talks with his Armenian counterpart, Vagan
Papazyan.
</P>
<P>
He said China and Armenia have witnessed the smooth development
of bilateral relations and maintained high-level contacts since
diplomatic ties were established in April 1992.
</P>
<P>
He said cooperation in trade, economy, science, technology,
education, culture and health care have forged ahead since
then. The two countries also have cooperated well in major
international affairs, he added.
</P>
<P>
Qian emphasized that China values economic and trade
cooperation with Armenia, a major part of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He said Chinese and Armenian economies are mutually
complementary and there is great potential for bilateral economic
and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that China is looking forward to a visit by Armenian
President Levon Ter-Petrosyan and hopes the visit will add new
momentum to bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Papazyan praised the significant social and economic progress
made by China since the policies of reform and opening up to the
outside world were introduced 18 years ago. China's experience in
economic development merits Armenia's study, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that there are good prospects for expanding
Sino-Armenian relations and good bilateral relations are in the
interests of peoples in the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Sweden's Spring Budget Proposes Austerity, Tax Hikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Swedish government today
presented to Parliament an austerity budget which proposes curbing
government expenditure while raising some taxes.
</P>
<P>
In its spring budget, the government puts strict limits on
government spending in 1997 and 1998, and proposes to increase
revenue by 31 billion krona (4.7 billion U.S. dollars) over three
years from 1997 to 1999 through belt-tightening policies and
higher taxes.
</P>
<P>
The budget demands that Sweden, a major aid donor, reduce
foreign aid, cut subsidies to social welfare programs such as
medical care, jobless relief and public housing, and slash funds
for defense, sports and adult education.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, income tax, property tax and petroleum tax are to be
raised.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the budget, Minister of Finance Erik Asbrink stressed
the importance of on-going economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Although Sweden is a rich country, years of recession,
including three consecutive years of negative growth, and the
burden of the welfare state have depleted reserves and led to huge
budget deficits, Asbrink said.
</P>
<P>
Sweden's domestic and foreign debts, breaking the threshold of
1,000 billion krona (150 billion dollars), accounted for 80
percent of its gross national product in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The spring budget is part of an ambitious four-year plan to
curb public spending and increase revenue drawn up by the ruling
Social Democratic party, which took power in October 1995.
</P>
<P>
Economists expect Sweden's economy to grow by 1 percent this
year, 2 percent in 1997, 2.5 percent in 1998 and 1999, and 2
percent in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
They predict that the slow growth will make it difficult for
the Swedish government to realize one of its main goals of
reducing the unemployment rate from 8 percent to 4 percent, which
would require a growth rate above 3 percent.

<P>
BANGKOK, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Public Health Ministry
will put the brake on soaring imports and sales of untested
electronic physical therapy apparatus, which are being boosted by
exaggerated advertisements.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Approves Budget for Weapons Purchases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A seven-billion-baht (280 million
US dollars) arms procurement budget for the Thai Supreme Command
has been approved, according to a government source today.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa told the cabinet last week
that the five-year budget for the amount had been approved.
</P>
<P>
The approval came despite the government's concerns that arms
purchases were bloating the current account deficit and that it
would not hand over more money to fund the Defense Ministry's
spending plans.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, one billion baht (40 million dollars) will be
from the 1997 budget, and the rest from those of 1998-2001.
</P>
<P>
The one billion baht would be spent on armored cars, armored
personnel carriers and the air force's air defense system
development project.
</P>
<P>
Approval in principle for the military's Star of Siam satellite
project is still to be agreed, the source said.

<HEADLINE> More Urban People in Favor of Euthanasia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A recent investigation indicated
that about 75 percent of the people surveyed are in favour of
euthanasia, the mercy killing of people who are incurably ill and
undergoing great suffering, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The investigation, carried out by the Beijing Social
Investigation Institute and the Sociology Department of the
Huazhong Technology University, interviewed 3,105 persons aged
between 20 and 45 in Beijing, Shanghai and Wuhan, three of the
Biggest cities in China.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-three percent insist that choosing life or death is a
human right and 78 percent affirm that doctors are entitled to
implement euthanasia when patients wish it or require it.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, people under 24 with some
post-secondary education are the ones who most strongly favour
euthanasia.
</P>
<P>
The investigation also showed that 59 percent of these people
believe spiritual life is more important than material life, while
31 percent hold the opposite opinion.
</P>
<P>
An interesting discovery was that the higher the subjects'
income, the more they valued material life. However, among those
whose monthly income exceeds 2,000 yuan, less than 20 percent
emphasize the importance of material life.

<P>
STOCKHOLM, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Denmark achieved a record
sixth European team badminton title on Monday at the European
Championships in Herning, Denmark.
</P>
<P>
However, Denmark's All-England champion Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen
suffered a shock defeat. The world number two crashed 15-9, 15-13
to Sweden's Jens Olsson.
</P>
<P>
Hoyer-Larsen's reverse handed Sweden a 2-0 advantage but
singles player Camilla Martin and doubles pair Jon-Holst
Christensen and Thomas Lund squared the final.
</P>
<P>
In the women's doubles decider, the home pair of Rikke Olsen
and Helene Kirkegaard always held the upper hand against Maria
Bengtsson and Margit Borg and clinched the victory with an
identical 15-6.
</P>
<P>
Hoyer-Larsen, who had taken a break after winning the
All-England crown last month, has dented his chance of a
hat-trick of individual titles. He admitted that after winning the
All-England, he found it difficult to concentrate.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, he said the Atlanta Olympics was his top priority.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Designates New Area For Consulates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Foreign consulate officials
will be able to work and live in a special zone in this capital of
South China's Guangdong Province, the "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The Guangzhou Chigang Consulate Zone was provided two years ago
by the municipal government as a special area for consulates to
build their permanent offices and residences.
</P>
<P>
Now, infrastructure construction and landscaping have been
completed and the zone awaits new residents, said Chao Zhenwei,
director of the Guangdong Foreign Affairs Office.
</P>
<P>
Covering 230,000 square meters, the zone is available for 20-30
consulates.
</P>
<P>
The location, Chigang, is predicted to be one of the hottest
places during the city's development in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
For the first phase, consulates would be able to use the land
for less than 70 years after paying initial construction and
management fee.
</P>
<P>
Currently, foreign consulates are scattered around the city,
most of them renting hotels as offices and residences and
suffering from increasing prices.
</P>
<P>
Following the deepening reform and opening drive, Guangdong has
become more important in South China with its booming economy. And
the return of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997
is also bound to add more political weight to Guangzhou, according
to Chao.
</P>
<P>
Since 1979, nine countries have set up consulates general or
consulates here -- including the United States, Japan, Thailand,
Poland, Australia, Viet Nam, Malaysia, Canada and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Other countries like Russia, Britain and New Zealand are
expected to establish their consulates general in the near
future.

independent foreign policy of peace, particularly its principle of
equally treating all countries in the world, big or small.
</P>
<P>
Bagratyan also reiterated Armenia's commitments to pursue its
"one China" policy and not to develop official ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>

KIEV, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
made it clear today that his country was keen to develop a good
relationship with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),
but was still not ready to join it.
</P>
<P>
He told NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, who was here on a
two-day official visit, that Ukraine planned to expand its
cooperation with NATO in all non-military fields such as politics,
science and technology and information exchanging.

Ukraine and NATO signed an agreement to strengthen cooperation
last month.

When talking about NATO's planned eastward enlargement, the
president said it should be a step-by-step and transparent
process. He added that it was important for NATO to exchange views
with both Kiev and Moscow on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Solana also agreed that NATO should act with caution.
</P>
<P>
He then said Ukraine is one of the few countries which has
contributed peace-keeping forces in the conflicting Bosnian and
Istocna Slavonija areas.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that Ukraine abandon its non-aligned status to
promote the creation of an all-European security system.

<P>
SHENYANG, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Giant-sized apples gave farmers
visiting a country fair a real appetite for knowledge.
</P>
<P>
The country fair, a traditional occasion for Chinese farmers to
go shopping, turned into a venue for farmers to meet professors in
Benxi City, in northeast China's Liaoning Province, .
</P>
<P>
At the fair in Wolong Township, 100 professors from the
Shenyang Agricultural University and the provincial academy of
agriculture displayed 260 agro-technic achievements.
</P>
<P>
An old farmer picked up a big apple displayed by the university
and asked a professor how they produced such big apples. The
professor answered his questions in detail.
</P>
<P>
Sun Changwu, a farmer of the Jinlong Village, went to the fair
early in the morning to look for Professor Ge of the provincial
academy.
</P>
<P>
The year before last Ge sent Sun some hot pepper seeds when he
listened to Ge's technical lessons. Sun planted some seeds in a
small piece of land, which, as a result, yielded more than a half
kg of pepper for each shoot compared with the species he used to
plant. In the past two years, Sun paid four visits to Prof. Ge and
brought back more species with each visit.
</P>
<P>
Before the fair ended, many farmers had bought the technical
material, seeds and agricultural chemicals they needed.
</P>
<P>
At the fair, 752 projects, some 100 varieties of new technical
materials and more than 30,000 books were on display.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Strengthens Disease Prevention Along Borders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The provincial government of
Yunnan will invest some 500 million yuan (58 million US dollars)
to build a disease-prevention belt along the borders and set up an
AIDS-control network in the next five years, reported today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The goals are to stop infectious diseases among children from
spreading across the borders and to get the AIDS epidemic under
control by the year 2000, said Yang Chaobin, vice-director of the
Provincial Health Department.
</P>
<P>
The province also plans to control the spread of other adult
diseases, especially the plague, cholera and leprosy, through
strengthening grass-roots prevention programs, said Yang.
</P>
<P>
The disease-prevention belt will be established at six frontier
ports and in eight border prefectures and 26 border counties.
</P>
<P>
Located in Southwest china, Yunnan is a mountain province with
a frontier more than 4,000 kilometres long that touches Viet Nam,
Laos and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
As the local economy develops and opens up, the residents of
border areas of all the countries are communicating and doing
business -- and spreading more infectious diseases across Yunnan's
border, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the province detected a case of imported wild polio
virus in Dehong Prefecture, next to Myanmar, the only such case
registered in China last year.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the province has registered some 2,000 HIV-positive
patients, over 70 percent of the national total, of whom some have
already developed AIDS. Those patients who live in the border
areas were infected by various means: sharing dirty needles,
mother-to-infant transmission and sexual contact.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang, infectious diseases remain one of the major
threats to Yunnan's adults. The province lists 23 varieties of
infectious diseases. But he said that the province's
disease-prevention sector had seen great advancements in the past
several years.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Logging Gets the Chop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Forestry is to
curb excessive timber logging, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Over-consumption of timber is still a problem in some areas,
despite the work of special ministry organizations across the
country which check and control unauthorized logging,
transportation and timber sales.
</P>
<P>
According to the China Forestry News, Forestry Vice-Minister
Liu Yuhe told a forestry resource surveillance working conference
last week that the checks should be improved. Loose checks were to
blame for over-logging, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Forestry resources across the country will be put under strict
surveillance this year, especially in Northeast China and Inner
Mongolia, home to vast State-owned forestry resources, China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
The ministry and local authorities are expected to set the
annual logging quota for the next five years according to local
situations. And a temporary regulation on forestry resource
surveillance has been drafted.
</P>
<P>
The paper also said that China has increased the forest area
and the volume of timber over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
In 25 provinces and autonomous regions, the increase in timber
resources has been more than consumption. Others have matched
consumption with an increase in tree numbers.
</P>
<P>
China has a forest coverage rate of 13.92 percent with a stock
volume of more than 10 billion cubic metres, as suggests the
fourth national forest inventory (1989-93).

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Standing Committee of
China's National People's Congress (NPC) is to carry out
inspections in Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin, to ensure the
strict implementation of environmental laws.
</P>
<P>
The inspections in the three of China's biggest cities will be
completed by the end of June, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The English newspaper quoted Wang Bingqian, vice-chairman of the
NPC Standing Committee, as saying that the inspections were
designed to establish what problems exist in controlling pollution
in these cities and how to resolve them.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that Beijing and Shanghai were reported to be among
the 10 most seriously polluted cities in the world. They should
now act to reverse this situation and take the lead in protecting
the environment, he said.
</P>
<P>
The paper also quoted a senior legislator with the NPC's
Environmental and Resources Protection Committee as saying that
between July and September this year, the committee will conduct
similar inspections in Qinghai and Shaanxi provinces, as well as
the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The NPC's inspection on the implementation of State
environmental laws started three years ago.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, a total of 29 provinces and autonomous
regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government
will have undergone the inspections.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, three examinations have been combined with mass media
publicity on enforcing pollution control laws, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> UN Forecasts Further Rapid Growth in Eastern Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. economic survey today
predicted that rapid economic growth would continue in Eastern
Europe in 1996 while further depression would be likely in Russia
and most of the other former Soviet republics despite major
progress made with economic stabilization last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the economic survey published by the U.N. Economic
Commission for Europe (ECE), real GDP of Eastern European
economies grew by over 5 percent in 1995, following an average 4
percent the year before.
</P>
<P>
Within Eastern Europe, a core group of economies, including the
Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia which have made
considerable progress in the transition from central planning to a
market economy, have achieved GDP growth rates of 5 to 7 percent
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Among the other Eastern European countries, Albania achieved
remarkable GDP growth of 13.4 percent in 1995 while Romania's GDP
also improved sharply last year by 6.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
There has also been some recovery of GDP growth in the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia following the success of the February 1994
program to end hyperinflation, but in Croatia, Macedonia and
almost certainly Bosnia where no data are available, GDP continued
to fall.
</P>
<P>
According to the ECE survey, the performance of the Baltic
states still lags behind that of most of Eastern Europe.
Nevertheless, a somewhat hesitant recovery has become more firmly
established in Lithuania and Estonia, where GDP grew by some 2.5
percent last year. But in Latvia there was a further setback with
output falling again.
</P>
<P>
The deep depression of output in Russia and the other former
Soviet republics continued last year, but the fall in output
slowed considerably in a number of countries with output actually
increasing in Armenia and Georgia by 5.2 percent and 2.4 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
In Russia, GDP fell only by some 4 percent in 1995, against
earlier forecasts of 9 percent and a decline of nearly 13 percent
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In the aggregate, the survey said, GDP in the former Soviet
republics probably fell by some 5 percent in 1995 compared with 15
percent the year before.
</P>
<P>
On the outlook for the transition economies in 1996, the survey
said official expectations are for a further strengthening of the
recovery in Eastern Europe with an average growth rate of some 6
percent in GDP.
</P>
<P>
However, apart from the uncertainties of the reform process
itself, an important element of risk in the outlook for 1996
derives from the increasing ties between the eastern and western
parts of Europe, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, Eastern Europe is now very dependent
on Western Europe with nearly two thirds of all its exports going
to Western European markets. Therefore, the slow-down in 1996
growth rates in some Eastern European economies may be greater
than currently expected due to a slow-down in Western European
import demand.
</P>
<P>
Similar considerations also apply to the Baltic states, where
exports to Western Europe now account for probably just over 50
percent of the total. Output in the region is expected to grow in
1996 but much less strongly than in the rest of Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
According to the ECE survey, the outlook for Russia and the
other former Soviet republics remains very uncertain. There are
expectations of an upturn beginning to emerge in more countries
than Armenia and Georgia in 1996, but the survey said such a
possibility will very much depend on what happens in Russia.
</P>
<P>
There are hopes that if the progress made with economic
stabilization last year can be maintained, Russian output might
stabilize and began to rise in the course of 1996. But the survey
stressed that the uncertainties are considerable and that the
range of forecasts for 1996 include a further decline in output in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
The survey also noted that none of the forecasts made by the
Russian Ministry of the economy in January showed positive GDP
growth in 1996.

<HEADLINE> 7 People Wounded in Israeli Air Raid on Beirut's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Seven people were wounded in an
air raid by Israeli Helicopters at 5:05 p.m. local time (14:05
GMT) on Beirut's south suburbs, the Lebanese Army Command
announced tonight.
</P>
<P>
Today's air raid was the forth of its kind in five days at the
Shiite-Moslem populated suburbs of the Lebanese capital.
</P>
<P>
Israel today launched agressions targeting some dwelling
neighborhoods in Beirut's south suburbs and some civilian
establishments, leading to the wounding of seven civilians and
the destruction of some vehicles, the army command said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes attacked a transformer substation of
electricity at Fibsalim, causing serious damage to it, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli warplanes also launched air raids at 13
Lebanese towns in the south, and Israeli forces shelled the
southern Lebanese market town of Nabatiyeh and the port city of
Sour, said the statement, without mentioning casualties.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in the south said four people, including two
members of the Civilian Defense, were wounded in today's Israeli
agressions in south Lebanon, which have entered its fifth
successive day.
</P>
<P>
Most of the artillery shells the Israeli occupation forces
fired today, were poured at Nabatiyeh and villages in the western
and middle sectors of south Lebanon, the security sources said.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in five days Israel also bombarded the
southern port city of Saida, the biggest city in the southern part
of this country.
</P>
<P>
Police sources in Saida said two Israeli missiles hit a public
garden at downtown, noting that the two missiles were fired from
an Israeli warship in the Mediterranean opposite the city.
</P>
<P>
Several Israeli warplanes were enforcing a blockade on the
Beirut Port and other Lebanese ports, banning any ship from
pulling in to shore, on an excuse of preventing weapons from
being handed over to Hezbollah. The maritime blockade has been
imposed since Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military Wing of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, announced that they launched today a
number of volleys of katyusha rockets into northern Israel,
targeting the Jewish settlements of Kyriat Shmona, Sagamata and
Harfin.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berri inspected Sour city earlier
today, and called for a return of the south Lebanese residents,
who have been dispelled from their homes by the continuous
Israeli aggression, to their towns and villages in the south,
vowing that the government would make maximum efforts to ensure
their needs.
</P>
<P>
Berri described the Israeli agressions as a "maneuver not only
against Hezbollah but also against the whole of Lebanon,"
stressing that it should not be allowed to "diminish the July
understanding," a U.S.-mediated tacit agreement which put an end
to an Israeli blitz in south Lebanon in July, 1993.
</P>
<P>
Under the July understanding, Israel was asked to refrain from
attacking civilian targets in south Lebanon in exchange for a
Hezbollah promise to stop firing Katyusha rockets at Jewish
settlements in northern Israel. However, the understanding has
been repeatedly violated by both sides.

<HEADLINE> UK Companies to Join Reconstruction of Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Some British companies are more
likely to be awarded their first contracts for the reconstruction
of Bosnia within a month.
</P>
<P>
Defense Systems, a London-based private security company, is
close to signing a contract to clear mines from the former war
zone, a key step to pave the way for the overall construction,
according to a press report.
</P>
<P>
Amec, the engineering and construction group, is hoping to sign
utilities repair contracts within the coming few weeks, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Prospects for British companies brightened after
representatives from 50 countries and 30 international
organizations promised a 1.23-billion-U.S. dollar package for
rebuilding Bosnia recently in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
David Robson, chairman of Amec's manufacturing and services
division, was reported to have said his company already had people
in Bosnia working on securing contracts for repairing gas, water
and electricity supplies as well as rebuilding roads.
</P>
<P>
The British Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) said in a
statement that it has received inquiries from 200 companies about
work in the former Yugoslavia and the competition to win contracts
is becoming more and more heated.
</P>
<P>
The DTI is planning to hold a conference in London on April 29
on opportunities arising from reconstruction of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that up to 12 billion dollars will be spent on
rebuilding war-ravaged former Yugoslavia over the next four years
and war damage has been estimated at 50 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises Against Mark, Unchanged Against Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar today rose
against the German mark on growing expectations of a German
interest rate cut but remained unchanged against the Japanese yen.
h  Traders got some hints from the remarks of the president of the
Bundesbank, Hans Tietmeyer, last week that the German central bank
was prepared to cut interest rates later this week.
</P>
<P>
The lowering of the German mark will enhance the position of
the dollar, because returns from investing in the mark will become
less appealing.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.5127 marks, up
from 1.5035 marks Friday. The rate hit a 14-month high.
</P>
<P>
Against the yen, the dollar was unchanged at 108.55 yen.
</P>
<P>
Germany's unemployment stood near post-war highs at 10.8
percent, according to earlier reports. The central bank of the
country is likely to lower the interest rate to boost the economy,
according to some analysts.
</P>
<P>
While many traders took profits on the dollar's recent gains,
investors also decided Monday was a good day to buy the Japanese
currency after the dollar touched 26-month highs against the yen
last week, gaining 0.8 percent by Friday.

<HEADLINE> US Nearly Completes Evacuation Work in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States has nearly
completed its evacuation effort in Liberia but it will maintain a
diplomatic presence in the country, the State Department said here
today.
</P>
<P>
"The bulk of the evacuation of non-official Americans appears
to be over," State Department spokesman Glyn Davies told a press
briefing, adding that the U.S. rescue special forces would
"continue to assist Americans citizens and others in need of
assistance to reach our embassy compound, and every day we go out
to help people get into the compound."
</P>
<P>
Several U.S. warships carrying helicopters were sent to the sea
off Liberia earlier in the month to help evacuate fleeing
Americans and people from other nations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. forces have reportedly made 65 helicopter sorties in
the past few days and have evacuated a confirmed total of 1,795
people from Monrovia, 306 of whom were U.S. citizens, and the rest
from 64 other countries.
</P>
<P>
Davies said U.S. military assets "will remain in the region
until we can be reasonably assured that (remaining) Americans are
safe."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman disclosed that the U.S. Ambassador to Liberia
Bill Milan was still in the capital of Liberia "to help negotiate
an end to the fighting and to move the parties back to the Abuja
peace accord." The agreement was signed last August in the
Nigerian capital of Lagos.

<HEADLINE> Early Warning System Reduces Hunger Death Toll In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian government
said today that the application of the early warning system has
helped to drastically reduce death toll caused by hunger to less
than 10,000 in 1993/94 from over one million a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the Disaster Prevention and Preparedness
Commission of Ethiopia, Yibrah Hagos, was quoted by the Ethiopian
News Agency as saying that the policy played a significant role
in helping maintain the food security reserve.
</P>
<P>
Out of 8 million people were exposed to natural disasters in
1984/85, which had killed nearly one million people.
</P>
<P>
But with the application of the early warning system, only
less than 10,000 of the 6.7 million people lost their lives in
1993/94.

<HEADLINE> Yemen Denies Military Build-up in Zuqar Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A Yemeni government source denied
today the presence of a Yemeni military build-up in the Red Sea
island of Zuqar.
</P>
<P>
The source asserted that the Yemeni garrison in the island has
not been reinforced, neither by troops nor by weapons, ever since
the Eritrean occupation of the disputed island of Greater Hanish
in mid-December 1995.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in today's local Yemeni daily Al Hayat,
the source also reiterated Yemen's commitment to the principle of
peaceful settlement of the Yemeni-Eritrean conflict, and not
resorting to force for the settlement of border differences with
neighboring countries, including Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The source, who asked not to be named, pointed out that reports
about Yemeni build-up of troops and naval equipment in the island
of Zuqar were a mere attempt to push the two parties to escalate
their dispute to the extent of military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Such confrontation would only destroy the potentials of Yemen
and Eritrea at a time when the two countries were in great need of
economic development and reconstruction rather than being dragged
into a struggle, the source added.
</P>
<P>
The source indicated that the international community has
realized the reality of the Yemeni stance which calls for a
peaceful settlement through mediation or international arbitration
in line with the declaration of principles proposed by the French
government.
</P>
<P>
The source said that the Yemeni government has agreed to the
French proposal, and has made compromises to prompt the Eritrean
side to accept the peaceful option and to resolve the dispute
through an agreement on the demarcation of the maritime borders
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Yemen and Eritrea, which face each other across the Strait of
Bab el-Mandeb at the southern tip of the Red Sea, fought a brief
battle on the island of Greater Hanish in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
The island of Greater Hanish, which is now controlled by the
Eritreans, is one of the three islands claimed both by Yemen and
Eritrea. The nearby two others are Lesser Hanish and Zuqar, which
are under the control of Yemen.
