<HEADLINE> Jordanian Premier Receives Canadian Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Karim Kabariti met here today with Andrew Robinson, Canada's
Middle East peace coordinator, on the latest development of the
regional peace process on all tracks and the obstacles facing it.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian prime minister reiterated the kingdom's pursuit
to activate the process out of its keenness to achieve a
comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the region, Radio Jordan
reported today.
</P>
<P>
He called for collective international efforts, saying that
securing progress towards that end would help realize economic and
social development in the region.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that endeavors should focus on solving the
refugee problems, which he said, is a "basic element" for
establishing a just peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The visit by Canada's peace coordinator to Jordan came at a
time when the stalled Middle East peace process was endangered by
Israeli "warlike" statements, Syria's troop movements in south
Lebanon and the verbal cross-attacks between Israel, Syria and
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai warned Syria Sunday
against the temptation of using military pressure to force Israel
back to the negotiating table on its terms.
</P>
<P>
"I issue this warning to Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad: 'Remember that Israel is strong and its army is ready to
carry out whatever tasks it must," said the Israeli minister.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the leading member in the Arab world, warned Monday that
Israel's warlike statements to Syria could provoke a similar
reaction in the Arab world and torpedo the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's leading daily Al Akhar said Monday that most Egyptians,
despite their 1979 peace treaty with Israel, would want a break in
ties or even a war because of the "provocative" statements made
by Israeli defense minister.
</P>
<P>
The recent eastward and southward movement of Syrian troops
from Lebanon had raised eyebrows in Jerusalem. The Israeli
government has reportedly decided to increase Israeli forces in
the Golan Heights in response to Syrian troop movements in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Tension between Israel and Syria have risen since Benjamin
Netanyahu took office in June. Netanyahu has said he does not want
to return the Golan in exchange for peace with Syria, as the
previous Israeli government had indicated it would do.

CANBERRA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The booming Asian beer

PARIS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Zaire's Foreign Ministry today
summoned Rwandan ambassador in Kinshasa to protest against
Rwanda's "aggression" after heavy fightings Sunday night and
Monday in areas between Bukavu, eastern Zaire, and Cyangugu,
southwest Rwanda, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Zaire's Vice Prime Minister Kamanda Wa Kamanda
pointed out in a speech that Rwanda should be responsible for the
fightings.
</P>
<P>
He accused Rwanda of "providing assistance to armed bands of
Banyamurenge" -- the ethnic Tutsis, and said that the Banyamurenge
militias were infiltrating into Zairean territory to launch
"operations of destabilizaiton."
</P>
<P>
However, he refrained from making any threat to Rwanda and
Burundi in his speech.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month Zaire alleged that Rwanda and Burundi were
"fomenting troubles" in the region of Uvira, but met rejection
from both of them.
</P>
<P>
It launched a large-scale hunting of "Banyamurenge" Tutsis in
the hills near the Burundian border.
</P>
<P>
About one million Rwandan Hutu refugees have been living in
refugee camps in eastern Zaire, after they fled Rwanda following a
genocide committed by Hutu army and militias against Tutsis and
Hutu people in 1994.

<P>
The federation studied records going back to 1888 and Puskas,
playing for Honved and Real Madrid between 1943 and 1966, was the
only player to have scored over 500 goals in national championship
games, a report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Pele may scored more than 1,200 goals in his career, but
because Brazilian national championships didn't start until 1970,
most of Pele's goals didn't make the record books.
</P>
<P>
The official presentation of Puskas's award, along with another
nine all-time greatest scorers will be November 2 in Leipzig,
Germany.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Donor countries have pledged 14
million U.S. dollars in support of the U.N. Relief Works Agency
(UNRWA) to help it tackle a cash shortage threatening services to
millions of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
This was announced today by UNRWA Commissioner General Peter
Hansen who called for a meeting of host governments and donor
countries to discuss the agency's deficit and current financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which opened here on Monday, agreed on the
importance of the UNRWA's role in the Middle East and reaffirm
support for the agency to ensure its continued and uninterrupted
services to the Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan made a speech at the meeting,
saying that the role of the UNRWA must be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
He told delegates that stability in the region requires
international cooperation to assist the U.N. body.

<P>
According to the crown prince, the total number of the
Palestinian refugees in the Middle East amounts to more than 3.2
million, of whom 41 percent are hosted by Jordan and 38 percent in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The services Jordan provided to the refugees cost the kingdom
more than 300 million dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
Robert Hopkins, director of UNRWA's operations, announced
Monday at the meeting that the American delegation had pledged an
additional 5 million dollars to the agency's budget which

<HEADLINE> China Carries out Comprehensive Survey of Wild Animals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- China has started a
nationwide comprehensive survey of the country's wild animals to
determine their population and distribution, and learn more about
their habitats.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhibao, vice minister of forestry, said during today's
working conference on the overall survey of wild animals, that the
key to protecting wild animals is guaranteeing their growth and
development.
</P>
<P>
The five-year survey will involve 141 species of birds, 70
types of mammals and 44 kinds of reptiles in 30 provinces,
municipalities and autonomous regions across the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that the survey is designed to provide reliable
information that can be used to formulate an effective protection
strategy for wild animals.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the Ministry of Forestry carried out similar surveys
in 11 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions on a trial
basis.
</P>
<P>
During China's present period of rapid economic growth, the
wasteland-reclamation efforts and development of the rural economy
have reduced the number of wildlife habitats, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there is a greater demand for the exploitation and
use of wildlife resources, he added.
</P>
<P>
The vice minister said that China will create archives for the
country's wild animal resources, to guide effective protection
measures as well as domestication and exploitation strategies.
</P>
<P>
The survey, with its wide scope, is the first its kind in the
country, he said.
</P>
<P>
China now has 17,000 people working in the fields of wild
animal resource protection and research, and the country has
opened 25 wildlife protection organizations in its provinces,
municipalities and autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Forestry has invested in 71 national nature
preserves and 503 local preserves.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong: Big Player In Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong has become the
single largest outward investor among Asian developing economies,
according to the 1996 issue of the World Investment Report, which
says the outflows of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) from the
region amounted to 25 billion US dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
A good part of the outflows goes into China, says the report
released today in Geneva by the United Nations Conference on Trade
and Development (UNCTAD).
</P>
<P>
The inflows of FDI into Hong Kong, 2.1 billion US dollars in
1995, fall far short of the outflows.
</P>
<P>
"It does not imply a loss of confidence in Hong Kong," said
Professor Edward K.Y. Chen, President of Lingnan College at a news
conference here today, who gave a general introduction to the
annual report, the fifth published by UNCTAD since 1992.
</P>
<P>
In his view, the figures simply reflect normal commercial
activities to rationalize production and accumulate wealth. Hong
Kong is a funding center which draws money from other places of
the world and then pours into China, so the big outflows are not
all from Hong Kong investors, said Chen.
</P>
<P>
Touching on Hong Kong after 1997, the reports says the city
should continue to be a separate customs territory and an
independent member of the World Trade Organization
(WTO). According to Chen, there is good evidence that the whole
world has confidence in Hong Kong so long as it maintains the
current economic independence as stipulated in the Basic Law, the
de facto constitution of the future Special Administrative
Region.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD plays an important role in promoting trade and
investment throughout the world.

HONG KONG, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Six died from a gas leakage
in a skyscraper apartment in the New Territory and one was in
critical condition, reports the local evening broadcast.
</P>
<P>
Three men, one women and two children were proved dead after
being sent to hospital this morning. Doctors believed that the six
were suffocated to death for lack of oxygen since no wound was
found on their bodies.
</P>
<P>
Police found the victims at around eight o'clock this morning
after the gas alarm rang. The leakage from a gas cylinder in the
kitchen led to the death. They suspected that homicide and suicide
could be involved in the case, which is now under investigation.
</P>
<P>
The dead were four adults aged between 30 and 50, a boy at the
age of six and a three-year-old girl.

<HEADLINE> France, Japan to Launch Research on Nuclear Reactor Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- France and Japan are to launch
a joint research on how to deal with accidents that can lead to
partial melting of the core of rapid neutron reactors.
</P>
<P>
They signed last week a five-year contract on eight experiments
between 1996 and 2000 at 200 million francs (40 million
U.S. dollars), according to the Institute of Nuclear Protection
and Safety (IPSN) of France and the Power Reactor and Fuel
Development Corporation (PNC) of Japan today.
</P>
<P>
The program, named "Cabri-Reactor Accident Test Fuel," comes as
part of a plan by France and Japan to continue developing rapid
neutron nuclear reactors as their important energy resource in the
next century, said IPSN and PNC officials.
</P>
<P>
It will focus on the study of consequences of an uncontrolled
recovery of a control rod of the reactors and on the evolution of
physical phenomena immediately after an accident of reactivity
takes place.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, France is using its 1,300 megawatt Superpheonix
reactor in Creys-Malville in the eastern part of the country to
study on reduction of plutonium stocks and elimination of products
of dangerous atomic fissions.
</P>
<P>
The first French-Japanese joint experiment will be launched in
November at the IPSN installations in Cadarache, southeast of
France.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese 280-megawatt Monju reactor has been out of service
since 1994 when a fire accident caused a breakdown of the
installation. The incident aroused protests from ecologists and
is still under investigation.

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM Meets Egyptian Ambassador to Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 24 (Xinhua) -- In a sign of deepening
feud, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy today summoned
Egyptian Ambassador Mohammed Bassyouni to protest so-called
Cairo's anti-Israeli statements.
</P>
<P>
Levy told Bassiouny that Egypt should halt the recent verbal
attacks heard from Cairo, if it wanted the peace process to
advance.
</P>
<P>
Bassyouni, on his part, denied that Egypt had issued an
ultimatum to Israel, but only wanted it to take "tangible steps"
to push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, Bassiouny telephoned Cabinet Secretary Danny
Naveh to explain that Cairo's statements might have been
misquoted by the press. He said it was not Egypt's policy to
attack any individual despite the difference existing between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli protest came after recent press reports quoted
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
as warning that Israel's hardline policies could lead to the
revival of Palestinian uprising and set back bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
In a newspaper interview, Moussa reportedly demanded that
Israel take quick actions in the following weeks in the following
fields: immediately pulling back its troops from the West Bank
town of Hebron; reviving the final-status talks with the
Palestinians; lifting the closure on Palestinian territories;
resuming peace talks with Syria at the point it broke off;
declaring its willingness to withdraw troops from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In a sharper attack Monday, Egyptian Assistant Foreign
Minister Fathi el-Shazli lashed out at statements made by Israeli
leaders, including Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, on recent
tension with Syria, describing them as "banging of war drums." He
said Israeli leaders were "amateur politicians" who talked like
"dinosaurs."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egypt staged last week the biggest military
exercise in history aimed at countering a possible
non-conventional attack by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has long demanded Israel renounce its nuclear capability
or subject it to international inspection. The nuclear issue is
one of the major obstacles blocking the improvement of relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Egypt was the first Arab country to make peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
To push forward the peace process, Egypt, playing a leading
role in the Arab world, has been trying to form an united Arab
front against Israel after the hardline Likud government came to
power in June. The Egyptian moves caused great displeasure among
the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Despite Netanyahu's July visit to Cairo, his first trip to an
Arab country, and Levy's visit early this month, the deep
differences between Egypt and Israel seemed to have hardly been
bridged.

<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- A reception marking the 40th
anniversary of the establishment of Sino-Yemeni diplomatic ties
was held in Beijing this evening.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign
Countries (CPAFFC), along with the China-Yemen Friendship
Association (CYFA), hosted the event.
</P>
<P>
Wang Guangying, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of
China's National People's Congress, attended the reception.
</P>
<P>
The CYFA President, Zhang Canming, said that China and Yemen
are ancient countries in Asia, and that the friendship between the
two peoples dates back to the far-distant past.
</P>
<P>
He noted that both countries are also developing countries, and
that the two peoples have conducted sincere cooperation in many
fields and established bonds of deep friendship.
</P>
<P>
Yemen is one of the first Arab nations to establish diplomatic
ties with China, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that cooperation in every area between the two
countries has thrived over the past 40 years, and he expressed the
belief that the friendship between the two peoples will continue
to grow.
</P>
<P>
Yemen's Ambassador to China, Mohammed Hadi Awad, said that
Yemen and China have experienced the same sort of difficulties in
their histories.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, both hold that state-to-state relations should be
developed on the basis of the principle of "non-interference into
each other's internal affairs, and mutual respect for each other's
sovereignty," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"The Yemeni government supports China in realizing its
reunification and recognizes that Taiwan is an inalienable part of
China," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes that the friendly cooperative relations
between the two countries will continue to develop.
</P>
<P>
Also present were Li Chengren, deputy head of the International
Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China, the CPAFFC Vice-President Xu Qun, and guests from other
departments.

post amid the looming possibility that embattled Banharn might
choose to dismiss parliament for a new general election.
</P>
<P>
Currently, choosing a candidate who will satisfy all the six
coalition parties seems to be a very tough task as major
differences exist among the six coalition parties, especially
between Banharn and New Aspiration Party (NAP) leader Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh.
</P>
<P>
Banharn gave up his prime minister throne to exchange for
support from his coalition partners in the censure debate against
him in parliament, when Chavalit led a sudden coalition drive to
push Banharn to resign in exchange for their support minutes
before the voting on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Banharn survived the vote by 207 to 180, but he might not
forgive Chavalit. Banharn reportedly has planned to propose
Pramarn Adireksarn, founder of the Chart Thai (Thai Nation) Party
(CTP), or his son Pongpol Adireksarn, to succeed him to block
Chavalit from becoming new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
However, Chavalit, leader of the second largest ruling party
and also deputy prime minister and defense minister, was backed by
some party leaders, including Nam Thai (Thai Leadership) Party
(NTP) leader Anmuay Virawan and Palang Dharma (Virtue Force) party
leader Thaksin Shinawatra.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit currently is the most powerful candidate within the
coalition and some local newspapers said that the six coalition
parties (including some CTP members) have reached a tacit
agreement on choosing Chavalit as new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay, who is an economic expert, is
another potential candidate within the coalition, as the country
needs an economic leader to tackle the existing economic woes.
</P>
<P>
A recent small-scale informal survey among Thai leading
businessmen conducted by the newspaper Bangkok Post showed that
Anmuay topped the list.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Anmuay may have problems in controlling the coalition as
his party only have 18 seats in parliament and analysts said the
cabinet under his leadership would be highly volatile with a
little party backing.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, if the six coalition parties -- CTP, NAP, NTP,
Prachakorn Thai (Thai Citizen) Party, Muan Chon (Mass) Party and
Social Action Party -- fail to reach consensus on a candidate from
the coalition, Chatichai Choonhavan, leader of the Chart Pattana
(National Development) Party might have an opportunity to step in
as new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Banharn now is using his last trump card - dismissal of
parliament - to negotiate with his coalition partners to win
favorable arrangements in the new government for his party before
he resigns, although his coalition partners insisted that Banharn
should resign before they elect a new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
At present, with Banharn's strong opposition to Chavalit and
insistence of choosing a successor from the CTP, the situation
remains complicated. The selection of a new prime minister might
resort to a parliamentary election, so it is quite possible for a
black horse to emerge.

KUALA LUMPUR, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today urged
Bangladesh to restructure its employment mechanism and give
legally recruited workers an orientation course before being sent
to this country.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion was made by Malaysian Deputy Human Resource
Minister A. K. Sheikh Fadzir when he met visiting Bangladesh State
Minister for Foreign Affairs Abul Hasan Chowdhury here, the

</P>
<P>
Abul Hasan arrived here yesterday for a four-say visit at a

various social problems like harassing local women.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Fadzir said both sides at the meeting emphasized that
the Malaysian government could punish and even send back any
Bangladeshi citizens who misbehave or flout the law of the
country.
</P>
<P>
There are about 100,000 Bangladeshi workers in Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> China Welcomes US Investors and Traders: Vice Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li
Lanqing today told the Illinois State Trade Delegation, headed by
Governor Jim Edgar, that China welcomes American companies to
invest in the country and conduct trade here.
</P>
<P>
China welcomes investment in China from big businesses,
such as Motorola, as well as cooperation with small and medium-sized
enterprises, Li said in a meeting this afternoon with the group.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, the economies of China and the US are
complementary, and show great potential for economic cooperation.
He said he hopes the two sides will work more closely with each
other to fully explore their opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier stressed that only when the two countries
respect dissimilarities in each other's culture and history can
cooperation be effective.
</P>
<P>
Edgar echoed Li's views by saying that differences in political
opinions should not influence economic cooperation. In fact, he
said, the establishment of stronger trade ties between US and
China might help solve political issues.
</P>
<P>
Li also briefed the US guests on China's major areas for
foreign investment. He said he believes that the forthcoming visit
by Wu Yi, minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, to
the Unites States will enhance trade ties between the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> China's Position on Diaoyu Islands Remains Unchanged: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Shen Guofang said at a press conference here this
afternoon that the Diaoyu Islands belong to China, and China's
position on this issue remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The Diaoyu Islands have been part of the Chinese territory
since ancient times, he said.
</P>
<P>
But the Japanese side has recently created disturbances on the
issue, which has seriously encroached on China's territorial
integrity and sovereignty and is sure to arouse strong indignation
among all Chinese, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan
compatriots, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people's determination to safeguard sovereignty and
territorial integrity will never change, Shen added.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that the Japanese side should adopt an
appropriate attitude and fully understand the gravity of the
issue, and not create any new disturbances.
</P>
<P>
Shen held that the Japanese side should stop any actions that
encroach on China's sovereignty, and that it has a responsibility
to see that no new disturbances will be created.
</P>
<P>
Touching upon a recent Japan-US agreement, which stated that
the two sides have the right to interfere if there is any trouble
around Japan, Shen recalled past events and said that "the real
threat in our region is Japan."
</P>
<P>
He said that during the World War Two, the war of aggression
launched by the Japanese militarists against Asian countries
caused great suffering for Asian people -- including the Japanese
people.
</P>
<P>
Peace in the Asia-Pacific region should be maintained jointly
by the governments and people of Asian countries, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He added that the agreement is a bilateral arrangement between
Japan and the US, and if this arrangement exceeds the bilateral
realm by aiming at a third party and concerning interests of other
countries, it will make the situation develop in a complicated way.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that the Japanese government can keep
clear-minded about this issue.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Import Jordanian Farm Produce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Agricultural Marketing
Corporation (AMC) of Jordan Monday announced that the Israeli
government agreed to import several kinds of fresh Jordanian
fruits and vegetables from now until the end of December 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian exports to Israel will be exempted from customs
in implementation of the agreements signed between the two
countries, the English daily Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The AMC called on Jordanian farmers to enter the Israeli
market and export agricultural products of international
standards.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said AMC's board of directors agreed to import
mango, avocado and kiwi from Israel as of October 1 until the end
of this year.
</P>
<P>
They said the Israeli authorities agreed that the Jordanian
importers of Israeli commodities could in turn export Jordanian
agricultural produce to the Israeli market.
</P>
<P>
They added that the agricultural products allowed to enter the
Israeli market are tomato, cucumber, hot pepper, lettuce,
eggplants, squash, beans, apples, grapes and various kinds of
melons.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Israel opened door wider for Jordanian exports to
the Palestinian self-rule areas by increasing the quotas on the
list of goods the Palestinians are allowed to import from Jordan,
without being subject to Israeli standards.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials accused earlier this year the Israeli
government of hindering the implementation of Jordanian-Israeli
and Jordanian-Palestinian trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government repeatedly asked its Israeli
counterpart to take concrete measures to boost trade exchange
between the two sides and between Jordan and the West Bank, in
order to make the ordinary Jordanians feel the "peace dividends."
</P>
<P>
Figures available show that Jordan witnessed a great trade
deficit with Israel last year, with 825,000 U.S. dollars of
imports and 85,500 dollars of exports.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Israel signed a peace agreement in October 1994.

BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- A research center designed to
preserve the operas of more than a dozen minority nationalities
opened today in the Central University of Nationalities in western
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Li Peilun, secretary general of the China Society For Minority
Nationality Operas and director of the center, said that a

minority nationalities are nearly extinct, and that fewer people
are participating in them, particularly youngsters.

culture.
</P>

Li said that in addition to its research work, the center will
establish a department of national operas in the university within
the next two or three years. The university is China's major
educational venue for the young people of the 55 minority
nationalities.

<HEADLINE> Asthma To Rise As Result of Global Warming, Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The world's asthmatic
population would rise as global warming created ideal breeding
conditions for dust mites, mould and cockroaches and caused dogs
and cats to moult and salivate more, a conference heard today.
</P>
<P>
Higher temperatures would also lead to more use of air
conditioning and insulation, decreasing the turnover of indoor air
and allowing asthma allergens to multiply, Macquarie University
scientists Prof. Peter Curson and Dr. Paul Beggs told the Climate
Change and Human Health Conference here.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 million people, they said, around the world
already suffered from asthma, including two million Australians.
Almost one million school days were lost each year in Australia
because of the chronic airways disorder which was the most
important reason for hospitalization of young children.
</P>
<P>
"Climate change will have profound effects on asthma not only
by directly influencing the distribution, life cycle and
prevalence of a wide range of allergens and irritants but also by
indirectly influencing human behavior," the scientists told the
conference.
</P>
<P>
The most common asthma triggers were house dust mites,
cockroaches, mould and hair and saliva from domestic pets. Dust
mites and cockroaches both bred best where the temperature was
over 20 degrees Celsius while moulds did well in dark, humid and
poorly ventilated conditions.
</P>
<P>
Australia had the highest rate of pet ownership in the world
with the number of domestic pets likely to grow with the human
population. Many of these pets spend considerable time inside
homes in close contact with their owners.
</P>
<P>
"Warmer temperatures and higher humidity may also influence the
moulting pattern of pets like cats and may also have an impact on
saliva production," the scientists pointed out.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Excludes 20 Indicted Rwandans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) announced today it was
excluding from refugee statues 20 Rwandans in connection with the
1994 genocide in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here today, the UNHCR also urged
governments to take the same measure if these Rwandans, indicted
by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), seek
asylum.
</P>
<P>
"The 20 Rwandans are believed to be among those behind the
execution and planning of the genocide in which more than 500,000
Rwandans were killed," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"Some of these Rwandans are in the custody of the tribunal,
including three who were arraigned in the Tanzanian town of
Arusha in June. The others are believed to be in Europe and
Africa," it added.
</P>
<P>
The exclusions were first announced by UNHCR on the basis of
the ICTR indictments since more than two million Rwandan refugees
flooded into neighboring Zaire, Tanzania and Burundi following
the three-month civil war and genocide in Rwanda in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council resolution which established the
ICTR requires the cooperation of inter-governmental and
non-governmental organizations and countries to take measures to
bring to justice persons responsible for the genocide and
flagrant violations of international humanitarian law in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, to
which 131 states are currently party, sets out the criteria for
recognition of refugees and standards for their treatment.
</P>
<P>
It also provides for the exclusion of "any person with respect
to whom there are serious reasons for considering that he has
committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against
humanity."
</P>
<P>
A similar exclusion provision is found in the 1969 Refugee
Convention of the Organization of the African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
UNHCR believed that the indictments by the tribunal constitute
sufficient grounds for exclusion from refugee status in
accordance with its own mandate and the OAU convention.

reopening of the market in accordance with the Oslo 2 agreement,
calling for a halt to the Jewish settlement expansion and for
implementation of Israeli troop redeployment from Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The rally was attended by Hanan Ashrawi, member of the
Palestinian Council and Palestinian Authority Minister of Higher
education, Abdul Jaward Saleh, member of the Palestinian Council,
Mustafa Natshe, Mayor of Hebron, and a number of noted

</P>
<P>
The rally turned into a demonstration when Israeli soldiers
came to intervene. Physical clashes happened between the two
sides. Soldiers indiscriminately beat the demonstrators, who threw
stones at them in response.
</P>

The soldiers threatened to beat Ashrawi and Natshe but were
blocked by demonstrators. Three Palestinians were wounded and an
ABC photographer was also attacked. A total of seven Palestinians
were arrested.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli military authorities declared Hebron to be a
closed military zone, but clashes are still continuing in
various parts of the West Bank city.

<P>
BEIRUT, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Major General Emile Lahoud,
commander of the Lebanese Army, inspected today army forces
which had been sent to strengthen positions in the south
part of Beqaa Valley opposite an Israeli-occupied border strip
in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During the inspecting, Lahoud stressed that the recent
Israeli threat of military strikes against Lebanon would "lead
to nothing but tighter attachment between the land and the
defense of it."
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that a coordination between Lebanon and Syria
would "continue on various levels" in order to confront
Israeli aggressions.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese army sent thousands of troops in reinforcements,
including commandos and special task forces, backed by tanks and
armored personal carriers to Western Beqaa in southeastern
Lebanon since Friday.
</P>
<P>
Before the move of the Lebanese army, Syria had redeployed
about one third of its 35,000-strong forces in Lebanon, which
used to station in Beirut and its suburbs, to the range of
mountains on the Lebanese-Syrian borders where Syria had
installed SAM-7 anti-aircraft missiles.
</P>
<P>
Damascus stressed that the redeployments of its troops in
Lebanon was "defensive" in light of the Israeli repreated
threats.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, guerrillas of the Lebanese
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, announced that they
opened fire at noon today at an Israeli force attempting to
infiltrate out of the Israeli self-proclaimed "security zone."
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah, said
that one group of its fighters fired artillery and machine
guns at an Israeli patrol attempting to approach the town of
Habboush from the Israeli position of Souida.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Malaysian Navy
(RMN) will set up its second largest base at a 144-hectare site at
Teluk Sepangar in Sabah State, Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar
said today.
</P>
<P>
The RMN base will be constructed in stages and the first phase
will involve a cost of 60 to 100 million ringgit (about 24 to 40
million US dollars), he was quoted by Malaysia's official news
agency Bernama as saying.
</P>
<P>
But he did not disclose when the construction of the naval base
in Teluk Sepangar will commence.
</P>
<P>
The largest RMN base is situated in Lumut, Perak State.
</P>
<P>
Teluk Sepangar was selected for setting up the second largest
RMN base because it is situated in a strategic area besides many
other natural advantages and its deep waters, according to a
defense ministry statement.
</P>
<P>
When the proposed base is completed, the RMN would continue to
maintain its presence in Labuan, a Federal Territory close to
Sabah, but at a smaller scale, the statement said, adding the RMN
base in Labuan would be used as a logistics depot.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Urges Peace Pact Opponents Not to Go Beyond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today warned those who are still against the peace efforts
in Mindanao not to go beyond the limits of the law.
</P>
<P>
"We have every right to express our disagreement, but let us
not be disagreeable," Ramos told a multisectoral assembly at
Kidapawan, North Cotabato province in southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government and the Moro National Liberation
Front (MNLF) signed a peace agreement on September 2 to end a
24-year-old war in Mindanao. Part of the peace agreement is the
establishment of a zone of peace and development and the Southern
Philippines Council for Peace and Development.
</P>
<P>
However, the peace agreement raised widespread opposition from
the Christian majority in Mindanao and other rebel groups such as
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the government and MILF are preparing to
hold peace talks, but the armed vigilante groups in Mindanao still
pose threat to the peace process in the region.
</P>
<P>
Ramos has toured the region several times, but every time he
went there he heard a lot of opposition to the peace efforts. Some
local people even threw rotten tomatoes at the president to voice
their anger at the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government has recognized the lawful right of
the people to express their opposition, but "I also admonish them
not to go beyond the limits of the law," the president said.

<HEADLINE> Date Announces to Retire After Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Kimiko Date, world number seven
in women's tennis rankings and one of the most popular athletes in
Japan, announced Tuesday she would retire at the end of the
season.
</P>
<P>
Date, who turns 26 on Saturday, told a news conference here
that she had achieved all she could and came to think that now was
the limit of her strength.
</P>
<P>
She said she first began thinking of retiring in June when the
Women's Tennis Association (WTA) announced it would introduce a
new, more severe, world ranking system from next year.
</P>
<P>
"I felt a sense of fulfilment, particularly last year and this
year, because I think I played evenly-balanced matches with the
top players in the world," Date said.
</P>
<P>
She said she made her final decision just before the start of
last week's Nichirei women's tournament in Tokyo in which she
lost a tough three-set semifinal against joint world number one
Monica Seles.
</P>
<P>
After turning professional in 1989, Date became the first
Japanese player to reach the world top 10 in January 1994 and
achieved her highest ranking of world number four at the end of
last year.
</P>
<P>
Date obtained the seventh tour victory of her career last
month when she beat Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain in the final
of the Toshiba tournament in the United States.
</P>
<P>
She won her first professional tournament in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Date gained an upset win over Steffi Graf in the quarter-finals
of the Federation Cup in April, leading Japan to the semifinals
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Graf was also her opponent when she produced one of her best
performances in this July's Wimbledon semifinals.
</P>
<P>
Date reeled off six successive games to level the match at one
set each before play was halted because of bad light. Graf
regained the initiative the following day to win 6-2 2-6 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Date said she had not decided what to do after her career ends
at the WTA championship in New York in November.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda, Zaire Exchange Fire Overnight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda today accused Zairean
troops of firing at its forces in the border town of Bukavu at
first, resulting in the exchange of eight hours of heavy gunfire
between the two sides overnight.
</P>
<P>
A report from Kigali quoted Emmanuel Ndahiro, Adviser to
Rwandan Vice-President and Defense Minister Paul Kagame as
saying that Zairean forces in Bukavu opened fire first, using
anti-aircraft guns and 75 mm recoiless rifles.
</P>
<P>
It was the second night of fighting between the two sides.
Observers here say they fought for the reason of more then one
million Rwandan refugees present in the eastern part of Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda accuses Zaire of backing its Hutu rebels to cross in to
mount raids inside the country while Zaire accuses Rwanda of
helping Tutsis from Burundi infiltrate into eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
``There was more fighting last night. We are checking for
casualties. The truth is that the zaireans fired first. We
opened fire in response,'' Ndahiro said.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.N. agencies are evacuating non-essential
expatriate staff from Bukavu because of the deteriorating
situation there.
</P>
<P>
``There is a plan to evacuate non-essential expatriate staff
from Bukavu. We have sent recommendations to headquarters and we
are awaiting a response,'' Fernando Del Mundo, spokesman for the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said.

<HEADLINE> Reception of Dalai Lama to Affect Sino-Australian Ties: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Shen Guofang said here today that the Australian
Government's reception of the Dalai Lama would have an impact on
Sino-Australian relations.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference this afternoon, Shen said that China has
"stressed time after time that the Dalai Lama is more a political
figure in exile than a religious one, who engages himself in
activities aiming at splitting China."
</P>
<P>
The reception and meetings between Australian government
leaders and the Dalai have constituted "an interference in China's
internal affairs," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
This will surely cast a shadow over Sino-Australian relations
by affecting bilateral political relations, he said, adding that
it is also unavoidable to affect trade relations.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes that the Australian government can adopt a
correct attitude towards the issue and will not interfere in
China's internal affairs.

CHENGDU, September 24 (Xinhua) -- A team of adventurers are
retracing a drift along China's longest river which ended
tragically ten years ago when five people were killed.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 team is composed of more than ten adventurers,
scientists and reporters. They have left Chengdu, capital of
southwest China's Sichuan Province, on their high-risk drift up
the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The journey is marking the 10th anniversary of the first
drifting adventure on the river in 1986, when five members of an
adventure team were killed after scoring many scientific
achievements during their perilous drift.
</P>
<P>
To memorize the glorious event and encourage more young people
to take part in scientific adventures, relevant departments of the
province organized the current team to re-visit the origin and
upper reaches of the Yangtze river, which is the third longest in
the world.
</P>
<P>
The adventure will cover more than 8,000 kilometers, and mainly
focus on the relationship between mankind and the ecological
environment. It is hoped the journey will inspire people to gain
more understanding of the river and the western part of China in
particular.
</P>
<P>
Adventure study of the ecological environment is becoming a
popular pastime in China, but it is very risky due to geographic
dangers.

deficit skyrocketed to 15.24 billion U.S. dollars in the first
eight months of this year, more than doubling the 7.33 billion

3.49 billion dollars, a record monthly high this year.
</P>
<P>
Such a huge deficit results from rapid increase in imports,
extravagant spending at home and abroad, and a slash in prices
of such major export items as semiconductors, a bank official said.
</P>
<P>
The current account comprises trade in goods and services as
well as investment income and government payments.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Central Bank's
number one concern is now the country's growing trade deficit
along with high inflation, a senior bank official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a monetary conference, central bank Governor
Gabriel Singson said that the monetary authorities is no longer
worried about the country's foreign exchange rate, but about
external trade balance and price stability.
</P>
<P>
"The trade deficit is a concern. We don't deny it," Singson
said.
</P>
<P>
For the first half of this year, the Philippines' foreign trade
deficit amounted to 6 billion US dollars, representing an increase
of 40 percent from last year. It widened further to 7.1 billion
dollars in July this year.
</P>
<P>
Singson said that the International Monetary Fund is urging the
Philippine government to take measures to curb the nation's
widening trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
The nation's inflation also takes a great part of the bank's
concern, though it dropped to 7.9 percent last month from a peak
of 11.3 percent in September 1995, Singson said.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Chief Expresses His World Cup Worry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Secretary general Joseph
S. Blatter of FIFA, world soccer governing body, Tuesday in Zurich
expressed his personal worry to get the South Korean and Japanese
organizers of the World Cup 2002 together.
</P>
<P>
In an interview given to the Neue Zurcher Zeitung after the
voters of the city of Zurich had approved a land-lease agreement
allowing FIFA to expand its headquarters, Blatter said the
approving votes showed that "FIFA is very popular in Zurich."
</P>
<P>
But It might be less popular on Seoul and Tokyo, he hinted.
</P>
<P>
"Representatives from the two national federations were here
last week, on separate visits. It is very difficult to get the two
parties together. The first meeting is scheduled for November
6. They have diametrically opposing ideas about co-hosting the
World Cup," a report quoted Blatter as saying.
</P>
<P>
Blatter said that the two parties had taken part in informal
talks, but that the meeting was quickly over.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that it was "out of the question" that FIFA
would go back on its decision and award the tournament to a third
country.
</P>
<P>
The secretary general also said that it was highly unlikely
that one of the two nations would withdraw.

<HEADLINE> Iran Asks for More Aids to Iraqi Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government has
asked for more relief assistance to the Iraqi Kurdish refugees
being sheltered in three Iranian provinces.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry said in a statement published in local
press today that the aid given by the United Nations is not
enough and the refugees will soon face new problems as the cold
season is approaching.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said
last week that it had granted an aid of 3.08 million U.S. dollars
to cover the basic needs of some 40,000 new Iraqi Kurdish
refugees for a span of three months.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government expressed thanks to the UNHCR for its
relief assistance. But it said that three million dollars given by
the organization is only a fraction of what Iran has already spent
on refugees.
</P>
<P>
It said that the U.N. relief assistance is far from sufficient
in meeting the massive needs of some 60,000 refugees, who would
have to suffer cold and rainy season soon.
</P>
<P>
Iran said that it has spent more than 25 billion rials
(about 6 million dollars) on sheltering Kurdish refugees from
northern Iraq.

NANJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- A new expressway linking
Shanghai with Nanjing is expected to boost the economy along the
route by 25 percent, market analysts estimated.
</P>
<P>
The road, which shortens travel hour between the two major
Chinese cities to three hours from previous nine hours, traverses
some of China's richest cities including Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou
and Zhenjiang in the Yangtze River Delta.
</P>
<P>
Existing expressways and others still under construction are

high-grade national roads, leading as far north as Beijing,
northernmost Heilongjiang Province.
</P>

The route is only part of a national express highway network
with a total length of more than 3,000 kilometers. Before 1990,
the country only had 522 kilometers of express highway.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Thwarts Israeli Penetration in Lebanon (by Shao Jie) (I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Guerrillas of the Lebanese
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, announced today that they
thwarted an infiltrating attempt by Israeli troops in an
Israeli-occupied border strip at midnight.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued this morning, the Hezbollah guerrillas
said that an Israeli force went down stealthly its position on the
hill of Souida and advanced towards the guerrilla base of Habboush
at Iglim Al-Toffah, a ridge opposite the so-called "security zone."
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas blocked the Israeli troops by showering them hails
of bullets from various weapons, and the fighting lasted until
dawn, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Israel's artillery shelled sporadically over the night and
earlier in the morning around Iglim Al-Toffah, which is oftened
used by guerrillas as a springboard for launching attacks at the
Israeli occupation forces in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The bombardments were accompanied by reconnaissance flights of
Israeli helicopters over the area.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas also announced that they carried out an
attack at a position of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army
militia at Tomat Niha in the buffer zone Monday, "killing and
wounding a number of militiamen."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli client militia confirmed that eight mortar shells
were fired by the guerrillas at its position, but denied any
casualties.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the night clash, the tensions in south
Lebanon, which had shrouded the area since last Thursday, was
considerably eased Monday following contacts by Washington
with parties concerned, according to diplomatic sources in
Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berri, following his meeting with
President Elias Hrawi Monday, noted that the tension in south
Lebanon was only created by the Jewish state in order "to press
for financial and military aid from the United States."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Lebanese army was continuing sending
more reinforcements to the southern part of Beqaa Valley in
eastern Lebanon and strengthening positions in the area in
preparation for possible Israeli attacks.

<TEXT>
<P>
Security sources said that the Lebanese army sent hundreds of
commandos Monday to Western Beqaa to reinforce the army troops
already there.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese army sent a reinforcement of some 2,000 troops
backed by tanks and armored personnel carriers to the area on the
weekend, a move carried out "by coordination" with Syria's
35,000-strong forces in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Syria has redeployed about one third of its troops in Lebanon
from Beirut and its suburbs to the range of mountains on the
Lebanese-Syrian border in the past few weeks in view of
repeated Israeli threats of strike in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a five-nation committee monitoring
a cease-fire between Lebanon and Israel is to resume its meeting
in a south Lebanese border town this morning to discuss
complaints lodged by Lebanon and the Jewish state against each
other.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was called by Lebanon to discuss two complaints it
filed to the committee, accusing Israel of violating the
cease-fire by shelling southern Lebanon's villages Thursday and
deporting two Lebanese families from a border strip occupied by
the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Israel also complained to the committee that guerrillas of
Lebanon's pro-Iranian Hezobllah fired on its forces from three
civilian-inhabited villages in the area that day.
</P>
<P>
After a four-hour session at Naqura Sunday, the cease-fire
monitoring committee grouping the United States, France, Israel,
Lebanon and Syria adjourned the meeting because of the Jewish holy
day of Yom Kippur.
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth meeting of the cease-fire monitoring
committee, but the first at Lebanon's request. The previous
three meetings were called by Israel.
</P>
<P>
The committee was set up under a cease-fire understanding
brokered by the United States between Lebanon and Israel, which
put an end to a 17-day Israeli blitz against Hezbollah,
and which is aimed at protecting civilians on both sides from
any military activities.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Russia Make Missile Defense Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher and his Russian counterpart Yevgeny Primakov
announced a defense agreement on Monday clarifying the legality of
certain American weapons used to defend against slower-flying
ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
The accord was reached during their 3 1/2-hour meeting at a New
York hotel. Christopher hailed it as a "milestone."
</P>
<P>
"This important progress assures that we can effectively defend
against theater ballistic missiles while ensuring the integrity of
the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty," Christopher said Monday after
meeting with Primakov.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said the accord will have a "significant, positive
effect" on debate in the Russian Duma, the national legislature,
on ratifying the START II nuclear arms reduction treaty which the
U.S. Congress has already ratified.
</P>
<P>
Lynn Davis, a State Department official, told reporters later
that Christopher and Primakov had confirmed a detailed agreement
worked out in June and that they expect the documents to be
formally signed by the end of October.
</P>
<P>
In practical terms, Ms. Davis said, the accord clarifies the
legality of a new-generation anti-missile system under development
by the Pentagon called the Theater High Altitude Area Defense
system, which is designed to shoot down incoming ballistic
missiles at far greater ranges than the Patriot is capable of.
</P>
<P>
The deal applies to those anti-missile missiles that fly at
speeds no greater than 3 kilometers per second. Discussions on
faster-flying missiles will be the next step.
</P>
<P>
Washington and Moscow have argued for years over identifying
those anti-missile defensive systems, such as the U.S. Army's
Patriot air defense system, that are allowed under the 1972 ABM
Treaty and those capable of shooting down long-range missiles,
which are expressly limited under the treaty.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, the two senior diplomats also discussed
Russia's relations with NATO, the Bosnian elections and the
situation in Iraq, but reached no new agreements on NATO's
expansion plans.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Education Ministry Lacks Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The annual budgetary
allocation to the Ministry of Education is still inadequate to
build schools, Zimbabwean Education Minister Edmund Garwe said
yesterday in Bulawayo, the country's second largest city.
</P>
<P>
Garwe said the 460 million U.S. Dollars allocated to the
ministry this year would not satisfy the needs of the
ever-existing local education system.
</P>
<P>
He said of the 460 million Dollars for 1996/97, 92 percent
went to salaries of more than 100,000 teachers and other staff.
</P>
<P>
"Four percent goes to administration and the remainder is for
development but it is just too little to build new schools. From
this money we have allocated 1.8 million U.S. Dollars to assist
advanced level schools which are mostly privately run," said
Garwe.
</P>
<P>
He said the ministry could afford to build more schools if
about 20 percent of its allocation was for development.
</P>
<P>
"Right now we urgently need to build 38 secondary schools to
cater for close to 40,000 children who cannot be accommodated on
existing schools. Bulawayo alone needs 10 secondary schools but
there is no money," said Garwe.

<HEADLINE> Iran Warns of Conflict with US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran has warned that it will
conflict with the United States throughout the Persian Gulf up
to the Sea of Oman if it is attacked.
</P>
<P>
Major General Mohsen Rezaee, Commander of the Islamic
Revolution Guards Corps, said "if the slightest problem breaks
out for us or the slightest pressure is exerted on us, we will
disregard all restrictions and become engaged in conflict with
the U.S. throughout the Persian Gulf up to the Sea of Oman,
making them repent their deeds."
</P>
<P>
The strong-worded statement by the Iranian major general was
carried on the frontpage of today's English-language daily Tehran
Times.
</P>
<P>
Rezaee said that if Americans were sure that "they could wage
a war against us in a limited framework, and readily bring us
under their control, they would have so far done so."
</P>
<P>
"But they well know that if they did so, we would extend the
war, making them repent," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Americans strive to keep the region
insecure and tension-ridden in order to rationalize their
presence in the region, and at times threaten Iran, but their
threats are empty.
</P>
<P>
"Americans know that if the slightest incident occurs in the
region, it may lead to a massive war, which might spill over
other places, with the Americans losing the game." he said.
</P>
<P>
As to the Israeli threat to Iran, he said, Israel has been
confronting Iran for the past five or six years. "If Israel
wants to take action against us, it will use its air force, and
in response we will not restrict ourselves to the air. We will
decide where and how to respond to Israel."
</P>
<P>
The commander said that "What is certain is we have prepared
ourselves for these threats and any confrontation."
</P>
<P>
However, he ruled out the possibility of an all-out war in
the region, saying that none of the regional countries are now
ready for a big war.
</P>
<P>
"Given the economic, political and social situation in the
region, the outbreak of such a war is unlikely," he added.
</P>
<P>
"If the U.S. does not intervene in the region and the
regional countries become united, no incident will occur in the
region," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian commander rejected claims that the growth of
Iran's military build-up and defensive capabilities pose a
threat to regional countries.
</P>
<P>
"We have never waged war against any country, nor will we do
so except against aggressors," he said. "our power is a
deterrent to aggressors."
</P>
<P>
He said that "we believe that the growth of our defensive
capabilities will not be a threat to others. We will not employ
this power in a way that would be detrimental to others."

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM to Visit Libya, Nigeria, Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan is expected to make his second foreign trip to
Egypt, Libya and Nigeria between October 2 and 8, local newspaper
Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
Turkish sources said that the Western countries worry about
Erbakan's visit to Libya and Nigeria, both black-listed by the
West, so the visit will be seen as a sign of further
anti-Western defiance by Turkey's Islamist prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Libya is currently facing international sanctions for not
turning in two men suspected of involvement in the bombing of a
Pan Am passenger jet over Lockerbie in 1988, killing all
aboard.
</P>
<P>
Turkey also has its own problems with Libya concerning a debt
of 300 million U.S. dollars Libya owes to Turkish contracting
companies for work done in that country.
</P>
<P>
Turkish State Ministers Abdullah Gul and Namik Kemal Zeybek
visited Libya only a few weeks ago, but failed to secure any
results concerning the money owed to Turkish contractors.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan's other destination is also facing international
sanctions for the coup carried out by its current military
strong-man Sanni Abacha.
</P>
<P>
On his first visit abroad in August, Erbakan visited Iran,
Pakistan, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish prime minister signed a multi-billion dollar
natural gas deal with Iran at a time when the United States
announced that it would try and punish companies from other
countries that invested in Iran's oil and gas industry.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Chongqing, Bridge Between China's East, West (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city has made strong efforts to build up a sound and
complete market system. Up to now, a large number of markets of
various kinds have been set up. These include large malls for farm
products, building materials and daily commodities, as well as for
futures, securities, labor, foreign exchange, technology and
information.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, Chongqing City had 200,000 commercial
institutions, with a total staff of 500,000. Meanwhile, the city
hosts a dozen national or regional trade fairs annually.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Chongqing has become a regional commercial center,
with consumer goods sales reaching 28.1 billion yuan in 1995,
ranking the second in Yangtze River area, following Shanghai, and
the sixth in the country.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the city has also made efforts to strengthen
its financial and banking capability through developing its
banking industry.
</P>
<P>
So far, the city has over 3,000 banking institutions, including
nine engaged in international business. The Chongqing Branch of
Bank of China has become the largest foreign exchange market in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The development of Chongqing has brought positive effects to
neighboring areas. One of the city's industrial pillars, the
automotive industry, is an example. The industry realized 20
billion yuan in sales in 1995, while 50 percent of automobile
parts and accessories were supplied by enterprises in neighboring
areas.
</P>
<P>
In the Three Gorges Dam Area, except Chongqing itself, nearly
200 companies are making parts and fittings for the city's
manufacturers of automobiles and motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese economists have predicted that in the coming 15
years, Chongqing will become one of the most active economic areas
in the country, and will function as a bridge between the
developed eastern region and underdeveloped western part of
China.

<P>
CHONGQING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing has been an water
transportation and commercial hub in southwest China for at least
500 years.
</P>
<P>
Today, this most populous city in the country has emerged to be
the largest, most active economic center in the southwest, as well
as in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River Economic Zone.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese hold that Chongqing, which is at the junction
between the developed east China and the underdeveloped western
region, and between the Yangtze River area and the southwestern
economic zone, is playing the greatest-ever regional role in the
country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Over the past dozen years, the central government has shown
special care and has made various efforts to push forward the
economic progress of the inland industrial metropolis.
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Chongqing was declared the country's first city to
pilot comprehensive reforms and was granted provincial-level
economic power.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, Chongqing was listed among cities along the Yangtze
River to enjoy the same open policies as coastal open cities. Two
years later the State Council announced the Three Gorges Dam Area,
with Chongqing as its center, the Three Gorges Economic Open Zone.
</P>
<P>
Top state leaders, including President Jiang Zemin and Premier
Li Peng, have paid visits to Chongqing, encouraging it to play a
regional central role to boost the economy of the whole area.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has missed no opportunity to
strengthen regional economic cooperation and has invested heavily
in infrastructure. During 1991-95 period, its infrastructural
investment exceeded 30 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing now has three major railway lines, eight river ports,
and over 40 air routes to other parts of the country. The city's
water navigational link with Shanghai enables its shipping fleet
to reach the oceans, while its air transportation network can
transport passengers to any part of the country and the world.
</P>
<P>
The telecommunication sector has grown substantially in recent
few years, with a million telephone lines connected to everywhere
in the world.

<P>
A recent study by the NSCP regarding extra expenses resulting
from price increases, including bread price hikes, demonstrated
that the additional expenses various families have to be burdened
averages 32.2 dollars, according to today's Jordan Times, the
kingdom's sole English daily.
</P>
<P>
NSCP President Homhammad Obeidat said that the average income
of the surveyed families, with an average of seven members each,
was 175 dinars (about 225 dollars).
</P>
<P>
He said that some families who earn less than 175 dinars have
been badly affected and that such families pay up to 10 percent
of their income to cover the rise of bread price.
</P>
<P>
The government lifted the subsidies on bread last month, which
triggered the so-called "bread riots" in the southern part of the
country.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Passes 1997 Budget Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean cabinet
adopted today a budget bill scaled at 87 billion U.S. dollars for
the next year, up 13.7 percent from that for this year.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which calls for a 13.5-percent increase in per capita
tax burden to 2,500 dollars, will be signed by President Kim
Young-sam and then submitted to the National Assembly for its
deliberation by October 2.
</P>
<P>
The general-account budget is set at 82.36 billion dollars and
the special-account budget at 4.64 billion, representing increases
of 12.8 percent and 33.9 percent respectively over those for this
year.
</P>
<P>
On the revenue side, tax revenue will rise 14.6 percent to
78.04 billion dollars, but non-tax revenues such as stock sales
proceeds will decrease 12.5 percent to 4.31 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 budget reflects the government's belt-tightening
measures stemming from a slowing economy and increased investment
in infrastructure expansion projects, according to Finance and
Economy Ministry officials.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's defense expenditures for the next year will be
raised by 12 percent to 17.34 billion dollars, the biggest raise

<HEADLINE> Western Politicians Criticized for Meeting Dalai Lama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- A signed article released by
Xinhua today has criticized a number of politicians in the West
for regarding the Dalai Lama as a "distinguished guest" and
meeting with him.
</P>
<P>
The article by Li Rong said that since the beginning of this
year, the Dalai Lama has visited Australia, Japan, New Zealand and
the United States to preach his fallacy of "independence of
Tibet," in an attempt to internationalize the Tibet question.
</P>
<P>
"What he has done has laid bare his ugly face of seeking power
and wealth by betraying his motherland," it said.
</P>
<P>
For such a splittist who is bent on sabotaging China's
unification, however, some politicians in the West lauded him as a
"distinguished guest", met him and hosted private dinners in honor
of him.
</P>
<P>
Recently, an Australian politician went so far as to laud the
Dalai Lama as a "religious leader."
</P>
<P>
"What kind of person is the Dalai Lama?" the article asked.
</P>
<P>
It said that Dalai has been in exile and stuck to his
reactionary stand of betraying the motherland since an armed
rebellion in Tibet launched by him was crushed in 1959.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, instigated by some foreign forces,
Dalai has resorted to all kinds of activities to split China by
stirring up riots in Tibet and begging foreigners for support.
</P>
<P>
The article noted, "plenty of facts have demonstrated that
Dalai is the chieftain of the splittist clique attempting to seek
independence of Tibet, a chessman of the global anti-China forces
and the root for creating social disturbance in Tibet."
</P>
<P>
All far-sighted people all over the world have drawn a line of
distinction between themselves and Dalai, a conspirator who has
been engaged in activities to split China under the cloak of
religion.
</P>
<P>
But certain Australian politicians have not done so, it said.
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, they stated repeatedly that they pursue
the 'one China' policy. On the other hand, they asserted that
meeting with the Dalai Lama does not mean that they support
independence of Tibet, adding that this is their concept of values.
</P>
<P>
Such a concept of values means one's deeds do not match one's
words," the article said, noting: "This is really absurd."
</P>
<P>
The reason some Australian politicians, with ulterior motives,
did the absurd thing of meeting with Dalai despite the Chinese
government's serious warning, is that they refuse to abandon their
intention of interfering in China's internal affairs, the article
concluded.

<HEADLINE> New Drug Detector to Be Used at Kuala Lumpur Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Kuala Lumpur
International Airport in Subang near here will be equipped with a
new device capable of detecting various drugs, according to a
senior official of the National Narcotics Agency (NNA) today.
</P>
<P>
The device -- Vapor Detector and Analyzer -- is very sensitive
in detecting drugs including Ecstasy and explosives hidden in
suitcases and this will enhance the authorities' ability to foil
smuggling attempts, NNA Director General Yaacob Mohamed Amin said.
</P>
<P>
The device is part of an American grant in combating drug
problems in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Yaacob was quoted by the Malaysian national news agency Bernama
as saying that the NNA was aware that the country was being used
as a transit point by traffickers to smuggle drugs from the Golden
Triangle to other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
He said recent arrests made by the authorities at the airport
confirmed this.
</P>
<P>
On September 15, two Singaporeans on their way to Jakarta were
held at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport while trying to get
away with 11,000 Ecstasy pills.
</P>
<P>
Yaacob said drug abuse was an international problem and
tremendous effort was being made by the Malaysian government to
tackle it.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Fu Quanyou, chief of the
general staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), held
talks today with Zimbabwean Defence Forces Commander Musungwa Gava
Zvinavashe.
</P>
<P>
Fu said that China treasures the long-term friendship between
people of the two countries and development of friendly

He said at the meeting in Beijing: "There is a profound
friendship between the Chinese and Zimbabwean armed forces. We are
willing to make joint efforts with Zimbabwean armed forces to
develop the friendly co-operative relations between the two
armies, based on equality and mutual benefit."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government unswervingly pursues the independent
diplomatic policy of peace. It is one of the basic points of the
Chinese foreign policy to strengthen unity and co-operation with
African countries and other developing countries, Fu said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chinese President Jiang Zemin's successful visit
to six African countries last May, including Zimbabwe, was of
great historic significance. He added that China supports all
African countries establishing their own political systems, ways
of development and values, based on their respective conditions,
and supports them to solve regional conflicts independently and
peacefully, and to increasingly and equally involve themselves in
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Zvinavashe thanked the Chinese government for the selfless aid
to Zimbabwe in its struggles for national liberation, and its
economic development after independence.

<P>
Zvinavashe reiterated that Zimbabwean government adheres to
"one China" stance, and recognizes Taiwan as an inalienable part
of China's territory.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed general Fu on the situation of Zimbabwe and
southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Before the talks, Fu hosted a welcome ceremony in his honor.

<P>
Bagmahalla Village was lucky enough to be included in the
campaign, and since the beginning of this year, technical workers
have been constructing the necessary basic facilities. These
included the installation of 50 sets of household electricity
supply units, one central power supply system, as well as building
a ground satellite receiving station, and a power-driven water
intake mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Villagers became so excited on drinking clean water following
the availability of electricity in the village that they all
gathered together under bright electric lamps, singing and dancing
till the next day.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have selected another four similar backwater
villages after finishing the work in Bagmahalla. Like Bagmahalla,
the four poor areas will also say good-bye to the days without
electricity.
</P>
<P>
French experts working in the cooperation project say that
Xinjiang has rich solar energy resources and is an ideal area for
turning solar energy into electricity. Each year some 2,300 hours
to 3,500 hours of high-value sunshine can be harnessed each year.
</P>
<P>
Up to the end of last year, electricity had been available in
all counties of Xinjiang thanks to the help from the central
government, but some 500,000 households still can not use
electricity.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that the Bagmahalla experience shows that
compared with building big power grids, using solar energy to
generate electricity can cut costs by two-thirds.

in the Turpan Basin.
</P>
<P>
Each of the 200 households in the village have been supplied
with free TV sets, courtesy of local government departments.
</P>
<P>
And the village toasted the arrival of electricity by drinking
fresh clean water, again thanks to sun-generated power. They
danced all night long to say farewell to their 'dark age'
existence, illuminated only by kerosene lamps.
</P>
<P>
The transformation came about with the implementation of a
Sino-French cooperation project to use sunlight to generate
electricity.
</P>
<P>
Newly converted TV fan Niyaz said: "I like watching Mikamu -- a
sort of ballad popular among people of Uygur background --
programs most, and next comes general news broadcasts."
</P>
<P>
Bagmahalla used to be one of the remote poverty-stricken
villages in the Turpan Basin, where electricity was not available.
</P>
<P>
Until this summer the Uygur farmers of Bagmahalla used kerosene
at night for lighting, and young people had to ride long distances
in mule-driven carts to watch films or TV programs in neighboring
villages.
</P>
<P>
The French energy foundation signed an agreement to cooperate
with the Xinjiang Energy Institute at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, both sides are jointly building solar
energy-turned-electricity in villages within a time span of 26
months. They selected remote ethnic inhabited areas where no
electricity has ever been available, with the French side
providing technical and equipment aid.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Changes in Stance on Salman Rushdie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Ministry has
issued a statement, denying any change in its stance regarding the
death sentence on British author Salman Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
The statement, published in today's Persian daily Jumhuri
Islami, said that Iran's stance toward the Indian-born British
author of the Satanic Verses is the same as previously stated in
Iran's negotiations with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry issued the statement in a response to an
article in western media, which revealed that Iran and the EU had
reached 95 percent of an agreement on the Rushdie issue. The
article claimed that Iran would make a written guarantee not to
kill Rushdie in European countries.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the decree issued by the late
spiritual leader Imam Khomeini on Rushdie is "unchangeable."
</P>
<P>
"But as previously agreed upon, Iran would not send
commandos to execute the order," it said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that "what have appeared in some western media in the
past few days are nothing more than a ploy against the Islamic
Republic of Iran."
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry called on Iranian people to be very
vigilant as regards what they read or see in the media.
</P>
<P>
On February 14, 1989, the late Iranian leader Ayatollah
Khomeini issued a religious edict, pronouncing a sentence of
death on Rushdie and his publishers in protest against the
publication of Rushdie's novel The Satanic Verses, and exhorting
all Moslems to carry out the sentence.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Rushdie issue has turned into a big
controversial problem that hinders the relations between Iran
and European countries.
</P>
<P>
However, Iranian authorities have given in to tremendous
pressures from the European Union after the death of Khomeini,
promising not to dispatch any commandos to kill Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati has pledged that Iran
would not send anyone to kill Rushdie. Similar assurances have
been given to European Union by President Hashemi Rafsanjani and
Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri.

<HEADLINE> China Donates New Trolley Buses to Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 24 (Xinhua) -- China today handed over a
fleet of 10 trolley buses to the Nepali capital of Kathmandu under
an aid program to help upgrade the city's trolley transport
system.
</P>
<P>
The 10 new buses, worth about 800,000 US dollars, are expected
to significantly improve the service of the 13 kilometer long
trolley routes established in 1974 with 22 buses under a Chinese
assistance project.
</P>
<P>
The new buses, each with a full carrying capacity of 100
passengers, were handed over to the Nepal Transport Corporation at
a ceremony attended by Nepali Transport Minister Bijaya Gachhadar
and Chinese ambassador to Nepal Zhang Jiuhuan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Gachhadar said that as the air
pollution problem worsens in Kathmandu due to the rapid
urbanization, the trolley bus service has become a non-pollutive
alternative to relieve the ever increasing pressure of public
transport in the city.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed thanks to the Chinese government for its
cooperation in helping develop and improve the trolley system in
the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Nepal transport corporation, which has
operated the Kathmandu trolley system since its establishment 22
years ago, said that the trolley system has been providing
reliable and continuous service and is popular among the city
commuters.
</P>
<P>
About 425,000 commuters use the trolley service every month,
according to the officials.

as part of a 15 year plan to boost its share of overseas contracts.
</P>
<P>
The city has announced an expansion of its overseas labor
services and construction cooperation, with an increase of 10 to
15 percent annually, a top municipal official said.

<P>
He said by the year 2000, the total turnover of overseas labor
services is expected to reach up to 600 million US dollars, and by
1.4 billion US dollars by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
A number of effective measures are to be taken to achieve the
goal, said Yi Xiqun, director of the Beijing Municipal Foreign
Trade Commission. The most important is to extend overseas
contracts and labor services in accordance with international
standards.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, Beijing had signed contracts for overseas
projects and labor services totaling 2.57 billion US dollar, with
a turnover of 1.13 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
More than 20,000 doctors, scientists and engineers have been
sent to over 50 countries and regions around the world, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
A total 11 enterprises in the city have now been licensed to
enjoy the right to sign overseas contracts for labor services.
</P>
<P>
Among them, the Beijing Urban and Rural Construction Group Co
is the biggest, he said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the city signed contracts for overseas cooperative
projects and labor services worth 780 million US dollars, earning
millions of dollars in profits for China.

<HEADLINE> Asian Food Technology Show Opens in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The third Asian Food
Processing and Packaging '96 (AFPP '96) incorporating Asian food
technology '96 Exhibition (AFT '96) Opened here today.
</P>
<P>
AFPP/AFT '96 is Malaysia's premier food processing-related
exhibition covering a comprehensive spectrum of food processing
and packaging equipment, machinery and technology.
</P>
<P>
Officiating the opening of the four-day show, Malaysian
Agriculture Minister Sulaiman Daud said efforts would need to be
directed at upgrading food processing technology; encouraging
higher automation; improving food quality, safety and health
standards as well as products design and packaging to ensure the
food industry remains competitive.
</P>
<P>
He said the growth of sophisticated consumers subsequently
translate into greater emphasis for product diversification, the
development of convenient food, upgrading of nutritive value and
food safety, and the development of special food for specialized
health needs.
</P>
<P>
On the Malaysian food market, he said it was already valued at
22 billion ringgit (about 8.63 billion US dollars) in 1995 and the
industry is projected to grow by 10 to 15 percent per annum.
</P>
<P>
He said that by the year 2000, the food processing market of
the country alone is expected to be worth more than 10 billion
ringgit (about 4 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
As Malaysia's export of processed food products increases, with
growth from 812 million ringgit (about 318 million US dollars) in
1986 to 2.41 billion ringgit (about 945 million US dollars) in
1994, it will not only face increasing competition but also
barriers in the form of health regulations and other trade
challenges, he said.
</P>
<P>
To meet these challenges, he said entrepreneurs must strive for
higher standards of hygiene in processing, packaging, cold-storage
transportation and refrigeration through using sophisticated
processing techniques including those found in food biotechnology,
membrane technology, extrusion technology, ultra-high temperature
technology, ultra-high pressure technology and electro-heat
technology, etc.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition serves to boost the rapid growth of the food
processing and packaging industry in Malaysia and in the region
and aims to provide an excellent opportunity for both Malaysian
and foreign investors to undertake business collaboration,
organizers at the show said.
</P>
<P>
Over 150 exhibitors representing some 20 countries and regions
are displaying their products and technology at the biennial
event.

BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- China's capital Beijing
basked in its hottest late September for 61 years, with
yesterday's temperature reaching 32.5 degrees centigrade.
</P>
<P>
It was the second highest late September temperature in
Beijing since 1915 when the city started its own records of

</P>
<P>
Yesterday's high was only 0.2 degrees centigrade lower than the
highest recorded temperature in the city on September 22, 1935.
</P>
<P>
Meteorological experts contributed the hot weather to high
pressure which has been controlling the area since last
weekend. Due to the warm air mass, Beijing has been clear, less
windy and enjoyed much sunshine.
</P>
<P>
Weather forecasters said today's highest temperature would be
29 degrees centigrade. Meteorological experts estimated a drop in
temperature tomorrow, as a cold current is moving toward Beijing
from central Mongolia.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Praises Reporters Who Help Fight Copyright Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- China's State Copyright
Administration today rewarded 50 reporters who have helped fight
copyright piracy over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The reporters work for Xinhua News Agency, "The People's
Daily", China Central Television, and many other news
organizations throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
"Mass media is playing a major role in promoting people's
awareness of copyright protection," said Yu Youxian, director of
the administration.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese media has published tens of thousands
of stories to demonstrate the significance of copyright protection
and spread information in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Many people reported copyright cases to the authorities after
reading newspapers, according to Shen Rengan, deputy director of
the administration. He added that it was unusual for a country to
mobilize all its public sectors, including the media, to engage in
the fight against copyright piracy.
</P>
<P>
Yu Youxian explained that the improvement of people's legal
sense by making use of the media has become a basic guarantee to
implement the copyright law.
</P>
<P>
The prize-winning stories themselves are a showcase that China
has achieved great progress in protecting copyright, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He cited some articles, including one describing how farmers
become familiar with the copyright law, one about the Walt
Disney's case in Beijing, and another on copyright protection in a
fast food restaurant.
</P>
<P>
Some reporters lashed the US for its unfair charge that China
violated foreign copyrights. One journalist even told a story
about a senior Chinese copyright official whose works were pirated
in the US without authorization.

<HEADLINE> Atlantis Undocks from Mir for Ride Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. space shuttle
Atlantis undocked from Russian space station Mir today, ending the
five-day joint operations and picking up woman astronaut Shannon
Lucid back for the ride home.
</P>
<P>
The two spacecraft separated slowly while flying over European
mountain region at 9:33 p.m. EDT, right on time as scheduled.
About two hours later, commander Bill Readdy will fire Atlantis'
engines to move quickly from Mir for the final time until Atlantis
returns to the Russian station next January for another docking.
</P>
<P>
The nine astronauts and cosmonauts finished final transfer
activities and verified the inventory lists of materials Sunday
night. More than one ton of water was transferred from Atlantis
to Mir, along with logistical supplies, food and scientific
hardware.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before 6 a.m. EDT today, the crew gathered in the Core
Module of the Russian space station for a formal good-bye.
</P>
<P>
Lucid gave her colleagues aboard Mir a farewell embrace and
then floated into shuttle Atlantis, the hatch between the two
spacecraft closed behind her at about 8 a.m. EDT, concluding five
days of joint operations.
</P>
<P>
"I'm really happy and I also feel just a little sad," said
Lucid, who holds the space endurance record for a woman and an
American. The 53-year-old biochemist spent seven more weeks in
space than planned because Atlantis' trip was delayed by its
booster rockets problem and two hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
Atlantis' landing remains scheduled for Kennedy Space Center on
Thursday at about 8:12 a.m.

<HEADLINE> Anticipatory Bail Granted to Son of Bangladeshi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The high court of Bangladesh
has granted a two-month anticipatory bail to former prime minister
Khaleda Zia's son, Tareq Rahman, and some others charged with
different corruption cases, court sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
A division bench of the high court Monday also issued a ruling
directing the government to show cause within four weeks as to why
the petitioners should not be enlarged on an anticipatory bail.
</P>
<P>
The ruling of the court came after three day's of hearing of
the petition beginning on Saturday seeking anticipatory bail to
avoid arrest and police harassment.
</P>
<P>
The court granted similar anticipatory bail to Khaleda Zia's
brother Iskander Ali and three former ministers of her cabinet who
were implicated in separate corruption cases lodged by the
Anti-corruption Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The bureau on September 16 charged that the Dandy Dying
company, owned by Tareq Rahman and Iskander Ali, had obtained a
loan of about four million US dollars from a state-owned bank
illegally by abusing the power of the then prime minister Khaleda
Zia.
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyer Moudud Ahmed argued that the corruption case
lodged by the government was in a bid to tarnish the image of the
incumbent opposition leader Khaleda Zia, who was defeated in the
June 12 parliamentary elections.

<HEADLINE> More Banks Closed in Bulgaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Nine more Bulgarian banks were
closed and will be given special supervision and management by the
central bank, the management council of the People's Bank of
Bulgaria, announced today.
</P>
<P>
It is the second time this year for Bulgaria to declare the
possible bankruptcy of commercial banks. Bulgaria declared the
closure of two banks last May.
</P>
<P>
Special supervision and management means that the central bank
will send supervisory officials to those banks, stop their
businesses and clear up their debts. Once the central bank decides
that they have lost their paying ability, it will declare to the
courts their applications of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
The central bank also said today that the yearly interest rate
and the monthly rate of the bank would rise respectively to 300
percent and 25 percent. It also suggested that commercial banks
raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank explained that this measure was designed to
minimize the effect of inflation on people's lives.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian Prime Minister Zhan Videnov hailed the central bank's
decision. He said on state television tonight that these timely
and necessary measures would help stabilize the country's
financial systems.
</P>
<P>
Georgi Petkov, director of the central bank's Lev Business
Department, told reporters that the purpose of raising interest
rates was to withdraw currency from circulation. The high rates
might indicate the coming of serious inflation, said Petkov.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's inflation rate has surpassed, since the beginning of
this year, the current yearly interest rate of 108 percent of the
People's Bank. And the rate of exchange between the Lev and
U.S. dollars has changed from 70 to 1 in the middle of this year
to 240 to 1 now.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Air Force Denies Drug-Plant Involvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian air force today
denied that it had helped place the heroin found on the
presidential plane Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing could be more illusory and unreal" than these
allegations, Air Force Commander General Hernando Gil said today.
</P>
<P>
The air force considered the finding of 3.7 kilograms of heroin
in the presidential aircraft "deplorable," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the anonymous phone call that led authorities to discover
the drug in the nose of plane, Gil said that the call was received
after the inspection of the craft by air force security had begun.
</P>
<P>
Taking the notification seriously, the process was expedited
with the support of intelligence teams and anti-narcotic dogs, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The heroin would have been located anyway, even if there had
not been such a call, he added.
</P>
<P>
The heroin was found in the plane in which President Ernesto
Samper was due to fly to New York to attend the 51st U.N. General
Assembly session.

<P>
PYONGYANG, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The armed forces of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea have demanded that Seoul
"immediately and unconditionally" return to DPRK its submarine
which drift about to the South side due to an engine trouble.
</P>
<P>
The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) Monday quoted a spokesman
of the Ministry of the People's Armed Forces as saying that "a
training small submarine of a Korean People's Army unit, which
left Won San port on September 13 and engaged in a routine
training on the north's East Sea of Korean, might drift about with
an engine trouble and strike a rock on the sea off Kangrung."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said, "it seemed that its crew were left with no
other choice but to get to the enemy side's land, which might
cause an armed conflict."
</P>
<P>
He added that the submarine had no heavy weapons but training
small arms.
</P>
<P>
"The South side must unconditionally return to the North the
submarine and its crew including the dead bodies at once," said
the spokesman.
</P>

A spokesman of South Korean Defense Ministry on Monday
described the incident as a "military provocation" and rejected
the DPRK's demand for the return of the submarine.

<P>
PARIS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A symposium on China's policy
on foreign investment, sponsored by the Chinese Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xinhua, deputy minister of the MFTEC, briefed French
participants on the economic situation and foreign investment in
China in his keynote speech at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign funded enterprises have actually invested a total of
155 billion U.S. dollars in China and the majority of joint
ventures and solely foreign funded enterprises are well managed,"
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
With the continuous growth of Sino-French economic and trade
relations in recent years, France had become the fourth largest
European investor in China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yves Galland, minister delegate to the French Ministry of
Economy and Finance in charge of finance and foreign trade, said
developing relations with China was a priority of the French
government.
</P>
<P>
France was determined to seize the "huge opportunity" of the
Chinese market, he said.
</P>
<P>
France encouraged its businessmen to invest in China, because
China had created sound conditions for foreign investment, he
said. He noted that China had brought inflation under control while
ensuring the continuous and fast expansion of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Galland said China's foreign currency reserves and the
purchasing power of its consumers were quickly increasing.
</P>

He hoped the Chinese side would do a better job in
helping foreign enterprises obtain more accurate market
information in China and learn more about the Chinese laws and
regulations.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Conventions Help Parties Raise Near Record Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Republican and
Democratic parties had one of the most lucrative fund-raising
periods in August partly because of their presidential nominating
conventions.
</P>
<P>
The Republican Party again topped the Democrats by taking in 23
million dollars in August. It spent almost 4.4 million dollars to
produce and air TV ads for Bob Dole, who was pressed against the
legal limit on a presidential primary spending.
</P>
<P>
The pre-convention aid chipped away at the 74 million dollars
that Dole is allowed to spend on his fall presidential campaign,
which officially began when he became presidential nominee on
August 14 in San Diego, California.
</P>
<P>
Dole and President Bill Clinton, who was renominated last month
in Chicago, each received 62 million dollars in taxpayer funding
for the fall campaigns. In addition, each is allowed 12 million
dollars in direct aid from his political party.
</P>
<P>
The Democrats, boosted by their convention and contributions
raised at cross-country birthday bashes for President Clinton,
took in about 15 million dollars, a party spokesman estimated
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Democrats' best fund-raising month to date was June, at 16
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
When the last quarter ended in June, the Republican committee
led the Democrats in fund-raising, 144 million dollars to 122
million dollars, for the election cycle that began January 1, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Republican National Committee reported details of its
fund-raising to the Federal Election Commission Monday. The
Democratic National Committee, which files quarterly reports, will
not file its financial information until October 15.
</P>
<P>
The Republican Party's take includes about 6.6 million dollars
in unrestricted "soft money" donations from corporations and
wealthy patrons.

<HEADLINE> World Bank's MIGA Posts Record Growth in Fiscal 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The outstanding portfolio
of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) has more
than doubled in the past two years, the agency announced here
today.
</P>
<P>
The MIGA, a member of the World Bank Group, said its investment
guarantee increased from 1 billion U.S. dollars at the end of the
1994 fiscal year to about 2.3 billion dollars in coverage in
fiscal 1996, which ended on June 30.
</P>
<P>
Fiscal 1996 marked a record growth in the MIGA's 7-year-old
investment guarantee business. The agency issued 68 investment
guarantee contracts for 862 million dollars in new coverage, as
compared with 54 contracts for 672 million dollars in fiscal 1995.
</P>
<P>
MIGA-insured projects also exceeded the fiscal 1995 total in
the amount of foreign investment facilitated, which is 6.6 billion
dollars as compared with 2.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In fiscal 1996, the MIGA assisted private firms from 17
different countries in making investments in 27 host developing

<HEADLINE> Rupee Expected to Fall Further Against US Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Indian currency rupee is
expected to depreciate by a further 3-5 percent over the next six
months to hit 37 rupees against one US dollar, bankers said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Going by economic fundamentals, the rupee has to depreciate to
keep pace with the level of inflation differential which is around
6 percent now. Allowing for this factor, the depreciation of the
rupee by 6-7 percent per annum is considered normal.
</P>
<P>
Over the last two-to-three months, there has been a
depreciation of 2-3 percent as compared to spot rates of the rupee
against the US dollar from June 1996. Over the next six months
there will be a further depreciation taking the annual figure to
6-7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will continue to buy US
dollars in the market to meet its debt servicing requirements.
Over the last four-to-five months, the RBI has bought a little
over half a billion US dollars in the domestic foreign exchange
stock market to service the debt and regulate the rates to ensure
only a gradual decline in the rupee value, bankers said.
</P>
<P>
Over the next six months, there will be an increase in imports
as industrial activity has once again begun to increase and the
rupee, therefore, may slide faster than it has over the last three
months, they added.

the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) stronger for mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
In a message of greetings Monday to NAM leaders marking the
movement's 35th anniversary, the Vietnamese leader expressed
confidence that the movement would strengthen and play a more
important role in the new era.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that NAM will continue its important role as an
organization in the post-Cold War, to rally and unite more than
100 independent states to struggle for a world of peace and
equality," he said.
</P>
<P>
All nations should respect others' national independence and
sovereignty, not intervene in their internal affairs, and should
work together for development, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the biggest challenge facing NAM member countries
today was the widening gap of socio-economic development between
developing and developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The NAM should continue efforts to enhance solidarity and
cooperation among its members, he said.
</P>
<P>
The organization should also boost cooperation and dialogue
with industrialized countries in tackling global issues and
working for the common goals of peace, national independence,
sustainable development and prosperity, he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Kesri Out to Strengthen India's Congress Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Newly appointed provisional
president of the Congress Party Sitaram Kesri told reporters last
night soon after his appointment, "I will try everything possible
to strengthen the party."
</P>
<P>
Senior Congress leader Sitaram Kesri was chosen by the Congress
Working Committee (CWC), the highest policy-making body of the
party, to be the provisional president of the Congress to succeed
P.V. Narasimha Rao.
</P>
<P>
Rao resigned soon after a Delhi court issued an order Saturday
summoning him as the co-accused in the 100,000 US dollar cheating
case to appear in person before it on September 30.
</P>
<P>
Never discarding the Gandhi cap ever since he joined the
Congress, Kesri belonged to a rare tribe of congressmen who never
left the party during its numerous splits since 1969.
</P>
<P>
Born in Dinapore in Bihar state in eastern India 80 years ago,
he plunged into the freedom movement when he was barely 13 years
old. He was imprisoned by the British first in 1930 and six times
more later in the struggle against the British rule over the
country.
</P>
<P>
Working tirelessly for the party, Kesri's first major break
came in 1973 when he became president of the Bihar parliamentary
Congress committee and remained at the post till 1977.
</P>
<P>
During the past two decades, he has been the treasurer of the
Congress since 1977.
</P>
<P>
His ministerial debut came in 1980 when the late Indira Gandhi
made him minister of parliamentary affairs. Two years later he was
made the minister of state for shipping and transport. He was
minister for welfare in the Rao's cabinet since 1991.

COLOMBO, September 24 (Xinhua)-- A massive iron railing is to
be constructed round the outer perimeter of Sri Lanka's ancient
Sri Maha Bodhi Temple in Anuradhapura town of North Central
province, according to police sources here today.
</P>
<P>
It is in this premises that the Bo tree grew from a sapling of

Regularly thousands of devotees worship here. The Bo tree is over
2,300 years old.
</P>
<P>
A sum of 1 million rupees (17,800 US dollars) has been
allocated for the construction of the railing which is considered
necessary as it is a prime target of the rebels of the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam who made a plan to attack this sacred place
recently, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The North Central Provincial Council will provide funds of up
to 89,000 US dollars to set a metal detector gate at the main

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Doctors from South Asian
countries gathered here to discuss the current situation of AIDS
and tuberculosis (TB) in the region and to work out a common plan
of action to fight TB associated AIDS co-epidemic.
</P>
<P>
A SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation)
consultative meeting on TB and AIDS opened here Monday to
formulate policies and strategies to control the deadly diseases
in a coordinated way.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC groups Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives,
Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
According to participants, the World Health Organization (WHO)
puts the number of HIV-positive cases in South Asia at 1.5 million
while in the meantime the region sees more than three million new
TB cases every year.
</P>
<P>
The situation is getting worse as more cases of TB associated
HIV infection are reported, they warned.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the co-epidemic of TB and AIDS will increase
sharply in TB cases, which claim about 1 million lives in the
South Asian region every year according to WHO estimates.
</P>
<P>
About 60 to 80 percent of AIDS patients suffer from TB too, and
the TB associated AIDS has become the cause of over half the
AIDS-related deaths, they told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
They argued that preventative steps are the best measure to
combat TB and AIDS in the poverty-stricken SAARC region, urging
member states to make common efforts to overcome the problem.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting, organized by the SAARC Tuberculosis
Center (STC) in Kathmandu, is attended by 15 TB and AIDS experts

<P>
JAKARTA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will build more
power plants with a capacity of 23,900 megawatts by the year
2003/2004 to meet the electricity demand in the country, a senior
official said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Mines and Energy L.B. Sudjana said at the opening
ceremony of an electronic symposium here Monday that total cost of
the planned power plants is about 62 billion US dollars.
</P>

"This amount of capital investment is very large for a
developing country like Indonesia," the newspaper Indonesia Times
today quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that besides 50.5 billion dollar investment from the
state electricity company, the projects also need 11.3 billion

Sudjana said that the Indonesian government is determined to
make electricity available to all regions, including the villages.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Expects U.S.-Russian Ties to Develop Smoothly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton said today that he is confident the U.S.-Russian relations
will develop smoothly, despite the health problem of Russian
President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the remarks at the white House when signing the
U.S. defense spending authorization bill for the 1997 fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government has "come a long way in developing
constitutional mechanisms of authority," and the United States has
maintained "regular contact" with other top Russian officials
including Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I feel comfortable right now that our relationship will
proceed on a normal course," the U.S. president told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has announced that he will have heart surgery at
the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
But Renat Akchrin, top heart surgeon and head of the operation
team, said last weekend that the surgery to improve the blood
supply to Yeltsin might be delayed for six to eight weeks and
there was a risk of the operation being cancelled altogether if
Yeltsin's health did not permit it.

<HEADLINE> China to Launch Petrochemical Project in Qaidam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- China is to build a 4.3
billion yuan petrochemical project in the Qaidam Basin, northwest
China's Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Zhou Yongkang, deputy general manager of
the China Oil and Gas Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Zhou explained that during the current Ninth Five-Year Plan
Period (1996-2000), the country will carry out large-scale
exploitation of the natural gas reserves in the Qaidam Basin. The
construction of the project is aimed at promoting the economic
development of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
</P>
<P>
He added that according to an initial plan, the project will
have a designed annual production capacity of 120,000 tons of
polyvinyl chloride, 100,000 tons of caustic soda, 200,000 tons of
synthetic ammonia and 350,000 tons of urea.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that the project had already passed assessment and
appraisal from China International Consultancy Company, and his
corporation has been negotiating over the investment possibility
with US company, Amoco Petroleum.
</P>
<P>
Qaidam Basin has an area of 240,000 square kilometers,
equivalent to the size of Great Britain, and it is also one of
China's four major basins.
</P>
<P>
China has discovered 22 oilfields in the Qaidam Basin after
more than four decades of prospecting. Of the 22 oilfields, six
fields, with combined natural gas reserves of 54.1 billion cubic
meters, boast sound conditions for full-scale development.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the installation of a 189 km pipeline
from Sebei Oilfield to Golmud City, also located in the basin,
which will form part of the new petrochemical project, has just
been finished. A 16,000-kilowattt power station using natural gas
as fuel has also been built.

<HEADLINE> Dazhai Becoming Popular Tourism Destination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Dazhai, a village in Xiyang
County in north China's Shanxi Province, became nationally known
in the 1960s as a "pace-setter" in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Now it has become a popular destination for domestic and
overseas tourists.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, during the first eight months
of this year, more than 60,000 Chinese and overseas tourists
visited the village. It is expected that the number of tourists to
Dazhai will reach 100,000 by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s Dazhai was mostly ignored by outsiders. Today
however, there has been a revival, and visitors can find pavilions
and a long corridor scattered amongst the greenery of nearby Hutou
Hill, with the yellow roof reflecting the bright sunlight.
</P>
<P>
The emergence of Dazhai Village Comprehensive Building of
Industry and Trade, the Sheep Wool Sweater Factory, a joint
venture between Dazhai Village and an overseas investor, a cement
plant and other agricultural and breeding facilities shows the
tremendous changes the country's reform and open-up drive has
brought to the mountainous village.
</P>
<P>
The officials attributed the boom in tourism to the opening in
June of the Taiyuan-Jiuguan Expressway, and is now also linked to
Beijing-Tianjin and Beijing-Shijiazhuang expressways.
</P>
<P>
Many people visit the village to receive education in
patriotism, said the officials.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Foreign Investment to Drop in 1996/97 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's foreign
investment inflow in 1996 and 1997 would slow down, growing by a
mere 15 percent a year compared with the 25 percent in 1995, while
the inflation rate would remain above eight percent in the same
period, the Bureau of Statistics warned.
</P>
<P>
In its report released here Monday, the bureau cited
inconsistent micro-economic policies as the main culprit of the
sluggish foreign investment in addition to high bank interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment approvals, according to the Investment
Coordinating Board, declined in value by 2.7 percent to 21 billion
US dollars between January and July 15 this year from 27.2 billion
in the same period of last year. Meanwhile, the value of domestic
investment approvals rose 127 percent to 70.6 trillion rupiah (one
dollar equals 2,320 rupiah) from 31 trillion rupiah.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, foreign investment approvals rose 68 percent to 39.9
billion US dollars from 23.7 billion in 1994, while domestic
investment approvals increased 30 percent to 69.9 trillion rupiah
from 53.3 trillion.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Statistics said that the slower foreign
investment growth would result in a decline in the aggregate
growth of gross domestic capital to 7.67 percent in 1996 and 7.91
percent in 1997, compared with the 8.4 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
It also expected the country's inflation rate to reach 8.5
percent this calendar year and 8.9 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
The bureau attributed the high estimates to continued increases
in demand for consumer products.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government had planned to keep the inflation
rate at 5 percent per annum in the current five year development
period ending in 1999. The target has yet to be achieved, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
According to the Bureau of Statistics, government policies to
fight inflation through fiscal and monetary measures have not been
effective due to growth in short-term foreign funds through
domestic equity and money markets.

<HEADLINE> Thai Parliament Might Be Dissolved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 24 (Xinhua) -- A dissolution of the Thai
parliament may be inevitable if coalition parties cannot agree on
a new prime minister to succeed Banharn Silpa-archa, a coalition
party Prachakorn Thai (Thai Citizen) leader Samak Sundaravej said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Banharn announced last Saturday he will resign within seven
days and choose a successor from his coalition.
</P>
<P>
If the six coalition parties cannot reach agreement before
today's cabinet meeting, they will have to try again afterwards,
Samak was quoted today by local daily the Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Once Banharn Silpa-archa announced his successor, a government
should take shape without problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
The prospect of a dissolution, he said, depended on how
Banharn's Chart Thai (Thai Nation) assessed political conditions.
Anyone wanting a dissolution must make Chart Thai angry.
</P>
<P>
According to another report today, Banharn has proposed Pongpol
Adireksarn, minister of the prime minister's office, as Chart
Thai's choice to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
Sources said Banharn made it clear that he would propose to a
Chart Thai meeting this afternoon that it back Pongpol Adireksarn.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Overseas Income to Hit 7 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The central bank of the
Philippines projected that the country's overseas remittances
would hit a record-high 7 billion US dollars this year, an
increase of 42 percent from last year's 4.9 billion, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Babriel Singson, governor of the central bank, told a press
conference Monday that this healthy influx of foreign exchange
from the export of services will help bring down the country's
ballooning trade deficit which reached 7.1 billion dollars in the
first seven months of the year.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, this is seen to lead to an even healthier buildup
of the country's foreign exchange reserves. By the end of August,
the central bank's gross international reserves had reached 11.43
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Singson said the prediction was based on the growth of overseas
income in the first six months this year. He added that
remittances during this period had already amounted to 3.48
billion dollars, or a hefty 57-percent increase from the year-ago
level of 2.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
"The uptick is expected to continue in the second half of the
year, particularly during the fourth quarter, when remittances
traditionally shoot up as the Christmas season nears," Singson
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the overseas income will continue to play an important
role in the development of the national economy because it will
take some time for merchandise exports to outpace imports.
</P>
<P>
However, economists reiterated that the sustainable development
of the country's economy should not be hinged on the "volatile"
income from overseas workers. They asked the government to
concentrate on promoting merchandise exports and foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
According to the local press, there are now 4 million Filipinos
working in more than 120 countries or regions. About 60 percent of
the overseas workers are female and most of them are housemaids or
entertainers.

<HEADLINE> HIV Positives Up Among Colombian Heterosexuals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The number of people in
Colombia infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV),
which causes AIDS, reached 16,331 in August, says a report by
Colombia's Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
Of these, 9,331 were people with no symptoms, which meant that
they had not so far developed AIDS, while 6,981 had.
</P>
<P>
HIV cases among heterosexuals had increased, while those among
homosexuals and bisexuals had decreased.
</P>
<P>
Until August of this year, 1,518 became infected from
heterosexual contacts. The number of homosexual transmissions was
1,087, while the bisexual cases numbered 550.
</P>
<P>
This demonstrated that homosexuals were changing their sexual
behavior, while heterosexuals were not yet aware of the danger of
the disease, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Bogota, the nation's capital, recorded the largest number of
new HIV positives with 716, followed by Antioquia with 330, Valle
del Cauca 323, Atlantico 175, Santander 166, Choco 40 and Huila 39.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health established a phone line on August 20
to offer free information on sexually transmitted diseases and
AIDS. People in Colombia living outside Bogota can make a
toll-free call to the city.
</P>
<P>
A total of 3,044 Colombians have died of AIDS, since the
disease was first recorded in 1983 in the city of Cartagena de
Indias.

<HEADLINE> Guatemala's Peace Process to Enter Final Stage in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The coordinator of
Guatemala's Peace Commission, Gustavo Porras, announced today that
the government and the guerrillas will enter the final stage of
the peace process in October.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Guatemala City said the delegations from the
government and the Revolutionary National Unity of Guatemala will
debate on the "operative" topics on October 3-5 in Mexico City,
which comprise the final part of the negotiations agenda.
</P>
<P>
The operative topics include the reentry of combatants into
civil life, amnesty, cease-fire and demobilization.
</P>
<P>
On September 19, the Guatemalan government and the guerrillas
signed an agreement that paved the way to a final accord to end
the 36-year civil war in this Central American country.
</P>
<P>
It was the last of the six agreements on social, economic and
political issues between the civilian government and the
guerrillas since the peace process began in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, aiming to strengthen the civil power and the
role of the army in a democratic society, calls for a 33-percent
reduction of the armed forces and allows the defense minister to
be a civilian.
</P>
<P>
Other agreements include human rights, the relocation of
displaced people, the identity and rights of the indigenous
peoples, socioeconomic issues and agricultural reforms.
</P>
<P>
A final accord is expected to be signed later this year to end
the civil war which has left 175,000 people dead, 45,000 missing
and 1 million displaced.

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, September 24 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hubei
Province is flying high after seeing a take-off in its air
transport system.
</P>
<P>
Until recently the province saw a slow development in aviation
transport, only starting its first civilian flight in 1984.
</P>
<P>
But since last year the province has stepped up development of
air travel with the opening of Shijiazhuang Airport. The airport
is listed as one of the alternative airports for Beijing Capital
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
According to provincial aviation officials, Hebei has opened 17
domestic air routes linking the province with 19 major Chinese
cities, and also an air route to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
By the end of October, Shijiazhuang Airport will open four more
domestic air routes to Kunming, Nanjing, Xiamen and Qingdao, and
chartered flights to Russia are expected to begin later this year.
</P>
<P>
Not far from Beijing and Tianjin, two largest cities in the
country, Hebei is one of the major agriculture production bases
and rich in mineral and tourism resources.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this century, Hubei will transform Shijiazhuang
Airport into an international airport and build or expand four
other major airports in the province.

<HEADLINE> Great Achievement of Township-run Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The turnover of township-run
enterprises in northwest China's Shaanxi Province is expected to
reach 100 billion yuan by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
It had already exceeded 68 billion yuan by the end of August,
said local officials.
</P>
<P>
Sales volumes of the enterprises make up 76 percent of the
rural economy and their industrial output value accounts for 46
percent of the province's total.
</P>
<P>
According to Quan Zhichang, director of a provincial bureau in
charge of township-run enterprises, nine counties have each
generated turnovers of over two billion yuan, 20 counties' have
reached over one billion yuan each, even 26 villages have
generated more than 100 million yuan each.
</P>
<P>
The success has been due to the popularization of new
technology. The township-run enterprises often make use of the
latest technology offered by universities and scientific research
institutions. Now some of the enterprises' products are exported
to the Unites States, Japan and Germany.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises made great efforts to carry out enterprise
system reforms, and over 8,400 of them have established a
share-holding system.

<HEADLINE> Mexico's Foreign Debt Up 64 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's foreign debt has
increased by 64 percent over the past 10 years, said financial
sources here today.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Ministry of Treasury and Public Credit said
that, by June this year, the country's total foreign debt had
reached 165.5 billion U.S. dollars, equivalent to 56.3 percent of
the gross domestic product (GDP) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The refinancing process, which the government implemented last
year, had helped curb foreign indebtedness and achieved a 4.6
billion dollar decrease from 1995 when it reached its highest
level.
</P>
<P>
Mexico currently pays an annual interest rate of 8.25 percent,
similar to what it paid in 1991.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Mexico entered a phase of excessive debt as foreign
debt increased for the federal government, the development bank,
the Banco de Mexico and the private sector.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, international liabilities went up from 142.2 billion
dollars to 170.2 billion dollars, because of new loans from the
U.S. Treasury Department and the International Monetary Fund for
helping curb the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, tax authorities made prepayments on the
government debt, which only decreased from 100.9 billion dollars
to 98.5 billion dollars in June.

<HEADLINE> Shanxi Sets High Goals for Harnessing Loess Plateau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, September 23 (Xinhua) -- North China's Shanxi Province
plans to harness 50 percent of its soil erosion area by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to years of efforts to harness the Loess Plateau, Shanxi
has so far contained 51 million mu (3.06 million hectares), or 32
percent of its total eroded area.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi, located near the middle reaches of the Yellow River,
occupies a large part of the Loess Plateau. Soil erosion area
accounts for 70 percent of its total 156,000 square kilometer of
ground.
</P>
<P>
In the late 1970s, the annual amount of sand washed into the
Yellow River stood at 366 million tons -- one-fourth of the
river's total.
</P>
<P>
A large-scale campaign to harness the Loess Plateau first began
in the 1980s. Over the following several years, 350,000 local
rural households participated in the drive.
</P>
<P>
By planting grass, trees and crops, and building dams and
terraced farmland, the residents revived hundreds of thousands of
barren gullies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the central government and the Shanxi provincial
government also worked to prevent the spread of erosion in the
Loess Plateau.
</P>
<P>
The central government has invested 75 million yuan to tackle
erosion of the banks of the Sanchuan River and Yongding River, two
large rivers on the plateau. Eroded areas which have been
controlled there account for 40 percent of the total drainage area
of the two rivers.
</P>
<P>
A total of 150 million yuan has been used in harnessing the
upper reaches of the Fenhe River, the second largest tributary of
the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
Erosion-harnessing projects were carried out on an area of 1.95
million mu (117,000 hectares) there. In the region, grain output
increased by 50 percent, farmers' income rose two-fold, and the
volume of sand which washed into reservoirs was reduced by 49
percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- China appreciates
Yugoslavia's policy of peace and wishes to see peaceful
coexistence between the countries in the regions of former
Yugoslavia, said Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen here today.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Milan
Milutinovic here this morning, Qian, who is also foreign minister,

in its related regions.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who is here attending the 51st Session of the General
Assembly of the United Nations, said that there has been some
improvement in the environment.
</P>
<P>
"Yugoslavia plays an important role in maintaining peace and
stability in the former Yugoslav regions," Qian said, adding that
China appreciates the peace policy of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic, who met Qian for the first time since he became
foreign minister, briefed his Chinese counterpart on the latest
peace process. With the ending of Bosnia's post-war elections, the
international community should lift sanctions against Yugoslavia
in all sectors, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister said that China is against the
practice of applying sanctions against a country lightly.
</P>
<P>
"Now that Bosnia's election is being held according to
schedule, we hope the international community will keep its
promise and lift sanctions against Yugoslavia," Qian said, adding
that China also hopes that countries in the region will be
friendly to each other and establish normal relations among them.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers expressed their satisfaction for the
development of bilateral relations between the two countries.

<P>
BONN, September 23 (Xinhua) -- German Defense Minister Volker
Ruehe confirmed here today that NATO will send follow-up
peace-keeping forces to Bosnia-Herzegovina after the present
Implementation Force (IFOR) finishes its mission on December 20.
</P>
<P>
Ruehe said for this purpose defense ministers of 16 NATO
members will meet in Bergen, Norway, on September 25 and 26, to
discuss tasks of the follow-up forces, and entrust military
personnels to draw up operation plans for them.
</P>
<P>
The follow-up forces of 20,000 to 25,000 will mainly work to
maintain stability among Bosnia political forces, prevent new
fightings, and explain, supervise and implement the Dayton peace
agreement singed last year.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, however, that the forces' new tasks will wait to
be finally approved by the United Nations and NATO in November.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Heavy Fightings Reported on Zairean-Rwandan Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Heavy exchanges of artillery,
rocket and machine-gun fires were reported from Sunday night to
Monday morning on the Zairean-Rwandan border between Bukavu,
eastern Zaire, and Cyangugu, southwest Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Bukavu has been shelled by bombs "from the Rwandan territory
and the Zairean army has counterattacked," according to National
Radio of Zaire monitored here.
</P>
<P>
"The information has been confirmed by the Ministry of
Interior," said the radio.
</P>
<P>
Fighting was first reported by Radio Agatashya, a Swiss-funded
independent radio in the Great Lake region of central Africa.
</P>
<P>
The International Red Cross in Kinshasa, capital of Zaire, also
confirmed that intensified fightings took place Sunday night, but
was unable to say which side opened fire first.
</P>
<P>
It said that the situation was "totally normal" in Bukavu this
morning, with all the markets open and children going to school.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Zaire accused Rwanda and Burundi of
"fomenting troubles" in the region of Uvira south to Bukavu, but
met rejection from both of them.
</P>
<P>
Zairean troops launched at the beginning of the month a
large-scale hunting of Rwandan and Burundian Tutsi armed elements
in the hills of Uvira near the Burundian border.
</P>
<P>
About one million Rwandan Hutu refugees have been living in
refugee camps in eastern Zaire, after they fled Rwanda following a
genocide committed by Hutu army and militias against Tutsis and
Hutu moderates in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Hopes UN to Play Greater Role in Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Through peace,
cooperation, respect for human rights and development, the U.N.
has a major role to play in preventing the division of the Cold
War from finding new expression in a widening gap in well-being,
said Brazilian Foreign Minister Luiz Felipe Lampreia today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the General Debate of the 51st
Session of the U.N. General Assembly this morning, Lampreia said
that with the political and ideological constraints of the Cold
War behind, the world is now organized around much more concrete
and pragmatic variables, such as international trade, investment
flows and the transfer of technology.
</P>
<P>
"The emphasis on political and ideological coalitions has given
way to an emphasis on economic coalitions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pressured by public opinion, he said, governments today are
concerned with social well-being, the quality of life, economic
and social indicators, unemployment. The focal point of the
political debate is shifting irrevocably from strategy and
ideology to economics and integration, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that contradictory trends have developed in the world
today: a world which generates prosperity and a healthy
competition among countries and regions; but a world which swells
the ranks of the destitute and the outcasts among and within
countries; a world which breeds conflict and increases inequality;
a world which demands reason, reflection and construction action.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations must evolve in order to successfully play
that role as it has so often done in the past. It must adapt its
structure and methods of work in order to optimize its human,
material and financial resources. It must make use of the great
political, strategic and moral power it is able to muster, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the U.N. must implement and follow up on its
decisions, on the rule with which it updates and consolidates
international law and on the commitments it has won from the
international community.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. must ensure that its agenda becomes more appealing and
result-oriented, in order to earn the esteem of the public and to
retain its priority in international relations, he said.

PARIS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A French military delegation
arrived in Bosnia today to help the Serbs and the Muslim-Croat
Federation to destroy their excessive heavy weapons in accordance
with an agreement signed in Vienna in June by Bosnia, Croatia and
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"The Republika Srspka" has agreed to let France help it destroy
the excessive part of its heavy armaments, which will be carried
out under the supervision of the Organization of Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), said French Foreign Ministry
vice-spokesman Yves Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serbs, Muslims and Croats are given 16 months to
destroy their excessive heavy weapons, according to the agreement
which was formalized by the United Nations at a conference of
examination of peace accords fulfillment in Bosnia held in Rome on
June 14.
</P>
<P>
"Paris has offered a help in the matter of destruction of the
armaments through the way of OSCE, which has transmitted the offer
to all parties (of Bosnia)," said Doutriaux, who did not say if
the Muslims and Croats have accepted the offer.
</P>
<P>
"We are aware of the difficulties which the obligations of
destruction of the materials pose on some parties... Assistance by
France conforms with our conception of military stability in the
region which goes with a balance of forces at the lowest possible
level," he said.

<HEADLINE> Low GDP Growth Registered in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's annual Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) growth averaged less than one percent
during the first five years of market reforms ended last year,
while total debt soared to over 4.3 billion U.S. Dollars, the
United Nations said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an analysis of African countries economic situation,
U.N.Secretary-General Boutros Boutros Ghali said economic
performance in Zimbabwe was lower than that recorded in
Mozambique, whose GDP growth averaged 3.08 percent, Swaziland
(2.51 percent), Tanzania (1.24 percent) and Botswana (3.45
percent).
</P>
<P>
The highest growth, of 4.33 percent was registered by Uganda,
which the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund last
year praised for its commitment to harsh market reforms to
reverse years of stagnation.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth in Zimbabwe between 1991 and 1995 was mainly
affected by two droughts in 1991/92 and 1994/95, which reversed
the marginal gains made when the southern African country
embarked on western-backed market reforms at the beginning of
1991.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics, Zimbabwe's population growth
between 1991 and 1995 averaged 2.36 percent, while the total debt
rose from 3.43 billion U.S.Dollars in 1991 to 4.4 billion
U.S.Dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Life expectancy, probably reflecting the magnitude of the AIDS
pandemic, declined from 60 years in 1991 to 54 years in 1994, so
did the infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births, which fell
from 61 in 1991 to 57 in 1994.

<HEADLINE> China's CPPCC Chairman Meets Russian Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) Li Ruihuan said here today that there are many
reasons for furthering the sound Sino-Russian relations but there
is no excuse to make them retrogress or stagnate.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Stepanovich
Chernomyrdin here this afternoon, Li said that the Chinese leaders
have always viewed Sino-Russian ties as a pillar of China's
foreign affairs and extremely treasured the friendship and
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is willing to try all its best to push
forward the growth of its ties with Russia.
</P>
<P>
China is a country with the world's largest population, while
Russia with the biggest area, Li said, and the two countries share
a boundary line of more than 4,300 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, a long-term and stable good-neighborliness
and mutually beneficial cooperation between them are not only
helpful to their economic development and the improvement of their
people's life, but also serving their interests of maintaining
their own state sovereignty, opposing foreign interference and
maintaining peace and stability in Northeast Asia and even the
world.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China has made great achievements since it started
to implement the policy of reform and opening to the outside
world, but such achievements should by no means be overestimated.
</P>
<P>
China, with a backward basis, a large population and unbalanced
development, has a long way to go in its modernization drive, Li
said, and China is willing to learn from Russia in many regards
especially in science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Over recent years, he said, exchange of visits at high levels
has become more frequent, and bilateral trade and economic
cooperation expanded. The two countries have supported each other
and maintained cooperation on many major domestic or international
issues, he added.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, great potential is yet to be tapped in
furthering bilateral cooperation in various fields, and China
hopes the two countries will further their relations of mutual
trust, mutual understanding and supporting each other so as to
seek benefits as much as possible for their peoples.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said that it is an unchangeable choice of Russia
to develop its friendship, cooperation and good-neighborliness
with China, and Russia is willing to make its greatest effort to
make the two countries good neighbors and partners.
</P>
<P>
Not everybody is happy with the sound relations between Russia
and China, the prime minister said, and therefore such relations
should be treasured and promoted in a positive way.
</P>
<P>
He said that Russia and China should make joint efforts to
further develop their trade and economic cooperation, especially
in the space industry, energy and infrastructure in a bid to speed
their pace of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, Li gave an interview to local pressmen
and answered their questions.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Defence Minister Arrives in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan Defence Minister Paul
Kagame arrived here today to find out how Zimbabwe can assist in
bolstering the country's return to peace in the aftermath of the
1994 civil war and genocide.
</P>
<P>
Kagame, who is also Rwandan Vice-President, said the genocide
had seen the destruction of human life and infrastructure and
Rwanda could draw lessons from Zimbabwe on how to cement
reconciliation among its different sections of the population and
achieve economic development.
</P>
<P>
''We are trying to create sufficient stability and carry on
those processes (reconciliation and economic development) and
Zimbabwe can be very helpful in terms of enabliing us to bring
about that stability,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Kagame's visit comes after the
United Nations lifted restrictions on the sale or supply of arms
or related material to the Rwandan government with effect from
September 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
The restrictions were put in 1994 when the government then in
power engahged in genocide and massacres which left up to a
million Tutsis and moderate Hutus dead.

<HEADLINE> Cease-Fire Monitors to Resume Meeting in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A five-nation committee
monitoring a cease-fire between Lebanon and Israel is to resume
its meeting in a south Lebanese border town Tuesday to discuss
complaints lodged by Lebanon and the Jewish state against each
other.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was called by Lebanon to consider two complaints
it filed to the committee accusing Israel of violating the
cease-fire by shelling southern Lebanon's villages last Thursday
and deporting two Lebanese families from a border strip occupied
by the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Israel also complained to the committee that guerrillas of
Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, fired on its
forces from three civilian-inhabited villages in the area that
day.
</P>
<P>
After a four-hour session at Naqura Sunday, the cease-fire
monitoring committee, which groups the United States, France,
Israel, Lebanon and Syria, adjourned the meeting until Tuesday
because of the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur.
</P>
<P>
It was the forth meeting of the cease-fire monitoring
committee, but the first at Lebanon's request. The previous
three meetings were called by Israel.
</P>
<P>
The committee was set up under a cease-fire understanding
brokered by the U.S. between Lebanon and Israel, which put an
end to a 17-day Israeli blitz in April against Hezbollah, and
which is aimed at protecting civilians on both sides from any
military activities.
</P>
<P>
Reliable official sources close to the Lebanese delegates in
the committee said that the Sunday meeting was limited to
handling the first Lebanese complaint pertaining to the Israeli
bombardment at southern Lebanese villages and wounding civilians
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli delegates admitted the truth in the Lebanese
accusation, but claimed that the shelling took place because
Lebanese guerrillas opened fire from houses in the villages
during a fighting with the Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
Tensions escalated in south Lebanon since the Thursday clash
in which two Israeli soldiers were killed and at least eight
others wounded.
</P>
<P>
The casualties brought to 20 the number of Israeli soldiers
killed by Hezbollah guerrillas in south Lebanon this year.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation for the guerrilla attack, Israeli jets and
artillery blasted southern Lebanese villages, wounding a woman
and a child.

<P>
The dispatch of the team was suggested by UN Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali. Reports say the team will return to Cameroun
for further consultation upon ending its Nigerian tour, but Nigerian
sources are not available for confirmation at the moment.

Nigeria and Cameroun have been clashing over the oil-rich
Bakassi Peninsula since 1994, with the latest conflicts
occurring last April. enditem

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Down Sharply on Wall Street's Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Europe's leading stock markets
all ended down sharply today, undermined by worries about monetary
policy on both sides of the Atlantic and by an early 50-point fall
on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
Losses on Wall Street weighed on an already volatile London
market ahead of the outcome of monetary policy meetings both in
the U.S. and in Britain, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
Markets were poised for a quarter point base rate rise in the
U.S., but few economists expected any changes at the latest
meeting between Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor, and the governor
of the Bank of England.
</P>
<P>
British shares closed 44.4 points down, or 1.12 percent lower
today after hitting an intraday peak of 3,994.1 last Friday.
</P>
<P>
German shares in Frankfurt also finished lower, 19.06 points
down on the DAX-30 share index, in cautious trading ahead of
Tuesday's U.S. Federal Open Markets Committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
Dealers also cited profit-taking after record gains Friday as
another driving force for the market's losses.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, French stocks ended down 12.37 points on the CAC-40
share index along with London and Frankfurt. Bearish world markets
and fears of more French public sector strikes weighed on shares
prices there, traders said.
</P>
<P>
London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading
British shares closed 44.4 points lower at 3,919.7. The Frankfurt
DAX-30 index ended 19.06 down at 2,627.04. The Paris CAC-30 share
index finished down 12.37 at 2,067.09.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The southern African
countries have been called upon to develop agriculture to meet
food requirements of the people.
</P>
<P>
The minister for Agriculture and Cooperatives of Tanzania, Paul
Kimiti, made the call today when he opened the 5th southern African
countries meeting on farming systems research and extension in Arusha,
northern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Kimiti said that further agricultural development would be attained
when food production exceed population growth, currently standing at
about three percnt in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said more agricultural production could be the answer for
the population pressure, which had negative effects to the
environment as it could cause soil erosion, loss of biodiversity and
groundwater pollution becasue of the excessive use of agro-chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Kimiti told participants from nine southern African
countries that commodity research in the region was appreciable, but
the rate of adoption of innovations had not reached the expected
level.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from Arusha, the three-day conference draws
researchers and agricultural extension officers from Botswana, Kenya,
Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe
and Brazil. enditem

<HEADLINE> Georgia Condemns Aggressive Separatism at UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Irakli Menagarishvili,
foreign minister of Georgia, today strongly condemned "aggressive
separatism," which has become the main cause threatening
international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the general debate of the 51st session of the U.N.
General Assembly, Menagarishvili said that aggressive separatism,
though not a new phenomenon, has only comparatively recently come
into the focus of the world community, due to its global nature
and its destructive impact on international security.
</P>
<P>
"No matter what the fundamental underlying reasons for the
emergency of separatist movements, their nature, scale and
location, they have one thing in common: under the banner of
`self-determination of suppressed people,' regimes are created on
the ideological basis of terrorism," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the U.N. Charter and international law have
clearly determined that the right of self-determination, going as
far as the creation of independent states, is provided to peoples
under colonial suppression.
</P>
<P>
"But it is unacceptable when this principle is misused by
national minorities, or nations small in number, who have
historically constituted a single society with other nations,
within the framework of sovereign states, which today are members
of the United Nations," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
International law does not allow the encroachment of such
peoples and ethnic minorities onto the territorial integrity and
political unity of democratic states, respecting human rights and
giving these groups of people the possibility to preserve their
national character, cultural development, up to and including the
creation of political institutions, he said.
</P>
<P>
"That's why, when we speak of the necessity of struggling
against aggressive separatism, we have in mind a national minority,
or small nation, using weapons or foreign military support, to
break away a part of historic territory of a state within which it
exists," he said.
</P>
<P>
Aggressive separatism uses ethnic cleansing as the main tool of
vengeance against other nations and ethnic groups, which have
resulted in millions of refugees and displaced persons, he said.
For example, 300,000 Georgian citizens were expelled from the
territory of Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
On preventing and overcoming separatist tendencies, he put
forward the following measures:
</P>
<P>
-- to define separatism in terms of international law as a
phenomenon so as to identify and categorize aggressive separatism
in international legal documents;
</P>
<P>
-- to introduce and enforce economic measures, including
economic sanctions, against aggressive separatism;
</P>
<P>
-- to take measures of military-political character such as
imposing an embargo on supplies of arms to the regions where
separatism takes aggressive forms; and
</P>
<P>
-- to punish those who have committed crimes against humanity
through international tribunal.

<P>
On the first day attending the General Assembly's sessions

fine cooperation between China and Malaysia. China supports
Razali's work, he said.

<HEADLINE> UK PM Delighted by Anti-Terror Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major said today he was "absolutely delighted" by the success of
the raids in London earlier this morning which foiled the bombing
plans of the Irish Republican Army (IRA).
</P>
<P>
It "put in their proper context professions of peaceful
intentions by Sinn Fein's leaders and speculation about a renewed
IRA cease-fire," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
A very large quantity of explosives was recovered, as well as
firearms and bomb-making equipment, Scotland Yard said.
</P>
<P>
"The operation has undoubtedly frustrated a serious imminent
IRA terrorist attack on the British mainland involving the
deployment of a large vehicle bomb likely to have caused grave
loss of life and massive disruption," it added.
</P>
<P>
During the raids, an Irish guerilla suspect was killed. The
dead man was wounded in a shoot-out as police officers arrested
him and five other suspects. Police said he died in hospital
shortly afterwards.
</P>
<P>
The IRA has planted a number of bombs in Britain since calling
off a 17-month-long cease-fire in February, citing British
intransigence over the progress of peace efforts in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein expressed regrets that somebody was killed in the
series of dawn anti-terrorist raids. Its leader Gerry Adams said
he presumed the IRA had been the focus of the operation.
</P>
<P>
He warned a vacancy in the peace process and said there was an
"absolute lack of confidence" in Britain's commitment to peace.
</P>
<P>
However, John Major reaffirmed in his statement, "The British
government remains fully committed to the Belfast negotiations
aimed at a comprehensive political settlement in Northern
Ireland."
</P>
<P>
"Northern Ireland's future will be settled by democratic,
peaceful discussion, not by violence or threats of violence. It is
time Sinn Fein and the IRA learned that lesson once and for all,"
he added.

MAPUTO, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States is likely
to resume its commercial food aid to Mozambique in 1997,
said representaive of the U.S.Internatioanl Aid Agency (USAID) in
Maputo, George Wachtenheim.
</P>

</P>
<P>
The US decision to resume its food assistance came after the
Mozambican police detained nine suspects involving in the theft
and the Mozambican government paid an indemnity of 247,000
U.S.Dollars to the U.S. this month.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> 4th Pan African Conference of Red Cross Opens in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has commended the International Committee of the Red
Cross for working in difficult political and physical conditions.
</P>
<P>
The president made the commendation in a speech read for him
by Prime Minister Kintu Musoke while opening the five-day 4th Pan
African Confernce of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies here
today.
</P>
<P>
Museveni observed that the Red Cross has in recent years given
assistance to a million refugees from Rwanda and Burundi. The
association also gave assistance to another million Mozambican
refugees in Malawi.
</P>
<P>
The president said the catalog of man-made disasters started
with massive and devastating extraction of human resources
through slavery to the west and east of the continent.
</P>
<P>
Museveni therefore expressed gratitude to the humanitarian
assistance given by the international community, and particularly
the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent
Societies.
</P>
<P>
Talking about Uganda, the president said that the Uganda Red
Cross has benefited through the recently completed Arua branch
modern office and residential block complex at Koboko in northern
Uganda, where hundreds of refugees from Sudan have been
accommodated for the last four years.
</P>
<P>
The president said the agenda from now on into the 21st
century should be to promote viable and relevant linkages, adding
the 21st century must be one of total development.
</P>
<P>
Mmuseveni observed that today millions of people in Africa
lack the bare necessities for survival, adding that the
inequalities between the rich and the poor are constantly
increasing.
</P>
<P>
He said thousands of persons are victims of discrimination,
like Africans who exist at the periphery of the developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that Africa's vulnerability has mainly been a
result of man-made disasters due to lack of viable mechanism of
conflict prevention and resolution.
</P>
<P>
He called for the strengthening of regional, continental and
international organisations to address conflict prevention and
resolution more effectively.
</P>
<P>
He called for a study of the root causes of the problems to
find durable solutions to them.
</P>
<P>
The opening ceremony was also addressed by President of Uganda
Red Cross Society Bishop Baharagate, President of the
International Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies Mario
Villarroel Lander and Vice President of the International
Committee of the Red Cross Eric Roethlisberger. enditem

<HEADLINE> US Set to Allow Ukraine to Join MTCR: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
is set to allow Ukraine to join an international missile control
accord while building missiles banned by the pact, The Washington
Times said today.
</P>
<P>
The new U.S. policy is being drawn up in preparation for a
plenary session of the 28-nation Missile Technology Control Regime
(MTCR) member nations in Edinburgh, Scotland, in early October,
the paper quoted Clinton administration officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that if
the new U.S. policy was approved at the meeting, Ukraine would
have the right under the MTCR to obtain advanced missile
technology and assistance from the United States and other
members.
</P>
<P>
The MTCR restricts exports of missiles with ranges greater than
186 miles and warheads heavier than 1,100 pounds.
</P>
<P>
But it also contains provisions that facilitate the sharing of
missile technology among members of the pact.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian officials have reportedly indicated that Kiev wants
to joint the MTCR but still be allowed to acquire several types of
missiles currently barred under the treaty, including
ground-launched ballistic missiles with ranges up to 310 miles
and air-launched cruise missiles with ranges up to 372 miles.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and foreign critics say that the new U.S. policy on
admitting new members to the MTCR would severely undermine efforts
to halt the spread of missiles around the world by promoting other
nations to join the pact as a way to acquire long-range missiles.

<HEADLINE> Africa Loses One Billion US Dollars Annually due </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Tsetse flies infest over 10
million square kilometers in Africa, an area which if cleared of
the menence could support an additional 120 million cattle,
generating one billion U.S. dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed today by Kenyan Permanent Secretary in the
Ministry of Technical Training and Applied Technology Wamatu
Njoroge.
</P>
<P>
In his speech read during the official opening of agriculture
research co-ordination meeting here, the permanent
secretary said 60 percent of Kenya's rangelands, about 25 percent
of the total landmass, cannot support livestock because of tsetse
infestation.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Wamatu Njoroge said about 50 million
people in Africa are at risk of acquiring sleeping disease adding
that surveillance in many known endemic areas is difficult.
</P>
<P>
He said the impact of both human and livestock sleeping
disease on the African continent has led to the under-exploitation of
resources in rangelands, and that the disease forces the
concentration of livestock in limited grazing areas, resulting in
overgrazing and land degradation.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Minister on Price Hike of Petroleum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Minister of
Trade and Industry Kassahun Ayela said today the increase in the
price of petroleum products will not have significant
repercussion on the economic status of the consumer since the
resulting effect will be cushioned by the better performance of
the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The remark was made by the minister after the Ethiopian
government announced an increase of prices of petroleum products
effecting from last Sunday. For example, one liter of petrol
sells at 2.33 Birr (0.36 U.S.Dollar) from September 21, 1996, as
against 2 Birr before.
</P>
<P>
Kassahun was quoted by the Ethiopian News Agency as saying
that several economic indicators were considered and much caution
has been taken before the issuance of the price regulation to
make the effect minimal.
</P>
<P>
He said the regulation was necessitated by the increase in the
price of crude oil, from 17 Dollars per barrel two and half years
ago to the current level of 21 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
The measure taken by the government is part of the move toward
the ending of the subsidization system which is contrary to the
principles of the free market economy, the Ethiopian minister
added.

<HEADLINE> Perot Files Suit Over Presidential Debates Exclusion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Reform Party candidate
Ross Perot filed a suit today seeking a court order to bar
presidential debates from going forward without him.
</P>
<P>
"We're charging that the whole Commission on Presidential
Debates constitutes an illegal contribution to the (Republican and
Democratic) parties," said law professor Jamin Raskin, one of
Perot's lawyers, outside the federal courthouse.
</P>
<P>
Rankin is associate dean of the American University Law School
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The two 90-minute presidential debates are for October 6 and
16.
</P>
<P>
Today's filing is scheduled to go to U.S. District Judge Thomas
Hogan, and asks for a temporary restraining order and eventual
permanent injunction to include Perot in the debates.
</P>
<P>
Outside the U.S. courthouse today, Perot's national coordinator
Russell Verney told reporters and a group of Reform Party
supporters that Democrat Clinton and Republican Dole both bear
responsibility for Perot's exclusion -- Clinton for allowing his
negotiators to agree on debates without the third-party candidate,
and Dole for actively opposing Perot's inclusion.
</P>
<P>
"There is no more fundamental exercise of free speech in this
country than the right to vote for the candidate of your choice,"
Verney said. According to polls, at least 73 percent of the U.S.
public wants Perot included in the debates, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Democratic and Republican parties should not be permitted
to consolidate their monopoly on the political process by closing
off the presidential debates" to Perot and Choate, said the
26-page lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
"Declaring the election essentially over for all candidates but
two before a single debate takes place will only deepen the
nation's cynicism about government," it added.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit asked the federal court to direct the debate
commission or the Federal Election Commission "to either extend an
invitation to Perot and his running mate to participate in the
debates, or to cancel any debates staged and sponsored by the
CPD."
</P>
<P>
In today's filing against the Federal Election Commission and
the debate commission, Perot's lawyers argued that the commission
did not follow FEC rules when selecting debate participants.
</P>
<P>
"The FEC has unlawfully delegated control over debate selection
criteria to the five Democratic and five Republican members of the
(commission), who, in turn, have forsworn their obligation to
apply only objective candidate selection criteria," the filing
said.
</P>
<P>
Perot captured 19 percent of the votes in the 1992 presidential
election, but is registering only in single digits in current
political polling.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Describes Israel's Statements on Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Egypt said today that Israel's
rhetoric on the Middle East peace process is "dinosaurian" because
it completely contradicts with the logic of present realities.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the recent statements made by Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the German magazine Der Spiegel,
Assistant Foreign Minister Fathi el-Shazli said that the Israeli
rhetoric also contradicts with the fact that Israel is a party to
the peace process and is "disgusting."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told the magazine that there will not be a
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
In reference to Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai's
remarks in which he warned Syria against the redeployment of its
forces in Lebanon, Shazli said that Israel's threatening to resort
to military options can never help create the favorable atmosphere
for the success of any peaceful effort and will only have tragic
reactions.
</P>
<P>
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad have said that the Syrian
forces' moves in Lebanon do not imply any threats from Syria to
other parties.
</P>
<P>
Shazli told reporters that Netanyahu's government is unaware of
the dangers of the failure of the Middle East peace process because of
the negative Israeli practices.

<HEADLINE> Survey Finds More Users Taking Direct Route to Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A survey of home computer
users has found for the first time, more people are gaining access
to the Internet through direct Internet services than through
commercial on-line services, the New York Times said today.
</P>
<P>
The findings of the semiannual Homefront survey by Odyssey Inc.
of San Francisco said that 48 percent of all households connected
to the Internet used an Internet Service provider like Netcom and
AT&AMP;T Worldnet, compared with 35 percent who used a commercial
on-line service like America Online and Compuserve.
</P>
<P>
However, the paper said, just six months ago 54 percent of
households with Internet access used a commercial on-line service,
as against 30 percent for the Internet providers.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the service providers, who typically offer home computer
users access to the Internet but little else, the commercial
on-line services create a self-contained world of services and
features available only to paying members.
</P>
<P>
The survey data also indicated that 14 percent of all
households in the United States now have access to the Internet or
to an on-line service. Over all, 36 percent of all households have
a personal computer of some sort, which means that on-line
households are still a minority even among PC households.
</P>
<P>
Among households that have an on-line connection, electronic
mail emerged in the survey as the most popular application,
followed by research, news and information gathering. The least
popular applications were home banking, on-line shopping and
making hotel and airline reservations.

<HEADLINE> French Attorney Blames British Airways for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- An attorney general for the
Appeal Court of Paris today blamed British Airways for a 1990
hostage crisis in Kuwait, which was caused by the landing of an
airliner of the company in Kuwait City hours after the Iraqi
invasion.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Georgette Benas said that British Airways (BA)
no doubt "committed a fault" by landing the BA 149 passenger
plane with some 65 passengers on board in Kuwait City on August 1,
1990, but she said that the fault "isn't inexcusable."
</P>
<P>
All the passengers, including some Frenchmen, became "guests"
of President Saddam Hussein and served as "human shields" for
three months during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
She said that the action of taking the passengers hostage by
Iraqi troops was not "previsible" and this action resulted from
"a brutally degraded situation in Iraq."
</P>
<P>
The Paris Appeal Court will decide on November 12 whether to
support the lawsuit against BA by some former French hostages#,who
are asking for compensation for the psychological and physical
hardships during their detention by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Attorney Benas also said that the Warsaw Convention on
guaranteeing the security of ground and maritime passengers should
be extended to air travel.
</P>
<P>
She said that BA should be responsible for the security of its
passengers during the flight and during "all operations of
embarking and disembarking of passengers", and protect them
throughout the time when they were under its guide, such as by
evacuating them from the plane and sending them to a safe hotel.
</P>
<P>
Some of the former hostages suspect that the BA landed the
passenger plane in Kuwait in order to drop 30 British secret
agents in Kuwait on spy missions after the Iraqi invasion.
</P>
<P>
Gilbert Parleani and Dominique Menard, two lawyers for the
former French hostages, said that the fault committed by BA was
"extremely serious and inexcusable" because it landed innocent
civilians on a land of war engaging "the third largest army of
the world."
</P>
<P>
They said that "a bunch of elements" led one to think that
the reason for BA not to change its route to land in nearby
Bahrain was that it wanted to drop 30 British agents in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Some passengers said that the plane took off two hours late
from London, before some 30 young men "whose manners were
different from those of other passengers" embarked the plane.
</P>
<P>
Some British newspapers and a book published in London also
claimed that London wanted to send spies into Kuwait "by one
blow" after Saddam Hussein invaded the sheikhdom.
</P>
<P>
Fernand Garnault, attorney for BA, said that the commander of
the crew of BA 149 was reassured several times before and during
the flight that his plane could land without problem.
</P>
<P>
"It is true that there were Iraqi soldiers on the (Kuwaiti)
frontier, but difficulties had existed for a long time between
Iraq and Kuwait," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the hostages could be saved "by someone else than
British Airways" and that moreover, the passengers were entitled
to compensations from the Funds of Guarantee of Victims of Acts of
Terrorism.

<HEADLINE> Angola Urges Int'l Community to Aid Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Minister of
External Relations Venancio de Moura today called for a new
"Marshall Plan" before the end of this century to help Africa
through its social and economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the general debate of the 51st session of the U.N.
General Assembly, de Moura said that the crisis that is currently
afflicting the global economy is mostly structural in nature, and
results from the lack of consistency, lack of coordination and
adoption of macro economic policies incompatible with the growth
needs of the developing world.
</P>
<P>
"Of great concern is the realization that the current growth
rate of some of our countries is often negative, compelling whole
populations to lead lives of starvation and extreme poverty," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"It is unfair to know that at the threshold of the third
millennium, we still have 800 million malnourished people across
the world," he added.
</P>
<P>
On Africa, he said that it is the continent most lacking in
capital and technologies and, as a result, its population growth
far exceeds its food production capacity.
</P>
<P>
He considered that one of the basic keys to the economic and
social development lies in the expansion and re-orientation of
economic cooperation for development.
</P>
<P>
"We must map out as soon as possible a global developmental
strategy that will contribute to the solution of the problems now
affecting the survival of our economies," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the debt issue, he said that for the lesser developed
nations, the sole viable solution is total forgiveness for the
debt and a massive effort in the area of international cooperation
for development of partnerships.
</P>
<P>
He called on strengthening south-south cooperation and regional
economic integration, which will pave the way for the
establishment of more equitable new international orders and free
from measures of protectionism.
</P>
<P>
De Moura also expressed supports of the General Assembly
resolutions appealing for the lifting of the economic blockade and
in favor of the Cuban people, who suffer under the negative of
effects of that measures.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- China is willing to
further enhance its traditional friendship and cooperation with
Ethiopia, Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen said here today.
</P>
<P>
Qian, also Chinese foreign minister, made the remarks during a
meeting with his Ethiopian counterpart, Seyoum Mesfin, at the
United Nations headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Qian noted the smooth development of relations and successful
cooperation in various fields between China and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
He said the successful visit by Chinese President Jiang Zemin
to Ethiopia in May and the China-tour by Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi last year have laid a strong foundation to the
all-round development of the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Qian appreciated Ethiopia's "one China" policy and the support
to China on the issue of human rights.
</P>
<P>
He also appreciated Ethiopia's contributions in the African and
regional affairs.
</P>
<P>
Seyoum agreed with Qian's views on the bilateral ties and added
that Ethiopia was satisfied with the growth of friendly ties
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed China's constructive role in the international and
regional affairs and said China has a special position in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Seyoum introduced to Qian Africa's situation and the African
nations' efforts in resolving regional problems.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed China's satisfaction over African people's
progress in their development and said China hopes that related
regions in Africa could, through dialogues, reduce their
differences, eliminate the root of instability and maintain
stability so as to achieve development," said the Chinese leader.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Turkey Agree to Curb Saddam's Influence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
assured by Turkey that it supports U.S. policy on Iraq and would
not encourage Saddam Hussein to extend his influence in northern
Iraq, a State Department spokesman said on Monday in New York.
</P>
<P>
Nicholas Burns said Secretary of State Warren Christopher and
Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller, both of whom are in New
York to attend the United Nations General Assembly, held 40-minute
talks, in which Christopher was satisfied that Turkey assured him
not to collaborate with Saddam.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of today's meeting, Turkey and the United States
firmly agree that Saddam's influence in northern Iraq should be
minimized," said Burns.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times on Saturday published an interview with
Ciller, who was quoted by the newspaper as saying that her
government was talking with Saddam about establishing enough
control in northern Iraq to chase out Turkish Kurds waging a
separatist guerrilla war against Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Burns said Ciller's earlier reported remarks "caused some
anxiety in Washington", since the Clinton administration is
striving to minimize Saddam's influence in the region and has
resorted to military action to hem him in further.
</P>
<P>
Ciller told reporters before meeting with Christopher that she
had been misunderstood by the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"We are worried about the security of our borders," she said.
"We want to stop the influx of refugees through our borders. But
we cannot ask Saddam to do that for us", because Turkey respects
U.N. resolutions concerning Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We have lived up to all that was asked from us by the United
States," she added.
</P>
<P>
Ciller told Christopher during their talks that Turkey has
established a "security zone" in northern Iraq to block
cross-border incursions by the Kurdish Kurds who are fighting a
separatist war from bases in norther Iraq and increasing their
attacks on Turkish government forces.
</P>
<P>
Christopher told Ciller that the Clinton administration did not
object to the "security zone" so long as it was not permanent.
</P>
<P>
"He said the United States will continue to support the Turkish
security zone, that our understanding is that it would be
temporary in duration, and Mrs. Ciller concurred in that," Burns
said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Strongly Condemns Hegemony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign
Minister Ali-Akbar Velayati today strongly condemned hegemony
which flouts justice, freedom, participation, rule of law,
tolerance, human rights, pluralism and democracy in a dangerous
and unprecedented manner.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the first day of the general debate of the 51st
session of the U.N. General Assembly, Velayati said that
concurrent with the expansion of participatory democracy in many
countries, a complex movement has emerged toward international
autocracy and totalitarianism.
</P>
<P>
The evident behavioral characteristics of this menace can be
summerized as following:
</P>
<P>
-- unilateralism: total lack of commitment to mutual
cooperation and common solutions, and complete reliance on
unilateral measures in various fields;
</P>
<P>
-- opportunism: resort to international forum only as mechanisms
for promotion of national self-interest and often in pursuit of
domestic agenda;
</P>
<P>
-- secrecy; insistence on dogmatic, non-transparent and closed
methods and rejection of transparency;
</P>
<P>
-- lawlessness: evasion of the rule of law coupled with
audacity in breaking the law and universal norms, even in public
and official manner;
</P>
<P>
-- imposition: promotion of domestic agenda and national
priorities through imposition of policies on others, including
through extra-territorial application of domestic legislation; and
</P>
<P>
-- coercion: unbridled resort to the threat and use of force in
international political, economic and commercial relations.
</P>
<P>
However, the most notable manifestation of the new
international totalitarianism surfaces in the cultural sphere, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Our world is one characterized by diversity of religions,
civilizations, cultures and customs. This diversity has naturally
resulted in the emergence of many systems of law and values, with
similarities as well as differences," he said.
</P>
<P>
Regrettably, the claimants of world leadership have either
failed to grasp this self-evident reality due to their own lack of
historical and cultural depth or have found it incompatible with
their interests and thereby attempt to neglect it, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the international community to condemn and reject
all forms of terrorism, regardless of the identity of victims or
perpetrators, and irrespective of their political tendencies and
objectives.

<P>
PARIS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Three mortuary workers were
given suspended sentences of three to six months in jail by a
court in Pontoise, 50 kilometers north of Paris, for "passive
corruption" in leading the families of the dead to a funeral
director's company which paid them commissions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Claude Glanzman, manager of the New Agglomeration
Funeral Director's Company of Cergy-Pontoise, was convicted of
"active corruption" and was given a suspended sentence of six
months in jail.
</P>
<P>
The court also gave one franc (0.2 U.S. dollars) of
compensation to a rivaling funeral director's company -- the
Funeral Director's Company of Cergy-Pontoise, which claimed that
it had been inflicted with more than one million francs (200,000
U.S. dollars) of loss by the unfair competition from its rival.
</P>
<P>
Dominique Douet, Ernest Margain and Yannick Peufly, who worked
in the mortuary of the central hospital of Pontoise, said that
they only received tips sometimes from the funeral director's
company for doing extra works.
</P>
<P>
A dozen families of the dead said that the three men
"effectively guided them to choose which organizer of funeral
ceremonies."

<HEADLINE> Foreign Direct Investment Soars with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The business
globalization is accelerating at a dramatic pace, indicated by a
surge of foreign direct investment, according to the 1996 World
Investment Report published today by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Total foreign direct investment into developed and developing
countries surged by 40 percent in 1995, to reach 315 billion U.S.
dollars, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
About 100 billion U.S. dollars went into developing countries,
a gain of 15 percent on 1994. "China alone took in more than 38
billion U.S. dollars," it says.
</P>
<P>
"China played a key role in attracting foreign investment among
developing countries," said Georg Kell, an official with the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) which
prepared the annual report.
</P>
<P>
Kell said the figure was 4 billion U.S. dollars more than that
in 1994. "For this year, we expect a slight decrease, a temporary
adjustment due to some new policies introduced in China," he said.
However, he added, China would undoubtedly retain its very
important position as a host country for foreign direct
investment.
</P>
<P>
Foreign direct investment into Asia continued to boom, he said.
Asia absorbed about two-thirds of all foreign direct investment
inflows into developing countries.
</P>
<P>
U.S. retained its absolute lead both in terms of inflows and
outflows, according to the report. In 1995, about 60 billion U.S.
dollars were invested in the U.S. by foreign transnational
companies and the U.S. was the home country of nearly 100 billion-
U.S.-dollar outflows of foreign direct investment.
</P>
<P>
The report says foreign direct investment between Western
Europe and the United States set new records and was dominated by
mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
However, growth of investment into Asia may well outpace growth
into Europe in the future, the U.N. official said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign direct investment inflows are still highly
concentrated, the report says. The smallest 100 recipient
countries received only 1 percent of total investment. The top 10
largest recipient countries accounted for 68 percent of the 315
billion U.S. dollars of inflows.
</P>
<P>
Latin America attracted about 27 percent of all foreign direct
investment to developing countries, with two-thirds of this
accounted for by just four countries.
</P>
<P>
In Africa over the past couple of years, annual investment
flows to the continent have been around 5 billion U.S. dollars
only, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Federal Deficit Declines in First 11 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. federal deficit,
which totaled 144 billion dollars in the first 11 months, declined
by 15.9 percent from the same period of fiscal 1995, U.S. Treasury
Department announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that the government deficit of fiscal year
of 1996 ending on September 30 probably will be the smallest
annual imbalance in seven years.
</P>
<P>
It said that the deficit probably will end the year less than
144 billion dollars, because September usually winds up with a
surplus from quarterly income tax payments.
</P>
<P>
It would be the fourth straight annual decline after the
deficit peaked at a record 290.4 billion dollars in 1992 and
probably the lowest since 152.5 billion in fiscal 1989.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration forecast in July that the deficit
for the fiscal year would be 116.8 billion dollars, down from its
original forecast of 160.6 billion last spring.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government deficit in the first 11 months of last
fiscal year was 171.1 billion dollars and it was down to 163.9
billion at the end of fiscal 1995.
</P>
<P>
The last U.S. budget balance was in fiscal year of 1969 with a
surplus of 3.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Even with the size of the annual deficits of U.S. government
going down in the past four years, the total national debt has
increased to 5.1 trillion dollars now. The national debt in the
U.S. includes all the annual deficits since the country was
founded plus borrowings from government trust funds.

<HEADLINE> Britain Attacked for Suspending Cattle Slaughter Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
been criticized for unilaterally suspending its cattle slaughter
program and urged to stick to its agreement with the EU in a bid
to eradicate the BSE or mad cow disease, according to press
reports from Killarney, Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters during the three-day informal meeting of
EU agriculture ministers in the southern Irish town Killarney, EU
Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler said that "the beef crisis
is the biggest crisis we ever had in the European Union."
</P>
<P>
The EU agriculture ministers, deeply concerned over Britain's
decision to suspend the cattle slaughter program, have been trying
to persuade Britain to stick to its agreement with the EU to wipe
out the mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
The British government last Wednesday decided to put on hold
the slaughter of the 147,000 cattle most at risk of BSE in view of
the so-called new scientific findings that suggest the mad cow
disease would be over by the year 2001 without the planned
slaughter.
</P>
<P>
Fischler said this afternoon that "if the British do not
implement the cull, then it is clearly a breach of the Florence
agreement" reached in July by EU leaders.
</P>
<P>
"Every step taken in the wrong direction does not help to
restore confidence," he said.
</P>
<P>
The EU Agriculture Commissioner noted that there would be
formal discussion of Britain's attitude at the talks on Tuesday
when all EU ministers sit down together to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
"We need clear proposals and clear signals to the farmers and
to the consumers and that must be the discussion tomorrow," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg said that
Britain would work with its EU partners to implement the Florence
agreement, but he made no reference to his govenment's decision to
suspend the cattle slaughter program.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed the global ban on British beef products exports
on March 27 when the British government admitted that there were
possible links between mad cow disease and its human equivalent
Creutzfeldt Jacob Disease.
</P>
<P>
EU leaders agreed at the Florence Summit in June to gradually
lift the ban on British beef exports on the condition that Britain
should implement a series of tough measures, including the
slaughter of those cattle most at risk from the mad cow disease.

<HEADLINE> EU Official Appeals for Ratification of Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- An EU (European Union)
official today urged EU member nations and African, Caribbean and
Pacific (ACP) countries to speed up the process of ratification of
the revised Lome-IV convention.
</P>
<P>
Joao de Deus Pinheiro, EU commissioner in charge of relations
with ACP group members, made the appeal Monday at an ACP-EU
round-table conference held in Luxembourg, according to a press
release issued here today.
</P>
<P>
"The ratification only took place in two EU member nations and
16 ACP countries," the commissioner said at the conference.
</P>
<P>
He asked the participants in the conference to play their due
roles to step up the process of the ratification in their nations
of origin and thus make the convention go into effect. The
convention includes the 8th European Development Funds (EDF).
</P>
<P>
The commissioner said, "More than ever, I am convinced that we
will have the credibility of our partnership."
</P>
<P>
In order to make the convention go into effect and ACP
countries benefit from the 8th EDF, the convention should be
ratified by at least two-thirds of the 70 ACP countries and all
the EU member nations.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs U.S. 1997 Defense Spending Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton today signed the U.S. defense spending authorization bill
for the next fiscal year beginning on October 1.
</P>
<P>
The bill, providing a total of 265.6 billion U.S. dollars for
the Pentagon, is 11 billion U.S. dollars more than Clinton
requested.
</P>
<P>
While providing billions more for military research and the
purchase of new weapons than the Pentagon sought, the legislation
also gives a three percent pay increases for American military
personnel and the 4.6 percent increase in the allowance for
off-base living quarters.
</P>
<P>
"This legislation will increase the security of our country and
our families," Clinton declared at a special ceremony at the White
House. "This bill will allow our armed forces to remain the best
trained, best prepared fighting force on earth."
</P>
<P>
The authorization carries forth the U.S. Defense Department's
modernization programs by funding crucial weapons systems,such as
the F-22 fighters, the Comanche helicopters and the V-22 Osprey.

<HEADLINE> IFOR Seizes Weapons from Bosnian Muslim Returnees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 23 (Xinhua) -- The multinational peace
Implementation Force (IFOR) seized weapons from Muslims who
returned to the village of Jusici near Zvornik in the northern
part of Bosnian Serb territory.
</P>
<P>
IFOR spokesman Maj. Simon Haselock said in Sarajevo on Monday
that more than a dozen pieces of weaponry banned under the Dayton
peace accords had been confiscated from Muslims who began
returning to the village on Friday, according to Tanjug news
agency.
</P>
<P>
Another IFOR officer said about 100 Muslims had come to the
village, most of whom wanted to return home, but some with arms.
</P>
<P>
The armed men were suspected to be soldiers in civilian clothes
sent by the Muslim army, IFOR officials said.
</P>
<P>
IFOR troops are patrolling the village and monitoring
developments from nearby hills.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bosnian Serb Interior Minister Dragan Kijac said
Monday Serb authorities had asked the Muslims to leave Jusici and
Serb police would take control of the village.
</P>
<P>
IFOR spokesman Maj. Brett Boudreau said refugees could return
home only where it was safe, and that return to sensitive border
areas had to be gradual, with the help of international refugee
agencies.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR: 646,000 Refugees Housed in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 23 (Xinhua) -- A UNHCR official said here
Monday there are 646,066 refugees or displaced persons living in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Mission chief of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) in Belgrade, Margaret O'keeffe, told a press conference
that this was the official results of the registration of refugees
performed in Yugoslavia between April 15 and June 30 of this year.
</P>
<P>
The registration figures showed that more than 60 percent of
the total refugees had decided in favor of integrating themselves
into local communities in Yugoslavia, while 23 percent were either
"undecided," "uncertain" or had "no answer."
</P>
<P>
This means that Yugoslavia, which is comprised of Serbia and
Montenegro, with its enfeebled economy and exhausted households,
should absorb nearly half a million homeless, which was
"unthinkable," O'keeffe said.
</P>
<P>
This was why, she added, the UNHCR would go on assisting these
people and would also have to appeal on the international
community, agencies and donors to extend a broad-based financial
support to the integration of as many refugees as this.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR held that the question of the property of Serbs
expelled from Croatia should be resolved in the same way as that
of the property of refugees from Bosnia, because Croatia did sign
the Dayton agreement and the provisions of the accords should
therefore be applied to Croatia too.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Serbia's commissioner for refugees Bratislava
Morina told the same press conference that the recent
normalization of relations between Yugoslavia and Croatia and the
successful elections in Bosnia would encourage the return of
refugees and the resolution of the question of their legal
property and status.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum was being drafted on the voluntary return of
refugees to the Bosnian Serb entity Republika Srpska from Serbia,
she added.
</P>
<P>
During the three-and-half-year war in Bosnia, more than 2
million people had become refugees or displaced persons. About
600,000 fled to other countries outside the former Yugoslav region
and more than 600,000 in Yugoslavia. So far, only hundreds of
refugees have returned to Bosnia from abroad.

NEW YORK, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson testified in
court on Monday that he got mad with former trainer Kevin Rooney
after the latter unveiled his personal life to media.
</P>
<P>
Sued for breach of contract, Tyson stood in the federal court
in Albany for three hours in a case filed by Rooney for 49 million
US dollars.

Rooney, who started his first training with Tyson in 1982, said
Tyson had broken his word by firing him after the death of mentor
Cus D'Amato in 1985.

After Rooney's criticism went public in media, Tyson got angry
and fired the former trainer.

<HEADLINE> Hi-tech Industry Becomes Pillar of Yantai Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JI'NAN, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Hi-tech industry in China's
port city Yantai has become a leader in the local economy, a
government official there said recently.
</P>
<P>
Yantai, in east China's Shandong Province, has established 406
enterprises that develop or manufacture hi-tech products,
accounting for a quarter of the city's total.
</P>
<P>
Hi-tech enterprises generated a total output value of 6.2
billion yuan (about 747 million US dollars) and 1.6 billion yuan
in taxes and profits last year.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Yantai has implemented the strategy of
"invigorating the city's economy through science and technology,"
and has given favorable treatment to hi-tech enterprises in land
use, funding, power supply and intelligence.
</P>
<P>
Large state-owned enterprises have pioneered the development of
hi-tech industries. The city has selected 100 enterprises to
upgrade traditional industries and old products.
</P>
<P>
The Yantai Wanhua Synthetic Leather Group Company has broken
the monopoly of foreign technology in the development of
high-grade imitation synthetic leather.
</P>
<P>
By keeping up-to-date with the latest global developments in
technology, the Polaris Clock Corporation has become the largest
clock company in China.
</P>
<P>
Technology-intensive joint ventures have also sprung up in the
city. Most of the 150 projects boast state-of-the-art technology,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
Yantai presently has one of the four largest manufacturing
bases of transparent electric conduction glass in the world, which
was formed in cooperation with an American company.
</P>
<P>
By cooperating with another US company, the city has produced a
special sealing gum, which satisfies 90 percent of the demand of
the country's market.
</P>
<P>
Yantai has also cooperated with a Japanese company for the
production of automobile air conditioners. The city also joined
hands with a company from the Republic of Korea to make
excavators, a project that is expected to generate an output value
of one billion US dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
Township enterprises also play an active role in the
development of hi-tech products. Household appliances developed by
the Hongxiang Company sells well in the overseas market. Last
year, the company turned out a production volume of 1.3 billion
yuan. And Zhichu Group, a village-run company, has developed 28
hi-tech products.
</P>
<P>
The city has set up 450 hi-tech industries, covering the fields
of electronic information, integration of machinery and
electronics, new materials, bio-engineering, mechanics, medicine,
and household appliances.

<HEADLINE> Qian Qicheng Meets EU Troika Foreign Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qicheng Monday urged the European Union to
take more active steps to support China's efforts in entering the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
He made this remark during his meeting with his counterparts of
the European Union Troika here in New York.
</P>
<P>
Qian pointed out that in recent years the overall relationship
between China and EU is developing in a good direction.
</P>
<P>
He said China values the important role the EU and its members
are playing in the international affairs and wishes to develop
friendly and cooperative relationship with them.
</P>
<P>
On economic and trade relations, Qian said there is great
potential for development since the two sides are economically
complementary.
</P>
<P>
He said China will continue the process of opening up to the
outside world and liberalizing its trade practices.
</P>
<P>
He called upon the EU countries to take more positive steps in
eliminating protective trade barriers against Chinese products and
to take positive and concrete measures on the questions of China's
entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring, the current EU president,
told Qian that EU is determined in pursuing the long-term policy
of developing strategic relationship with China.
</P>
<P>
Noting the dialogue between China and EU has already had a good
beginning, Dick said that the EU is willing to continue such a
dialogue so as to enhance understanding and reduce differences.
</P>
<P>
Spring told Qian that the EU supports China's entry into the
World Trade Organization, hoping the question can be solved on an
equal and just base.
</P>
<P>
On the human rights issue, Qian reaffirmed China's consistent
policy that is to carry out dialogues with other countries on the
basis of equality and mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
China believes that dialogues and confrontation cannot be mixed
together. If any country wishes to seek dialogues (with China), it
should discard the stance of confrontation, he added.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the European Union, Hans Van Mierlo expressed his
gratitude for the flexibility and constructive spirit China had
demonstrated in the negotiations for settling the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). He said China had made important
contribution to the successful adoption of the treaty earlier this
months.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice-premier said that China had been actively
involved in the CTBT negotiations, holding that it would be the
first step taken toward the final target of a comprehensive ban
and complete destruction of nuclear weapons. He said the
international community should continue its efforts in this
regard.

<TEXT>
<P>
JI'NAN, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Kite-flying, a hobby that
dates back 2,500 years in Weifang, has helped the local economy
take off.
</P>
<P>
The east China city has hosted 13 kite flying festivals since
1984, which have attracted large sums of overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Weifang brought in 443 million US dollars of overseas
capital, more than double the amount in 1992.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, the city had used 3.2 billion yuan (about
386 million US dollars) of overseas investment and more than 1,300
overseas enterprises had been set up in the city.
</P>
<P>
Output value of the city soared from five billion to 40 billion
yuan during the 1983-1994 period, said a leading city official.
</P>
<P>
At the 12th International Kite Flying Festival in 1995, 2,000
businessmen from 29 countries and regions concluded 2,200 projects
with the city, located in Shandong Province.

<HEADLINE> Tourism Environment Better in Huangguoshu Waterfall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The once-barren environment
surrounding Asia's biggest waterfall has been transformed into a
rich forest area.
</P>
<P>
Huangguoshu Waterfall in southwest China's Guizhou Province
attracts large numbers of domestic and overseas tourists every
year.
</P>
<P>
The waterfall, 81 meters wide and 69 meters high, has long been
the trump card in the province's tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
The region around the waterfall is karst, which makes it
difficult to grow trees and grassland, large areas of mountains in
the region were barren a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
So to protect the rich tourism resource, the region's tourist
bureau planted 520,000 trees and turned a total of 26,000 square
meter areas into grass lands.
</P>
<P>
The bureau has also signed 30-year-long contracts to rent large
areas of land on the upper reaches of the waterfall to farmers for
tree-planting.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the bureau's effort, the forest coverage rate in
the region has increased from three percent to 13 percent.

<HEADLINE> Telephone Anti-Fakes Electronic Code System in Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, September 24 (Xinhua) -- A high-tech system that uses
secret codes to combat fake goods in China is to go national after
a successful trial operation.
</P>
<P>
The system, invented by Chinese experts, uses a telephone
network and electronic codes to identify genuine articles. A
national work conference called to discuss the system has been
told it is to be spread nationwide after proving successful.
</P>
<P>
Its trial operation in parts of the country since January this
year received positive response from users.
</P>
<P>
China Anti-Fakes Association is entrusted by the State Bureau
of Technical Supervision to popularize it throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Hainan Tenglong Anti-Fake Technology Company, which is based in
Haikou, provincial capital of Hainan in South China, is
responsible for implementing the project.
</P>
<P>
The system, based on computerized data banks and the national
computerized telephone information retrieval network, will provide
manufacturers of quality products with special data codes and
secret codes.
</P>
<P>
Commodity dealers or buyers can check up the goods they have
purchased by telephone, after tearing off the cover on the codes.
</P>
<P>
Since it is a hi-tech system, it is impossible for anyone to
produce fake codes, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
The Hainan-based company has invested 40 million yuan to set up
a data bank capable of holding 50 billion different electronic
codes. Terminals will be built in major cities across the country.
</P>
<P>
Some experts say the network will help protect quality and
brand-famed products in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, September 24 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Machinery
plans to finance major machine-building plants in northeast China
to help them launch technological upgrade projects.
</P>
<P>
The aim is to boost the fortunes of an important sector that
employs a quarter of all the area's workers.
</P>
<P>
The companies to receive government assistance will include
manufacturers of power generation, transformers and transmission
facilities, lathe-builders and suppliers of important fittings and
parts in the bearing industry.
</P>
<P>
The funding will also be granted to manufacturers of light and
heavy automotives, according to Deputy Minister Sun Changji, who
was recently interviewed by Xinhua in Liaoning coastal city Dalian.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, 104 such projects have been approved
by the ministry, involving a total investment of 5.3 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The northeastern region normally covers Heilongjiang, Jilin and
Liaoning, as well as the eastern part of Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region. The area is an old industrial base of the country.
</P>
<P>
The machinery industry makes up 25.73 percent of the region's
total industrial production value.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has urged the machinery sector in the northeast to
carry out ideological and managerial reforms to revive the old
industrial base.

<HEADLINE> China Expected to Produces Record 46 Million tons of Fruit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to produce
a record 46 million tons of fruit this year, greatly easing the
country's fruit shortage.
</P>
<P>
Supply sources say that the present time is the peak season for
the fruit harvest, and a survey shows there will be a bumper
harvest, which may in turn ease the fruit supply and help cut
prices.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade or so the reform and opening-up policy has
led to fruit production enjoying a fast growth.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995 fruit plantation areas reached eight
million hectares, with an annual production of 42.14 million tons,
20.4 percent over that of 1994.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that as the country's fruit production may top
46 million tons, fruit supply shortages will ease with the good
prospect of cheaper prices in shops and markets for buyers.
