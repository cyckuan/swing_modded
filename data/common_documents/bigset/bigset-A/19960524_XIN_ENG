Meeting with the visiting five-member Chinese press delegation

foreign policy, he stressed, adding that Pakistan and China share
many common views on international issues.

He expressed thanks to the Chinese government and people for
their remarkable support and assistance to the Pakistani
government and people in times of need.

friendship will be further enhanced in all fields, especially in
the economic field.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Ministers Asked to Clear Property Purchase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong announced in parliament today that government ministers must
clear any purchase of private properties with the prime minister
to preserve "the government's reputation of incorruptibility and
integrity."
</P>
<P>
Goh made the statement at the end of a three-day parliament
debate on the soft launch purchases of private properties by
Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew and Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien
Loong in April last year.
</P>
<P>
In those purchases, according to local press reports, the
developer offered the two ministers discounts of five percent,
seven percent, and 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
Market talks and coffee-shop rumors prompted the prime minister
to initiate an investigation into the purchases by the two
ministers.
</P>
<P>
Goh said today that he had been satisfied "very early on that
there was no impropriety."
</P>
<P>
But he also noted that public concern over soft launches and
discounts had mounted in the past few months because of the
frenzied state of the property market.
</P>
<P>
In a hot market, where properties can sometimes be resold
immediately at large profits, and when even places in the queue at
the developer's office may worth a lot, ministers have to be extra
careful, he said.
</P>
<P>
Describing soft launches and discounts as usual and normal
practice in the property market, Goh admitted, however, "I
recognized the possibility of abuse. Some developers may use soft
launches and discounts to cultivate ministers, members of the
parliament, and civil servants."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that though there is no wrongdoing at present, the
government's standards of integrity might be eroded over time.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister pointed out that buying properties at soft
launches in a heated market could create a "perception problem."
</P>
<P>
He said that even if there is no question of impropriety, the
public would resent the apparently privileged access of elected
leaders and public officers to soft launches.
</P>
<P>
Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew and Deputy Prime Minister Lee
Hsien Loong spoke and offered facts on their property purchases at
the debate in the parliament.

HAVANA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Evgueni
Primakov today described his country's ties with Cuba as positive
and stressed that "we are on the verge of the apogee in our
relations."
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, the Russian foreign minister said
relations between Russia and Cuba are based on the principle of
equal rights and non-interference in internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
the Russian diplomat reiterated his country's rejection of the
U.S. Helms-Burton Bill which tightens the economic blockade
imposed by the United States on Cuba more than 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Primakov also revealed that he has invited Cuban Foreign
Minister Roberto Robaina to visit Moscow after the presidential
elections in Russia in June.
</P>
<P>
Constructive talks and the signing of other documents will
continue in Moscow during the Cuban minister's visit.
</P>
<P>
Before the press conference, the two ministers held talks and
signed cooperation agreements on education, culture and science
and technology for the period of 1996-1998 and a protocol on the
principles governing the two countries' relations.

<HEADLINE> British Business Leaders Back Government's Beef Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- British business leaders Wednesday
backed Prime Minister John Major's policy of non-cooperation with
Europe over the worldwide ban on British beef despite fears
that it could badly damage business interests and further
encourage the Tory Euro-sceptics.
</P>
<P>
Colin Marshall, who took over Wednesday as president of the
organization representing British business, the Confederation of
British Industry (CBI), told a regular meeting of the CBI's ruling
council that he "strongly agreed" with Major's policy of
non-cooperation with the European Union (EU) which imposed the ban
after a health scare that "mad cow" disease, a fatal brain disease
affecting cattle, could spread to humans.
</P>
<P>
"I would not have thought that the position the PM took is
particularly going to encourage any more the efforts of the
Euro-sceptics," he said. "I do not anticipate this tactic is going
to have an effect on business."
</P>
<P>
Marshall was backed by the outgoing CBI president, Bryan
Nicholson, who said that "we entirely understand why he (the PM)
has taken the stance he has and the business position has to be
one of sympathy'" because "an assertion of your national interest
is quite legitimate."
</P>
<P>
He rejected suggestions that Major's stance could render
Britain a "semi-detached" member of the EU or allow the
Euro-sceptics to hijack government policy on Europe.
</P>
<P>
Amid the beef ban row with the EU, the Prime Minister lost his
patience Tuesday and threatened to disrupt normal EU business
unless rapid progress was made on lifting the global ban on
British beef product exports.

PHNOM PENH, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk,
now in the Chinese capital of Beijing for medical checkups, said
he is worried about the deteriorating political situation at home.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to his son Norodom Ranariddh, Cambodia's First
Prime Minister, Sihanouk said he will never do anything violating
the country's constitution and will not meddle in the affairs of
the government and the two prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh read the letter to the public at a mass rally marking
the third anniversary of the general elections in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
As the Cambodian king, he should stay with his people though
his health is not in a good condition, Sihanouk said.
</P>
<P>
Tension heightened in Cambodia over power struggles between the
two ruling parties, the FUNCINPEC headed by Ranariddh and the
Cambodian People's Party (CPP) led by Second Prime Minister Hun
Sen.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Find Fossil of Monkey Living 10,000 Years Ago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Two scientists have discovered in
the Amazon jungle what was believed to be the fossil of a giant
monkey living more than 10,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The scientists, Cartelle of the Universidad Federal de Minas
Gerais in Brazil and Walter Hartwig of George Washington
University of the United States, reported the finding in the
journal Nature published today.
</P>
<P>
The monkey, named Protopithecus brasiliensis, partly after the
place of its origin, lived in the treetops of the jungle in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Estimated to be twice as big as the present South American
counterparts, the ancient species, weighing about 25 kilograms,
had strong arms and a huge voice-box.
</P>
<P>
A complete skeleton of the animal was recovered, for the first
time, from a cave in the Brazilian state of Bahia.
</P>
<P>
The scientists assumed that the monkey went extinct as a result
of insufficient food caused by climate changes, mainly drier
weathers, on the continent over the 10,000 years.
</P>
<P>
The finding, they said, also suggested that South America was
more fertile then than it is today.

<HEADLINE> Computer Hackers Pose Threats to US Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Computer hackers posed a serious
and growing threat to national security, with the Pentagon
suffering more and more attacks on its computers, The New York
Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The number of unauthorized efforts to enter the Pentagon's
computer system was doubling every year and may have reached
250,000 in 1995, most of them made through the Internet, the
newspaper quoted a report from the General Accounting Office as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The report provided details on several recent attacks,
including a 1994 incident in which two hackers gained complete
access to the computer systems of the Air Force laboratory in
Rome, New York, where the Pentagon carries out some of its most
important research on weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
One of the hackers, a Briton whose code name was Datastream
Cowboy, was later attested in England. But the other hacker, whose
code name is Kuji, was never apprehended.
</P>
<P>
The report said the Pentagon had made itself vulnerable to
attack by making itself so dependent on computers and the
Internet, a system created by its own researchers in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon uses the Internet to distribute electronic mail
and other information. During the Gulf War, the Defense
Department used the Internet to communicate with allied armies
and gather and distribute intelligence information.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Ruling Party Willing to Talk with Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The top leader of South Korea's
ruling New Korea Party (NKP) said today his party is willing to
talk with the opposition to settle the current political impasse.
</P>
<P>
Lee Hong-koo, Chairman of the NKP, told a press conference that
the purpose of the his party's initiative is to assure that the
15th National Assembly can open on time.
</P>
<P>
"We will strive to do all we can for solving the political
confrontation so that the 15th legislature will be organized as
provided by the National Assembly law," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lee also formally proposed meetings with main opposition
leaders, Kim Dae-jung of the National Conference for New Politics
(NCNP) and Kim Jong-pil of the United Liberal Democrats (ULD).
</P>
<P>
"I would still like to meet with the presidents of the two
opposition parties," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the ruling party's recruitment of lawmakers-elect,
Lee brushed aside the opposition's criticism, claiming that "the
NKP's intention to conduct responsible politics with a parliament
majority should not be a cause for denunciation and struggle."
</P>
<P>
The current political impasse has been triggered by the ruling
party's recruitment of 11 independent and opposition
lawmakers-elect to secure a majority at the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
In the 15th South Korean National Assembly elections held on
April 11, the NKP headed by President Kim Young-sam won 139 seats,
11 short of a simple majority in the 299-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties denounced the ruling party for
recruiting independent and opposition lawmakers and asked for a
thorough investigation of all alleged election campaign ey also
declared that they will boycott the new parliament, which will
open early next month, if the ruling party fails to meet their
demand.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 23 (Xinhua) -- A draft law banning the use and
import of landmines has been prepared by the Cambodian Mines
Action Center (CMAC), a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Our draft of the law contains serious penalties against anyone

The draft law, which has been submitted to the Council of
Ministers, the cabinet, is expected to reach the National
Assembly, or parliament, later this year.
</P>
<P>
"Landmines in Cambodia will disappear when there is no more
war," said Chum Sambath, spokesman for the Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, 27,000 hectares of land has been
de-mined, resulting in the destruction of 55,700 anti-personnel

<HEADLINE> 36,000 Jobs Lost in UK BSE Crisis, With More Set to Go </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- So far 36,000 jobs in Britain are
estimated to have been lost due to the BSE (mad cow disease)
crisis and more job losses are expected in the next few days as
hard-pressed employers reacted to the news that there was no hope
of early reprieve to any kind of beef exports.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports said that although beef farmers in Britain
have complained most and received compensation and support from
the government, no jobs so far appear to have been lost.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, exporters, meat processing plants, hauliers, pie,
burger and sausage makers have all lost jobs.
</P>
<P>
The Transport and General Workers' Union said that its original
estimate was 10,000 jobs lost in the abattoir sector but when the
associated meat processing and food manufacturing were added, it
grew to 36,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
Peter Currie, one of the union officials going to Brussels on
June 5 to plead with the European Commission for emergency funds,
said, "Our estimates based on reports from employers round the
country is that 36,000 have lost their jobs and the numbers are
going up daily."
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the accountancy firm Coopers and Lybrand
expects 6,000 to 8,000 jobs in the abattoir sector to go over the
next year and 15,000 to 20,000 in the food processing business.

The statement said here at home on the occasion of Africa
Liberation Day, the PAC demanded the immediate release of all
black African freedom fighters from South African prisons,

<HEADLINE> Gasoline Prices Steady, Declining in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Gasoline prices in the U.S.,
which had been soaring during the past months, are stabilizing and
the prospect for lower prices is improving.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent survey conducted by the U.S. Energy
Department, the average price of the regular gasoline was 1.28
U.S. dollars a gallon as of May 17, slightly lower than the price
of 1.28 dollars in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
The decline resulted from an increase of oil supply in the
country. According to the newest figure released by the American
Petroleum Institute this week, gasoline supplies rose by 1.85
million barrels, or about 1 percent, to 204.9 million barrels for
the week ending May 17.
</P>
<P>
Gasoline prices in the U.S. rose by an average of 20 cents a
gallon from early February to mid-May.
</P>
<P>
The average price of all kinds of gasoline surged to 1.36
dollars a gallon at the end of April and President Bill Clinton
ordered the sale of 12 million barrels of oil from the nation's
strategic petroleum reserve to drive down the prices.
</P>
<P>
The factors behind the soaring prices are yet to be found out.
But analysts said that one of the reasons was the sharp squeeze at
refineries that were unable to switch as much output to gasoline
because they were forced by the cold winter to produce heating oil
longer than normal.
</P>
<P>
Even as the gasoline prices are declining, the Republicans in
Congress are still taking advantage of the price-up to try to
repeal the 4.3 cent-a-gasoline tax increase which was imposed by
the government in 1993 but strongly opposed by the Republicans.

ISLAMABAD, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan has received only
35.6 million US dollars of aid by April 15, or 29 percent of the
124-million-dollar aid required for the period of October
1995-September 1996.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the United Nations Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance to Afghanistan (UNOCHA)

<P>
It will support the return of refugees from Iran and Pakistan
and meet the most immediate humanitarian needs of vulnerable
families in Afghanistan.
</P>

to bring essential relief supplies to the most vulnerable families
in Kabul during a particularly severe winter, said the press
release.
</P>
<P>
Had it not been for these efforts, many Kabulis would have been
unable to survive the winter, it noted.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Yeltsin to Start Talks to End Chechen War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 23 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin, campaigning
for re-election on June 16, intends to start talks to end the
17-month Chechen war as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
As Russian troops laid siege to the last stronghold of the
Chechen rebels in Bamut, Russian generals have strongly opposed
Yeltsin's well-publicized planned tour of Chechnya later this
month -- "it's impossible to provide 100 percent security
guarantees," said one.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant-General Andrei Ivanov, of the Russian general staff,
warned on Wednesday that Chechen rebel commander Shamil Basayev
was preparing a terrorist attack on Yeltsin during any trip to
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Chechen rebel separatists' leader Aelimkhan
Yandarbiyev proposed meeting Yeltsin in Makhachkala, capital of
Russia's republic of Daghestan which borders Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
However, Yeltsin's spokesman Sergei Medevedev said today that
"the venue is not important. What's important is the
result. Holding the talks in Moscow hasn't been ruled out."
</P>
<P>
He said that Yeltsin "wants the talks to begin as soon as
possible," and he is ready to hold talks with all parties
involved, and will guarantee all participants' safety.
</P>
<P>
Medevedev did not specify whether Yeltsin would cancel his tour
of Chechnya, announced earlier this month. Yeltsin said he had to
go to the breakaway republic as he was the only person who could
get all the warring parties to sit around the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
The village of Bamut in southwestern Chechnya, a former Soviet
missile base and now accommodating about 1,000 Chechen rebels, has
seen fierce fighting over the last few days in which some 160-180
rebels and dozens of Russian soldiers are reported killed or
wounded.
</P>
<P>
Official reports said earlier that Russian troops had captured
strategic heights south and east of Bamut, but have not yet
stormed the village for fear of causing huge casualties.
</P>
<P>
Viktor Ilyukhin, chairman of the security committee of the
State Duma (the lower house of the Russian parliament) said today
that Russian troops have lost about "70 soldiers and officers with
dozens wounded" around Bamut.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Ivanov revealed that the rebel commander Basayev, who
launched the infamous terrorist attack on Budennovsk in southern
Russia last summer, had set up three armed groups, each containing
40 people, to try to assassinate Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, hundreds of Basayev's
soldiers have moved out to the mountains near Kharachoi village in
the Vedeno region, about 45 kilometers southeast of the Chechen
capital Grozny.
</P>
<P>
More than 41,000 Russian troops now remain in Chechnya, about
19,000 of them from the defense ministry and the others (more than
22,000) from the interior ministry.
</P>
<P>
The total number of Chechen rebels, who are particularly active
in western Chechnya -- in the Achkhoi-Martan, Samashki and Bamut
regions -- stood at between 1,500 and 1,600, with an estimated
5,000-7,000 sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
There are up to 1,000 Chechen rebels, Ivanov estimated.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the constant tension, Sergei Stepashin, the
secretary of the State Commission for a Chechen Settlement,
claimed that if Yeltsin was still determined to visit Chechnya
himself, nobody could stop him.

<HEADLINE> Russian Troops Seize Bamut in Chechnya: Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian troops have seized one of
the major strongholds of Chechen rebels -- the village of Bamut in
southwestern Chechnya and begun their clearing operation there,
according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The reports cited Lieutenant-General Gennady Troshev, commander
of Russia's 58th army, as saying that the federal troops had
fought their way into Bamut earlier this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Most of Chechen rebel separatists entrenched in the village
have been killed, the general said, adding that only a small
number of rebels had escaped.
</P>
<P>
Troshev, back from the Bamut area, told a news conference in
Khakala, a suburb of the Chechen capital of Grozny, that the
federal army units are in a clearing operation in Bamut, searching
for separate rebel groups and ammunition dumps and clearing mines.
</P>
<P>
The general did not specify rebel losses, only saying that
bodies of mercenary soldiers were seen in the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
As for casualties of federal troops, Troshev said by the time
of his return to Khakhala, or 17:30 Moscow time (15:30 GMT), the
figures were 23 killed and 60 wounded. The figures are final, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that the fierce fighting between federal
troops and Chechen rebels had lasted several days. Among the up to
1,000 rebels fighting in or near Bamut, some 160-180 were killed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lieutenant-General Andrei Ivanov of the Russian
General Staff told reporters here that about 2,000 mercenaries,
including 200 from Afghanistan, are fighting on the side of
Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
Some 300 mercenaries were fighting in the village of Bamut, the
former Soviet missile base and a major stronghold of the Chechen
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Russian President Boris Yeltsin confirmed that he
is ready to begin talks with all parties involved in the
17-month-long Chechen war, including Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, the
leader of the Chechen separatists who took over after Dzhokhar
Dudayev's death.

<HEADLINE> Government to Talk with Labor over Privatization: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The South African government
will meet with labor representatives next month to decide how to
move ahead with restructuring state assets, Public Enterprises
Minister Stella Sigcau said today.
</P>
<P>
This followed the signing of the National Framework Agreement
(NFA) between the state and unions earlier this year on the
sensitive issue of privatization.
</P>
<P>
Addressing businessmen at the southern African economic summit
in Cape Town, Sigcau said before assets could be restructured the
government has to get its own operation in order first.
</P>
<P>
He said there has been a lot of talk that nothing has been
done since the signing of the NFA, but "this is untrue." Policies
have to be carefully evaluated and the right people to drive the
process of restructuring appointed.
</P>
<P>
However, the government's drive for privatization is strongly
opposed by the labor.
</P>
<P>
The Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) General
Secretary Sam Shilowa on Thursday reiterated his opposition to
privatization.
</P>
<P>
Shilowa said COSATU would meet the government and give its
proposals on the future of state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Finance Minister Trevor Manuel told delegates that
the government is aware of the pressure to restructure but has to
take account of lessons learned from around the world.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 southern African economic summit, which started on
Wednesday, is jointly organized by the world economic forum of
Geneva and the Southern African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
Political leaders from the SADC member states and about 400
businessmen around the world are attending the three-day summit.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Denies UN Set of Ideas on Negotiating Table </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
said here today that a U.N. set of ideas on solution to the
Cyprus problem, submitted to the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides
in 1992, is not on the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
The President made the remark following a statement Wednesday
by U.S. ambassador to Cyprus Richard Boucher that the set of
ideas of the U.N. chief still remains part of the negotiating
process to reach an overall settlement in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Boucher also stressed that the U.S. believes there is
obviously a relation between current efforts to settle the Cyprus
question and U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's set
of ideas.
</P>
<P>
In reply to questions by local reporters, President Clerides
said "in the contacts I have had, such issue has not been raised
by anybody nor has it been discussed."
</P>
<P>
"In any case, the set of ideas is not the basis on which we
are seeking to settle the Cyprus question," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. ideas cover the fundamental aspects of the Cyprus
problem, including the constitution, the guarantees and security
of a future federal bizonal, bicommunal Cyprus, territorial
adjustments as part of an overall settlement which would also
deal with the issue of displaced persons and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the U.S. ambassador's statement, government
spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides said Wednesday that the U.N. set
of ideas will be used as a reference point and not as a basis for
an overall agreement on the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the basic principles of the Cyprus problem are
the center of all contacts of the Cyprus government, and no
reference is made to the content of Boutros-Ghali's set of ideas.
</P>
<P>
"For three years now Ghali's ideas have not been used during
discussions as the framework for a solution to the Cyprus
problem," cassoulides said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and took control of northern third of the island following an
Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Cyprus official stand on the
U.N. chief's set of ideas on the Cyprus question was made only a
couple of weeks before a meeting in Washington between Clerides
and U.S. President Bill Clinton, during which the Cyprus problem
is expected to be high on the agenda.

<P>
PYONGYANG, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) will guarantee the rights and legal basis for
international personnel to work in building light-water nuclear
reactors in the country.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK and the Korea Peninsula Energy Development
Organization (KEDO) have reached an agreement on protecting
international personnel in a consular protocol signed today in New
York.
</P>
<P>
South Korea today hailed the agreement, saying in a Foreign
Ministry statement that it "paved the way for the KEDO to proceed
with" the DPRK's nuclear reactor project, said reports from Seoul.
</P>
<P>
According to the Washington-Pyongyang Geneva framework
agreement signed in October 1994, two 1,000-megawatt light-water
reactors will be provided to the DPRK in return for freezing its
nuclear program. South Korea is the prime supplier of the
light-water reactors.
</P>
<P>
Under the protocol, the KEDO will enjoy diplomatic privileges
and immunities similar to those granted to international
organizations like the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the KEDO staff and government representatives from
KEDO member countries will be granted privileges and immunities
similar to those given to diplomats.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement signed by the DPRK and the United
States in June last year, the KEDO, a multinational consortium led
by the U.S., South Korea and Japan, is responsible for supplying
two reactors to the DPRK.

today to plot the overall strategy to end the European Union's
(EU) global ban on British beef product exports.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, the British government set up a crisis
management group, or "+war cabinet," in a bid to implement the
government's non-cooperation policy with the EU.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting held at Downing Street this morning, Major
spent 40 minutes with British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind
and Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg to discuss the concrete
measures to be implemented in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Major was quoted by a BBC TV report as saying that the the
machinery was now in place to take forward the policy of
non-cooperation announced to the House of Commons Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The British government has now a clear strategy to ensure that
Europe realized that the British government meant business, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also discussed the domestic implications of the
policy and Public Service Minister Roger Freeman will coordinate
further action in that respect.
</P>
<P>
The ministers stressed that Britain would continue to argue its
corner -- there would be no empty chairs at EU meetings where
national interests were at stake.
</P>
<P>
The British government, which was greatly angered at the EU
Veterinary Committee's rejection of an EU proposal to lift the ban
on some British beef by-products, has threatened to disrupt normal
EU business unless rapid progress is made on lifting the ban on
British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed the worldwide ban on British beef product
exports on March 27 after the British government acknowledged that
there might be possible links between BSE or mad cow disease and
its human equivalent Creutzdelft-Jacob Disease.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Agrees to Talk With Chechen Rebel Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
has agreed to hold talks with the leader of the Chechen rebel
separatists, Zelimkan Yandarbiyev, the presidential press
service said today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement circulated here this evening, the press service
said, "Press Secretary of the Russian president Sergei Medvedev
declared that Boris Yeltsin confirms information of the OSCE
(Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe) group in
Chechnya regarding his readiness to begin talks with Zelimkhan
Yandarbiyev."
</P>
<P>
"President of the Russian Federation Boris Yeltsin gives
guarantees of safety to Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev himself and other
members of his delegation to the talks," Medvedev stated.
</P>
<P>
The presidential spokesman told reporters here earlier today
that Yeltsin "is to have talks begin as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
The OSCE secretariat in Vienna said in a statement that Yeltsin
and Yandarbiyev were due to meet in Moscow in the next few days to
discuss a set of military questions, according to reports reaching
here.
</P>
<P>
"The conflict in Chechnya must be settled," the OSCE
secretariat said. "A preliminary agreement has been reached
on the need for the resumption of dialogue between the warring
parties on the principles of the agreement on the peaceful
settlement in the Chechen Republic signed by the authorized
delegations from the warring parties on July 30, 1995."
</P>
<P>
Also today, Russian federal troops seized one of the last
strongholds of Chechen separatists -- the village of Bamut
located in the southwest of Chechnya -- after several days of
fierce fighting. Bamut was a former Soviet missile base.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua)-- U.S. President Bill Clinton and
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl met today in Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
to discuss an array of foreign policy issues.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the two leaders focused on the U.S.-led
peacekeeping mission in Bosnia and the upcoming Russian elections,
sources close to the meeting told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Clinton and Kohl also discussed the ways
to promote the peace process in the Middle East and fight
terrorism in the region.
</P>
<P>
Washington and Bonn have reportedly friction over relations
with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The United States believes that a tough line is the only way
to end what it says is Iran's backing to terrorism and sabotage
of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Germany, traditionally a big supplier of technology to Iran,
has insisted that its contacts with Tehran have helped reduce
human rights abuses and helped persuade Iran to sign the
International Chemical Weapons Convention.
</P>
<P>
The visit is Kohl's 23d one to the United States since he
became the German chancellor in 1982. He is scheduled to fly to
Washington after the visit to Milwaukee, a Midwest metropolis with
a large German-American population.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese President Reiterates Call for Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
reiterated here today his country's call for an implementation of
U.N. Security Council Resolution 425, saying that the resolution
is not a peace with Israel, but provides for an Israeli withdrawal
from our lands.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when meeting with Milham Karam, president
of the Lebanese Journalists Association.
</P>
<P>
On a proposed five-state committee which is to be set up to
monitor the cease-fire in south Lebanon, the Lebanese president
stressed his country's demand that the committee should be
distanced from political affairs.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the United States, France, Israel, Lebanon
and Syria have been meeting in Washington since May 10 to iron out
their differences on the formation of the committee, called for by
a cease-fire understanding reached between Lebanon and Israel on
April 26.
</P>
<P>
"We want the committee to be definitely military and to have
the right to act and execute (its decision), because its entry in
the politics will make us lose Resolution 425," Hrawi told Karam.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres will
win in the approaching general elections, which are due on May 29.
</P>
<P>
"If Peres really wants the peace and is sincere for his pursuit of
the peace, we will not be afraid of his success in the elections
as head of the government and owner of the majority," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi noted that he would not sign any peace treaty with Israel
by himself, but it should be signed by the people.
</P>
<P>
"I can not sign a treaty," he said, "I think that a
peace treaty is not signed between one head of state and
another but is signed by the people."
</P>
<P>
"What does it mean if I sign a treaty which is not satisfied by
the citizens?" he asked, without specifying whether he would seek
a referendum for any peace treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said Lebanon is pursuing the peace, but it would never
accept a peace which is at the cost of Lebanon's
sovereignty.

<HEADLINE> Rifkind: Non-Cooperation with EU May Last Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Malcolm
Rifkind has strongly indicated that the British government's
non-cooperation policy with the European Union (EU) could last
several months, while British envoys in Brussels started
disrupting normal EU business.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind was quoted by the BBC television as saying that the
British government's newly unveiled non-cooperation campaign with
the EU could last two or three months, or even longer if there was
no progress on lifting the global ban on British beef product
exports.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind made it clear that Britain had no desire for the policy
of disrupting EU business to last a day longer than necessary,
meaning Britain's non-cooperation policy would end as soon as the
EU lifted the ban on British beef product exports.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, British government sources stressed that the campaign
to bring the EU to a standstill would be lifted only when there
was agreement on a clear timetable for the complete ending of the
eight-week-old ban.
</P>
<P>
On the shocking reactions from across the EU countries, Rifkind
said some European reactions had been negative but others had been
encouraging, adding that "the policy is concentrating minds
wonderfully."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the British envoys in Brussels have started
implementing the British government's non-cooperation policy by
blocking some EU proposals.
</P>
<P>
Britain's deputy ambassador to the EU David Bostock told his EU
partners earlier today that Britain was blocking measures under
discussion because of the EU ban on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
"The British government is obliged to approach today's agenda
in the wider context of the crisis on BSE," Bostock said.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats in Brussels said that Britain was expected to
blocking more EU proposals in the coming days, according to a
separate report.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major announced Tuesday that
Britain would disrupt normal EU business in a bid to to get the EU
ban lifted, when the EU Veterinary Committee voted to reject an EU
proposal to lift the ban on some British beef by-product exports.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Recommends UNOMIL Mandate Renewal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 23 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali recommended today that the Security Council
extend the mandate of a 25-member U.N. observer group in Liberia
for three months.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Security Council, the secretary-general
recalled that in its resolution 1020, the council mandated the
U.N. Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) to assist in the
implementation of the Abuja Agreement, especially disarmament and
demobilization.
</P>
<P>
"However, in the present insecure and unstable conditions that
prevail in Monrovia and throughout Liberia, there is little that
the UNOMIL can accomplish with respect to these objectives," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, through the use of its good offices, the
UNOMIL continues to play an important role in supporting the
efforts of the ECOWAS (Economic Community of Western African
States) to facilitate the resumption of the peace process," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"It can also facilitate, in consultation with the ECOMOG
(ECOWAS Monitoring Group), the adoption of confidence-building
measures, with a view to creating conditions of the peace
process," he added.
</P>
<P>
In making the recommendation, the secretary-general strongly
urged the Liberian faction leaders to consider carefully the
wide-ranging consequences that their actions during the next two
months will have and, in this light, to implement immediately the
measures aimed at realizing political reconciliations.
</P>
<P>
There is a scheduled summit meeting of the ECOWAS in August
deciding whether to continue its peacekeeping efforts in Liberia
in view of facts the factions leaders are not willing to give up
violence.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said in the report that the withdrawal
of the ECOMOG from Liberia could be catastrophic not only for the
country but also for the subregion as a whole.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Hijackers to Be Tried </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The three people who commandeered an
EgyptAir passenger plane to Libya in March and the other person
involved in the hijacking will be tried by Egypt's Higher State
Security Court.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Mahmoud Hamid, 42, his 17-year-old son Khaled and
16-year-old nephew Ahmed Hussein Kamel Selim hijacked an Airbus
A320 on March 27 and surrendered to the Libyan authorities later
in the day. The plane was en route from the Saudi city of Jeddah
to Cairo with a stopover in Egypt's southern resort city of Luxor.
</P>
<P>
They are accused of hijacking the plane, endangering the lives
of the 145 people on board and illegal possession of explosives
with the intent to harm people. The were extradited to Egypt on
March 31.
</P>
<P>
The fourth defendant, Abdel Wahab Mokhtar Saeed Abdel Kerim,
61, is indicted on the last charge.
</P>
<P>
Kerim, a mechanic, who never boarded the plane, was accused of
helping the hijackers get a bag of gunpowder which they threatened
to ignite on board the plane.
</P>
<P>
Hamid, the owner of a cafe in Luxor, said that he had hijacked
the plane to demand the lifting of the Israeli closure of
Palestinian self-rule areas and express his objection to imposing
sanctions on Sudan for its failure to hand over the three suspects
involved in the assassination attempt on Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak last June, Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA)
reported today.

of the maneuvers which are being carried out at Koushk-Nossrat, 50
kilometers north of Qom.
</P>

The maneuvers are codenamed "Velayat" or Guardianship, after
Khamenei's title of the Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said that the Islamic Republic armed forces are no
threat to any country except those who plan to stage aggression
against it.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that several
thousands of tanks, artillery, Katyusha multiple-launcher rockets,

<HEADLINE> WHO Concerns About Growth in Global Tobacco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
today warned against the growing tobacco consumption globally,
saying unless the trend is reversed, people killed by tobacco will
hit 10 million annually in less than 30 years, up from some 3
million in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
About 70 percent of those deaths will occur in the developing
countries, where 50 percent of males on average smoke. In rich
nations, 62 million people, half of them middle-aged, will die
from smoking during the second half of this century.
</P>
<P>
WHO experts told a news conference that over the last decade,
tobacco consumption dropped in developed nations, but increased in
developing countries, particularly in China, which consumed 17
trillion cigarettes in 1993, or 31 percent of the global market.
</P>
<P>
The annual cigarette consumption per adult rose from 1,410 in
the early 1970s to 1,660 in the early 1990s globally. It grew from
860 to 1,410 in the less developed countries, from 730 to 1,900 in
China, and dropped from 2,910 to 2,570 in rich countries.
</P>
<P>
Notably, female smokers have been on the rise, especially in
rich nations, where only 2 percent of deaths among middle-aged
women was due to smoking in the 1950s, compared to 15 percent in
the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
WHO experts said that studies show the death rates among
smokers, if they smoke long enough, three times higher than among
non-smokers, and that at least half the smokers will be killed by
tobacco.
</P>
<P>
In addition, passive smoking has become a cause of increase in
deaths among non-smokers.
</P>
<P>
Globally, the tobacco-caused economic loss is estimated at 200
billion U.S. dollars annually, WHO experts quoted sources from the
World Bank as saying.
</P>
<P>
The world has now about 1.1 billion smokers, 300 million of
them in developed countries, 800 million in developing countries;
900 million of them males and 200 million females, consuming 15
cigarettes each day on average.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, they consumed over 52 trillion cigarettes. The three
countries of China, the United States and Japan alone accounted
for 47.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
WHO experts said among tobacco control strategies so far
adopted, including requirements for warning on cigarette packages
and ban on smoking in public sites, heavier taxation on tobacco
products has proved very effective, which however implies
potential for increased smuggling.
</P>
<P>
According to them, the current 49th session of the World Health
Assembly (WHA) in Geneva approved two resolutions on tobacco
control today, one of them a framework global convention.
</P>
<P>
They are on top of 14 resolutions adopted by the WHA from 1970
to 1995.

<HEADLINE> NATO Proposes Hotline between Ankara and Athens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana proposed to launch a hotline between Turkey and Greece,
the troubled NATO partners across the Aegean, for immediate
reaction to possible crisis.
</P>
<P>
The local Anatolia news agency quoted Turkish officials as
saying that the hotline was one of the three proposals from the
NATO chief during his 24-hour visit to Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Such a hotline could provide immediate communication in case
of a crisis such as the military stand-off in the Aegean in
January as a result of Turkish-Greek dispute over the twin-islets
of Kardak, or Imia.
</P>
<P>
Turkish diplomats consider this measure an easy one that could
be implemented quickly.
</P>
<P>
The second proposal is that NATO place AWACS (Airborne Warning
and Control System) during maneuvers in the Aegean in order to
prevent highly charged and sometimes false accusations of air
violations.
</P>
<P>
The third one is to extend confidence-building-measures Turkey
and Greece agreed on in 1988. The measures include no military
exercises should be launched during national holidays of each
country.
</P>
<P>
"I am basically optimistic. We are discussing ways to improve
relations between Turkey and Greece." Solana told a press
conference before he left Ankara following a 24-hour visit.
</P>
<P>
He held talks with Turkey's foreign and defense Ministers and
was received by Turkish President Suleyman Demirel and Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief also stressed the strategic importance of Turkey
in the alliance, as well as the role Turkey played in European
security and the Bosnia issue.
</P>
<P>
But Solana gave no clear reply at the press conference to
whether Greece and Turkey showed political will to carry out the
measures he had proposed.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Deputy Premier on Oil-for-Food Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz has stressed that the signing of the memorandum of
understanding between Iraq and the United Nations on Monday is
only a "rudimentary and limited step" toward a complete lifting of
U.N. trade sanctions imposed on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking to reporters here Wednesday after attending a
symposium on sanctions sponsored by the Non-Aligned Student Youth
Organization.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that the U.N. should not postpone and stop discussing
issues relating to the lifting of sanctions against Iraq on the
excuse that Iraq will secure food and medicine under the agreement
on an oil-for-food deal reached between Iraq and the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
He called upon the world community to exert efforts to halt the
practice of imposing sanctions which is contradictory to the
U.N. charter, the international law and basic humanitarian
principles.
</P>
<P>
Aziz accused the United States of pursuing hegemony which has
posed threat to the people of the world and caused death of tens
of thousands of Iraqis, in particular children, women and the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the world organizations, including the Arab
League and the Organization of African Unity, should take firm
stand in rejecting the imposition of economic sanctions against
any country.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraq will develop its economy crippled by U.N.
sanctions on the basis of self-reliance, adding that Iraq's
foreign policy will remain unchanged.

<HEADLINE> (rpt with correction) Gasoline Prices Steady, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Gasoline prices in the U.S.,
which had been soaring during the past months, are stabilizing and
the prospect for lower prices is improving.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent survey conducted by the U.S. Energy
Department, the average price of the regular gasoline was 1.28
U.S. dollars a gallon this week, slightly lower than the peak
price of nearly 1.29 dollars last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The decline resulted from an increase of oil supply in the
country. According to the newest figure released by the American
Petroleum Institute this week, gasoline supplies rose by 1.85
million barrels, or about 1 percent, to 204.9 million barrels for
the week ending May 17.
</P>
<P>
Gasoline prices in the U.S. rose by an average of 20 cents a
gallon from early February to the middle of May.
</P>
<P>
The average price of all kinds of gasoline surged to 1.36
dollars a gallon at the end of April and President Bill Clinton
ordered the sale of 12 million barrels of oil from the nation's
strategic petroleum reserve to drive down the prices.
</P>
<P>
The factors behind the soaring prices are yet to be found out.
But analysts said that one of the reasons was the sharp squeeze at
refineries that were unable to switch as much output to gasoline
because they were forced by the cold winter to produce heating oil
longer than normal.
</P>
<P>
Even as the gasoline prices are declining, the Republicans in
Congress are still taking advantage of the price-up to try to
repeal the 4.3 cent-a-gasoline tax increase which was imposed by
the government in 1993 but strongly opposed by the Republicans.

</P>
<P>
The new PRC members include the new service chief of the army

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

reshuffle.
</P>

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton and
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl today pledged to further strengthen
the partnership between the two countries and peoples.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a 90-minute meeting in the U.S.

common positions on an array of foreign affairs issues, including
the NATO expansion, the forthcoming Russian presidential elections
and implementation of the Bosnian peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Germany today signed two agreements on
air safety and skies opening.
</P>
<P>
"Today, the partnership between our two nations has taken
another important step forward," Clinton said at a joint press

will strengthen our cooperation in this vital economic sector. The
safety agreement will help us to clear the way to better, safe air
traffic."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and German leaders said that they agreed to strengthen
the role of the western military alliance in the post-Cold War
changed world.
</P>
<P>
"We think NATO does have a role to play in order to secure
freedom for the peoples of the world," Kohl said. "And I think
that we should do everything, we should use prudence and
far-sightedness and wisdom, and to bear in mind also the changes
in the world today, and that we should pursue a course that bears
these changes in mind."
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Nepali Ruling Partner Denies Lust for Portfolios </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 24 (Xinhua) -- President of Nepal's second
ruling partner, the National Democratic Party (RPP), Surya N Bahad
Bahadur Thapa today strongly denied charges of his party's craving
for cabinet posts reportedly made by the main ruling Nepali
Congress (NC) party.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers reported that NC President Girija Prasad
Koirala Thursday openly accused the RPP of leading to another
cabinet expansion.
</P>
<P>
Thapa said in a statement issued today that he did not believe
Kiorala would have made such remarks against his party.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba last week added four members
to his cabinet, making it a 48-strong one and the biggest ever in
the country's history.
</P>
<P>
The three-party coalition, set up last September, has by now
expanded its cabinet, or the Council of Ministers, for three
times.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Koirala as saying that the RPP's lust for
ministerial posts was growing and thus posing great difficulties
for the main ruling NC party.
</P>
<P>
Thapa said in his statement that it would be "unfortunate" if
Koirala had really made the reported remarks.
</P>
<P>
"If political problems could be solved by passing out remarks
against other parties, I reserve my rights to comment on the
character of the NC party," he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that such conducts would push the present political
situation towards further complications.
</P>
<P>
The RPP party, occupying 19 out of the 205 seats in the lower
house, holds 15 seats in the Nepali cabinet.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Researcher Finds Immune System's "Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian researcher has identified
a protein that "flips the switch" to shut down the T-cells, the
white blood cells that kill invaders.
</P>
<P>
The finding of the protein, known as SYP, has opened the
possibility of developing drugs to help boost defenses against
cancers or AIDS, or to control autoimmune diseases such as lupus
or diabetes, according to today's Globe and Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
SYP is a type of the protein tyrosine phosphatase, and is
produced within the cell on orders from a molecule on the cell
surface.
</P>
<P>
"The switch molecule, CTLA-4. acts as the general, ordering the
proteins, which are like privates, to do the physical work of
halting activity in the cell when the immune defense is complete,"
the paper quoted the researcher, Dr. Luc Marengere of the Ontario
Cancer Institute, as saying.
</P>
<P>
A breakdown in the chain of command allows the immune cells to
remain potent attackers and begin to attack friendly cells. Attack
by uncontrolled T-cells is believed to be behind many autoimmune
diseases such as lupus, diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, Dr.
Marengere said.
</P>
<P>
SYP is the first of the proteins to be identified and there may
be others with specific effects that moderate immune responses and
shut the cell off, he said.
</P>
<P>
A different kind of proteins acting on another receptor gives
the order to turn on, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Now, we can develop therapeutics that make use of this to
manipulate the immune system," either encouraging the chain of
command or breaking it down, he said. However, the treatments on
humans are likely to be several years away, he added.

came further close to its goal of winning the trophy for a
straight second time as it defeated South Korea 3-2 to qualify for
the final of the 19th Thomas Cup world men's badminton team
championships here today.
</P>
<P>
And Denmark achieved a historical victory as they defeated
world badminton power China 3-2 to qualify for the final for the
first time since 1979.
</P>
<P>
The Danes had never won over the Chinese in the five previous

<P>
But the Dane turned around the tide as he came from a 12-point
deficit to beat Dong 18-17 in the second. The Dane went on to win
the third game 15-11.

<HEADLINE> US Orders of Durable Goods Down in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Orders of durable goods in the
U.S. fell by 1.9 percent in April, the third drop in four months,
the U.S. Commerce Department reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that orders totaled a seasonally adjusted
166 billion dollars, down from 169.3 billion in March.
</P>
<P>
The decline resulted from a decrease of aircraft orders which
offset an increase in cars and trucks. Transportation orders
plunged 12.6 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
But when the transportation component was excluded, orders rose
1.7 percent, the fourth increase in five months and the largest
since a 2.1 percent jump last October.
</P>
<P>
The department noted that for the year to date, orders were 3.6
percent above the first four months in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Factory orders are considered a key gauge of the nation's
manufacturing sector and an increase could lead to greater
production and more jobs.
</P>
<P>
Industrial production in the U.S. rebounded in April from an
automobile-strike related downturn in March. And the nation's
purchasing managers said in a recent survey that manufacturing
strengthened in April for the first time in nine months, although
at an extremely slow pace.

<HEADLINE> Teen Smoking Rate Rises in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- A federal study shows more
teenagers in the United States smoke today than at any time since
the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 35 percent of students in grades nine through 12 said
they smoked last year, according to the survey released Thursday
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That percentage
is up from just over 30 percent in 1993 and 27.5 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, the percentage of smokers among adults was 25
percent, and the figure has been dropping since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
White girls are most likely to smoke, at 40 percent; followed
by white boys, at 37 percent; Hispanic boys, 35 percent; and
Hispanic girls, 33 percent; black boys, 28 percent, and black
girls, 12 percent, the study found.
</P>
<P>
The study, which surveyed nearly 11,000 teens under age 18,
raised questions about retailers' commitment to observing bans on
cigarette sales to minors.
</P>
<P>
Most of the teenagers said they were not asked to show proof of
age when buying cigarettes; only 2 percent said they bought
cigarettes from vending machines and 39 percent said they usually
bought cigarettes in a store.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton called the report "disturbing proof that
more and more young teenagers are becoming lifelong smokers," and
said too little is being done to prevent them from purchasing
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
At least 3 million teenagers are smokers. Studies show 82
percent of adults smoked their first cigarette by age 18, the CDC
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Agricultural scientists have been
urged to speed up trials of chemical control in a bid to check the
spread of the noxious aquatic weed, the water hyacinth before it
goes out of control, reported Radio Uganda today.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries John
Nasassire made the call in a speech here on thursday when
checking on the progress of the experiments of chemical control
of the water weed by spraying chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Nasassire said his ministry is now on the move to use all
possible measures and methods to bring the water hyacinth under
control.
</P>
<P>
Government will invite other scientists with more experience
in the control of this noxious weed, to work alongside local
scientists for an effective control of it, he added.
</P>
<P>
Nasassire assured Ugandans that chemicals to be used in the
control of the weed will be thoroughly tested to ensure that they
are environmentally friendly and safe to human and all aquatic
animals.
</P>
<P>
The weed has since 1992 strangled 90 percent of the shoreline
of rivers and lakes, a stretch of about 2,000 kilometers. The
weed is covering all bays of Lake Victoria, Lake Kyoga, River
Nile in Uganda and, to a small extent, Lake Albert.

<HEADLINE> Major Flies to Bosnia to Inspect British Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major is
expected to hold talks with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic
during his one-day visit to British troops in Bosnia, Downing
Street officials said.
</P>
<P>
This is Major's first visit to the 11,500 British peacekeepers,
currently part of the NATO-led Peace Implementation Force (IFOR),
since 1994 and will focus on the need for more international aid
for Bosnia, officials said.
</P>
<P>
In another development, British Defence Secretary Michael
Portillo was reported as reaffirming Britain's stand that it will
pull its troops out of Bosnia along with U.S. troops at the end of
the year when the 12-month IFOR mission to restore peace to Bosnia
expires.
</P>
<P>
But the British Independent newspaper reported Thursday that a
significant peace-keeping force, made up of American, British and
French troops, is to stay in Bosnia after the NATO-led IFOR troops
withdraw from Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The United States has insisted that American IFOR troops would
leave Bosnia after the year-long peace mission, but it appears
that the Americans would put off the withdrawal and are more
likely to accept a plan of a residual force.

<HEADLINE> No Need for Trade War With S.Africa, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- While there are significant
trade imbalances between South Africa and Botswana, there is no
need for a trade war between the two countries, Botswana's
President Ketumile Masire said today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference during the southern African economic summit
in Cape Town, Masire said: "We certainly are more disadvantaged than
most countries in our trade with South Africa, but I don't think we
should war over it."
</P>
<P>
The summit, which was jointly organized by the World Economic
Forum of Geneva and the Southern African Development Community
(SADC), was being attended by SADC political leaders and about
400 senior businessmen around the world.
</P>
<P>
Masire's remarks followed a Zimbabwe News Agency report that a
trade war was looming between Zimbabwe and South Africa, after
President Robert Mugabe announced on Thursday that his government
would soon formulate policies to protect its industries.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, who arrived in Cape Town on Wednesday for the summit,
called on South Africa to cooperate with other countries in
southern Africa to achieve sustained economic growth in the
sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is currently trying to renegotiate a suitable trade
agreement with South Africa following the expiry in December 1992
of the 1964 bilateral pact.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- France today condemned the killings
of seven French monks kidnapped two months ago in Algeria by the
extremist Armed Islamic Group (GIA).
</P>
<P>
French newspaper La Croix today quoted French Foreign Minister
Herve de Charette as saying the monks' killers bore a great
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
French Defense Minister Charles Millon condemned the killings
as an intolerable act of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The GIA, a radical offshoot of outlawed Islamic Salvation
Front, said in a message broadcast by a Moroccan radio on Thursday
that they killed the seven monks on Tuesday due to the French
government's refusal to negotiate over the release of the GIA
members, held in France.
</P>
<P>
Although the French government has repeatedly urged all its
citizens to leave Algeria over the last three years, many French
people, including clergy, are still living there.

<HEADLINE> HK, US Business Schools To Exchange Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- An agreement was signed here
today on a student exchange program between the youngest and the
oldest business schools in the world.
</P>
<P>
The School of Business and Management of the Hong Kong
University of Science and Technology (HKUST), founded in 1991,
hopes to broaden students' horizon through academic exchanges with
 the 115-year-old Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
Wharton is currently ranked as the top business school in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, each year three undergraduate students
will be chosen from each business school to study at the other
school for one semester.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony, Professor Yuk-Shee Chan, dean of the
Hong Kong business school, said: "One of the key objectives of our
 business program is to develop an international perspective for
our students,"
</P>
<P>
Thomas P. Gerrity, dean of the Wharton School, said: "The
United States took a lead in the era of the past, and now comes
the era of Asia. The exchange program will facilitate
opportunities for the American students to learn about the fastest
 growing economies in the world."
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong is a meeting point, or rather a melting point
 of the east and the west, and students here are likely to have a
global perspective. The HKUST, though one of the youngest
universities in the world, is innovative and developing very
quickly, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dr Y. Joseph Lian, associate dean of the HKUST's business
school, said, "Actually, we have carried out student exchange
programs with a dozen of overseas universities in Asia, North
America and Europe."
</P>
<P>
More than 50 undergraduate students have been selected to go
for one-semester overseas studies. The agreement just signed with
Wharton marks an important step in the development of the program,
 he added.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that Wharton School has joined hands with
Shanghai Jiaotong University to initiate an executive program in
China. It has cooperated with Qinghua University -- one of the
prestigious universities in China -- on a faculty exchange
program.

<HEADLINE> Britain Determined to Get Beef Ban Lifted: Rifkind </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Malcolm
Rifkind repeated the government's determination to stick to a
non-cooperation campaign with the European Union (EU) unless
it relaxes the world-wide ban on British beef products.
</P>
<P>
In an article in today's German newspaper General-Anzeiger,
Rifkind said the EU should not expect Britain to cooperation if
the organization doesn't adopt dialogue and negotiation with
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind said Britain will let the "mad cow" problem dwarf other
topics at the EU summit meeting in Florence, Italy, in June, if
the issue isn't resolved.
</P>
<P>
But he also noted that Britain will make efforts to reach
consensus with the EU on overcoming the "mad cow" crisis and
relaxing the ban in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
"Good will" and "recognition of each member state's interests"
can help the EU operate, Rifkind said.
</P>
<P>
He made clear that Britain's determination to solving the "mad
cow" crisis should not be doubted and his country will join hands
with its partners to end the crisis "seriously and patiently."
</P>
<P>
The EU's standing veterinary committee on Monday rejected a
plan to relax the seven-week-old world-wide ban on British beef
exports imposed after the British government admitted a possible
link between so-called "mad cow" disease which affects cattle, and
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a degenerative brain disorder found in
humans.
</P>
<P>
Seven of the 15 EU member states -- Spain, Germany, Austria,
Portugal, Greece, Belgium and the Netherlands -- voted against the
European Commission's proposal to lift the ban on the British beef
by-products of tallow, gelatine and bull semen.
</P>
<P>
Following the humiliating setback, British Prime Minister John
Major triggered Britain's biggest confrontation with Europe
Tuesday when he declared that he was blocking all important
progress in the EU until further notice.
</P>
<P>
The campaign of obstruction to paralyze EU business could run
for months.
</P>
<P>
Major and his "war cabinet," as the British press dubbed it,
met Thursday to prepare for battle over the beef ban while British
representatives on the same day cast their first veto at a EU
ministerial meeting in Brussels.

<HEADLINE> Hainan, Taiwan to Enhance Agricultural Co-operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Hainan Province, the biggest special
economic zone, will boost agricultural co-operation with Taiwan
Province, provincial officials said today.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has decided to make Hainan as an experimental
area for promoting agricultural co-operation between the two sides
of the Taiwan Straits, said Li Yongchun, director of Hainan's
Taiwan Affairs Office.
</P>
<P>
"We will relax control over investment from Taiwan and import
and export management, and carry out more favorable policies on
land use and taxation," Li said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the provincial government will take measures to
facilitate the approval of large-scale agricultural projects by
businessmen from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The co-operation will be focused on promoting agricultural
research, cultivating fine strains and developing a better
marketing system for agricultural means of production and rural
products, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Deputy Governor Mao Zhijun, the province has
abundant tropical agricultural resources and marine resources,
such as vegetables, fruits, cash crops and aquatic products, all
of which have considerable market potential.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Taiwan business people have large amounts of
funds and advanced agricultural technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that there are 1,210 Taiwan-funded enterprises
in the province, nearly 200 of which are agricultural projects.
</P>
<P>
The profitability of these enterprises has boosted the
confidence of Taiwan investors, Mao said.

<HEADLINE> Indian Government Vows to Speed up Economic Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 24 (Xinhua) -- India's new government today
pledged to accelerate the previous administration's economic
reforms, which it acknowledged as a success in the last five
years, and said it will strive to double the amount of foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government made the pledge
while outlining its economic agenda in President Shankar Dayal
Sharma's address to the joint session of parliament today.
</P>
<P>
According to the president's address to parliament, the BJP
pledged to speed up the economic reforms, launched by the Rao
government five years ago, by maintaining a "sound" framework of
fiscal and monetary policies in a bid to double the in-flow of
foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Sharma said in his address that the BJP government is resolved
to curb inflation, remove obsolete rules and regulations and carve
out a new role for itself to support a framework of pro-growth
free market operations.
</P>
<P>
The government will also prune non-development expenditure,
accelerate tax reforms to reduce fiscal deficits and review and
simplify the regime of foreign exchange controls in line with the
needs of the modernizing economy, Sharma said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would maintain reasonable taxation
levels to ensure an equitable distribution of the burden among all
sections of the society.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Sharma also talked about India's nuclear policy
and relations with neighboring Pakistan.
</P>

<HEADLINE> UN Vehicles Looted in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Almost all the vehicles belonging to
the United Nations observers mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) were
looted at the height of the renewed fighting which broke out on
April 6, the UN said today.
</P>
<P>
In a report submitted to the UN Security Council, the copy of
which was obtained here by Xinhua today, UN Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali said that telephones, photocopiers,
computers and other communication equipment were also looted by
Liberia's factional fighters.
</P>
<P>
"UNOMIL and all the UN agencies in Liberia have been
systematically looted by fighters from all the factions since
April 6," said Ghali.
</P>
<P>
"The fighter cleaned out all UN offices, damaged the buildings
and looted the UN warehouses," he added.
</P>
<P>
UNOMIL was deployed to Liberia last year to assist the
sub-regional peacekeeping forces, the ECOMOG, in the
implementation of the Abuja peace accord signed by the warring
factions in the Nigerian capital.
</P>
<P>
Only five of the mission's 93 military observers remain in the
west African country since most of them were evacuated to
Freetown and Dakar during the latest round of fighting.
</P>
<P>
Despite the looting as well as the threat to the lives of the
UN observers, the UN boss has recommended that the mission's
mandate be extended for three months, until August 31.
</P>
<P>
In making the recommendation to the Security Council, the UN
chief said that though there was little that UNOMIL could do
under the unstable situation in Liberia, it could still use its
good offices to facilitate effort to restore the peace process.
</P>
<P>
On the renewed fighting which is jeopardizing the Abuja peace
accord, Ghali accused the faction leaders of disregarding the
will of their people for peace.
</P>
<P>
The civil war, which started in December 1989, has been
dragged on for over six years, during which 150,000 lives have
been claimed and over half of the country's 2.6 million
population have been displaced.
</P>
<P>
Under the Abuja peace accord, the west African state is
scheduled to hold its post-war general elections in August this
year. But owing to the re-eruption of fighting, this peace
peospect is widely doubted by the general public.

areas and increase their understanding of the overall situation in
the inland areas and contribute to the smooth transition and
stability and prosperity of Hong Kong.

<P>
After Hong Kong's return to the motherland, Li said, its
economic order, legal system and life style will remain virtually
unchanged under the principle of "one country, two systems".

"The central government will not send a single official to the
SAR," he said, adding that this will be beneficial to both Hong
Kong's long-term stability and prosperity and China's reform,
opening-up and modernization construction.

the political bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central
Committee and the member of the secretariat of the CPC Central

<P>
HONG KONG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Danish badminton players achieved
a historic victory as they defeated world badminton powerhouse
China to qualify for the final of the 19th Thomas Cup world men's
badminton team championships here today.
</P>
<P>
The Danes, who had never won over the Chinese in the five
previous encounters in the history of the event, defeated China
3-2 in the semi-finals today.
</P>
<P>
Denmark brought about an up-set win in the opening singles,
through the strength of Poul Erik Hoyer-Larsen, semi-finalist at
last year's world championships in Jakarta and now ranked third in
 the world.
</P>
<P>
Hoyer-Larsen lost the opening set 15-6 to China's Dong Jiong,
now ranked second in the world.
</P>
<P>
But the Dane turned the tide as he beat a 11-point deficit at
13-2 behind the Chinese in the second set and won 18-17. The Dane
 went on to win the third game 15-11.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese players won the two following matches and the Danes
took the fourth, and the two sides tied at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
It was 16th-ranked Peter Rasmusen who sealed up a Danish
victory as he took two games to none for China's Lin Liwen.
</P>
<P>
Defending champions Indonesia meet South Korea in the other
semi-final this evening and the winners will clash with Denmark
for the coveted trophy.
</P>
<P>
Li Yongbo, China's head coach, said: "We had the perfect chance
to win 3-0 over Denmark. But we lost because Dong Jiong failed
to hold on in the first singles."
</P>
<P>
"We lost the tie against a side we had predicted to win and we
had to pay for the loss, dearly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Morten Frost, the Danish coach and a former world-class player,
said: "We were lucky to win over China today. I thought Poul Erik
(Hoyer-Larsen) could win at first game. But Dong just played well
and Poul didn't."
</P>
<P>
"But he (Poul Eri) suddenly got himself together and began to
win," he recalled. "But I had the strong belief that if we could
win the first singles, we had the chance to win 3-2," he added.

<HEADLINE> Racism Still Haunts Zimbabwe, Says News Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Despite the policy of
reconciliation between blacks and whites in Zimbabwe, racism
still haunts the nation, according to the Zimbabwean National
News Agency ZIANA.
</P>
<P>
Hardly a month passes without either side raising racist
sentiments that threaten to harden attitudes between the
communities, said ZIANA.
</P>
<P>
At issue is that blacks, who constitute 94 percent of the 10.5
million population, control less than three percent of the
economy and only 10 percent of productive land.
</P>
<P>
Whites, who number about 100,000, have a tight grip on the
economy with about 4,500 white commercial farmers owning about 70
percent of Zimbabwe's arable land.
</P>
<P>
At a recent press conference, President Robert Mugabe said,
"racism has not come from blacks. It is a vestige of colonialism
and has remained as a vestige in place. Here they want continue the
system of all-white management, all-white control and all-white
ownership."

Gaddafi, accompanied by a number of ministers, was greeted by
Egyptian Information Minister Safwat el-Sherif, Egypt's Middle

Gaddafi was scheduled to arrive in Marsa Matruh, an Egyptian

</P>
<P>
He will put up for the night in the city and leave Saturday
morning for Cairo, accompanied by Egyptian Information Minister

<P>
Gaddafi last visited Egypt in January, when he held talks with
Mubarak at a military base at Sidi Barrani, some 80 kilometers

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Cuts Down on Interest Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's central bank has taken deep
cuts on interest rates this year to keep up with the cash needs
being pumped up by the rapidly developing economy.
</P>
<P>
The loosened monetary control, effective since the beginning of
the year, is a "pragmatic move," explained Le Van Chau, deputy
governor of the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV).
</P>
<P>
The new policy is designed to encourage banking activities and
make them more efficient, the senior official was quoted as saying
by a report in the local press today.
</P>
<P>
The primary rate has reduced to 1.65 percent per month, or 0.1
percentage points below the SBV-imposed ceiling, from the 2.1
percent prevalent before the policy was in place.
</P>
<P>
The lower rate helped increase lending to a total of 8,000
billion Vietnamese Dongs (about 720 million U.S. dollars) in the
first four months of the year.
</P>
<P>
Along with measures to check against inflation, Chau said, the
rate reduction has promoted the macro-economic environment and
stabilized the Vietnamese currency.
</P>
<P>
Despite the lowered rates, he added, commercial banks in the
first four-month period of the year increased their balance by
6,000 billion Dongs (545 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Of the total, saving deposits went up by 4,600 billion Dongs
(418 million dollars). The fact showed that the new interest
rates have been accepted by the public, Chau said.
</P>
<P>
The rate of inflation in the January-April period was the
lowest in the last 10 years while consumer goods' price index
hiked by only 4.3 percent, he noted.

PHNOM PENH, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian farmers have signed
an international marketing deal with the Thai Castor Oil
Industrial Company to find overseas markets for Cambodian castor
oil, local newspapers said today.

Farmers in the association have planted more than a thousand
hectares of castor oil plants in Takeo and Kampot provinces to the
south of Phnom Penh, and will soon expand southwest of Phnom Penh
into Koh Kong and Kompong Speu provinces.

<P>
The Thai company will provide support to local farmers,

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Meets Preparatory Committee Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
here today that he hopes members of the Preparatory Committee of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will make a concerted
effort to prepare for the SAR.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with the Preparatory Committee's mainland and Hong
Kong members here for the Third Plenary Session, he said the
Chinese government has already formulated the major policies for
resuming the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to achieve a smooth transition," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came immediately after the conclusion of Jiang's
African visit. He told the committee's members, "this shows the
importance that the Party's Central Committee and the State
Council attach to the Preparatory Committee's work."
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the Preparatory Committee has done a lot of work
since it was established. It has proposed an explanation of the
Nationality Law for the Hong Kong SAR that was adopted by the
National People's Congress Standing Committee and satisfied
various social groups in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The committee's decision to establish the Provisional
Legislative Council is also a significant one for the preparation
of the Hong Kong SAR and a smooth transition, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the method of seeking advice used by the
Preparatory Committee's Selection Committee Panel last April fully
reflected the confidence of the people of Hong Kong in Hong Kong's
future.
</P>
<P>
Extending congratulations to the Preparatory Committee for its
work, Jiang said he believes the committee's future work will be
even better.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong to the motherland is only a year and a
month away, he said, adding that the present situation in Hong
Kong is quite good and its economic and social development is
going well.
</P>
<P>
"China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong
Kong and maintaining its long-term prosperity and stability are
the common aspiration of all Chinese people," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
"During the final stage of Hong Kong's transitional period, the
Chinese and British sides should co-operate well," he said,
pointing out that both sides must be aware that a smooth
transition is in the interest of the Hong Kong compatriots as well
as the Chinese and British themselves.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping's concept of "one country, two systems" is a very
important policy for settling the Hong Kong issue, he said, adding
that
 the key points now are that the British should look to to the
future, recognize the reality and realize the importance of the
smooth transition of Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Water Well in the "Sea of Death" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Clear water has appeared from a well
dug in the Taklimakan Desert, known as the "Sea of Death", in
northwest China, a Chinese geologist announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The 500-meter deep well is located in the heart of the Tarim
Oilfield in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The well is expected to provide clear water for 30,000 oil
workers. The water has only two grams of minerals per liter, which
is up to the state's standards for drinking water, said a Chinese
expert.
</P>
<P>
This is the first low-mineral-content water well in the desert,
giving the lie to the belief that there is no fresh water in the
region.
</P>
<P>
the Taklimakan is the second largest moving desert in the
world, covering an area of 337,000 sq. km. It has been described
by explorers as the "Sea of death" or "Forbidden area for lives",
after having swallowed six ancient kingdoms. Crossing the desert
has become easier now that a 523-km-long highway running through
it was opened to traffic last September.

<HEADLINE> Iran Stages Grand Military Maneuvers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran today launched the second
stage of the grand military maneuvers with fighter planes,
helicopters and the heavy artillery units opening fire at the
hypothetical enemy positions.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the tank units
and armored vehicles moved from all axes to take over the targets
as it had been planned immediately after the heavy fire by the
air forces and artillery units.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Iran's Supreme Leader and
Commander-in-Chief Ayatollah Ali Khamenei observed the operations
at Koushk-e Nosrat region, outside the religious city of Qom,
about 120 kilometers south of Tehran.

The two-day maneuvers of the army started Thursday which are
involved with 200,000 armed forces. The first stage of the war
games ended by an overnight assault into the enemy positions.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said Thursday that the Islamic Republic armed forces
are no threat to any country except those who plan to stage
aggression against it.
</P>
<P>
The official report said that several thousands of tanks,
artillery, Katyusha multiple-launcher rockets, personnel carriers
and various kinds of heavy and light weapons are used in the

<HEADLINE> Singaporeans Urged to Read More as Largest Book Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 24 (Xinhua) -- World Book Fair 1996, the largest
in Singapore and the region, opened here today with Deputy Prime
Minister Lee Hsien Loong urging Singaporeans to read more to make
Singapore a more cultured and gracious society.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Singapore's literacy rate has reached 90 percent
among those aged ten and above, Lee said at the opening ceremony
that as Singapore evolves into a modern, technologically-advanced
country, "we should aim beyond merely achieving high literacy
rates."
</P>
<P>
"We must also grow into a more cultured and gracious society.
Singaporeans must not neglect the habit of reading and become a
nation glued only to their TV or computer screens," the deputy
prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Citing a 1993 survey conducted by the National Library of
Singapore, Lee revealed that Singaporeans read 8.3 books a year,
lower than the figure of Japan, where the average person reads
more than twice as much, or 18 books a year, and that of the
United States, where an average person reads 25 books a year,
three times that of a Singaporean.
</P>
<P>
"Becoming a developed country means balancing economic growth
with cultural and social achievements. Singapore has some distance
to catch up," Lee stressed.
</P>
<P>
The World Book Fair, which makes its debut this year,
incorporates the World Chinese Book Fair which has been held since
1985.
</P>
<P>
Seow Choke Meng, chairman of the organizing committee of the
book fair, said, "after ten successful years, the Organizing
Committee has decided to repackage and expand the World Chinese
Book Fair to add on two new events, namely, the World English Book
Fair and the World Electronic Book Fair."
</P>
<P>
The World Book Fair 1996 draws 125 exhibitors from China,
Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, India, Australia, New Zealand,
Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"It is the largest book fair in Singapore and the region with a
total area of 15,000 square meters of exhibition space. We are
expecting 700,000 visitors for World Book Fair '96," Seow said.

<HEADLINE> Japan Maintains Position as Richest Nation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Japan maintained its position as the
world's "richest nation" for the fifth consecutive year in 1995, a
government report showed Friday.
</P>
<P>
As of the end of last year, the balance of the nation's net
overseas assets -- those held by the Japanese government and
businesses abroad minus their liabilities -- stood at a record
76,991 billion yen, up 15.2 percent from a year earlier, Finance
Minister Wataru Kubo said in a report to the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The latest figure marks the first year-on-year rise in two
years on a yen basis and the 14th straight increase in dollar
terms, according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The yen-denominated asset growth is accounted for in large part
by a solid rise in stock and bond investments and ever increasing
shifts of production bases abroad by businesses, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Japan far surpassed Germany, the world's
second-largest creditor nation, in its balance of net overseas
assets.
</P>
<P>
Britain was the only other creditor nation among the remaining
Group of Seven (G-7) countries, while Canada, France, Italy and
the United States all showed net deficits, the report
said.

Percy Barnevik, president of Sweden's Asea Brown Boveri Ltd.(ABB)
this morning at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse.
</P>
<P>
Zou invited Barnevik, who is here for a 2-day seminar on power
development in the 21st century that started on Thursday, to
further discuss power development in China and to explore
cooperation prospects between his company and China.
</P>
<P>

energy industry has become a major area of development with strong
demand.
</P>
<P>
Speeding up power development has become a key aspect in the
country's economic growth, he noted, adding that China wishes to
cooperate with other countries in building more hydro-electric
power and thermo-power stations.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier pointed out that there are many ways in which
China can cooperate with ABB, and that co-operation between China
and Sweden in hydro-electric power is quite promising.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes that China will increase co-operation with ABB
in personnel training.
</P>
<P>
Barnevik said that ABB wants to bring advanced technology to
China and find partners here to work together on power facilities.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed technical problems related to the
construction of power facilities.

<HEADLINE> Fujian-Taiwan Trade to Grow Faster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Trade and economic cooperation
between Fujian Province and Taiwan will certainly grow faster in
the future, according to Vice-Governor of Fujian Zhang Jiakun.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting on Taiwan investment Thursday, Zhang said,
"The economies of Fujian and Taiwan supply each other's needs and
enjoy great potential for further cooperation."
</P>
<P>
He said that economic relations between the two areas have been
becoming increasingly closer over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Fujian, which is separated by a strip of water from Taiwan, has
so far approved 4,305 Taiwan-funded companies involving 7.23
billion US dollars in Taiwan investment.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that Fujian approved 135 Taiwan-funded enterprises
in the first four months of this year, involving 420 million US
dollars in Taiwan investment, up over ten percent from the same
period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Taiwan companies have become involved in the
development of Fujian's farming sector, processing industry, the
service sector and infrastructure."
</P>
<P>
He praised Taiwan-funded companies as a "driving force" behind
an export-oriented economy in Fujian.
</P>
<P>
He said that the provincial government will continue to
encourage Taiwan companies to invest in Fujian.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Taiwan companies are being encouraged to invest
in the farming sector, basic industries, pillar industries and
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
He promised to improve Fujian's investment environment by
formulating more regulations and rules governing trade and
economic cooperation with Taiwan companies.

<HEADLINE> Cultural Relics Well Protected in Xi'an  (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
However, Zhang Fuchun, deputy mayor in charge of urban
development and cultural relics protection, conceded that it is
impossible for the relics, which occupy vast areas, never to stand
in the way of economic development, especially at a time of reform
and opening up.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, the ancient ruins of palaces of four
dynasties, the Zhou (1100 B.C.-771 B.C.), Qin (221-206 B.C.), Han
and Tang alone take up a total of 108 sq km in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
In order to coordinate economic growth with relics protection,
he said, the city has persuaded farmers living in the reserved
areas not to dig deep in the fields.
</P>
<P>
"For their economic interests, we encouraged them to engage in
businesses like breeding, dairy production, fruit tree planting,
gardening and transportation," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The government also built parks, museums and miniature
sceneries around these ruins to attract tourists, which not only
protected the relics, but also brought money for the farmers.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the city has always attached great
importance to international co-operation in its protection of
cultural relics for the sake of funds and advanced technology.
</P>
<P>
"In 1994 we received a donation of over one million US dollars
from the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural
Organization and the Japanese government," he recalled.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, he said, Chinese and Japanese experts have made
joint efforts to restore the ruins of two major palaces of the
Tang Dynasty. They are also working on a large park around the
ruins of the Qinglong (dark dragon) Temple, one of the three most
influential temples of Chan (Zen) Buddhism during the Tang Dynasty
and the origin of Japan's Zen Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
Both Chinese and foreign archeologists are deeply impressed by
the city's success in protecting cultural relics, which after
thousands of years still keep their ancient charm and attract
millions of tourists from all over the world each year.
</P>
<P>
Last year Xi'an launched an ambitious project to build a large
square in the downtown area, near the city's ancient bell and drum
tower, both dating back to the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). Twelve
huge pillars are to be erected in memory of the city's glories
during the 12 ancient dynasties.
</P>
<P>
The square is expected to open this September, when Xi'an will
host an international conference on the world's historical cities,
displaying the marvelous integration of traditional culture and
modern civilization in this ancient capital.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Cultural relics in this ancient
capital where the world-famous terracotta army was unearthed have
been well protected for several decades, despite the city's fast
pace of modernization.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an was the capital of 12 ancient Chinese dynasties during a
period of over 1,100 years. It is now the capital of northwest
China's Shaanxi Province, with over six million residents.
</P>
<P>
Also called Chang'an (Eternal Peace) in ancient times, it was
the starting point of the ancient Silk Road linking Asia and
Europe. With 84 major cultural relics under state or provincial
protection, it is called a "natural museum" of Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
Today, local officials proudly claim that they have
successfully preserved the original appearance of the ancient city
while developing it economically.
</P>
<P>
Han Ji, deputy director of the Municipal planning bureau,
attributed this achievement to a general plan for the city's
development which was mapped out in the early 1950s, shortly after
the founding of the People's Republic.
</P>
<P>
"According to this plan, reservation areas covering important
relics and ruins were set up, in which no construction projects
would be approved," he elaborated.
</P>
<P>
This decision has cost the city dearly in infrastructure
construction, he said. In 1985 it spent an extra several million
yuan in burying groundwater pipelines in order to avoid the area
where the ruins of the ancient capital of the Han Dynasty (206
B.C.-A.D.24) are located.
</P>
<P>
A similar thing happened several years later during the
construction of a suburban highway, which was extended by three km
so as to circle around the ruins of the Han and Tang dynasties
(618-907), causing a budget deficit of some 30 million yuan, he
added.
</P>
<P>
While some cities across the country regarded cultural relics
as "burdens" to their development, Xi'an decided to restrict
modern buildings in the old city proper, setting rules for their
height, size, design, and color.
</P>
<P>
When the magnificent ancient city walls were pulled down in
some cities, Xi'an made a thorough renovation of its walls built
in Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), opened them to the public for
sightseeing and entertainment, and deepened and cleaned up its
ancient city moat for floodwater storage.
</P>
<P>
Trees were planted and parks developed around separate relics
such as pagodas of the Tang Dynasty, to rule out any possibility
of unauthorized construction nearby.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Takes Steps to Overcome Power Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has initiated steps to overcome the current power
crisis if the rain fails next week to replenish the
hydro-reservoirs, official sources here said today.
</P>
<P>
The President on Thursday evening met a group of delegates from
local and foreign power suppliers to discuss the current power
situation and asked them to submit proposals for power generation.
</P>
<P>
They told her that there were ways of supplying power to the
national grid through the installation of containerized generators
and fuel operated generators.
</P>
<P>
The president asked them to be ready to supply power from early
next week particularly on a short- or medium-term basis.
</P>
<P>
She said both Japan and Germany would meet the country's long
term requirements.
</P>
<P>
Since March the country has had to experience power cuts which
are currently six hours a day, due to severe drought in the
catchment areas.
</P>
<P>
According to official assessments, there is water in the
reservoirs to generate power only till Monday, after which the
power cuts will be further extended or there will be a total
blackout.
</P>
<P>
Thermal power generated in Sri Lanka is only 9 percent of the
country's requirement. The country's industry has been adversely
affected due to the power crisis.

<HEADLINE> Somali Warlord Aidid Accuses Opponents of Calling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Somali faction leader Mohamed
Farah Aidid said today that he is ready to hold talks with his
rivals, Ali Mahdi Mohamed and Osman Hassan Ali Atto.
</P>
<P>
In the first interview General Aidid has offered since the
United Nations has departed from Somali in early March 1995, he
said that he is ready to hold open talks with his rivals, Ali
Mahdi Mohamed and Osman Hassan Ali Atto, if they refrain from
what he called the dissension and their call for foreign
involvement in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
He believes in dialogue but not force, he added.
</P>
<P>
General Aidid has accused Osman Atto for being responsible for
their "political mis-understanding by trying to persuade me to
accept foreign invlovement is Somalia's politics", an idea which
General Aidid described as illegible to the Somalis.
</P>
<P>
Aidid said he would wouldn't mind if Osman Atto rejoins his
side, noting ''Osman Atto has been one of the best waniors, but
he spoiled himself by quenching down the wrong agendas of Ali
Mahdi.''
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the recent fighting in South Mogadishu and
Huddor, Aidid explained that foreigners are fuelling the
conflicts in Somalia and he denied that an opposition group known
as RRA have seized the town of Huddor from his control.
</P>
<P>
During the interview General Aidid spoke about the foreign
intervention in Somalia. General Aidid stood very critical to the
international aid agencies and the position of the European Envoy
to Somalia, Sigurd Illing, over the political status of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
He accused the intermational aid agencies for supplying money
and weapons to the factions opposing him. He has exempted the
International Committee of the Red Cross which he commended for
their humanitarian efforts in Somalia. Aidid has faulted the aid
agencies for not assisting the needy people in the areas under
his control, ''We'd ask them to whom do they allocate our
share,'' said the General.
</P>
<P>
Aidid insisted that he is the president of Somalia and will
never retreat. ''We're elected by our people and we're determined
to serve them at our best,'' said General Aidid who claimed to be
61 year old with three wives and 14 children.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Boost Defense Ties with UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 24 (Xinhua) -- British Minister of State for
Armed Forces Nicholas Soames will visit the United Arab Emirates
(UAE) on May 27 to hold talks with senior government and armed
forces officials of this Gulf state.
</P>
<P>
Today's Emirate News quoted a British Embassy statement as
saying that "the three-day visit is aimed at finding ways to
strengthen the close relations which exist between the two
countries in the defense field."
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here said that Soames might also discuss
the defense treaty the two countries have been talking of signing
since 1993.
</P>
<P>
"Differences remain to be ironed out over jurisdiction, and
military and legal experts are still in the process of finalizing
the details of the pace," said a senior diplomat who requested on
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the British Embassy said the pact will be "one of
the topics to be discussed during the minister's visit."
</P>
<P>
During his three-day visit to Yemen and the UAE in last
November, Jeremy Hanley, the minister of state at Britain's Foreign
and Commonwealth Office, said Britain and the UAE would sign a
defense treaty soon.
</P>
<P>
The report said the delay in the signing of the pact has meant
loss of business for British defense equipment manufacturers as

<HEADLINE> Trade between UAE and Japan Increase in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The trade volume between the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Japan in 1995 witnessed a 7.8
percent increase over 1994.
</P>
<P>
There is no concrete figure of 1995, but Shigero Kimura, the
director of Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO) in Dubai,
said the trade volume between the two contries in 1994 stood at
11.4 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
A JETRO statement, which was published here today, said the
surge in the volume of trade was due to the increase in the volume
and price of crude oil imported from the UAE.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil, the major export commodity from the UAE to Japan,
accounted for more than 80 percent of the total exports to Japan
from the UAE, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
This represented a 28 percent of Japan's total crude imports
from around the world.
</P>
<P>
The JETRO director said the value of crude oil import from the
UAE during last year stood at about 8.2 billion dollars, nearly
700 million more than the 1994 figures. He said Japan remained to
be the largest buyer of mineral fuels from the UAE, including
crude oil.

<HEADLINE> Asia's Biggest Hangar Inaugurated In Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Asia's biggest hangar was
inaugurated today at the Beijing Aircraft Maintenance Engineering
Corporation which is located in the city's Capital Airport.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the four-bay hangar cost 600 million yuan
(70 million US dollars), according Dr. Stahlschmit, Ameco's
general manager.
</P>
<P>
The project consists of three parts: aircraft hangar, workshop
and office building, with a total building area of more than
50,000 square meters.
</P>
<P>
With a width of 306 meters and a depth of 95 meters, the hangar
covers an area of 35,903 square meters, roughly the size of five
soccer fields combined. Believed to be the biggest hangar in Asia,
it can accommodate four Boeing 747s for repair and six for parking.
</P>
<P>
It took three years to complete the project.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the construction of the hangar is expected to
enhance China's ability in aircraft maintenance.
</P>
<P>
With China's air traffic flow increasing at about 20 percent in
the past decade, its expanding civil airplane fleet needs more
maintenance hangar space to help ensure flight safety and
punctuality.
</P>
<P>
Ameco, a joint venture between Air China and Lufthansa, is one
of the country's four aircraft maintenance bases. It is the only
one in China able to conduct what are known as 'D checks', the
highest level in aircraft maintenance.

TOKYO, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Old people in Japan have been asked

</P>

The social security system will become increasingly important,
since caring for elderly people at home will become more difficult
due to the growing number of working women, who up to now have
mainly shouldered that task, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that older people themselves must pay more into
the social security system, which faces a financial crisis due to
the rapid rise in the cost of pensions and health insurance for
the elderly.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Young people from Taiwan, Hong Kong
and Macao, who study in Chinese mainland colleges and
universities, should enjoy the same national treatment as "home"
students.
</P>
<P>
This was raised in a latest announcement jointly issued by the
eight departments, ministries including State Education Commission
(SEC), Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, Hong Kong and
Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, Ministry of Public
Security, and Ministry of Communications.
</P>
<P>
SEC sources said today that the announcement called on relevant
departments to provide convenience to the students during their
stay in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Colleges and universities are required to charge them tuition
fees according to standards made by the SEC. Colleges and
universities are forbidden from charging them more than that
allowed, or for other items that are not listed on the SEC
standards.
</P>
<P>
Excellent Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao students can receive
scholarships provided either by the government or the school, as
excellent mainland students do.
</P>
<P>
Most often, Chinese students can enjoy up to 50 percent
discount when traveling between school and hometown during the
summer and winter vacations. They can also pay less when visiting
parks or other scenic spots.
</P>
<P>
The announcement said that Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao students
can be treated equally in the above mentioned cases with their
student cards, effective travel identification cards and pass
designed for Taiwan residents travelling in the mainland, or
certificates for Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao people visiting
hometowns.
</P>
<P>
"The students should be warmly received," the announcement
said, adding that they cannot be charged more or with other extra
fees "for being treated as foreigners."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese President And British Deputy PM Meet In Zhuhai (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, May 24 (Xinhua) -- China's President Jiang Zemin and
British Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine met in the Chinese
city of Zhuhai today.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming Heseltine, on his second China visit after the elapse
of one year, Jiang voiced appreciation to him for his positive
role in the past in resuming and improving relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
In recalling his visits to China since 1973, Heseltine said
that each of them has left him with a deep impression, and that
this visit has allowed him to meet many Chinese leaders and to
understand the bright prospects for economic and trade
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes bilateral relations in various fields can
continue to be improved and developed.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that although Britain was one of the earliest
western countries to establish diplomatic ties with China,
Sino-British relations witnessed some difficulties during the past
few years for reasons known to all.
</P>
<P>
Recently bilateral relations have shown a momentum for
improving under joint efforts, which the Chinese side is glad to
see, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that China holds that Sino-British long-term
and stable friendship and cooperation can only be based upon
mutual respect and increasing cooperation from a long-term point
of view facing the future.
</P>
<P>
So, Jiang said, leaders of the two sides should view and treat
Sino-British relations, including the Hong Kong issue, from a
strategic height taking into consideration the world's overall
situation and the next century.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also mentioned the huge British business delegation
accompanying Heseltine to China, saying that these business people
have made contact with their Chinese counterparts, and the
prospects for Sino-British economic and trade cooperation are good.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Tarim Massif Found to Have Turned 40 Degrees Clockwise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, May 24 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese geologist says the ancient
Tarim massif - one of the earth's crust plates - turned 40 degrees
clockwise and moved 12 degrees northwards about 120 million years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Geologist Li Qingchang said a joint research by Chinese
geologists and those from the Stanford University has made the
discovery.
</P>
<P>
The Tarim massif has undergone breakups and integrations, and
collisions with neighboring massifs, such as the Siberian and
Kazakhstan ones since it came into being 3.2 billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Tarim Basin covers at least 800,000 square kilometers,
about half of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Li said the Tarim massif has been covered with sea water four
times.
</P>
<P>
The discovery provides new clues for prospecting oil, natural
gas and other minerals.
</P>
<P>
Oil has been found in the Tarim Basin in recent years, and
could provide hope for China's future oil production.

<P>
On the Hong Kong issue, Jiang said, this is a very important
issue for both sides, who should keep the cooperative momentum at
present.
</P>
<P>
After the resumption of the exercise of its sovereignty over
Hong Kong, the Chinese Government will, as always, act strictly in
line with the Sino-British joint declaration, unswervingly
carrying out the principle of "one country, two systems", and
practice the policy of "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and
a high degree of autonomy, noted Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that this is not an expedient measure, but one of
China's basic policies, in a bid to realize the reunification of the
motherland and her prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there is only one year left before the resumption
of the exercise of China's sovereignty over Hong Kong, Heseltine
said that the British and Chinese governments had settled some
problems very well in the past.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that although there are still some
difficulties and disputes, the British government holds that the
close cooperation between Britain and China on the Hong Kong issue
will help the development of the overall relations.
</P>
<P>
It is in the fundamental interests of the two countries to
ensure a smooth transition of Hong Kong and keep the prosperity
and stability in Hong Kong, said Heseltine.
</P>
<P>
Thus the British side wishes to go along with the Chinese side,
continuing to adopt a constructive attitude to seriously
discussing and settling existing problems, to guarantee a smooth
transition of Hong Kong, added Heseltine.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Climber Conquers Mt. Qomolangma 10th Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Nepali climber Ang Rita Sherpa
Thursday rewrote his own world record when he reached the world's
highest Qomolangma Summit for the 10th time.
</P>
<P>
Reports from base camp said that Sherpa scaled the peak along
with two members of a Sweden expedition through the tough south
pillar route.
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old Sherpa, owner of a Kathmandu Trekking agency,
had reached the summit of world's highest mount for 10 times since
 1983, and he never used oxygen in his climbing attempts.
</P>
<P>
Besides his outstanging feat of scaling Mt. Qomolangma, Sherpa
has climbed Mt. Cho-Yu and Dhaulagiri for four times, Kanchenjunga
twice and Makalu and Sisapangma once, all these mounts above 8,000
meters.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 13 climbers of two different expeditions succeeded
in conquering the 8,848-meter summit Thursday after waiting in
their camps for good weather in the past days.
</P>
<P>
Among them were four members of a Qomolangma expedition from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
David Finlay Breashears, 41, the expedition leader, and his
teammate Edmund Karl Viesturs, 37, succeeded to reach the peak in
their third attemp. Austrian film maker Hans-Robert Schauer, 43,
also scaled the peak.
</P>
<P>
A 26-year-old Spainish physical therapist Aracei Segarra Roca
topped the summit with her teammates.
</P>
<P>
The weather in the Qomolangma region is reported to be normal
at present and all the climbers are safe.
</P>
<P>
A blizzard hitting the region earlier this month claimed nine
lives of climbers, including two Americans, two New Zealanders,
one Japanese, three Indians and one from Chinese Taipei.

<HEADLINE> First Comprehensive Fair of Iran Opens in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The first comprehensive fair ever
held in China by the Islamic Republic of Iran opened in Beijing
today.
</P>
<P>
During the seven-day event at the China International
Exhibition Center, 21 firms from Iran will display and sell
products including carpets, art and handcrafts, leather products,
silver wares, furniture and confectionary.
</P>
<P>
The fair has been organized by the Iranian Ministry of Commerce
and Export Promotion Center, and supported by the Chinese Ministry
of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (MOFTEC) and the China
Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT).
</P>
<P>
Iran's Vice-Minister of Commerce Mr. Hossein Nogrehkar Shirazi,
the Iranian Ambassador to China Mr. S.H. Mirfakhar, the Chinese
Vice-Minister of MOFTEC Sun Zhenyu, and the Vice-Chairman of the
CCPIT took part in the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Mr. H.N. Shirazi said trade
volume between Iran and China reached 504 million US dollars in
1995, but the potential for further co-operation was huge.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Shirazi said he believes that the exhibition will help the
Chinese side to understand the economic and industrial strength of
Iran, and therefore, promote the commercial ties between the two
nations.
</P>
<P>
As the 22nd Teheran International Trade Fair will be held in
October this year, Mr. Shirazi said he hopes that China will be
able to take part in the fair, as it has been doing in the past.

MADRID, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Monica Seles, world's co-No.1

<P>
LONDON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- About 200 Newcastle soccer fans
were arrested in dawn raids on Friday as police cracked down on
hooligans just two weeks before the start of the European
championship.
</P>
<P>
Police squads raided 26 homes in the north east of England
after identifying troublemakers from footage taken by closed
circuit television during a night of city centre rioting.
</P>
<P>
On May 5, hundreds of fans went on the rampage, vandalising
cars and smashing windows, after Newcastle United's final game
of the season against Tottenham.
</P>
<P>
Newcastle drew to finish premier league runners-up as big
rivals Manchester United beat Middlesbrough to win the title.
Twenty nine people were arrested immediately after the trouble.
</P>
<P>
"We have identified some 200 perpetrators responsible for a
range of offences including violent disorder, burglary, theft and
criminal damage to motor vehicles," said police superintendent
Peter Durham, in charge of Operation Harvest.
</P>
<P>
"The main target are the organisers. They are quite violent
people so it was necessary to put forward a special operation to
deal with them.
</P>
<P>
"If people think that the British police force is a soft
touch for Euro 96, they'd better think again."
</P>
<P>
Police were expected to announce any charges later in the day.
</P>
<P>
British police have prepared for hooliganism at Euro 96,
which starts on June 8, but are confident they can control any
problems. Sixteen teams are taking part in the tournament.

BONN, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Germany and China today agreed to wire
up their research-oriented computer networks to share research
data and expand educational and scientific cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The buildup of the network link was decided during a top
Chinese education official's visit here.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Kaixuan, China's Minister of State Education Commission,
arrived in Germany from Britain on Sunday for an eight-day visit

</P>
<P>
Under a protocol signed today by the two ministers, China
Education and Research Network (CERNET) and Deutsche

<HEADLINE> Yassin Calls on Followers to Suspend Attacks against Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the jailed
founder of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), has called on
his followers to suspend attacks against Israel until final
status peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians end, Israel
Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
A Hamas official, who requested on anonymity, said this was
the position of Hamas in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and of
Yassin, who was jailed by the Israeli authority in 1989 for life
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Yassin's statement was expected after two Hamas officials and
a Palestinian National Authority (PNA) official visited him in
jail to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
The suspension could mean a virtual end to attacks because
under the Oslo peace accords, the talks on the final status of the
West Bank, Jerusalem and the water issue, which began on May 5,
can take up three years to conclude.
</P>
<P>
Israel Television Channel 2 reported late Thursday night that
Israel also allowed Yassin's two sons to visit him on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted one of the two sons, following their visit,
as saying that he hoped that his father would be released after
Israel's general elections on May 29.
</P>
<P>
In a related matter, last Friday, Mahmoud Zahar, Hamas
spokesman in the Gaza Strip, called on the organization's
military wing to hold violent attacks against the Israeli targets
in the period before the elections.
</P>
<P>
But Hamas activists in Jordan said the statement did not
represent the group's position which calls for escalating attacks
against Israel.

</P>
<P>
Financial Times:

convention.

<P>
The Daily Telegraph:

</P>

<HEADLINE> Heseltine Says Visit to China Constructive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- British Deputy Prime Minister
Michael Heseltine said here today that his visit to China was
extremely constructive.
</P>
<P>
Heseltine, who led a large delegation of British industrial and
commercial leaders to China early this week, arrived in Hong Kong
after meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Zhuhai this
morning.
</P>
<P>
"The visit is one that has built on the optimism that I have
always felt towards the future of Hong Kong and now on the
continued improvement between the relationship of the United
Kingdom and China," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the conclusion he drew from the discussions in the
past few days with leaders of China is to reinforce the faith that
he has always had that China and the United Kingdom have an
identity of interest in the continued success of Hong Kong after
July 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said that leaders of China have expressed their wish to see
the success of Hong Kong continued after 1997, and the interests
of Britain are also to secure the stability and prosperity of Hong
Kong. As a result, there will evidently be continuing
negotiations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Heseltine also said the two sides sometimes do not agree, for
example, on the issue of the Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
"We have to manage that issue in a constructive way, because
solutions have to be found for the future decision making
processes. We will certainly adopt the necessarily constructive
approach to all negotiations that will take place between now and
1997," he said.

<HEADLINE> China's Fourth Largest Island Looking for Foreign Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- China's fourth biggest island is
looking to become an international ocean shipping center and is
welcoming foreign investment in building port facilities, a senior
island official said recently.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yunjin, deputy mayor of Zhoushan City, said that Zhoushan,
located at the mouth of the Yangtze River, has vast potential as a
world-class port but is not being used in that way.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that Zhoushan's 1,500-km coastline has 103 km where
the water is more than 15 m deep, which is suitable for
100,000-ton docks.
</P>
<P>
"The cost of construction here can be lower than elsewhere
because Zhoushan has many islands that help protect against
violent storms," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 1,300 islands, and Zhoushan itself has an
area of 502 sq km, roughly the size of the major island of
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The deputy mayor explained that Zhoushan can counter the
defects of Shanghai, which is hampered by the shallow depth of its
port and lack of 100,000-ton docks.
</P>
<P>
Zhoushan has more than 80 docks, ranging in size from 500 to
200,000 tons. Last year, it had a turnover of over 10 million
tons, and plans to build six more docks ranging in size from
50,000 to 300,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, this is a long-term project and can really move
only when more capital is injected, so "We welcome investors from
all over the world, using various forms of investment."
</P>
<P>
He said his city also plans to build five bridges connecting
major islands and that the city is preparing to build a 7.5
km-bridge linking the island of Jintang, the closest to the
continent, with Ningbo Port.
</P>
<P>
"The bridges will need a total of 5.7 billion yuan, but
domestically, there is a severe shortage of funds," he said, "so
foreign businessmen have a lot of room to manoeuvre here in making
up for the void left by domestic investors."
</P>
<P>
Jintang has an 84 sq km area, more than 50 km bigger than Daxie
Island, where the China International Trust and Investment
Corporation (CITIC) has a contract for development. Jintang is a
bit quiet, however.
</P>
<P>
The deputy mayor said that Zhoushan's government would like to
develop Jintang island and that foreign businesses can be set up
here for chemical industry, transportation, shipbuilding, and
repair work.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the city's first and only airport will be built
by the end of this year, concluding, "With the ports, we can float
across the world; with planes, our city can take wing in
development."

<HEADLINE> Gaddafi to Visit Egypt for Talks with Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi will
arrive in Cairo Saturday for talks with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi is scheduled to arrive in Marsa Matruh, an Egyptian
Mediterranean port city, some 200 kilometers east of the
Egyptian-Libyan border, later today, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
He will put up for the night in the city and leave Saturday
morning for Cairo, accompanied by Egyptian Minister of Information
Safwat el-Sherif, MENA said without giving more details.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi last visited Egypt in January, when he held talks with
Mubarak at a military base at Sidi Barrani, some 80 kilometers
east of the Egyptian-Libyan border.
</P>
<P>
Because of the air ban, Gaddafi would have to travel to Egypt
by land.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed air, arms and diplomatic embargo on
Libya in April 1992 after Libya refused to comply with a Western
demand for extraditing two Libyan nationals, who were suspected of
bombing an Pan Am passenger plane over Lockerbie, Scotland, in
1988. A total of 270 people were killed in the bombing.

<HEADLINE> ANC Called to Back Mandela on Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 24 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's National Party
(NP), the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and the Democratic Party
(DP) called on the African National Congress (ANC) to support
President Nelson Mandela on issues of privatization, a local
daily ''The Citizen'' reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Berlin yesterday on the last day of
his three-day state visit to Germany, Mandela assured German
bankers that his ANC-led government is committed to
privatisation.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said privatisation should be a gradual process, taking
into the account the conditions under which it had to be brought
about.
</P>
<P>
Privatisation is a fundamental government policy, said the
president, adding ''We have to discuss it with our partners and
make sure that we take them aboard in what we do''.
</P>
<P>
He is referring to the ANC's alliance with Congress of South
African Trade Unions, which is strongly opposed to privatisation.
</P>
<P>
NP finance spokesman Theo Alant said yesterday that President
Mandela, as leader of the ANC, should first get his own economic
house in order before asking foreign governments for ''ethical
investments'' in the country.
</P>
<P>
DP leader Tony Leon said that unless Mandela and the ANC
government matched the sentiment expressed abroad with harsh and
tough decisions at home, no banker and no foreign investor was
going to believe the credibility of the message.
</P>
<P>
however, the IFP said in a statement that it would cooperate
with the ANC and offer its expertise in free-market economies.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Trevor Manuel reiterated on
Thursday that the South African government is not about to have a
''fire sale'' of state assets, adding the government is
''painfully aware'' of the pressures for it to move rapidly on
privatisation.
</P>
<P>
In this respect, Manuel called on business and labour not to
pressurise the government on its privatisation policy, saying it
was motivated by a series of factors other than narrow
ideological aims.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Government Works Out Export Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government has
reportedly worked out a strategy to gradually increase the volume
of processed and refined goods in the country's export.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the strategy, according to a local press report
today, is to bring up the value of its export products.
</P>
<P>
Under the strategy, the industry's goals will include
diversifying export goods, broadening export markets, and shifting
to production and export of refined and processed goods.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese exporters are also urged to adopt measures to limit
environmental pollution in the production process of export goods.
</P>
<P>
In the last ten years, the industry focused on exporting crude
and semi-processed goods such as oil, rice and coffee.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, Vietnam's export markets have been extended to the
Asia-Pacific region, which accounts for 80 percent of the
country's total export value. Meanwhile, its export revenue has
increased annually by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The total export earnings in the 1986-1995 period reached more
than 19 billion U.S. dollars, mainly from semi-processed farm
products such as rice, coffee, cashew nuts and rubber.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is targeting an export turnover of 45 billion dollars
under the government's economic development plan for the next five
years up to year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Sri lanka to Advance Standard Time by One Hour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 24 (Xinhua)-- In the light of the present power
crisis, the Sri Lankan government today decided to advance the
country's standard time by one hour in order to effect daylight
savings, according to informed sources here.
</P>
<P>
At midnight tonight, Friday, May 24th, 1996, the time would be
advanced to 1:00 a.m., Saturday, May 25th, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that in effect, all clocks would be advanced
at 12 midnight tonight to read 1:00 a.m.. This implies that the
Sri Lanka Standard time is advanced by one hour from midnight
tonight. Effective tonight, the Sri Lankan standard time would be
six and a half hours ahead of Greenwich Meridian Time (G.M.T.).
</P>
<P>
The sources explained that when the clocks are "advanced" by
one hour, the usual activities are performed one hour earlier. As
a result, in the evenings, at dusk, there is one hour 'extra' of
sunlight whilst in the mornings, at dawn, there is one hour less
of sunlight.
</P>
<P>
As intensity of activities in the evenings is greater than
intensity of activities in the early mornings, there is an overall
saving of electricity use. It is expected that the savings by
advancing the clock by one hour would amount to about 250,000
units (KWH) per day.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that the government requests the co-operation
of every citizen to implement this scheme successfully.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Peace with Israel Is Best Way to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat has declared that peace with Israel is the best
way to create a Palestinian state, reported Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the statement when he was addressing the
legislative Palestinian Council in Gaza on Thursday. He added
that he is committed to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The statement, which came just one week before the Israeli
general elections, appears to imply that Arafat supports his
peace partner Prime Minister Shimon Peres in the May 29
elections. Arafat and his aides are now convinced that a Likud
victory would be nothing short of a disaster, both for them and
the future of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Likud has stated its intention to resume settlement
activity and to take a hard line in any further negotiations with
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The recent cancellation of offending clauses in the
Palestinian National Charter, pushed through by Arafat himself,
was meant as a major gesture to Peres.
</P>
<P>
The PA is making every effort to keep lid on Hamas and Islamic
Jihad terrorism for fear that a preelection suicide bombing
should blow peres' chances to win.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also said at Thursday's PC session that his
security forces had made mistakes in the way of treating Hamas
prisoners. He suggested that those committed wrong-doings should
be punished.
</P>
<P>
He declared that he will start releasing those who are
students, to allow them to take exams.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 700 of the 900 Islamic
militants arrested by Palestinian police after a spate of Hamas
suicide bombings in Israel still remain in Jail.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Ban Crust Leather Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
decided to ban export of crust leather to raise export earnings
from finished leather and leather products.
</P>
<P>
Official sources today said that the export policy 1995-1997
includes the ban which will be effective from July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The policy indicates that all the leather units producing
semi-processed leather and crust leather would be able to
manufacture finished leather and leather products by 1997, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
In order to encourage leather exporters to raise value addition
from their exports, the government has declared those leather
units exporting 80 percent of products as 100 percent
export-oriented.
</P>
<P>
The export-oriented leather units will be given bonded
facilities to enable them to import raw materials including raw
leather, pickled, wetblue, crust and finished leather components,
dyes and chemicals.

U.S. dollars) in 1995, a 12 percent increase over 1994, according
to figures released by the Economy Ministry today.
</P>
<P>
The export boom has halved Germany's trade deficit with the
region from 17.3 billion marks (11.2 billion dollars) to 8.5
billion marks (5.5 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the rise in exports mainly to a program
known as the Asia Initiative, launched jointly by the German
government and industries.
</P>
<P>
Trade with the Asia-Pacific accounted for 16 percent of the
country's total foreign trade, making the region Germany's second
biggest trading partner after Europe, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Most German exports, mainly machinery, automobiles and
electronics, went to South Korea and Southeast Asia. Imports such
as textiles, food and electronic products came mainly from South
Korea and Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> TV Spotlight on China's Rural Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- A documentary aiming to arouse the
public interest towards education in rural areas is set to make
its screen debut in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The TV documentary "Lighting the Candles", based on the stories
of 26 rural teachers, is to be screened by Beijing TV from next
month.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the documentary is to show the public the moving
stories of teachers, not employed by the government, who devote
themselves to education in rural areas under poor living and
working conditions.
</P>
<P>
The documentary demonstrates to the general public that helping
one teacher like those featured mean that more farmers' children
can be educated.
</P>
<P>
The documentary was completed in nine months, with major
filming shot in the counties of Fuping and Mancheng in north
China's Hebei province.
</P>
<P>
Funds for the documentary were donated by 33 individual
volunteers who earnestly support education in rural areas. One of
them died before the completion of the documentary.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that currently some 60 percent out of 6.4
million teachers who are working in rural primary and middle
schools are teachers who are not paid by the governments.

<HEADLINE> Southwest China's Iron, Steel Base in Advance  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANZHIHUA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- An iron and steel capital in
southwest China rising from a desolate area of barren land has
been steeling itself for massive expansion as it heads towards the
new century.
</P>
<P>
Panzhihua City in Sichuan province, has been turned into one
of China's key iron and steel and energy production bases.
</P>
<P>
Now the city plans to open even wider to the outside world by
tapping its rich natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Qin Wanxiang, mayor of the city, said "Panzhihua's rising
economy will play an important role in narrowing the gap between
the east and the west, and in promoting prosperity and maintaining
stability in the remote mountainous areas, where ethnic minority
groups live in compact communities."
</P>
<P>
Located on the banks of the Jinsha River, Panzhihua covers
7,434 square kilometers, and has a population of 961,000. It has
34 ethnic minority groups with a population of 117,000, accounting
for 12 percent of the city's total.
</P>
<P>
The city is endowed with unique mineral, water power, favorable
climate, biology and tourism resources.
</P>
<P>
A survey shows that Panzhihua has verified reserves of 47
minerals, of which vanadium iron and magnetic iron ore rank second
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The city, which is crisscrossed with the Jinsha and Yalong
river systems, has a dozen sites available for building large
hydroelectric power stations.
</P>
<P>
Construction of Panzhihua was a key strategical policy made by
the central government in the early 1960s to help ensure China's
lasting political stability and tapping the abundant local
resources.
</P>
<P>
To speed its construction and development, the central
government designated Panzhihua as a special zone in 1965, and
concentrated funds, manpower and materials on the construction.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Panzhihua began to turn out steel in 1971 and
rolled steel in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Now the formerly barren land has developed into a rising
industrial city and a heavy industrial base in western China.
</P>
<P>
It has an annual production capacity of three million tons of
iron, three million tons of steel, 2.4 million tons of steel
products, 100,000 tons of vanadium products and 100,000 tons of
titanium goods, six million tons of coal and one million tons of
cement.

<P>
The city already has supplied other parts of China with 50
million tons of iron and steel, energy and machinery and electric
products, as well as 33,000 people of ability.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the second stage of the Panzhihua Iron and

supportive facilities are currently proceeding well.
</P>
<P>
"They are expected to play a leading role in helping boost
Southwest China's economy upon completion," Qin noted.
</P>
<P>
The mayor acknowledged that the remote geographic location and
the historical background of developing under the intensive
central planning system and keeping away from worldwide, has
affected its view of opening wider to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
To boost export-oriented economy and make it known to the
world, the city government has not only made contact with other
cities across the country, but also voluntarily sponsored a
package of international conferences, such as an international
conference to prove Panzhihua's strategy of economic and social
development, an international meeting on vanadium and titanium, an
international seminar on agricultural development in hilly areas,
and the fourth international conference on sago cycas.
</P>
<P>
While continuously improving its urban infrastructure
facilities and services, Panzhihua has worked out preferential
policies in favor to overseas investors. It has 23 foreign-funded
enterprises involving a total investment of 1.69 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the mayor, Panzhihua has become an economic center
in the area bordering on Sichuan and Yunnan provinces.

HARARE, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Malaria has killed more than 1,300
Zimbabwean people this year, a senior official of the Ministry of

<P>
A medical officer in the ministry's Epidemiology Department,

" Some people die at home and we never know of them. We also
rely on figures from those clinics we are able to communicate

Mungwariri said.
</P>
<P>
There was a major outbreak of Malaria following good rains
this season after Zimbabwe had experienced recurrent drought.
</P>
<P>
At least 502,880 cases of malaria had been attended to around
the country since the begining of the year.
</P>
<P>
Although the numbers were still that high, Mungwariri said,
cases of malaria now appeared to be on a downward trend.

counterparts and the local people.
</P>
<P>
In Addis Ababa, where the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
is based, Jiang delivered a speech entitled "Toward a New
Historical Milestone in Sino-African Friendship."
</P>
<P>
Jiang and his six African counterparts extensively exchanged
views and reached consensus on further consolidating and
developing their cooperation and other matters of common
concern. He also met with the chiefs of the OAU and the Arab
League.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government signed 23 documents with the six
governments on economic and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the African press as saying President Jiang's
visit pushed to a new high Sino-African contacts and close
political relations, which have a long history.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese and African peoples, who enjoy a longstanding
friendship, have never had any grudge against each other, the
paper declared. "Sharing weal and woe, they have always
sympathized with and supported each other in their prolonged
struggles for national independence and liberation."
</P>
<P>
With the birth of the People's Republic of China and the
gaining of independence from colonial rule by a host of African
countries, the paper said, ties between the two sides entered a
new period of all-round development.
</P>
<P>
The first generation of leaders of New China and the
forefathers of African national liberation movements together laid
down a solid foundation for Sino-African relations and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Exchanges of visits by new-generation leaders in China and
Africa have further promoted mutual understanding and given fresh
impetus to the steady development of Sino-African friendship and
cooperation, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
It said President Jiang's trip to Africa indicated that it is
the Chinese government's consistent basic policy and the Chinese
people's earnest wish to maintain the friendly ties with African
nations generation after generation.
</P>
<P>
Endowed with vast land and rich natural resources, the paper
said, Africa boasts enormous potential for economic development.
</P>
<P>
African peoples, with a peace-loving and progress-seeking
tradition, have always been a main force in maintaining world
peace and stability, the paper said. "Global peace and prosperity
are impossible without stability and development in Africa."

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Hails Jiang's Successful Africa Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily in the editorial
called on the international community to attach importance to
Africa, saying, "Africa needs the world and the world needs Africa
as well."
</P>
<P>
China believes that African nations should have a bigger say in
international affairs and the international community should
respect the views of these nations and the OAU. The international
community, especially the developed countries, should relief
Africa's debt burdens and improve the external conditions for its
development.
</P>
<P>
China and African nations have always supported and helped each
other in international affairs and in their respective countries'
development, the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
China always backs African nations in their just struggle for
safeguarding national independence, sovereignty and dignity. China
respects their choices of political system and road for
development. It also supports their efforts to maintain domestic
stability and unity, reinvigorate their national economy and
promote social progress, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The paper expressed the belief that political independence
serves as the precondition for economic independence, which in
turn constitutes the material basis for political independence.
</P>
<P>
China, as always, will continue to provide, within its own
means, government assistance to African countries with no
political strings attached, it said.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the international situation is on the whole
moving toward relaxation and the trend toward multipolarity is
making further headway. The world needs peace, nations want
stability and society demands progress. This has become the
prevailing trend in the world today.
</P>
<P>
But, the world is far from tranquil as hegemonism and power
politics still exist, the gap between rich and poor countries
keeps widening and thus formidable challenges remain to peace and
development.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, strengthening Sino-African unity and
cooperation is of great significance for safeguarding world peace,
seeking joint development and establishing a just and reasonable
new international political and economic order, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
As this century draws to an end, China cherishes even more its
friendly cooperation with African nations.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the OAU, Jiang pledged solemnly that his
country is ready to consolidate and develop a long-term and stable
relationship of all-round cooperation with all African nations --
a relationship that will be carried over into the 21st century --
on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.
</P>
<P>
He also raised five proposals and observations for developing
Sino-African relations under the new situation. They are: to
foster a sincere friendship and become each other's "all-weather
friend," to treat each other as equals, respect each other's
sovereignty and refrain from interfering in each other's internal
affairs, to seek common development on the basis of mutual
benefit, to increase consultation and cooperation in international
affairs, and to look into the future and create a more splendid
world.
</P>
<P>
These proposals conform to the fundamental interests of China
and Africa, keep abreast of the historical trend and will inject
new vitality into the Sino-African friendship.
</P>
<P>
The paper described the Chinese president's visit to Africa as
"historic" and "of great significance and far-reaching influence,"
not only on the Sino-African relations, but also on the world
people's lofty effort for peace and development.
</P>
<P>
As Jiang declared in his speech at the OAU, China, the biggest
developing country in the world, is ready to join hands with
Africa, the world's biggest developing continent, to share weal
and woe with it and to fight for the creation of a better world
together with it.

BANGKOK, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Finance Ministry has

which are adversely affected by recent tariff cuts on imports of
luxury goods.
</P>
<P>
Planned import tariff cuts on raw materials for four industries
-- textiles and garments, leather products, cosmetics and shoes,
are meant to reduce local production cost and to protect Thai
manufacturers who earn billions of baht (25 baht to the U.S.
dollar) for Thailand each year.

Thailand last week decided to reduce import duty on 13
categories of luxury goods in order to attract foreign tourists

MEXICO CITY, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo today expressed his government's firm willingness to
continue peace negotiations in the southeastern state of Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo, who is in Chiapas in a working tour, said his
government has the unbreakable decision to hold dialogue without
double talks or hidden purposes.
</P>
<P>
"I reiterate that the government advocates peace with dignity
and seeks reconciliation with respect," he said.

</P>
<P>
The president reaffirmed his commitment to the dialogue to have
Chiapas live in peace, respect, dignity and justice.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo's visit to Chiapas came amid tension caused by
Zapatista National Liberation Army who has threatened to abandon
the next round of talks scheduled for June after two Zapatista
suspects were jailed,
</P>
<P>
The talks between the government and the Zapatistas who rose up
in arms in January 1994 were obstructed last month when a judge in

<HEADLINE> Spanish Civil Guard General Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, May 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior general in the Spanish
Civil Guard has been arrested as a suspect in the kidnapping,
torture and murder of two presumed Basque guerrillas during a
1980s campaign against the separatists.
</P>
<P>
Backed by evidence from a former Civil Guard officer and
several secret documents, High Court judge Javier Gomez today
subpoenaed General Enrique Rodriguez Galindo to answer some 70
questions about the deaths in 1995 of two presumed members of the
separatist ETA (Basque Homeland and Liberty), Jose Lasa and Jose
Zabala.
</P>
<P>
Galindo refused to answer any of the questions and read a
statement, denying all the charges.
</P>
<P>
Gomez then ordered the detention of Galindo in a military jail.
</P>
<P>
The detention of the respected general has provoked mixed
reactions.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja said the two-week-old
conservative government respected the High Court's decision and is
mulling the general's removal from office.
</P>
<P>
Galindo served as chief advisor to the Interior Ministry and
the paramilitary Civil Guard.
</P>
<P>
However, Mayor's Socialist predecessors, Jose Barrionuevo and
Jose Corcuera, insisted at a news conference that Galindo is
innocent. They said they would share responsibility with Galindo
and would gladly go to jail too.
</P>
<P>
Basque nationalists welcomed the arrest. They said they had
long suspected Galindo's involvement in the death squads known as
the GAL (Anti-Terrorist Liberation Groups).
</P>
<P>
Galindo worked in the northern Basque region for 26 years
combating ETA rebels.
</P>
<P>
The general was charged earlier this month for his role in the
murder of another ETA member, Ramon Onaederra, in a separate
case.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica Protests U.S. Unfair Trade Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica is being victimized by
U.S. unilateral measures against free trade, a Costa Rican
official said today.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican Vice Foreign Trade Minister Francisco Chacon made
the remarks today after some member countries of the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) criticized the
U.S. economic measures for contravening the World Trade
Organization (WTO) rules.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting in Paris, OECD countries condemned the
U.S. sanctions against Cuba and the intention to impose trade
restrictions on China and those countries with economic interests
in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The vice minister said his country has been victimized by the
U.S. policy of imposing unilateral restrictions in commercial
matters.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica has to demand a WTO panel resolve a controversy with
the United States, which tries to impose quotas on the exports of
textile products made by Costa Rica's in-bound industry.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Commerce and some U.S. Congress sectors
want trade sanctions imposed against Costa Rica because of a
dispute over the standards applied by the European Union to Costa
Rican banana exports.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. company estimates that the European standards affect its
interests and is using its influence to promote the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Chacon also said environmental arguments are being used against
the export of some Costa Rican products to the U.S. market, which
is the most important for Costa Rica because 42 percent of its
products are for export to the U.S. market.

PANAMA CITY, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Panama
are discussing the stationing of U.S. military bases in Panama
beyond the year 2000, U.S. Ambassador William Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in their ongoing negotiations, the two governments

The United States will have to pull out its military forces from

<HEADLINE> Spain Seizes 2,000kg of Cocaine in High Seas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Spanish customs officers Wednesday
seized nearly 2,000 kilograms of cocaine and arrested six
suspected drug traffickers from a merchant ship in the high seas,
an official with the government's anti-drug campaign said today.
</P>
<P>
The ship, flying the Swedish flag, was boarded 900 nautical
miles from Spain's Canary Islands, the official told a press
conference in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
Eight customs officers who boarded the vessel found the cocaine
in 65 packages, he said.
</P>
<P>
The crew, all Spaniards, confessed that the cocaine, taken on
in South America, was to be unloaded in Spain and transported to a
European destination inland.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the biggest drug seizures in Spain in recent
years, the official said.
</P>
<P>
On January 30, 1996, custom officers found in a Cape Verde
fishing boat 2,580 kilograms of cocaine worth more than 960
million U.S. dollars. A year before, 2,500 kilograms of cocaine
were seized in a Panamanian oil tanker near Spain's northwest
Galicia region.
</P>
<P>
Spanish anti-narcotics officials believe that the passage
between the coast of West Africa and Spain is a major route for
the trafficking of drugs from South America to Europe.

NEW DELHI, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The voting on the motion to be
tabled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) minority government to
seek the confidence of the 11th Lok Sabha (lower house of
parliament) will take place on May 28, the Patriot reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to Lok Sabha Secretariat sources, newly-elected
speaker Purno A. Sangma made the ruling after the leaders of all
parties failed to come to any decision on the matter at a meeting
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The BJP government announced at the meeting that the one-line
motion, which reads "This house expresses its confidence in the
Council of Ministers," would be tabled on May 27.
</P>
<P>
The government wanted a three-day debate on the issue, but the
opposition insisted that it should be voted upon without any
discussion.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the parties then asked Sangma to take a decision
on the matter.  The speaker decided that May 28 should be the
date for the vote of confidence.
</P>
<P>
With only 195 seats including those of its allies, the BJP
government is believed to have little chance to survive a vote of
confidence in the new Lok Sabha which has 537 seats elected so
far.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Hails Jiang's Successful Africa Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily, China's most
prominent newspaper, today carried a front-page editorial hailing
Chinese President Jiang Zemin's just-concluded six-nation Africa
tour as a great success.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's 15-day tour, which began on May 8 and took him to
Kenya, Ethiopia, Egypt, Mali, Namibia and Zimbabwe, fully embodied
the spirit of equality, faithful friendship, unity and cooperation
and joint development, the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
It also constituted a historical monument in the Sino-African
relations and added a new chapter to the annals of China's unity
and cooperation with developing nations, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
Wherever he went, it pointed out, the Chinese president was
accorded the warmest welcome and hospitality by his African
counterparts and the local people.
</P>
<P>
In Addis Ababa, where the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
is based, Jiang delivered a speech entitled "Toward a New
Historical Milestone in Sino-African Friendship."
</P>
<P>
Jiang and his six African counterparts extensively exchanged
views and reached consensus on further consolidating and
developing their cooperation and other matters of common
concern. He also met with the chiefs of the OAU and the Arab
League.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government signed 23 documents with the six
governments on economic and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the African press as saying President Jiang's
visit pushed to a new high Sino-African contacts and close
political relations, which have a long history.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese and African peoples, who enjoy a longstanding
friendship, have never had any grudge against each other, the
paper declared. "Sharing weal and woe, they have always
sympathized with and supported each other in their prolonged
struggles for national independence and liberation."
</P>
<P>
With the birth of the People's Republic of China and the
gaining of independence from colonial rule by a host of African
countries, the paper said, ties between the two sides entered a
new period of all-round development.
</P>
<P>
The first generation of leaders of New China and the
forefathers of African national liberation movements together laid
down a solid foundation for Sino-African relations and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Exchanges of visits by new-generation leaders in China and
Africa have further promoted mutual understanding and given fresh
impetus to the steady development of Sino-African friendship and
cooperation, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
It said President Jiang's trip to Africa indicated that it is
the Chinese government's consistent basic policy and the Chinese
people's earnest wish to maintain the friendly ties with African
nations generation after generation.
</P>
<P>
Endowed with vast land and rich natural resources, the paper
said, Africa boasts enormous potential for economic development.
</P>
<P>
African peoples, with a peace-loving and progress-seeking
tradition, have always been a main force in maintaining world
peace and stability, the paper said. "Global peace and prosperity
are impossible without stability and development in Africa."
</P>
<P>
The paper in the editorial called on the international
community to attach importance to Africa, saying, "Africa needs
the world and the world needs Africa as well."
</P>
<P>
China believes that African nations should have a bigger say in
international affairs and the international community should
respect the views of these nations and the OAU. The international
community, especially the developed countries, should relief
Africa's debt burdens and improve the external conditions for its
development.
</P>
<P>
China and African nations have always supported and helped each
other in international affairs and in their respective countries'
development, the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
China always backs African nations in their just struggle for
safeguarding national independence, sovereignty and dignity. China
respects their choices of political system and road for
development. It also supports their efforts to maintain domestic
stability and unity, reinvigorate their national economy and
promote social progress, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The paper expressed the belief that political independence
serves as the precondition for economic independence, which in
turn constitutes the material basis for political independence.
</P>
<P>
China, as always, will continue to provide, within its own
means, government assistance to African countries with no
political strings attached, it said.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the international situation is on the whole
moving toward relaxation and the trend toward multipolarity is
making further headway. The world needs peace, nations want
stability and society demands progress. This has become the
prevailing trend in the world today.
</P>
<P>
But, the world is far from tranquil as hegemonism and power
politics still exist, the gap between rich and poor countries
keeps widening and thus formidable challenges remain to peace and
development.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, strengthening Sino-African unity and
cooperation is of great significance for safeguarding world peace,
seeking joint development and establishing a just and reasonable
new international political and economic order, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
As this century draws to an end, China cherishes even more its
friendly cooperation with African nations.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the OAU, Jiang pledged solemnly that his
country is ready to consolidate and develop a long-term and stable
relationship of all-round cooperation with all African nations --
a relationship that will be carried over into the 21st century --
on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.
</P>
<P>
He also raised five proposals and observations for developing
Sino-African relations under the new situation. They are: to
foster a sincere friendship and become each other's "all-weather
friend," to treat each other as equals, respect each other's
sovereignty and refrain from interfering in each other's internal
affairs, to seek common development on the basis of mutual
benefit, to increase consultation and cooperation in international
affairs, and to look into the future and create a more splendid
world.
</P>
<P>
These proposals conform to the fundamental interests of China
and Africa, keep abreast of the historical trend and will inject
new vitality into the Sino-African friendship.
</P>
<P>
The paper described the Chinese president's visit to Africa as
"historic" and "of great significance and far-reaching influence,"
not only on the Sino-African relations, but also on the world
people's lofty effort for peace and development.
</P>
<P>
As Jiang declared in his speech at the OAU, China, the biggest
developing country in the world, is ready to join hands with
Africa, the world's biggest developing continent, to share weal
and woe with it and to fight for the creation of a better world
together with it.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin to Visit Chechnya After Talks With Rebel Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 23 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin said today
that he will visit the war-battered Chechnya after his upcoming
direct talks with the new Chechen separatist leader, Zelimkhan
Yandarbiyev, in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
"I will go to Grozny (capital of Chechnya) and Yandarbiyev to
Moscow. He will be the first, I will follow," said Yeltsin during
a campaign trip to the city of Arkhangelsk, 800 kilometers north
of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by Yandarbiyev's readiness to resume peace talks,
Yeltsin said, "The ice has begun to break -- agreement will be
reached."
</P>
<P>
After a brief visit to Arkhangelsk, Yeltsin will fly to
Vorkuta, the center of a coal-mining region in the northeast,
before returning to Moscow Sunday or Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Chechen conflict, which erupted in December 1994 after
Yeltsin sent troops and tanks to quash the independence drive
launched by Yandarbiyev's predecessor, Dzhokhar Dudayev, has been
used by Yeltsin's rivals to weaken his popularity.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who himself has admitted that the conflict is a major
obstacle to his re-election bid, had offered to hold talks with
Chechen rebels through an intermediary and said he would go to
Chechnya despite insecurity there.
</P>
<P>
But earlier today, the Geneva-based Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said Yeltsin had agreed to hold
face-to-face talks with Yandarbiyev in the near future. The news
was quickly confirmed by Yeltsin's spokesman Sergei Medvedev.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE also said that under the mediation of its delegates, a
preliminary agreement had been reached between Moscow and the
rebels to resume talks on the implementation of a 1995 Chechen
peace accord. The accord has been reduced to a scrap of paper
after Dudayev refused to abandon his independence bid starting in
1991.
</P>
<P>
Medvedev said Yeltsin promised to "guarantee the security of
Yandarbiyev and other members of his delegation."
</P>
<P>
Yandarbiyev, who took over as the new rebel chief after Dudayev
was killed by a Russian missile attack late last month, has
reportedly softened his hardline stance and agreed to halt
military operations, restart peace talks and de-link the
independence of Chechnya with the talks.
</P>
<P>
Medvedev did not give an exact date for the meeting but said
Yeltsin "is set to have the talks begin as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
Sergei Stepashin, the executive secretary of the State
Commission for the Chechen Settlement, said the talks would happen
"much earlier than the June 16 presidential elections" and focus
on the military sphere.
</P>
<P>
But in the battlefield, there was no sign of relaxation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Russian federal troops seized the village of
Bamut in southwestern Chechnya, one of Chechen rebels' final major
strongholds, after several days of fierce fighting, and began a
mop-up operation there. During the battle, 23 Russian servicemen
and about 300 to 350 rebels were killed.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Bamut battle, the Russian president's
analytical center stressed that the complete seizure of Bamut will
hasten a political settlement.
</P>
<P>
The center forecast that the loss of Bamut will generate more
splits among the rebels and prevent their field commanders from
joining separate factions.
</P>
<P>
The center also expressed concern over the reports that rebels
have obtained anti-aircraft weapons, in particular
shoulder-launched Stinger missiles.
</P>
<P>
Chechen rebel field commander Shamil Basayev, who led the
terrorist attack on Budennovsk in southern Russia last summer, was
reportedly preparing to assassinate Yeltsin during his proposed
trip to Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Basayev has set up three groups of militants, with 40 people
each, to carry out the assassination attempt. Among the selected
assassins are 70 foreign mercenaries.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in Peru Reaches 8 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in Peru has
increased seven-fold since 1990 to 8 billion dollars, Council of
Ministers President Alberto Pandolfi Arbulu said today.
</P>
<P>
The level of foreign investment reflects the success of the
economic program by the government of President Alberto Fujimori,
who took office in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian macroeconomic stability has permitted the country to
be reinserted successfully into the international finances that
will allow it to receive more credits from the International
Monetary Fund during the 1996-1998 period, said Pandolfi Arbulu.
</P>
<P>
The government will get 15 billion dollars from the sale of
public enterprises, which will end in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Privatization is essential for the government program, since it
will encourage private investment and the arrival of foreign
capital, added Pandolfi Arbulu.

<HEADLINE> France Defends Armed Intervention in Central African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 23 (Xinhua) -- The French government today defended
its armed intervention in Central African Republic, saying that
the action was at the request of the legitimate authorities and is
aimed at restoring peace there.
</P>
<P>
The French action was requested by the government of Central
African Republic, which is confronted with an extremely difficult
situation, said Foreign Ministry Spokesman Yves Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
France could not ignore the appeal of the country's legitimate,
democratically elected authorities and refuse to help end the
crisis and restore peace there, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said French forces will help defend important installations,
such as the radio station, without which a return to normality and
the pursuit of negotiations will be jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation Minister Jacques Godfrain said that the French
operation would ensure the security of French nationals, other
foreigners and certain Central Africans.
</P>
<P>
He said it was essential for France not to be involved in the
political problems of Central Africa, which should be settled by
the Central Africans themselves through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Tensions are high in Bangui, capital of Central African
Republic, after soldiers mutinied against President Ange-Felix
Patasse last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
France sent 500 of its troops stationed in Africa to the
Republic and flew from France 100 heavily-armed troops to protect
the foreigners there.
</P>
<P>
Residents of Bangui demonstrated today to protest against the
French intervention and burned down a French cultural center.
</P>
<P>
French-speaking countries in Africa are cautious about the
French military operation, and several have remained silent about
it.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Resigned Thai Deputy Minister Not to Seek </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Interior Minister
Suchart Tancharoen, who resigned Thursday together with four other
minister and deputy ministers of the Therd Thai faction, has
agreed not to seek a reappointment in the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
This has made the prime minister feel relieved regarding the
forthcoming cabinet reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Suchart, a key member of the powerful Therd Thai faction in
Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa's Chart Thai (Thai Nation)
Party, got the least number of supporting votes in the
no-confidence vote two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The opposition accused him of making personal gains through
abuse of power by obtaining bank loans through putting up
overvalued collateral and he was also charged with involvement in
land ownership scandals.
</P>
<P>
The Palang Dharma (virtue force) Party, which abstained from
voting on Suchart, demanded that Suchart, who was considered not
acceptable to the public, be removed from the cabinet, or it may
quit the seven-party coalition government.
</P>
<P>
After the voting, Suchart strongly demanded expulsion of the
Palang Dharma from the government coalition for its abstention and
he himself refused to leave the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The four other Therd Thai faction members, who resigned
thursday from the cabinet, are University Affairs Minister Boonchu
Trithong, Deputy Finance Minister Newin Chidchob, Deputy Commerce
Minister Pairote Suwanchawee, and Deputy Industry Minister Anusorn
Wongwan.
</P>
<P>
The resigned minister and deputy ministers are to be replaced
by people from the same faction, which claims to hold 29 seats in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Had Suchart insisted on holding onto his post, or being
transferred to another cabinet posting, it could cause dilemma for
the Palang Dharma party: to be, or not to be, in the government,
that would be the question, because the Palang Dharma has vowed
not to work with Suchart in the same cabinet.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Ruling Party Chief Criticizes Coalition Partner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 24 (Xinhua) -- President of Nepal's main ruling
Nepali Congress (NC) Party Girija Prasad Koirala Thursday openly
accused a coalition partner of leading to another cabinet
expansion, local newspapers reported.
</P>
<P>
Koirala lashed out at the National Democratic Party (RPP), the
second ruling party in the three-party coalition, Thursday at a
program in east Nepal's Sunsari district, stating that the lust
for ministerial posts within the RPP was growing and thus posing
great difficulties for his party, Kathmandu Post said today.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba last week expanded his
44-strong cabinet by adding one state minister and three assistant
ministers in an attempt to make the government more stable.
</P>
<P>
Koirala was quoted by the paper as saying that the three
coalition partners have failed to display collective
responsibility, raising questions about the very life of this
government.
</P>
<P>
However, Koirala, who was elected NC president two weeks ago,
earlier had promised to cooperate with the NC-led government and
help it fulfill its full term.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi army has decided to move
back all its tanks to the cantonment from the capital city of
Dhaka with the restoration of complete normalcy following an
abortive mutiny on May 20.
</P>
<P>
The military said in a press release that the withdrawal will
start this morning and "there is nothing to be worried" now.
</P>
<P>
Some troops loyal to the deposed chief of army staff A.S.M.
Nasim in the northern part of the country attempted to launch the
mutiny through march towards Dhaka following Nasim's forced
retirement by the Defense Ministry under the country's President
Abdur Rahman Biswas, who is also commander-in-chief of the armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that army personnel deployed at the television
and radio stations in the capital following the May 20 incident
were already withdrawn Thursday.
</P>

"All units of officers and troops vacated the TV center at
Rampura and the radio station at Agargaon in Dhaka yesterday
afternoon," sources said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, army sources disclosed that the army high command
has established full control over all military bases and started
an inquiry into the May 20 incident.
</P>
<P>
Nasim and a total of 7 other high-ranking officers have been
put under house arrest since the mutiny was foiled and all of them
have been shifted to the Dhaka cantonment, the sources said.

BANGKOK, May 24 (Xinhua) -- With investors buoyed by the news
that five Therd Thai faction minister and deputy ministers had
resigned, the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index Thursday
rebounded 18.81 points (1.49 percent) to 1,285.33.
</P>
<P>
Among the five, Deputy Interior Minister Suchart Tancharoen and
Deputy Finance Minister Newin Chidchob were among main targets
during the no-confidence grilling in parliament on May 8-10.
</P>
<P>
The opposition accused them of making personal gains through
shady deals to get bank loans to take over ailing listed
companies. Their deals have pushed the embattled Bangkok Bank of
Commerce (BBC) further to the verge of collapse.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister has taken over the ailing bank.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predicted that the SET index would remain steady,
fluctuating between 1,285 and 1,300 points, as investors wait for
more news about the future cabinet shake-up.
</P>
<P>
The three sectors that gained the most price-wise were textiles

<HEADLINE> Midwest China Needs Securities Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- Midwest China has been urged to
list more companies on stock exchanges to fuel economic growth.
</P>
<P>
And if China gets the third stock exchange that experts have
called for it should be sited in the central and west hinterland
to help create a Shanghai-type boom, a leading economist said.
</P>
<P>
"Only about 25 percent of our more than 9,000 incorporated
firms and a small proportion of the 360 or so listed companies are
in midwest China," noted Lu Yonghua, an expert with the State
Commission for Restructuring the Economy.
</P>
<P>
"Without benefiting from the securities market, it's hard for
midwest China to boost economy dramatically," Lu explained, "The
central government cannot pour large amounts of capital into those
regions, because of limited revenue sources."
</P>
<P>
"Midwest China should catch up with the coastal regions in
direct fund-raising by listing more companies on the two stock
exchanges," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Those companies play a remarkable role, which can hardly be
overestimated, in promoting economic growth, expanding those
regions' influence across the country and exposing them to the
world.
</P>
<P>
In developing the securities market and incorporated firms,
China should give top priority to the hinterland provinces and
autonomous regions, he said.
</P>
<P>
"If a third stock exchange is to be set up, it should be seated
in the central and west parts," he said, "so that securities
market there corresponds with the fact that these parts account
for 41 percent of the country's economic strength."
</P>
<P>
China's first two stock exchanges are in Shanghai, in east
China, and Shenzhen, a special economic zone in south China - both
booming, prosperous cities.
</P>
<P>
"And we should pay more attention to selecting more outstanding
enterprises with great potential in midwest China to issue new
shares," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lu emphasized that the central and west parts of the country
have better opportunities to develop and make use of the
securities market because China has shifted focus of long-term
economic strategy to those under-developed regions.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Put An End To US Garbage Export Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States and other
developed nations have been accused of treating China and the
developing world as dumping grounds for their waste.
</P>
<P>
Now the "threat of waste dumping" posed by the US to other
countries is no longer rare, according to a commentary, written by
Guo Jiju and carried by the "People's Daily" today.
</P>
<P>
A lot more "disgusting urban life waste" imported from the US
has been found in the cities of Qingdao and Shanghai, following
that discovered in Beijing, the commentary said, adding it is not
unusual for the US to export its waste to other nations and
regions.
</P>
<P>
According to a report, the commentary said, the US exports more
than 10 million tons of waste to developing nations every year,
and China and other Asian countries and regions have become the
main targets of the dumping.
</P>
<P>
It noted that exporting waste to other countries is 'an evil
act', which violates international treaties and obligations.
</P>
<P>
This has not only directly endangered the health of the people
in the developing countries, but also added unbearable economic
burdens to the countries who have to deal with the garbage, the
commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The US garbage has aroused fear and uneasy feelings among the
people in the developing nations who have continuously urged that
their countries should not be regarded or treated as dumping
grounds, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
It stated that some developed countries, the US in particular,
should not only keep clean themselves and put an end to the
exports of garbage to other countries, but should undertake more
obligations to contribute to solving the global environmental
problem and improving the environments of the developing nations.
</P>
<P>
However, the invasion of the US waste into developing countries
has not slowed down, the commentary said, asking why such a
"dignified" superpower as the US should allow disgusting waste to
be exported.
</P>
<P>
This has aroused condemnation among the developing countries,
including China, and all responsible and justice-loving nations
should strive to fight waste exporting, just the same as they
combat drug trafficking, in accordance with the Basel Convention
and other relevant international treaties.
</P>
<P>
The United States seems to be a country which pays great
attention to environmental issues and cites the issue as part of
its foreign policy and sometimes turns it into a political
issue. It even made irresponsible remarks and criticized some
developing nations for "their" environmental problems, But as a
matter of fact, those countries are the very victims of the US
waste, and what the US gets up to while peddling its
"environmental diplomacy".
</P>
<P>
The commentary urged the US government to take prompt effective
steps to eliminate the waste threat in a bid to show its genuine
sincerity for the global environment, especially the environmental
problem in the developing nations.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Congressional Panel Asks to Absolve President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- A Colombian
congressional panel recommended today that the congress absolve
Colombian President Ernesto Samper since there is no evidence that
Samper used drug money to win the presidential election in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Accusations Committee voted 10-3 today to recommend that
the congress clear Samper of charges that he personally approved
the use of 6 million U.S. dollars from the Cali cocaine cartel,
the biggest drug organization in the world, to help finance his
1994 election campaign.
</P>
<P>
In February, chief prosecutor Alfonso Valdivieso accused the
president of a cover-up of the use, illegal enrichment and
electoral fraud. But Samper has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing
and insisted that if any drug money entered his election bid, it
did so "behind my back."
</P>
<P>
The committee's recommendation will have to be voted on by
the House of Representatives in coming weeks.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Health Ministry has
devised special entry procedures for tourists arriving at Phuket
Airport from Malaysia to prevent the spread of cholera from
Penang, Malaysia, the Bangkok Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
Travelers suspected of being infected would be put in
quarantine, Virasith Raden, head of Phuket airport's communicable
diseases control checkpoint, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Everyone coming from Malaysia must fill in a form giving their
home address and address in Thailand, Virasith said.
</P>
<P>
Thai Airways and provincial hospitals have been asked to
cooperate by alerting the authorities if they found that a
traveler was infected, he said.
</P>
<P>
The airport toilets are being cleaned with antiseptic solution,
and samples of excrement from the toilets are being taken for
testing at a Bangkok hospital.
</P>
<P>
The Communicable Diseases Control Department had ordered
checkpoints in Sadao, Padang Besar, Takbai, Hatyai, Satun, Ranong
and Phuket to take precautionary measures.
</P>
<P>
The cholera outbreak reportedly started in Penang more than 10
days ago. It spread to nine other Malaysian states. A total of
1,089 people have been infected so far.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador to Invest $418 Million in Oil Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador will invest 418 million
dollars to modernize its oil industry, including the extension of
the Trans-Ecuadoran oil pipeline, the Energy Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The extended pipeline is expected to transport crude oil from
350,000 to 380,000 barrels a day. The project, to be financed by
the Ecuadoran State Oil Enterprise, will cost 100 million dollars,
said a document of the Energy Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline extension is a priority project for the Ecuadoran
government to increase the amount of crude oil being pumped from the
extraction zone in the jungle to the distribution center in the
coast.
</P>
<P>
The government is also studying several other projects of
construction of private oil pipelines.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of the Esmeraldas refinery will permit to boost
crude oil processing capacity from 90,000 to 110,000 barrels a day
and will cost 180 million dollars, of which 77 million dollars
have already been taken into account in the 1996 government budget.
</P>
<P>
The government will invest 2 million dollars to produce
unleaded gasoline this July to meet 60 percent of the national
demand.
</P>
<P>
Developing the natural gas with a total of 700 metric tons in
the Amazon region will cost 8 million dollars. This will save 72
million dollars a year for the country.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador produces 410,000 barrels of crude oil a day, of which
60 percent is exported to finance a third of the government
budget.

<HEADLINE> US Company Signs Another Gas Contract with Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- A US oil company, Atlantic Richfield
Co. (ARCO), has signed another contract with Myanmar's state oil
enterprise to jointly explore oil and natural gas at another block
in Myanmar's offshore area.
</P>
<P>
According to the production sharing contract signed here on
Thursday between the ARCO and Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise, the
two parties will jointly conduct the exploration and production at
Block No. M-7 in Myanmar's Mottama offshore area, the official
paper The New Light of Myanmar reported today.
</P>
<P>
The ARCO signed a similar contract in last July with Myanmar
for the exploration at Block No. M-9 and the present contract is
the second one.
</P>
<P>
Since Myanmar invited foreign oil companies for exploration and
development of its oil and gas in 1989, there have been 14 foreign
companies from seven countries -- France, the United States,
Britain, Australia, Japan, Thailand and Malaysia -- undertaking
petroleum exploration and production under over 20 production
sharing contracts with Myanmar in five offshore and seven onshore
areas. Foreign investment in oil and gas sector has reached 1.435
billion US dollars as of the end of March 1996.

<HEADLINE> Shanxi to Clean Fenhe River by Year 2005 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, May 24 (Xinhua) -- One of the country's industrial
centers and leading coal producers in north China has developed a
10-year plan to clean the Fenhe River by 2005.
</P>
<P>
According to the three-stage plan of the Shanxi provincial
government, the middle and lower reaches of the river should be
suitable for use in irrigation by 2000 and for sightseeing by
2005.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government is to allocate an additional 20
million yuan (2.4 million US dollars) each year to clean the river.
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1980s, the province earmarked 20 million yuan each
year to help projects in four counties curb water losses and soil
erosion on the upper reaches of the river and 30 million yuan for
air and water pollution controls.
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for 54 firms that are responsible for 80 percent
of the 350 million tons of industrial waste water and sewage
discharged into the river each year to bring their waste up to
national standards in a certain amount of time.
</P>
<P>
Coal producers have also been ordered to bring their discharge
of waste water in accord with environmental protection regulations
by the end of 1997. Some 860 coke ovens causing serious pollution
were demolished March 18-20 by a 300-member law enforcement task
force in Huozhou city.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, 20 coke ovens built by a Hongyun coking
plant with an investment of six million yuan in 1993, were also
demolished, and the plant plans to invest 50 million yuan in
setting up a more modern coking factory with a designed capacity
of 200,000 tons of coke annually.
</P>
<P>
Water treatment facilities will be built along the river in
major cities and towns, and new projects that pollute are banned
from the densely-populated river basin, which accounts for 41
percent of the province's population.
</P>
<P>
The basin produces 46 percent of the province's industrial
output and 64 percent of the province's agricultural output.

TEGUCIGALPA, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Honduran troops have cleared 70
square kilometers bordering Nicaragua of land mines, a legacy of
the war between the Sandinistas and U.S.-backed Contra guerrillas
in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the mine-clearing, funded and directed by

kilometers east of Tegucigalpa.
</P>
<P>
Many of Jamastran's 60,000 residents were maimed for life when
they stepped on the mines which were left behind by the Sandinista
Front for National Liberation (FSLN) and the Nicaraguan
Counter-revolutionary Army (the Contras) which fought a
low-intensity war in the area a decade ago.
</P>

<P>
KIEV, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Progress has been made in resolving
obstacles in relations between Russia and Ukraine, Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin was quoted as saying by local press today.
</P>
<P>
He was in Kiev for a one-day working visit and had talks with
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said that progress has been made over the division
of the Black Sea Fleet, the sole outstanding issue preventing the
signing of a friendship treaty.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have also made progress in negotiations over
Russian compensation to Ukraine for giving up tactical nuclear
weapons, which were part of the former Soviet arsenal, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the date of President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Ukraine,
which has been postponed six times in the past 20 months,
Chernomyrdin said that it may take place after the June 16
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma, describing as "fruitful" talks held earlier between
Chernomyrdin and Ukrainian Prime Minister Yevhen Marchuk, said
that more such consultations and dialogue were necessary to
promote bilateral relations.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia has officially presented its
application for full membership of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD), a government spokesman told
reporters here today.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Economy Yevgeny Yasin Wednesday handed over the
letter of application signed by Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin
to OECD Secretary-General Jean-Claude Paye in Paris, where the
organization is headquartered, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The OECD was established in 1961 and most of its 27 members are
Western industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
Participation in the OECD will promote economic reforms in
Russia, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, negotiations over Russia's admission will
probably take two or three years.
</P>
<P>
Russia was granted observer status in 24 OECD executive bodies
after it signed a cooperation agreement with the organization in
1994.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Astronomers Herald Upcoming Solar Eclipse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The last total solar eclipse of
this century will be visible in northernmost China's Mohe area
in March next year, Chinese astronomers announced.
</P>
<P>
The best time for watching the eclipse will be 9:08 to 9:11 am
(Beijing Time) on March 9, and the area of the shadow will be 370
km wide, they predicted.
</P>
<P>
"This will be the last chance for Chinese professional and
amateur sky watchers to observe a total solar eclipse on their
native soil," said Lin Yuanzhang, a research fellow at the Beijing
Observatory under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Total solar eclipses have been visible five times in China in
this century. The latest two were witnessed in northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in 1968 and southwest China's
Yunnan Province in 1980.
</P>
<P>
The one after next year's will occur in China probably in the
year 2008 or 2009, the astronomers predicted.
</P>
<P>
Lin said: "It will be the best time for us to research the
outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, which can be seen only
during a total solar eclipse."
</P>
<P>
Scientists will also research the impact on the Earth when the
sunlight suddenly disappears, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
Experts in popular science will also teach local people about
solar eclipses, which used to be regarded as omens of natural
disaster.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Budget Speech Kicks off National </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The budget delivered by New
Zealand Finance Minister Bill Birch Thursday is widely seen as a
political statement made by the government only months before the
coming general election scheduled for mid October.
</P>
<P>
Some opposition parties have angrily denounced the budget as an
election bribe, an accusation vigorously denied by Birch.
</P>
<P>
The budget has reaffirmed the government's priority to repay
public debt, but it does boost priority social spending on family
assistance, health care, education and environment, all being
areas vulnerable to opposition attacks and sensitive to the
general public.
</P>
<P>
Another sweet offered by the government is tax cuts, starting
from July 1 and to be followed by a new round of cuts next year.
</P>
<P>
But the expense for the government is lower operating surplus
and slower pace in debt repayment. The tax cuts and social
spending are expected to suck part of its surplus next year. The
budget announced a 2.8 billion NZ dollar (one NZ dollar equals
0.68 US dollars) surplus for 1996/97, down from 5.4 billion NZ
dollars projected last year.
</P>
<P>
Although debt repayment remains the government top priority,
the pace will slow down. The budget expects the debt will fall
from the present 32.4 percent of GDP to 19.4 percent by 1998/1999,
one year later than previously forecast.
</P>
<P>
The government still sticks to its prudent approach in
achieving budget surplus and rapid debt repayment. But the budget,
designed with the need of the election in mind, pushes "fiscal
prudence to the limits," as former finance minister Ruth
Richardson has put it.
</P>
<P>
Much of budget statement is devoted to listing the gains
achieved by the National Government since it came to power in
1990. It provides the National Party an opportunity to formally
kick off its election campaign. Among the gains Birch enumerated
are:
</P>
<P>
The economy is projected to grow at an annual average of 4.1
percent from mid 1993 to mid 1999;
</P>
<P>
Inflation has stayed at an average annual rate of 1.9 percent
since September 1991, compared with the yearly average rate of
12.3 percent in the 1975-1990 period;
</P>
<P>
Unemployment has fallen to around 6 percent from a peak of
nearly 11 percent in 1991;
</P>
<P>
Public debt has come down to 32 percent of GDP from 52 percent
in 1991/92;
</P>
<P>
The government has moved its accounts from persistent deficit
into large and sustainable surpluses, enabling it to increase
spending on health, education and tax relief.
</P>
<P>
Warning New Zealanders not to lose the gains, Birch said "all
our progress as a nation in the last painful but hugely achieving
decade is at stake on the next throw of the dice, in the 1996
general election."
</P>
<P>
These remarks sound like a clear invitation to the voters:
"Vote again for the National Party."

<HEADLINE> European Soccer Chief Calls for Joint Asian World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 23 (Xinhua) -- European football chief Lennart
Johansson said here on Thursday a decision on whether South Korea
and Japan should co-host the 2002 World Cup might be made next
week.
</P>
<P>
According to a press reports here, FIFA's 21-man executive
committee will meet in Zurich to choose the 2002 hosts on June 1,
but Johansson said the eight European members would ask for a
decision on co-hosting on May 31.
</P>
<P>
"The experts who went to inspect both countries found they were
on the same level. As we can't choose by heads or tails we must
find a compromise," the UEFA president added.
</P>
<P>
"We already made a mistake by picking two candidates from the
same confederation."
</P>
<P>
UEFA's executive committee has already called on FIFA president
Joao Havelange to consider co-hosting.
</P>
<P>
But FIFA, which has not published the findings of its
inspection of sites carried out in November, has ruled out a joint
venture.
</P>
<P>
'Co-hosting is not a feasible idea. The situation is not
possible as in our constitution if there are two or more
candidates who can stage the World Cup they should be in
competition until there is a winner," FIFA general secretary Sepp
Blatter has said.
</P>
<P>
"We see no problem with having two candidates from Asia."

<HEADLINE> Voters' Registration for Bosnian Elections Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Registration of voters for
parliamentary elections in Bosnia is set to begin on June 8 and to
be completed by July 19, an OSCE official said today.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Miglierina, spokesman for the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Banja Luka office, told a press
briefing in the Serb industrial city that the registration of
political parties began on May 7 and should end by June 7, both in
the Serb state Republika Srpska and in the Muslim-Croat
Federation.
</P>
<P>
OSCE is responsible for the organization and monitoring of the
elections in the war-ravaged Bosnia. Elections was scheduled for
September under the Dayton Peace Implementation Force (IFOR).
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said today in Banja Luka that all three sides had
recalled troops and armament to barracks to pave the way for the
general elections, the first since Bosnia declared independence
from the former Yugoslavia in early 1992
</P>
<P>
"This has made it possible for IFOR to turn to non-military
jobs - repairing roads, water supply system and other facilities,"
Tanjug news agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
International police spokesman Alan Roberts also said that all
checkpoints in Bosnia had been dismantled and that new ones could
be set up only with the consent of the international police.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Official Says Arrest Warrants May Be Issued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 23 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. spokesperson said here
today international arrest warrants would be issued against
Bosnian Serb leaders indicted by the war crimes tribunal if there
were enough evidences.
</P>
<P>
Serb President Radovan Karadzic and Serb Army commander General
Ratko Mladic have been indicted by the Hague-based international
war crimes tribunal on charges of committing war crimes during the
Bosnian civil war.
</P>
<P>
"If evidence supports allegations in the indictments," then
arrest warrants would be issued to get them arrested, U.N.
spokeswoman in Belgrade Susan Manuel told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
She added that prosecution at the Hague tribunal would start
presenting evidence against the two Serb leaders on May 27.
</P>
<P>
"Tribunal President Antonio Cassese has addressed a letter to
the U.N. Security Council which contains facts so as to exert
pressure and obtain the arrest of Karadzic and Mladic," Manuel
said.
</P>
<P>
International pressure has been mounting recently to force the
two indicted Serb leaders to step down and be extradited to the
Hague for trial. Karadzic and Mladic remain in top posts although
they should have stepped down under the Dayton peace agreement
signed late last year.
</P>
<P>
54 people have been indicted by the international war crimes
tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, of whom 47 are Serbs and the
rest are Croats and Muslims.

<HEADLINE> Muslims, Croats Agree To Delay Mostar Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, May 23 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Muslims and Croats have
agreed to delay the controversial elections in Mostar, it was
learned on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was announced in Sarajevo by an international
mediator Michael Steiner and confirmed later by Kresimir Zubak,
President of Bosnia's Muslim-Croat Federation.
</P>
<P>
Zubak also said that the agreement could be signed by Muslim
and Croat representatives on Saturday, but European Administrator
to Mostar Ricardo Perez Casado would choose a new date no later
than the end of next month for the elections which was originally
scheduled for May 31.
</P>
<P>
The delay stemmed from complaints by the Muslim side that the
election rules exclude refugees unable to return on the election
day from the Mostar elections. All major Muslim parties threatened
to boycott the elections unless the rules were changed.
</P>
<P>
Zubak said that the two sides have also agreed on the
modalities of voting by refugees, under which all Mostar citizens
now living abroad will be given a chance to come to Mostar on
election day and return safely to countries in which they have the
status of refugees.
</P>
<P>
For those who do not wish to or can not come, voting will be
organized at special offices abroad to be established by the
European Union, instead of at Bosnian embassies as Muslim side
proposed, Zubak said.
</P>
<P>
The voting in these offices will be supervised by
representatives of the European Union and Croats and Muslims, to
ensure full regularity of the elections, he said.
