<HEADLINE> Cyprus Amends Policy on Registration of Ships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus government has decided
to amend its policy on the registration of ships in the Cyprus
Register of Ships in an effort to improve the safety record of
Cyprus fleet and its image.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus News Agency reported on Tuesday that one of the
highlights of the new policy, which will enter into force on
January 1, 2000, is the reduction of the age of ships which may be
registered in the Cyprus Register of Ships from 17 to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
All Cyprus-flagged fishing vessels will be required to obtain a
fishing license from the Fisheries Department of the Republic of
Cyprus, irrespective of whether they fish in or outside the
territorial waters of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
For vessels already registered in the Cyprus Register of
Ships, which fish outside Cyprus' territorial waters, the
provision will come into effect later in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus government has also introduced a new taxation regime for
ship management services.
</P>
<P>
Notwithstanding the provisions of the income tax laws in
force, no tax is levied on the income derived by an person from
rendering of ship management services for the period ending
December 31, 2020.
</P>
<P>
"Instead, a special tax is levied on the basis of the tonnage
of ships from which ship management services have been rendered,"
the report said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June 1999 the Cypriot merchant fleet ranked
sixth in the world with 2,667 ships of a gross tonnage exceeding
26.4 million.
</P>
<P>
Almost 70 percent of Cyprus-flagged vessels checked by Cyprus'
Department of Merchant Shipping in the third quarter of this year
were deficient.

<HEADLINE> Barak Promises to Freeze Settlement Expansions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said here Tuesday that he will freeze plans to build 1,800
more houses in Jewish settlements in the West Bank in order to
push the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks forward.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference after holding talks with visiting
Polish Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek, Barak said building more houses
in the settlements will hinder Israel's efforts to strike a final
peace accord with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"The government already approved 1,800 apartments, mostly in
large settlement blocs near Jerusalem," Barak said, adding that
"I think that at this time, in the next few months when we are
deep in negotiations with the Palestinians on a final peace
treaty, there is no point and to a certain extent it interferes
with Israel's peace efforts to begin something that will not be
finished before the negotiations end."
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo announced on
Monday after holding talks with his Israeli counterpart Obed Eran
that he would not negotiate on any issue until Israel stops
expanding Jewish settlements on occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
Barak expressed confidence that the crisis would pass in a
matter of days and he had no doubt that the negotiations will
continue.
</P>
<P>
Buzek arrived here Tuesday for a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Buzek, who is reciprocating a visit by former Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Poland two years ago, also
discussed with Barak economic cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Buzek will also travel to the Palestinian self-rule territories
to hold talks with Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
To welcome the Polish prime minister's visit to Israel,
Interior Minister Natan Sharansky announced on Monday that Israel
will allow Polish tourists to enter Israel without a visa.

HARARE, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe Tuesday held talks on a wide range of issues with a U.S.
delegation led by Richard Gephardt, Democratic Party leader in the
U.S. House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
The 13-member delegation which arrived in the country in the
afternoon met Mugabe at the State House in Harare.
</P>
<P>
Gephardt told reporters after the talks that they had discussed
health, education, economics and the relationship between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said another issue of discussion was the conflict in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The U.S. parliamentarian said that Mugabe had given them an

</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has recently pledged to spend one million
U.S. dollars to help the Joint Military Commission to end the war

<HEADLINE> November Car Registrations In UK Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- New car registrations in Britain
fell by 5.9 percent in November to 143,323 units, according to
industry figures released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This pushed the year-to-date total past the 2 million mark, at
2,113,033 units -- 1.8 percent below last year's level, show the
figures by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT)
</P>
<P>
As expected, the new car market has begun to slow. Demand in
the final quarter of this year is weakening, and is expected to
meet the year-end forecast of 2.2 million units.
</P>
<P>
Economists in the sector believe the impact of model
changeovers, millennium spending and the expected strong demand
for a year 2000 car may also be affecting demand in the final
quarter.
</P>
<P>
However, Al Clarke, SMMT spokesman, said, "There is no evidence
that the market is in decline or that there is a lack of any
confidence."

MOSCOW, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Moldovan parliament Tuesday
passed a non-confidence motion against the newly formed government
headed by Communist Party leader Vladimir Voronin.
</P>
<P>
Only 48 deputies voted their confidence in the government
proposed by the newly nominated Prime Minister Voronin, while 52
supporters are required by law to pass the vote.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time that the Moldovan parliament voted

</P>
<P>
According to the country's constitution, the president can
dissolve parliament if it fails to vote confidence in the
government twice within 45 days
</P>
<P>
Thus Moldovan President Petru Lucinschi now may dismiss the
parliament and the month-long government crisis has heated up.
</P>
<P>
The president's press service said Lucinschi will decide in the
next 24 hours whether to call earlier elections or to propose a
third candidate for premier.

<HEADLINE> Production to Be Resumed in Northern Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Agricultural and industrial
production as well as the telegraphic web in northern Angola are
expected to be resumed soon as the local governments are engaging
themselves in rehabilitating the necessary infrastructures,
official source said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Industrial Association of Angola (AIA) and the Angolan National
 Institute of Cafe (INCA) will help implement joint agricultural
projects and create micro-industrial enterprises in the northern
Angolan province of Uige.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the two organizations are concentrating their
energy on the rehabilitation of the agricultural producers'
cooperatives destroyed by the 25-year-long civil conflict between
the government troops and the rebel National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The agricultural cooperative in the Village of Sange, located
four kilometers away from the provincial capital Uige, will first
benefit from the project, which plans to help the village
rehabilitate its agricultural infrastructures in early 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to AIA officials, the organizations will expand the
rehabilitation of the destructed infrastructures to other cities
in the province.
</P>
<P>
AIA and INCA will collaborate with local governments in
creating working conditions for the rural youth by erecting
generator groups in the region to provide electric power.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the telegraphic web connecting the Uige Province
with the national capital Luanda was inaugurated on Tuesday, with
the total cost estimated at 230,000 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Israeli National Airlines to Buy Boeing Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli national carrier El
Al Tuesday signed a contract for the purchase of three Boeing 777
long-range planes from the Seattle-based Boeing company, Israel
Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
An El Al spokesman said the new Boeing 777 acquisitions, which
cost the airlines about 400 million U.S. dollars, will replace
those aging ones serving duty now and provide better service for
the passengers. The new Boeing 777s' delivery will begin in
February 2001.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also confirmed that the planned approval of the
purchase of Airbus planes had been postponed, after Transport
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said he needed more time to revalue the
financing plan for the purchase and to consult with the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
El Al should present its purchase plans to the ministries
concerned for approval because Israeli government owns it.
</P>
<P>
In October, the airlines' board approved the purchase of three
Boeing jets and made a controversial decision to consider buying
four mid-range Airbus 330s at a cost of 300 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
It was supposed to put a final stamp of approval of the A330s
in mid-November, but the vote had been repeatedly postponed
allegedly because of the pressure from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Some Boeing officials reportedly objected the Airbus purchase
for fear that if approved, it will end El Al's exclusive reliance
on American aircraft and probably lead to additional sales of the
European consortium in the future.

ATHENS, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Greece Tuesday welcomed as a
positive step the statement made by Turkish Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem that Turkey would fall into line with the rules of the

Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman

</P>
<P>
It was imperative for the neighboring country to proceed to

With the nearing of the EU summit in Helsinki next week, Greece

For decades, Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have been at
odds over their disputes in the territorial waters, air space
limits and the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean
Sea and the Cyprus problem.

Greece has warned in recent days that it will veto Turkey's EU
candidacy at the Helsinki summit if the EU cannot guarantee Cyprus
' unhindered EU accession and Greece's sovereign rights in eastern
Aegean not being questioned by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
While urging Turkey to made some goodwill gestures, Greece has
also called on its neighbor to respect the EU rules such as the

OTTAWA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Canada's overseas development
assistance has dropped to a 30-year low, the Ottawa Citizen
newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the country's non-governmental organizations
(NGOs) as saying that Canada ranks 11th in overseas development
assistance as a percentage of GNP, down from its seventh place in
the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The report said that only Finland has cut deeper into its
development assistance among the 21 donor nations of the
Organization for European Cooperation and Development (OECD).
</P>
<P>
International assistance does not keep pace with Canada's
growing wealth and will result in further slippage in the overseas
development-GNP ratio, the report warned.
</P>
<P>
Canada spends about 2 billion Canadian dollars (about 1.4
billion U.S. dollars) annually on overseas assistance. The country
plans to boost spending next year by 50 million Canadian dollars (

<P>
CAIRO, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Tuesday criticized
Israel for failing to stop settlement expansion on the occupied
Palestinian territories and called on the Jewish state to freeze
the activities immediately.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before leaving for Germany on a visit,
President Hosni Mubarak's political advisor Osama el-Baz said the
Mideast region is "in dire need of continuation of the peace
process."
</P>
<P>
But Israel's settlement activities, in particular, have
poisoned the regional peace atmosphere and overshadowed its
credibility, especially "at the current sensitive and critical
stage" of the Palestinian-Israeli final-status talks, el-Baz said.
</P>
<P>
The activities also will ruin the peace process "while we are
in severe need to keep a suitable atmosphere to help propel the
peace march," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The presidential advisor called on Israel to refrain from
adopting measures and policies that will impede the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has been criticized for
approving settlement expansion in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
since taking office in July even at a quicker pace than his
hardline predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians were frustrated by the continuation of
Israel's settlement activities and announced on Monday that they
would not proceed with the final-status talks before Israel calls
a stop.

donated 50 million and 28 million U.S. dollars respectively to a
global campaign to eradicate polio by the end of year 2000.
</P>

The Gates/Turner donations will help vaccinate millions of

<P>
These grants will primarily be used to strengthen the vaccine
delivery infrastructure and to track the remaining pockets of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Gates and Turner were quoted by WHO as encouraging the private
and public sectors to match these gifts to ensure the next step of
delivering the actual polio vaccine to children in developing
nations is realized.
</P>
<P>
"We are on track to eradicate polio," said WHO Director-General
Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland. "One of the biggest challenges we now
face is raising the necessary funds to finish the job on time."
</P>
<P>
"With this kind of contribution, a polio-free world is within
reach and one of the world's largest health initiatives can be
brought to a successful conclusion," she said. "I would like to
thank Bill and Melinda Gates as well as Ted Turner's United

refugees and water.
</P>
<P>
Washington opposes Israel's settlement policy as it complicates
the underway talks, said Rubin.
</P>
<P>
The United States voiced frequently its concern over the
Israeli settlement activities which posed "a great problem" to
the peace process, he said, adding the only way to solve that
problem is dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he noted that the U.S. has come up with some
suggestions on the resumption of the Syrian-Israeli talks, which
have been stalled since February 1996. To revive the talks is
difficult and needs serious decisions from both Syria and Israel,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman underlined that the United States tried to reach
an equation that meets the desires of both sides in the main
points such as Israeli pullout from Syria's Golan Heights, peace
concept, security arrangements and a time-table for the
implementation of the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The United States works not only for the resumption of the
talks, but also for finding speedy solutions to the problems,
Rubin added.
</P>
<P>
On the Iraqi issue, the U.S. official said that Washington
might use force against Iraq if it poses any threat to its
neighbors, launches offensives against the Kurds or tries to
develop weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
As for Albright's visit to Saudi Arabia, Rubin said that
Albright had a 30-minute meeting with Saudi King Fahd and a
one-hour meeting with Crown Prince Abdullah Bin Abdul-Aziz on the
tracks of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The meetings also dealt with Saudi Arabia's endeavor to join
the World Trade Organization (WTO) and Albright extended
Washington's backing for the Saudi aspiration, he added.
</P>
<P>
The United States is strongly backing WTO orientation and
supports Saudi Arabia's policy to liberalize its trade systems,
said Rubin.
</P>
<P>
He expressed satisfaction with Saudi Arabia's assistance to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Albright left here for Damascus Tuesday afternoon for a one-day
visit to Syria.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Teachers Strike for Higher Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Some 60,000 Lebanese primary
education teachers from both private and public schools Tuesday
staged a one-day strike to press the government to meet their
salary demands.
</P>
<P>
Aida Khatib, head of Beirut's League for Public Primary and
Intermediary School Teachers, told reporters that this is just a
warning strike which will be followed by more serious steps if the
government still ignores their demands for higher pay.
</P>
<P>
The teachers are demanding a 35 percent salary increase for
primary and intermediary instructors to match the rise given to
both public and private secondary school teachers earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
In October, private school teachers staged a two-day strike to
press for action on the same demands, which will cost the
cash-strapped government 400 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese government has reportedly said that it lacks the
money to fund the salary hike.
</P>
<P>
The strike has left more than 750,000 students at home for the
day, said a striking teacher.

<P>
Canadian Prime Minister has ordered eight key cabinet ministers
to be in Ottawa to ensure smooth transition into the new

according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Officials, however, made it clear that they "don't respond to

</P>
<P>
The federal government has declared 99 percent ready for the
new year as a result of intensive research at 2.5 billion Canadian

</P>
<P>
The year 2000 bug was born in the 1960s, when computer

Consequently, 99 would represent the year 1999, while 00 would

<P>
ABU DHABI, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Arab League
Secretary-General Dr. Esmat Abdel-Meguid on Tuesday called for
reconciliation among Arab states, stressing coordination and
cooperation in dealing with international and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
"We consider reconciliation as the only way out of the current
situation and we have to coordinate our stances so as to deal
carefully with the present problems and challenges," said the head
of the Cairo-based pan-Arab organization.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the official WAM news agency, Meguid, who
arrived here earlier in the day on a visit to the United Arab
Emirates (UAE), added that the league's council would discuss at
its next meeting in March draft laws for setting up the Arab Court
of Justice and other mechanism for settling disputes among Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
Meguid earlier held talks with UAE Foreign Minister Rashid
Abdullah al-Nuaimi and Minister of Information and Culture Sheikh
Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan.

They exchanged views on the latest development on the Arab
arena and issues of mutual concern, WAM said, without

AMMAN, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Several members of Jordanian
first-division side Al Wihdat were injured when they were attacked
by unidentified assailants, who ambushed the team bus as it
returned after losing the league finale, a local newspaper said on

The Al Arab Al Youm daily noted that the bus was forced to stop

stones at the vehicle. The attackers armed with sticks then
boarded the bus and hit the players as they tried to hide under
the seats.
</P>
<P>
It said one player was knocked unconscious and hospitalized and
two others were admitted for observation. The rest were treated
for minor injuries and discharged.

<HEADLINE> No Palestinian Prisoners to be Released Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Israel can not release more
Palestinian prisoners before the Muslim holy month of Ramadan as
the two sides failed to agree on the list of prisoners to be
freed, Israel Radio reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted Israeli security sources as saying that
Israeli and Palestinian officials have met for several times
recently on the issue, but no agreement was reached on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side insisted that the next release be done
according to the list submitted by the Palestinian side, a request
rejected by Israel on grounds that some prisoners the Palestinians
asked for can not go due to security reasons, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Considering Israel's security, the list of the prisoners slated
for release can only be decided by Israel, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
As part of the Sharm el Sheikh peace deal sighed on September
5, Israel released 350 Palestinian prisoners on September 9 and
October 15.
</P>
<P>
As a gesture of goodwill, Israel has agreed to release another
batch of Palestinian prisoners before Ramadan which starts
Wednesday, in order to let the prisoners spend the holy month with
their families.
</P>
<P>
But the release has been stalled along with ill-fated the
final-status talks which hit an impasse Monday due to Israel's
settlements expansion in the West Bank.

KATHMANDU, December 7 (Xinhua) -- A special session of
parliament will be called on December 14 to discuss the recent
increase in the prices of various goods and services in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition party the Communist Party of Nepal-United
Marxist and Leninist (CPN-UML) made a submission to King Birendra
Tuesday to request a special session.
</P>
<P>
King Birendra ratified the submission, which was signed by 60
CPN-UML MPs.
</P>
<P>
CPN-UML said in the submission that at a time when people are
bearing the brunt of the recent hikes in the prices of diesel,
kerosene, chemical fertilizers and electricity, the government is
again considering an increase in drinking water and telephone
without being sensitive to the problems of the people.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it is imperative on the part of the House of
Representatives to discuss this issue and reach a conclusion, the
submission said.
</P>
<P>
Although the Nepali government raised in October the prices of
diesel by 48 percent, kerosene by 23 percent and electricity by an
average of 30 percent, it is planning to hike the prices of some
other essential commodities.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's parliament Tuesday
withdrawed parliamentary immunity of a deputy who was accused of
embezzling public funds.
</P>
<P>
The 128-member parliament approved with an overwhelming
majority to strip Habib Hakim of his immunity.
</P>
<P>
Hakim was the first legislator in Lebanon's recent history
whose immunity was taken away because of corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
In July, State Prosecutor General Adnan Addoum urged
parliament to lift Hakim's immunity to pave the way for
questioning him and others on embezzlement charges.
</P>
<P>
The voting on Hakim's immunity was delayed by some deputies
who asked the judicial authorities to present more details about
the case.
</P>
<P>
Hakim was accused of concluding a contract with Italian firm
Danico when he was chairman of the Union of Metn Municipalities to
build a garbage incinerator that was reportedly never materialized.
</P>
<P>
Hakim is one of the officials in former Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri's administration who have been accused of abusing power
while in office.
</P>
<P>
Hariri's supporters claimed that the current regime is carrying
out a political revenge.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 18 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Foreign Minister Joao
Miranda received here on Thursday the Cote d'Ivoire Ambassador to
Angola and criticized the country of continuing its support for
the Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi and his followers,
according to official source.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting with the foreign minister, the Cote d'Ivoire
Ambassador declared sadly that despite the respect and friendship
with the press, he would not make any declaration.
</P>
<P>
But an official source asking for anonymity said that during
the meeting, Joao Miranda has "seriously criticized" the diplomat
for the "dubious" comportment of the Cote d'Ivoire government on
the issue of providing Savimbi and his followers with passports.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the sanctions imposed by the United Nations against
the Angolan rebels, the Cote d'Ivoire government continued to
permit the rebels to use the passport issued by its official
institution.
</P>
<P>
In early 1999, the Cote d'Ivoire government has announce to
confiscate and declare invalid all the Ivoirese passports held by
members of the rebel National Union for Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) and their families.
</P>
<P>
But the surrender of Araujo Sakaita, one of the 28 offsprings of
Savimbi, to the government, revealed a fact that relatives of
Savimbi are still using the Cote d'Ivoire passports.
</P>
<P>
It is also reported that the Angolan government has had
evidence that Isaias Samakuva, representative of UNITA in France,
also holds the Cote d' Ivoire passport.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Productivity Grows in Third Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Productivity grew at a 4.9 percent annual rate from July
through September of this year, the department reported.
</P>
<P>
It was revised upward from a previous estimate of 4.2 percent,
to reflect an even bigger rebound from the second quarter, when
productivity growth had slowed to 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, unit labor costs, considered a key measure of wage
pressures that can lead to inflation, dropped at a 0.2 percent
annual rate in the third quarter, the biggest decline since the
spring of 1997. A previous estimate had third-quarter labor costs
rising slightly, by 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's report was good news for investors wary of signs of
inflation that could trigger further interest rate increases from
the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed), analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has said that the nation's central
bankers are staying alert for any slowdown in productivity as a
possible early warning of inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Fed has already raised interest rates three times this year
to try to prevent inflation as the economy continues its longest
expansion in peacetime history.
</P>
<P>
The third-quarter rise in productivity was the biggest since
the last quarter of 1992, when productivity jumped at a 7.4
percent annual rate. It followed a small 0.6 percent gain in the
second quarter and a 2.7 percent gain in the first quarter of this
year.
</P>
<P>
The slight drop in unit labor costs from July through September
of this year followed a 4.2 percent rise in the second quarter and
a 1.4 percent increase in the first.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Greece's year-on-year inflation
rose from 2.2 percent in October to 2.6 percent in November, the
National Statistics Service (NSS) announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The NSS attributed the rise to the increase in the cost of
heating fuel and petrol.
</P>
<P>
The NSS said that Greece's inflation would remain at the same
level in December.
</P>
<P>
The continuing increase in the price of petrol would be offset
by rate cuts being introduced by the Public Power Corporation and
the Hellenic Telecommunications Organization.
</P>
<P>
Greece is the only European Union (EU) member excluded from the
launch of the euro currency on January 1 because it did not meet
the conditions for membership.
</P>
<P>
Greece now aims to join the European Economic and Monetary
union (EMU) on January 1, 2001 and the inflation, which is the
only obstacle for the country to qualify itself for the EMU, must
be brought and sustained at 2.0 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- British Conservative MPs Tuesday
condemned moves by European Union internal market ministers to
impose a levy on art dealers across the UK.
</P>
<P>
News that Denmark may switch sides and now support EU plans to
impose a levy on art sales means that the blocking minority of
Austria, Britain, the Netherlands, Ireland and Luxembourg looks
unlikely to be able to resist EU pressure.
</P>
<P>
Tory Euro-MPs have fought this latest Euro-rule for the past
four years. Conservative culture spokesman Roy Perry warned, "
London is second only to New York in the resale of works of art.
This Brussels blow will hit over 8,500 people and cut the value of
Britain's art market by over 700 million pounds a year."
</P>
<P>
Perry said this is an absurd example of Brussels interference.
"The imposition of a sliding scale of levies will force the
relocation of businesses and thousands of jobs across the Atlantic.
"
</P>
<P>
"Today sees the auction of thousands of British jobs as EU
ministers in Brussels sign away another part of EU competitiveness,
" Perry added.

with his Ugandan counterpart Yoweri Museveni in a bid to improve
the bilateral relations between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Museveni is due to arrive in Nairobi Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The talks have been arranged by a foundation headed by former
U.S. President Jimmy Carter and facilitated by Kenyan President
Daniel arap Moi. Carter is due to arrive in Kenya later Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Uganda and Sudan have been tense for
years, with each side pointing the finger at the other.
</P>
<P>
Uganda alleges that Sudan provides arms and sanctuary to the
Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), which operates from southern Sudan
and frequently carries out raids in northern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Sudan asserts that Uganda supports the Sudan People's
Liberation Army (SPLA) which has been fighting for autonomy in
southern Sudan since 1983.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Teenagers Who Drink Or Use Drugs More Likely to Have Sex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. study released here
Tuesday found teenagers with drinking or drug use habit are much
more likely to have sex at a younger age and with more partners
than nonusers of the same age group.
</P>
<P>
Teens who are 14 and younger and drink are twice as likely to
have sex than those who don't in the same age group, said the
report from the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at
Columbia University. The risks doubled for 14-year-olds who use
drugs.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, older teens who drink are seven times
as likely to have intercourse than nondrinking teens, and are
twice as likely to have it with four or more partners.
</P>
<P>
Drug-using older teens are five times as likely to have sex
than nonusers, and three times as likely to have it with four or
more partners.
</P>
<P>
All in all, 63 percent on teenagers who use alcohol have had
sex, compared with 26 percent of teens who don't drink. About 72
percent of teens who use drugs have had sex compared with 36
percent who don't use drugs.
</P>
<P>
The study, based on national data of more than 34,000 teenagers
in U.S., also found that young people in general have more sex
today than 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
In a study from 1970, less than 5 percent of the 15-year-old
girls questioned had engaged in sex. In 1972 the number for boys
the same age was 20 percent. In 1997, said the study, 38 percent
of the 15-year-old girls and 45 percent of the 15-year-old boys
had had sex.

<HEADLINE> China Not A Paradise, EU Lawmakers Told </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS December 7 (Xinhua) -- China is not a paradise, which
belongs to the world of the faultless and impeccable God, and not
everything is perfect in China, Song Mingjiang, Chinese Ambassador
to the European Communities, told a meeting of the European
Parliament Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting of European Parliament delegation for
relations with China, Mr. Song said there are two views on China
in some international media, both of which are a far cry from the
realities in China.
</P>
<P>
"Either China's rise is regarded as a threat to the world, or
China is said to be in a mess. The former tends to vilify and
demolish China; the latter tries to exaggerate and play up the
existing problems and difficulties encountered by China in the
process of its development, as if China were on the brink of
collapse," he told the European Union (EU)'s lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
Anyone who has been to China and seen the country with his own
eyes will conclude that neither of the views is true to the real
situation in China, he said, citing some facts in supporting his
argument.
</P>
<P>
"The point here is that China is developing and making progress.
Such development and progress are good for China and good for the
world. China has been and will remain an important factor working
for peace, stability and prosperity of the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Song also quoted Samuel Berger, Assistant to the U.S.
President for National Security Affairs, as saying that anyone
should not look at China through rose colored glasses, and neither
should anyone see it through a glass darkly, distorting its
strength and ignoring its complexities. "I think Mr. Berger's
point is objective and fair," he added.
</P>
<P>
Also Chinese Ambassador to Belgium, Mr. Song said China still
faces problems and difficulties on its way forward. "The impact of
the Asian financial crisis continues to be felt; the deep-rooted
contradictions and problems that have emerged in reform must be
dealt with urgently; the need of economic restructuring and
industrial rationalization is pressing; market demand and
consumption are still weak; export is facing considerable pressure;
and the task of redirecting surplus employees of state-owned
companies to other lines of business is heavy," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the face of these problems and difficulties, the Chinese
government has formulated corresponding measures and these
measures are being implementing earnestly," the Chinese ambassador
added.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Whisky to be Standardized for More Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government is
proposing new rules to make a local drink called Rye a standard
Canadian whisky for more exports.
</P>
<P>
Health Canada plans to amend the definition of Rye to ensure
that the product will be made entirely in Canada and contain at
least 40 percent of alcohol by volume, the Globe and Mail said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Canadian distillers, including Seagram Co. Ltd. and Hiram
Walker &AMP;Sons Ltd., have been pushing for these changes to open up
new markets, particularly the European Union market, according to
the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, the product should be aged a minimum three
years in Canada.
</P>
<P>
Annually, Canada exports about 550 million Canadian dollars(
about 373 million U.S. dollars) in Rye and the country aims its
export goal at a yearly 1 billion Canadian dollars (about 678
million U.S. dollars) within five years.

<HEADLINE> Israel Appointed Coordinator for Talks With Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 7 (Xinhua) - Uri Saguy, a former head of
Israeli Military Intelligence, has been appointed coordinator of
future peace talks with Syria, reliable sources said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Saguy, a close aide to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, will
be directly subordinate to Barak, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
There are stubborn rumors recently that Saguy had begun secret
contacts with representatives of Syrian President Hafez al Assad.
</P>
<P>
Saguy was named hours before a visit to Israel by U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who said she was
optimistic about the resumption of Syrian-Israeli peace talks
after a lengthy meeting with Assad in Damascus earlier Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Albright is due to hold talks with Israeli leaders to revive
talks with Syria, which broke down three years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, a statement released by Israeli Foreign Ministry late
Tuesday night said the planned talks between Albright and Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy has been postponed to Wednesday
morning due to late of her flight.
</P>
<P>
Albright started her Mideast tour in Saudi Arabia Monday and
she is due in Israel Tuesday evening after a stopover in
Syria. She will also visit Palestinian self-rule areas and Egypt
to give the inactive Middle East peace process a push.

<HEADLINE> World Bank: Recovery in Developing World to Accelerate But Fragile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Despite a faster than
expected global recovery, the lingering effects of the global
financial crisis continue to depress output across developing
countries, and hamper efforts to reduce poverty worldwide,
according to a new report released by the World Bank on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Global Economic Prospects and the Developing Countries 2000,
the World Bank's yearly report on prospects for developing
countries, argued that recovery from the financial crisis is "
fragile and uneven," with some regions recovering much faster than
others.
</P>
<P>
The report projected the economic growth in developing
countries to grow by 2.7 percent in 1999, and accelerate to 4.2
percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Growth will be strong in Asia this year and next as the crisis
countries recover from the depths of recession, but it will remain
well below historical averages, despite a continued robust
performance in China and India, the report said. Outside Asia,
average per capita income in developing countries will actually
decline in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The report said that as the effects of the crisis recede,
growth in developing countries, excluding the transition economies,
is projected to average 5 percent a year in 2002-2008, a much
faster rate of growth than in industrial countries. Nonetheless,
this will be significantly lower than developing countries
achieved during the pre-crisis 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The lower growth projection reflects assumptions that capital
flows will take time to recover and that they will remain volatile,
and that commodity prices are unlikely to stage a strong recovery
from their recent historic lows. In addition, the crisis has
uncovered, and in some cases accentuated, serious structural
weaknesses in developing countries, particularly in financial
systems and government accounts, that will take considerable time
to resolve. These weaknesses leave developing countries exposed to
renewed bouts of volatility.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, Global Economic Prospects presented
forecasts for poverty reduction in developing countries. It
concluded that in many developing countries, progress in the fight
against poverty is likely to fall short of the goal set by the
international community, which calls for poverty to be reduced by
half by 2015.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the crisis increased poverty in 1998 in
East Asian Crisis countries and Russia, which, in turn, has
stalled the progress of the early 1990s in reducing poverty
worldwide. Urban poverty increased in all East Asian crisis
countries in 1998. For example, in Korea, poverty among its urban
population more than doubled, from 9 percent in 1997 to 19 percent
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Despite the cyclical recovery in East Asia, serious structural
problems remain. The value of non-performing loans range from
approximately 30 percent of gross domestic product in South Korea
and Malaysia to 60 percent for Thailand, well above the experience
of most earlier crises. Moreover, non-performing loans continue to
rise as further problems are revealed, and weak firms add to their
problems by borrowing new money to make interest payments on their
existing debt.
</P>
<P>
Without vigorous corporate and financial restructuring,
sustainable growth will take longer to return, the costs of the
crisis are likely to rise, and economies will remain vulnerable to
new external and internal shocks, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Albright Arrives in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright arrived in Israel Tuesday evening from Damascus
to continue her current Middle East tour.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials earlier described Albright's trip to the region
as a listen-and-learn mission, but the fast development in the
Middle East peace process will not let her to do so.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks broke
down, while the two sides faced another stalemate in overcoming
their disputes over Israel's next troop redeployment in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo announced on
Monday in Ramallah after holding talks with his Israeli
counterpart Oded Eran that the Palestinian side will not proceed
with further final-status talks with Israelis until the Israeli
government stops Jewish settlement expansion activities in the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side was angered by the Israeli Housing
Ministry's new tenders for building another 500 houses for
settlers, saying such steps taken by the Israeli government was
aimed at destroying the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
This is Albright's first trip to the region since September,
when she mediated Israel and Palestine to sign the Sharm el Sheikh
peace deal, which asks the two sides to reach a framework
agreement on final-status by next February and a final peace
agreement by September the same year.
</P>
<P>
With the February deadline for a framework agreement rapidly
approaching, this time Albright has not only to focus her
attention on the final-status talks, but also to devote at least
part of her time on helping Israeli and Palestinian sides to
solve the dispute over Israel's next handover of another 5
percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
She is scheduled to hold talks with Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Wednesday,
before flying to Cairo.)
</P>
<P>
Albright has already visit Saudi Arabia and Syria.

<HEADLINE> Bigger Tankers Able to Pass Suez Canal in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Expansion of the Suez Canal will
enable ships with a draft of up to 62 feet (18.9 meters) to sail
through the waterway by the end of 2000, the chairman of the Suez
Canal Authority (SCA) said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The canal will further be able to accept ships with a draft of
66 feet (20.12 meters) by 2005 and 72 feet (21.95 meters) by 2010,
Ahmed Fadel told reporters in Ismailia, where the SCA is
headquartered.
</P>
<P>
The improvements of the lock-free canal will enable it to take
giant oil tankers of up to 360,000 tons, now the largest tanker
weight in the world, Fadel said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been working to expand the Suez Canal to increase the
weight of passing ships to raise the annual revenue of the canal
as that is the basis for tolls.
</P>
<P>
Fadel said oil pipelines in the Middle East region that are now
closed or operating below capacity could provide fierce
competition for the Suez Canal if reopened or used to their full
extent.
</P>
<P>
If political developments in the region lead these pipelines to
operate at full capacity, the canal will be deprived of most oil
tankers, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The SCA has offered reductions of fees in a bid to lure ships
to sail through the canal, Fadel said. The authority has given
long-haul journeys a fee reduction of 80 percent and offered
reductions for gas tankers 5 to 35 percent in the first half of
1999, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Suez Canal, which earns about 2 billion U.S. dollars each
year, is one of the main sources of hard currency for Egypt, along
with remittances from expatriates, tourism and oil export.

<P>
GAZA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Israel confiscated 17,000 donums
(1,596.3 hectares) of Palestinian land in 1998 to expand Jewish
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and 154 Palestinians
were killed in conflicts triggered by the expansion activities,
said an official report.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish settlement activities also led to the destruction of
20,000 trees and 157 Palestinian houses, the withdrawal of the
identity cards of 420 Palestinian citizens living in Jerusalem,
said an annual report issued on Tuesday by the Palestinian
National Committee on Settlement Combat.
</P>
<P>
Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza reached 200, with
settlers to be 170,000 by the end of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli authorities issued tenders for building 3,000
housing units early last July, the report said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the ongoing settlement activities led to the
suspension of the Palestinian-Israeli final-status talks that deal
with thorny issues including the future of the Israeli
settlements.

<HEADLINE> Mercosur Summit Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Southern Common Market(
Mercosur) countries started Tuesday their last meeting of the
century to evaluate five years of integration and to design a
common policy for the motor sector.
</P>
<P>
The 17th meeting of the Southern Common Market Council is
attended by the ministers of Foreign Affairs and Economy of
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, as well as those of the
associated countries, Bolivia and Chile.
</P>
<P>
The meeting develops in a climate of distension, after
Argentina and Brazil agreed to resolve their trade controversies.
</P>
<P>
An important theme of the meeting is to reach an agreement on
the motor vehicle manufacturing regime. The ministers of industry
of the bloc discussed Monday this problem without reaching any
agreement and continued discussing it Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Argentina and Brazil proposed to raise the custom tariff from
the present 23 percent up to 35 percent to the import of vehicles
from outside Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
But Uruguay is afraid that the application of this tariff to
cars from outside the zone would damage national consumers.
</P>
<P>
And besides, Argentina and Brazil still have some disagreements
about the period of transition of the new motor vehicle regime.
</P>
<P>
Trade among Mercosur countries plunged by almost one-third this
year as economies slowed, commodity prices fell and government
restricted trade, the Washington-based Inter-American Development
Bank said last month.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Mercosur bloc are meeting in an attempt to mend
trade relations and to promote trade among the partners.
</P>
<P>
The Mercosur presidential summit will be held Wednesday with
the attendance of the presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay,
Uruguay and Chile. Bolivian President Hugo Banzer will not attend
the meeting because of the municipal elections in his country.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Menem, one of the Mercosur founders, and Julio Maria
Sanguinetty will bid a formal farewell to the block while
Argentina and Uruguay presidents-elect Fernando de la Rua and
Jorge Batlle, respectively, will take part for the first time in
the summit.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Critical of Barak's Promise on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's recent remarks on halting the Jewish settlement activities
were intended to undermine the Palestinians' position in the
final-status talks, said Palestinian chief negotiator Yasser Abed
Rabbo.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with "Voice of Palestine" radio Tuesday
evening, Abed Rabbo said the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
did not decide to stop the talks with Israel or suspend them.
</P>
<P>
Under Israel's current policy of "usurping the Palestinian
land" and expanding the Jewish settlements, nothing can be
discussed for the time being except the settlement issue, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli maneuver to the Palestinian position through
promises to stop licensing more Jewish settlements can never
deceive anybody," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Barak is responsible for issuing the licenses that render the
peace talks futile," Abed Rabbo underlined.
</P>
<P>
On Monday evening Barak said his government would no longer
issue settlement licenses in an effort to salvage the final-status
talks that were boycotted by the Palestinian side in protest
against the settlement expansion.
</P>
<P>
Barak said the continuation of settlement activities harmed
Israel's status in the world as well as the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Administration had said that the continuation of
settlement expansion would spoil the environment for the peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
On Monday evening, Palestinian chief negotiator in the interim
period Saeb Erekat told the "Voice of Palestine" radio that
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright should work for
stopping the Jewish settlement activities that undermine the basis
of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The settlement issue led to the cancellation of a meeting
between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli chief
negotiator Obed Eran in Jerusalem Tuesday morning.

<HEADLINE> Albright Says More Optimistic After Meeting Assad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright described her meeting with Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad as "very constructive" and said she was
"more optimistic" than before her arrival here earlier Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"President Assad and me work for the resumption of the talks on
the Syrian-Israeli track," she told reporters here Tuesday evening
before leaving for Israel as part of her ongoing Middle East tour.
</P>
<P>
Assad is serious in his pursuit for the best constructive way
of resuming the talks, Albright pointed out.
</P>
<P>
She added that she would meet Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak. "I will be able to discuss with Barak the point we arrived
at now," she noted.
</P>
<P>
"I am leaving Damascus with a more optimistic feeling than the
one I used to have before I came here today," Albright reasserted.
</P>
<P>
As for the reason for her optimism, she said "We hold intensive
talks with the different parties on issues related to the Syrian
track. I think it is better, as I have said, not to get into
details."
</P>
<P>
Albright asserted that all parties concerned in the peace
process hope for an early resumption of the talks between Syria
and Israel which have been stalled since 1996.
</P>
<P>
She stressed the necessity of continuing work on each track
according to its momentum without any backtracking.
</P>
<P>
After meeting Barak and visiting Egypt, she will submit a

JERUSALEM -- The Israeli party of Meretz has threatened to quit
the coalition if the government continues its policies of settlement
expansion, land expropriations, deportations and home demolitions
against the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Meretz's threat to quit the government followed Monday's
decision by the Palestinians not to continue with peace talks
until Israel stops settlement expansion.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the Housing Ministry issued tenders for building
another 500 houses for settlers in the West Bank, bringing the
total housing units approved to be built under the current
government to 3,196 since it came to power in July.

made the statements at a meeting with a number of activists of his

JERUSALEM -- Israel can not release more Palestinian prisoners
before the Muslim holy month of Ramadan as the two sides failed to
agree on the list of prisoners to be freed, Israel Radio reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted Israeli security sources as saying that
Israeli and Palestinian officials have met for several times
recently on the issue, but no agreement was reached on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side insisted that the next release be done
according to the list submitted by the Palestinian side, a request
rejected by Israel on grounds that some prisoners the Palestinians
asked for can not go due to security reasons, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Considering Israel's security, the list of the prisoners slated
for release can only be decided by Israel, said the sources.

<P>
PARIS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Lazio has another option in front
after they signed a 18-month contract with Marseille striker
Fabrizio Ravanelli.
</P>
<P>
The Italian said Wednesday in Marseille that he has signed for
Lazio but the striker did not reveal the exact transfer fee.
</P>
<P>
Ravanelli made the announcement after flying back from
Rotterdam, where Feyernoord routed Marseille 3-0 in a European
champions league match Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old striker has been left in the cold by the newly-
appointed coach Bernard Casoni who prefers French internationals
Florian Maurice and Christophe Dugarry up front.
</P>
<P>
It will also be hard for Ravanelli to be started in Lazio which
can already choose between strikers Marcelo Salas, Simone Inzaghi,
Alen Boksic and Roberto Mancini.
</P>
<P>
Capped 21 times and a European champions league winner with
Juventus, Ravanelli scored 28 goals for Marseille since arriving
from English club Middlesbrough in October 1997.

The meeting -- which brought together African governments,
donor governments of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD), United Nations agencies, the private sector
and civil society -- agreed on the principles and priorities which
will form the basis of a five-year plan of action to combat HIV/
AIDS in Africa, to be launched next May in Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
Africa's southern and eastern region, with less than 5 percent
of the world's population, is home to more than 50 percent of
those living with HIV. It is where 60 percent of all AIDS deaths
have happened so far. And it is where a whole generation of
children is now losing its parents to AIDS. By the end of this
year, the global epidemic will have left 11 million orphans -- and
90 percent of them will be African children.

<HEADLINE> EU Executive Launches E-Europe Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- European Commission President
Romano Prodi announced an e-Europe initiative Wednesday in a bid
to accelerate Europe's transformation into an information society
and bring the benefits of information society within reach of all
Europeans.
</P>
<P>
The initiative focuses on 10 priority areas, which include
education, transport, health care and support of the disabled.
</P>
<P>
As one of Prodi's objectives and priorities for the Helsinki
European Union (EU) summit on Friday and Saturday, the initiative
is a key element in the president's strategy to modernize the
European economy.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement released by the commission, the EU's
executive body, the main objectives of the e-Europe initiative are
bringing every citizen, home and school, every business and
administration, online and into the digital age and creating a
digitality literate Europe, supported by an entreprenurial culture
ready to finance and develop new ideas.
</P>
<P>
Noting that information society will affect everyone everywhere,
Prodi said that managing this transformation represents one of the
central economic and social challenges facing Europe today.
</P>
<P>
"The e-Europe initiative is intended to help overcome these
challenges and thereby accelerate the modernization of the
European economy, with a positive impact on employment, growth,
productivity and social cohesion," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Europe has already successfully accomplished historic projects
such as the single market and the euro. There is no reason not to
take the political step of producing a similar dynamic forward-
looking response to information society," Prodi added.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Offer Insufficient: Palestinian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Israel's offer to freeze
settlement expansion for the next three months would be
insufficient to bring about the resumption of Israeli-Palestinian
final-status talks, said a senior Palestinian official Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Abu Rudeineh, advisor to Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, told the Israel Radio that settlement freeze announced by
Prime Minister Ehud Barak Tuesday was a "foggy and insufficient
offer."
</P>
<P>
Barak had said that he would, at least during the next three
months, freeze plans to add 1,800 more houses to Jewish settlers
in the West Bank in order to push the Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks forward.
</P>
<P>
Building more settlers' houses in the settlement will interfere
with Israel's efforts to strike a final peace accord with the
Palestinians, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks stalled on Monday
after Palestinian chief negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo announced
that he would not negotiate with Israel on any other issue except
the settlement until Israel stops expanding Jewish settlements on
occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
But Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami said Wednesday
that Israeli government would still permit "natural growth" of the
settlements to continue with the construction that is already
underway.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who arrived in
Israel Tuesday night, met with Barak Wednesday in an effort to
help break the deadlock of the final-status talks.

<P>
MOGADISHU, December 8 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Sources confirmed
Wednesday in Nairobi that two U.N. officials have been deported
from Somalia for "not collaborating" by the regional government of
Northeastern Somalia known as Puntland.
</P>
<P>
The regional authorities ordered on Tuesday Siar Henelen and
Saed Al- Namari, officers of the UN Development Program (UNDP) and
UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) based in Bossaso, to leave Puntland
within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
The local authorities also declared head of the U.N. office for
the development of commerce in the region Edward Jones as persona
non grata. Jones is now in Nairobi and was ordered not to come
back again to Puntland forever .
</P>
<P>
Information Minister of Puntland Awad Ahmed Asharoh, while
speaking with reporters Tuesday, accused these officials for not
collaborating with the administration.
</P>
<P>
He also accused the U.N officials of propagating false
information on the security situation in the area and of not
fulfilling development projects they were heading in the region.
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Puntland administration has asked the U.N.
offices in Nairobi to replace these officials.
</P>
<P>
The relation between Puntland and the United Nations has been
smooth ever since the regional administration was established
about two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has been running offices in almost all of
the regions and towns to help the drought-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the offices of Puntland said that the U.N.
officials have lately been attempting to secure direct contact
with local communities. This has angered the administration which
wanted to act as the only go-and-between element.

<HEADLINE> SAARC Marks 14th Charter Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The South Asian Association
for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) on Wednesday celebrated here the
14th anniversary of the signing of its Charter, which marks the
founding of the regional bloc.
</P>
<P>
On December 8, 1985, the Heads of States and Governments of
South Asia signed the Charter of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation and the Dhaka Declaration to accelerate the
process of economic and social development and cooperation in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, Prime Minister Krishna Prasad
Bhattarai said the SAARC Charter embodies the lofty goals of peace,
stability, amity and progress in South Asia and provides a
framework of cooperation for its realization.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, "we consider SAARC Charter as a vital instrument for
the promotion of regional identity and solidarity and remain fully
committed to this objective," said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Bhattarai said though some efforts have been made towards
poverty alleviation, the success in this field is still a long way
off.
</P>
<P>
"The time has come to seriously think as to how we could
promote a genuine partnership and mobilize resources, both
national as well as regional, in liberating South Asia from the
poverty," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a felicitation message, SAARC chairperson, Sri Lankan
President Chandrika Kumaratunga said SAARC has made considerable
progress to promote conditions for fruitful regional cooperation,
particularly in respect of the economic agenda.
</P>
<P>
"However, much remains to be done not only to strengthen
regional cohesion, but also to provide our citizens with fair
opportunities to realize their undoubted potential," she said.
</P>
<P>
In the past 14 years of its existence, although SAARC has made
some progress in social and economic cooperation, the only
substantive achievement is the SAARC Preferential Trading
Arrangement (SAPTA), which went into operation in 1995 and marked
the first step for realizing free trade among its member countries.
</P>
<P>
Under SAPTA, 5,700 items of products enjoy tariff concessions
ranging from 7.5 to 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC chairperson expressed hope that the 11th SAARC Summit
would be hold soon to consolidate the achievements of preceding
summits and to work out practical strategies for the development
of the region.
</P>
<P>
The 11th SAARC summit slated for November 26-28 was postponed
after a military coup in Pakistan ousted the civilian government
on October 12.
</P>
<P>
SAARC groups Bangladesh, India, Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan, the
Maldives and Sri Lanka.

<HEADLINE> Indian Parliament Passes Foreign Exchange Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW DELHI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The controversial Foreign
Exchange Bill (FEMA) was passed Wednesday in the Indian Parliament
with Rajya Sabha, the Upper House, approving it by voice vote.
</P>
<P>
The Lower House, or Lok Sabha, passed the bill last Thursday
along with the Prevention Money Laundering Bill (PMLB).
</P>
<P>
However, PMLB, which also came up for consideration in the
Rajya Sabha, was referred to a select committee of the house after
discussion.
</P>
<P>
Before passage of the two bills, Finance Minister Yashwant
Sinha asserted that the bill had been necessitated as time had
come to shift from regulation to management of foreign exchange in
the wake of improved foreign exchange position in the country.
</P>
<P>
The twin legislations are to replace the outmoded and
draconian Foreign Exchange regulation Act.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Upper House passed another controversial bill,
the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority Bill, which got
approval in the Lower House last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The passage of the bills meant to open the insurance and
financial sectors to private and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The legislations on foreign exchange and money laundering
provide for stringent penalties to offenders and facilitate
external trade by removing hurdles to legitimize foreign exchange
transactions.
</P>
<P>
A number of amendment proposals in the names of Congress party
and other opposition members against certain provisions of the two
bills were not taken up.

those entering and leaving Macao bear legal certificates, the
director said.
</P>
<P>
Cheong Kuok Va, secretary-designate for security of the future
Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR), also told the media
recently that he is confident about better public security in the
SAR, noting that the close cooperation between police forces in
the two places is vital for fighting crimes.
</P>
<P>
Likely, the SAR's chief executive-designate Edmund Ho Hau Wah
reiterated on different occasions that the Macao SAR government
will take resolute measures to tackle the problem of public
security.
</P>
<P>
In the run-up to Macao's power transfer from Portugal to China,
some gang members attempted to reap profits before the handover.
In the meantime, the number of kidnapping and murdering cases is
also on the increase.
</P>
<P>
As the handover is drawing near, police forces in Macao have
exerted decisive efforts to round up criminal suspects, and local
judicial organs have made serious rulings about several organized
crimes.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the combat against crimes in Macao is well
coordinated by the police in Guangdong. In addition to the regular
security conferences attended by senior security officials, senior
liaison officers from both sides have been named to make contacts
at any time.
</P>
<P>
Technically, Guangdong police have given full support to their
counterparts in Macao. In particular, Guangdong specialists
usually help offer vital analysis about some serious criminal
cases.
</P>
<P>
"To ensure that the handover goes on smoothly, Guangdong police
this year put on special file 12 major criminal cases, all of
which were involved in trans-boundary crimes," Chen Shaoji said. "
Up to now, eight cases have been cracked with effective
cooperation with police in Macao."
</P>
<P>
He noted that such kind of police cooperation will benefit
Guangdong as well as Macao in terms of fighting crimes and
maintaining good social order.
</P>
<P>
"The cooperation will not be weakened after Macao's return to
the motherland, but will be strengthened," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> More Progress on Israeli-Syrian Track, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said here Wednesday that she is more
optimistic than ever about the possibility that Israel and Syria
will soon resume peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after talks with Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak, Albright said she has made "good progress" in talks
with Barak toward achieving a resumption of the Israeli-Syrian
talks.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's fair to say that we made good progress toward
meeting our objectives," she said, adding that "details, like
mushrooms, are developed better away from the light."
</P>
<P>
Albright was reluctant to give more details about the talks
with Barak, but said that they had discussed in details both the
Israeli-Syrian track and the ongoing Israeli-palestinian
final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
But reliable sources here said that during talks, Albright
briefed Barak on her Tuesday's visit to Damascus and the talks she
held with Syrian President Hafez Assad.
</P>
<P>
She informed Barak of President Assad's positions on key issues
relating to the resumption of peace talks, such as Israel's
withdrawal from the Golan Heights, the character and content of
peace with Israel, the timing of the peace agreement and security
arrangements along the border between the two countries, the
sources added.
</P>
<P>
"There is more of an understanding of the historic
opportunities that exist," she said, "we have a greater sense of
optimism and from my meetings both here and in Damascus I have the
sense that there is a desire to seize the moment."
</P>
<P>
Albright also appeared eager to dispel reports that Assad is
too ill to seize control of the negotiations with Israel, noting
that Assad personally seemed intent on moving the contacts with
Israel forward.
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli-Syrian track, Barak said "there is clearly a
unique opportunity," stressing that he was more committed to move
the Israeli-Syrian track forward.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, Albright
said the attempt to sign a framework agreement on final-status by
next February is a "bold objective, but achievable."
</P>
<P>
"Success will depend on creating trust and that means creating
the best possible environment for the negotiations. Each side
needs to avoid taking steps that will embarrass the other side in
the process," she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
She was apparently referring to Israel's settlement activities
and Palestinians' decision to hold up talks with Israel to protest
against its settlement expansions in the territories.
</P>
<P>
Barak, meanwhile, repeated his commitment to freezing future
West Bank settlement constructions in order to facilitate the
resumption of the suspended talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the approaching deadline for a tentative accord on
final-status, Barak said the timetable is necessary to help move
the talks forward, but added that he won't jump from tower if it
takes another month.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy also participated in the
talks, which was held at Barak's residence and lasted about two
hours.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who arrived in Israel Tuesday night from Damascus,
is scheduled to hold talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
in the West Bank city of Ramallah later Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Confident on Keeping New Budget Intact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Wednesday he remains confident that he can convince
the Congress to pass the proposed 651-billion-peso (16.3 billion U.
S. dollars) budget for the year 2000 intact.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said in Mindanao in a radio interview that Secretary
Benjamin Diokno of the Department of Budget and Management would
ask the Congress not to slash the budget.
</P>
<P>
"I believe I can still convince the Senate to change its mind.
Perhaps when we return to Manila, Diokno can explain our side to
the senators and make it clear why we want the budget passed in
its entirety," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, senators are poised to cut 50-60 billion
pesos (1.25-1.5 billion dollars) from the proposed budget for the
next year to reduce the deficit.
</P>
<P>
Estrada reiterated he needs the budget's full amount to
bankroll his pro-poor programs aimed at ensuring food security,
building job-generating infrastructure and housing projects as
well as improving the delivery of basic services to the people.
</P>
<P>
On the same radio program, Diokno said he might make his
explanation to the Congress once the budget goes through a final
review by the bicameral conference committee.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps it is best to wait until the budget reaches the
bicameral committee because the Senate version is very different
from the House version. We will explain the budget before the
bicameral committee," he said.

BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have been
urged to produce popular science books as good as "100,000
Questions" which has been chosen as one of the 50 most influential

DAR ES SALAAM, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will continue to
depend on air transport to ferry people and goods because it still

</P>
<P>
Addressing the International Civil Aviation Day ceremony at the

Minister for Communications and Transport Amani Abeid Karume said
the country has experienced her own share of air tariff growth

With this recognition, the government through its trade
liberalization policy has substantially de-regulated the domestic
operations, the minister said.

The move, he said, has significantly increased the number of
air operators and airlines.

<HEADLINE> 45th Anniversary of Qinghai-Tibet Highway Celebrated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GOLMUD, December 8 (Xinhua) -- A celebration was held here
today for the 45th anniversary of the opening of the world's
highest road, the Qinghai-Tibet highway, winding across the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,000 officials, soldiers and local residents attended the
gathering.
</P>
<P>
The highway, from Xining, capital city of Qinghai province, to
Lhasa, capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, was completed and
opened to traffic 45 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Linking the remote "roof of the world" with the vast inland
area, the 1,937-kilometer highway is truly a lifeline for Tibet
and Qinghai.
</P>
<P>
Much of highway passes through either freezing areas on high
ice-capped mountains or harsh deserts that are prone to natural
disasters.
</P>
<P>
Its construction involved five years of diligent effort by more
than 10,000 young technicians, soldiers and workers as well as
huge state investment.
</P>
<P>
The highway has been well-maintained during the 45 years.
During that time, millions of passengers and millions of tons of
cargo have been transported across it, and the difficulty in
communication between Tibet and other parts of the country has
been greatly relieved because of it.
</P>
<P>
From the 1950s to the 1980s, the central government invested
two billion yuan to renovate the highway. Afterwards, heavy
investment has been put into highway renovation projects and
maintenance year after year.
</P>
<P>
Now the country is carrying out a new round of highway upgrades.

MACAO, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Police forces of both Macao and
neighboring Guangdong Province in south China will strengthen
cooperation in the future to combat organized crimes, a senior
Chinese police official said.
</P>

"While observing the 'one country, two systems' principle,
police departments in Guangdong will make active efforts to expand
the exchange and cooperation with Macao police in cracking down on
organized crimes and safeguard public security in the two areas,"

Chen went back to Guangdong Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After Macao's return to the motherland on December 20,
Guangdong police will carry out tighter controls along the
boundary between Guangdong and Macao so as to ensure that all
those entering and leaving Macao bear legal certificates, the
director said.

will take resolute measures to tackle the problem of public
security.
</P>
<P>
In the run-up to Macao's power transfer from Portugal to China,
some gang members attempted to reap profits before the handover.
In the meantime, the number of kidnapping and murdering cases is
also on the increase.
</P>
<P>
As the handover is drawing near, police forces in Macao have
exerted decisive efforts to round up criminal suspects, and local
judicial organs have made serious rulings about several organized
crimes.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the combat against crimes in Macao is well
coordinated by the police in Guangdong. In addition to the regular
security conferences attended by senior security officials, senior
liaison officers from both sides have been named to make contacts
at any time.
</P>
<P>
Technically, Guangdong police have given full support to their
counterparts in Macao. In particular, Guangdong specialists
usually help offer vital analysis about some serious criminal
cases.
</P>
<P>
"To ensure that the handover goes on smoothly, Guangdong
police this year put on special file 12 major criminal cases, all
of which were involved in trans-boundary crimes," Chen Shaoji said.
"Up to now, eight cases have been cracked with effective
cooperation with police in Macao."
</P>
<P>
He noted that such kind of police cooperation will benefit
Guangdong as well as Macao in terms of fighting crimes and
maintaining good social order.
</P>
<P>
"The cooperation will not be weakened after Macao's return to
the motherland, but will be strengthened," he stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The final-status negotiations
between the Palestinians and Israel will be resumed Thursday in
the West Bank town of Ramallah, Palestinian sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Reports coming from Ramallah quote the sources as saying that
the new round of negotiations will only deal with the issue of
settlements, as requested by the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement made by Palestinian chief negotiator
Yasser Abed Rabbo, the cessation of Jewish settlement activity in
the occupied territories tops the Palestinian side's agenda.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side suspended the eighth session of
negotiations last Sunday in protest against continued Israeli
settlement activity, stressing that the settlement issue is the
only topic to be taken up in view of continued settlement activity.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak pledged Monday not to offer
new tenders for the construction of settlement housing units so
that final status negotiations can proceed.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side is expected to raise the issue of
settlement activity at Wednesday evening's meeting between
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat and visiting
United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Visits Noted Scientist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today visited Qian Xuesen, a famous scientist who has contributed
much to the country's cause of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Qian is one of the pioneers of China's space science. A world-
famous expert on aerospace rockets and aerodynamics, Qian has made
outstanding contributions to the development of science and
technology in China, space technology in particular.
</P>
<P>
Due to research and development led by Qian, China successfully
exploded its first atom bomb in 1964, launched its first man-made
satellite in 1970, and fired its first transcontinental ballistic
missile toward the Pacific in 1980.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the Chinese president and Qian shared a
lively chat on the trial flight of the Shenzhou spacecraft and the
new developments in China's science and technology.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China has made great strides in its science
and technology, and in some areas has reached the world advanced
level, the president said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the achievements to the hard work of the older
scientists such as Qian, and to the unremitting efforts of all
those in the science and technology field.
</P>
<P>
Science and technology represents the most important productive
force, Jiang said, adding that China's modernization and the
revitalization of the nation call for the development of science
and technology and technological renovation.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who is about to celebrate his 88th birthday, agreed, and
made some suggestions on the further developments of science and
technology, and national defense.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Qian also noted that he fully supports the
government's ban of the Falun Gong cult.
</P>
<P>
Falun Gong is an evil cult with political motives, and deserves
the banning and criticism, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing accompanied the president on
his visit.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Commerce and
Industries Minister Tofail Ahmed Wednesday said that the least
developed countries (LDCs) had succeeded in setting their tone on
duty and quota free market at the just concluded Seattle meeting
of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Duty and quota free market access of products of LDCs is the
only way to integrate economies of LDCs with multilateral trading
system, Ahmed said, adding "I am absolutely hopeful that the LDCs
will get the preferential treatment from the developed countries
in the days ahead though the third WTO ministerial-level meeting
ended without any settlement."
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks while talking to newsmen at his
office here about the outcome of the WTO meeting held from
November 30 to December 3.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed, spokesman of LDCs at the Seattle meeting, said that all
the 135 participating countries unanimously accepted the 22-point
declaration adopted by the trade ministers of 48 LDCs at the
meeting which was presided over by Ahmed himself.
</P>
<P>
Developed countries now have understood that a new approach
should be adopted to revitalize the success of the initial work
done under the integrated framework and strengthening forms of
cooperation, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed said the LDCs are hopeful that the next WTO Geneva
convention will take energetic action to broaden and improve the
ability of the LDCs' transitional economies to take advantage of
the global trading system.

hailed the friendly relations between China and Nepal during talks
this afternoon with Nepal's army chief Prajwal Shumshere Jung

</P>
<P>
Fu, also a member of the Central Military Commission, said that
the two peoples have been treating each other as equals and

friendly relations with its neighbors on the basis of the five
principles of peaceful co-existence.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Denies Presence of Marines in Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States Embassy
in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, has denied the report that American
Marines were present in Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The Reporter newspaper quoted the U.S. embassy as saying that
the so- called presence in Eritrea of American Marines is
"patently false and counterproductive to peace efforts".
</P>
<P>
There are currently no U.S. Marines in Eritrea, and there have
been no U. S. troops in the Horn of Africa country at any recent
time, the embassy said.
</P>
<P>
The United States continues to support unreservedly peace
efforts made by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) for
resolving the border conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea, it
said.
</P>
<P>
False stories and inflammatory rhetoric, no matter where they
appear, serve only to endanger and undermine the committed and
untiring efforts of the OAU to bring about an honorable peace in
the region, the embassy said.
</P>
<P>
The Reporter newspaper published an article late November,
alleging that American Marines were present in Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. Embassy, a U.S. team of Defence
Department visited Ethiopia, Eritrea and other countries in the
region last month to discuss mine clearance projects.

<HEADLINE> Russians Start to Storm Chechen Town of Urus-Martan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian troops started an
operation Wednesday morning to liberate another key Chechen town
of Urus-Martan, said the General Staff of the Russian Armed Force.
</P>
<P>
 Urus-Martan, 20 kilometers southwest of Grozny, capital of
the breakaway republic, was completely encircled by Russian units
Monday. The Russian military said the troops are implementing old
tactics, whose main goal is to press the rebels out of the town
with minimal losses and destruction.
</P>
<P>
A high-ranking representative of the General Staff said
Wednesday no "frontal assault" will be launched to liberate Urus-
Martan and that the rebels will be pushed out in an artillery
strike.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that the operation is being directed by
commander of the federal western grouping Vladimir Shamanov. The
Russian forces are being assisted by a pro-Russian Chechen corps
led by ex-mayor of Grozny Bislan Gantamirov.
</P>
<P>
Russia began its military offensive against the Chechen
separatists in late September after Chechen rebels' armed
incursions into neighboring federal republic of Daghestan and a
spate of apartment building blasts. Russia blamed Chechen
militants for having killed over 300 people in Moscow and two
other Russian cities during the explosions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Russian groupings successively freed the second and
the third biggest Chechen cities of Gudermes and Argun, and closed
the surrounding of Grozny. By now, Russian units have reportedly
controlled two thirds of Chechen territory.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 8 (Xinhua) -- South African Defense
Minister Patrick Lekota warned Tuesday that a peace agreement in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) cannot be successfully
implemented unless the United Nations plays a larger and more
effective role.
</P>
<P>
Lekota made the remarks while discussing the volatile situation
in the DRC with U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, who gave a
tepid response to the call for a larger U.N. role, South African
Press Associated reported.
</P>
<P>
"We do think that the United Nations is in a position to
increase its participation in the process because we don't believe
we are in a position to successfully implement the agreement
without effective support from the United Nations," Lekota said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen told reporters after the meeting with Lekota that "we
think there has to be a peace before there can be an eventual
peacekeeping mission in there."
</P>
<P>
"I would agree with Minister Lekota that more has to be done
and more leadership has to be exercised certainly by the United
Nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite a July 10 peace agreement reached in Lusaka, serious
fighting between rebels and forces backing the government of
Laurent Kabila have strained the ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan last month recommended the
deployment of a 500-member observer force to Kinshasa to pave the
way for a peacekeeping force, but so far only a small technical
evaluation mission has been deployed in the war-torn country.

MANILA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government

of 18 percent over the 1998 figure of 2.149 million.
</P>
<P>
Gemma Cruz Araneta, secretary of the Department of Tourism,
said Wednesday that by 2004, the country expects to receive at
least 4.4 million tourists, a two-fold increase over the 1998

Araneta said the projections can be attained in the light of
the government's "rediscovery" program which aims to maximize
visitor arrivals through varied means.

She said the theme "rediscovery" revitalizes the industry
through exploration and adventure, spurring domestic tourism,
highlighting the country's treasures, and encouraging overseas
Filipinos to explore their roots in the country.
</P>
<P>
Other goals and priorities in the tourism development program
centered on the generation of employment opportunities, diversity
of attractions, environmental protection, community involvement,

<HEADLINE> Estrada Says Cabinet Change Is not Revamp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Wednesday that any possible change in his cabinet
could not be called a revamp, and that it will not mean a total
make-over of his administration.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed this in his regular weekly program aired
from Mindanao where he has been holding meetings with local
officials and members of low-income groups since Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Yes there may be some changes in my cabinet, but this is not
really a revamp as reported in the media," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, the changes in his cabinet may not
even be announced all in one day, adding that replacements and new
appointments may come over a period of months.
</P>
<P>
In another radio interview, Estrada said all reports citing
names of officials who will be replaced are pure speculations
since he has not yet made up his mind.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the only thing certain in the changes is his
decision to move for the abolition of the Economic Intelligence
Investigation Bureau (EIIB) and his acceptance of the resignation
of its head Wilfredo Nicolas.
</P>
<P>
Although he did not generalize in accusing all the officials of
the EIIB of conniving with smugglers, President Estrada said many
of them should leave the bureau, even before it is abolished.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada noted that the EIIB has failed to curb
smuggling in the country.
</P>
<P>
Estrada added that he may create a task force composed of
members of the Presidential Security Group and Intelligence
Service of the Armed Forces to undertake intensive campaign
against smugglers.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing
today called for concrete measures to continue the government's
active fiscal policy for next year.
</P>
<P>
Li, also member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee,
made the call at a national conference on fiscal policies, which
opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The insufficient domestic demand still creates a major problem
for the country's economy next year, the vice premier noted. After
weighing the pros and cons, the CPC Central Committee and the
State Council have decided to continue to pursue an active fiscal
policy, he said.
</P>
<P>
This policy will greatly affect the fate of the state-owned
enterprises, industrial restructuring, sustained development and
long-term prosperity and stability of the nation, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Financial departments all over the country should make more
efforts and ensure the policy is implemented fully, Li said.

fiscal and monetary policies for the fast growth of the national
economy.

<HEADLINE> Charges Against Ousted Pak Premier Delayed Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 8 (Xinhua) -- An Anti-Terrorism Court in
Karachi on Wednesday delayed formal charges against ousted
Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif and six others until
December 13.
</P>
<P>
The court said the charge sheet submitted by the prosecution
did not have necessary accompanying materials, informed sources
told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"In order to have a fair trial the prosecution is directed to
supply copies and transcripts of audio and video cassettes to the
defense by Monday," Judge Shabbier Ahmed said.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors submitted charge sheet to the court, copied of
which was then distributed to the accused, but failed to provide
audio and video records which were said to be important evidences
against the accused.
</P>
<P>
Nawaz Sharif, who has been under detention since a coup on
October 12, and six others have been accused of attempted murder,
plane hijacking, criminal conspiracy and common intent.
</P>
<P>
They allegedly attempted to prevent an civil plane, which was
carrying General Pervaiz Musharraf, then army chief of Pakistan,
back from abroad, from landing at the Karachi airport on October
12.
</P>
<P>
The army then launched a bloodless coup d'etat and dismissed
the Sharif government and General Musharraf announced himself
chief executive of the country.
</P>
<P>
The formal charges against Sharif had been postponed twice,
first from November 26 to December 4, and then from December 4 to
December 8.
</P>
<P>
Justice Ahmed was appointed to handle the case following last
week's amendment in the country's Anti-Terrorism Act, which
empowered anti-terrorism courts to try cases of treason, hijacking,
kidnapping and criminal conspiracy among others.
</P>
<P>
At the court, Sharif again complained of poor facilities he was
provided when in custody. He said he had no access to television
or radio and that his cell was like a cage.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the former prime minister's complains, Justice
Ahmed said he would consider sending a delegation to the prison to
check if conditions for Sharif met legal standards.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President to Maintain Unitary State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid insisted on Wednesday that he would maintain the
unitary state of Indonesia, saying no tolerance would be given to
Acehnese that want to establish a free Aceh state.
</P>
<P>
"Aceh will always be a part of the unitary state of Indonesia,"
Wahid said in a consultation meeting with the House of
Representatives (DPR) leadership.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was the first which was openly conducted since
Wahid took office in October. It deliberated several important and
crucial issues in the political and economic sectors which the
country had been dealing with.
</P>
<P>
Wahid insisted that he would settle the Aceh problem as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
"This is not an easy thing of course (to solve the Aceh problem)
. It will take time but with the house support, I am sure we can
handle the problem well," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president also explained that the neighboring countries
such as ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) members,
China, Japan and the Middle East countries had given support to
him to take actions to maintain the unitary state of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know, they also don't want to see Indonesia to be
a separated country, and about Aceh they also have given support
to us," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Wahid also said he would visit Irian Jaya and Ambon, the
capital of Maluku province, in a bid to collect comprehensive data
which would be inputs to the government to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
Irian Jaya province with a population of 2 million has been
demanding independence from Indonesia. Maluku province has been
ravaged by a series of communal clashes over the last few months
claiming hundreds of civilian lives.
</P>
<P>
"Along with the vice president I will visit the two troubled
areas soon," Wahid said.
</P>
<P>
The head of state gave the tentative date for his visit to
Ambon as December 11 or 12. The visit to Irian Jaya, Wahid said,
would be on December 31.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's Telecommunication Develops Rapidly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 8 (Xinhua) -- With the rapid development
of telecommunication and modern technology, the number of
telephones in Cambodia has increased about 20-fold in six years,
according to Prime Minister Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
"Before the general election in 1993, we had only more than 6,
000 telephones throughout the country, but at the end of 1999, we
would have 115,786," Hun Sen said Wednesday in a speech at the
official inauguration of the GSM system and the stone-laying
ceremony for the new Samart Building.
</P>
<P>
The figures offered by the Ministry of Post and Communication
show that so far there are 86,943 mobile and 28,843 fixed
telephones in Cambodia, covering 0.89 percent of a population of
about 11.7 million.
</P>
<P>
Of the total 115,786 telephones, 95,600 are in Phnom Penh,
covering 9.34 percent of its 1 million population.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia Samart Communication "SAMART" is a joint venture
between Samart Corporation Public Company Limited of Thailand and
Telekom Malaysia Berhad of Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"The existence over the past seven years of Samart company, one
of the major companies in Cambodia, as well as its efforts to
expand the telecommunication service to cover many municipalities
and provinces have extensive meanings for the development of the
telecommunication sector in Cambodia -- both state and private,"
the prime minister added.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen told reporters that "the royal government encourages
the private sector to invest in Cambodia's post and
telecommunication, but the number and the scale should be decided
in accordance with the demand of market."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the prime minister emphasized that the fact
that the government allows private investment never means the
private sector is allowed to control state property.
</P>
<P>
The GSM system will pave the way for better mobile
communications services in Cambodia. In future, under a GSM
platform, many other services will be offered like mobile Internet
services, according to Samart.

<HEADLINE> Barak Emphasizes Israel's Adherence to Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
reiterated Wednesday morning his country's adherence to the
obligations in the peace process with its neighbors, and to the
hand-over of more occupied lands to the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a joint news conference with visiting United States
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in Jerusalem, Barak said his
talks with Albright has made progress.
</P>
<P>
Barak reaffirmed that Israel is the one that will define the
area of the territories to be transferred to the Palestinian side
under the second phase of redeployment, anticipating that these
territories will shortly be handed over.
</P>
<P>
On her part, Albright said the U.S. will spare no effort to
prompt the Palestinians and Israel to expedite the peace process,
expressing her conviction that an agreement may be reached on the
framework of the final status and lasting settlement between the
two sides according to fixed dates.
</P>
<P>
Declining to reply directly to a question as to whether the
Palestinians have a role in defining the location of the second
phase of Israeli redeployment, she said the issue ought to be
resolved by the two parties through cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Albright will be meeting here with her Israeli counterpart
David Levy at the Israeli Foreign Ministry, after which she will
attend a luncheon in her honor by Israeli President Ezer Weizman.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of state arrived in Israel Tuesday evening
within her Middle East tour to push forward the Palestinian-Israeli
final status and transition phase negotiations which have reached
a deadlock lately.
</P>
<P>
She is due to meet Wednesday evening in the West Bank city of
Ramallah with Chairman of the Palestinian National Authority
Yasser Arafat for the same purpose.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- About 13 percent of 4.1 million
Zambian children became orphans as a result of the deadly AIDS,
according to a Zambian government official.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Hellen Matanda, permanent secretary of
Ministry of Sport, Youth and Child Development, on Tuesday at the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) press conference on the
situation analysis of orphans and vulnerable children in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's Times of Zambia newspaper quoted Matanda as saying
these children fell prey to drug abuse while others were raped.
</P>
<P>
The AIDS infection had reached such alarming levels that
Zambia's future was bleak as youths' productive lives were not
guaranteed, she said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, UNICEF representative in Zambia Peter McDermott said
the magnitude of the problem of orphans and vulnerable children in
the country was much more than what was perceived.
</P>
<P>
"We have more orphans, street children and vulnerable children
than what we thought," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said there was urgent need for the government and
non-governmental organizations to work out an action plan which
would help redress the situation.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-British Joint
Liaison Group (JLG) concluded the 47th meeting here Wednesday,
thus bringing to a successful end of its historic mission.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting, the last of the group,
representatives of both China and Britain reviewed the work of the
JLG since its establishment in May 1985 and discussed matters of
common concern as well as Hong Kong's future under the "one
country, two systems" principle.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-British JLG will be dismissed on January 1,2000 in
accordance with the Joint Declaration between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a media briefing after the meeting, Wu Hongbo,
Chinese senior representative, said the JLG has accomplished its
historic mission entrusted by the two governments.
</P>
<P>
"The implementation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration is a
challenging and unprecedented job. Many of the questions that the
JLG handled have never cropped up in the field of the
international law nor international practices. However we
successfully resolved these questions through cooperation," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Wu said China and Britain share the common interests of
maintaining Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability on the
basis of the Joint Declaration although they have different
concepts of values and ways of handling issues.
</P>
<P>
That's why both sides are able to cooperate with each other and
solve one question after another and make due contribution to the
smooth transition and transfer of power in Hong Kong, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Wu pointed out that the "one country, two systems" principle is
the key to the solution of the question of Hong Kong as well as to
the insurance of its long-term prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
The work of the Sino-British JLG has proved this point, post-
handover Hong Kong has proved this point and Macao which will
return to the motherland will further demonstrate this point, he
said.

<P>
LUSAKA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Former Zambian President and
opposition leader Kenneth Kaunda is facing challenge from within
his own party, which will hold an extraordinary congress next
month to elect new top leader.
</P>
<P>
United National Independence Party (UNIP) Chairman Malimba
Masheke and General Secretary Grey Zulu have already said they
will contest the UNIP top leadership with Kaunda, who had been
ruling Zambia since the country's independence in 1964 until 1991,
when he was defeated by current President Frederick Chiluba in the
general elections.
</P>
<P>
Masheke said here on Tuesday that his decision to challenge
Kaunda should not be seen as a personal fight between the two but
as a chance to revive the party.
</P>
<P>
He claimed in an interview with The Post newspaper that
majority of the UNIP central committee members have endorsed his
candidature.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted him as saying that UNIP is slowly
dying and the only way to rejuvenate it is to usher in "new
blood".
</P>
<P>
He described Kaunda as his mentor, however, he said that time
has come for him to give way to people he has groomed to take over
the power within the party.
</P>
<P>
Masheke said, "I will make sure when I get the UNIP presidency
and eventually the state presidency in 2001 that Dr. Kaunda is
taken care of."

policy and component of China's reunification cause," he stressed.
"The principle conforms to the fundamental interests of the
Chinese people and the foreign investors in Hong Kong as well."
</P>
<P>
Wu said, "We are delighted to see that the majority of Hong
Kong residents and the Hong Kong SAR government have full self-
confidence in administering Hong Kong well."
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa and the SAR government are
leading the Hong Kong people in carrying out the great practice of
"the Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong," which is
unprecedented historically, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wu pointed out that the general situation of both countries
must be taken into account in developing the Sino-British
relations.
</P>
<P>
"Years of work experience told us that progress and
achievements can be made on the basis of taking into account
bilateral relations," he said. "JLG's work has not only enhanced
the mutual understanding and cooperation, but also paved the way
for the further development of the Sino-British relations."
</P>
<P>
Wu expressed the belief that the Sino-British relations will
further progress after the successful visit of President Jiang
Zemin to Britain.
</P>
<P>
Alan Paul, British senior representative, said he is proud of
the accomplishment of the historic mission.
</P>
<P>
"I was encouraged by the smooth transition of July 1, 1997. And
now two and a half years later, the overall picture is still a
positive one," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I remain optimistic about Hong Kong's future because I believe
these traditional values and principles which include the rule of
law and the independence of judiciary are deeply rooted here.
</P>
<P>
"In the years to come, it is essential for the people and the
institutions of Hong Kong to work together to ensure these remain
the case," he said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Remove Oil Subsidy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
decided to phase-out subsidy on petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
President Olusegun Obasanjo said that the present subsidy was
responsible for the endemic corruption in the country and mostly
benefited the rich and affluent, according to a New Nigerian
report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The president told members of the House of Representatives
Committee on Petroleum Resources on Tuesday in Abuja that the
subsidy removal and deregulation of petroleum sector would result
in price increase of petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
Mindful of adverse effect on the general public, Obasanjo said,
the government would opt for a phased removal of the subsidy,
adding that the ordinary Nigerians would ultimately benefit from a
deregulated petroleum market.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the end of government's monopoly in refining,
import and distribution of petroleum products would ensure that
Nigeria, which is a major oil-producing country in the world,
never return to the dark days of petroleum scarcity.
</P>
<P>
The government would spend money saved from the subsidy removal
on the Universal Basic Education program, providing electricity
and potable water to ordinary Nigerians.

SEOUL, December 7 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-
jung Wednesday expressed the hope that his country and Chinese
Hong Kong will further cooperation to seek common prosperity
oriented toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Kim made the remarks when he met visiting Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region Chief Tung Cheehwa, who arrived here Tuesday
afternoon for an official two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Kim pointed out that one third of foreign
investments in South Korea are from Hong Kong and they have played
an important role in the recovering process of the South Korean
economy.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that both Hong Kong and South Korea, whose economies
are recovering after the financial crisis in Asia, should learn
from each other and Hong Kong will further cooperate with South
Korea in tourism, investment and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday afternoon, South Korean Foreign Affairs and Trade
Minister Hong Soon-young held talks with Tung, discussing ways to
increase economic cooperation, including the establishment of a
financial cooperation channel to cope effectively with a possible
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
It is Tung's first visit to South Korea since he became the

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Won Soars to Two-year High Against U.S. Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean won soared to a
two-year high against the U.S. dollar Wednesday amid an oversupply
of dollars, breaking the 1,130-won-per dollar level.
</P>
<P>
The won, which opened today at 1,139.50 won against one U.S.
dollar closed at 1,126.50 won, up nearly 13 won from yesterday.
</P>
<P>
It was the highest level since December 4, 1997 when the South
Korean currency changed hands at 1,135 won per dollar due to a
financial crisis triggered by corporate failures and bad loans of
financial institutions which began plaguing the country.
</P>
<P>
The won would continue to strengthen amid a glut of dollars
caused the won's surge against the greenback, said traders.
</P>
<P>
In afternoon trading, state-run banks intervened in the market
and bought dollars but failed to rein in the galloping Korean
currency, they said.
</P>
<P>
However, Kim Yong-duk, director for international finance of
the Ministry of Finance and Economy, said the current pace and
level of the won's gain against the greenback is not desirable and
local firms and financial institutions are likely to buy about
five billion dollars this month, striking a supply-demand balance.
</P>
<P>
Domestic financial institutions are expected to buy 1.5 billion
dollars to make provisions for soaring foreign currency loans
while the Korea Asset Management Corp. is to buy an estimated 500
million nonperforming foreign currency loans from financial
institutions, he said.
</P>
<P>
State-run and private companies are likely to buy around one
billion dollars to pay off their foreign debts, and local
financial institutions are estimated to take over two billion
dollars from foreign creditors of the Daewoo Group, Kim said.
</P>
<P>
The director added that market expectations for the continued
won's strength stems from a misunderstanding about the supply-
demand situation.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Barak to Meet Over Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak may
be meeting in the near future in an attempt to overcome the
current crises between the two sides, the Palestinian daily "Al
Qods" reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Barak's spokesman as saying that "Barak
and Chairman Arafat will meet shortly." He declined to define the
date or venue of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made in the wake of the decision taken by
Palestinian negotiators Monday to suspend talks with the Israeli
side in protest against continuing Jewish settlement activity.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also hit a snag over the map of the second
Israeli withdrawal from 5 percent of the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli daily "Maariv" reported Tuesday that Arafat
and Barak will meet next Monday and will issue a joint communique.
</P>
<P>
"Maariv" added that the two leaders intend to reach "important
decisions," which are preparatory to an agreement on the framework
of the final status negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders have had seven such meetings, including two
unannounced secret ones in Tel Aviv, ever since Barak took office
last July.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here indicate that the resolution of the
most thorny issues in the final status talks, like Palestinian
statehood, Jerusalem, water and refugees, may depend on the secret
channel established by the two leaders.

LONDON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Baroness Thatcher Tuesday night fiercely attacked plans for
a European defense structure, saying it would threaten NATO and
could help to create a European super-state.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The City of London has not been disadvantaged by the UK's
failure to join the euro and has prospered since the currency's

</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:

</P>

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Daily Slams U.S. Motive Behind British </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 8 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi daily on Wednesday
slammed the United States' objective in pushing for the adoption
by the U.N. Security Council of a British proposal on Iraq, saying
the Iraq issue has been used to serve the coming U.S. presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
Ath-Thawra, organ of the ruling Arab Baath Socialist Party
termed the British proposal as "a filthy game the
U.S. administration tries to play with after its anti-Iraq hostile
policy has failed."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have recently been urging the Security
Council to adopt a British draft resolution calling for the return
of United Nations weapons inspectors to Iraq in exchange for a
suspension of sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the U.S. administration's goal behind this
draft is to mislead the Arab and world public opinions and absorb
their resentment against the continuation of the "criminal
embargo."
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has repeatedly declared that it will reject the British
proposal which it argues will not lead to the lifting, or
suspension, of the nine-year-old sanctions, but will impose new
conditions and restrictions on Iraq instead.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Iraq is demanding that the sanctions imposed on it
following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait be lifted unconditionally,
insisting that all its banned weapons of mass destruction have
already been eliminated.
</P>
<P>
"Any resolution that does not win Iraq's approval will come
stillborn and Iraq will resist all aggressive schemes and designs
against it," said the Iraqi daily.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Works to Make Cleaning Industry More Productive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Singapore has launched a
transformation plan to pool efforts to elevate the productivity
and professionalism of the cleaning industry.
</P>
<P>
Officiating at the opening ceremony of the "Cleaning in the New
Millennium" Trade and Recruit Fair here Wednesday, Singapore
Minister of Manpower Lee Boon Yang said his ministry, the
Environmental Management Association of Singapore (EMAS) and the
Productivity and Standards Board (PSB), together with cleaning
service providers, building owners and suppliers, have jointly
developed the Cleaning Industry Transformation Plan which is
designed to address the major issues plaguing the sector from an
industry-wide basis and in an integrated manner.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the plan comprises three key initiatives, namely the
development of a set of performance standards by which cleaning
tasks can be specified and evaluated, the development of national
standards for the cleaning workforce by which a national framework
is provided to assess job skills and competencies, and the setting-
up of a dedicated training center for the cleaning industry which
will serve as a focal point for expertise in cleaning technology
and play a key role in the upgrading of skills and knowledge for
the industry.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the cleaning industry makes a significant contribution
not only to the Singapore economy but also affects the lifestyle
and well-being of the people as well. He estimated the cleaning
industry's market value at 300 million Singapore dollars a year in
Singapore and its growth potential at 27 percent over the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
"Singapore's reputation as a Clean and Green City is due in no
small part to the effort and diligence of our cleaning workers,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Lee noted that the cleaning industry has a productivity level
only about a fifth of the national average and is plagued by low
productivity as many other domestic service industries. He said
the resulting low productivity leads to poor work conditions and
wages, lack of interest by Singaporeans to take on these jobs and
consequent demands for more low-skilled foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that a trend is already emerging which indicates
that the service industry is becoming more prominent in the
knowledge economy. He drew attention to the fact that the
employment share of the manufacturing sector in Singapore has been
declining steadily from 27 percent in 1993 to 21.6 percent in 1998
while two other sectors, financial and business services and
community and personal services, have increased their combined
employment share from 32.5 percent in 1993 to 38.1 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the transformation process has already started with an
aim to improve productivity through investment in the training and
development of their staff, through automation and mechanization
and through the introduction of best practices.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland to Support Ailing Tourism Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss parliament has decided
to support the ailing tourism industry with 190 million Swiss
francs (122 million U.S. dollars) over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the parliament's decision Tuesday, Swiss
Economics Minister Pascal Couchepin expressed the hope that the
financial injection would have an important ripple effect and
would also boost tourism-related industries. He stressed that the
government support was vital as the tourist industry could not
afford to lose any more market share.
</P>
<P>
The Switzerland Tourism organization, a key player in marketing
Switzerland's tourist attractions, is co-financed by the
government and the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss tourism industry has been on a worrying downhill
slide since the first half of the 1990s. Between 1990 and 1996,
overnight stays dropped by up to 5 percent. A UBS bank spokesman
told a Swiss newspaper in an interview three days ago that the
tourism sector was deeply in the red. He said debts currently
stood at about 20 billion francs (13 billion dollars).

PYONGYANG, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's

However, the spokesman added that his country will not tolerate
any policy which is aimed at disarming and changing the DPRK.

<HEADLINE> Renovation of "Pompeii in the Desert" in Western China Completed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- China has just completed
renovation of the ruins of the ancient Kingdom of Kroraina (Loulan)
, which locals call "China's Pompeii in the desert," comparing it
to the Italian town buried under volcanic ash nearly 2,000 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
The ancient kingdom is located on the eastern tip of the
Taklimakan Desert in the southern part of northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. According to historical records,
it used to be a famous booming city at the juncture of the
southern and northern routes of the ancient Silk Road some 2,000
years ago. Because of diminishing water resources, the city was
gradually ruined and abandoned.
</P>
<P>
This was the first renovation of the 2,000-year-old city since
it was discovered by a Swedish archeologist in 1900, and the work
was based on careful researches conducted last year which led to a
thorough repair plan.
</P>
<P>
The project took about 20 days to complete and cost 400,000
yuan (48,000 US dollars), said Wang Jinhua, a senior engineer in
charge of the renovation.
</P>
<P>
"We have achieved the designed effect to create something "
solid in structure and primitive in looks," he added.
</P>
<P>
Major structures under repair included a Buddhist pagoda made
of adobe and wood and a relic known as the "Three Houses," a
symbol of the Kingdom of Kroraina. These served as the sacrificial
altar and residential area of administrative officials in ancient
times.
</P>
<P>
The ancient city walls of Kroraina are an example of the
Peacock River culture, which boasts a history of at least 4,700
years. Beaten by high winds and sandstorms for centuries, the
foundation of the "Three Houses" was eroded.

The roof of the 10.4-meter-high pagoda, the largest Kroraina
building, was cracked and caved in and its wood rotted.
</P>
<P>
An engineering team of more than 20 builders from Beijing and
Xinjiang repaired the pagoda and the "Three Houses" using the
adobe sun-dried mud bricks. In an effort to prevent water from
permeating the structure, workers dug earth and made the bricks at
a place some two kilometers from Kroraina.

"This renovation project sets an example for the repair of
ancient cities in the desert, and the experience gained will be
useful in renovating 20 more historical sites in the depth of vast
desert of Xinjiang," said Yue Feng, an archeologist at the

<HEADLINE> Water Shortage Continues in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Although reservoir levels have
doubled those of December 8, 1998, water shortage continues in
Cyprus, the Cyprus Mail newspaper reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As of Tuesday, Cyprus had 29.2 million cubic meters of water
behind its dams, only 10.7 percent of the total storage capacity
for the island's dams.
</P>
<P>
The total water reserve for the island was a mere 14.3 million
cubic meters one year ago, or 5.2 percent of the reservoirs'
storage capacity.
</P>
<P>
However, the October-November period this year was "the seventh
driest two-month period of the century," said Klitos Piyiotis, a
senior superintendent at the Meteorological Service.
</P>
<P>
During the first two months of the current meteorological year
(from October to the following September 30), normal average
rainfall on the island is about 86 millimeters, he said.
</P>
<P>
But during October and November this year, an average of only

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-British Joint
Liaison Group (JLG) concluded the 47th meeting here Wednesday,
thus bringing to a successful end of its historic mission.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting, the last of the group,
representatives of both China and Britain reviewed the work of the
JLG since its establishment in May 1985 and discussed matters of
common concern as well as Hong Kong's future under the "one
country, two systems" principle.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-British JLG will be dismissed on January 1,2000 in
accordance with the Joint Declaration between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a media briefing after the meeting, Wu Hongbo,
Chinese senior representative, said the JLG has accomplished its
historic mission entrusted by the two governments.
</P>
<P>
"The implementation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration is a
challenging and unprecedented job. Many of the questions that the
JLG handled have never cropped up in the field of the
international law nor international practices. However we
successfully resolved these questions through cooperation," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Wu said China and Britain share the common interests of
maintaining Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability on the
basis of the Joint Declaration although they have different
concepts of values and ways of handling issues.
</P>
<P>
That's why both sides are able to cooperate with each other and
solve one question after another and make due contribution to the
smooth transition and transfer of power in Hong Kong, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Wu pointed out that the "one country, two systems" principle is
the key to the solution of the question of Hong Kong as well as to
the insurance of its long-term prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
The work of the Sino-British JLG has proved this point, post-
handover Hong Kong has proved this point and Macao which will
return to the motherland will further demonstrate this point, he
said.

</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):

Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- Since the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has sought
to suspend the execution of death sentence of the outlawed
Kurdistan Workers' Party leader Abdullah Ocalan and Turkey is
ready to heed the decision of the ECHR, Turkish political parties
that were closed down or face the threat of banning also will view
the ECHR as a last resort.
</P>
<P>
Whether the Ocalan case will set a legal precedent remains a

...demonstrate this point, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wu said facts in the past 15 years show that the determination
of the Chinese side in implementing the Joint Declaration has
remained unchanged and that its efforts in implementing the "one
country, two systems" principle has never relaxed.
</P>
<P>
"We have neither reason nor necessity to change this principle
because the 'one country, two systems' is our fundamental state
policy and component of China's reunification cause," he stressed.
"The principle conforms to the fundamental interests of the
Chinese people and the foreign investors in Hong Kong as well."
</P>
<P>
Wu said, "We are delighted to see that the majority of Hong
Kong residents and the Hong Kong SAR government have full self-
confidence in administering Hong Kong well."
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa and the SAR government are
leading the Hong Kong people in carrying out the great practice of
"the Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong," which is
unprecedented historically, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wu pointed out that the general situation of both countries
must be taken into account in developing the Sino-British
relations.
</P>
<P>
"Years of work experience told us that progress and
achievements can be made on the basis of taking into account
bilateral relations," he said. "JLG's work has not only enhanced
the mutual understanding and cooperation, but also paved the way
for the further development of the Sino-British relations."
</P>
<P>
Wu expressed the belief that the Sino-British relations will
further progress after the successful visit of President Jiang
Zemin to Britain.
</P>
<P>
Alan Paul, British senior representative, said he is proud of
the accomplishment of the historic mission.

"I was encouraged by the smooth transition of July 1, 1997. And
now two and a half years later, the overall picture is still a
positive one," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I remain optimistic about Hong Kong's future because I believe
these traditional values and principles which include the rule of
law and the independence of judiciary are deeply rooted here.
</P>
<P>
"In the years to come, it is essential for the people and the
institutions of Hong Kong to work together to ensure these remain
the case," he said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Presses No Charges on Man In Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 8 (Xinhua) -- A 19-year-old man who fired
blank shots outside the Israeli Embassy in Amman two weeks ago
will soon be released without trial, the semi-official English
daily Jordan Times reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor general at the State Security Court decided not
to press any charges against the man on the basis that his action
did not constitute a crime, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The man, identified as Nabil Hassan Haj Mohammad, fired several
shots in close range at the police officers guarding the Israeli
embassy building on November 23, forcing the police to return
fire and lightly injured him on the right hand before arresting
him on the spot.
</P>
<P>
Police later found the man had fired blank shots with a fake
pistol.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, relatives of the Nabil said he was suffering from
severe mental disorder during the shooting incident, as he had
failed twice in high school exams.
</P>
<P>
Nabil, born in Palestinian territories and brought up in Oman,
had no political, fundamental or organizational affiliation, said
his brother Jihad Mohammad.
</P>
<P>
He fired at the policemen with the fake pistol in a bid to get
them killing him as he did not had the courage to commit suicide,
and he got the fake pistol from a sports goods shop, investigators
said.
</P>
<P>
The man was still under precautionary detention pending his
release.
</P>
<P>
The shooting incident aroused the attention of Israel, which
had send a team of security experts to Amman to join their
Jordanian counterparts in the investigations.
</P>
<P>
No lethal weapons were later found at the shooting site, nor on
Nabil himself, investigators said.

ANKARA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- A Maltese-registered tanker
carrying 45,753 tons of oil ran aground Monday at the mouth of the
Bosporus strait across Istanbul, the largest city in Turkey, the
Turkish Daily News reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Murat Zafer Cetintas, head of the Organization of Eco-Warriors
and the Environment, was quoted as saying that if necessary
precautions are not taken, the city will face serious problems.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held on the ship Yildiray, near the
grounded crude oil tanker Histria Sitayt in the Marmara exit of
the Bosporus, Cetintas also said the Maltese-flagged tanker had
run aground because of the southwest wind.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the authorities for not taking practical
precautions.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish coast guard said that there is no imminent danger
of an oil spill.
</P>
<P>
The 242 meter-long tanker, Histria Seatide, got stuck in the
Sea of Marmara just as it navigated to pass the narrow Bosporus
strait, the dividing line for both the city of Istanbul and for
Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
The tanker, sailing from Russia to Italy, did not immediately
request any help.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Cambodia Seeks Development With Political Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's coalition
government has scored remarkable achievements in both domestic and
foreign affairs one year after its formation.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Hun Sen said recently that the year 1999 "has
been the best year for Cambodia on many points," as the country
has achieved national reconciliation, political stability, smooth
economic development and people's happiness.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from the two ruling parties -- the Cambodian People's
Party (CPP) and the FUNCINPEC party -- spoke highly of the unity
and cooperation between them at a recent anniversary celebration
gathering.
</P>
<P>
"This is a great event in Khmer history to show that we love
and understand each other ... after a historical split, civil war
and unspeakable loss," said CPP President Chea Sim.
</P>
<P>
FUNCINPEC's President Prince Norodom Ranariddh called the
coalition "one great medicine to keep the people and the country
in peace, prosperity and happiness."
</P>
<P>
The year 1999 has also seen a complete end to civil war, and
true peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
After peace and stability returned to the country, the Royal
Government has been able to concentrate on its three key goals --
political stability, economic development and integration into the
international community. The situation in Cambodia now is far more
encouraging.
</P>
<P>
The most important success is that only a week after the new
government was established, Cambodia took back its seat at the
United Nations and by the end of April, Cambodia finally became a
full member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
And relations with donor countries and international organizations
are moving back toward normality.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the enhancement of its international status,
Cambodia has also actively taken part in regional affairs in its
effort to play a more important role in the region.
</P>
<P>
During the course of the year, the royal government has
strengthened relations with its important neighbors -- Vietnam,
Laos and Thailand. And Cambodia's relations with China have become
very friendly, as many senior government officials including Prime
Minister Hun Sen, Foreign Minister Hor Nam Hong and co-Ministers
of Defense Tea Banh and Prince Sisowath Sirirath have made good-
will visits to China.
</P>
<P>
What is more important is that Cambodia has taken concrete
steps in reforms that are starting to yield results. The reforms
involve forest management, taxation, civil service, the armed
forces and the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
As an "economic government" named by Prime Minister Hun Sen,
Cambodia has achieved remarkable growth after a dramatic drop in
1997 and 1998. It is expected that real GDP growth in 1999 would
be at least four percent while in 1997 and 1998 it was a mere one
percent.
</P>
<P>
Despite its fragile economy, the macro-economic situation in
Cambodia remains stable. Inflation is expected to drop from 12.5
percent to just six percent and the exchange rate is fairly stable.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the value-added tax (VAT) has increased
the nation's tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
All in all, as Hun Sen put it: "The total economic situation in
Cambodia is not very good nor very bad."
</P>
<P>
The government has also made successes in curbing illegal
logging, cutting civil-service jobs and reducing poverty from 39
percent in 1993-94 to 36 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government has taken drastic measures to crack
down on illegal possession of weapons. As of late September, the
number of various confiscated and voluntarily turned weapons had
reached to more than 60,000, of which more than 20,000 were
destroyed by the government.
</P>
<P>
However, the country is still beset by many problems which are
causing domestic insecurity, including thefts, armed robberies and
kidnappings, deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior Sar
Kheng acknowledged recently.
</P>
<P>
And widespread poverty, food shortages, poor infrastructure and
corruption are hindering the nation's further development and
eroding foreign investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
Riding on its achievements, the Royal Government is determined
to press ahead with its reform efforts to put Cambodia on a track
of sustainable development and growth in order to catch up with
the richer countries of ASEAN as well as to join the ASEAN Free
Trade Area.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Hun Sen has already outlined his government's
main strategy in four areas the future -- development of
agriculture, communications, electricity and energy and human
resources.

<HEADLINE> Man behind Premium Ticket Scheme Leaves SOCOG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Paul Reading, general manager
of the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG)
and the man behind the controversial premium ticket scheme, left
the SOCOG on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A SOCOG spokesman confirmed in Sydney that Reading was no
longer at the committee but would not say whether he had quit or
was sacked.
</P>
<P>
SOCOG's new deputy chief executive Michael Eyers will assume
Reading's responsibilities for the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Reading has borne the brunt of criticism for the ticketing
debacle after it was revealed in October that he had put aside 840,
000 of the best tickets to the 2000 Games for possible use in the
premium scheme for sponsors and the rich.
</P>
<P>
The SOCOG board claimed Reading set aside the tickets without
its approval.
</P>
<P>
The board then voted to cap the premium program at 325,000
tickets, with more than a half million tickets returned to the
public ballot.
</P>
<P>
Reading's position with SOCOG was downgraded last month after
an internal review slammed the entire ticketing process.
</P>
<P>
He was stripped of responsibility for ticketing and finance and
was in charge of only the marketing and hospitality programs.
</P>
<P>
SOCOG chief executive Sandy Hollway sent an internal memo to
staff Wednesday morning, informing them that Reading would be
leaving SOCOG "effective today".
</P>
<P>
He thanked Reading for a "substantial contribution" to the
SOCOG.

<HEADLINE> China Refutes U.S. Charges on Religious Affairs (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua)-- China's religious study
institute released a long article here today to refute the United
States government's unfair charges against the country's religious
affairs.
</P>
<P>
The China section of the U.S. State Department's "Annual Report
on International Religious Freedom for 1999" distorts facts and
harbors ulterior motives, said the article from the Chinese
Religious Studies Center.
</P>
<P>
The report, issued by the U.S. State Department in September,
irresponsibly commented on religious affairs in many countries.
</P>
<P>
A month later, the U.S. Congress held hearings on the subject
and listed China and several other countries as countries for "
special concern" and impose sanctions against these countries.
</P>
<P>
"Leaving aside the question of whether the United States has
the right to interfere with the domestic affairs of other
countries according to its domestic laws, let's first have an
analysis of what a trash the report is", the article said.
</P>
<P>
The report has presented its arguments from a biased viewpoint
and never broken free of its traditional thinking of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
With pre-conceived prejudice, the report held that there exists
no religious freedom in China.
</P>
<P>
It reasoned that since China is a country ruled by the
Communists, China could not possibly allow religious freedom since
Communists are atheists, and that the Chinese government could
only confine and control the development of religions.
</P>
<P>
Proceeding from this, the report tried all it could, even went
so far as to resort to fact-distorting and fabrication, to attain
the so-called "facts" for its wrong arguments, the article said. (

<TEXT>
<P>
Not even the authors of the report could offer a satisfactory
explanation as to why in China, a country ruled by so-called "
autocrats and dictators," the number of religious believers has
expanded so quickly, showing more vitality than in Europe and
North American which claim to "fully embrace religious freedom."
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, the U.S. government report had to admit that in
China the number of religious believers has continued to rise and
that in some places had encountered no interference from the
government.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Communist Party of China has always respected and
protected religious freedom in the country. Even the Chinese
Soviet Areas of the 1930s and the Liberated Areas of the 1940s
pursued a policy of religious freedom, the article noted.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of New China 50 years ago, the Central
Government has enthusiastically enforced full protection of its
citizens' rights of religious freedom, which have been explicitly
stipulated in its laws including the Constitution, the Criminal
Law and the law on the autonomy of ethnic regions. Relevant laws
have also been adopted to penalize behavior encroaching upon the
Chinese citizens' right to religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department report claimed that it knew of no
Chinese public servant who had been punished for interfering with
citizens' religious freedom. "We are not sure whether the authors
are really ignorant and ill-informed or just pretending not to
know," the article said.
</P>
<P>
The severe punishment of the Sichuan Pictorial Publishing House
and its counterparts in 1993 should have fully demonstrated the
solemnity of the Chinese laws and the sincerity of the Chinese
government in protecting the freedom of religion, it noted.

<P>
In recent years, the Chinese government has signed a series of
major world conventions on human rights and enacted relevant laws
and regulations to implement these conventions.
</P>
<P>
It has also enthusiastically supported the participation of
religious believers in governmental affairs.
</P>
<P>
So far, over 17,000 of these believers have been admitted into
the People's Congresses and the People's Political Consultative
Conferences at all levels.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government's policy of freedom of religious belief
has been both sincere and successful, the article stressed.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics show that at present China has over 100
million religious believers, 85,000 places for religious
activities, 300,000 religious workers, and 3,000 religious groups.
Religious groups have also established 74 religious schools and
universities.
</P>
<P>
The article noted that in China, there are 13,000 Buddhist
temples with 200,000 monks and nuns, of which 120,000 are lamas
and nuns of Tibetan Buddhism, and over 1,500 Taoist temples with
25,000 followers, more than 30,000 Islamic mosques with 18 million
believers, and 12,000 churches with about 10 million Christians.
</P>
<P>
China's religious groups handle their own affairs, manage their
own educational institutes, publish their own religious books and
magazines, and sponsor their own social welfare activities.
</P>
<P>
The rights of religious workers and religious believers are
fully protected by law and no interference in their affairs is
tolerated, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Because of these efforts, many candid and fair observers have
expressed the view that China's policy of religious freedom is
being enforced with more vigor now than ever before.

<P>
However, the authors of the report continue to blind their eyes
from this widely held conclusion and the basic facts, and spread
the nonsense that the Chinese government limits religious freedom
and practices "religious prosecution."
</P>
<P>
The report also distorts facts and fabricates lies in order to
deceive and mislead the public, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, in his meeting with U.S.
Christian leaders in November, 1997, noted that despite all the
differences between the two countries, the basic facts should not
be distorted.
</P>
<P>
"A small number of people in the U.S. are making noises on the
so-called Chinese religious issue. However, the facts should not
be overwhelmed by the noises," Jiang said at the time.
</P>
<P>
The article noted that since the establishment of Sino-U.S.
diplomatic relations, many U.S. government leaders, Congressmen,
and religious figures have visited China and its places of worship.
</P>
<P>
People at the U.S. State Department should be better informed
on religious festivals in China, since they do maintain an embassy
here.
</P>
<P>
Taoism originated in China and Buddhism has been in the country
for over 2,000 years and was long ago incorporated into
traditional Chinese culture.
</P>
<P>
Though relatively new, both Protestant and Catholic
Christianity have developed strongly here since the founding of
New China.
</P>
<P>
Some people in the U.S. speak of "prosecuted Christians," and
this has hindered their ability to acquire an in-depth
understanding of religious affairs in China, the article noted. (

The fact is that Christianity, rather than being prosecuted,
has seen its fastest development in China. First introduced into
the country in 1807, it had only 740,000 followers over its first
140 years in China, up to the time New China was established in
1949.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. report admitted that at present China has 10 to 15
million Christians, 12,000 churches, and over 250,000 meeting
places.
</P>
<P>
Even if Chinese Christians now number only 10 million, this
would mean a 15-fold increase in their number in just 50 years. Is
there any other place in the world that can match this rate?
</P>
<P>
Christian churches in China have also witnessed the fastest
development. In the early 1980s, there were only three churches
that were open to the public.
</P>
<P>
Now, this number has jumped to 12,000; and every three days
there are two more new Christian churches opened to public across
the country. While in the U.S., the situation is just the contrary.
</P>
<P>
China also turns out more Bibles than anywhere else in the
world. From 1980 to 1998, a total of 20 million Bibles were
printed by the China Christian Council, whose prominence in this
respect has never been challenged by any other publisher in the
world.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Christians in China have established 17
theological seminaries here, and their publication "Tianfeng"
boasts the largest circulation of any religious magazines in China.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to know whether "limits" and "prosecutions"
could possibly result in all the above-mentioned achievements and
facts," the article asked.

The U.S. government report also leveled charges against China
on some specific issues, including the registration of religious
places, the protection of ethnic culture and tradition, the
reincarnation of the Panchen Lama, and the crackdown on evil cults.
</P>
<P>
Registering social groups is a practice adopted by many
countries, so that these groups can be legally recognized to
shoulder their duties and attain full legal protection.
</P>
<P>
"This is also in line with social development and conducive to
the healthy development of the society," the article noted.
</P>
<P>
The article pointed out that, ostensibly, the United States
does not require social groups to be registered. But its tax
agencies designate and monitor those social groups that enjoy tax
breaks and other benefits. "This, in essence, is the same as
registration."
</P>
<P>
The article said that in such a vast country as China where
religious believers account for only a small part, it is all the
more necessary to have religious groups registered in order to
protect their interests and religious activities.
</P>
<P>
"China's religious circles have also expressed their sincere
support of this policy," the article said.

<HEADLINE> 17 Dead in Plane Crash in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- All the 17 people aboard a twin-
engine Asian Spirit plane were found dead on Wednesday, one day
after the plane went missing Tuesday morning in the northern
Philippines,aviation authority said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Jacinto Ortega, chief of the Air Transportation Office, said a
Briton and a Japanese were among the fatalities.
</P>
<P>
According to Asian Spirit spokeswoman Nanette Tero, rescuers
located the Asian Spirit plane late Tuesday in Nueva Vizcaya
Province in the northern Philippines and recovered all the bodies
by early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tero said the rescue team found the wreckage after local
villagers reported a crash nearby.
</P>
<P>
The LET-410 plane, with 15 passengers and two crew members on
board, took off from Manila on Tuesday morning and was scheduled
to arrive at the northern town of Cauayan, Isabela Province, about
one hour later.
</P>
<P>
At 09:19 (1:19 GMT) on Tuesday, the flight called up Cauayan
airport stating that it was 96 kilometers out of Manila and they
would arrive at Cauayan at 09:37 (01:37 GMT). That was the last
message and contact.
</P>
<P>
The authorities have yet to determine the cause of the tragedy
although initial report said the wreckage looked like the plane
had burned.
</P>
<P>
Tero said this was the first incident involving the airline
since it launched its operations in 1996. The airline specializes
in low-volume domestic routes and operates nine planes with the
LET-410 as its workhorse.

NAIROBI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's inflation rate is on

The bank's chief economist Maurice Kanga said Tuesday that the

<P>
In the past few years, rapid economic growth and social
development has given rise to ideological changes for some people.
</P>
<P>
Some cults, in the name of religion, took advantage of people's
perplexity, usurped religious concepts, and used illegal
psychological manipulation to control the minds of a small number
of people.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the physical and psychological health, and even
the personnel security, of these people was endangered.
</P>
<P>
As long as these cults had a number of followers, they were
used as pawns to exert pressure on the government and challenge
social traditions, further endangering the society and the people.
</P>
<P>
The article said this is a serious problem encountered by
governments of all countries, including the United States and
China, and solving this problem requires concerted efforts among
governments worldwide.
</P>
<P>
People in many countries bitterly hate these cults, and no
country allows them to rampage, so governments adopt various
measures to prevent cults from endangering social security and the
lives and property of the people.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that many European countries have attached
great importance to this problem, and the United States has
established quite a number of anti-cult organizations.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, some cults appeared in China in the name
of religion. Falun Gong, banned by the Chinese government earlier
this year, was a typical cult which attempted to endanger social
security and the physical and psychological health of the people
in the name of religion.
</P>
<P>
The ban imposed by the Chinese government has not only helped
maintain the security of the lives and property of the people and
social stability, but has also won support from religious circles,
especially from the followers of Buddhism.

<HEADLINE> History of Macao Seen Through 100 Years Of Gongbei Customs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 8 (Xinhua) -- At Gongbei Customs in the
city of Zhuhai in south China's Guangdong Province, it now takes
one only a few seconds to check through any of the 66 customs
channels.
</P>
<P>
Liu Hao, director of Gongbei Customs, said customs in Zhuhai
has experienced great development in the past two decades. People
leaving for Macao and coming to China has increased from less than
600,000 in 1978 to 29.26 million in 1998, with the import and
export of goods up from 460,000 tons in 1978 to 21 million tons in
1998. Gongbei Customs currently has the largest flow of people
passing through its checkpoints after Luohu Customs in Shenzhen,
said Liu.
</P>
<P>
Every morning, hundreds of tons of fresh food and sea produce
are transported from neighboring Zhuhai and Zhongshan to Macao.
Products sent from China to Macao include gas, mineral water,
fresh flowers, furniture, textiles, garments, machinery equipment
and building materials.
</P>
<P>
Apart from visiting relatives living in China's interior areas,
residents of Macao passing through customs also come to the
interior on business.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, imports and exports with Macao reported 545 million US
dollars, accounting for 62 percent of China's total Macao import
and export trade.
</P>
<P>
According to local labor bureau, Zhuhai has more than 10,000
professionals working in a wide range of fields in Macao, making
due contributions to Macao's development.
</P>
<P>
Macao business people have conducted a total of 1,798
investment projects in Zhuhai, 33.3 percent of the city's total
overseas-funded projects.

<HEADLINE> China Refutes U.S. Charges on Religious Affairs (8) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A small number of people in the U.S. administration and
Congress made fuss about the ban and accused the Chinese
government of abusing human rights.
</P>
<P>
Would these people be satisfied if the Chinese government
allowed cults to endanger lives and social security?
</P>
<P>
Cults such as the "People's Temple" and a sect led by David
Koresh brought serious damage to the U.S. administration and
people, so do these critics in the U.S. think the people of China
should suffer a repetition of these tragedies?
</P>
<P>
The U.S. report again raised the so-called issue of "prisoners
of conscience" and said that China has been confining these "
prisoners of conscience" for their religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
The report cited several "individual cases" including Xu Yongze
and Su Zhimin, in an effort to prove that China is engaging in "
religious persecution."
</P>
<P>
In fact, the article said, China did not arrest anyone for
their religious belief, and Xu Yongze was a person devoid of
common religion knowledge and basic theological accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
U.S. politicians should better think of their reputations
before they use such examples to serve their political interest.
</P>
<P>
For a government report from a major power, the U.S. report is
filled with contradictions. It cites sentences and words from
short reports and rumors to make groundless accusations stemming
also from their rich imaginations.
</P>
<P>
The article said the U.S. report not only reflects a
bureaucratic work style and an extremely irresponsible attitude in
the U.S. administration and Congress, but also indicates big-power
hegemonism on the part of the U.S. administration.
</P>
<P>
This extremely irresponsible report will ultimately harm the
existing good relations between China and the U.S., and surely
endanger the long-term interest of the U.S. itself, the article
concludes.

<HEADLINE> UAE Oil Privatization Not on Agenda: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) has said the UAE government has no plan
to privatize the country's oil sector.
</P>
<P>
"Privatization of the UAE oil sector is not on the government's
agenda at the moment," said Minister of Finance and Industry
Sheikh Hamdan Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, quoted by the Khaleej Times
daily on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The official made the statement on Tuesday after inaugurating
a condensate processing plant in the Jebel Ali Free Zone in Dubai.
</P>
<P>
The plant, built at a cost of 350 million U.S. dollars by
Emirates National Oil Company, has a daily production capacity of
120,000 barrels of refined and distilled downstream products.
</P>
<P>
He said that around 60 percent of the diesel, marine diesel and
derivatives produced will be exported.
</P>
<P>
As a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC), the UAE's confirmed recoverable reserves of
crude oil stand at 98 billion barrels, or 9.5 percent of global
reserves.
</P>
<P>
The country's oil production is currently around 2 million
barrels per day in line with the March agreement of the OPEC,
which was aimed at saving oil prices by curbing output.
</P>
<P>
The agreement has been successful in lifting oil prices from
less than 10 dollars per barrel early this year to a record high
of 25 dollars per barrel in November.
</P>
<P>
The UAE's oil revenues could reach about 19.9 billion dollars
this year, contributing some 40 percent to a gross domestic
product of 49.8 billion dollars, according to official estimates.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the Gulf country's oil revenues totaled 10.1 billion
dollars, accounting for about 21.8 percent in the gross domestic
product of 46.4 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Chinese CPPCC Chairman Arrives in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), arrived here Wednesday morning for an official
good-will visit at the invitation of the Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
This is Li's first trip to Japan and the last leg of his
ongoing three-nation Asia tour which has already taken him to Sri
Lanka and Maldives.
</P>
<P>
Li and his party were greeted at the airport by Chinese
Ambassador to Japan Chen Jian and senior officials from the
Japanese Foreign Ministry as well as representatives of Chinese
Japanese and overseas Chinese.
</P>
<P>
In his statement upon arrival at the airport, Li said that
China, the biggest developing country, and Japan, a big economic
power in the world, are neighbors separated by a strip of water.
The development of friendly and cooperative partnership devoting
to peace and development in the coming century is in the
fundamental interests of the two peoples and will benefit peace,
stability and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region and the world
at large.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that the aim of his current visit is to conduct
extensive contact with people of various circles and exchange
views on bilateral relations and other issues of common concern,
so as to enhance mutual understanding, expand common

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Wins FIFA Fair Play Award for 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand has been
attributed with the FIFA Fair Play Award for 1999, according to a
press release issued Wednesday by NewsRoom, New Zealand premier
Internet news agency based in Wellington.
</P>
<P>
The FIFA Committee for Security and Fair Play, meeting in Tokyo
under Chairman Dr. Antonio Matarrese (Italy), decided to give the
Award to the entire New Zealand footfall community for its efforts
during 1999, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand was the host to a very successful FIFA Under-17
World Championship in November, which helped promote the game in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The press release quoted Dr. Matarrese as saying that the award
to New Zealand "is really aimed at everyone involved in football
there."
</P>
<P>
"New Zealand is known as a sports-mad country, and we realize
that football is not the number one sport. But the way in which
the people supported the Under-17 finals, despite the elimination
of their own team in the first round, was a great example to fans
in other countries. The Under-17 organizers in Auckland,
Christchurch,Napier and Dunedin found the right way to capture the
spirit of the competition and to promote the tournament properly,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to congratulate the whole New Zealand football
community," said FIFA President Joseph S. Blatter.
</P>
<P>
"Building football in some countries where it is not the
national sport requires a joint effort," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The FIFA Fair Play Award will be presented to New Zealand
during the annual World Player Gala Evening in Brussels on January
24 next year.

<HEADLINE> HK Not City Just About Money, Says Anson Chan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Acting Chief Executive of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Anson Chan Wednesday urged
recognition of Hong Kong's role as a cultural hub as well as a
financial hub at the opening ceremony of the Third Conference of
Asian Foundations &AMP; Organizations.
</P>
<P>
"I understand that the choice (of convening the meeting in Hong
Kong) was made in recognition of Hong Kong's role as an
international financial and cultural hub," Chan said.
</P>
<P>
"But I have to say that there are still some people in Hong
Kong who need to recognize that this city is not just about money,
and that the quality of our city depends on a lot more than just
finance," she said.
</P>
<P>
Chan said the role of Hong Kong as a financial hub has long
been recognized, so much that some have said that Hong Kong is
just an economic city.
</P>
<P>
"That has never been entirely true, and with each passing year
as education has spread, as our contacts with other places have
deepened, and as our confidence in our own society has developed,
this city's part in the world's cultural growth and cultural
exchange and experiment has expanded. And I welcome your
recognition of that role," she said.
</P>
<P>
Chan said that deepening understanding throughout Hong Kong's
society that the future of Hong Kong as a financial and cultural
hub depends upon the quality of environment is one of the most
important tasks for this city as it enters the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The conference will discuss environment and sustainable
development, the role of civil society in promoting the standard
of living of people in the region and cultural cooperation and
exchange.

WASHINGTON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton

<P>
JAKARTA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Karate-Do
Federation (Forki) announced plans to establish a centralized
training center to prepare national karatekas for the 2001
Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
Forki secretary-general Hendardji Soepandji said the
centralized training center would select participants after the
15th National Games in June 2000, because Forki wanted to search
for junior karatekas during the Games.
</P>
<P>
The federation would also search for talented karatekas from
the biennial Kasad (Army's Chief of Staff) Cup scheduled for
August 2000.
</P>
<P>
"The karatekas are currently preparing in their respective
areas.We will send our talent scouts to seek out young karatekas
who are below 15 years of age in a series of national
championships next year," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post
Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The young karatekas will join the training center for the 2001
SEA Games, which will start after the National Games," he added.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia finished fifth with three silvers and bronzes each in
the two-day competition which was attended by 25 Asian countries
recently. It medal tall did not measure up to its achievement two
years ago when at the same event it earned two golds in the women'

<HEADLINE> China Refutes U.S. Charges on Religious Freedom (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua)-- China's religious study
institute released an article here today refuting the United
States government's unfair charges against the country's religious
affairs policies.
</P>
<P>
The China section of the U.S. State Department's "Annual Report
on International Religious Freedom for 1999" distorts facts and
harbors ulterior motives, said the article issued by the Chinese
Religious Studies Center.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department report released in September
irresponsibly commented on religious affairs in many countries.
</P>
<P>
A month later, the U.S. Congress held hearings on the subject
and listed China and several other countries as those warranting "
special concern," and recommended imposing sanctions against them.
</P>
<P>
"The report presented its arguments from a biased viewpoint and
never broken free of its yoke of Cold War mentality," the article
said.
</P>
<P>
With pre-conceived prejudice, the report held that no religious
freedom exists in China.
</P>
<P>
It reasoned that since China is a country ruled by the
Communists, China could not possibly allow religious freedom since
Communists are atheists, and so the Chinese government can only
confine and control the development of religion.
</P>
<P>
Starting from this premise, the report went so far as to
distort facts and create fabrications to prop up its misguided
arguments, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Communist Party has always paid great attention to
respecting and protecting religious freedom in the country, the
article noted.
</P>
<P>
China's policy of freedom of religious belief has been both
sincere and successful, it said.

<HEADLINE> Albright Holds Lengthy Talks with Assad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright Tuesday afternoon held lengthy talks with
Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad on ways of reaching a formula for
the resumption of the stalled Syrian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin who is accompanying
Albright in the Mideast tour told reporters "there is nothing new
to raise our optimism." The resumption of the Syrian-Israeli
talks, which broke down three years ago, does not seem near, he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said Albright believed it was possible to reach a
formula for the resumption of the talks on the return of the Golan
Heights Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Albright's talks in Syria and Israel focus mainly on
four issues - the Israeli withdrawal from Syria's Golan Heights,
the nature of future Syrian-Israeli relations, the timetable for
implementing a potential Syrian-Israeli agreement, and the border
security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
In its political commentary, Radio Damascus said Tuesday
afternoon that without the resumption of the Syrian-Israeli talks
from where they were left off, there would be no hope for making
any progress.
</P>
<P>
But a chance is still there if Israel respects the
U.N. Security Council resolutions and implements them sincerely.
</P>
<P>
Aiming to give the ill-fated Middle East peace process a push,
Albright started her Mideast in Saudi Arabia on Monday. She will
travel on Tuesday evening to Israel, Palestinian self-rule Areas
and then Egypt after a brief stopover in Syria.

BRUSSELS, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Dutch government said
Tuesday that it is launching a large national amnesty for weapons
other than firearms.

The Netherlands' Justice Ministry and the police are organizing
the amnesty running from December 13 to December 24. During this
period of time, anyone possessing a knife, knuckle-duster, cosh or
other stabbing or striking weapons will be able to hand it in to
the police anonymously and without risk of punishment.

Being backed by a major information campaign, the amnesty is
targeted particularly at the possession of weapons by young people,
the government said in a news release.
</P>

According to the statistics from the Ministry of Justice, there
have been more than 1,300 crimes of violence in the Netherlands

<HEADLINE> U.S. Blocks Electricity Contracts: Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Iraq Tuesday accused U.S. envoys
at the U.N. Sanctions Committee of blocking its some 160 million
U.S. dollars worth of electricity contracts signed with foreign
companies.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed official with the Iraqi General Electricity Company
told the Iraqi News Agency that the U.S. representatives blocked
four contracts signed under the oil-for-food program with the U.N..
</P>
<P>
The contracts put on hold were for buying gas turbine units,
steam turbine units and other electric equipment, said the
official.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the "U.S.-led aggression" in 1991, some
60-90 percent of Iraqi power stations were destroyed, with some
still not being rehabilitated, and as a result electricity supply
in the country is far from enough.
</P>
<P>
As severe winter approaches, Baghdad has been subjected to
electricity failure twice every day and at least two hours each
time, and power supply is even worse in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal, Iraq is allowed to sell limited
amount of oil in every six months to buy food, medicine and
infrastructure-related materials for its people.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has halted oil export on November 22 to protest against
a U.N. resolution to extend the phase six of the deal, which
expired on November 20, for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The members of the U.N. Security Council are discussing a
omnibus resolution on Iraq concerning the resumption of its
weapons inspections and a conditional suspension of the nine-year
crippling sanctions.
</P>
<P>
But Iraq has said that it rejected any resolution that stop
short of lifting the sanctions imposed on Iraq following its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has also repeatedly accused the U.S. and British envoys
at the Sanctions Committee of deliberately hampering the
endorsement of its contracts signed with foreign companies.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Rightist Jews Protest in East Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 7 (Xinhua) -- A group of right-wing Jews
on Tuesday took to the streets in East Jerusalem in protest
against the construction work by Muslim authorities at the Temple
Mount, the most sensitive holy site in the city.
</P>
<P>
As approved by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, the Muslim
Authority in East Jerusalem has began the work to open a sealed
entrance to the underground chamber of the Temple Mount known as
Solomon's Stables which Muslims identify as the 7th Marwani Mosque.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the entrance has triggered sharp dispute between
Muslims and Jews in the city. The right-wing Jews accused the
Muslims of trying to destruct the Temple Mount, on which the Aqsa
Mosque was built.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish protesters marched through the Old City and later
gathered outside the Orient House, the East Jerusalem
Headquarters of the Palestinian Liberation Organization, and
burned Palestinian flags there.
</P>
<P>
Barak held consultations Tuesday afternoon with key cabinet
members, legal advisors and the country's police chief to discuss
the issue.
</P>
<P>
Barak ordered the police to ensure that there are constant
consultations between Muslim authority and Israel's Antiquities
Authority in order to prevent any damage to archaeological
artifacts that are important to all religions, Barak's Office
said.
</P>
<P>
Haim Ramon, Minister of the Prime Minister's Office, also said
Tuesday that the opening of the entrance with two arches has been
approved by Barak. But the Muslim Authority started to open a
third and a fourth arch without permission.
</P>
<P>
The Temple Mount is a source of hot religious tensions and a
spark for potential violence whenever Muslims or Jews suspect the
other of tampering with a fragile status quo.
</P>
<P>
Bloodshed took place three years ago when former Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the opening of an entrance near the
Temple Mount. Six Palestinians and 15 Israelis were killed in the
incident.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and
claims Jerusalem as its united capital. But the Palestinians
reject this claim and want East Jerusalem as capital of a future
Palestinian state.

At present, China has over 100 million religious believers, 85,
000 places for religious activities, 300,000 religious workers,
and 3,000 religious groups.
</P>
<P>
Religious groups have also established 74 religious schools and
universities, the article added.
</P>
<P>
China's religious groups handle their own affairs, manage their
own educational institutes, publish their own religious books and
magazines, and sponsor their own social welfare activities.
</P>
<P>
The rights of religious workers and religious believers are
fully protected by law and no interference in their affairs is
tolerated, it said.
</P>
<P>
It is fair to say that at the present time the implementation
of China's policy of religious freedom is being enforced stronger
than ever before, the article noted.
</P>

As a government document from a world power, the U.S. State
Department report is full of contradictions and logical fallacies.

The U. S. report cites bits of sentences and words from short

to make groundless accusations and present a one-sided picture of

The report reflects not only a bureaucratic work style and
irresponsible attitude on the part of the U.S. administration and
Congress, but also demonstrates hegemonism on the part of a world
power, the article noted.
</P>

This irresponsible report will ultimately harm the existing
good relations between China and the U.S., and eventually endanger
the long-term interests of the U.S. itself, it added.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Scientists Announce Development of DNA AIDS Vaccine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 8 (Xinhua) -- A group of South Korean
scientists announced Wednesday that they have succeeded in
developing a DNA vaccine that has been proven to be effective in
killing the deadly HIV virus.
</P>
<P>
The vaccine was made by Professor Sung Young-chul and his
colleagues at Pohang University of Science and Technology from a
compound of four HIV genes that were approved as safe to humans by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
Key to the development is an HIV gene called the Pol Gene,
which works to activate virus-fighting cells.
</P>
<P>
"The vaccine is engineered to increase the Pol Gene. Once
introduced into the body, the vaccine helps build a factory of
antibodies in the cell," Sung said.
</P>
<P>
In tests with mice, the new vaccine enhanced antibodies to the
virus and activated immune responses that killed HIV-infected
cells.
</P>
<P>
"In the early stages of the experiment, the vaccinated monkeys
showed signs of infection. But the vaccine stimulated the immune
system, keeping the level of the virus under control. They were
all cured between four and 20 weeks," Sung said.
</P>
<P>
Experiments on monkeys, conducted in the German Primate Center,
have also produced similar effects, he said.
</P>
<P>
A modified form of the vaccine will be used in experiments with
humans in the middle of next year.
</P>
<P>
"Though based on experiments with monkeys, this finding will
open new possibilities for both prevention and cure of AIDS in
humans," said Sung.

<HEADLINE> Investigation on Thai Flight Crash Not Concluded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The subcommittee investigating
last year's crash of a Thai Airways International plane said on
Wednesday that the investigation has not concluded yet.
</P>
<P>
Vichai Prateeprecha, chairman of the committee, made the
remarks in response to a report in the Nation newspaper on
Wednesday which quoted an unnamed source as saying the committee
has found that problems involving a rudder and aileron caused the
crash almost a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Airways International also said the airline is unaware
of the report and refused to confirm the report.
</P>
<P>
On December 11, 1998, Thai Airways Flight TG261 from Bangkok
crashed near the airport of the southern province of Surat Thani
airport when trying to land in poor weather condition.Some 101
people were killed in the accident.
</P>
<P>
According to the Nation, the committee found that problems had
occurred with the aileron and rudder while the pilot was in the
middle of a third "go around" after two unsuccessful land attempts.
</P>
<P>
The pilot, who was also killed in the tragedy, failed to solve
the problems, which made the plane crash, the Nation quoted the
source as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Vichai told Xinhua that the investigation by the
committee is still not concluded.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know from where the newspaper got the report and who
gave the information to the newspaper, but it was not from the
committee,"he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the investigation will still "take some time" to reach
a conclusion. He gave no further details about the findings of the
crash by the committee.

<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- "China Youth Daily" reported
today that according to elite Chinese scientists, most cancers
will be curable by 2015 and computers will be more intelligent

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS FMs Put Forward Crisis Prevention Mechanism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOME, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers from 15 West
African countries have recommended a mechanism for the prevention
and management of the sub-regional crisis be set up.
</P>
<P>
The ministers, at a meeting of the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) opened Tuesday in Togo's capital Lome,
suggested that such a mechanism should include a Mediation and
Security Council, a multinational stand-by force, and four Zonal
Observation Bureaux.
</P>
<P>
The proposed Mediation and Security Council is to make
decisions, on behalf of ECOWAS heads of state, on issues important
for the sub-regional peace, according to a report adopted by the
ministers for the 22nd ECOWAS summit, due to open here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The council is to be made up of nine members, with seven of
them being elected out of ECOWAS member states, and two of them
being the current and immediate past chairman states of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also suggested that ECOWAS member states be
obliged to supply, upon request, stand-by armed force units for
peace-keeping operations.
</P>
<P>
They proposed that training centers be set up in Cote d' Ivoire
and Ghana for these units, which will eventually replace the West
African Peacekeeping Force or ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
To provide more effective early-warning and management upon
possible crisis, the ECOWAS ministerial meeting also recommended
the establishment of four Zonal Observation Bureaux in countries
including Benin, Burkina Faso, Gambia and Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the crisis management mechanism, the foreign
ministers also highlighted Sierra Leone peace process, light-arms
control in their adopted report for the summit.
</P>
<P>
The two-day ministerial meeting, also attended by ECOWAS'
finance ministers, is endowed to finalize all agreements to be
approved by heads of state of the 16-member sub-regional
organization.

<HEADLINE> HK Not City Just About Money, Says Anson Chan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Acting Chief Executive of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Anson Chan Wednesday urged
recognition of Hong Kong's role as a cultural hub as well as a
financial hub at the opening ceremony of the Third Conference of
Asian Foundations &AMP; Organizations.
</P>
<P>
"I understand that the choice (of convening the meeting in Hong
Kong) was made in recognition of Hong Kong's role as an
international financial and cultural hub," Chan said.
</P>
<P>
"But I have to say that there are still some people in Hong
Kong who need to recognize that this city is not just about money,
and that the quality of our city depends on a lot more than just
finance," she said.
</P>
<P>
Chan said the role of Hong Kong as a financial hub has long
been recognized, so much that some have said that Hong Kong is
just an economic city.
</P>
<P>
"That has never been entirely true, and with each passing year
as education has spread, as our contacts with other places have
deepened, and as our confidence in our own society has developed,
this city's part in the world's cultural growth and cultural
exchange and experiment has expanded. And I welcome your
recognition of that role," she said.
</P>
<P>
Chan said that deepening understanding throughout Hong Kong's
society that the future of Hong Kong as a financial and cultural
hub depends upon the quality of environment is one of the most
important tasks for this city as it enters the new Millennium.
</P>
<P>
The conference will discuss environment and sustainable
development, the role of civil society in promoting the standard
of living of people in the region and cultural cooperation and
exchange.

<HEADLINE> Bank Indonesia Declares Its Readiness For Millennium Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia said there would
be no glitches in domestic banking transactions in entering the
new millennium, but added it was armed with a contingency plan
just in case, the Jakarta Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's deputy director of information technology
Mulyana Sukarni said the entire transaction system, including on-
line activities, was ready for the Year 2000 (Y2K) bug.
</P>
<P>
"We are sure that there will be no disruptions in clearing
activities when we enter the new year as all the existing
transaction systems are already 100 percent Y2K compliant," he was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mulyana said the central bank devised a contingency plan to
ensure that clearing activities would not be disrupted if the
existing system failed at the turn of the year.
</P>
<P>
He said the central bank would use the semiautomatic off-line
system, known as the "local" clearing system, in the event of a
system failure.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K bug refers to a theory based on older computer systems
recording dates using only the last two digits of the year. If not
corrected, such systems could treat "2000" as "1900", generating
errors or system crashes when the date rolls over to January 1,
2000.
</P>
<P>
Mulyana said the success of the central bank -- as the clearing
agency for all banking transactions in the country -- in beating
the millennium bug would depend heavily on the preparedness of the
commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Of the 167 banks in the country, 162 are 100 percent Y2K
compliant.
</P>
<P>
"Five small banks are still working on their Y2K preparedness
and expected to be fully ready on December 20," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mulyana said Bank Indonesia advised all banks to report to the
central bank prior to the end of the year on the status of their
Y2K prevent management.
</P>
<P>
In the report, each bank should describe the transactions of
its customers, as well as its counterparty banks and the bank's
liquidity position, he added.

Teachers of Special Schools Face Lay-offs in Thailand
</P>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 3,000 teachers and
officials of schools for the disabled and the underprivileged in
Thailand may be laid off due to a budget deficiency, the Bangkok
Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's Deputy Education Minister Kanchana Silpa-archa was
quoted as saying that her ministry was running out of budgets from
the General Education Department and the Miyazawa Fund to pay
nearly 3,000 teachers and staff of schools for the handicapped and
the underprivileged children.
</P>
<P>
If the Thai cabinet rejects the ministry's request for a 117-
million-baht (3 million U.S. dollars) budget to pay these teachers
and school employees for next year, massive lay-offs would be
inevitable, Kanchana said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai cabinet refused to consider Kanchana's budget request
Tuesday at its weekly meeting, referring her proposal to the
Bureaucratic System Reform Committee.
</P>
<P>
The number of disabled children enrolled in special schools in
Thailand this year was 100,500, up from 35,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that 41 schools for the disabled in 35
provinces and 40 schools for underprivileged youngsters in 34
provinces are running out of operating funds.

<HEADLINE> Seminar on Bank Management Held in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- A seminar, sponsored by the
Central Bank of Myanmar and the Deutsche Bank of Germany, was held
here Tuesday to find new methods for bank management in Myanmar in
the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the seminar, Myanmar Minister of
Finance and Revenue U Khin Maung Thein said his country will
reform its banking system as required in accordance with the
changing and developing international banking business, the New
Light of Myanmar reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that special attention should be paid to banking
systems at a time when efforts are being made for economic
recovery in Asia after the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Partly due to the impact of the Asian financial crisis, the
number of local private banks and foreign bank representative
offices in Myanmar dropped.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar reformed its banking system in line with the market-
oriented economic policy adopted since late 1988, allowing the
establishment of private banks as well as foreign bank
representative offices as the first phase of the reforms.
</P>
<P>
The reform process entered the second phase in the last two
years with the signing of memorandums of understanding on setting
up joint venture banks between six Myanmar private banks and six
foreign banks which had already opened offices in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, there are no formal contracts on such joint ventures
reported.

continue foreign-currency transactions for customers during the
December 30 to January 4 period despite concerns about possible
risks associated with the year 2000 computer problem, the Nation
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks noted that transactions would be made as usual
but on the condition that customers were well aware of the risks
and insisted to do so, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Thailand, the country's central bank, issued a
statement last Friday, recommending all commercial banks to
refrain from foreign-currency transactions for which settlement
will fall between December 30 and January 4.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said it would not make any settlements for
banks during that period, meaning that banks would have to use
their own cash for them.
</P>
<P>
The warning has been issued despite the fact that Bank of
Thailand had upgraded its 14 computerized networks and all had
passed the test for Y2K compliance.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation was issued on a voluntary basis, depending
on the commercial banks' judgment.
</P>
<P>
Most commercial banks here have passed the Y2K test and do not
anticipate any problems related to the millennium bug that would
bar banks from dealing with customers.

<HEADLINE> State Enterprises Reform Being Speeded up in Central China City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Wuhan, capital of central China's
Hubei Province, has resorted to a range of measures to accelerate
the pace of reform in state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
According to a decision made at a recent enlarged meeting of
Wuhan City Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), Wuhan
would focus state capital on high-tech industry, pillar industries
like iron and steel and automobiles, urban infrastructure and
commonweal industry since early this year.
</P>
<P>
The decision noted that the city will not launch new wholly
state-invested businesses but diversify the ownerships of the
existing soly state-financed businesses in five to ten years.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, state funds would be withdrawn in an orderly
way from those competitive industries like ordinary processing
industry and retail services by such means as auctioning state
assets and setting up new joint ventures. And more state capital
would be pooled into the industries that will help further
increase the city's comprehensive competitiveness and improve
investment environment.
</P>
<P>
Private businesspeople and investors from overseas will be
encouraged to fill in the void left by the state capital in medium-
sized and small state-owned enterprises in varying forms.
</P>
<P>
The city also plans to form, through assets reorganization, a
number of conglomerates with annual sales exceeding 10 billion
yuan (1.2 billion US dollars) each in the sectors like iron and
steel, automobile, tobacco, petrochemical industry,
telecommunications, real estate and commerce by in ten years' time.
</P>
<P>
Besides, more failing state enterprises will be let to go
bankrupt or to be taken over. The state-owned enterprises, which
are located in the downtown areas but are outmoded and seriously
pollutant, will have to be relocated into industrial parks built
on the outskirts.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: The UN at the Turn of the Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 8 (Xinhua) -- When the U.S.-led NATO by-
passed the UN Security Council and waged a 78-day massive military
intervention into the internal affairs of the sovereign state of
Yugoslavia, many questioned about the fate of the 54-year-old
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Can it continue to be an effective mediator of peace and
promoter of development in the new century?
</P>
<P>
Though new types of hegemonism and power politics have
challenged the wisdom of the world body in many ways in the post
Cold War era and further challenges are expected in the years
ahead, undoubtedly, the changing world still needs a strong United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
The year 1999 saw the NATO setting a dangerous precedent in
ignoring the authority of the UN Security Council. The war caused
tremendous humanitarian disaster in a world which faces growing
humanitarian burden due to numerous regional conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The year also saw the western countries more rampantly
preaching the theory of "human rights over sovereignty", diluting
the essence of the UN Charter calling for sovereign equality of
member states.
</P>
<P>
The rise of neo-isolationism in the U.S. Congress led to the
Senate's rejection in October of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test
Ban Treaty (CTBT), with negative impact on the international
disarmament movement and the nuclear test ban process.
</P>
<P>
The CTBT was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1996 with
the number of signatories growing to over 150.
</P>
<P>
Another feature of the U.S. neo-isolationism is the chronicled
denial of its UN dues, making it more difficult for the
organization to cope with its mounting peacekeeping missions,
development assistance and day-to-day operations.
</P>
<P>
However, none of the UN members doubts the UN merits in trying
to resolve the issues of international security. Even those in the
U.S. administration recognize the "indispensable" role of the
United Nations in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The international cooperation in bringing an end to the East
Timor conflict and in making unremitting efforts to crackdown
terrorism, drug trafficking and other crimes has given due
credibility to the UN, whose membership has increased to 188 from
51 at its birth in 1945.
</P>
<P>
The toughest issues such as the Kosovo conflict and the
nuclear issue in Iraq have eventually had to return to the table
of the UN Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The developing countries are pinning their hope on a greater
UN role in helping establish a just and reasonable international
political and economic order.
</P>
<P>
The opinions expressed by the developing countries at the
current session of the UN General Assembly and those to be
expressed at the regional hearings for a UN Millennium Assembly
next year indicate that they do not want the superpower to impose
its political intentions on the UN.
</P>
<P>
They call on the UN to be responsible for the peoples of the
world instead of a small number of states and ask its member
states which neglect the international commitments to honor their
pledges in line with the UN Charter.
</P>
<P>
As the gap between the rich and poor has been widening, the UN
is urged to attach equal importance to both the peacekeeping
missions and development assistance by paying more attention to
the latter for the benefit of poverty eradication and
consolidation of independence, when the weak countries bear more
negative effects of globalization.
</P>
<P>
Destined not to be a universal government, the UN has to act
within its mandates. However, its existence has proven its value
for peace and development. There has been no world war since 1945
while the global wealth has expanded many folds, surpassing the
pace of the population growth.
</P>
<P>
It is conceivable that the UN Charter will continue to glitter
beyond the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Portugese Joint Declaration Signatory Confident of Macao's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Former Portuguese Prime Minister
Anibal Cavaco Silva said Tuesday that he is confident of Macao's
future and that Macao will continue to serve as a strong link
between the Chinese and Portuguese people after its return to
China.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Chinese reporters, Silva, who signed the
Sino-Portugese Joint Declaration on the Question of Macao in 1987,
said the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping's concept of "one
country, two systems" plays a decisive role in the settlement of
the Macao issue.
</P>
<P>
He said the concept ensures the continuity of Macao's current
political and economic systems for at least 50 years, which is of
crucial importance to the creation of an atmosphere of trust, the
insurance of social stability and economic development in the
territory.
</P>
<P>
Believing that the solution to the historical problem according
to the joint declaration conforms to the interests of China,
Portugal and Macao itself, he added, it is thereby welcomed by the
local residents in Macao and has won broad recognition from all
parties in Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Silva was Portuguese prime minister from 1985 to 1995, during
which he twice visited China. He said he not only signed the
historical document of joint declaration but also witnessed
Macao's smooth transition in his capacity as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on the negotiation on the Macao's issue, Silva said
that it was no easy job to secure a successful solution to the 450-
year-old issue. Although some problems, even difficulties,
surfaced in the process, the Chinese and Portuguese negotiators
were mutually respectful and worked to maintain friendly
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The successful settlement of the Macao issue, he said, has set
a good example for the international community.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Macao's future, Silva said the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) will be born in a few days. "I welcome
it and pin great hope on it."
</P>
<P>
Macao is not only a window of China's opening to the outside
world but also an ideal gateway through which Portugal and other
European countries can get to China and other Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
He said he is sure the industrial and cultural circles in Macao
have stronger confidence in Macao than 15 or 20 years ago, and
believed, after Macao's return to China, the Sino-Portugese ties
will forge ahead as always.
</P>
<P>
The former prime minister, who is now holding several posts and
has an office in the central bank, said he will attend the grand
ceremony on Macao and sincerely wishes the Macao SAR a great
success.

<HEADLINE> Oil Exploration in Bohai Exceeds 300 mln Tons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, December 8 (Xinhua) -- China discovered two oil and
gas fields in the Bohai Bay this year with reserves surpassing 300
million tons.
</P>
<P>
The discovered reserves in the area this year have been the
highest in history, according to officials at the Bohai Oilfield
in northern China.
</P>
<P>
This year, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation urged
various subsidiaries to intensify exploration with their own
efforts. At the same time, they are required to strengthen co-
operation with foreign partners.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year, the United States' Phillips oil
company discovered offshore oil reserves estimated at about 300
million tons in the southern part of the Bohai Bay. This is the
first pool with more than 100 million tons found in Bohai in two
decades.
</P>
<P>
Depending on itself, China discovered a pool in the central
part of the Bohai Bay, which has pumped high-yield industrial oil
and gas stream. Geologists predicted the pool has a promising
prospect for development.
</P>
<P>
Experts said China has intensified research into the geological
structure of the Bohai Bay with greater investment this year. At
the same time, Chinese geologists claimed that they have made a
breakthrough in the study of oil formation in shallow geological
structures and have made bold steps in exploration.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Soeharto Named Suspect in Graft Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian former president
Soeharto would be questioned as a suspect in alleged corruption
during his 32 years in power, Attorney General Marzuki Darusman
said, national newspapers reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are reopening the investigation and by definition and as a
consequence, Mr. Soeharto is clearly a suspect in the case,"
Marzuki said, adding that the former president would be charged
with abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Marzuki said his office would reopen the corruption
investigation into Soeharto based on fresh evidence which
indicated that he misused his power to collect money to finance
his seven charitable foundations as well as for the benefit of his
family and cronies.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, who was forced down in May last year, suffered a
stroke in July and intestinal bleeding the following month. His
lawyers had said Soeharto was in poor health and unable to speak,
but he appeared in good health last month when he visited the tomb
of his late wife Tien in her former Central Java hometown of
Surakarta.
</P>
<P>
"He can now be questioned. He is not sick anymore," Marzuki was
quoted by the newspapers as saying.
</P>
<P>
Marzuki did not say when Soeharto will be summoned for
questioning.
</P>
<P>
He said a team to investigate Soeharto has been set up and
would be announced soon.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether Soeharto's children would also be questioned
in the renewed investigation, Marzuki said: "We are not ruling out
possibilities, if the investigation leads to that, then that would
be a consequence of the investigation."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 8 (Xinhua) -- China's efforts to boost
exports by raising its tax rebate quota has taken effect since the
end of the Asian financial crisis, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The English newspaper quoted a senior official with the State
Administration of Taxation as saying that China has raised the
quota by 6.6 billion yuan over the first proposed 57 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The government relied on tax rebates to jump-start commodities
that slowed down during the regional financial meltdown.
</P>
<P>
In June, the tax administration raised the quota by 3
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Signs have shown that exports are back on normal track. The
value of exports rose 4.3 percent to reach 155 billion U.S.
dollars in the first ten months this year, a hefty increase from
the 4.6-percent decline in the first six months, the official said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of October, nearly 42 billion yuan in taxes had been
refunded to exporters, he added.

</P>
<P>
According to the decision, beginning from January 1 next year,
the province will limit and eventually eliminate the use of freon
that has destructive impact on atmospheric environment.
</P>
<P>
The decision says that all repair centers, shops and factories
should use non-freon materials when repairing or replacing
refrigeration agents used in home refrigerators, freezers, air
conditioners, air conditioning system in automobiles, as well as
industrial and commercial refrigeration equipment.
</P>
<P>
Freon as refrigeration agents in all air conditioning systems
in automobiles, industrial and commercial refrigeration equipment
and air conditioners now in service should gradually be replaced
with new refrigeration agents that are up to the international
standards.
</P>
<P>
Any new projects that will involve production and use of freon
will be banned. All corporate institutions and private
businessmen engaged in retail sales will not be allowed to place
orders for or store refrigeration agents containing freon or home
refrigerators, freezers, industrial and commercial refrigeration
equipment that will require use of freon as refrigeration agents.
</P>
<P>
All newly-built or expanded hotels, new industrial and
commercial projects should use freon-free refrigeration equipment,
said the decision.
</P>
<P>
Violators of the decision will be punished according to
relevant state and provincial laws and regulations, the decision
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Govt to Continue Social Safety Net Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government would
continue the social safety net program to help at least 38 million
people living below the poverty line throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for People's Welfare and Poverty
Eradication Basri Hasanuddin said the World Bank had expressed
interest in resuming its loan disbursement, but at the same time
asked the government to revise the current program with a more
sustainable one.
</P>
<P>
"I just discussed (the issue) with the World Bank Monday and
they want the social safety net program to be implemented as part
of a more durable poverty elimination program," Basri was quoted
by national newspapers Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
suspended disbursement of their loans following the Bank Bali
scandal and alleged fund abuse for money politics.
</P>
<P>
The scandal involves the dubious transfer in early June of a
commission of some 546 billion rupiah (78 million U.S. dollars)
from Bank Bali to a private firm linked to close associates of
former president B.J. Habibie and the Golkar Party. The commission
was paid ostensibly for a private company's assistance in
recouping loans from closed banks.
</P>
<P>
The postponement will affect the 600 million U.S. dollars in
World Bank soft loans to support the social safety net adjustments
which had been set in the budget at 6 trillion rupiah (about 860
million U.S.dollars) for the current fiscal year ending March 2000.
</P>
<P>
Basri said the majority of the Social Safety Net fund is
allocated for education assistance, including scholarships for
students from elementary schools to higher education.
</P>
<P>
Three other sectors to get the fund are food, health and job
creation.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government and the IMF are currently negotiating
the conditions of the aid disbursement in the next letter of
intent, which is expected to be signed next month.
</P>
<P>
Basri said the poverty eradication program which was
implemented by the government is closely linked to the economic
recovery program and if the economy recovers soon, the number of
poor people is expected to drop.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Provides Military Aid to Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, December 7 (Xinhua)-- U.S. Ambassador Joseph Limprecht
on Tuesday handed over an aid of 1 million U.S. dollars to Albania
to boost the military effectiveness of the Intercommunication
Brigade, media reports said.
</P>
<P>
The aid is part of Warsaw Package Initiative reached in 1994
when U.S. President Bill Clinton promised to provide military aid
to Partnership for Peace program members.
</P>
<P>
Limprecht said that the United States is preparing another aid
worth 2.3 million dollars for the Albanian army.
</P>
<P>
"The considerable assistance the U.S. is providing for the
Albanian army will increase its communicating capacities according
to Western modern parameters," Albanian Defense Minister Luan
Hajdaraga said at the hand-over ceremony.
</P>
<P>
This aid will raise the effectiveness of Intercommunication
Brigade in "Herald Hermes 99" training, started on Monday with
Bulgaria, Georgia, Greece and Romania in the framework of the
Partnership for Peace program.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian armed forces have also utilized a grant worth 260,
641 dollars provided by the U.S. in 1996 to buy tactical radios.
Up to now, the United States has given Albania four million
dollars of military aid.

<HEADLINE> Mercosur Postpones Common Motor Vehicle Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The Southern Common Market (
Mercosur) decided Tuesday to postpone the definition of a common
motor vehicle policy.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a meeting held simultaneously with the
17th Meeting of the Common Market Council of the bloc that is
evaluating the integration process in crisis.
</P>
<P>
Industry ministers of four Mercosur members -- Argentina,
Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay agreed on new talks between
Argentina and Brazil in Buenos Aires next week, said Argentine
Industry Minister Alietto Guadagni who believed that before the
end of this year there would be an agreement on motor vehicles
within Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
Argentina and Brazil have proposed a Common Automotive Policy (
PAC) that would raise the external common custom tariff of the
bloc for the import of motor vehicles from outside the zone, from
the present 23 percent to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
The PAC, expected to go in force on January 1, 2000,
establishes a coordination between the national policies of the
four countries and fixes requisites for a vehicle to be considered
national or of Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
Brazil wants all internal trade barriers removed as soon as
possible, but Argentina insists on a phasing-in period until 2004,
when trade in Mercosur's automobile sector will be free of all
restrictions, with a common external tariff of 35 percent for
vehicle imports.
</P>
<P>
Argentina's automotive industry would suffer the most if no
accord is reached by the end of this year. Brazil's devaluation of
the real has made Argentine cars more expensive. Argentina exports
about half of its vehicle output to its northern neighbors and
more than 90 percent of that goes to Brazil.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian swimmer Richard Sam
Bera expressed hope that the national men's 4 x 100m relay team
would be able to reach its ambitious goal to be the best in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Our best time in the 1999 Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in
Brunei Darussalam in August was three minutes and 27.69 seconds,"
Bera was quoted by the Jakarta Post Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The current number one team, Japan, is only one second faster
than us. If we can be Asia's number one, I think we can be the
world's number six," he said.
</P>
<P>
The men's team comprises of Bera, Wisnu Wardhana and the twins
Albert and Felix Christiadi Sutanto.
</P>
<P>
Bera said the team aimed to finished third in the Asian
Championships in Pusan, South Korea, in March and also qualify for
the 2000 Olympic Games in the A time limit of 3:25.00.
</P>
<P>
The team will compete in one of the Grand Prix series in Hong
Kong, China, on January 8 and 9.
</P>
<P>
"When we return home from Hong Kong, we will focus our
attention on sprint events, especially the twins, as they are
still swimming in the 400 meters," said 27-year-old Bera.
</P>
<P>
He said his main problem was finding the time to practice as he
works as a business consultant for the National Development and
Planning Board.
</P>
<P>
Teammate Wisnu said he wanted to continue his training in the
United States as he hadn't finished his final term studies.
</P>
<P>
Albert shared the same ideas about training in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
"It's more fun and we feel more competitive. Here, there are
only four or five of us training in the Senayan swimming pool. It'
s not cheerful," he added.

STOCKHOLM, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Sweden applauded the
decisions made by the world soccer's governing body FIFA to
increase the number of the women's soccer teams competing at the
2004 Olympic Games and to move up the Women's World Cup one year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Marikadomanski Lyfors, head coach of the Swedish women's squad,
said here on Tuesday that with the increasingly popularity of the
women's soccer all around the world, it is a good move for FIFA to
increase the number of the competing teams to 12 from 8.
</P>
<P>
FIFA has also planned to stage the Women's World Cup in 2002
instead of 2003 for a better interval between the major soccer
events.
</P>
<P>
Lyfors admitted that the schedule change might bring it more
difficult for her players to take the world crown, but she still
believed FIFA's decisions were "absolutely right".
</P>
<P>
"An earlier world cup won't be a hurdle on our way to victory,"
Lyfors said.

The coach earlier revealed that they had a two-step long-term
target, which is to enter the top three at the 2000 Sydney Olympic
Games and to the title at the World Cup.

<HEADLINE> Heroin Death Increases in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- A total of 737 people in
Australia died from heroin overdoses in 1998, a 23 percent
increase over 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the National Drug and Alcohol
Research Center, heroin overdoses now account for almost one in 10
deaths among Australians aged 15-44, with young men accounting for
more than 80 percent of all overdose fatalities.
</P>
<P>
New South Wales state had the highest number of heroin deaths
with 358 and Victoria recorded 210.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is a national disaster and it is part of an
incredible upward trend that started three years ago. This year is
going to be even worse," Tony Trimingham was quoted Tuesday by AAP.
</P>
<P>
Tony set up his family-help group Family Drug Support several
years ago after his son died of a heroin overdose.
</P>
<P>
The state governments of both New South Wales and Victoria are
reportedly preparing to set up supervised heroin injecting centers
to reduce heroin death.
</P>
<P>
Paul Dillon, information manager of the National Drug and
Alcohol Research Center supported the policy of the two states,
saying: "We need to look at as many different strategies as
possible, such as heroin trials and safe injecting rooms."

<HEADLINE> Mexico, U.S. Sign Energy Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Mexico and the United
States Tuesday signed an agreement on environment protection in
oil and natural gas exploitation.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Mexican Energy Secretary Luis
Tellez and his U.S. counterpart Bill Richardson during a meeting
in Mexico's famous tourism city of Cancun, 1,233 kilometers east
of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said the amendment to the Bilateral Agreement on
Energy Cooperation will expand the exchange of information between
the two countries for the protection of environment during the
extraction and exploration of oil and gas.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said the amendment will contribute to the reduction
of contaminant emissions in the energy industries, according to
the Kyoto Protocol.
</P>
<P>
Kyoto Protocol was passed in a UN climate change conference in
December 1997 in Kyoto of Japan, obliging the developed countries
to cut more of their greenhouse gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
The amendment will affect the use of solar and wind energy, and
in the border electricity industry, among other things, said
Richardson.
</P>
<P>
Tellez said the United States is willing to transfer technology
for the clean production of fossil and non-fossil fuels.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the two countries attended the 4th International
Conference on Natural Gas held in Cancun from Monday to Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The forum was organized by the Mexican Energy Secretariat, the
International Energy Agency and the Mexican Natural Gas
Association.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Several months after
quitting professional tennis, Steffi Graf overcame her inactivity
to beat South Africa's top-ranked woman Amanda Coetzer in the
first of three exhibition matches in Burban, South Africa, on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Graf was leading Coetzer 6-3, 4-3 at the Westridge Stadium when
rain interrupted the match. She went on to win the final set 7-6,
taking the tiebreaker 7-3.
</P>
<P>
The match was the first stop of a farewell world exhibition
tour for the German, who retired from the professional tennis
circuit in August, saying she had nothing left to achieve and was
not having fun any more.
</P>
<P>
Graf, 30, won 22 Grand Slam titles, the 1988 Olympic title and
another 107 tournaments during her career, which began at age 13.
</P>
<P>
The encounter was the 15th time between Graf and the 28-year-
old Coetzer, with German having won 12 times.
</P>
<P>
The two are scheduled to play again in Stellenbosch near Cape
Town on Friday and in Johannesburg on Sunday.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, December 7 (Xinhua) -- A Mexican navy ship
captured a fishing boat with eight tons of cocaine in the Pacific
Ocean off the southwestern Michoacan state coast, the authorities
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The drug was found last Friday during an inspection of the
Mexican fishing boat "Alfonso Martinez Dominguez II," 163 miles
southwest of the Lazaro Cardenas port, according to the Federal
Attorney of the Republic Office (PGR) spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The seizure of the drug was made thanks to information provided
by the U.S. Coast Guard Service, said the legal sources.
</P>
<P>
The boat with the drug had set out November 15 from the port of
Salina Cruz, in the state of Oaxaca, southeast of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The PGR told the press that 26 tons of cocaine had been seized
in the first 11 months of the year.
</P>
<P>
The Navy captured 10 tons of cocaine on August 14 in a fishing
boat in Pacific Ocean waters off the state of Colima, and on June
16 it seized six tons in a fishing boat off the state of Chiapas.

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief Meets Clinton over Chechnya, Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- New Secretary-General George
Robertson of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) said
Tuesday that Russia's current policy on Chechnya is wrong, but the
west will not cut assistance to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Robertson made the statement after meeting U.S. President Bill
Clinton at the White House over Kosovo and Chechnya issues.
</P>
<P>
"We said that what is happening there is unacceptable,
disproportionate and we hope that they will change their tactics
and bear in mind very much the humanitarian concerns being
expressed across the globe, as well as the implications for
surrounding states," Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
Russia is trying to rootout the rebels and bandits in its
republic of Chechnya. However, the western countries interfere in
the domestic affairs of Russia, calling on Moscow to stop the
operation.
</P>
<P>
But Robertson also admitted that NATO also sympathizes the
serious problems Russia is facing in the republic, but stressing
the operation there is "unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
"NATO is made up of 19 democracies and 19 countries, 19 leaders,
and they've all been expressing the view that what the Russians
are doing at the moment is not in the interests of the Russian
objectives," he added.
</P>
<P>
"They have serious problems in Chechnya --of lawlessness, of
banditry, of a collapse of law and order -- and they are reacting
in a way that we don't think makes much sense in dealing with a
problem that we believe is a serious one, and one with which we
sympathize," he added.
</P>
<P>
NATO conducted a 78-day bombing against Yugoslavia in excuse of
humanitarian crisis in Kosovo. This was condemned by many
countries in the world, particularly Russia.
</P>
<P>
Robertson told reporters that the west has no plan to cut
assistance to Russia despite the situation in Chechnya.

<HEADLINE> Chelsea Survives Euro Grilling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- English premier league football
club Chelsea survived a fierce test of their European credentials,
grinding out a valuable goalless draw against Lazio in Rome,
despite having their manager sent off on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Gianluica Vialli's men played a near-perfect continental
encounter, soaking up Italian pressure while displaying their own
counter-attacking threat at the Champions League second phase
Group D match.
</P>
<P>
Vialli was forced to watch a third of the match from a
television monitor in the tunnel after being red-carded for
swearing but his players rallied in his absence.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea and Lazio have four points in group D with Feyenoord on
three, earned from a 3-0 win over pointless Marseille which saw
three players sent off.
</P>
<P>
Lazio, now unbeaten in Europe for 17 matches, rarely troubled
Chelsea's French defensive duo of Marcel Desailly and Frank
Leboeuf, who dealt masterfully with Vialli's old Sampdoria team
mate Roberto Mancini.
</P>
<P>
Attilio Lombardo came closest to breaking through for the home
side when he flicked a Sebastian Veron corner on to the near post
in the 66th minute while Celestine Babayaro went closest for the
Londoners.
</P>
<P>
Real Madrid, suffering their worst league start for 25 years,
had a brilliant performance before home crowds this evening. The
Spaniards scored two late goals to beat troublesome Rosenborg
Trondheim 3-1 in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
Madrid lead group C on a maximum six points, two ahead of
Bayern Munich who beat Dynamo Kiev 2-1.
</P>
<P>
Madrid went into Tuesday's match on the back of a 5-1 home
Spanish league defeat by Real Zaragoza and were facing another
poor result with five minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
Raul Gonzalez had put Real ahead in the 17th minute but an
unmarked John Carew headed an equaliser two minutes into the
second half for the Norwegians, who continue to be a thorn in the
side of the Continent's big name teams.
</P>
<P>
However, managerless Madrid's Brazilian duo came to the rescue
as Savio blasted in a shot in the 85th minute and Roberto Carlos
made it safe in injury time.
</P>
<P>
Bayern Munich, beaten finalists last season, are suffering no
domestic problems as they lead the Bundesliga but they also needed
a late goal by a Brazilian to take three points.
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Paulo Sergio was the man of the moment. Set up by
Carsten Jancker, he hit the winner from close range with 10
minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
Jancker had put Bayern in front in the sixth minute thanks to a
blunder from Kiev goalkeeper Olexander Shovkovsky, who dropped the
ball in front of him from a harmless Lothar Matthaeus corner.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainians levelled five minutes into the second half as a
pass by Alexei Gerassimenko sprung the offside trap to set up
Serhiy Rebrov, who finished easily, but they are yet to manage a
point from their two second phase games.
</P>
<P>
Feyenoord, beaten 3-1 at home by Chelsea two weeks ago,
recovered from having captain Kees van Wonderen sent off in the
seventh minute to overcome Marseille with three late goals.
</P>
<P>
Argentine Julio Cruz, who scored twice in a 3-1 weekend victory
over Sparta Rotterdam, got another two on Tuesday in the 72nd and
90th minutes.
</P>
<P>
Paul Bosvelt was on target in between with a diving header as
the Dutch side cashed in Marseille's double sending-off.
</P>
<P>
Van Wonderen had gone for a professional foul on Florian
Maurice while Marseille defender Yannick Fischer in the 62nd and
fullback Sebastien Perez in the 72nd both walked after second
bookings.

NEW YORK, December 7 (Xinhua) -- A large multifunctional savage
ship arrived at Quonset Point, Rhode Island of the United States
Tuesday for deep-water search and recovery of wreckage and human
remains on the crash site of a Boeing 767 belonging to EgyptAir
900, U.S. sources said.
</P>
<P>
The 522-foot ship called Smit Pioneer with a displacement of
14,976 tones was contracted by the Navy and is expected to begin
operations around Thursday after being docked for two days and
sailing to the site in the Atlantic some 100 kilometers off U.S.
southeast coast, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (
NTSB) said.
</P>
<P>
Recovery efforts will take place at depths of 240 to 270 feet
in an area of less than 1 square mile, it said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-bound jet crashed on October 31, killing all 217
aboard soon after departing New York. U.S. and Egyptian
investigators have been digging into the course leading to the
tragedy.

Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500

<P>
The Dow index fell again as investors continued to correct

Drop in the Coca-Cola stock price also helped to drag the Dow
lower for a second consecutive session. Wall Street analysts
downgraded their ratings on Coke stock today after the company
announced Monday that its chairman and chief executive Douglas
Investor will step down in April, next year.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq index was pushed higher as investors pursued
technology stocks after the Labor Department reported that
American workers' productivity grew in the third quarter of 1999
at the fastest rate in seven years, while labor costs declined.
The high productivity was benefited from the rapid development in
high technology.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Defense Department Studies Alternatives to F-22 Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Defense Department
told a House panel Tuesday that it is studying alternatives to the
Air Force's F-22 stealth fighter after Congress delayed production
plans and scaled back finances for the 62-billion-U.S.-dollar
program.
</P>
<P>
The study was ordered last summer after the surprise House
Appropriations Committee vote to cut all 1.8 billion U.S. dollars
the Air Force wanted to build the first six planes, said George
Schneiter, director of strategic and tactical systems of the
Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
"We have great hope the F-22 program will be carried out within
the cost estimates. But one has to look at eventualities if that
should not come about," Schneiter said.
</P>
<P>
A House-Senate conference committee eventually restored all but
500 million U.S. dollars of the money cut by the House. But
production was prohibited until certain performance tests are met,
and 300 million U.S. dollars was set aside for "termination
liability" to Lockheed Martin, the prime contractor, should
Congress decide next year not to proceed.
</P>
<P>
The study of F-22 alternatives, Schneiter said, will be
reviewed next week by the Pentagon's top acquisition official. But
he said preliminary results suggest that the F-22's unique
capabilities cannot be replaced if the program is canceled.
</P>
<P>
The House appropriations panel that initially cut off the F-22'
s funds suggested using the money instead to build more F-15 and F-
16 fighters, the planes the Air Force wants to replace with the F-
22.
</P>
<P>
Schneiter said improvements to the F-15 and other aircraft are
among alternatives under consideration.

would be regarding the duration of the talks, the spokesman said "
We have as much time as the parties might want to give to this
process. As long as they feel they are making progress and it's
worth continuing the discussions, We are happy to continue to
facilitate them."
</P>
<P>
The "proximity talks" between the two parties began last Friday.
It means that the two parties are within each other but they do
not meet face to face. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and his
Special Advisor De Soto shuttle between them.
