<HEADLINE> French Proposal on Ceasefire Based on July Understanding: Lebanese FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A French proposal on a ceasefire
between Israel and Lebanon, which will be brought to the region by
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette, is based on a "July
understanding."
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz made the remark today at
a press conference held in his office. Boueiz denied that the
French proposal contains a landing of a French force in Lebanon to
guarantee the ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Under the July understanding, a U.S.-mediated tacit agreement
which put an end to an Israeli blitz in south Lebanon in July
1993, Israel was asked to refrain from attacking civilian targets
in south Lebanon in exchange for a Hezbollah's promise to stop
firing Katyusha rockets at Jewish settlements in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz disclosed that the French proposal was formed following
contacts between de Charette and himself and a meeting between
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Al-Hariri and French President
Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting with Hariri in Paris Sunday night, French
President Chirac asked de Charette to "immediately go to the
Middle East" to mediate a ceasefire, according to a presidential
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Hariri said that Israel is a basic part in the July
understanding, but "it was Israel which has broken the
understanding."
</P>
<P>
He criticized the Israeli logic that the July understanding,
which talks about Hezbollah's stop of firing Katyusha rockets in
return for Israel's refraining from attacking Lebanese civilians,
limited the military operations to those between the resistance
and the Israeli army inside the Lebanese occupied lands.
</P>
<P>
"What Israel wants now is a stop of firing Katyusha rockets in
all cases," he said, "this means that Israel can launch
aggressions as it likes and carry out punitive operations in all
cases."
</P>
<P>
This means "Lebanon has no right at all to respond to (the
Israeli agressions), or the responses should be limited to those
inside the Lebanese regions, even if Israel is doing the most
disgusting things against the Lebanese people."
</P>
<P>
"This logic is unacceptable," the Lebanese foreign minister
added, stressing Lebanon's commitment to a reference to the July
understanding.
</P>
<P>
"The reference meets the need for all parties," he said, "and
it restricts a framework of the violence and (military)
operations, and prevents them from going beyond a certain limit to
threaten actually the Middle East peace process."

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Falling Rand Benefits Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A continuing fall in the
value of South Africa's local currency Rand, coupled with high
world maize prices and an expected local surplus, may benefit
the farmers.
</P>
<P>
Jan Grobler, Chairman of the National Maize Producers'
Organization, said here today that farmers are now more confident
than they were.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a local maize surplus of about two million tons
could be exported at favourable rates, which would earn valuable
foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Rand, which had been weak for a long time,
hit its recorded low of 4.19 against the Dollar in the financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is expecting a good harvest this year due to the
fact that there has been enough rainfall during the planting season
early this year throughout main agricultural areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
However, Grobler warned farmers and cooperatives against
selling their maize locally at current prices, which he described
as laughably low.
</P>
<P>
Maize Board Chief Economist Pieter Esterhuizen also said South
Africa might export maize valued at 1.2 billion Rand (about 316
million U. Dollars) in the marketing year beginning May 1.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela
will discuss with Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu
Buthelezi on the possible delay or staggering of the local polls
in the strife-torn Kwazulu/Natal Province.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana said Mandela is not
concerned about Buthelezi's weekend statements that the IFP would
quit the government of national unity should the elections not
proceed as scheduled on May 29.
</P>
<P>
"These kind of remarks have been made in the past, and there's
no reason to believe that they carry a different impact now than
they did before," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Mankahlana also confirmed that Mandela had met Pan Africanist
Congress leader Clarence Makwetu this morning about the poll's
fate as part of his continuing consultations with other political
party leaders.
</P>
<P>
He said although Mandela had not met National Party (NP)
leader F. W. de Klerk at the weekend, he had discussed the matter
with NP Secretary-General Roelf Meyer and NP Kwazulu/Natal leader
Danie Schutte.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is considering a possible postponement of the May 29
local elections following last week's reports from the African
National Congress in Kwazulu/Natal that violence and voter
registration irregularities were not conducive to free and fair
polls.
</P>
<P>
However, the president emphasized that a final decision on the
poll would be taken after the full consultations with all
interested parties in Kwazulu/Natal.

ADDIS ABABA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- "Many African countries
suffer from high and persistent unemployment and there is a
growing concern over problems of low pay and the reduced
employment prospects of unskilled workers due to the stagnation
of African economy."
</P>
<P>
This was said by Ethiopian Minister of Labor and Social

session of the Labor Commission of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) at Africa Hall here.
</P>

Abdella mentioned problem of severe and grave indebtedness,
mismatch between the prices of imported and exported goods,
absence of the necessary skilled manpower, lack of peace and
stability and the problem of marginalization as some of the major
factors that caused africa's underdevelopment.
</P>

economy over the past two decades. Its share of world trade and
investment has declined to negligible proportions and isolated in

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 15 (Xinhua) -- NATO Commander for Europe U.S.
General George Joulwan said today NATO will do everything to
maintain peace in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
While visiting Implementation Force (IFOR) based in Serb city
Banja Luka in northwestern Bosnia, he said that after the
successful deployment of the 60,000-strong IFOR troops, there were
enough forces in both entities in Bosnia to keep peace process on
track.
</P>
<P>
IFOR troops started flooding into Bosnia in mid-December of
last year to enforce the Bosnia peace agreement reached in Dayton,
the United States, a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
Joulwan expressed hope that complete freedom of movement would
be established throughout Bosnia soon and that Banja Luka, the
largest city in Serb entity, would cooperate to that effect. The
freedom of movement is still not fully realized in Bosnia which is
divided by two entities -- Serb state Republika Srpska and
Muslim-Croat federation.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether NATO troops would withdraw by the end of this
year after one-year mission, the U.S. general said that it was
still too early to speak about that. Under the Dayton accords, the
IFOR troops only stay in Bosnia for one year.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to see what will be done for peace in the next
eight months. At this moment, it is most important to realize the
civilian aspect of the agreement, that is the return of refugees,
preparation for elections and the raising of funds for
reconstruction, which I hope will be accomplished by the end of
the year," Tanjug news agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Joulwan also said he was pleased with the situation in IFOR's
Sector Southwest in Banja Luka area and was grateful for the
cooperation of local administration with the IFOR troops.

</P>
<P>
According to the report, Krahn fighters loyal to Johnson still
hold about 600 hostages in their stronghold of the Barclay
Barracks, including 22 soldiers of the West African Peacekeepers
(ECOMOG) and 50 Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
A report quoted Charles Taylor, a vice chairman of the
six-man transitional Council of State, as saying that the
interim government would not negotiate with Johnson for the
release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
"As a government we are not going to negotiate with these
terrorists," Taylor said, adding that Johnson should surrender to
the government.
</P>
<P>
Currently troops of the Nigerian-led ECOMOG regional
peacekeeping force are being deployed around the Barclay
Training Center Barracks.

<HEADLINE> High Pay Takes too Much out of UK Companies' Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- British companies' profits are low
in international terms because labour is being paid more than can
be justified in terms of productivity, says a report released
today by an economic consultancy.
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared by the Centre for Economic and Business
Research (CEBR), says that low profitability has held back
companies' investment, allowing less scope for growth.
</P>
<P>
Douglas McWilliams, chief executive of the CEBR, says,"we pay
ourselves 1.5 times more than we can afford if we are to be
internationally competitive."
</P>
<P>
Over the next 25 years, pay needs to fall from a current 68
percent of companies' added value to about 40 to 45 percent to
bring British companies up to comparable levels of profit and
investment.
</P>
<P>
Pay and labour costs will need to rise by an average of 1.35
percent less than the growth in productivity over the period.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Premier to Visit Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Karim Kabariti is to pay a short visit to Israel Tuesday as part
of Jordan's intensive diplomatic efforts led by King Hussein on
the latest development in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During his brief visit, his first to Israel since he was
appointed as the prime minister last February, Kabariti will
deliver a message from King Hussein to Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres on the situation in Lebanon and the necessity to
stop the bloodshed there.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jordan's Lower House of Parliament denounced here
today Israel's aggression on Lebanon and its military attacks on
civilians.
</P>
<P>
The Lower House also appealed for emergency aid to the
Lebanese people.
</P>
<P>
A statement released here today by the Lower House's Foreign
Affairs Committee said the Israeli acts will put the region in
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
It urged world parliaments and international organizations to
take a firm stand to put an end to the Israeli aggression.
</P>
<P>
Jordan had claimed it was the first Arab country to show
support of the Lebanese government and the first to mediate
between Lebanon and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti held talks with his Lebanese counterpart Rafik
Al-Hariri by phone a few days ago and voiced Jordan's solidarity
with Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, during his meeting with Lebanese ambassador
to Jordan, also promised to provide the Lebanese refugees with
humanitarian assistance including tents, blankets and medicine.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister had made contacts with his Israeli
counterpart Peres and asked Israel to stop its air and ground
bombardment in south Lebanon which started last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli military operations in south Lebanon, designed to
paralyze the Shiite Moslem guerrilla group Hezbollah in
retaliation for its attacks on northern Israel, have killed about
30 Lebanese and wounded some 100, and forced 20,000 to abandon
their homes and flock to Beirut.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator Qiao Shi
said here today that his country favors dialogues on human rights
on an equal footing and opposes any country exerting pressure on
China.
</P>
<P>
"China would neither impose its own positions on others," the
chairman of the Standing Committee of the Chinese National
People's Congress said during his meeting with Canadian Foreign
Minister Lloyd Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
Qiao and his entourage flew in from Toronto Sunday. He is here
on a 10-day official goodwill visit to Canada. After Ottawa, he
will also visit Regina, Winnipeg and Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting at Axworthy's office in the Canadian parliament
building, Qiao said dialogues on the basis of equality, rather
than confrontations, should be strengthened in handling
nation-to-nation relations.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy said that China has passed some new laws which left a
very deep impression on the Canadians. He expressed the hope that
the two countries could strengthen cooperation between judges and
personnel training.
</P>
<P>
He said that legislators from both countries could meet more
often and have exchanges in various modalities.
</P>

<P>
Extending welcome to Qiao and his party, LeBlanc recalled his

Canada is one of the first Western countries that forged
diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of China, Qiao said. He
expressed satisfaction with the development of the bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the NPC chairman also conveyed greetings to
LeBlanc from Chinese President Jiang Zemin, and expressed the hope

<P>
LeBlanc said that both his predecessors had visited China and
that he wished to go to China soon.

his country is stepping up efforts in legislation, especially
economic legislation, to better serve its economic development.

LeBlanc told Qiao that Canada is ready to enhance its
cooperation with China in areas of legislation and education,
which he said is beneficial to both sides. To this, Qiao expressed
agreement.

LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
now is facing a threat in the run-up to the general election from
Sir James Goldsmith, leader of the Referendum party.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with BBC radio today, Goldsmith pledged to
launch a 20 million pounds (30 million U.S. dollar) campaign to
field 600 candidates in the next general election scheduled for
May 1997.
</P>
<P>
In a response to the Tory government's decision to make a
manifesto commitment to hold a referendum on a single European
currency, Goldsmith said that his candidates will stand in seats
where the Conservative candidates oppose a referendum
</P>
<P>
He argued that the government's decision was "an act of
appeasement within the cabinet to try and keep it stable".
</P>
<P>
He said that he would unveil his full list of candidates at the
party's conference in October.
</P>
<P>
Tories feared that the Referendum party could take 15 to 20
seats away from them at the general election and put Labour in
power.

<HEADLINE> UK Tory MPs Warn Major Against Shift to Right </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Tory members of
parliament on the left-wing have warned Prime Minister John Major
against his his shift to right.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said four Tory left-wingers will switch their
allegiance and at the same time, Britain's opposition Labour
appealed today to wavering Conservative MPs to defect from Major's
government.
</P>
<P>
Tim Rathbone, one of the four Tory left-wingers, warned that he
might quit if the Tories became "absurdly right-wing".
</P>
<P>
Rothbone's colleague Peter Temple-Morris told BBC radio that
the opposition Labour was winning the battle to claim the centre
ground on Britian's arena of politics.
</P>
<P>
Since the defeat in last week's by-election, in which the
government's majority in the parliament was cut to just one, the
conservatives have been further demoralized.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times weekly reported that two Tory MPs on the
left-wing had secret talks with senior figures in Labour shadow
cabinet. The two unnamed Tories were reported to be deeply worried
about Major's shift to right.
</P>
<P>
Since last October, three Tories have quitted from the
Government's whip, one defecting to Labour, another to the Liberal
Democrats and the third sitting as an independent in the House of
Commons.
</P>
<P>
The embattled prime minister has repeatedly vowed to stick to
the term of this parliament until May, 1997, when the next general
election is held.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Africa Coop Remains China's Basic Policy: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official
stressed here today that strengthening Sino-Africa ties remains
one of China's fundamental policies toward Africa.
</P>
<P>
"China and Africa enjoy traditional friendship," said Yang
Wensheng, Assistant Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation who is now heading a Chinese delegation at the
Partners Meeting of the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa
(ECA).
</P>
<P>
"We have long been sharing feelings with and giving support to
each other," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Yang said China is currently reforming its practice of foreign
assistance which is aimed at expanding its economic and technical
cooperation with African countries and enhancing the economic and
social efficiency of those projects financed by the Chinese
government.
</P>
<P>
"In the future, China's foreign aid will mainly take the form
of government concessional loans. China will also provide certain
grants as the case may demand such assistance," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We provide foreign assistance to help recipient governments
to finance those medium and small-sized production-oriented
projects where there are sufficient supply of local resources and
need for the end products," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Yang pointed out that "over the past decades, China has,
within its capability, provided assistance to African countries,
which we regard as one of our international obligations."
</P>
<P>
"We do not condition our assistance on any political demand,
which has contributed our due share to the development of African
economy," he added.
</P>
<P>
The official said the Chinese government would encourage
enterprises from respective countries to enter into joint-equity
or joint-cooperative arrangements with China for the construction
and management of those projects.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the principles of China's economic and
technical assistance toward Africa, i.e., equality, mutual
benefit, provision of assistance in diversified forms, efficiency
orientation and common development.
</P>
<P>
Yang said in recent years, Sino-Africa economic and trade
cooperation moved "on a fast track".
</P>
<P>
The two-way trade volume hit 3.921 billion U.S. Dollars in
1995, 4.19 times over that of 1990.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, China had completed 566 construction
projects for complete plants out of a total number of 725
projects undertaken by China in African countries.
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, China has provided multi-lateral assistance to 42
African countries and provided training to more than 660
technical and managerial personnel in various areas.
</P>
<P>
On top of that, China has deployed 800 people to Africa
working in 35 medical teams, he added.

<HEADLINE> Israel May Consider Diplomatic Efforts to End Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 15 (Xinhua) -- As fighting between the
Israeli army and Hezbollah gunmen continues, Prime Minister
Shimon Peres said here today that Israel may consider any
diplomatic initiative to end the conflict in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Peres made the remarks to reporters before a meeting with
visiting British Defense Secretary Michael Portillo, who arrived
here on Saturday for a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
However, Peres said that so far there is no particular
diplomatic initiative that can end the conflict. "We shall judge
the situation by its realities," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Israel wants to ensure a real peace, not a
peace of paper.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli leader denied charges that Israel is responsible
for the large amount of Lebanese refugees that fled the south of
Lebanon, but blamed Hezbollah (Party of God) for having worsened
the situation.
</P>
<P>
"We are forced to react (to Hezbollah Katyusha rocket attacks
at northern Israel)," said the premier. "We did not create the
problem of the Lebanese refugees."
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Lebanon, more than 400,000 Lebanese
have fled over 50 towns and villages in the south of the country
to escape Israeli military operation against Hezbollah targets,
code-named "Operation Grapes of Wrath," which started last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Portillo, meanwhile, offered full support for Israel's
operation in southern Lebanon, saying the action "is responding
to terrorist threat posed by Hezbollah."
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes carried out strikes throughout today against
Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon, as Hezbollah fired more
Katyusha rockets at northern Israeli towns and villages.
</P>
<P>
Eight were injured during the Katyusha attacks, according to
the Israel Radio report, and several cars and buildings were
damaged.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that in the past few days, more than 28
Lebanese civilians have been killed and nearly 100 others wounded
in the Israeli strikes against the Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri
today held talks in Paris with French President Jacques Chirac in
order to ask for French help to defuse the tension in southern
Lebanon. Lebanon was a French colony before its independence.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has called on the Hezbollah to stop
Katyusha rocket attacks on northern Israel to end the cycle of
violence.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette is due to arrive here
tonight to discuss the situation in southern Lebanon with Israeli
leaders, while Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Karim Kabariti is
scheduled to be here on Tuesday also in this effort.

<HEADLINE> African Oil Trade Conference Opens in Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A three-day African Oil Trade
Conference started here today, with a call for strengthening
management to ensure success of oil trade in the continent.
</P>
<P>
It will focus on how sub-Saharan Africa can promote the role
of African Banks in the oil sector, financing and improving
operations and financing efficiency among oil importers and
traders through techniques in oil marketing, risk management and
finance.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Zimbabwe's Transport and Energy
Minister Simon Moyo pointed out that innovative management was
central to the success of the oil trade in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said many African countries faced oil procurement problems
due to foreign currency shortages.
</P>
<P>
This, he told the delegates, called for aggressiveness in
marketing, risk management and oil financing.
</P>
<P>
Moyo said the fact that oil purchases are denominated in
United States Dollars makes it even more expensive for African
countries to import the product.
</P>
<P>
Sub-Saharan African countries also face transit risks due to
their landlocked position, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The minister said most countries in the region do not have
crude oil reserves, and have no choice but to import.
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, the value of petroleum imports for the
region has been between 10 and 20 percent of the region's total
exports, while for some individual countries, the cost of
petroleum imports has been as high as 70 percent or more of their
total exports.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, the governments have tried to control
the importation and price of oil so as to protect the consumers.
</P>
<P>
President of the Eastern and Southern African Trade and
Development (PTA) Bank Martin Ogang said that sub-Saharan Africa
countries trading in oil lack the skills to effectively manage
their refineries and capital.
</P>
<P>
He said there is need to emphasize on how oil refiners,
importers and end-users could develop and implement practical
solutions to problems faced.
</P>
<P>
He said the PTA Bank is concerned with the challenge of
Africa's capacity to control trade in its own commodities.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Dr. K.Y. Amoako, Executive
Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa
(ECA), said here today that "it is now possible to see a
different Africa, an Africa of renewal."
</P>
<P>
Addressing a three-day consultative meeting on partnership
with ECA, Amoako said, "we are experiencing a new international
economic environment of which Africa is becoming an integral
part," adding, "globally, macroeconomic stabilization is
converging with international economic linkages."
</P>
<P>
"The latest U.N. projections for developing countries shows
gross domestic products growth projected to rise from 2.2 percent
in the past decade to 5.2 percent in the next," he said.
</P>
<P>
Amoako noted that "in the region of sub-Saharan Africa,
expectations for improvement in regional growth over the next
decade to 4 percent per year are conditioned on a number of
assumptions."
</P>
<P>
He described "a number of assumptions" as "a continuation in
the recent pace of reforms, a slower pace of decline in terms of
trade, and a consolidation of civil peace in the sub-regions."
</P>
<P>
Dr. Amoako stated that "Africa requires a renewed ECA," saying
that "we are committed to a major renewal of the organization on
a scale not seen in ECA's history."
</P>
<P>
Referring to ECA's renewal programs, he said the programs
concentrate on five core themes and 2 cross-cutting themes.
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. Amoako, the five themes are facilitating
economic and social policy analysis, ensuring food security and
sustainable development, strengthening development management,
harnessing information for development and promoting regional
cooperation and integration.
</P>
<P>
Two cross-cutting themes are gender, to enhance women's
participation in economic development, and capacity building
within Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of delegates from various countries, U.N. agencies,
international organizations and governmental and non-governmental
organizations attended the meeting.

<HEADLINE> UK Building Industry Sets to Cut 20,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Employers have warned that up to
20,000 jobs could be lost in the building industry in Britain this
year, according to a BBC TV report today.
</P>
<P>
The Building Employers Construction (BEC) made the warning at
the launch of its quarterly construction trends survey.
</P>
<P>
It reported a 0.5 percent fall in construction output in the
first quarter of 1996, with flat growth seen for the year.
</P>
<P>
The BEC said the expected cutback would bring the number of
building jobs lost over the past six years to more than 0.5
million.
</P>
<P>
The construction industry remained in a prolonged state of
recession despite other parts of the economy moving into recovery
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Since the industry sank into recession in 1990, the BEC has
reported annual job losses of 100,000 for the five years to 1995.
</P>
<P>
Its latest report, based on a survey of 600 firms, showed that
margins had continued to decline in the first quarter of 1996 and
that 41 percent of firms surveyed reported less success in
tendering for new work.

<HEADLINE> Manuel Reiterates Gradual Removal of Exchange Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Finance Minister Trevor
Manuel today reiterated that foreign exchange controls in South
Africa would be gradually removed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the South Africa International Development Forum
in Pretoria, Manuel said the timing and sequence of relaxation of
the foreign exchange controls would be worked out by the Reserve
Bank and the Department of Finance.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from more than 130 countries in the world
attended today's conference on international financial aid.
</P>
<P>
"Our stated policy is a gradual removal of the existing
exchange control measures," said the minister, adding the
remaining controlling measures would therefore be steadily removed
in due course.
</P>
<P>
In general and as demonstrated by the recent developments in
the financial markets, Manuel said the opening up of the economy
would entail, at least initially, a certain degree of volatility
stemming from capital flows.
</P>
<P>
However, in his first major speech since taking over as
finance minister early this month, Manuel said the overall
objective is to substantially increase long-term foreign capital
inflows to supplement domestic equity investment in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that both monetary and fiscal policies of the
government would have to be conducted in a coordinated and
credible manner in order to prevent excessive fluctuations of
real exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, South Africa's local currency Rand, which
had been weak for quite a long time, hit its recorded low of
4.1900 against the Dollar in the financial markets.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Helicopters Attack Beirut's South and East Suburbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Helicopters carried out an
air raid at Beirut's southern suburbs at 5:05 p.m. local time
(14:05 GMT) today, the fourth attack of it kind in five days at
the Shiite-Moslem populated suburbs of the Lebanese capital.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, three missiles, believed to be fired by an
Israeli warplane in the Mediterranean water opposite Beirut, which
was enforcing a blockade on the Beirut port, also hit the area,
according to security sources.
</P>
<P>
The missiles hit a dwelling building and a school, and a local
resident was injured.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli helicopters also launched an air raid at
Salim district on the east outskirts of Beirut, destroying a
transformer substation.

<P>
In a related development, the Israeli bombardments at the
southern Lebanese market town of Nabatiyeh and its vicinities were
still sporadicly continuing today.
</P>
<P>
Police sources in the south said one resident in the town was
wounded in the morning bombardments.
</P>
<P>
The police sources said that more than 300 heavy artillery
shells have fallen at various districts of the town since this
morning, causing serious material damages.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli forces today expanded a "death zone" in south
Lebanon, and ordered a departure of all residents in towns and
villages in the areas of Iglim Al-Toffah, Nabatiyeh and south of
Litani River, including Nabatiyeh town and the port city of Sour.
</P>
<P>
All the residents in these areas should leave their houses
before 8:00 a.m. local time (05:00 GMT) or "they will face
dangers," the Isreali army said in an ultimatum, announcing that
this was for intensifying the combat against Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
With the advent of the time limit, the Israeli occupation
forces in the South immediately resumed the bombardments at these
areas.
</P>
<P>
Since the Israeli forces issued the first ultimatum Friday
ordering residents of 41 southern Lebanese towns and villages to
leave their houses, which was followed by a similar order for
residents of 39 more towns and villages, some 400,000 Lebanese
civilians have been forced to escape from their homelands.
</P>
<P>
Israeli jet fighters carried out frequent reconnaissance over
Beirut and its southern suburbs since 1:00 p.m. local time (10:00
GMT) today and broke sound barrier, drawing anti-air fire opened
by Lebanese army units and Syrian troops around the capital with
machine-guns and artilleries.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes also carried out air raids at south Lebanese
towns and villages, destroying some civilian houses and causing
flames to some others.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an airport official reported that some airplanes
carrying relief materials have arrived at Beirut International
Airport since this morning.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has made diplomatic efforts in order to rally
international help of those Lebanese who have been dispelled by
the continuous Israeli aggressions since Thursday from their
homelands in south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> China Calls on Lifting Closure of Gaza, West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador Qin
Huasun today called on Israeli government to lift closure of the
Palestinian territories so as to promote the peace process in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the public debate on Palestine at the U.N. Security
Council, Qin urged the parties concerned to respect and protect
the rights and interest of the Palestinian people, ensure a smooth
progress of the self-governing process and help restore the normal
economic life of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Since the Israeli government sealed off the West Bank and Gaza
in early March, the normal life of Palestinian people has been
affected severely and the Palestinian economy has met great
difficulties, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he expressed sympathy for the victims of the
large-scale terrorist bombs in Israel.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China is opposed to all kinds of terrorism,
which threatens life and security of the people in the countries
concerned and threatens international peace and security.
Terrorists must be punished by law.
</P>
<P>
However, anti-terrorism operations should, like handling other
international issues, follow the norms governing the international
relations and the international law and not violate the
sovereignty, security and basic interest of another country, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the sovereignty and security of all countries in the
Middle East should be respected and ensured on the one hand, and
terrorism should not be linked with Arab countries and people, nor
should the innocent people be punished indiscriminately on the
excuse of anti-terrorism, he added
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation called on all parties concerned to make
joint efforts to realize comprehensive peace in the Middle East,
promote regional economic cooperation and uproot the source of
terrorism.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Hezbollah Calls for "Real Guarantee" for Civilians' Security (Part I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, today stressed the need to
find a "real guarantee" for the security of civilians instead of
the so-called "July understanding."
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Naim Al-Kassem, deputy secretary general of the Shiite
fundamentalist Hezbollah, pointed out here that his party believed
that the "July understanding" in its original form was not
efficient any more due to the recent offensive launched by Israel
in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Under the July understanding, a tacit agreement mediated by the
United States to put an end to an Israeli blitz in south Lebanon
in July, 1993, Israel should refrain from attacking civilian
targets in south Lebanon in exchange for Hezbollah's promise not
to attack Jewish settlements in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
"Now there should be a real guarantee not allowing what has
taken place to repeat, and not allowing an existence of the
migrants dispelled by the (Israeli) aggressions from their
homelands," the Hezbollah senior official underlined in an
interview with the Beirut "Sawt Ash-Shaab" (Voice of the People)
Radio.
</P>
<P>
"It can not be satisfied (to apologize) for a mistake here or a
mistake there, or a wrong aggression which could pass without a
price or punishment, or without a position able to put an end to
the criminal operations against Lebanon's people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Local observers note an apparent shift in Kassem's remarks,
comparing with previous statements announced by other Hezbollah
leaders in which they stressed Hezbollah's commitment to the July
understanding.
</P>
<P>
And the observers say, judging from Kassem's remarks, Hezbollah
might possibly be willing to accept a mediation which could lead
to an Israeli ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he had a specific idea on the "real guarantee,"
Kassem said that consultations were under way among the parties
concerned.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question whether Hezbollah had a plan to enlarge
its response to the enlarging Israeli aggressions in Lebanon, the
Hezbollah official stressed that he "can not announce, through the
press, the details of the plan which should be expressed in the
battlefield."
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that Hezbollah would "respond by firing
Katyusha rockets into northern Israel more intensively and we
will enlarge our strikes at the Jewish settlements in northern
Israel."

<HEADLINE> China Beats Japan in Volleyball Tourney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, Jiangsu Province, April 15 (Xinhua) -- China came from
behind to outplay Japan 9-15, 15-9, 15-13, 15-10 in the second leg
of the four-nation women's volleyball tournament here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese, winner of the first leg with an unbeaten record in
Guangzhou last week, trailed the Japanese 9-15 quickly in the
first set.
</P>
<P>
Spearheaded by veteran Lai Yawen, the Chinese players combined
their tight net blockings with powerful spikes, leveled the match
score by winning the second set 15-9.
</P>
<P>
After the score was tied at 13-13 in the third set, the Chinese
pulled away to take the set 15-13 and then the fourth set 15-10.
</P>
<P>
In the other match earlier, world champion Cuba fought back
from two sets down to beat the Netherlands 15-17, 11-15, 15-3,
15-8, 15-10.
</P>
<P>
The Cubans, led by super star Mireya Luis, were apparently not
in good form, trailing the Dutch squad 4-12 soon after the start
of the game.
</P>
<P>
But they managed to level the score for three times at 12-12,
13-13 and 15-15 before dropping it 15-17.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands maintained their momentum to take the second
set 15-11.
</P>
<P>
Luis was then replaced by teammate Gto Idalmis, who helped turn
the tide and snatched the following three sets.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Soft Drinks Manufacturers
Association of Zimbabwe today announced a six percent price
increase, the second in less than eight months.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the association Steve Kuipa said the industry has
adjusted prices due to escalating input and manufacturing costs
which threaten to erode the industry's viability.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the industry, which last year suffered a six
percent decline in volume sales up to the year ended March 1996,
has been affected by high operational costs since the last price
increase.
</P>
<P>
However, Kuipa said despite the price rise, soft drinks made
and sold in Zimbabwe are still among the cheapest in the region.

LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The British government today
expressed concern over the worsening crisis between Israel and
Hizbollah guerillas in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The British Foreign Office said in a statement the British
government is "disturbed by the increasing effects on civilians
and by the growing humanitarian problems as large number of people
flee from the South".
</P>
<P>
The statement also said that "there can be no justification for
the continued Hizbollah attacks on northern Israel which
precipitated the crisis."
</P>
<P>
"We encourage all the parties to do what they can to break the
cycle of violence and return to a situation permitting a
resumption of negotiations on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks of
peace process," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the British government has decided to send Director
for Middle East Affairs of the Foreign Office John Shepherd to
Beirut for talks with the Lebanese government on the issue.
</P>
<P>
British Defense Secretary Michael Portillo, who is visiting
Israel, was reported by the BBC television as backing the Israeli
government, saying "it is the right of every country to defend
itself."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Israel has launched fresh attacks on
southern Lebanon in response to Hizbollah missile attacks on
northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Lebanese have fled their homes in
southern Lebanon since Israel staged reprisal attacks earlier last
week.

<HEADLINE> Asian Championships, Testing Ground for Chinese Swimmers By Sportswriter Zhou Zongxin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 15 (Xinhua) -- "We've achieved most of our goals
set for this Asian championships and we shall at once switch to
the last stage of our Olympic Games preparations," said Zhou Ming,
deputy head coach of the Chinese swimming team.
</P>
<P>
Zhou made this remark as the Fifth Asian Swimming Championships
closed here today. China is one of the 19 participating teams in
the event.
</P>
<P>
Although the Chinese team did not take the event as a key part
of their warm-up program for the Atlanta Games, they fielded most
of their potential Olympic swimmers except for veteran Lin Li and
new star Liu Limin.
</P>
<P>
Each team could bring to Bangkok at most 20 swimmers, as
required by the championship organizers. Japan instead brought
here their full Olympic Games line-up.
</P>
<P>
Although eight new championships records were set during the
four-day event, both Chinese and Japanese teams noticed a declined
performance of their swimmers compared with the results produced
at their respective national Olympic trials, which closed just
days ago back in Tianjin, north China, and in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
But the Bangkok event served as a testing ground as both China
and Japan, Asia's swimming powerhouses, have recruited in recent
years a batch of young blood for their finalized or would-be
Olympic sides.
</P>
<P>
Among the new faces on the Chinese team were Chen Yan, 15,
national champion for women's 400 and 800 meters freestyle, Nian
Yun, 14, the new Asian champion in women's 200 meters freestyle
here, and Qu Yun, 17, who set a new Asian championships record in
winning the women's 200 meters butterfly.
</P>
<P>
Also on hand were 14-year-old Han Xue, the new star with a
world record at the World Cup short-course series in Hong Kong and
Beijing early this year and new Asian women's 100 meters
breaststroke champion with a new meet record here, and Wu
Yanyan,18, who set a new championships record in taking the
women's 400 meters individual medley title.
</P>
<P>
In the Japanese team were such new blood as Eri Yamanoi, 17,
women's 400 meters freestyle Asian champion, and Hitomi Kashima,
also 17, who took the women's 100 meters butterfly in a
championship record time.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese swimmers will continue their pre-Olympic training
in separate locations such as Beijing, Guangzhou, Nanjing and, for
some swimmers, a special camp in Kunming in southwest China, which
is famed as being the site where the national team's elite
swimmers had successfully carried out their altitude training
programs before many major international events.

has broken the magnetic disk-drive storage barrier of one billion
bits of data a square inch.
</P>
<P>
Significantly, the company said, the new technology would be
applied first in a line of 2.5-inch, nonremovable disk drives
intended for use in portable computers, according to a report of
the New York Times today.
</P>
<P>
The new drive, known as Travelstar, will hold 1.3 billion bits
a square inch and be offered in capacities ranging from 1.08 to
2.16 gigabytes.
</P>
<P>
A gigabyte is a billion bits, equivalent to 62,500
double-spaced, typewritten pages -- which would be 21 feet tall if
stacked.
</P>
<P>
The current 3.5-inch hard drives used in most desktop computers
have densities typically of 400 million bits a square inch.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the technology is another indication of broad
changes now taking place in the computer industry. Now new
technologies are frequently being introduced first by personal
computer and even consumer electronics companies.
</P>
<P>
IBM introduced the world's first disk drive in 1956. Those
systems were capable of storing about 2,000 bits a square inch.
The new Travelstar drives will store information 650,000 times as
densely.
</P>
<P>
The major technology to increase the storage capacity was to
use a new type of magnetic recording head known as a
magneto-resistive head, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Paper: Most U.S. Military Planes Fail to Meet  FAA's Safety Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Most U.S. Air Force transport
planes could not be flown by U.S. commercial airlines because they
lack some safety equipment required by the U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA), according to a report published here today.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion came after former U.S. commerce secretary Ron
Brown was killed when traveling to Croatia aboard a U.S. military
VIP plane.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post said that in fact U.S. Air Force VIP planes
do not meet the requirements the Pentagon imposes on civilian
aircraft it charters to carry troops and cargo.
</P>
<P>
Had the Brown party's T-43A jet been civilian, it would have
been rejected even for charter service to carry pallets of
military rations, the report said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. military aircraft, along with those owned by state and
local governments, are considered "public use" aircraft and
therefore are not subject to certain FAA requirements.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military has rejected all attempts since the FAA was
created in 1957 to bring its transport aircraft under FAA
scrutiny, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Underlines IPU's Role in Promoting International Cooperation (by Zheng Jinfa) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Istanbul, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel today underlined the important role of the
Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) in promoting international
cooperation, democracy and the protection of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Demirel delivered a speech at the opening ceremony of the
five-day 95th conference of the IPU held in Istanbul, Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He said that the common salvation for the whole humanity lies
in a global solidarity and an effective and global consensus.
</P>
<P>
"Whereas the humanity is continuing its way to a more secure,
peaceful, and prosperous world adventure, it is occasionally
encountering seemingly unsurmountable obstacles in the meantime,"
said the president.
</P>
<P>
"As it is not possible to hide within our own boundaries,
deeming our country the only one in the world, and to limit our
vision with that of our boundaries in today's world, it is also
not possible to look for peace, security, stability, democracy and
welfare just for our own sake," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The point is to be able to have these altogether in a
regional, and global manner, because every incident is
influencing every other party," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Essential criterion is being able to find the ways of
reacting in similar manners to similar events. We should not let
the global solidarity impaired by double standard inclinations",
Demirel said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Parliament Speaker Mustafa Kalemli also addressed the
inaugural session.
</P>
<P>
"In the recent past when the cold war was buried in the pages
of history books and when the humanity entered into a new era with
great hopes, we all witnessed terrible examples of new ethnic
clashes, wars, racism, xenophobia, cruelty and intolerance in all
parts of the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We carry a great responsibility to put an end to such
tragedies witnessed by humanity, and to prevent their
recurrence," Kalemli added.
</P>
<P>
He urged the participants to fulfill this duty by acting in
solidarity to strengthen and expand democracy, tolerance,
international friendship and understanding and human rights.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese delegation led by Tian Jiyun, vice chairman of the
Standing Committee of National People's Congress of China, attended
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Over 600 parliament deputies, including 28 speakers, from 115
countries attended the conference which will last until
April 19.
</P>
<P>
The representatives for the conference are expected to discuss
issues such as the protection of minorities in the world, proper
management of fishery resources.

<HEADLINE> Call of Nature to Ease Power Problems for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- China's rural areas are turning
to nature to provide desperately needed energy.
</P>
<P>
Wind-powered generators and solar energy are to be more
extensively used in the coming years as part of a "power to the
people" drive.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years China has spared no effort in developing
new and renewable energies in rural areas, easing energy shortages
and environmental problems in the country.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that energy consumption in China's rural
areas was equal to 600 million tons of standard coal every year,
in which, five percent or 30 million tons was from new and
renewable energy.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that China is rich in new energy and renewable
energy resources. China has a total of 250 million kw of usable
wind power, and solar energy can be easily used in two-thirds of
the country's acreage.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the country faces a major chance of using
geothermal energy, marine energy and bio-gas.
</P>
<P>
A survey from the ministry showed that the country has already
installed 200 wind-power generators, with an annual electricity
producing capacity of 100 million kwh.
</P>
<P>
In Liaoning, a northeastern province, farmers combine
solar-heating huts with planting, breeding and methane gas,
forming a cycling agricultural system.
</P>
<P>
In Ngari Prefecture of Tibet, a power station using solar
energy with an elevation of 4,500 m was set up to meet the needs
of local residents' power for lighting and mains.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has got five million household-sized methane
gas-generating pits and 500 large scale ones, producing 100 cubic
meters of methane gas annually.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several testing geothermal power stations and marine
power stations have been set up in Tibet and southeastern coast.
</P>
<P>
The official admitted that there are still some problems
existing in current energy utilization in the rural areas, noting
that the half of the straw and one-third of woods in the country
were burned as fuel every year.
</P>
<P>
According to him, China will continue to develop new and
renewable energy industry, aiming at producing new and renewable
energy equal to 80 million tons of standard coal by the end of
2000.

<HEADLINE> Christopher Phones Mideast leaders on Lebanon Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher has begun making telephone calls to leaders in the
Middle East in an effort to defuse the latest crisis in the
Israel-Lebanon fronter region, the White House said today.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry, traveling along with U.S.
President Bill Clinton and Christopher to Asia and Russia, told
reporters that Christopher made the calls in the last 48 hours in
a bid to "minimize, and we hope end, some of the violence."
</P>
<P>
Israel is reportedly continuing its bombardment at southern
Lebanon in what it described as retaliatory strikes against rocket
attacks by Hezbollah in the past few days. Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres said in a statement today that he was not ready to
negotiate an end to Israel's air and artillery raids.
</P>
<P>
McCurry disclosed that Christopher phoned Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouk al-Sharaa from Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska,
where his plane stopped for refueling.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official has also spoken with Lebanese Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri and a senior Israeli official, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
But he indicated that Clinton has no immediate plan to get
directly involved in the Israeli-Lebanon conflict.
</P>
<P>
Some Arab nations in the Middle East have criticized the United
States for its support to the Israel's attacks at southern
Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Projects Funded by World Bank in China Well under Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Most of the projects in China
using loans from the World Bank loans are well under way, a senior
official from the bank said today in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
The official was in China's third largest city to attend a
meeting aimed at inspecting the operation of WB-funded projects in
China, and improving management of the funded projects.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was sponsored by China's Ministry of Finance and
the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
According to a WB report submitted to the meeting, China has
become one of the important partners of the World Bank over 15
years of close cooperation between the two.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, the bank had funded 162 projects in China
with contracted loans of 23.13 billion US dollars, 13 billion of
which had arrived in China, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993 China had been using three billion US dollars each
year from the bank, thus becoming the bank's biggest borrower for
successive three years.
</P>
<P>
The projects cover a wide range of sectors such as agriculture,
forestry, water conservation, poverty relief, industry, energy,
transportation, education, public health, urban construction, and
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 28 Chinese provinces, municipalities and autonomous
regions have used funds from the bank.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that between 1981 and 1995, the total amount
of WB loans, and China's counterpart investments, stood as high as
250.5 billion yuan (about 30 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
With such investments, some key projects have played a vital
role in boosting China's national economy and social development.
China has, at the same time, introduced advanced technology and
management with more skillful people.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone's New Ministers Sworn In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Ten of the 24 cabinet ministers
appointed by Sierra Leone's President Tejan Kabbah and approved
by parliament last week took the oath of office at state house
today.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Sierra Leone parliament okayed the appointment
of the 10 while Sheki Bangura, Minister of Development, was
disqualified and the proposed Foreign Affairs Minister Maigore
Kallon and his confirmation "is to be discussed again" on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Among the 10 who were swore in were Finance Minister Thaimu
Bangura, Attorney General Solomon Berewa, Education Minister Dr
Alpha Wurie, Health Minister Dr Mohamed Turay and Marine
Resources Minister Lawrence Kamara.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, President Kabbah warned that "each minister
will be set on a performance target and work plan based on the
predetermined objectives of his ministry."
</P>
<P>
He said there has been a tendency within the past 30 years for
government to be treated as a milking cow by those in position of
authority with only a few having access to the milk."
</P>
<P>
"The new attitude which I demand of you is to regard
government as holding the resources of the state in trust for the
people," Kabbah said.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah said he is "determined to encourage and further enhance
press freedom as the administration abhors a docile and compliant
press."
</P>
<P>
Parliament is now discussing the remaining cabinet positions
which will be out by the end of the week, observers said.
</P>
<P>
The confirmation of the 10 ministers, diplomats said, marks
the "resumption of government services which have been on hold
since Kabbah came to power."

<HEADLINE> Santer Calls for Fight Against Jobless in EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The worrying unemployment
situation is a problem for the European Union (EU) and the fight
against it has become an issue of common concern of European
leaders, European Commission President Jacques Santer said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a Euro-Symposium in Wassenaar, Netherlands, Santer
listed three reasons that Europe must contribute to the fight
against unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, he said, economic growth is the result of a common
strategy such as the one leading to the EMU (Economic and Monetary
Union), aimed at a stable, non-inflationary and sustainable growth.
</P>
<P>
He described it as the second reason that the single European
market is essential for achieving the technological progress,
product and process innovations and the opening up of markets.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, coordinated macro-economic and structural policies in
a highly integrated region stand a bigger chance of success than
the go-it-alone policies.
</P>
<P>
These three points demonstrate that "growth and employment have
a European dimension," Santer said.
</P>
<P>
"Positive interaction between member states, public
authorities, employers and employees should rebuild confidence
among consumers and investors," he concluded.
</P>
<P>
Against this background, Santer stressed the importance of the
Confidence Pact for Employment which he recently proposed.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures from EUROSTAT, the Statistical
Office of the European Communities, the EU jobless rate has been
on the rise over the past few months.
</P>
<P>
In February, the EU unemployment rate was at 11 percent and
EUROSTAT estimated that around 18.3 million people throughout the
EU were out of work.

<HEADLINE> North Mogadishu Court Orders Mercy International To Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic Court of North
Mogadishu has ordered the American aid agency, Mercy
International, to move from its tuberculosis treatment center in
Yaqshid District of North Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The court took the decision after the neighbors of the
treatment facility protested against what they called a toxic
dumping by the agency in their neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
According to the order, Mercy International
should relocate its premises to the former tuberculosis center of
Forlanini Hospital in Karan District of North Mogadishu, where
the court said is safe for both the patients and the ordinary
people.
</P>
<P>
The neighbors around the Yaqshid Tuberculosis Treatment Center
accused Mercy International of handling carelessly the spit exams
they carry from the patients.
</P>
<P>
Mercy International did not respond to the order of the court
so far and there has been no ultimatum given to the agency by the
court.
</P>
<P>
However, Mr Mohamed Ossoble Mohamud, project manager from
Mercy International of the United States, said the court decision
was inappropriate since the prime concern of the agency is to
ensure the health of the people.
</P>
<P>
Mr Mohamud has disputed that the agency dumps the test tubes
in the neighboring garbage collection points. However, he said
the victims of the disease may spit around even though they are
advised against this act.
</P>
<P>
Mr Mohamud, going against the relocation of the agency, said
their treatment center is also beneficial since it is situated
where all the people can reach easily whilst Forlanini would be
difficult for many to get there especially the poor.

<HEADLINE> Higher Domestic Savings Imperative For Growth: Manuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- It is imperative for
domestic savings to rise if South Africa is to achieve a six
percent annual economic growth rate, Finance Minister Trevor
Manuel said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the South Africa International Development Forum in
Pretoria, Manuel said an annual growth rate of six percent a year
is needed to contain the country's unemployment problem.
</P>
<P>
This would require meaningful increases in the domestic
savings and investment patterns in South Africa, said Manuel.
</P>
<P>
To attain this, real positive interest rate policies are
necessary, said the minister, adding the total restructuring of
public sector finances is critical to this end.
</P>
<P>
In his first major speech since taking over as finance
minister in early April, Manuel stressed that the opening up of
the economy would have direct impact on public sector financing
as restrictions on capital inflows and outflows are removed.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the ability of government and the public sector to
attract loan financing at good rates would depend on their record
of managing the funds and on their overall management of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
While reaffirming the government's commitment to fiscal
discipline, Manuel said the financing of the entire public sector
is being transformed.
</P>
<P>
Turning to macro-economic policy, he said internationalization
of the South African economy is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
Reducing unemployment is pivotal to success in many other
socio-economic objectives, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from more than 130 countries in the world
attended the Conference on International Financial Aid.

the United States and Russia are preoccupied with the general
elections in their respective countries.

In the talks with his Russian counterpart Yevgeny Primakov
earlier, Kovacs said he had an impression that Moscow had softened

Conference (CPPCC), today met with an Austrian Federal Council
delegation led by its president Johann Payer.
</P>
<P>
Extending a warm welcome to the Austrian guests, Li said
relations between CPPCC and the Austrian Federal Council have

and opening to the outside world for over a decade cannot be over
estimated.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, he continued, China has been progressing
smoothly, yet problems and difficulties still exist.
</P>
<P>
A long period of arduous work is needed before China can
developed itself to the level of a moderately developed nation, Li
noted.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that China is willing to develop friendly relations
with all countries, including Austria, on the basis of the Five
Principles of Peaceful Co-existence to create a favorable
international environment for its economic construction.
</P>
<P>
He said the current visit of president Payer will promote the
development of Sino-Austrian relations.

anniversary of diplomatic ties between the two countries.
</P>

relations and cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan's History Detailed in New Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The publication of a new book,
"Essentials of Taiwan History" was marked by a forum today at the
Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
It has taken two years for a group of historians and
specialists in Taiwan affairs to complete the book.
</P>
<P>
"The book provides detailed historical data showing that
compatriots from both sides of the Taiwan Straits jointly created
the splendid history and culture of the Chinese nation, and they
shared weal and woe along China's history," a senior official said
today.
</P>
<P>
The remark was made at the forum by Wang Zhaoguo, vice-chairman
of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference, director of the Taiwan Work Office of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and director of
the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The history of Taiwan witnessed Taiwan compatriots' exploration
of the island, and their fight against invasion, suppression and
colonial rule, shoulder by shoulder, with people from the
mainland, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that over recent years, some people in Taiwan, with
the connivance and support of anti-China forces in foreign
countries, attempted "Taiwan independence" and advocated
"splittism and separate rule" in an attempt to create "two
Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
"In accordance with the basic principles of 'peaceful

ministers of Iran and France had telephone conversation today.
</P>

Velayati discussed the tragic situation caused by Israel's

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Calls for "Real Guarantee" for Civilians' Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, today stressed the need to
find a "real guarantee" for the security of civilians instead of
the so-called "July understanding."
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Naim Al-Kassem, deputy secretary general of the Shiite
fundamentalist Hezbollah, pointed out here that his party believed
that the "July understanding" in its original form was not
efficient any more due to the recent offensive launched by Israel
in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Under the July understanding, a tacit agreement mediated by the
United States to put an end to an Israeli blitz in south Lebanon
in July, 1993, Israel should refrain from attacking civilian
targets in south Lebanon in exchange for Hezbollah's promise not
to attack Jewish settlements in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
"Now there should be a real guarantee not allowing what has
taken place to repeat, and not allowing an existence of the
migrants dispelled by the (Israeli) aggressions from their
homelands," the Hezbollah senior official underlined in an
interview with the Beirut "Sawt Ash-Shaab" (Voice of the People)
Radio.
</P>
<P>
"It can not be satisfied (to apologize) for a mistake here or a
mistake there, or a wrong aggression which could pass without a
price or punishment, or without a position able to put an end to
the criminal operations against Lebanon's people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Local observers noted an apparent shift in Kassem's remarks,
comparing with previous statements announced by other Hezbollah
leaders in which they stressed Hezbollah's commitment to the July
understanding.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah's Secretary General Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah announced
on Thursday, the first day of the Israeli continuous air raids and
bombardments in Lebanon, that his party would not accept any
"equilibrium" which Israel wanted to impose through the
aggressions.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hezbollah was a winner in the July understanding,
and it would never accept a new "equilibrium" sought by the Jewish
state by exchanging the security of Beirut in return for a
security of the Jewish settlements in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
"We are the winner in the problem of the security for civilians
in Lebanon and the security for civilians in (Jewish)
settlements," he said. "But the problem of aggressions against the
suburbs (of Beirut) is another problem, and we never accept an
interlock between the two problems."

<HEADLINE> Tax Evasion Rampant On Tanzania-Kenya Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania and Kenya are
losing billions of Shillings yearly through tax evasion on goods
crossing the common border of the two countries daily, a sources
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Investigations in Kilimanjaro and Arusha regions last week
revealed that irrespective of police customs and excise, sales
tax and inland revenue officials' vigilance, specific commodities
continued to cross the border untaxed.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that businessmen in the two countries were
involved in moving the commodities from either country through
official entry points and unlawful routes without paying the
necessary dues.
</P>
<P>
Goods imported from Kenya now flooding shops throughout
Tanzania, include cooking oil, washing soap, tooth paste,
margarine, butter, cosmetics, veterinary and human drugs and
beer.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian products taken to Kenya include maize, beans,
uncured coffee, coffee pesticides, timber, hides and skins,
cardamon, scrap metal (telephone wires, components of
transformers) and cooking pots.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, some businessmen allegedly bribed
border post officials to be allowed to either pay import duty on
few items or pay nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
Between 1993 and 1995, there were 421 cases involving goods
worth 92.2 million Tanzanian Shillings (about 167,000 US dollars)
which were impounded by police as they were being smuggled into
Tanzania. The owners were made to pay necessary taxes.
</P>
<P>
Goods involved during the period under review included 11,795
crates of beer valued at 83.2 million Tanzanian Shillings (about
151,000 US Dollars), soap and other items, while goods impounded
being ferried to Kenya included timber, beans, maize, hides and
skins valued at 5.2 million Tanzanian Shillings (about 9,500 US
Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The sources are worrying that the current rains have created a
conducive atmosphere for the businessmen to use both official and
unlawful routes because the police and customs officials have no
reliable transport means.

Executive and electing the Provisional Legislative Council.
Proceeding from this consensus, they put forward lots of

responsibility for social stability and prosperity should also be
considered.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Former South Korean President
Chun Doo-hwan said here today that he spent about 256 million
U.S. dollars for supporting campaigners in the presidential
election in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Testifying at the second trial session of the graft case
involving him at the Seoul District Court, Chun said that he also
spent some 520 million U.S. dollars out of "contributions" from
businessmen for political purposes and for supporting people
and organizations in all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
Chun, who was arrested on December 3 last year, was indicted
on January 12 on charges that he raised about 900 million U.S.
dollars of secret fund during his 1980-1988 presidency from 42
major business leaders.
</P>
<P>
"The secret fund I raised was a pure political fund in the
collection of which no coercion was employed at all," Chun said
at today's trial.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution said that Chun had 182.3 million U.S. dollars
in securities at the time he stepped down from presidency in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Chun is the second head of state of South Korea to stand trial
on graft charges. Another former president, Roh Tae-woo, who was
taken into custody on November 16 last year after being arrested,
has stood trial three times already as he also faces charges of
receiving 370 million U.S. dollars in bribes from businessmen while
in office.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the graft charges, both Chun and Roh are also
being tried for insurrection and treason for their leading roles
in the military mutiny on December 12, 1979 and the 1980 Kwangju
incident.
</P>
<P>
Chun took power on August 27, 1980, and ruled the country until
February 1988. He was followed by Roh who stepped down in February
1993.

NEW DELHI, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
has placed a one-million-rupee (29,155 US dollars) cap on the
issuance of Stockinvests by commercial banks to any individual for
each capital issue, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The move aims at curbing violations of the existing stockinvest
guidelines by individuals, said the RBI sources.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the RBI inspections and investigations conducted by
the Central Economic Intelligence Bureau revealed infringements of
the guidelines by stockbrokers, corporate bodies and non-banking
finance companies.
</P>
<P>
Banks are reported to have often violated the guidelines by
extending stockinvest funds more than the amount deposited.
</P>
<P>
In some cases, banks colluded with individuals who provided the
bank with a hefty deposit and got large stockinvests in return.

<HEADLINE> Israel Rejects Lebanon's Request for Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres said today that he is not yet ready to negotiate an end to
Israel's air and artillery raids on Lebanon, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Peres told reporters that Israel is not about to issue any
offer though there are other parties that may put forward some
proposals.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Al Hariri has toured Damascus,
Cairo and Paris seeking support for negotiations with Israel. He
said that Israel's air raids are boosting support for Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Hariri called for an immediate ceasefire and Israel's
withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Peres said that there is no time for negotiations now and
the only solution is the implementation of 1993 understandings.
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of Operation Accountability launched by Israel
in Summer 1993, a deal was brokered by U.S. Secretary of
State Warren Christopher between the parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the understanding, Israeli civilians and
Lebanese civilians north of the Israel-declared "security zone"
would be outside the parameters of the fighting between Israel and
Hezbollah. A violation by one side would invite retaliation by the
other.
</P>
<P>
Britain has assured its support to Operation Grapes of Wrath
unleashed by Israel from April 11. In a letter from British Prime
Minister John Major, visiting British Defense Secretary,
Michael Protillo conveyed the message during a meeting here this
morning with Peres.
</P>
<P>
Peres revealed at his weekly cabinet session Sunday that
French President Jacques Chirac had complained to him that
Israel's response had been out of proportion to the Hezbollah
attacks. Chirac visited Lebanon earlier this month.

<HEADLINE> CPC Publishes New Theoretical Periodical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A new major theoretical magazine,
"the Theoretical Frontiers", of the Communist Party of China has
been launched.
</P>
<P>
The Bi-monthly periodical has been established by CPC Central
Party School, former owner of the Party's most authoritative
theoretical magazine "Seeking Truth", which is now under direct
leadership of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Hu Jintao, member of the Standing Committee of CPC Central
Committee and president of the Central Party School, wrote a
forward to the magazine, calling for it to offer scientific
theoretical guidance for the realization of China's trans-century
development goals.
</P>
<P>
China has decided on its social and economic development goals
for the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
"To turn the grand blue-print into reality and bring an
economically developing, politically stable, ethnically unified,
socially progressing, hopeful and vigorous China into the 21st
century we need more scientific and correct theoretical guidance,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with
Chinese characteristics has been proved by practice to be the
premis for China's successes in the past decades of reform and
opening-up to the outside world, and theoretical researchers
should further their devotion to the study, research and education
on Deng's theories.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that "heeding politics" should be an important
principle in the running of the new periodical.
</P>
<P>
One the one hand, he said, the principle of "letting a hundred
flowers blossom, and letting a hundred schools of thought
contend," should be followed, to encourage renovation and probing
by academic researchers, and to promote the healthy development of
academic researches; on the other hand, the party's political
disciplines must be strictly observed, and "we must be especially
clear-minded and tell right from wrong on matters relating to
direction, the overall situation and fundamental principles."
</P>
<P>
Theoretical researchers should also be encouraged to apply
theories into practice, and help solve the new contradictions and
new problems in the course of China's reform and modernization
drive, he said.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held in Beijing today, Gong Yuzhi,
vice-president of the CPC Central Party School, said that the
periodical, intending to "report the latest theoretical trends and
reflect difficult subjects of public concern," will also continue
to explain the question "where China is heading for," which
still exercises the thoughts of many, both inside and outside
China.

<HEADLINE> Donors Back Nepal's Economic Policy: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A group of donors have voiced
strong backing for Nepal's economic development and pledged
financial assistance for it in the 1996-97 fiscal year starting
July, Nepali Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat said today.
</P>
<P>
Mahat, who returned here Sunday from a meeting of the Nepal Aid
Group in Paris, told a press conference here that donor countries
lauded the liberal economic policy of the Nepali government.
</P>
<P>
They pledged a total of 993 million US dollars in assistance
for Nepal in the coming fiscal year at the four-day meeting
organized by the World Bank, he said.
</P>
<P>
The donor countries praised Kathmandu's efforts to restore
fiscal stability in the wake of the recent rapid expansions of
public expenditure in the country, said Mahat.
</P>
<P>
He said the group endorsed Nepal's economic reform program that
stresses reform in the fiscal and public sectors, including
privatization of state-owned enterprises, a tight monetary policy
and financial sector restructuring.
</P>
<P>
According to Mahat, the Nepali government recently adjusted
market prices of certain commodities, such as petroleum products
and chemical fertilizers, on the advice of the donors with a view
to cutting down government subsidies gradually.
</P>
<P>
The 13 donor countries and seven international financial
agencies who attended the Paris meeting agreed to meet again in
about 18 months to review the implementation of aid programs in
Nepal, especially those in the social field, Mahat added.
</P>
<P>
He said that although the donors recognized the importance of
power development in Nepal, most of the pledged assistance was not
specified for any project.
</P>
<P>
Mahat noted that Japan and the Asian Development Bank, both
represented at the Paris meeting, indicated intention to provide
financial support for the 144-megawatt Kali Gandaki hydropower
project in eastern Nepal, but Germany said it wanted to help
finance another medium-capacity power project.

<HEADLINE> IPU President Calls on Governments to Protect Minorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- President of the
Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) Ahmed Fathy Sorour today called on
all the governments to ensure that their national legislation
supports the protection of minorities within their borders.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to states to ratify all international
agreements in this respect while addressing at the inaugural
ceremony of the five-day 95th IPU conference (IPU) in Istanbul,
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Sorour said that the existence of minorities is a universal
characteristics covering almost all countries in the world. "One
can hardly find a country where one or several types of
minorities do not exist," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is due to either historical incidents whether of a
military nature, such as warfare between peoples and countries
ending with geographical borders being set by bilateral or
multilateral agreements, or of a peaceful nature due to religions
or migrations", he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that recent developments in Africa and Europe proved
that this is an everlasting issue in the world.
</P>
<P>
Sorour also said that indiscrimination against minorities is
found to varying degrees throughout the world, which not only
affects the security and well-being of people, but also
constitutes an obstacle to development.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed the fact that national and
international peace, stability, and security are greatly affected
by internal and external issues of minorities.
</P>
<P>
He said that over the past few years the world has witnessed
unprecedented violations of human rights, wide-scale ethnic
conflicts and massive genocide, leading to an influx of refugees,
especially in Europe and Africa.
</P>
<P>
Minorities are not second-class citizens and they have the
right to democracy in the same way as members of the majority, he
added.

<HEADLINE> hka041544 --Roundup: PC Panel's Advice-Seeking Meetings Efficient (by Li Huailin) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Selection Committee of the
Preparatory Committee (PC) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR) held 16 advice-seeking meetings in Hong Kong in the
past two days.
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 people from over 300 local organizations attended
the meetings to offer their suggestions on the methods to produce
the members of the Selection Committee for the first SAR
government.
</P>
<P>
Most of the participants made preparations for the
consultations after they received invitations and put forward a
host of constructive ideas to the panel, showing a strong sense of
being masters of Hong Kong and in pursuit of Hong Kong's smooth
transition.
</P>
<P>
Local media pointed out that the advice-seeking meetings
represent PC's efforts to act out its working principle of
"catering to the Hong Kong people and relying on them" and the
work in the past two days proved the practice was efficient.
</P>
<P>
It is unprecedented for China to adopt two systems in different
regions within one country. The implementation of "one country,
two systems" and "Hong Kong people running Hong Kong" calls for
pioneer spirit and needs the widest possible support of the local
people.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has been in constant consultation with
Hong Kong residents on Hong Kong's future since the Sino-British
Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong was signed in 1984.
</P>
<P>
With the approaching of the July 1, 1997, the preparatory work
for the establishment of HKSAR has entered a key stage. Prominent
tasks include the formation of the Selection Committee which is to
be responsible for selecting the first chief executive and forming
the Provisional Legislative Council, and the establishment of
HKSAR's Court of Final Appeal.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese National People's Congress and the Preparatory
Committee have made decisions on the task and the principle for
producing the Selection Committee. These resolutions are firm and
unshakable.
</P>
<P>
But the specific methods to produce the committee, the
representativeness of the committee and the qualifications for its
members have to be worked out on the basis of soliciting opinions
from Hong Kong People.
</P>
<P>
The meetings organized by the PC Selection Committee Panel last
Saturday and Sunday testified to Hong Kong people's earnest and
devoted attitude in promoting Hong Kong's smooth transition as
well as their wisdom and determination to maintain Hong Kong's
stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
With the unfolding of PC's work, the advice-seeking programs
will follow one by one in Hong Kong communities. The consultations
between the PC panels and the Hong Kong people are expected to be
conducted through more channels and in better ways.

<HEADLINE> Truth Commission Hearings Resume After Bomb Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The historic first hearings
of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission resumed at
11:40 am this morning after a brief disruption caused by a bomb
threat.
</P>
<P>
The commission's first hearings began in the East London city
hall at 10 am on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
The disruption came as the commission's first witness, Nohle
Mohapi, was testifying about the death of her husband, allegedly in
police custody.
</P>
<P>
Police said they had received a call at 10:25 am from a man
with an Indian or black accent, who said there was a bomb in the
hall.
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later the East London newspaper Daily Dispatch
received a call from a white man, saying a bomb would go off in the
hall at 11:15 am.
</P>
<P>
Sniffer dogs were immediately brought into the city hall to
conduct a search for the bomb.
</P>
<P>
Before evacuating the hall, commission chairman Archbishop
Desmond Tutu said: ''We could not make a risk. It makes all of us
aware there are some people who would stop at nothing to stop
this commission from carrying out its work.''
</P>
<P>
A visible upset Tutu told police afterwards that he would not
allow the proceedings to be disrupted by further bomb threats.
</P>
<P>
''If you people say the hall is secured then you must remain
here for 24 hours until we have finished the hearings,'' said
Tutu, adding he would not allow a disruption of this kind to
happen again.

BEIRUT, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli bombardments at the
southern Lebanese market town of Nabatikyeh and its vicinities
were still continuing today, police sources in the south said that
one resident in the town was wounded.
</P>
<P>
The police sources said that more than 300 heavy artillery
shells have fallen at various districts of the town since this

Nabatiyeh and some other places south of Litani River.
</P>
<P>
Since the Israeli forces issued the first ultimatum Friday
ordering residents of 41 southern lebanese towns and villages to
leave their houses, followed by a similar order for
residents of 39 more towns and villages, some 400,000 Lebanese
civilians have been forced to escape from their homelands and
reduced to refugees.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes also carried out air raids at south lebanese
villages this morning, destroying a number of civilian houses and
setting some others ablaze, while Israeli jet fighters roared over
the Lebanese capital this morning.
</P>
<P>
An airport official announced that earlier this morning French
and Syrian planes carrying relief materials arrived in Lebanon, an
 plane from Egypt also landed at the Beirut international airport
around 10:30 a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
Airport official expected that more relief materials would be
ferried to Lebanon soon.

JOHANNESBURG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The African National
Congress (ANC) of South Africa today welcomed the first hearings

However, Carolus said the ANC did not expect the process of
truth and reconciliation to be easy, either for the victims of
apartheid crimes or their perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
''We call on all South Africans regardless of background or
affiliation to respect the integrity and legitimacy of the
commission and to acknowledge the importance of the commission's
work in the transformation of South Africa,'' said Carolus.

<HEADLINE> India's Janata Dal Aims To Replace Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 15 (Xinhua) -- India's Janata Dal party said
today that the historical task of replacing the ruling Congress
Party and keeping the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
at bay rests with Janata Dal, its national front allies and left
parties.
</P>
<P>
The challenge is nothing less than accomplishing a political
transition to the post-Congress India, while steering clear of
"communal and reactionary elements," the Janata Dal said in its
election manifesto released today.
</P>
<P>
The historical task of replacing Congress and keeping the
Bharatiya Janata Party at bay "devolves squarely on" Janata Dal,
the manifesto said.
</P>
<P>
While admitting that liberalization was helping to create a
competitive environment to improve supplies and manage shortages,
Janata Dal's manifesto said this opportunity was being squandered
by business groups indulging in speculative practices and
manipulation of stock markets.
</P>
<P>
These negative tendencies must be checked to make
liberalization a success, it said.
</P>
<P>
Opposing the concept of winding up the Public Sector Units
(PSUs) in the country, the manifesto said it would favor giving
autonomy to PSUs through professional management.
</P>
<P>
As part of its alternative economic strategy, the Janata Dal's
emphasis would be on labor-intensive technology to maximize
employment generation.
</P>
<P>
The Janata Dal also promised a variety of measures to protect
religious minorities, the poor and women.

<HEADLINE> hke041529 --News Analysis: Bangladeshi Caretaker Gov't Duty-Bound  to Revive Economy (by Jiang Xianming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's impaired economy is
calling for immediate attention from the caretaker government,
which was set up 10 days ago with a definite mandate to supervise
free and fair general elections in the country.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the caretaker government is duty-bound to
revive the country's economy because a stable and congenial
atmosphere is needed for holding a free and fair election.
</P>
<P>
Adviser to the caretaker government for finance and planning
Wahiduddin Mahmud met with representatives of major donor agencies
and countries last Tuesday in an effort to seek ways to mend the
tattered economy.
</P>
<P>
He told the representatives that the caretaker government was
determined to revitalize the national economy with a "damage
management strategy" in the three-month mandated period.
</P>
<P>
"Our main assurance to donors was that we will leave a
reactivated economy for the next elected government with the down
sliding of macro-indicators reversed," he said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The assurance followed a warning by the World Bank that
Bangladesh, with its poor progress in project implementation, was
in a "highly disadvantageous" position in competing for future
allocation from the International Development Association, the
bank's soft loan window.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has greatly suffered in the last two years from the
political conflict between the then ruling Bangladesh Nationalist
Party and the opposition led by the Awami (People's) League.
</P>
<P>
The political struggle triggered a series of opposition-called
strikes or strike-like agitation programs, which caused colossal
damage to the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Production, income and employment declines, falls in exports
and foreign investments and erosion of confidence among overseas
partners reached a staggering level, which makes it difficult for
the problems to be repaired in the immediate future.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Bangladesh's foreign exchange reserve has dipped
to 2.24 billion US dollars from a record 3.4 billion last April
while its inflation rate has now exceeded eight percent, double
the figure last June.
</P>
<P>
The country's export sector was the worst hit in the political
crisis as millions of dollars of orders from foreign buyers were
canceled in the past year.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement Thursday, the Bangladesh Garment
Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) pressed for
emergency steps to remedy the crippled garment sector, which
contributed 64 percent of the country's total export earnings and
provided 1.2 million jobs.
</P>
<P>
Most of the BGMEA member factories are partially or fully
closed and almost all the factories could not pay the overhead
charges like salaries, rents, and bills for gas, telephone and fax
in the last two months.
</P>
<P>
The caretaker government exchanged views with business leaders
four days after its formation in an emergency effort to redress
the economic problems.
</P>
<P>
The government has planned to set up an inter-ministerial group
for constant dialogues with members of the business community to
solve their problems at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
The Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry
has also promised to constitute a core group of business people to
keep liaison with the inter-ministerial group.
</P>
<P>
The Securities and Exchange Commission has finalized a set of
regulations aimed at reviving the country's capital market to
guide the financial intermediaries.
</P>
<P>
The government has devalued the Bangladeshi currency taka by
more than one percent against the US dollar as a first step
towards redressing the export sector.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the caretaker government's priority on reactivating
the economy would help Bangladesh overcome the damages made by
political events," said Elimi Watanabe, coordinator of the United
Nations missions in Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
In a radio and televised speech to the nation Saturday
night, Chief Adviser to the caretaker government Muhammad Habibur

order in the country, it was also the government's duty to give an
impetus to the economic activities.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government has taken steps to curtail excess
spending in order to set aside fund for productive sectors and has
kept strict vigil on the industrial sector, particularly on
ensuring unhindered supplies of raw material to the garments
industries.

<HEADLINE> IFP Not To Take Part In S. Africa's Truth Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Inkatha
Freedom Party (IFP) will not take part in the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission, which is to hear evidence of more than
30 years of human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi in a
statement that was made public in Durban today.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission,
chaired by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, began its first hearings in
East London.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi said that after careful consideration the IFP had
decided it was impossible for it to receive impartial treatment
by the commission.
</P>
<P>
''As a consequence, and regretfully, we have concluded that
the IFP will play no role in the truth commission's hearings,
questions or deliberations,'' said Buthelezi, adding his party,
however, would recognize and support the rights of individual
party members to appear before the commission in their personal
capacity.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi claimed that about 12,000 IFP members and about 430
of its leaders had been murdered in the past decade, therefore
the IFP had ''as much interest as any party in reaching the truth
of South Africa's recent history''.
</P>
<P>
He said the IFP was the victim of a so-called ''people's war''
conducted by the former United Democratic Front (UDF), the
African National Congress (ANC) and its allies against the IFP
and the people of Kwazulu/Natal in particular.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the political violence between the ANC
and IFP in Kwazulu/Natal had claimed the lives of about 20,000
since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the IFP also questioned recent appointments to the
commission, saying Desmond Tutu himself was a former patron of
the ANC's internal front the UDF.
</P>
<P>
However, the IFP said as a party it would remain fully
committed to the process of reconciliation in South Africa, said
Buthelezi.

HONG KONG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A public leisure garden in the

Kong's Architectural Services Department, according to today's
Hong Kong Standard.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Adopts Measures To Counter Rebel Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 15 (Xinhua)-- Sri Lanka's security forces have
adopted a series of measures to counter Tamil rebel attacks on
supply lines used by government forces stationed in the North and
East, military sources said today.
</P>
<P>
According to military intelligence sources, the rebels of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have already stepped up
operations to cripple sea supply routes to northern Jaffna
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
This has posed a serious threat to the forces, particularly as
the rebels were using suicide squads, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of troops stationed in the North and the East depend
heavily on the navy for supplied of arms, ammunition, food and
other goods.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been trying to prevent these supplies from
reaching the army by attacking naval convoys.
</P>
<P>
The navy has lost some vessels during a series of rebel
attacks, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting a 13-year guerrilla war for a
separate Tamil state in the north-east of the island country.

<HEADLINE> Israel Expands "Death Zone" in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli forces has expanded again a
"death zone" in south Lebanon, and ordered the departure of all
residents in towns and villages in the areas of Iglim al-Toffah,
Nabatiyeh and other places south of the Litani River.
</P>
<P>
All the residents in these areas should leave their houses
before 8:00 a.m. (0500 GMT) or "they will face dangers," the
Israeli forces said in an ultimatum, announcing that this was for
intensifying combat against the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of
God.
</P>
<P>
With the advent of the time limit, the Israeli occupation
forces in south Lebanon immediately resumed intensive bombardments
at these areas.
</P>
<P>
This was the third step of the Israeli forces to expand the
"death zone" after they ordered the residents of 41 southern
Lebanese towns and villages to depart their houses Friday. On
Sunday, they ordered the residents of more than 39 towns and
villages to leave their homes.
</P>
<P>
Israel's "death zone" tactics and continuous bombardments and
air raids have forced more than 400,000 south Lebanese residents
to leave their homelands and reduced them to refugees.
</P>
<P>
On the coastal highway from Sour to Saida, then to Beirut,
thousands of cars jammed together and moved northward slowly.
</P>
<P>
Police sources in the north reported that hundreds of cars,
carrying whole families and their simple possessions from south
Lebanon as well as Beirut's southern suburbs, arrived Sunday night
 at the north's biggest city of Tripoli, 100 kilometers north of
the Lebanese capital.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities had not been prepared for their surprising
arrival and accommodation could not be facilitated. Therefore,
those people had to sleep in the open, tolerating hunger and
chilly winds of early spring.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee students' safety, and also to accommodate the
refugees in classrooms, the lebanese government announced Sunday
an extension of the East holiday vacation in schools to
the next week.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Raffik al Hariri presided over a meeting of the
 Higher Committee for Relief for adopting measures to help the
refugees.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a confrontation between the Israeli forces and the
Shiite fundamentalist Hezbollah was continuing in south Lebanon on
the fifth consecutive day.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah announced that its "martyrdom fighters" haved hurried
to the front, in order to eliminate, with bombs and bodies of
blood and flesh, "the Zionist enemy and the United States, in a
revenge for the massacres committed by the Israeli forces with
U.S.-made weapons."
</P>
<P>
"Al-Manar" television, organ of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah,
broadcast Sunday night a footage, showing an oath-taking ceremony
of some fighters who pledged to sacrifice lives.
</P>
<P>
In the pictures, seven Hezbollah members, in camouflage
uniforms and with faces veiled by black cloth, received one by
one bombs from a man looking like a leader.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah's Secretary General Sheikh Hassan Nasrallsh announced
 Saturday night a general mobilization, and called on all its
members to be ready to retaliate the Israeli aggression.
</P>
<P>
Red Cross sources reported that 28 people have been killed and
more than 100 wounded in the continuous Israeli air raids and
bombardments against the Lebanese people.

<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- China will allocate more than 10
billion yuan (about 1.2 billion U.S. dollars) by the year 2000 to
promote compulsory education in poor areas in China.
</P>
<P>
Liu Bin, vice-minister in charge of the State Education
Commission (SEC), said this at a meeting commemorating the 10th
anniversary of implementation of the Law on Compulsory Education
held here today.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the state financial allocation has become the
main source of educational expenses, with subsidies collected
through various channels.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Kaixuan, minister in charge of the SEC, said that shortage
of funds has become the most serious problem that China is facing
while making efforts to basically popularize nine-year compulsory
education and basically eliminate illiteracy among people aged
from 15 to 45, by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
Zhu urged to increase the state investment in basic education
and try to realize the goal that state financial educational
expenses make up four percent of the Gross National Product (GNP),
which was adopted at a national educational conference held in
1994.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also called for legislation on educational input in order
to ensure stable sources and continued increase of educational
funds by clearly defining responsibilities of governments at all
levels and relevant departments.

LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Female prisoners in Britain have
increased by 57 percent over the past three years, two times the
rise rate for the male prison population, according to a report
produced by the Penal Affairs Consortium (PAC), an umbrella group
dealing with prison issues.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the number of female prisoners rose to a
record 2,125 on December 1, 1995 from 1,353 at the end of 1992 and
the total prison population rose from 49,606 to 52,731 over the
same period.
</P>
<P>
The PAC chairman, Paul Covadino, attributed the rise to the
"growing mood of toughness" in penal policy, which he described as
unwarranted.
</P>
<P>
The PAC is demanding an end to jail terms for those women
convicted of minor offenses like non-payment of fines.
</P>
<P>
The PAC also disagrees with the British government on the
greater use of prison sentences, and its views are widely shared
by probation officers and prison reform groups, according to the
Financial Times newspaper today.

<HEADLINE> India to Make Company Boards Liable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has
proposed to incorporate two provisions in the Indian Penal Code
(IPC) to make companies' boards liable, an official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The new provisions would place the onus on the board of
directors of a company to prove that they had no role to play in
business decisions taken by an employee, which resulted in
violation of penal provisions. This means that not only individual
employees who committed the penal offenses but also the board of
directors would come under the purview of IPC provisions on fraud,
forgery and other offenses, the official said.
</P>
<P>
This imposes a constructive liability on the board, making it
responsible for supervising policies cleared by it. At present,
IPC provides for prosecuting individuals committing two types of
white-collared crimes -- fraud and forgery. There is no legal
recourse in IPC for booking the corporate management that has
cleared the decision.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Israeli Media Stand for Offensive against Lebanon (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ma'ariv, a Hebrew evening newspaper, said that the government
could no longer restrain itself, if it did not want to bring on
itself -- on the eve of elections -- deadly criticism of its
lapses in the north.
</P>
<P>
The editors of the paper said that Israel had to give (Syrian
President Hafez) Assad a chance to rein in Hezbollah, but
regrettably "he did not do so."
</P>
<P>
The paper acknowledged that "the attack will not solve the
problem of southern Lebanon," and "it will only be solved after
a peace agreement with Syria will be achieved, if it is
achieved."
</P>
<P>
However, the paper reminds the government that "Israel's
strategic objective ... is the threatening regime of the
Ayatollahs in Tehran, and ... the entire western world must now
take part in a campaign against Tehran."
</P>
<P>
"In three, five, or 10 years, when the Iranians will be able to
equip Hezbollah with missiles with nuclear warheads," it warned,
"everything that occurs today is child's play."
</P>
<P>
Yediot Ahronot, another Hebrew evening newspaper, observed that the
solution is of a political nature and is made up of
several elements.
</P>
<P>
It suggested that primarily, there should be an immediate
ceasefire in south Lebanon for an unlimited period of time, and
a cessation of all Hezbollah activities and bombardment against
Israeli communities.
</P>
<P>
"The solution should also include a graduated IDF withdrawal
to the international border with the entry of Lebanese army to
these areas, integration of the south Lebanon Army there, and the
complete disarming of Hezbollah," it said.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post, a pro-rightwing English-language newspaper,
 sounded a different tone, saying that the purpose of the current
campaign against Hezbollah is said to be "to teach them a
lesson," and Israel's hope is that once the organization suffers
large losses in men and severe damage to its installations, it
will "think twice" before shelling Israeli towns.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, it said, the likelihood of such a "felicitous
outcome" is slim.
</P>
<P>
The paper said: "On the ground it may be necessary
to extend the security zone -- as Tsomet Member of Knesset
Rafael Eitan has suggested -- to include the Litani bridges.
Control of these bridges will prevent bringing Katyusha rockets
within the range of Israel."
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps even more important, it is time to recognize the
nature of Hezbollah attacks for what they are -- a war of

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Israeli Media Stand for Offensive against Lebanon (by Huai Chengbo) (I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli newspapers have all
expressed support for Operation Grapes of Wrath unleashed from
April 11, but noted editorially that, in the final analysis, a
solution rests only with political means.
</P>
<P>
Davar Rishon, a Hebrew newspaper, said that Operation Grapes of
Wrath is aimed at "not to allow Hezbollah to continue to
abuse its citizens who live in the northern part of the
country" and the offensive shows that Israeli leaders have
learned the tactical lessons of previous Lebanese operations --
not to deploy ground forces beyond the security zone.
</P>
<P>
On the political level, it said, lessons have also been
learned, and the restraint shown during the past month has proven
itself: Israel appears to the world as a country which exhausted
all diplomatic alternatives before acting, but not as a country
acting out of revenge.
</P>
<P>
The paper continued to say that the question now is whether Israel
can translate these tactical achievements into strategic success.
No military operation -- no matter how successful-- can destroy
Hezbollah or silence its ability to fire Katyushas at the
Galilee.
</P>
<P>
It can be assumed, the paper said, that Israel's leaders
are seeking to achieve an arrangement under which the governments
of Syria and Lebanon commit themselves, with an American
guarantee, to prevent attacks on northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
But the editors warn that such an arrangement will --
inevitably -- be temporary.
</P>
<P>
The paper emphasized that a permanent solution will be
achieved only when Israel and Lebanon sign a peace agreement,
under which the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) withdraw to the
international border, and the Lebanese army deploys in the area
north of the border.
</P>
<P>
It noted that both the Israeli and Lebanese governments have
alluded to this solution in public statements over the last few
days.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz, another Hebrew daily, said that "there is no need
for wide-ranging ground operations. The tactical contact during
Israel Air Force operations is faster and quicker than any
penetration by ground forces, which will become bogged down in
... the Lebanese mud."
</P>
<P>
"The official American position -- which shares the Israeli
view that peace in Beirut depends on quiet
in Kiryat Shemona -- has given the government in Jerusalem a
great deal of latitude within American public opinion," the paper
said in an editorial.

<HEADLINE> Rules Promulgated on Work of CPC Grass-Roots Organizations in Universities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese universities and colleges
will introduce the system under which presidents assume full
responsibility under the leadership of the committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), according to a set of rules
promulgated by the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Rules Governing Work of CPC Grass-Roots Units in
Institutions of Higher Learning state that Party committees
exercise unified leadership over work in such institutions and
support presidents in independently performing their duties in
accordance with China's Education Law and ensuring the fulfillment
of teaching, research and administrative tasks.
</P>
<P>
The Rules state: "Party Committees in institutions of higher
learning must take Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and Deng
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics as their guidance, implement to the letter Party's
basic line and principles on education, consistently follow the
guideline that the education must serve the socialist
modernization drive and must be combined with production and
labor, and train successors to and builders of the socialist cause
with all-round moral, intellectual and physical development."
</P>
<P>
The 31-article Rules have eight chapters, namely, general
provisions, the establishment of Party organizations, the duties
of Party organizations, education, management and enrollment of
Party members, work of Party officials, ideological and political
work, Party organizations' leadership over mass organizations, and
supplementary provisions.

<HEADLINE> HK to Hold Textiles Consultation with Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will hold two-day
consultations with Turkey in Geneva Tuesday and Wednesday over the
imposition of unilateral quantitative restrictions by Turkey on
the imports of certain textiles and clothing products from Hong
Kong, the Hong Kong Trade Department announced today.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Director-General of Trade Rebecca Lai will lead the Hong
Kong delegation to the consultations.
</P>
<P>
"The Hong Kong government considers that the unilateral
quantitative restrictions imposed by Turkey are inconsistent with
the principles of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariff (GATT)
and the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Textiles and
Clothing (ATC)," Lai said.
</P>
<P>
She said the Hong Kong delegation would urge Turkey to rescind
its unilateral action and to explore other alternatives which are
consistent with the GATT and the ATC.
</P>
<P>
Lai said important principles were at stake in this case
although the volume of Hong Kong trade affected was small.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong was first approached by Turkey in mid-August last
year on entering into an agreement regarding the establishment of
quantitative restrictions on export of certain textiles and
clothing products from Hong Kong as from January 1 this year.

<P>
LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading British newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Farmers joined furious Tory backbenchers and Euro-MPs on
Sunday in calling for an end to the European Union's ban on
British beef after Franz Fischler, European agriculture
commissioner, admitted it was safe to eat.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The European Monetary Institute (EMI) believes that
countries which fail to adopt a European single currency should
not be forced to tie their currency too tightly to it. The EMI is
calling for any new exchange rate mechanism to be flexible, with
"relatively wide" bands in which non-Emu currencies could move.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- A report from the U.N. Human Rights Commission says that
Britain needs to toughen its laws to combat racism and it calls
for laws to specifically target harassment and racial violence.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- Labor is planning to relax controls over British Gas by
scrapping the power industry regulator. Labor Energy Spokesman
John Battle said a new Labor government would work closely with
the companies and encourage them.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- The Tories could lose between 400 and 700 seats and control
of at least two of their true-blue councils in the local elections
on May 2.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets J.P Morgan Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, APRIL 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin met
here today with Douglas A. Warner, chairman and Chief Executive
Officer of J.P Morgan of the United States, hoping that the
world-renowned monetary firm would expand its business in China
and strengthen its cooperation with Chinese government
institutions and enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Jiang praised J.P Morgan as a world-renowned and trusted firm
and a firm known to quite a few Chinese enterprises. China
appreciated Morgan's efforts in strengthening cooperation with
relevant Chinese departments and firms in the past years, Jiang
said, adding that J.P Morgan has also contributed to the financing
efforts overseas and to the successful issuing of bonds by the
Chinese government and some monetary institutions.
</P>
<P>
With the deepening of China's reform and opening up as well as
the gradual establishment of China's socialist market economy,
China needs more capital for its economic development. Although
china's domestic monetary market is developing, it is still in its
initial stage. Therefore, it is imperative to learn from useful
experience of foreign countries, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Warner said he was happy that China's economy continues to grow
at a high speed while inflation has been effectively
checked. Morgan would continue to play its role in financing for
China's economic construction and rendering services for
international clients in their move to invest in China, he added.

<HEADLINE> Almost All School-Age Girls in China Go to School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- China has solved a problem which
is facing many developing countries by sending 98.2 percent of
all its girls at school age to school.
</P>
<P>
Liu Bin, vice-minister in charge of the State Education
Commission (SEC), said that China has made a remarkable
achievement in offering education opportunities to girls.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting on the 10th anniversary of the implementation of
the Law on Compulsory Education held here today, Liu said that
the enrollment rate for girls was only 0.7 percentage points lower
than that of school-age boys. The difference between boys and
girls in enrollment rate, however, was 4.6 percentage points in
1986.
</P>
<P>
Boys and girls used to be treated unequally in education
because of unbalanced economic developments between eastern and
western parts, urban and rural areas in China, and different views
on education for girls. Only 15 percent of all girls at school age
went to school when new China was founded in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that in the early 1990s, two out of three
children who could not go to school were girls, and two out of
three dropouts were girls, too.
</P>
<P>
China tried hard to perfect the overall educational environment
to help more school-age girls go to school. Relevant laws and
regulations promulgated during the past few years all cover
stipulations about girl children's right to school.
</P>
<P>
Northwest China's Gansu Province encouraged farmers in poor
mountainous areas to run private schools. Flexible teaching was
adopted to give lectures to girls at their home if the school was
too far away from their homes, or the girls had too much chores to
do, or their families were too poor to send them to school.
</P>
<P>
Mobile classes, or "classroom on horse back", and literacy
class for girls, appeared in pastoral areas in northwest China's
Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
Currently girl students make up 47.3 percent of all children at
school in China.

<HEADLINE> Education for Housewives in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- "Our ancestors never had access to
information such as how to prevent or treat diseases that children
often have," said Cezholma, a Tibetan housewife, who finished a
special training course recently.
</P>
<P>
The class was offered by Tibet University and the autonomous
region's bureau in charge of foreign trade and economic
co-operation to provide an education for housewives in eight
villages of Tingri County, which is near to the world's highest
mountain.
</P>
<P>
The training mainly deals with teaching housewives how to raise
their children in a more scientific way and provides them with
basic knowledge of hygiene.
</P>
<P>
"Not only have we found that it is necessary for children to
receive an education, but that it is also necessary for us to be
better educated," housewives have concluded after several months
of learning.
</P>
<P>
The peasants in Zage Village have hardly any opportunity to get
any knowledge because of the inaccessibility of the village.
</P>
<P>
"The lessons we've learned are really applicable and make us
considerably more aware," Damzim, another housewife of Zage
Village, pointed out, adding that not a few of her companions have
asked for textbooks so that their husbands and children who can
read can help them learn at home.
</P>
<P>
According to an official with the autonomous region's Women's
Federation, the intention of household education is to lay a solid
foundation for the growth of future generations of Tibetans by
educating housewives.

BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- In June 1992, the Russian
minister of Culture visited China and reached a co-operative
agreement for 1992 and 1993, and when President Boris Yeltsin
visited China the same year, a cultural co-operation agreement was
signed.
</P>
<P>
This marked the beginning of a new era of Sino-Russian cultural
exchanges, which have developed smoothly over the past few years
with non-government and local exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1993 Russia sent 67 groups with a total
of 1,136 artists to China and some 48 Chinese groups, with a total
of 599 artists, were sent to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, the countries' culture ministries have signed
agreements or memoranda annually and have kept close contact,
increasing mutual understanding and stimulating cultural exchange
programs.
</P>
<P>
Through concerted efforts, government exchange programs have
been carried out and non-governmental, local exchanges have been
playing a dominant role, accounting for over 80 percent of the
whole.
</P>
<P>
From 1992 to 1995, China and Russia had 244 art group
exchanges, with a total of 4,340 artists. Russian folk dance and
circus troupes are the major performers coming to China,
accounting for some 90 percent of the troupes coming here.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the Moiseyev dance troupe visited China, 42
years after having made its debut here, and gave performances in
Beijing, Shanghai, and Qingdao. Chinese President Jiang Zemin
attended the premiere and praised the troupe for its virtuosity.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Chinese Ministry of Culture pointed out
that the number of art troupes being sent to Russia is relatively
smaller than of Russian groups coming to China, and to change this
situation, China will try to look into new markets there.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that China will continue to introduce
performances from Russia to help the Chinese people better
understand its culture.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian NGOs Take New Move to Help Iraqi Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Some 20 Malaysian
non-governmental organizations (NGO) today launched the second
campaign to raise funds for Iraqi children who badly need food and
medicine.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the campaign told a press conference in Petaling
Jaya near the capital that the campaign was launched because the
conditions were getting worse in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, they urged Malaysians to donate any forms of
aid, especially cash and medicine, to the Iraqi children.
</P>
<P>
"The NGOs decided to launch the second campaign as we realize
the United Nations has no intention to lift the trade sanctions
against Iraq at present," NGOs said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, vice-president of the Non-Aligned Students and Youth
Organization N. Bossoondyal today also urged Malaysians to be more
concerned about the need of Iraqis especially children who have
been denied education, food and medical aid.
</P>
<P>
He said only 22 schools have been built in Iraq out of 13,975
in need of repair, adding that a campaign worldwide should be
launched to help revive education for children in Iraq which has
been neglected.

<HEADLINE> 15 Tanzanian Coffee Farms Privatized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen coffee farms in
Hai and Moshi districts in Kilimanjaro region, northern Tanzania,
have been privatized and some placed under joint venture to bail
them out of financial constraints.
</P>
<P>
The local paper "Daily News" reported today that the move
follows a resolution by the Regional Development Committee in
March last year which directed primary cooperative societies,
under whose management the farms were placed, to look for
enterprises or individuals willing to invest in coffee production
and other crops.
</P>
<P>
Following the resolutions, the Regional Agriculture Department
in collaboration with the Kilimanjaro Native Cooperative Union
directed managements of the 29 nationalized farms to apply for
new title deeds after the revocation of the old ones in 1983.
</P>
<P>
The privatization of the farms was deemed necessary by the
regional authorities in Moshi after it was found the farms
management had uprooted coffee trees and leased the land to
individuals to cultivate seasonal crops such as maize and beans.
</P>
<P>
The 29 coffee farms were nationalized in 1973.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government will
provide 9.463 million Canadian dollars within five years for a
project to improve the knowledge and skills of people working in
the field of statistics in China.
</P>
<P>
The plan to modernize China's statistics system was revealed by
Du Weiqun, deputy director of the International Cooperation
Department of the State Statistics Bureau (SSB) in an exclusive
interview with Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement between the Canadian International
Development Agency and China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation, Statistics Canada and its Chinese
counterpart will sponsor pilot and demonstration projects, and
seminars and on-the-job training both in China and in Canada, to
help Chinese personnel working with statistics gain experience in
their field from the Canadians.
</P>
<P>
Canada will also provide some hardware and equipment to support
the training project, the "Statistical Information Management
Project," Du said.
</P>
<P>
One of this year's plans is to hold a seminar, a place where
experts from both sides can discuss China's price statistics
system, including inflation indicators, he said.
</P>
<P>
The program will also seek to strengthen SSB's role as an
overall coordinator of statistics work in China, making the bureau
more client-oriented and improving its public image.
</P>
<P>
"Attempts to achieve this goal include revising the statistics
law, which was developed in 1983, and a seminar to bring officials
of SSB, experts from other government statistics agencies, major
data users, and respondents of surveys together with Canadian
experts for a thorough review of China's statistics system," he
noted.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Firms Eye Three Gorges Dam Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Some big companies from China's
east coast have shown an increasing interest in the Three Gorges
Dam area and have put about 1 billion yuan into it
</P>
<P>
One of the first to arrive, Hangzhou's Wahaha Group, a
health-care products producer from Zhejiang Province, put 40
million yuan (4.8 million US dollars) in Fuling to improve three
money-losing firms, by forming a new company. Last year, the new
company realized a total sales volume of 100 million yuan, with a
pre-tax profit of 1.2 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
An expert says that the area's rich natural resources, lower
labor costs, and vast market have gotten 20 big firms such as
Wahaha and Yanwu, an appliance manufacturer in Jiangsu, and
Baimao, a chemical producer in Shanghai, to invest 600 million
yuan in the area.
</P>
<P>
Another big beneficiary in the dam area has been a diesel
engine manufacturer in Wanxian County, which is cooperating with a
major company from Jiangsu Province. The cooperative venture is
expected to produce 1,000 diesel engines, and make 10 million yuan
in taxes and profit this year.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the dam area said the investors will not only
bring money, but also famous brand products that can be produced
there, thus upgrading local enterprises.
</P>
<P>
An official with the dam said new companies have also helped
resolve the tough task of re-locating local residents from the dam
site, citing the new Wahaha Company in Fuling, which has employed
900 and plans to employ another 1,500, as an example.

by a mob during a stamped rally of presidential candidate Paul
Ssemogerere at Makerere University.
</P>
<P>
An official statement issued here today by the DP said that

erupted when a man carrying a Yoweri Museveni poster was pounced
on by the mob.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Send Foodstuff, Medical Aid to Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government will
dispatch a high-ranking delegation with foodstuffs and medical aid
to Lebanon, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the decision
was made at a cabinet meeting presided over by President
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet reviewed the latest developments at home and
abroad, especially the ongoing Israeli attacks on the residential
areas of Lebanon, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the cabinet asked the country's relief
organization, particularly the Red Crescent Society, to take
necessary steps to rush foodstuffs and medical aid to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
It also asked the Foreign Ministry to dispatch a delegation to
Beirut to convey to the Lebanese government and people messages
of sympathy from the Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said that in view of
the failure of Washington and Tel Aviv at the so-called
anti-terrorist summit in Sharm al-Sheikh and the subsequent
postponing of the Brussels meeting, the Israeli attack on Lebanon
was not unexpected and that the Islamic Resistance and the
Hezbollah in Lebanon were prepared for it.
</P>
<P>
He said the Israeli aggression against Lebanon should serve as
a lesson for "naive and simple-minded governments of the real
transgressive nature of the Zionist regime," and should make
them realize that a state "founded on usurpation, occupation and
terrorism will be on no account forego its oppressive policies
especially when its diplomatic moves have floundered, as is
evident from the attack on Lebanon and its disregard for any
international borders."
</P>
<P>
In his address to ambassadors and heads of missions in
Iran, Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi called on
international forums to categorically denounce Israel's state
terrorism in Lebanon, and to enforce U.N. Resolution 425, which
stipulates an unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from the
occupied strip of South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iranian First Vice-President Hassan Habibi called
for strengthening the armed forces to foil the efforts of the
enemies of the Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a group of armed forces commanders on the
occasion of the first scientific and research festival, he
stressed that Iran's military capability is not meant against any
regional state, and the concern expressed by certain neighboring
states in this regard is the result of misleading attempts by
aliens and outsiders.

<HEADLINE> Establishment of Asian Ombudsman Association Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Chief of the
Ombudsman Department Abdul Shakurul Salam today urged the creation
of an Asian Ombudsman Association for fighting against corruption
more effectively.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the inaugural ceremony of the First Asian Ombudsman
Conference held in Islamabad, Salam said, "At international level,
there is an International Ombudsman Institute in which 75
countries are represented."
</P>
<P>
However, the international gathering of ombudsmen is only at
four years' interval because of preparation and expense, he said.
</P>
<P>
"So, various regions have established Regional Ombudsman
Associations, like the North American Ombudsman Association, the
European Ombudsman Association, the Australasia Pacific Ombudsman
Association, and etc.," he added.
</P>
<P>
Last year, an Ombudsman conference of African States was held
in Sudan with a view to forming an association, he said, adding
that "Asia alone is without such an association."
</P>
<P>
Although different countries have different cultures, languages
and legal systems, many Asian countries have rich experiences in
coping with corruption, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Now, we are gathering here to exchange information, to learn
from each other and see what we can do for each other so that in
our own countries, we can serve our people better," he added.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference was attended by more than 40 delegates
from 17 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Chairman of Senate
Wasim Sajjad also attended the opening ceremony of the conference.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A massive rodent-control
campaign has gotten underway in this capital of northeast China's
Liaoning Province - with an offer of one yuan for every mouse
caught.
</P>
<P>
The local patriotic health-care council came up with the
one-yuan offer (one US dollar is 8.3 yuan) for local citizens who
do their duty and catch a mouse to arouse interest in eradicating
the mice to make life a lot healthier in the city.
</P>
<P>
Mice cause great losses for the city and the incidents of
mouse-related diseases have increased by 17 percent over last
year, posing a threat to the lives and health of the local people.
</P>
<P>
The number of mice caught will be accounted for by their tails.
</P>
<P>
In January, the pilot reform city of Shenzhen in south China's
Guangdong Province launched a similar campaign, offering the
locals five yuan for each mouse.
</P>
<P>
The anti-mice activities are running concurrently with the
"Year of the Mouse", 1996, on the traditional Chinese calendar.

<HEADLINE> Mecca Trip for Greater Numbers of Shaanxi Muslims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Eight Chinese Muslims, who regard a
pilgrimage to Mecca as the high point in their lives, were able to
make the journey on April 8, on behalf of their brethren in the
capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Sha Pengcheng, one of the eight who is president of Xi'an's
Sanbao Shuangxi Group, said, "I have always looked forward to a
pilgrimage to Mecca, but couldn't make it because I didn't have
enough money."
</P>
<P>
He went on to say, "Governments at all levels now help members
of ethnic minority groups build businesses, and we have benefitted
from the government's reform and opening-up policy. Our living
standard has risen substantially and my long-cherished wish has
come true today."
</P>
<P>
Sha has turned a small beef canning operation into a major
enterprise group producing food for both the domestic and foreign
market.
</P>
<P>
He is a winner of the Fourth International Science and Peace
Week Prize and has been chosen as an outstanding factory director
from ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
According to Sha, some Western countries are making
irresponsible and indiscreet remarks about China, criticizing
human rights conditions and the absence of religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
"We ethnic minorities living in China are most capable of
judging whether Chinese enjoy human rights and religious freedom,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Governments at various levels have always respected our
freedom of religious beliefs, and we are grateful to the local
government for assisting us in making our pilgrimage," he noted.
</P>
<P>
During the April trip, a total of 82 Muslims in Shaanxi made
the voyage to Mecca. Over the past 40 years, 2,000 Shaanxi Muslims
have made the pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi has a total of 165,000 people who are members of ethnic
minorities. Of those, 140,000 are Hui people, the Muslim minority.
</P>
<P>
Ma Xiping, a provincial official with the Ethnic and Religious
Affairs Commission, said that the provincial government has done
its best in assisting ethnic minority people in economic, cultural
and social development.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past four years, my commission and other provincial
government departments have spent ten million yuan on 38 projects
in ethnic minority areas," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
These involve the construction of facilities for transport,
telecommunications, medical care, water supplies, culture, and
education.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-three primary schools and 19 kindergartens serving
ethnic minority children exclusively have been set up in Shaanxi,
Sha said, explaining that classes specially designed for these
children have been set up in six middle schools.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Revise Import-export Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is to revise its
import-export regulations to streamline red-tape procedures and
boost foreign trade, the English daily "Vietnam News" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the revision was contained in a new draft law
of commerce to be submitted to the National Assembly later this
year.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Trade Minister Le Van Triet as saying that
Vietnam is seeking an export turnover of 45 billion U.S. dollars
under the next five-year plan ending year 2000, or an increase of
almost 280 percent over the 16 billion dollars posted during the
last five-year plan.
</P>
<P>
For exports to reach 17-20 billion dollars by 2000, the growth
rate will have to hit almost 30 percent, Triet said.
</P>
<P>
To meet these goals, the trade ministry has put forward several
proposals for restructuring the economy, including industrializing
agriculture, forestry and fisheries to improve production quality
and quantity, the minister said..
</P>
<P>
"Export of commodities such as rice, coffee and cashews will be
encouraged in the form of processed goods rather than raw
materials to add their value," Triet said. "This will require
upgrading, processing and service industries to store, preserve
and package products according to international standards."
</P>
<P>
But the minister said the government intends to maintain its
ban on exports of raw timber, logs, cut wood, and raw and
semi-processed rattan, and will seek to reduce exports of crude
minerals including crude oil and unprocessed natural gas.
</P>
<P>
As a party to the Free Trade Area (AFTA) of the Association of
South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), Vietnam will reduce tariffs on
import items for other AFTA member countries.
</P>
<P>
But Triet said the reductions will have little effect on the
country's budget revenues as 57 percent of the 857 items slated
for reductions are currently subject to low tariffs of zero to
five percent, while only about 17 to 21 percent are subject to
tariffs of 20 percent and above.

<P>
The National Front-left forces is an alliance consisting of
Janata Dal, Janata Party, the Communist Party of India (CPI), the
Communist Party of India (M), Samajwadi (socialist) Party, etc.
Their unified manifesto has not been released so far due to their
different ideologies and policies.
</P>
<P>
In its own manifesto released on April 10, the Samajwadi Party
held that the much-touted liberation policy of the Narasimha Rao
government was responsible for the spurt in corruption and
unemployment in the country.
</P>
<P>
The CPI in its own manifesto released on March 27 appealed to
voters to bring the alliance of left, democratic and secular
forces to power and defeat the Congress and the BJP. The CPI
manifesto said that left and secular forces acting together could
lead the people to a new order capable of defending country's
economic and political independence based on social justice for
all.
</P>
<P>
The CPI was opposed to defense link-up with the US and joint
naval and other forms of military exercises, saying armed
intervention or economic blockade and blackmail by imperialist
powers, mainly the US, against socialist and other developing
countries must be firmly opposed.
</P>
<P>
The party also stressed the need for reinvigoration of the
Non-Aligned Movement.
</P>
<P>
As the third force is comparatively weak, the main fight will
take place between the Congress and the BJP in the forthcoming
elections with none of them being in a position to win a clear
majority.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Funds for Tibet's Processing Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Foreign capital in Tibet is
expected to grow annually at a rate of 15 percent during the Ninth
Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), with contractual funds expected to
reach 14 million U.S.dollars each year by 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to the autonomous region's department in charge of
foreign trade and economic co-operation, it plans to increase
utilization of foreign funds, and bring in state-of-the-art
technology and advanced managerial skills, to develop its
processing industry.
</P>
<P>
The annual increase in Tibet's processing trade, which accounts
for 10 percent of its total foreign trade volume presently, is
expected to reach 40 percent by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The processing trade will replace general trade in playing a
key role in Tibet's foreign trade, a major adjustment in the
autonomous region's overseas trade structure.
</P>
<P>
Tibet's rich resources are useful to the development of
large-scale processing industry and its geographical position
makes it easy to develop foreign trade, so processing is thought
to be a promising industry in the near future by some economists.

The local authority has also tightened controls on
tranquilizers and is prohibiting the sale of these drugs to
persons below the age of 18, and those violating the rule will be
severely punished.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Prime Minister Condemns Israeli Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al
Hariri today condemned strongly the Israeli air and artillery
attacks in southern Lebanon and Beirut and demanded that Israeli
troops withdraw from Lebanese territory.
</P>
<P>
In an interview on French television this evening, Hariri said
it was unreasonable for Israel to take the military action on the
excuse of retaliating against Hizbollah guerrillas based in
southern Lebanon where Israeli troops still occupy a security
zone.
</P>
<P>
He said Israel had occupied the area since 1978 but failed to
solve the security problem there. The issue could be resolved
only by political, not military, means, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said Israeli troops should leave and let Lebanon take
responsibility for guaranteeing the security of the south and
peaceful coexistence among its inhabitants, with the help of the
United Nations and France.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese prime minister, who arrived here on Sunday
afternoon, held talks with French President Jacques Chirac Sunday
evening.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Chirac appealed to all sides to exercise
restraint and to agree a ceasefire as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, a French government spokesman announced that
Foreign Minister Herve de Charettee will go to the Middle East to
mediate in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Chirac discussed the Lebanese situation with U.S. President
Bill Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres on the
telephone on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Before his arrival in Paris, Hariri met with Syrian President
Hafez al Assad in Damascus on Saturday and Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak in Cairo on Sunday morning to discuss the Lebanese
situation.
</P>
<P>
At least 21 people have been killed and 55 injured in Lebanon
since Thursday when Israeli helicopters began bombarding Beirut
and southern Lebanon in retaliation against Hizbollah rocket
attacks into northern Israel.

two countries.
</P>
<P>

to China's status as a big power and wishes to strengthen the two
countries' mutual support and cooperation in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Macedonia will continue to pursue one-China
policy and wishes an early unification of China.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with reporters after the meeting, Gligorov said
it is still necessary for Macedonia and China to improve their
mutual understandings of each other.
</P>
<P>
"It is more easier to find common stand with mutual
understanding and friendship, so that the two countries can expand
their cooperation in economy, culture and other areas," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Macedonia wishes to maintain a friendly ties with
its neighbors and is ready to work for regional stability.
</P>
<P>
Since independence, Macedonia has established diplomatic
relations with all its neighbors and the other independent former
Yugoslav republics.
</P>
<P>
On the Bosnian issue, the president said though the war in the
region is stopped for the moment, but is not ended, the region is
still under the threat of war.
</P>
<P>
"I wish Bosnia-Herzegovina will get a new life as a sovereign
state," he said.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day visit, Qian also met with Macedonian
Parliament Speaker Tito Perkovski on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> 45 Thai Jewelry Firms to Take Part in Basel Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 15 (Xinhua) -- As many as 45 Thai gems and
jewelry companies have gained entry to the Basel Fair,
Switzerland, which opens next week.
</P>
<P>
Last year, only 25 gems and jewelry firms were admitted to the
fair, which is almost universally accepted as the most effective
worldwide sales event in the gems and jewelry industry.
</P>
<P>
This year's show has gained added significance, with Thai
jewelry exports to Europe growing by very substantial margins.
</P>
<P>
The expansion has been particularly rapid in Switzerland, with
the growth rate of Thai exports currently running at about 50
percent a year.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland has emerged as the fourth-largest consumer market
for Thai jewelry.
</P>
<P>
For more than a decade, controversy has marred Thai
participation in the Basel Fair, formally known as the World
Watch, Clock and Jewelry Fair. The main objection was the Swiss
insistence that Thailand enforce stricter copyright protection
measures and reduce import duties on watches and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
Following actions which the Thai government took on both of
these issues, the Basel Fair organizers finally relented and
agreed to allow limited Thai participation last year.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Trade with Neighboring Countries Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's overall trade with its
neighboring countries grew markedly last year, while its border
trade with these countries fell significantly.
</P>
<P>
According to the Customs Department of the Commerce Ministry,
Thailand' trade with Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos and Malaysia totaled
154.7 billion baht (6.2 billion U.S. dollars) in value last year,
up 25.8 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Of the four countries, Thailand saw a trade deficit only with
Malaysia, 41 billion baht (1.6 billion dollars) out of the two-way
trade worth 118 billion baht (4.7 billion dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Growing air and sea routes contributed to the trade increase.
</P>
<P>
However, Thailand's border trade with these countries fell
significantly to 38.8 billion baht (1.5 billion dollars) last year
from 66.3 billion baht (2.6 billion dollars) in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Thailand this year is seeking new ways, including
establishments of trade offices or duty-free shops near border
checkpoints, to promote Thailand's border trade with its
neighboring countries.

BANGKOK, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) plans to
invite some 700 business people from the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) to visit Europe as part of an exchange
program.
</P>
<P>
The invitation would be a follow-up on the Asia-Europe Meeting
(ASEM) held in early March in Bangkok. Business people will be
selected from small and medium-sized enterprises to participate in
the program.
</P>
<P>
The EU also proposed sending 300 European business people to
ASEAN countries and roundtable sessions will be organized to
exchange ideas and opinions and address obstacles to trade between
the two regions, according to Chirayuth Vasuat, secretary general
of Thailand's Board of Trade.
</P>
<P>
Chirayuth said the EU is worried by low European investment in
the fast-growing economies of the ASEAN, where violations of
intellectual property rights and other protectionist measures are
cited as obstacles.
</P>
<P>
After the Asian-Europe Meeting (ASEM), the ASEAN and the EU
have discussed setting up of an ASEM Business Council.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Government Troops Keep Advancing in Western  Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Afghan government troops have
entered the southwestern part of the Taliban-held province of
Herat, local press reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Some Afghan Defense officials were quoted as saying Sunday that
their advancing troops had seized kilometers of grounds from the
Taliban Militia in Herat province.
</P>
<P>
The government forces launched an offensive against Taliban in
western Afghanistan last Friday, in a bid to retake Herat city,
capital of Herat province and a strategic point.
</P>
<P>
Herat had been in the hand of pro-government forces until last
September when the Taliban Militia swept the western part of the
country and took it over.
</P>
<P>
Afghan Defense officials said that the government troops
marched into the eastern part of Herat province two days before.
</P>
<P>
"In the face of intense resistance from Taliban, our troops
have been moving forward steadily in the province," they said.
</P>
<P>
"We have now moved over the mountains, dividing Herat and its
neighboring province of Ghor," they added.
</P>
<P>
Observers predicted earlier this year that another showdown
between Afghan government troops and the Taliban Militia would
take place around Kabul or Herat when the winter was over.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan opposition leaders including Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and
Rashid Dostum also made the same estimations in February when they
attended a crucial meeting in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Afghan Defense officials refused to confirm if the
fighting in Herat province was part of a large offensive.

BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The total amount of individual
income tax was 175 million yuan in the first quarter of this year,

<P>
The local tax bureau said that March revenues were up 10

on taxation.

<HEADLINE> Li's Visit Hailed as New Chapter of Sino-French Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng's visit
to France has both improved the trade and economic cooperation
between China and France and upgraded to a new level the relations
between China and Europe.
</P>
<P>
This came in an editorial carried in today's People's Daily,
the leading Chinese national newspaper.
</P>
<P>
During his five-day official visit which aroused wide concerns
in the world, Premier Li Peng held talks with French President
Jacques Chirac, Prime Minister Alain Juppe and business and
industrial executives.
</P>
<P>
The editorial said that Li's visit to France has demonstrated
China's aspiration to safeguard world peace and boost common
development worldwide.
</P>
<P>
As a developing country with a significant potential as an
important economic and trade partner, China is able to make
contribution to world peace and development as well as breathe a
new life into the global economy through its growing economic
cooperation with the outside world, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier's visit demonstrated that China attaches
great importance to developing relations with the European Union
nations.
</P>
<P>
The visit not only cemented the rapprochement between China and
France, but also materialized the theme of the Euro-Asia Summit,
which was held in Bangkok in the end of February, of "establishing
a 21st-century-oriented partnership between Asia and Europe".
</P>
<P>
Based on the four principles for the promotion of Sino-European
relations, which were put forward by Chinese President Jiang Zemin
during his state visit to France in 1994, the Chinese premier also
set out four proposals aimed at improving Sino-French relations.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng noted that bilateral relations should be further
developed by enhancing mutual trust and looking into the future so
as to set up a lasting and stable political relationship; by
supplementing each other on the basis of equality and mutual
benefit so as to bring into full play the economic advantage and
potential of the two countries; by expanding results born out of
cooperation so as to deepen mutual understanding through cultural,
educational, scientific and technological exchanges; and by
coordinating standpoints in dealing with international affairs so
as to contribute toward safeguarding world peace.
</P>
<P>
The editorial said that these principles and proposals were
widely agreed upon in the French political and economic circles.
</P>
<P>
It went on to say that China and France are influential
countries in the world and both pursue independent foreign
policies. As permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, the
two countries are duty-bound to safeguard world peace and maintain
stability.
</P>
<P>
Both China and France have their own splendid cultures and have
made great contribution to human civilization and progress. Both
countries cherish a history of friendly exchanges and contacts. On
the basis of the joint communique signed on January 12, 1994, the
Sino-French relations started to grow rapidly after overcoming
some obstacles following a period of twists and turns.
</P>
<P>
China and France share identical or similar views in
international affairs and it is of great importance for both to
maintain constant consultations on major international
issues. Both countries have their own strength and advantages in
economic development. They can learn from and supplement each
other in that respect, said the editorial which predicted that
Sino-French cooperation will enjoy a robust development so long as
the two nations stick to the principle of mutual respect and
mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
A well-established cooperation between China and France will
not only benefit the two peoples, but will turn out to be
conducive to the creation of a new partnership between Asia and
Europe as well as to the establishment of a just and fair world
order of politics and economy, it said.
</P>
<P>
The world is undergoing profound changes and it should not be
dominated by any single power, it said. The Chinese government is
ready, together with France and other nations in the world, to
speed up the process of multi-polarization and continue to make
unremitting efforts to promote world peace and development, the
editorial concluded.

<HEADLINE> Thai Textile Industry Sees Threat Under AFTA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's textile and garment
industry may be at risk from cheaper products under the ASEAN Free
Trade Area (AFTA)'s fast-track traffic reduction scheme, according
to the Thai Garment Manufacturers Association.
</P>
<P>
Cheaper ASEAN textiles and garments, especially from Indonesia,
might pour into Thailand as import tariffs on these products are
scheduled to be lowered to 5 percent by 2000 under the AFTA
scheme, said Viroj Amatakulchai, president of the association.
</P>
<P>
Thai textile and garment imports from other ASEAN countries are
not very large currently because of the 45 percent tariff rate,
Viroj said, noting the imports will be rising in the next three or
four years owing to the lowering tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted that Thailand could prevent large-scale imports
by applying rules of origin regulations, which require that at
least 40 percent of the raw materials of those products eligible
under the scheme must be made in the member countries of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN have agreed that two methods can be used to define a
ASEAN textile and garment product -- the 40 percent content
method, and the substantial transformation method which defines
products according to the amount of raw materials in them that
have been processed into other products with different customs
codes.
</P>
<P>
However, Viroj said that Thailand hoped all exporters to select
the substantial transformation method because it is easier to
prove that products have actually undergone some manufacturing
processes in the ASEAN.

<HEADLINE> State to Grant One billion Yuan for Relic Salvage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The government has vowed to
devote more attention and money to salvage and protect china's
historical relics during the Ninth Five Year Plan (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
The State Council has ordered that at least 25 million yuan
(three million US dollars) be spent per year for the next five
years on this operation, said Fu Qingyuan, a leading official from
the State Bureau of Cultural Relics.
</P>
<P>
Funds from the Ministry of Finance and local governments are
also being requisitioned to implement the preservation plan, Fu
said.
</P>
<P>
There are some 350,000 historical sites scattered across the
country, including ancient buildings, tombs, grottoes and stone
inscriptions.
</P>
<P>
Since most of these relics are made of wool and silk, they are
vulnerable to natural and accidental damage and deterioration.
</P>
<P>
A group of 500 historical sites will be put under State-level
protection this year, doubling the existing number and increasing
the need for restoration funds.
</P>
<P>
The bureau has mapped out plans to excavate and oversee large
historical sites which have long been regarded as the hardest
cultural relics to conserve.
</P>
<P>
The security system of some major museums will be strengthened
to guarantee sufficient protection for their collections.
</P>
<P>
There are reportedly 11.57 million relics held in Chinese
museums.
</P>
<P>
In the last five years, China has already spent over 595
million yuan (72 million US dollars) to subsidize 1,162 salvage,
protection and restoration projects.
</P>
<P>
The Potala Palace in Lhasa, Tibet, the Dunhuang Grottoes in
Gansu Province, the Yungang Stone Carvings of Shanxi Province, and
several other large historical sites have been well preserved.
</P>
<P>
However, Fu said, due to a rapid rise in construction costs,
some 60 percent of the 1,162 projects were not completed by
December 1995, as originally scheduled.

BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 wild ducks have
prolonged their visit to a new man-made lake in Yanqing County in
northeast Beijing.
</P>
<P>
According to today's "Beijing Daily", the wild ducks have been
experiencing a life of harmony with the 60,000 residents in the
county seat since winter.
</P>
<P>
The 500-mu (about 33 hectares) Lotus Lake, was completed last
year.
</P>
<P>
Experts say it is uncommon for so many wild ducks to settle
down near the capital, and is because of improved natural
surroundings.
</P>
<P>
County officials say they will begin a second phase of
construction on the lake this year, for another 500 mu.

<HEADLINE> Water and Electricity Rate Hikes in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital authorities
have decided to increase the price of water and electricity for
its residents this month, and has gotten approval from the State
Council.
</P>
<P>
According to today's "Beijing Daily", the price of water has
been raised to 0.5 yuan / ton and that of electricity 0.313 / kwh
from 0.3 yuan and 0.248 yuan, respectively. One US dollar equals
8.3 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The move was prompted by the fact that local prices for the two
were considered too low for a long time, and were not conducive
either to protecting natural resources, or to developing local
water and power facilities.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, which is in north China, is dry and has a small amount
of yearly rainfall, and underground supplies of water have been
decreasing annually.
</P>
<P>
To meet residents' increasing needs for water, the city has
invested in a new water plant. The present cost of one ton of
water, one yuan, has resulted in great losses for the nine local
water plants.
</P>
<P>
Electricity in Beijing is supplied by coal-fired plants and the
price of coal has risen by 65 percent, also causing losses in the
local power plants.
</P>
<P>
Water and electricity are both subsidized by the local
government.

</P>
<P>
Of the total, 186 are Sino-foreign joint ventures, and 105 are
exclusively foreign-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Multinational firms from the United States, Holland, Germany,
France, and Japan set up 37 enterprises in Beijing during the
first three months of 1996, 27 of them having an investment
of more than 10 million US dollars each.
</P>
<P>
Economic experts attribute the increase of overseas investment
in Beijing to the local upswing in infrastructure, and the second
strongest comprehensive economic strength in China after Shanghai,
as well as rapid scientific and technological development.
</P>
<P>
The city also has a broad market for consumer goods, with
local total turnover from retail trade last year rising 23.7
percent over the previous year to exceed 84 billion yuan.

investment from 47.12 billion Japanese Yen to 72.18 billion
Japanese Yen, in a bid to add 800,000 color kinescopes and three
million display tubes annually.
</P>
<P>
There are 270 renowned multinational firms who have set up 344
enterprises in Beijing, with contractual overseas investment
reaching nearly 2.9 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The city now has a total of more than 12,070 foreign-funded
enterprises, attracting 18.2 billion US dollars in overseas

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin is restoring its status
as north China's commercial center following a series of
successful trade fairs.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,200 stands at a spring commodities fair which has
just ended were fully booked, forcing organizers to put up
temporary stands outside the exhibition hall.
</P>
<P>
The four-day fair drew 100,000 business people from China and
seven foreign countries and regions. Deals worth about 700 million
yuan (84.33 million US dollars) were clinched during the event.
</P>
<P>
Many overseas businesses flocked to the fair which they
considered a bridge leading to markets in north China. One Taiwan
enterprise rented eight stands at the fair.
</P>
<P>
An export commodity fair and a tourism fair held earlier were
equally fruitful.
</P>
<P>
The export fair, jointly staged by the northwest and north
regions of China, led to contracts worth 610 million US dollars,
double the figure of the previous event, while the tourism fair
clinched deals involving journeys by over 500,000 tourists.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin, which is the largest sea port in north China, is
striving to become a center of exchange of personnel, information,
materials and funds, by the end of this century, said Zhang
Haosheng, vice mayor of Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
In modern history, the city served as a commercial center in
north China, similar to Shanghai's role in south China.
</P>
<P>
The city has established a dozen national markets and eight
regional markets of production materials, including iron and steel,
coal, chemical materials, and second-hand motor vehicles.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today began an eight-day round-the-world visit to show his
capability and skills in foreign affairs and promote U.S. security
relations with its allies in northeastern Asia.
</P>
<P>
Leaving Washington late this evening, Clinton will stop briefly
in South Korea before a three-day state visit to Japan, the first
of its kind since former U.S. President George Bush visited the
country in January 1992.
</P>
<P>
Clinton then will fly to Russia for a summit of Russia and
seven leading industrialized nations on international nuclear
safety and security.
</P>
<P>
"The president will confront some of the oldest and newest
challenges to the security of our nation, from the last unresolved
problem of the Cold War...to one of the most urgent new threats we
face -- nuclear smuggling," U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher told reporters today.
</P>
<P>
White House and State Department officials have said security
problems, not trade disputes, are expected to lead Clinton's
agenda on his visit.

Christopher said that Clinton has made strong headway on
opening markets for U.S. products in Japan.

<P>
"It's a good time to emphasize the security and political
aspects of our relationship, to show that all the legs of the
stool are of great importance," he said.

<HEADLINE> 2 UK Tory MPs Poised to Defect to Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Britain's opposition Labor leader
Tony Blair has appealed to the demoralized Tory members of
parliament to join his party and force the Conservative Prime
Minister John Major to call for an early general election.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Blair said his Labor
party was now the natural home for Tories on the left wing of
their party.
</P>
<P>
He said that Labor as a center party also embraced many
traditional Tory values. "Today, the new Labour is the party that
can unite ambition with compassion; aspiration with a desire to
live in a decent society," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times also revealed that two more Tory MPs have held
secret talks with Labor about defecting.
</P>
<P>
The two unnamed Tory MPs told senior figures in Labor's shadow
cabinet that they were deeply worried about the government's shift
to right-wing Eurosceptic policies.
</P>
<P>
Since last October, two Tory MPs have crossed the floor of the
House of Commons, one to Labor and another to the Liberal
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
One more defection would wipe out Major's majority in the
parliament, increasing the prospect of the Tories losing a vote of
confidence, which would trigger an immediate general election.
</P>
<P>
Left-wing Tories did not discount the possibility of further
defections Saturday night. They plan to cite last week's
by-election defeat in as evidence that Major should abandon his
rightward shift and fight Labor for the center ground.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted by the Sunday Times among the
Tory backbenchers, the Tory MPs are deeply demoralized.
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of Tory MPs believe their party will not win the
next general election, which is scheduled for May 1997, and more
than one in three predict Blair will be the next prime minister.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- As Britain's ruling Tory party and
the opposition Labor are brewing their manifestoes for the next
general election, at least one pro-Conservative newspaper may
switch allegiance to the opposition Labor, a British press magnate
hinted today.
</P>
<P>
Associated Newspapers proprietor Lord Rothermere told the BBC
that some of his newspapers might offer their sympathy for Labor
leader Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Newspapers Group includes the Daily Mail, Mail
on Sunday and London Evening Standard, which traditionally back
the Conservatives.
</P>
<P>
The group's chairman Sir David English has also said that the
group would consider endorsing Labor.
