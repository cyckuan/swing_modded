<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Bans Demonstrations during Pilgrimage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Minister of Pilgrimage
Mahmoud Bin Mohammed Safar affirmed today in Riyadh that Saudi
Arabia would not allow demonstrations during this Year's
pilgrimage, the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
"The Saudi government is the custodian of guests of his
almighty and this mission requires safeguarding their safety and
protecting them against any thing that might cause evil or
divisions," Safar said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the Saudi authorities banned propaganda
activities during the services.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged pilgrims to be aware of regulations
ahead of their arrival at the holy sites, saying "there will
be no excuse for any person who may behave incorrectly."
</P>
<P>
The Saudi authorities declared last month that pilgrims would
not be allowed to hold political gatherings during the Hajj.
</P>
<P>
Riyadh's move was seen as a response to statements by Iranian
President Hashemi Rafsanjani that the Iranian pilgrims planned to
hold political gatherings during the pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
During several previous pilgrimages, Saudi security forces
clashed with Iranian pilgrims who staged political
demonstrations.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Housing Starts Drop Sharply in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Housing starts in U.S. slipped
3.9 percent in March, the steepest drop in a year, according to a
report by the U.S. Commerce Department today.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said that construction of new homes and
apartments totaled 1.45 million at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate, the fifth straight month above a 1.4 million rate.
</P>
<P>
The drop was the biggest since a 6.17 percent plunge in March
1995.
</P>
<P>
The department also revised last month's total to 1.51 million
from initially estimated 1.49 million. The February rate was the
highest compared with 1.51 million in May 1994. Analysts said the
3.6 percent jump reflected builders' rush to pour foundations
before rising rates priced buyers out of the market.
</P>
<P>
But many analysts believe the housing market has peaked now
that financing has grown more expensive.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 7.68 percent in
March, up from 7.17 percent in February and 7.03 percent in
January 1996. They have continued to climb and topped 8.05 percent
last week, highest since 8.27 percent in May 1995.
</P>
<P>
Applications for building permits, often a barometer for future
activity, were virtually unchanged in March, inching up just 0.1
percent to a 1.41 million annual rate.
</P>
<P>
Interest-sensitive single-family starts, about 80 percent of
residential building activity, fell 1.4 percent to a 1.16 million
rate from 1.18 million in February.
</P>
<P>
Activity was mixed regionally in the country, rising in the
Northeast and Midwest and falling in the South and West.
</P>
<P>
Housing starts shot up 10.2 percent in the Northeast and 3.5
percent in the Midwest. But they sank 16.1 percent in the West,
the biggest drop after falling 20.7 percent in March 1995 and were
down 2.3 percent in the South.

<HEADLINE> UK Unemployment Falls in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment in Britain fell
unexpectedly in March and reached the lowest level for nearly five
years, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said today.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the ONS show that the number of people out
of work fell by 25,700 to a seasonally adjusted 2,186,600 last
month.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate declined to 7.8 percent of the whole
workforce from 7.9 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
It follows a surprise rise in February. However, officials
cautioned the March figure could have been exaggerated because it
covered a five-week period.
</P>
<P>
The ONS said that the underlying trend appeared to indicate a
monthly fall of 10,000.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that the strength of the figures suggested
there might be little scope for further cuts in British interest
rates, which had been reduced three times recently to their
current six percent level.

<HEADLINE> Hospital Fees Rise In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Fees at the government and local
council hospitals and clinics will be increased by 40 to 100
percent with effect from May 1.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwen Health Minister Timothy Stamps said here today that
rural people would continue to receive free health services.
</P>
<P>
People earning less than 400 Zimbabwe Dollars (44 U.S.
Dollars) a month would still receive free treatment provided they
go through the referral system, he added.
</P>
<P>
The increase would enable the cash-strapped health
institutions to provide the required basic health services,
according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
"The ministry has been having financial problems and we
received an additional 23.33 million U.S. Dollars from the
government and this is not enough to sustain our services," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
"The cabinet then agreed that we should take into account the
devaluation of the Zimbabwe Dollar, therefore there will be an
increase in fees at all health institutions, except rural health
centres and hospitals, with effect from May 1," he explained.

MANILA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government decided
today to suspend the export of captive-bred monkeys suspected to
be carrying the Ebola virus following reports that the virus found
in the United States was traced to the animals imported from the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
A special task force consisting of experts from the departments
of health and the environment and natural resources has started
conducting tests on monkeys to find out if they are carriers of
the Ebola virus.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos ordered an investigation into the case
and the findings will be made public.
</P>
<P>
US health officials traced the Ebola virus to monkeys that came
from the Philippines. The Ebola-carrier monkeys are kept at
private breeding facilities in Alice, Texas, according to local
reports.
</P>
<P>
But it is reported that the Ebola virus is not the same as the
deadly Ebola virus from Zaire that was blamed for the hundreds of
death in Central Africa last year.

<HEADLINE> Libya Again Denies US Allegation on Nuclear Weapon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TRIPOLI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Libya today again denied
U.S. allegations that Libya is building a nuclear weapon plant,
saying that the United States has no right to follow what other
countries are doing.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here to a group of foreign
journalists based in Tunis and Cairo, Libyan leader Muammar
Gaddafi said what has been alleged by the U.S. as the nuclear
weapon plant is the second phase of a "man-made river project."
</P>
<P>
Pointing to a map, he said that a South Korean company is
helping in the project which is reportedly designed to carry
underground water in the desert to the residents living in the
northern coasts.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has said that Libya is building a chemical weapon
plant into a mountain at Tarhunah, some 65 kilometers southeast of
Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi told reporters that Libya is making a tunnel in the
mountain so that water can pass through the tunnel and be carried
to Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
"This is what America is talking about now," he said, accusing
the United States of fabrication.
</P>
<P>
He added that he is not obliged to tell the United States what
Libya is doing and the United States has no right to use force
against Libya.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has threatened to use force to stop what is called a
"nuclear weapon plant" from being completed.
</P>
<P>
"Who give the right to America to follow what other countries
are doing?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United States should attack Israel because the
Jewish state has nuclear and chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi reiterated that Libya was not involved in the 1988
bombing of an American passenger plane over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
He said that even "the United States has been sure and has said
that Libya has nothing to do with Lockerbie."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions on Libya, which
include an air embargo, a ban on the sale or transfer of weapons
and a downgrading of diplomatic relations, in April 1992 after
Libya refused to surrender two suspects in the bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi, who has been in power since 1969, accused the United
States of exercising terrorism against Libya.
</P>
<P>
"If we talk about Lockerbie, we should talk about the American
air strike on Libya in 1986," he said.
</P>
<P>
In April 1986, U.S. military aircraft bombed military
installations, airports, government buildings and suspected
terrorist training camps and communication centers in the Libyan
cities of Tripoli and Benghazi.
</P>
<P>
The attacks killed over 100 people, including many civilians.
</P>
<P>
Asked on the future relations between Libya and Israel, he said
that "Israel never wants peace. Peace will kill them."
</P>
<P>
He blamed the peacemakers summit held on March 13 in Egypt,
saying that the current Israeli attacks on Lebanon were just one
of the results of the summit.

HARARE, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe today described the behaviour of some University of
Zimbabwe students as "disgraceful" and "unbecoming".
</P>
<P>
The president was reacting to the recent student riot on the
occasion of marking Zimbabwe's 16th independence anniversary at
the city sports centre.
</P>
<P>
"It now appears going to the University of Zimbabwe is like
going to an institution of higher indiscipline," Mugabe told 4000
students present at the independence marking function.
</P>
<P>
He said if the recent incident was a reflection of the
standard of discipline in universities, the system of education
needed to be improved upon or revamped altogether.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 students of University of Zimbabwe in Harare went on
rampage on Monday night and damaged property worth thousands of
dollars in protest against high price and poor quality food.

<P>
LONDON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Lebanese Prime Minister
Rafik al-Hariri said today that he favors a French peace plan to
end the Israeli-Hizbollah armed clashes.
</P>
<P>
Hariri said in a BBC radio interview that he preferred the
French proposal to the version put forward by the United States.
</P>
<P>
"There are elements more appealling in the French proposal," he
said, adding he would not be prepared to sign up to the American
plan.
</P>
<P>
The French plan, proposed by French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette, included a reference to a UN resolution for Israel to
pull out of southern Lebanon while the American version did not,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after his meeting with British
Prime Minister John Major this afternoon, Hariri said that Major
agreed that military action must stop in the area and they also
discussed a "new initiative" to end the violence.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is to stop the violence, to stop the
civilian killing and the destroying of the infrastructure of
Lebanon," Hariri said.
</P>
<P>
He also made it clear that the Lebanese government is "able to
disarm Hizbollah but it is not reasonable to do this while Israel
occupies our country".

<P>
As a result, by 1993 nearly 14 million people were living in
poverty, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, in 1979 only five million people, equivalent to
nine percent of the population, were in similar straits.
</P>
<P>
In its conclusion, the report calls for a combination of strong
employment rights, more flexible benefits, and a more progressive
tax structure to help reverse the trend.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Emergency Meeting Held in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The emergency meeting of the Arab
League Council of Ministers began its works in Cairo today at
foreign ministers' level to examine the situation in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The emergency meeting will focus on the Israeli aggressions
against south Lebanon and Beirut's southern suburbs, and will
discuss a report by Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz as well
as a Lebanese draft resolution on implementing U.N. Security
Council resolution 425 which stipulates the withdrawal of Israel
from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the inaugural session, Arab League Secretary
General Esmat Abdul-Meguid said that the expansion of Israeli
military operations in Lebanon, including the attacks on vital
utilities, the killing and injuring of numerous innocent
civilians, and the displacing of some half a million Lebanese
citizens, affirms that Israel has premeditated designs aimed at
emptying the southern part of Lebanon of its inhabitants and
preventing the return of normal life to that region, besides the
grave damages done to the Lebanese infrastructure at a time when
Lebanon is endeavoring to consolidate its economy after 15 years
of civil war.
</P>
<P>
Meguid added that Lebanon's demands for ceasefire and total
Israeli withdrawal up to the Lebanese-Israeli international
boundaries so that it may extend the control of its territory,
were legitimate ones and efforts should be made to effect them.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League chief called upon the U.N. Security Council and
the co-sponsors of the peace conference, the U.S. and Russia, to
shoulder their international responsibility of ending the Israeli
aggressions on Lebanon, deterring the continued Israeli violations
against Lebanon, and implementing U.N. Security Council resolution
425.
</P>
<P>
Meguid appealed for preparatory efforts to convene an Arab
summit, even a mini-summit, to discuss the extent to which matters
have reached in the Arab world. He appealed to Tunisian President
Zine Abidine Ben Ali whose country is the present chairman of the
Arab League session, to convene an Arab summit.
</P>
<P>
Also addressing today's opening session, Lebanese Foreign
Minister Boueiz said the flagrant Israeli aggressions against his
country, initiated by Israeli domestic electoral considerations,
were premeditated and aimed at specific targets.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz accused Israel of seeking, through its aggressions
against Lebanon, to create security, social and economic problems
in his country. Israel's objective, he said, is to revive the
civil war in Lebanon by pushing the displaced people from south
Lebanon to the north, and to expand the occupied border strip to
the Litani river bank and then turn the area into a security
zone in line with its standards and conceptions.
</P>
<P>
He called upon the Arab states to adopt a unified stance to
this crisis, indicating that the Israeli danger was not restricted
to Lebanon alone but also to all Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese minister affirmed his country's commitment to
peace on the basis of the land-for-peace principle, implementation
of international legitimacy resolutions, and return to the
international boundaries between Lebanon and Israel, pointing out
that once this target is achieved the security of Israel would be
established.
</P>
<P>
The emergency meeting is being attended by 16 Arab states at
foreign ministers' level, and six states at the level of permanent
delegates.

CAIRO, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Palestine National Council
(PNC) will convene next Monday as scheduled, if Israel does not
obstruct the arrival of the PNC members to the Palestinian
territories.
</P>
<P>
This was declared today by Nabil Abu Radina, adviser to
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, in statements to the Gaza
correspondent of the Middle East News Agency (MENA).
</P>
<P>
Abu Radina called upon Israel to adhere to the agreements
already signed, and to refrain from turning the Palestinian
territories and the peace process into an election card.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the Palestinian National Authority's condemnation
of the Israeli aggressions against Lebanon. He said Israel was
besieging Lebanon with arms and the Palestinian territories with
starvation, thus threatening the whole peace process.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that comprehensive and just peace as well as the
recognition of the Palestinian government were the only way out of
the prevailing state of tension and violence.

UNITED NATIONS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations today
appealed for 13 million U.S. dollars to address the humanitarian
needs of persons displaced as a result of the conflict in the
Chechnya region.
</P>
<P>
According to the world organization, the fighting in Chechnya
has forced approximately 500,000 persons from their homes, roughly
half its populations, many of whom have fled to Daghestan,
Ingushetia and North Ossetia.

<P>
The 1996 U.N. consolidated inter-agency appeal for the
Chechnya region covers the period 1 January through 31 December,
with the exception of the activities of the World Food Programme,
which will continue through March 1997.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. humanitarian program aims to meet the
emergency needs of those who have fled to Daghestan, Ingushetia
and North Ossetia, targeting those believed to be most in need,
currently estimated at 92,000.
</P>
<P>
The inter-agency appeal covers programs in the areas of food
aid, health, shelter, and water and sanitation.

KAMPALA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Rwandese Minister of Transport
Charles Marigande has invited Ugandans and other industrialists
to invest in Rwanda where he said vast opportunities exist, Radio
Uganda reported today.
</P>
<P>
Marigande who received donations to victims of the 1994
genocide in Rwanda from the Indian community living in London
said here yesterday that instead of receiving donations, the
people of Rwanda would be delighted if the Indian Madhvani family
established another sugar estate in Rwanda to ensure continuity
of such a commodity in the country.

</P>
<P>
The Madhvani family which made arrangements for the hand over
ceremony also donated blankets, sugar, cooking oil, soap and tea.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan Minister of Finance and Economic Planning, Mayanja
Nkangi, who represented Prime Minister Kintu Musoke, said it was
appropriate that the donations were handed over in Uganda which
he said had for a long time been host to the Rwandese people who
are now settled at home.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Send Humanitarian Aid to Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkey, which has kept its voice
down regarding the Israeli raids on Lebanon, announced today it
would send humanitarian aid to the displaced Lebanese people.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey wants to join in the international efforts to help the
displaced people in Lebanon," said Foreign Ministry spokesman
Omer Akbel.
</P>
<P>
He told a weekly press conference that Turkey had pledged aid
as soon as the needs of the people were determined.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's decision comes one day after Lebanese Ambassador to
Ankara Cafer Muhammad Muawi met with Turkish Foreign Minister
Emre Gonensay and asked for Turkey's help for the 350,000
displaced Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
Muawi also urged Ankara to use its influence on Israel to stop
the raids.
</P>
<P>
Turkey Tuesday expressed its concern regarding the Israel
operation and called on the Jewish state to end the operation as
soon as possible, but still shied away from any condemnation.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's attitude was largedly attributed to its past record
of cross-border operations in northern Iraq to hit the separatist
Kurdish rebels entrenched there.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the spokesman said that Israeli jets had arrived in
Turkey for routine training flights but did not give details.
</P>
<P>
A controversial Turco-Israeli military accord enables unarmed
Israeli warplanes to use Turkish air space for training purpose
but has been a target of criticism from Arab states.

JOHANNESBURG, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Secretary-General of
Namibia's ruling party, the Southwest African People's
Organization (SWAPO), Moses Garoeb, has been replaced by Deputy
Minister of Foreign Affairs Mrs Netumbo Ndaitwah.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference on Tuesday in Windhoek, Capital of
Namibia, Garoeb said he had taken leave of party duties to devote
his energies to his job as Minister of Labor and Manpower
Development, the South African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
Garoeb said Mrs. Ndaitwah's appointment signaled a transfer of
power by SWAPO to the younger generation.
</P>
<P>
He also said he was pleased with the decision by the Political
Bureau, saying, ''This is a significant event in the history of
the party''.
</P>
<P>
Mrs Ndaitwah was appointed Deputy Secretary-General by the
SWAPO Politburo last weekend, said the report.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the SWAPO constitution only a party's national
congress, due to be held later this year, can elect a
secretary-general and there is no provision for an acting
secretary-general.

<HEADLINE> French, US Proposals on Ceasefire Based on Common </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking official in the
Lebanese Foreign Ministry noted here today that there was a
"common ground" between the two proposals put forward recently by
France and the U.S. for setting up a ceasefire in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Taher Hassan, secretary general of the Foreign Ministry, said
that "between the French and U.S. proposals there is a common
ground based on the July understanding."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the first aim for Lebanon was a "stop of the
(Israeli) agressions."
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held in his office this afternoon,
Hassan pointed out that the French and U.S. proposals were being
studied and discussed and contacts were continuing in order to
reach a solution.
</P>
<P>
He said that a decision of the U.N. Security Council to keep
its session open came within a "framework of putting the Security
Council's hands on the Lebanese complaints, a move allowing
Lebanon to complete its contacts with the non-allied countries
and to finish mapping out a resolution through secret rather than
public meetings."
</P>
<P>
Hassan disclosed that the U.S. proposal contains an item
stipulating an Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon after a
nine-month lapse of tranquility was safeguarded on the border.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berri received today a
telephone call from Syrian Vice President Abdul Halim Khaddam
dealing with the present situation and outcomes of current
diplomatic contacts over the French and U.S. proposals on a
ceasefire in Lebanon, according to well-informed official sources.
</P>
<P>
Credible sources said that an enlarged summit between Lebanese
and Syrian leaders would be held in Damascus after Lebanese Prime
Minister Rafik al Hariri coming back from London and Foreign
Minister Farez Boueiz from Cairo in order to "work out a united
position on the U.S. proposal."

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Hopes to See UN Chief's Role Strengthened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government would
prefer to see the role of the U.N. Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali enhanced to help push the Cyprus peace process
forward, government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a daily press briefing, Cassoulides said that the
Cyprus government would also favor other moves to achieve the same
objective.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government would like to see Ghali's role
strengthened preferably through the U.N. Security Council, the
spokesman said, adding that a second option would be joint action
by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, and a
third alternative would be separate moves undertaken by each of
the five permanent members.
</P>
<P>
He said that the third option would be on condition that all
five members should inform one another and aim to make headway in
efforts to solve the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides' comments came ahead of today's informal meeting
of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council in New
York to coordinate their efforts in a bid to move the Cyprus peace
process forward.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash has criticized
Russia for its intention to push forward a proposal by Cyprus'
President Glafcos Clerides for the demilitarization on the island.
</P>
<P>
According to the Turkish Cypriot press today, Denktash also
asked the five permanent council members to "respect the
superiority of the law and apply the rule of law and justice".
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot south and the
Turkish Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and
seized northern third of the island following an Athens-backed
coup.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unsolved despite the U.N. and
international community's peace efforts for the past 22 years.

GENEVA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A panel on U.S. limit on Textile
import from India was established on Wednesday under the dispute
settlement procedure of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Establishment of the panel at the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB)
meeting came in response to India's complaints about the United
States restraint on the import of women's and girls' woolcoat from
it.
</P>
<P>
Indian trade representative criticized at the meeting the U.S.
continuation of the restraint after the last meeting on March 27,
at which the U.S. said it" several months ago,... became convinced
that the restraint... was no longer necessary."
</P>
<P>
India has maintained that it is unjustifiable for the U.S. to
make the unilateral restraint on the import of women's and girls'
woolcoat, which will come into effect from April 18.
</P>
<P>
India earlier said in a statement that the U.S. did not make
clear in previous bilateral consultations whether or not the
import formed "serious damage or actual threat" to the U.S.
producers.
</P>
<P>
U.S. trade officials here said the U.S. did consider dropping
the restraint and tried to arrange a meeting between the chief
textile negotiators. They still maintained that the U.S. restraint
was fully justified.

ANKARA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati will come to Ankara Friday after a tense period in
Turco-Iranian relations caused by espionage accusations against
each other's diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Velayati will come to Ankara to deliver to President Suleyman
Demirel the invitation of his Iranian counterpart Hashemi
Rafsanjani to the opening of Turkmenistan-Meshet (Iran) railway.
</P>
<P>
The opening ceremony is scheduled in May, marking a step
toward the new Silk Road on railway which aims at linking Turkey
with eastern China through Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
"But Velayati's visit will naturally provide an opportunity
for both sides to assess bilateral ties and regional
developments," Turkey's Foreign Ministry spokesman Omer Akbel
said today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the local Anatolia News Agency quoted an official

<HEADLINE> IMF Foresees Continued World Growth in 1996, 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) said today that world growth has continued, on average,
at a satisfactory pace, backed in particular by buoyant growth in
many emerging market countries.
</P>
<P>
In its semi-annual World Economic Outlook, the IMF said that it
has trimmed its forecast for world economic growth this year due
to a slowdown which has spread in industrial nations especially in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
The IMF expects the world economy to grow by 3.8 percent this
year. That is faster than last year's pace of 3.5 percent but
slower than the 4.1 percent growth rate projected by the fund for
1996 last October. Economic growth is forecast to pick up to 4.3
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said subdued global inflation, low long-term interest
rates, buoyant stock prices and a stronger dollar all point to
"relatively solid" world economic growth in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
"Overall, there do not seem to be grounds to expect a prolonged
or generalized slowdown, and global growth is projected to pick
up," it said.
</P>
<P>
However, it noted that growth slowed more markedly than
expected during 1995 in Western Europe and North America, leading
to further increases in unemployment in some countries from
already high levels and also to fears of a new economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
The IMF expects Germany's economy to grow by a mere 1 percent
this year, and France's, 1.3 percent. Growth in 1997 is expected
to pick up, to 2.9 and 2.8 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The IMF forecast steady U.S. growth -- 1.8 percent this year
and 2.2 percent in 1997, no change in its last year prediction.
While U.S. long-term interest rates have recently climbed, they
remain well below levels seen in early 1995, it said.
</P>
<P>
The fund though warned of a "significant risk" to the U.S.
expansion if the Clinton administration and Congress fail to reach
an agreement to balance the federal government budget.
</P>
<P>
The IMF gave a better picture of the outlook for the Japanese
economy after years of a virtual recession. The fund expects
Japanese growth of 2.7 percent this year and 3.1 percent next,
compared with just 0.9 percent in 1995. The Japanese economy has
been aided by a steep fall in the value of the yen, after its rise
to record levels a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Japan's economy has also been aided by sharp cuts in short-term
interest rates. The IMF said though that those will need to be
raised once the recovery is well established.
</P>
<P>
The fund also sees brighter times ahead for Canada, with growth
accelerating to 2.9 percent in 1997 from 1.9 percent in 1996 and
2.2 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The 188-page IMF report also noted that the emerging market
economies of Asia are likely to remain particularly buoyant,
although growth is expected to moderate in several of them. But
this should help to alleviate inflationary pressures and reduce
current account imbalances associated in part with large private
capital inflows. The growth in developing countries as a whole
this year is expected to reach 6.3 percent and continues the track
to 6.4 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, countries in transition are heading for significant
recovery from -1.3 percent last year to 2.5 percent growth this
year and 3.8 percent next year.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Parliament Condemns Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Lower House of Parliament
here today condemned the Israeli onslaught on Lebanon as "vicious
aggression" and declared its solidarity with the Lebanese people.
</P>
<P>
In an statement issued after an informal session here today,
the house said the Israeli bombardment revealed the real face of
Israel "whose acceptance of the peace process was only a tactic
aimed at broadening its occupation and imposing its economic and
political domination over the entire region."
</P>
<P>
Israel launched bombardment and air raids on Lebanon last
Thursday in retaliation for Shiite Moslem guerrilla group
Hezbollah's Katyusha rocket attacks on northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
The house praised King Hussein's efforts on both the Arab and
the international levels to end the Israeli military campaign in
Lebanon, stressing that the Israeli occupation of a border enclave
in south Lebanon was a breach of U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli military actions have killed some 50, wounded 160
and displaced 200,000 Lebanese, almost all of them civilians.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti paid a visit to
Israel Tuesday in a bid to mediate between Lebanon and Israel and
warned Israel that its military actions in Lebanon threatened the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials hinted that an agreement for an end to
hostilities in Lebanon could be near.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Information Marwan Muasher, who accompanied
Kabariti on the visit, told reporters upon his return home
Tuesday that "we expect the results of efforts for an end to the
crisis on the Lebanese front in the next few days."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jordan Tuesday sent humanitarian and in-kind
assistance to Lebanon, including 13 truck-load tents, blankets,
medicine and food.

MAPUTO, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano said he had today received cooperation from visiting
Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa to fight illegal gold mining
of some Tanzanians in Mozambique's northern province of Niassa.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique has maintained that the illegal gold miners might

opened a number of branches in South Tanzania bordering
Mozambique aimed at buying the gold from the illegal miners.
</P>

Zairens, Malawians, Zambians have also been taking part in the
illegal gold mining since 1990, causing huge loss to Mozambique's

The two presidents also discussed ways to loose the control
of border trade between the two countries, among other issues.

<HEADLINE> African VAT Conference Opens In Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A 10-day African value added tax
(VAT) conference opened here today.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the opening conference, Uganda's Minister of
Finance and Economic Planning, Mayanja Nkagi, allayed the fears
among the general public about the perceived or imagined demerits
of the VAT system which would be in force from July this year.
</P>
<P>
He said the objective of the tax reform was to simplify the
taxation system with low rates of tax and to encourage tax
compliance, while at the same time stimulating private sector
growth.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that apart from increasing revenue for the
government to fund its own essential expenditures, the tax reform
was to ensure equity in treatment of taxpayers and minimize
variations and exemptions across industries and other sectors.
</P>
<P>
Nkangi urged the participants to discuss the issue involved in
the implementation of VAT so that they could learn not to repeat the
mistake made by others and also devise mechanisms suitable for their
countries.
</P>
<P>
Senior tax officials from Ghana, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and Uganda
are attending the conference.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief: Georgian-Abkhaz Peace Process Remains Stalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali said today that despite many months of
vigorous efforts and intensive talks by the U.N. and the Russian
Federation, the Georgian-Abkhaz peace process remains stalled.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Security Council, Boutros-Ghali said the
situation is mainly caused by continued disagreement over the
political status of Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
The Abkhaz leadership now recognizes that Abkhazia will be part
of a single Georgian state within the boundaries of the former
Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic as at December 21, 1991, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
But pronounced differences remain over the constitutional
definition of the Georgian state, the report added.
</P>
<P>
While the Georgian side wants a draft conflict-ending protocol
reflecting that Georgia is one single federal state, the Abkhaz
side demands that the draft protocol describe the state as a union
which came about as the result of a treaty between two subjects of
equal status under international law.
</P>
<P>
"While this stalemate continues, there can be no significant
improvement in the situation of displaced persons and refugees,
whose plight is a cause of great concern," Boutros-Ghali said.
</P>
<P>
He said at this moment it is important for the Untied Nations
to strengthen its role in the search for a comprehensive
settlement.

JOHANNESBURG, April 17 (Xinhua) -- France has set a target for

<HEADLINE> Employers Targeted for Hiring Illegal Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Sweeps in 19 states, Puerto
Rico and the Virgin Islands since late March resulted in the
arrest of 1,176 undocumented workers, most of whom have been
deported, U.S. Justice Department officials announced today.
</P>
<P>
Three illegal aliens wanted in connection with criminal
charges, including one sought in New York on attempted murder
charges, were among those apprehended, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
At least 15 of the 100 employers targeted during the raids
could face fines of up to 2,000 dollars per worker for violating
immigration laws, Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)
officials said. Three businesses holding federal contracts may be
barred from future federal work under a new presidential executive
order if found to have knowingly violated the law.
</P>
<P>
"We're showing that enforcing our workplace laws is a top
priority," Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
INS Deputy Commissioner Chris Sale said industries known for
using illegal labor were targeted, including the New York garment
industry, food processors in Maryland and the South and furniture
makers in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The sweeps freed up 15.5 million dollars in wages for legal
workers, Gorelick said. The agency is working with state
employment agencies to help them find legal workers to fill the
jobs.
</P>
<P>
Similar operations have been held in recent months in the
Southwest and Midwest.
</P>
<P>
Immigrant-rights groups have denounced the sweeps, saying they
discriminate against people of different ethnic origins. They also
argue that the raids are terrifying to legal immigrants.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Not Asking for Increasing Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The Secretary General of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Rilwanu
Lukman, said here today that Iraq has not asked for increasing its
quota when it resumes oil marketing.
</P>
<P>
"The question of (production) ceiling of OPEC is a matter
within the jurisdiction of OPEC conferences. The decisions on
quotas are not taken simply to accommodate Iraq, but take into
account the situation and the circumstances of the market before
ceilings are set." he said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been kept out of the world oil market since the
U.N. imposed trade sanctions for its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait. Before the U.N. sanctions Iraq was pumping 3.5 million
barrels of oil a day into the world market.
</P>
<P>
Lukman said that OPEC will hold an extraordinary session when
Iraq re-enters the world market if the talks between Iraq and the
U.N. on an oil-for-food deal conclude successfully.
</P>
<P>
"What OPEC will do in the next few months will depend on the
outcome of the discussions that are going on in New York. We are
keenly watching," he said.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question on other OPEC members' attitude
toward Iraq's return to the oil market, he said, "We are waiting
anxiously to welcome Iraq back into the market, Iraq is not out of
OPEC, it is rather a strong member -- it is just coming back into
the market."
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed Rashid said that Iraq
definitely believes that the market should be stable and not
affected negatively in terms of prices of a barrel. For 20 years,
Iraq has taken the position and policy of solidarity with OPEC
member states, adhering to shares and price controls, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC official, together with current OPEC Chairman Omar
Mekhloufi, arrived here Tuesday night for the first visit to Iraq
since 1991. They had already visited a number of oil producers in
the Gulf area.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Hopes to Attract 500,000 Tourists in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Nepal hopes to attract 500,000
foreign tourists in 1998. Even though it is still two years away,
the government is already planning a national campaign to promote
the tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Tourism Chakra Prasad Bastola announced today that
the government had decided to launch a program called "Visit Nepal
Year" in 1998, which is aimed at attracting more tourists by
diversifying tourism activities across the country.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the government would encourage the tourism
industry to impart a good image of Nepal to all visitors so that
they may visit the country for a second time, the minister told a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government would pay special attention to
promoting eco-tourism attractions as well as other novel tourism
activities to cater to new tourism trends in the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is a main source of the country's revenue and also a
major foreign exchange earner. More than 300,000 tourists arrive
in Nepal every year, bringing in nearly 90 million US dollars for
the country.
</P>
<P>
Indians, who come to Nepal mainly for shopping and pilgrimage,
account for the largest share of the tourists visiting Nepal,
while those from Western countries make up the second largest
group of tourists in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Trekking and mountaineering are usually the two most popular
activities among Western visitors in Nepal.

"China is willing to expand co-operation in the above-mentioned
projects with all countries in the world in terms of funds,
technology and trade," Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government has paid great attention to
improving conditions for overseas investment, and is convinced
that there will be rapid progress in this field in the coming five
years.
</P>
<P>
Li attributed China's healthy economic growth also to
co-operation and support from the international
community. "China's rapid economic expansion will surely provide a
huge opportunity for manufacturers and business people worldwide
to invest and develop trade," he added.
</P>
<P>
China has a great market potential, a contingent of qualified
scientists and technicians, and a low cost of labor. In addition,
its investment conditions are improving.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign investors with the spirit of sincere co-operation and
having their eyes on the future will surely find success in
China," Li said.
</P>
<P>
In the present-day world, the vice-premier said, China's
development requires exchanges and co-operation with other
countries. In addition, the world's peace, stability and
development also require China's co-operation. "Only by increasing
mutual understanding and co-operation can we achieve common
development," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"As a developing country with a population of 1.2 billion,
China, by its pursuit of reform, development and stability, is
making active contributions to the world's peace, stability and
prosperity," Li said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Two panels of the Preparatory
Committee (PC) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR) have achieved the goal in their meetings in Hong Kong, a
senior Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua here today, Lu Ping, vice
chairman of the PC, said that the PC will continue to implement
the principle of "Hong Kong people running Hong Kong and the HKSAR
enjoying high-degree autonomy" so as to ensure Hong Kong's smooth
transition and enduring stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Lu, also director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of
China's State Council, said, "With the participation of the Hong
Kong people, we are confident in the preparations for the
establishment of the HKSAR."
</P>
<P>
On the advice-seeking program organized by the PC Selection
Committee Panel, he said that more than 1,000 people from 362
organizations attended the two-day meetings last weekend, adding
that the meetings were democratic.
</P>
<P>
He said that most of the participants had put forward
suggestions, including different views, on the basis of endorsing
the two tasks of the Selection Committee -- selecting the Chief
Executive and selecting the Provisional Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
He said that most of the views expressed are positive, in hopes
that the Selection Committee will be broadly representative, it
will choose a Chief Executive acceptable to various circles and it
will produce a Provisional Legislative Council that can take into
account Hong Kong's overall and long-term interests.
</P>
<P>
The consultations showed that the majority of the Hong Kong
people wish to see a smooth transition and adopt a supportive
attitude instead of an antagonistic one to the decisions of the
Preparatory Committee, he said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Tax Collection Falls Short of Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's tax revenue has
slipped off the target by more than TK 3 billion (75 million US
dollars) in the first three quarters of the current fiscal
beginning last July.
</P>
<P>
According to reliable sources here today, total tax revenue
receipt in the July-March period stood at TK 75.6 billion (1.89
billion dollars), below the target of TK 78.6 billion (1.965
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry has confirmed the slump, attributing it to
the sharp fall in the collection of customs duty, particularly in
February and March due to political turbulence in the country.
</P>
<P>
Customs duty collection, which totaled TK 26.3 billion (657.5
million dollars) up to March, fell short of the target by more
than 8 percent, the ministry said, adding that poor return from
income tax was also a factor behind the slump.

<HEADLINE> Gap Between Rich and Poor Widens in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The gap between rich and poor has
been widening across Britain in the past 15 years, according to a
report by the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG).
</P>
<P>
In its study of poverty, the group found that while average
income in Britain rose 37 percent between 1979 and 1993, the
poorest section of the population saw income fall 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
As a result, by 1993 nearly 14 million people were living in
poverty, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, in 1979 only five million people, equivalent to
nine percent of the population, were in similar straits.
</P>
<P>
In its conclusion, the report calls for a combination of strong
employment rights, more flexible benefits, and a more progressive
tax structure to help reverse the trend.

<HEADLINE> Kasagic: Serbs Get No Aid from World Bodies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb Premier Rajko
Kasagic said today the Serb state Republika Srpska had not
received a single dollar so far from international community for
its reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Tanjug news agency, Kasagic said the
Muslim-Croat federation in Bosnia, which he said was favored by
the United States and Germany, had already received more than 130
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Of this sum, 65 million dollars have been donated by the
European Fund for Social Development, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs, however, had until recently been denied contacts
with the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other
international institutions due to the U.N. Security Council
sanctions against the Republika Srpska, he said. The
U.N. sanctions were suspended in late February after the serbs had
fully complied with the Dayton agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Republika Srpska has prepared about 2,750 recovery and
reconstruction programs that are to be financed by the
international community, he said.
</P>
<P>
The recent donor conference in Brussles has raised more than
1.2 billion U.S. dollars for the economic recovery and
reconstruction of Bosnia. But the Serbs did not attend the
conference because it refused to go to Brussels as part of the
joint Bosnian delegation headed by the prime minister of the
Muslim-Croat federation.
</P>
<P>
The condition for financial assistance to the Republika Srpska
were elections scheduled for September, but no conditions for the
assistance were set to the Muslim-Croat federation, Kasagic
complained.
</P>
<P>
International community High Representative Carl Bildt has said
that the Serbs could not get international financial aid unless
the Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his military chief Ratko
Mladic step down. The two senior Serb leaders have been indicted
by the Hague-based international war crimes tribunal as war
criminals.
</P>
<P>
The Serb prime minister also said the Republika Srpska's future
rested upon establishment of ties with all neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
"We have been at war with neighboring peoples and states three
times in this century and the time has now come to overcome war
and mutual killings and to establish cooperation based on economic
interests."
</P>
<P>
He also said the Serb entity had already opened talks with the
former Yugoslav republics of Croatia and Slovenia on economic
cooperation and bilateral relations.

BONN, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic Committee
(IOC) earned more than three billion U.S. dollars between 1993 and
1996 and predicts a brighter future, IOC marketing director
Michael Payne said in Frankfurt on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It is the biggest sports-marketing program of all times,

Payne added that further money will be distributed to the

</P>
<P>
The IOC itself keeps six per cent (around 180 million
U.S. dollars), of which it pays its annual budget of 30 million
U.S. dollars. The rest is added to savings which Payne said were

<HEADLINE> Panda Electronics Giant To Go Public In HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Nanjing Panda Electronics
Company Limited, China's second largest producer of color TV sets,
 will go public in Hong Kong soon.
</P>
<P>
It will be the second Chinese state-owned enterprise listed
this year at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, bringing to 19 the
total number of H shares.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing Panda, one of China's largest diversified electronics
manufacturer, will offer 242 million H shares at a price between
2.1 and 2.35 HK dollars (27 to 30 US cents) each.
</P>
<P>
Public subscription, which makes up 20 percent of the total
offer, will start Friday in Hong Kong; and the rest will be for
international placing by institutional investors, according to
Peregrine Capital Limited, the sponsor and lead manager of the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Transaction of the Panda shares is expected to commence on May
2, 1996 at the Hong Kong bourse. In an exclusive interview with
Xinhua, Chen Xiangxing, chairman of Nanjing Panda, said: "We have
full confidence that we will make the issue a success and so far
the offer for institutional investors is going on very well,"
</P>
<P>
The electronics giant hopes to raise 500 million HK dollars (64
 million US dollars) by issue of H shares.
</P>
<P>
Chen said 60 percent of the money raised will be used to
develop new products such as mobile phones, satellite
communications systems, digital television sets and multi-media
personal computers. The remaining 40 percent will be for liquidity
 use.
</P>
<P>
Chen said Nanjing Panda has long planned to build itself into a
 diversified electronics manufacturer, and the listing in Hong
Kong will help make the dream come true.
</P>
<P>
Television sets accounted for 75 percent of the after-tax
profits in 1995, while other products, mainly telecommunications
systems, made up for the rest. Chen said he hoped that the share
of TV sets in the whole profit will gradually fall to 50 percent
till the year 2000, and up-to-date products will increase their
contributions.
</P>
<P>
Chen said: "One of our key development strategies is to join
hands with the world's leading companies in telecommunications and
 electronics fields."
</P>
<P>
Nanjing Panda has set up two joint ventures, one with Ericsson
of Sweden and the other with Motorola of the United States. A new
cooperative plan with Sharp of Japan has been nailed down to
produce digitalized audio and visual products, he added.
</P>
<P>
The company has a leading edge in research and development. It
has two national research centers, one for visual and audio
engineering and the other for mobile telecommunications.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe To Further Liberalise Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe today said the government will this year take further
measures to liberalise the economy and attract new domestic and
foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at festivities to mark Zimbabwe's 16th independence
anniversary here, Mugabe said preparations were underway to
launch the second phase of the economic structural adjustment
program, whose first five-year phase ended last December.
</P>
<P>
He said emphasis would be on liberalising the investment
climate and reforming the public enterprises, which donors want
to be privatised to improve efficiency and eliminate their
dependence on the government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the government had been deliberately slow in
privatising parastatals until it had worked out a mechanism to
ensure that the indigenous business sector benefited from the
exercise.
</P>
<P>
In the civil service, Mugabe said the government would also
take more measures to improve delivery of service, such as
conducting more training programs and introducing a new
performance management system.
</P>
<P>
He said economic performance this year would grow from less
than one percent in 1995 to about seven percent this year,
largely due to the recovery of the key agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
Last year's drought, he said, caused a 12.5 percent fall in
agricultural production, while manufacturing output declined by
about 14 percent.
</P>

to be integral and inseparable parts of China.
</P>

<HEADLINE> "China Threat" Groundless, Chinese Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior official with the State
Council Development Research Center (SCDRC) rebutted the "China
threat" theory as groundless at an on-going international
conference here today.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that China is still a country with a per capita
income in the world's lower ranks.
</P>
<P>
Even if China makes some progress and becomes stronger
economically, it will not pose a threat to any country, said SCDRC
President Sun Shangqing at the China Business Congress, which
opened here Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Though China has opened itself wider to the outside world, it
must follow a development pattern with "internal circulation" as
the principal form of economic growth because of its huge
population, large territory and huge economic scale, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
A number of international organizations have made optimistic
estimates of China's economic strength and its future
development. However, China adopts a sober-minded and realistic
attitude toward such assessments.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the State Statistical Bureau showed that
the per capita Gross National Product (GNP) of China in 1995 was
only 4,700 yuan, (about 570 US dollars), much lower than that of
developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The enormous potential of the Chinese market will constitute
not only a very important factor for its sustained economic
growth, but also create opportunities for cooperation partners in
other countries, the president said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that all overseas entrepreneurs would
enhance their co-operation with China in agriculture,
infrastructure, hi-tech and pillar industries, and invest in the
development of the central and western parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Referring to regional development, Sun said, China will speed
up the development of its central and western parts while
maintaining the rapid growth of the eastern coastal regions in the
next few years.
</P>
<P>
Efforts have been made to construct the Yangtze River Economic
Belt, which embraces seven provinces and the municipality of
Shanghai, the Bohai Rim Economic Belt and economic belts along the
Beijing-Kowloon railway line and the Asian-European Continental
Bridge. These new economic belts will become rising dynamic areas
in China's economic development and likely to bring a shift of
emphasis in its future development pattern.
</P>
<P>
China will do its best to act in accordance with international
conventions and give overseas-funded firms national treatment. It
has lowered the overall customs tariff from 36 percent to 23
percent, and it will finally be reduced to the level of other
developing countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
With the development of a socialist market economy, Sun said in
conclusion, China will continue to improve the environment for
foreign economic co-operation and open wider to the outside
world.

<HEADLINE> Lu Ping on HK Provisional Legislative Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The establishment of the
Provisional Legislative Council in Hong Kong is to fill in the
vacancy in the legislative body as the first legislative council
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) can not be
elected according to the Basic Law, a senior Chinese official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua here today, Lu Ping, vice
chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the HKSAR, noted that
this is the result of Chris Patten's "Constitutional Package"
which violated the agreement reached between the Chinese and
British governments and disrupted the "through train" arrangements
for legislators as provided for by the related decision of the
Chinese National People's Congress and the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
Lu Ping, who is also director of the Hong Kong and Macao
Affairs Office of the Chinese State Council, said that to ensure
the normal operation of the SAR on July 1, 1997, some laws
concerning the establishment of the SAR and the basic rights of
the Hong Kong people must be enacted.
</P>
<P>
He said that according to the Basic Law, the Chief Executive
and principal officials of the SAR must be Chinese citizens
selected from among Hong Kong permanent residents who have no
right of abode in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
This involves the question of how China's Nationality Law is
implemented in Hong Kong, he explained. Although the Preparatory
Committee has put forward suggestions in principle, it still
requires the Provisional Legislative Council to make specific
legal stipulations.
</P>
<P>
The candidates for the Chief Justice of the Court of Final
Appeal and the Chief Judge of the High Court of the SAR will be
recommended by an independent commission for the Chief
Executive-designate to obtain endorsement of the Provisional
Legislative Council, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Without the Provisional Legislative Council, the Court of
Final Appeal can not be formed before July 1, 1997 and the SAR
will not be able to function. This is a fact we must face," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Lu Ping noted that the Preliminary Working Committee of the
Preparatory Committee had solicited opinions of various sectors
and studied many schemes for a solution to the vacancy of the
legislative body. After comparison and analysis, the
establishment of the Provisional Legislative Council can better
embody the principle of "Hong Kong people running Hong Kong".
</P>
<P>
According to the NPC decision on April 4, 1990 and the decision
of the NPC Standing Committee decision on August 31, 1994, the
Preparatory Committee is authorized to make the decision on
forming the Provisional Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
He said that the establishment of the Provisional Legislative
Council is part of the preparations for forming the first
Legislative Council which will be elected after the SAR is
founded.
</P>
<P>
On the different views on this question, Lu Ping said that some
of the views against the establishment of the Provisional
Legislative Council were totally unreasonable and were raised out
of political motives.
</P>
<P>
He said that some views against the establishment of the
Provisional Legislative Council were raised because of
insufficient understanding of the background and the legal basis
on this question.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Some people still fail to understand the legal basis
after we have made the explanation. They can reserve their views
and we will never impose the views of the Preparatory Committee on
them."

<HEADLINE> Japan's Trade Surplus Continued to Fall in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Japan's trade surplus fell for the
second straight year in fiscal 1995 to 96.2 billion U.S. dollars,
the Japanese Finance Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
A drop of 18.4 percent in Japan's merchandise trade
surplus reflects the nation's trading pattern amid moves of
companies to shift production bases in a bid to avoid foreign
exchange risks and take advantage of lower costs.
</P>
<P>
Japan's trade surplus with the United States also dropped 27.1
percent to 40.58 billion U.S. dollars, causing to its first
decline in five years, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
On a customs-clearance basis, Japan's overall exports in
1995 rose 7.7 percent to 440.1 billion U.S. dollars while imports
grew 18.4 percent to 343.89 billion dollars, added the ministry.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Members Urged To Strengthen Regional Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Vice-president Godfrey
Miyanda today urged all member states of the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) to strengthen the regional
body so as to facilitate regional economic integration.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president made the call at the opening of the COMESA
second meeting of the council of ministers in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Miyanda said COMESA was created to enable regional indigenous
manufacturing entreprises to secure an international market of
their products.
</P>
<P>
Zambia would continue to support the inter-state cooperation
in COMESA as stated in the COMESA treaty, Miyanda reiterated.
</P>
<P>
Frustrating regional intergration would be taking Africa three
decades backwards, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He advised member states not to fall in a trap hindering
regional unity for creating an enabling environment for eocnomic
development in the region.
</P>
<P>
COMESA, grouping 23 states in the region, was born out of the
Preferential Trade Area for Eastern and Southern Africa (PTA) in
1994.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, some countries in southern Africa have suggested
that COMESA is too large, it should be split into northern and
southern groupings.

<HEADLINE> Lu Ping on HK Civil Servants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Lu Ping, director of the Hong
Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, today urged
the British side to get a clear understanding of the reality on
the issue of the civil servants in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua here, Lu Ping, who is
vice chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), said that the Chief
Executive-designate and principal officials-designate of the HKSAR
 will be selected before July 1, 1997, and the Chinese side is not
 willing to see an overhaul of the principal officials.
</P>
<P>
"As far as we are concerned, the incumbent principal officials
are expected to remain," he noted.
</P>
<P>
When the principal officials join the regional
government-designate, they will face the issue of being answerable
 to the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC), Lu Ping said.
</P>
<P>
For example, the Chief Executive-designate must submit
administrative address and draft budget to the PLC, and the
government must submit draft bills to the PLC.
</P>
<P>
The question now, Lu Ping said, is that Chris Patten has said
time and again that no "dual loyalty" is permitted for Hong Kong
civil servants and that the PLC is illegal, saying he will
neither recognize the status of the PLC nor give assistance to
it. This has exerted great pressure on the 180,000 HK civil
servants.
</P>
<P>
Lu Ping expressed the hope that the Chinese and British sides
will create the conditions together for a steady transition of the
 civil servant contingent, instead of creating troubles for them.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese side has never said that the civil servants
 are required to make statements to support the PLC before
1997. "Civil servants should remain politically neutral," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"At present, the civil servants are serving the British Hong
Kong government. After July 1, 1997 they will serve the SAR
government. The establishment of the PLC is an objective reality,
and the Chinese side believes that the civil servants can accept
it," he added.
</P>
<P>
Both the Chinese side and the British side should adopt a
practical attitude to handle this issue properly, he said.

HONG KONG, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Lu Ping, director of the Hong
Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, expressed the
hope today that the British side will cooperate before and after
1997.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua here today, Lu Ping, who
is also vice chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the future
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), said that the
Preparatory Committee has given the Hong Kong government a
detailed list for assistance, but the British side has so far made
no response.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the Hong Kong government will fulfill its commitment
of cooperation with the Preparatory Committee," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that the talks between the Chinese
and British foreign ministers in the Hague later this week will
make some progress on the cooperation over the Hong Kong issue.
</P>
<P>
Lu Ping said the working principle of the Chinese side is
"taking ourselves as the mainstay, catering to the Hong Kong
people and relying on them".
</P>
<P>
"On the one hand we will try to win over cooperation, while on
the other hand we will stick to the principle of 'taking ourselves
as the mainstay'," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Ourselves" here means both the Chinese government and Hong
Kong people, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Many Okinawans Dissatisfied With Clinton's Diet Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 19 (Xinhua) -- Many Okinawans today expressed
dissatisfaction over U.S. President Bill Clinton's address to the
Japanese Diet (parliament), the Kyodo News reported today.
</P>
<P>
Some Okinawans argued that Clinton's apology for the rape of an
Okinawan schoolgirl by three U.S. servicemen is inadequate.
</P>
<P>
The rape of the 12-year-old girl last September, for which the
three American servicemen have been convicted and sentenced to
jail terms, sparked fierce protests across Japan against the
U.S. military presence on the southernmost main island, home to
28,000 of the 47,000 U.S. troops now stationed in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The visiting U.S. president said in the Diet: "The American
people profoundly regret the horrible violence done to the young
schoolgirl.
</P>
<P>
"Our hearts go to her, to her family and loved ones, and to the
entire Okinawan community. We are gratified that just has been
done," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
But many Okinawans remained angered as they feel Clinton's
apology does not truly reflect the sentiment of the people in the
Okinawan prefecture, Kyodo said in a dispatch filed from Naha,
capital of the island prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Mayumi Tengan, 28, who visited the United States in February to
seek Americans' understanding on the Okinawan situation, was
quoted as saying that "the president's speech is not enough to
dispel the fear and anxiety of women living in Okinawa as it
failed to promise future prevention of similar incidents".
</P>
<P>
Kyodo quoted Tetsuei Tamayose, head of Okinawa's liaison
committee for child upbringing, as saying: "It is nothing new for
the president to apologize for the incident."
</P>
<P>
The 61-year-old said that the incident had caused irreparable
damage on the minds of many children in the prefecture. "Merely
scaling down the size of the military bases cannot be an effective
solution to the problem," he added.

<HEADLINE> 11 Killed in Morning's Israeli Air Raid in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Eleven civilians, including a
four-day-old baby and three other children, were killed in an air
raid at the south Lebanese town of Nabatiyeh Fauga, the Lebanese
Army Command announced in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"On the eighth successive day, Israel is still continuing air
raids and bombardments at most towns and villages in the eastern
and western parts of the south," the Army Command said.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli enemy committed a massacre at the town of
Nabatiyeh Fauga when its warplanes attacked this morning at a
three-floor building, destroying the building and killing 11
citizens, including four children one of whom was only four days
old."
</P>
<P>
"Ten people also were wounded," the statement added, noting
that the army troops in the area were continuing seeking other
missed under the rubble.
</P>
<P>
And the area had been bombarded more than once during the works
of salvation, according to the Army Command statemet.
</P>
<P>
This was the bloodiest air raid at Lebanese civilians since
Israel's "Operation Grapes of Wrath" started on week ago.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in the south reported Israeli warplanes fired
air-to-surface missiles around 7:000 am (4:00 GMT) at the house
resided by Mohammed Aleyan's family when the father was out.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the mother and the family's children, the
biggest of whom was 18 years old, as well as two of their
relatives were all killed in the attack.
</P>
<P>
Israeli helicopters had been flying at low altitute over the
site and preventing ambulances from closing the building and
saving the victims.
</P>
<P>
But local villagers and some Lebanese army soldiers managed to
approach the building and digged out the killed and wounded from
under the ruins, security sources said, adding that the victims
were transported to a hospital in the south Lebanese market town
of Nabatiyeh.
</P>
<P>
And during this air raid, Israeli missiles also destroyed
another building in the same town without causing casualties.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes have launched more than 10 air raids at
Nabatiyed Fauga, Fard Mnita and other villages since this
morning.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli warplanes attacked a car on the Majdel Salim road
and killed the driver.

Lebanon this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Sawt Al-Watan Radio quoted security sources as reporting that
Israeli forces fired artilleries at the Fiji's military center
near the town of Gala, where hundreds of people, dispelled by the
continuous Israeli aggressions from their homelands in the last
days, had found a sanctuary.
</P>

The command of the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon called on
relief agents and ambulances to go to the site

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Posts Higher Economic Growth in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's economic growth
reached 8.07 percent in 1995, up from the 7.48 percent in 1994,
State Minister for National Development Planning Ginandjar
Kartasasmita said today.
</P>
<P>
The country's per capita gross national product (GNP) stood at
978 US dollars in 1995, he said after a meeting with President
Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
He said the government's emphasis was not only on achieving the
targeted figure, although the economic growth rate in 1995
exceeded the planned target of 7.1-percent envisaged in the sixth
Five-Year Development Plan.
</P>
<P>
"We must pay attention also to the even distribution of
development by, among others, setting up infrastructure facilities
outside Java island and improving the quality of human resources,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Indonesia still needs foreign loans.
</P>
<P>
According to Soegito, head of the Central Bureau for
Statistics, the high rate reflected the strong growth of seven
sectors, including agriculture, mining and quarrying, trade,
transportation and communications, finance and service.
</P>
<P>
He said the shift of focus of the economic structure from
agriculture to industry is one of the main factors that pushed the
country's economic growth.

<HEADLINE> "German Industry Benefits From Excellent Political Relations" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The key to German companies'
success in China is the good political relations between the two
governments, said Konrad Seitz, German ambassador to China, here
today.
</P>
<P>
"The most important contribution of the German government to
the success of German companies in China is undoubtedly its
efforts to maintain the excellent political relationship," said
Seitz, addressing the ongoing China Business Congress. "Germany
and China are partners who trust each other."
</P>
<P>
He added, "The federal government has been warning for years
that German industry is underrepresented in China, and in Asia as
a whole, and that the weak position in direct investment is
dangerous for the competitiveness of German companies."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, the German government has provided
information and consultancy services to German companies, offered
soft loans to them, and supported training programs in China so
that German companies can find and hire qualified local staff.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that, with a trade volume in 1995 of 27
billion Deutschmarks (18 billion US dollars), Germany is by far
China's largest European trading partner. German exports to China
are bigger than those of France, Britain and Italy combined, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that German investment in China grew slowly during the
early 1990s because German industry was occupied with rebuilding
the East German economy.
</P>
<P>
"But now that the first phase of rebuilding East Germany is
completed, capital and management resources have become free for
Asia," he said. "And, within Asia, China is the center of the
globalization strategies of German companies."
</P>
<P>
He said that German investment in China started rising quickly
beginning in 1995.
</P>
<P>
For instance, he said, the Siemens Company has, on average,
founded a new joint venture every month in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
The German enthusiasm over their success in China formed a
sharp contrast at the meeting to the gloom of the Boeing
Commercial Airplane Group.
</P>
<P>
Ronald B. Woodard, president of Boeing, expressed
disappointment over China's contract with Airbus.
</P>
<P>
He said that last year the American aviation and space
industry, including Boeing, exported most to China among all
industries.
</P>
<P>
He said that the exports brought about over 200,000 employment
chances to the Americans, benefiting the whole US economy.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, some Americans are still arguing whether to
renew China's most-favored-nation trade status, and some people
even insist on isolating this, the most populous country in the
world.
</P>
<P>
He said that Boeing has been a firm supporter of granting China
most-favored-nation trading status and China's entry into the
World Trade Organization, adding that the US government should not
discriminate against China.
</P>
<P>
James Sasser, US ambassador to China admitted in his speech
that a strong, stable, open and prosperous China will not only
benefit the Chinese people but also benefit the US and its other
international trading partners.
</P>
<P>
The China Business Congress is jointly sponsored by the
Development Research Center of China's State Council, "Business
Week" Magazine and the McGraw-Hill Company of the US. Attending
the event are corporation leaders from China and abroad and
ambassadors from a dozen countries to China.

<HEADLINE> EC Denies Being Partial In Somali Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission has
denied allegations that it is being partial in the on-going
conflicts in the Somali capital Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
An EC statement said here today that Somali faction leader
General Mohamed Farah Aidid recently accused the EC Special Envoy
to Somalia Mr Sigurd Illing of financially supporting Osman
Hassan Ali Atto in South Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The EC statement categorically denied having ever spent a
single European Currency Unit (ECU) in support of any particular
faction, group or clan in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The statement said all EC aid has always been used exclusively
to alleviate the suffering of the Somali people. It reaffirmed
the stand that the primary task of the EC special envoy to
Somalia is to carry out the aid policy of the European Community.
</P>
<P>
The EC statement is a development in relations between General
Aidid and the EC. Earlier Aidid rejected a demand of the EC for a
visit to South Mogadishu. That followed a ban imposed by General
Aidid on the EC envoy from visiting Somalia without the
permission of his administration.
</P>
<P>
He accused the EC envoy of illegally entering in the country
from Beletuein where the envoy had paid a visit to study severe
humanitarian crises.

<P>
They include a treaty on avoidance of double taxation and a

Pakistan has strongly and consistently backed Arab countries,
particularly Syria, in their struggle for the restoration of their
rights in the Middle East, said the APP.
</P>
<P>
It added that Pakistan fully supports Syria's position on the
peace negotiations with Israel and considers Syria as a major
force for peace and stability in the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean President Vows to Punish Election Law Violators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 18 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-sam said today that he asked the prosecution to punish those
who had violated election laws during last week's general
elections.
</P>
<P>
Kim, also president of the ruling New Korea Party (NKP), made
the remark while meeting Kim Dae-jung, president of the main
opposition National Congress for New Politics (NCNP).
</P>
<P>
It was the first one-on-one meeting between the two since Kim
took the presidential office in February 1993.
</P>
<P>
"I've not yet received a full report on the investigation,"
said Kim Young-sam, "but I think a considerable number of
lawmakers-elect will lose their newly-won parliamentary seats as a
result of the investigation."
</P>
<P>
The prosecution said that 108 legislators-elect had violated
the election laws in the 15th National Assembly elections held on
Thursday last week.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 79 were already booked while the remaining 29 are
being preliminarily checked.
</P>
<P>
By party affiliation, the 79 already booked includes 47 from
the NKP, 13 from the NCNP, 13 of the ULD, four of the DP and two
independents.
</P>
<P>
President Kim said that he has instructed the prosecution to
investigate suspected election law violators thoroughly,
regardless of their party affiliations.
</P>
<P>
The NKP secured 139 of the 299 parliamentary seats in the
general elections while the NCNP got 79 seats.
</P>
<P>
The conservative opposition United Liberal Democrats (ULD), the
fourth largest party entering the elections, enjoyed an unexpected
victory by gaining 50 seats whereas the opposition Democratic
Party (DP), the third biggest entering the elections, obtained
only 15 seats.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 16 seats went to independent candidates.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Receive Embargoed US Military Equipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan will begin to receive
some embargoed military equipment from the US in six to eight
weeks, a senior Pakistani official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The total value of the released equipment is about 368 million
US dollars," Pakistani Foreign Office Secretary Najmuddin Sheikh
told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan had placed orders for a large number of US-made
weapons and made payments for them in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
However, the US had refused to either provide the weapons or
return the money since 1990 when the US Congress adopted the
Pressler Amendment calling for stopping US military aid for
countries suspected to be making nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Last October, the US Congress passed the Brown Amendment that
offered to return all the embargoed military items to Pakistan
except the dozens of F-16 jet fighters.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh said the US Congress had decided a few days ago to start
returning the weapons.
</P>
<P>
As the equipment would undergo inspection by experts and need
packaging or repackaging before its shipment, Pakistan would start
receiving the equipment in six to eight weeks, he added.
</P>
<P>
"About 191 million dollars of equipment is for the Navy, which
includes three aircraft for anti-submarine and surveillance,
missiles and other items," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"About 98.8 million dollars of equipment is for the Air Force,
which includes missiles, while about 77.4 million dollars of
equipment is for the Army, which includes rockets and rocket
launchers," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The US will also refund 124 million dollars in cash," he said,
adding that "this is our money that was paid for the equipment
diverted to other uses no longer needed for the F-16 program."
</P>
<P>
"The F-16 issue is still under discussion," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our position is that we should either get the planes or the
money back in full," Sheikh stressed.

MANILA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today hailed the first Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) in Bangkok on
March 1-2 as a milestone in Asia-Europe relations, which provided
a mechanism for increased synergy between the two continents.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark while meeting with 12 chiefs of the mission
of the European Union (EU) to the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said ASEM has given a strong impetus to the concept of
open regionalism and has "expanded the dimension of our ties, thus
complementing our bilateral and ASEAN-EU cooperative endeavors."
</P>
<P>
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) comprises
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand
and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
He said ASEM could create its own framework for trade and
investment liberalization and facilitation.
</P>
<P>
It can also provide the vehicle for private sector cooperation,
nurture cooperation in regional growth areas and foster
intensified cooperation in human resources development, the
promotion of science and technology crossflows, said Ramos.

General Rashid Dostum go to New York and show up at the debate.
</P>
<P>
"He was there on his own," he said, adding that Dostum was not
a guest of Pakistan.
</P>

"Pakistan has no favorites in Afghanistan," he said, stressing
that Pakistan would help bring all Afghan factions together to
find a peaceful solution to the crisis.

<HEADLINE> Major Expresses Confidence in Ulster Peace After Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
said today that the Northern Ireland peace process will not be
derailed by the Irish Republican Army (IRA).
</P>
<P>
Major, who is visiting the Czech Republic, made the remarks in
response to a suspected IRA blast Wednesday, reported BBC this
morning.
</P>
<P>
The blast, causing no casualties, occurred in a residential
area in the west of London at 9:45 p.m. (2045 GMT) after a news
agency received a coded warning that the police said linked it to
the IRA.
</P>
<P>
The IRA was thumbing its nose at the democratic process but
will not be able to stop it, said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Major repeated that the IRA's political wing Sinn Fein would
not take part in the planned all-party talks on the future of
Northern Ireland to be convened on June 10 until there was a firm
ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
However, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams pledged again that his
party was still "totally committed" to its peace strategy and a
resolution to the Ulster conflict, despite last night's bomb
explosion.
</P>
<P>
Adams said that if Major was serious about peace he must assure
sceptics that the proposed peace forum which would be produced in
the elections on May 30 would lead to "proper and substantive
negotiations" on the future of Ulster.
</P>
<P>
The process must be within a set time-frame and contain "no
actual or potential stalling devices," Adams stressed.

<P>
Phan Van Tiem, minister in Charge of the Committee for
Renovation of Enterprises, noted that the stock company system is
vital to the revitalization and restructuring of state-run
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He said that there are currently 6,000 state-run enterprises in
Vietnam and it is essential to maintain their leading role in the
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
"The state-owned enterprises that cannot be merged into bigger
conglomerates and those on the verge of bankruptcy will be
eligible for equatization," he added.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the new stock company system is aimed at
expanding capital resources, creating new dynamics, preventing
negative elements in business and making state-run enterprises
more efficient.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the equities will be sold to
employees of the enterprise, other people and legal entities
outside it and in some cases, to foreign individuals and firms, so
as to attract more funds for development.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, the equities of merely eight small and medium-sized
enterprises in Vietnam have been sold to share holders. Only five
of them have started operation as legal joint-stock entities due
to differences over the new practice.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that the experience in the implementation
of the stock company system in about 1.5-2 percent of Vietnam's
state-run enterprises would make it possible to work out a draft
law by the end of 2007, which could provide a firm legal base for
expanding the new system to more state-run firms in the future.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Phone Firm Unveils Expansion Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Long Distance
Telephone Company (PLTD), the country's telecom giant, plans to
invest 3.4 billion US dollars to expand its network in the next
six years, PLTD President Antonio Cojuangco said today.
</P>
<P>
By upgrading the network's infrastructure, the company can
support advanced intelligent network services and broadband
capabilities as well as integrate voice and video on data to cater
to business and residential customers, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Cojuangco, these initiatives will ensure higher
network availability, improve service reliability and sound
quality, and reduce line trouble and maintenance costs.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, the PLDT will have 3 million digital lines in
services, linked together by 100 percent fiber optic trunking
facilities, he said.
</P>
<P>
The company's assets totalled 103.4 billion pesos (4.136
billion US dollars) last year, exceeding the 100-billion-peso (4
billion US dollars) mark and up by 20.7 billion pesos (828 million
US dollars) from the 1994 level.
</P>
<P>
Cojuangco attributed the increase to the growth of property,
plants and equipment, which registered the highest asset growth of
162 billion pesos (6.48 billion US dollars) as the company's zero
backlog project proceeded on course.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria to Resume Building Second Nuclear Power Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria is to resume the
construction of its second nuclear power plant in 1997, local news
report said today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Trud (Labor) quoted Konstantin Rusinov, chairman
of the Bulgarian Energy Committee, as saying on Wednesday that
Bulgaria has raised the necessary funds to resume the construction
of the Belene nuclear power plant whose first reactor is expected
to start generating electricity in 2004.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the Belene nuclear power plant got underway
in the early 1980s, but the lack of money forced the construction
to halt with only 40 percent of the construction work finished.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that the Belene nuclear power plant has
acquired 60 percent of its equipment while the state has spent 1.3
billion U.S. dollars on the construction of the power plant.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria relies heavily on nuclear energy. Around half of the
country's annual electric energy production of 34 billion
kilowatt-hours comes from its nuclear power plant at Kozloduy.

<HEADLINE> China Protects Motorola TradeMarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Motorola's Senior Vice President
and Motorola Director of Patents, Trademarks and Licensing James
W. Gillman expressed thanks today for the effective protection
rendered by the Chinese government to Motorola trademarks
registered in China.
</P>
<P>
Gillman, who is on a business trip here, made a special visit
to the Trademark Office of the State Administration for Industry
and Commerce of China (SAIC) to show his gratitude.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that in 1995 after discovering infringements of
Motorola trademarks in China, the US telecommunications giant
asked its trademark agent in Beijing to file a complaint with the
SAIC.
</P>
<P>
Through careful investigations SAIC uncovered dozens of such
infringement cases in Beijing, Guangdong, Zhejiang, and
Jiangsu. To date, the majority of the cases have been settled.
</P>
<P>
In addition, SAIC bureaux in Shanghai municipality and the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region took the initiative to crack down
upon Motorola trademark violations.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown on these counterfeit trademarks and products,
including batteries, battery chargers, and pager accessories has
showed the ability of the Chinese trademark authorities to render
good protection for registered trademarks, said Gillman.
</P>
<P>
Counterfeit trademarks and the manufacturing and selling of
counterfeit-trademark products are harmful to both the trademark
owners and consumers, Gillman pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Still he is confident, he said, about China's protection work
and optimistic about the economic development prospects of
China. His corporation will continue to register trademarks as
well as invest in China, he said.

countries in south-eastern Asia which sought technology from the
developed world, improved on it to suit their own environment to
develop their small economies.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot compete with countries like the United States of
America, but we can choose a niche where we can excel and be able
to define it in terms of manpower and finance," he stressed.

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official: Disputes Should be Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese delegate attending the
95th Inter-Parliamentary Conference said here today that all
countries should settle their disputes peacefully through
negotiations and consultations, instead of resorting to threat or
use of force.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Jue, Vice Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of
the National People's Congress (NPC) of China, made the remarks
at a debate of the 5-day conference, which opened here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said: "The world is still under complicated and profound
changes. The overall situation is moving toward relaxation."
</P>
<P>
"Multipolarization is gaining momentum, and a new world
pattern is taking shape," Zhou noted. "It has become the major
theme of our world today to secure world peace, national
stability, economic development and human progress."
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the world is still plagued by many
problems such as hegemonism and power politics. Destabilizing and
unpredictable factors in the international situation still
remain, he added.
</P>
<P>
The unfair and unreasonable international political and
economic order is yet to be changed, he said, referring to the
ever-increasing gap between the North and South.
</P>
<P>
"Internal affairs of a country should be handled by its own
people, while major international issues should be settled
through consultations on an equal footing and on the basis of
mutual respect," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that no country has the special right to interfere
with the internal affairs of their countries or to impose its own
will upon others.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese official charged some big countries with using
"freedom," "democracy'" and "human rights" as a cover to impose
its own social system, ideology and values upon others, saying
that this practice encroaches upon their sovereignty, interferes
in their domestic affairs, undermines their unity and ethnic
harmony.
</P>
<P>
"These acts of hegemonism go against the trend of history and
run counter to the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter,"
Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the irrational international economic
order is a major cause of poverty and backwardness in many
developing countries, adding that the developed countries should
support and help the developing countries to revitalize their
economy and improve their living standards by providing capital,
debt reduction and exemption, technology transfer and market
access.
</P>
<P>
This is also in the long-term interest of the developed
countries themselves, Zhou said.

<HEADLINE> Boat From Liberia Refused Landing In S.Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, April 19 (Xinhua) -- A boat ship from Liberia will
leave Freetown later today for Lagos after refused disembarkation
rights, diplomatic sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The Bolcki Challenger, with about 541 passengers onboard, is
now offloading cargo bound for Freetown at the quay.
</P>
<P>
Most of the passengers claim to be Nigerian "traders", who
were earlier refused landing in Monrovia but "picked up some
evacuees for Lagos," an official of the vessel said.
</P>
<P>
"When we got to Freetown, many of the passengers wanted to
disembark but were refused entry by the Sierra Leone
authorities," he added.
</P>
<P>
Port officials said the decision not to allow the boat to land
stemmed from an order from State House. The order is being
enforced by both the military and the police.
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious that the government, recalling previous entry
by Liberians into Sierra Leone, is now wary of any one entering
from Liberia," according to one Sierra Leonean port official.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, another vessel, the Victory Reefer, was allowed
to land with some 800 passengers onboard, mainly members of the
UN Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL).
</P>
<P>
Nationalities from Pakistan, India, the Czech Repurblic,
Lebanon, Ghana were also brought in together with a number of
Sierra Leone soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Many of the Lebanese looked distressed and weak with three of
them given urgent medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
An arriving official of UNOMIL said the situation in Monrovia
"is far from normal and remains precarious."
</P>
<P>
Colonel Shak Zak said in an interview that no UN staff had been
injured in the escalation of violence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lebanese Ambassador in Sierra Leone Mohamad El-Dib
said about 500 Lebanese nationals so far have been evacuated to
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
He said the evacuation was made possible through the joint
effort of the Sierra Leone navy and the United Nations and that

<HEADLINE> Macao Residents Choose More Fresh Beef Than Frozen One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Macao residents have begun to
choose more fresh beef in recent days instead of frozen one as a
result of the fear of possible "mad cow disease," a report says.
</P>
<P>
Today's "Tai Chung Pou" newspaper reported that the Macao
Butchery House has increased supply of fresh beef following the
rise of demand in recent days because many people are afraid of
eating imported frozen beef.
</P>
<P>
An executive of the Macao Butchery House was quoted as saying
that the house now slaughters about 20 heads of cattles each day
to meet increasing demand.
</P>
<P>
In the past, most customers like to choose imported beef for
its better quality. But that trend stopped in recent days because
of fear of the "mad cow disease".
</P>
<P>
Macao began to ban import of British beef, mutton and related
products earlier this month.

Most of the passengers from Macao to Shanghai are from Taiwan,
who are going to Shanghai via Macao on business or seeing their
relatives. The seat occupation rate has reached 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurated last November, the Macao International Airport has
now started flights to a dozen destinations in China's mainland and
other parts of the world. Air Macao now has daily flights to
Beijing, Shanghai, Xiamen, Taipei and Kaohsiung.
</P>
<P>
Seat occupation rate in most of the flights are quite low, and
some air companies flying to Macao have even canceled flights due to
shortage of passengers, the report says.
</P>
<P>
However, the quasi-direct flight between Taiwan and Shanghai
via Macao has been doing boom business due to its cheaper price
and faster service compared with flights via Hong Kong.

highest figure so far in the country indicated that Nigerians
accepted the three-year government transition program.
</P>
<P>
A national Council meeting, presided by the Head of State

the National Electoral Commission of Nigeria (NECON) on effective
preparation for future elections, local press reports said today.
</P>

"As you are aware, the local government elections is part of
the transition program of the government and because of the large
turn-out of voters, the arragement by NECON was overstretched and
the administrators came in to assist," he said.

NECON Chairman, Chief Sumner Dagogo-Jack had earlier briefed
members of the council on the commission's activities during the
elections and preparations for the forthcoming council polls on
party basis.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Hu Jintao, a member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central
Committee, met here today with Christophe Moukoueke, general
secretary of the Pan-African Union for Social Democracy (PAUSD) of
the Congo.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting at the Great Hall of the People, Hu extended
a welcome to Moukoueke, who is heading the first delegation of his
party to China. This visit, Hu said, marks the "official
establishment of friendly relations between our two parties."
</P>
<P>
The PAUSD, founded in 1991, is the ruling party of the Congo.
Hu said that China highly evaluates the efforts of the Congolese
people in safeguarding national independence and state
sovereignty, realizing domestic stability and reviving its
national economy, under the leadership of President Pascal
Lissouba and the PAUSD.
</P>
<P>
"We also appreciate the 'one China' stand long held by the
Congolese government," Hu added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the CPC and the Chinese government have always
regarded African countries as reliable friends. Further
consolidating and strengthening solidarity and co-operation with
them is an important part of China's foreign policy; and
developing exchanges and co-operation with their political parties
on the basis of the four principles governing inter-party
relations remains the long-term policy of the Communist Party of
China, Hu emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed the guests on the situation of China's national
economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
Moukoueke thanked Hu for the meeting. He said the Congo and
China have kept friendly co-operative ties since the establishment
of diplomatic relations in 1964. President Lissouba's visit to
China in 1994 heralded a new era of bilateral relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries have similar or identical views on
many international issues, and the Congolese government
appreciates China's reform and opening-up policy and sticks to the
stance of "one China".

recent years.
</P>
<P>
MENA said the terrorist attack, which targeted tourists in
Europa Hotel on the Pyramid Road, took place when a Polish tourist
group was entering the hotel and a Greek tourist group was leaving.
</P>
<P>
The tourists came under fire when they were getting out of the
lobby of the hotel. An eyewitness said that four gunmen reached
the hotel in a Volkswagen microbus, and three of them headed for
the entrance of the hotel and raked the tourists with a volley of
automatic gunfire.

Gamal Mahmoud Hussein, a bus driver, said that one gunman with
a pistol stood across from the hotel while three others with
automatic rifles opened fire on the tourist groups going in and
out of the hotel.
</P>
<P>
"I tried to chase after them when they were getting into a
microbus, but one of the terrorists starting aiming his weapon at
me so I had to stop. They got away," MENA quoted him as saying.
</P>

Witnesses said the front of the hotel was riddled with bullet
holes and some glass windows of taxis in front of the building
were shattered.
</P>

Islamic militants launched a campaign trying to unseat the
incumbent secular government and replace it with a more strict
Islamic rule. More than 900 people have been killed in the
violence, mostly police and militants.

NEW DELHI, April 18 (Xinhua) -- India's Defense Research and

Under the 10-year plan, India would develop at least 70 percent

off the shelf, said the sources.

They said it had become extremely difficult to procure crucial
technologies from foreign countries with so many control regimes

In addition, nobody gives the latest technology, the sources

<P>
An opportunity arose in 1986, when he was chosen by the
Ministry of Culture as the sole candidate to go to Mauritius for a
two-year cultural exchange project.
</P>
<P>
On arriving in that African country, however, he found that all
the ethnic groups living there except the Chinese had formed their
own folk music bands. There was no way by which the African people
could become familiar with Chinese traditional music.
</P>
<P>
But within two years he had founded a school specializing in
teaching Chinese folk music, the first ever set up throughout the
African continent. For most of the time he was the only staff
member of it.
</P>
<P>
"Usually I had to teach 30 classes a week covering the
performance of all Chinese traditional musical instruments, as
well as some musical fundamentals. It was also a great challenge
for me to get a good command of French, which was vital to my
teaching," Zhu recalled.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 successful concerts had been held by Zhu's
students before their graduation in June 1988, with first-class
performance of famous ancient Chinese melodies. A local newspaper
hailed the performances as marking the "birth of a good Chinese
music band in Mauritius."
</P>
<P>
With a Certificate of Merit granted by the Mauritian
government, Zhu returned home with an even greater ambition.
</P>
<P>
"I will seize every opportunity to spread our splendid folk
music to every corner of the world and enable more people to enjoy
its beauty," he said. "I wish to have more foreign students."
</P>
<P>
Now he is neither in good health nor well off. He lives with
his family in a small room. "I have saved nothing but some
compositions of folk music throughout my life," he said.
</P>
<P>
But his American student said sincerely: "I admire Zhu more
than anyone else."

<HEADLINE> ROK Company to Invest in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Lucky-Goldstar Group (LG) of
the Republic of Korea (ROK) plans to invest six billion US dollars
in China in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
"China will become the No.1 place for LG to carry out its
business in the 21st century, and we have designated China,
including Hong Kong and Taiwan, as the most important region for
our business development," Jin-Hwan Chun, president of the
executive office for China of the LG Group, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Sino-ROK economic and trade seminar, Chun said
the funds will go into the construction of a large petrochemical
complex, semi-conductor, telecommunications, electronics,
transportation and power facilities as well as banking and real
estate.
</P>
<P>
The president said that LG is interested in being empowered to
contract for running a money-losing Chinese enterprise with its
advantage in management.
</P>
<P>
"We will strive to turn it into one of China's first-class
profitable enterprises within three to five years," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Chun, China's market-oriented reform has made the
country full of hope and attractive to investors. The country is
provided with a vast market potential and rich natural resources,
and its investment conditions are improving.
</P>
<P>
The third-largest consortium in the ROK, LG has developed more
than 20 projects in China, involving a total investment of 700
million US dollars, since 1988. It has ten sub-companies and over
20 representative offices in China at present. Its trade volume
with China was worth more than one billion US dollars last year.

was employed by BTV, and now he, together with his Chinese
partners, is producing a series to introduce Russia's history,
cultural traditions and current situation to Chinese audiences.

"I am happy to have such an opportunity to continue
contributing to the friendship between the two peoples," Kulikov

"The national economy got off to a good start this year, with
an overall economic balance and stable pricing situation," said

"It might accomplish the goal of a 'soft landing'
economically," he said.
</P>
<P>
China has set its economic growth rate this year at eight
percent, the inflation rate within ten percent and the rate of
investment in fixed assets at 32 percent.

The latest statistics show that the industrial added value
amounted to 422.2 billion yuan in the first quarter of this year,
up 13.6 percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Zhou attributed the good result to the steady growth of state
enterprises and the rapid development of non-governmental
industries as well as the orientation of industrial products in
line with the market needs.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that major problems remain in industrial
operations, which include a drop in the sales rate and low

<HEADLINE> 122 HIV-Infected Persons Found in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A total of 122 cases of
HIV-infection have been found in the Chinese capital since 1985,
showing a sign of increase in the AIDs-related condition.
</P>
<P>
The "Beijing Evening News" reported Wednesday that the
municipal government vowed to tighten supervision over the killer
disease, following the discovery of the first such case in Beijing
in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Among the 122 cases, 51 involve foreigners, 41 transient people
and 30 local residents, according to the local public health
bureau.
</P>
<P>
As for the 30 local residents, 12 developed full-blown AIDs and
seven have died.
</P>
<P>
Observers noticed that before 1989 all the HIV cases were
foreigners or outsiders. In 1989 the first such case was found
involving a local resident.
</P>
<P>
Between 1989 and 1992 local HIV carriers were all people who
had left the country for various purposes.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992 the HIV carriers have been VD patients, homosexual
or bi-sexual people, or frequenters of prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that there are 50,000 to 100,000 people in
China who have tested HIV-positive. There are 19.5 million
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
And VD has replaced scarlet fever to rank in third place among
the infectious diseases in the capital, which has a transient
population of three million.

<HEADLINE> China to Continue to Play Constructive Role for Peace in Korean Peninsula: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman said here today that China will continue to play a
constructive role in maintaining peace and stability in the Korean
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The Spokesman Shen Guofang made the remark here this afternoon
at a press conference when asked about China's position on the
establishment of a new peace mechanism in the Korean Peninsula and
whether China is going to take part in the four-party negotiations
proposed by the US and the Republic of Korea (ROK).
</P>
<P>
Shen said, "We understand the desire of the parties concerned
including the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) for the
establishment of a peace mechanism of the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, we have taken note of the ROK-US proposal for a
four-party peace process. In our view, it would serve peace and
stability in the Peninsula if the existing armistice agreement
would be replaced by a peace mechanism in keeping with the
development of situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that there are differences, though, between the
DPRK and the ROK-US on the modality of negotiations on the
Peninsula peace regime and the scope of participation.
</P>
<P>
"It is therefore our hope that a consensus will be reached
through consultations", Shen said, stressing that China will
continue to play a constructive role in maintaining peace and
stability in the Peninsula.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Folk Musician and His Foreign Students (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, April 18 (Xinhua Correspondent Fang Yibo) -- In China
today most people are no longer surprised to see foreigners
walking in the streets. But probably they would still be surprised
at the sight of a foreigner with an erhu or a zheng (traditional
Chinese instruments) on his back.
</P>
<P>
In an alley in this picturesque capital city of east China's
Zhejiang Province, almost every day such a foreigner can be
sighted.
</P>
<P>
This young American, Chris Ewing, who has given himself the
rather exotic Chinese name of Ke Lishi, frequents the alley where
his teacher of Chinese folk music, Zhu Liangkai, lives.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, 55, is now a composer and performer of Chinese folk music
at the Zhejiang Provincial Song and Dance Troupe.
</P>
<P>
After his graduation from the Music Composition Department of
Iowa State University, Ewing, who has always been eager to learn
Chinese folk music, was introduced to Zhu, who helped him to come
to Hangzhou and promised to teach him free of charge.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also recommended his self-supported young student to a
local college as an English teacher, and often invites him to
family dinners on holidays or during festivals.
</P>
<P>
After great efforts, Ewing is now able to play the erhu fairly
well. He has even composed an erhu melody titled "For My
Grandfather", in memory of his grandfather, who passed away last
year.
</P>
<P>
However, he is neither the only nor the first foreign student
Zhu has ever taught.
</P>
<P>
Zhu has been fascinated by China's legacy of folk music since
his childhood. He became the youngest student in the folk music
class of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music at the age of 14.
</P>
<P>
During his decades of work with the Song and Dance Troupe he
has composed over 30 melodies, most of which are popular all over
the country. But he has never felt contented with his own
achievements.
</P>
<P>
"Why are symphonies composed by famous Western musicians like
Beethoven, instead of famous Chinese folk music tunes such as
"Lofty Mountain and Flowing Water", always the names that come
first into people's minds at the mention of music?" was a question
that puzzled him for a long time.
</P>
<P>
The answer he found is that little work has been done in
popularizing China's folk music. Thus he was determined to do all
he could to let more people, especially people from the rest of
the world, know something about it.

<HEADLINE> Famous Scholar Back in the Public Eye Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua)-- A famous modern Chinese scholar,
Chen Yinque, has caught the eye of academics again after having
been forgotten for nearly 30 years.
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen scholars took part in a forum on the man who
left his mark in Chinese history, religion, linguistics, and
classical literature.
</P>
<P>
They came to Beijing's Fengrusong Bookstore at Beijing
University to pay their respects to the so-called "patriotic
scholar" and his ideas, and to discuss a recently published book
"The Last 20 Years of Chen Yinque".
</P>
<P>
Chen Yinque (1890-1969) was listed as one of the "Three Masters
of Chinese Scholarship", along with Wang Guowei and Zhang Binglin.
</P>
<P>
He studied the social sciences in the US, Europe and Japan in
his early years, returning to China in 1925 to teach in several
universities.
</P>
<P>
Chen decided not to leave on the eve of Chinese Liberation
(1949) and stayed to continue his research work on history and
linguistics.
</P>
<P>
He died of a heart attack brought on partly by ill treatment
during the disastrous political turmoil of the Cultural Revolution
(1966-76).
</P>
<P>
His monograph "A Thesis on the Origin of the Sui and Tang
Dynasty Institutions" and "A Thesis on the Tang Dynasty's
Political History" were hailed as "milestones of research on Sui
and Tang dynasty history."
</P>
<P>
A former asisstant of his, Deng Guangming, now a professor at
Beijing University, cites Chen as a model for researchers.
</P>
<P>
Ji Xianlin, a prominent scholar among Chinese translators, says
that recovering Chen's learned ideas will no doubt improve Chinese
research both in a material and in a spiritual way.
</P>
<P>
A trend to study traditional culture can now be seen all over
the country, says an expert from the Chinese Literature and Art
Academy. One scholar, Liu Mengxi, who has been deeply involved in
studying Chen's thought for nearly 10 years, says that there are
now a group of scholars participating in the research.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll of Hotel Killing Rises to 18 in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The death toll of a terrorist
attack at a Cairo hotel this morning rose to 18, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency (MENA) said.
</P>
<P>
Of the killed 13 were women, MENA said. The killing was carried
out by four gunmen suspected to be Islamic militants in Europe
Hotel near the renowned Pyramids, and the killed were mostly Greek
tourists, including an Egyptian who worked in the hotel's garage.
</P>
<P>
Previous reports said that 17 tourists were shot to death and
20 people wounded by the assailants in the terrorist
attack. Interior Minister Hassan el-Alfy, who is in charge of
Egypt's police, visited the hotel and listened to a report on the
incident.
</P>
<P>
This was the most serious incident of violence in Egypt in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
MENA said "the terrorist attack,' which targeted tourists in
Europa Hotel on the Pyramid Road, took place when a Polish tourist
group was entering the hotel and a Greek tourist group was leaving.
</P>
<P>
The tourists came under fire when they were getting out of the
lobby of the hotel. An eyewitness said that four gunmen reached
the hotel in a Volkswagen microbus, and three of them headed for
the entrance of the hotel and raked the tourists with a volley of
automatic gunfire.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen fled the scene immediately after the attack, the
witness said.
</P>
<P>
Gamal Mahmoud Hussein, a bus driver, said that one gunman with
a pistol stood across from the hotel while three others with
automatic rifles opened fire on the tourist groups going in and
out of the hotel.
</P>
<P>
"I tried to chase after them when they were getting into a
microbus, but one of the terrorists starting aiming his weapon at
me so I had to stop. They got away," MENA quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the front of the hotel was riddled with bullet
holes and some glass windows of taxis in front of the building
were shattered.
</P>
<P>
The four attackers were seen wearing black clothes when
carrying out the attack.
</P>
<P>
Violence has plagued Egypt since 1992 when the country's
Islamic militants launched a campaign trying to unseat the
incumbent secular government and replace it with a more strict
Islamic rule. More than 900 people have been killed in the
violence, mostly police and militants.

<HEADLINE> Two Candidates for 10th Panchen Lama Doing well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Two boys who were not picked in
last year's drawing of lots for the reincarnation of the 10th
Panchen Lama have assumed new positions in Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
One of them, Ngawang Nanzui, has been confirmed as the
reincarnation of the Qiongbo Living Buddha, a renowned living
Buddha in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The other boy, Guizong Wangdui, is being trained at the Zhaxi
Lhunbo Lamasery as a scripture hall living Buddha.
</P>
<P>
Puncog, director of the Academy of Social Sciences of the Tibet
Autonomous Region and a Tibetan expert on sociology and history,
said, "According to historical conventions and religious rituals,
boys who are not chosen from the drawing of lots for Dalai Lama or
Panchen Lama will assume a high position in the religion.
</P>
<P>
"As a rule, they become scripture hall living Buddhas in
well-known monasteries such as Zhebung, Sera, Gandain, or Zhaxi
Lhunbo."
</P>
<P>
Soon after last year's lot-drawing ceremony, Ngawang Nanzui was
recognized as the reincarnation of the Qiongbo Living Buddha,
under the guidance of a renowned living Buddha in Labrang
Monastery, the biggest Tibetan monastery in Gansu Province. He has
been confirmed by the Zhaxijiangbai Monastery in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
After the Qiongbo Living Buddha passed away in January 1990 at
the age of 73, the Zhaxijiangbai Monastery searched everywhere for
the boy for five years until Ngawang Nanzui was recognized as his
reincarnation this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Luozui, abbot of the Zhaxijiangbai Monastery, 90
miles north of Xigaze, the monastery will choose an auspicious day
later this year for Ngawang Nanzui to ascend the holy throne,
after he is confirmed as the third Qiongbo Living Buddha by the
Chinese central government.
</P>
<P>
Gaqi Zadure, who has the highest academic degree in Tibetan
Buddhism, is Guizong Wangdui's canon teacher in the Zhaxi Lhunbo
Monastery. He said, "Guizong Wangdui devotes himself to his
studies."
</P>
<P>
Besides reciting sutras, Guizong Wangdui has time to study the
Tibetan language and participate in recreational activities
everyday.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Private Business Tax Revenues Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Tax revenues from
privately-owned businesses in China's largest industrial center
registered a 208 percent rise, reaching 275 million yuan, in the
first quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
The sharp increase was ascribed to a series of preferential
policies encouraging privately-owned businesses in the past year,
said a municipal commercial official. There were 1,600 private
companies started each month during the past year, with their
numbers climbing to 32,400 so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Improved controls on taxation also contributed to the increased
revenues, the official explained. In the latter half of 1995,
local tax departments made the tax code more uniform for industry
and commerce, the food business, advertising, and the building
industry.
</P>
<P>
To stop tax evasion, they launched a citywide investigation of
private businesses several times during the year.

and Commerce show there were 48,000 advertising companies across
the country in 1995, as against 43,000 in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
An official with administration said that the Chinese market
has great potential yet to be tapped, so an increasing number of
world-renowned advertising firms started probing the country from
1992 as a result.
</P>
<P>
According to law, foreign businessmen are not allowed to launch
exclusively-owned advertising companies in China.
</P>
<P>
Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi Advertising Worldwide, a world-renowned
British advertising heavyweight launched a joint venture with the
China Great Wall Industry Corporation in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The company capped its local counterparts by scoring a business
volume of 380 million yuan (about 46.34 million US dollars)-worth
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Experts here believe that the involvement of foreign firms is
conducive to the development of the Chinese advertising industry.

<HEADLINE> Optical Cable Market Growing in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- China's fledgling optical fiber
market is experiencing amazing growth and extraordinary demand for
seven million fibers in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
He Feichang, director of the system and equipment department of
the ministry of electronics industry, said in an article in "China
Electronics News" that the fibers will be used for 280,000 km of
optical cables, including 35,000 km for trunk projects, 90,000 km
for local telephone networks, and 10,000 km for submarine cables.
</P>
<P>
The director said that the country's demand for SDH
(synchronous digital hierarchy), one of the most sophisticated
optical transmission systems in the world, will grow constantly
over the next five years, with all telecom trunks improving their
speed to 622 Mb/s or 2.5 Gb/s.
</P>
<P>
China's production capacity of optical cable will be 140,000 km
per year, with some 80 optical cable plants and 70 producing lines
having been established in the past few years, so supply will
outstrip demand by the end of the century, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, 85 per cent of the optical fiber of
cables produced in China is imported, and China's production
capacity of optical electronic components is far below demand on
the domestic market.

<HEADLINE> 17 Killed in Hotel Attack Near Pyramids in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 18 (Xinhua) -- At least 17 people were killed by
suspected Islamic militants in a hotel near the renowned Pyramids
this morning.
</P>
<P>
The 17, many of them Greek tourists, were shot to death by the
assailants, Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA) said.
</P>
<P>
MENA said "the terrorist attack,' which targeted tourists in
Europa Hotel on the Pyramid Road, took place when a Polish tourist
group was entering the hotel and a Greek tourist group was leaving.
</P>
<P>
The tourists came under fire when they were getting out of the
lobby of the hotel.
</P>
<P>
An eyewitness said that four gunmen reached the hotel in a Volkswagen
microbus, and three of them headed for the entrance of the hotel
and raked the tourists with a volley of automatic gunfire.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen fled the scene immediately after the attack, the
witness said.
</P>
<P>
At least 20 people were wounded, MENA said. Interior Minister
Hassan el-Alfy visited the hotel and listened to a report on the
incident.
</P>
<P>
Gamal Mahmoud Hussein, a bus driver, said that one gunman with
a pistol stood across from the hotel while three others with
automatic rifles opened fire on the tourist groups going in and
out of the hotel.
</P>
<P>
"I tried to chase after them when they were getting into a
microbus, but one of the terrorists starting aiming his weapon at
me so I had to stop. They got away," MENA quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the front of the hotel was riddled with bullet
holes and some glass windows of taxis in front of the building
were shattered.
</P>
<P>
The four attackers were seen wearing black when carrying out
the attack.
</P>
<P>
Violence has plagued Egypt since 1992 when the country's
Islamic militants launched a campaign trying to unseat the
incumbent secular government and replace it with a more strict
Islamic rule. More than 900 people have been killed in the
violence, mostly police and militants.

<HEADLINE> Uganda-Zaire Border Closed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has ordered the closure
of the Uganda-Zaire border following recent clashes between the
Ugandan government forces and the Sudanese army and rebels of the
West Nile Bank Front (WNBF).
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here today, units of the Uganda
People's Defense Forces (UPDF) are making serious patrols on all
border entry points to prevent any crossing.
</P>
<P>
James Kazini, a UPDF commander was quoted as saying, "We are
disturbed to learn that the Zaire territory was intensively used
in the abortive plan to invade Uganda."
</P>
<P>
Kazini said that a ballistic missile BM-21 placed by Sudanese
troops shelled Ugandan territory from the Zairean area of Kangezi
on April 7 with three bombs falling on meters from the Uganda's
Koboko army barracks,though no deaths or loss of property was
reported.
</P>
<P>
On April 9, UPDF made a retaliation fighting lasting for six
hours and the Sudanese soldiers ran in disarray after their
weapons were totally destroyed.
</P>
<P>
According to army sources here, the April 7 shelling is the
third failure by the Sudanese army in its attempt to invade
Uganda together with the rebels of Lord Resistance Army and the
WNBF.
</P>
<P>
The sources said they worried that Zairean soldiers supported
the WNBF rebels.
</P>
<P>
Although the Zairean government does not support the
WNBF rebels, some indisciplined Zairean soldiers often in
Sudanese army uniforms have supported the rebels, the sources
said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Frowns at French Mediation over Lebanese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, APRIL 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior Israeli official
has accused France of trying to upstage the United States in
the Middle East, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed official told the radio Wednesday night that he
believes French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette has extended
his shuttle in the Middle East, to take the advantage of
the fact that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher
had been busy elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Christopher is currently in Tokyo accompanying President
Clinton in his three-day visit to Japan. Clinton said Wednesday
that his secretary of state is holding contacts by phone in an
attempt to solve the Israel-Hezbollah conflict.
</P>
<P>
The French foreign minister is due to meet with Prime
minister Shimon Peres this morning. This will be his third
visit to Israel this week.
</P>
<P>
De Charette will arrive from Cairo where he held talks with
Egyptian leaders. Earlier Wednesday morning, de Charette met in
Tel Aviv with his Israeli counterpart Ehud Barak on a French
proposal to end the fighting in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for de Charette called the meeting "useful and
difficult." It was reported that de Charette told Barak that both
Syria and Lebanon have accepted the plan, and Iran also indicated
that it was acceptable.
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with de Charette, Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouk Shara told reporters in Cairo Wednesday night that the
French proposal has some positive elements.
</P>
<P>
Shara said that Syria had added some ideas to the French
proposal which will help calm down the situation. But there is no
reaction from Israel so far, he added.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri declared that he prefers
the French proposal to the U.S. one. He made the statement in
London Wednesday night after talks with British Prime Minister
John Major.
</P>
<P>
However, Hariri said that both proposals have good and bad
points and they should be merged. He hoped that France and
the U.S. will pool their diplomatic efforts to present a joint
proposal for a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
According to Hariri, Presidents Chirac and Clinton have already
made close contacts and will cooperate to end the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The radio reported that Washington is expecting response from
Syria to its proposal to end the fighting in Lebanon. Sources in
the U.S. capital hinted that the U.S. government is not happy
over what they called French diplomatic intervention, and it also
has reservations about Paris's ties with Iran.

<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Work began on two optical cable
projects in Jiangsu Province for two sophisticated telecom
systems, one along the Yangtze River, the other along the east
coast.
</P>
<P>
The cable along the river will start in Shanghai, China's
leading industrial municipality, and run through Jiangsu, Anhui
and Hubei provinces, for 1,490 km.
</P>
<P>
The Jiangsu section of the cable will be 535 km long, and use
the most advanced optical transmission equipment in the world. It
will provide more than 100,000 long-distance telephone lines in
the initial stage, the "People's Post and Telecommunications
Daily" said.
</P>
<P>
The 1,209-km coastal cable will connect Shanghai with Dalian, a
harbor city in northeast China, via Qingdao, Lianyungang,
Yancheng, Nantong, and Jingjiang cities. It will run for 525 km in
Jiangsu, linking 16 counties and cities.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Liaoning's Detergent Trade Set for Clean Sweep </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A clean sweep is expected to
turn northeast China's Liaoning Province into one of China's
biggest detergent makers.
</P>
<P>
Provincial officials have drawn up a formula to turn the area
into one of the biggest production bases for chemical fibers,
ethylene and detergent by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Wen Shizhen, governor of the province,
adding that deep-processing of raw materials will give impetus to
rapid development of provincial township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
A traditional industrial base in China, the province has ten
percent of the country's large- and medium-sized state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In addition to state-owned enterprises, the province will
attach more importance to township enterprises, with plans to
invest 70 billion yuan in improving them during the coming five
years.
</P>
<P>
It plans to lift annual output value of all township
enterprises to 800 billion yuan at the turn of the century, with
annual growth rate reaching 20 percent during the 1996-2000
period, and as much as 2,000 billion yuan in 2010.
</P>
<P>
Output value of the province's township enterprises accounted
for more than one-third of the local total last year.
</P>
<P>
The township enterprises will place more emphasis on processing
farm products as well as energy, raw material, building materials,
machinery, textile, electronics and chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Greater efforts will also be made to improve the
export-oriented economy, in a bid to lift export goods value from
18 billion yuan in 1995 to 60 billion yuan by the turn of the
century.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- China is capable of realizing its
foreign trade objectives for this year, although it suffered a
trade slump in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
This remark was made by Hu Zhaoqing, spokesman for the Ministry
of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (MOFTEC), here today.
</P>
<P>
China plans to realize a foreign trade volume of 281 billion US
dollars-worth this year.
</P>
<P>
Exports amounted to 28.2 billion US dollars-worth in the first
quarter of this year, 8.7 percent less than in the same period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
The export reduction was expected since many Chinese businesses
moved up this year's export tasks to last year as they were aware
that the country was to begin adjusting export tariffs early this
year, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
He also attributed the export shrinkage to businesses cutting
back on exports of less-profitable items, the increase of export
costs and trade protectionism by foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, China is able to overcome all these
difficulties, and to realize this year's foreign trade
objectives.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Condemns Israeli Bombardment Of Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today condemned
Israel's bombardment of southern Lebanon and asked the United Nations
to urge Israel to stop the air strike.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi told a press
gathering here today that Israel should immediately stop the
attacks and withdraw from Lebanon. Israel's acts could jeopardize
the peace process in the region.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said, "The continuous attacks on Lebanon towns and
villages constitute a violation of the sovereignty and
independence of Lebanon and are in direct defiance of
U.N. Security Council Resolution 425 which calls on Israel to
unconditionally withdraw from the Lebanese territory."
</P>
<P>
He said that the "excessive and indiscriminate" acts by Israel
have caused wanton destruction of property and loss of innocent
lives among Lebanese citizens.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Security Council to press Israel to stop the
attacks and withdraw from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
A total of 35 Lebanese civilians were killed and more than 140

<HEADLINE> Commonwealth Group Ponders Sanctions On Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian foreign minister
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said here today that the Commonwealth
Ministerial Action Group can propose sanctions against Nigeria if
Nigeria refuses to allow in a mission to visit the country.
</P>
<P>
After receiving Commonwealth Secretary-General Emeka Anyaoku
here today, Abdullah said the action group would meet for the
second time in London by the end of this month. At the meeting, a
possible recommendation on the proper steps to take against
Nigeria would be discussed.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, whatever proposals and actions to be taken
against Nigeria would be forwarded to the next Commonwealth Heads
of Government Meeting for approval.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, Anyaoku said he had contacted the Nigerian
government about allowing the action group to visit the country to
discuss a return to democracy but had received no reply.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said the Nigerian government refused to accept a
mission by the action group because it wanted to discuss other
issues first especially its suspension from the Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth action group consists of Malaysia, Zimbabwe,
Jamaica, Ghana, Britain, New Zealand and Canada.

<HEADLINE> China's Top Legislator Stresses Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WINNIPEG, Canada, April 17 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator
Qiao Shi today stressed the importance of raising public awareness
of environmental protection in his country and said sustainable
development will become a focus of attention in China over the
next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Environmental laws and regulations should be strictly enforced
because environmental protection has a direct impact on the lives
of generation after generation of Chinese people, Qiao told
Canadian environmental experts at the International Institute for
Sustainable Development (IISD) in Winnipeg, Manitoba.
</P>
<P>
Qiao, chairman of the Standing Committee of China's National
People's Congress (NPC), said the principle of China's
environmental protection is that unpolluted areas should be in no
way contaminated and areas already polluted should be gradually
cleaned up.
</P>
<P>
"China pays great attention to environmental protection," Qiao
said, citing the establishment of the Environmental and Resources
Protection Committee under the NPC (parliament) and the series of
environmental laws approved over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
"The question now is to step up law enforcement," Qiao noted.
</P>
<P>
He also spoke highly of the cooperation between the China
Council for International Cooperation on Environment and
Development and its Canadian partners, including the IISD.
</P>
<P>
Qiao will leave the Manitoba capital on Thursday for Regina in
Saskatchewan Province. From there he will go on to Vancouver, the
final stop of his five-city Canadian tour.

<HEADLINE> China Publishes Works by Pushkin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A seven-volume Chinese-language
version of Russian poet Pushkin's selected works has just been
published here.
</P>
<P>
It is designated by the Chinese translators as a special gift
for the upcoming China visit by Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Pushkin, whose "The Captain's Daughter" was published in 1903
in Chinese as the earliest piece of Russian literature introduced
to Chinese readership, is a household word in China and most of
Pushkin's works are already available in Chinese versions.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Pushkin is just one of many big names of Russian
literature with a large Chinese following. According to Lu Yong,
deputy secretary-general of the Translators Association of China,
Russian literature, for its critical and democratic spirit, has
long been popular in Chinese literary circles.
</P>
<P>
In the 1930s and 1940s works by Gorky, Dostoyevsky, Gogol and
Turgenev were translated into Chinese. And masterpieces such as
Tolstoy's "Anna Karenina" and "War and Peace", Gorky's "Mother"
and "Childhood" and novels by Turgenev and Gogol have been
republished many times.
</P>
<P>
According to estimates, over the past more than four decades a
total of 5,000 kinds of Soviet and Russian literary works have
been published in Chinese, including poems, novels, dramas and
research works.
</P>
<P>
Chinese translating and publishing circles are promoting
Russian literature by translating more works by Russian literary
masters, Lu said.

<HEADLINE> BOT Method Being Tried in Liaoning Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning Province, an old
industrial area in northeast China, is set to experiment with the
Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) method for work on major
infrastructure projects in future, a government official announced
here today.
</P>
<P>
The method, which is an internationally-accepted one in
industrial development, is to be tried for a water supply system
in Yingkou City. A Hongkong company has expressed its interest in
cooperating and sent a representative there to look over the
situation.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion, the system is to supply 120,000 tons of water
a day, and will be managed in a market-oriented way, which is
entirely different from the existing system, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The province has previously used World Bank and Asian
Development Bank loans for a large number of water supply,
communications, and pollution treatment projects, but they were
far from adequate for keeping up with economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the province is expected to introduce 800
million US dollars for infrastructure construction in the next
five years.

<P>
SHENZHEN, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A vice-mayor of a city in Hebei
was badly injured in a fight with four men who tried to rob him in
a mini-bus in Shenzhen City, in south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
According to today's "People's Daily", Wu Ping, the vice-mayor
of Hengshui in central China's Hebei Province, received a head
wound and the left part of his face was badly bruised.
</P>
<P>
Local police say that four suspects were arrested a few days
after the fight, when they made another robbery attempt in the
city.
</P>
<P>
The first incident occurred at 8:45 on the evening of April
2. Wu and four colleagues were on their way downtown in a
mini-bus, following a business trip to neighboring Zhuhai City,
when four men in the same bus, stood up, pulled out knives, and
tried to rob them.
</P>
<P>
Two who were sitting beside Wu shouted, "We're robbers!" while
the other two in the rear of the bus shouted at the passengers,
ordering them to hand over their money or other belongings.
</P>
<P>
Wu flew into a rage and jumped to his feet immediately,
striking the taller of the two men with an umbrella. The four of
them then attacked Wu, who was cut in several places and had blood
all over himself, but who kept using his umbrella to fight the men
anyway.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wu's four colleagues had started struggling with the
men, using their umbrellas, and one colleague, Wang Guoliang, was
cut on the left arm.
</P>
<P>
The four men, startled by the reaction to their attempt,
decided to exit the mini-bus through its windows. Wu tried to halt
them, but fell down covered in blood. He was rushed to a nearby
hospital where his head wound required eight stitches.
</P>
<P>
Wu and his group were then sent to Beijing to have their
injuries examined further. On April 5, officials of the Hengshui
city government accompanied them back home and said that local
officials and residents should take their brave actions as a good
example.

COLOMBO, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government
Wednesday announced a full waiver on the import duty on rice for
six months commencing immediately, According to Trade Ministry
sources today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that this is being granted to maintain a
stable rice price because the recent drought in rice producing
areas has caused a shortage of rice in the country and pushed up
the prices.
</P>
<P>
The increasing rice prices have led to the government's
decision to allow the import of 600,000 metric tons of rice to
meet the shortage.
</P>
<P>
The duty waiver on the import of rice is expected to keep
prices close to present levels, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> Refugees in Nepal to Ask India for Passage to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A Bhutanese refugee
organization in Nepal has decided to suspend its three-month-old
appeal march and ask India for a free passage to their homeland,
reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The Appeal Movement Coordinating Council (AMCC) announced in a
press release Wednesday the suspension of its peace march to
Thimbu, capital of Bhutan, and appealed for repatriation of the
refugees in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The AMCC said it had sent an appeal letter to Indian Prime
Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao asking for a free and safe passage to
Bhutan for Bhutanese refugees.
</P>
<P>
The organization said it would seek international support to
press the Indian government to consider the demand.
</P>
<P>
The refugee group began the appeal march in January heading for
Bhutan through the Indian territory, but several batches of its
marchers were arrested by Indian police before crossing the
Nepal-India border.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 refugee marchers had been arrested since then but
most of them were released later unconditionally after Indian
courts judged their arrests illegal.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100,000 Bhutanese refugees have been staying in eastern
Nepal since 1990 when Bhutan began to force those of Nepalese
origin to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
Seven rounds of bilateral talks between Nepal and Bhutan in the
last three years have failed to make any breakthrough in efforts
to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government has asked India to mediate in the
controversial issue as the refugees had reached Nepal via India.
</P>
<P>
But India has insisted that the refugee problem is a bilateral
issue and can only be solved through Nepal-Bhutan talks.

during his visit the stand of NATO's plan to expand eastward and
to assure Poland be among the first group of nations to join NATO.
</P>
<P>
Warsaw formally applied for the NATO membership in October
1991, one year after it had established diplomatic relationship
with the bloc.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the two sides signed the "Partnership for Peace
Program."
</P>
<P>
Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski reiterated Poland's
wish to join NATO during a visit to the NATO headquarters in
January this year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Poland submitted a document on the proposed
negotiation with NATO for its membership.
</P>
<P>
NATO's eastward expansion has been set as one of its priorities
since Spanish politician Solana became NATO's secretary general
last December. Russia is against such an expansion move.
</P>
<P>
Solana's visit to Warsaw is only one stop of his 12-nation tour
in central and eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, he visited former Soviet republics Ukraine, Estonia,
Lithuania and Latvia.
</P>
<P>
After Poland, he will go to Hungary, the Czech Republic,
Slovenia, Croatia, Albania, Bulgaria and Romania.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit in Warsaw, Solana will also meet
Kwasniewski, speakers of the House of Representatives and the
Senate and members of a parliament committee on foreign affairs.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian government
will conduct a case-by-case study on the establishment of branches
by foreign state-owned banks in the country, Deputy Prime Minister
Anwar Ibrahim said at a press gathering here today.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, also minister of finance, said Malaysia would not rush
into further liberalizing its banking system.
</P>
<P>
"We are not in a position to further liberalize immediately
although we are committed to the liberalization program," he said,
adding that Malaysia was rather liberal compared with other
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He said his country already saw a substantial participation of
foreign financial institutions and huge deposits in them.
</P>
<P>
However, he promised that the government would continue to
allow the establishment of foreign financial institutions under
amendments to the existing Banking and Financial Institutions Act
tabled in the parliament last week.
</P>
<P>
"This will give a clear signal to our local financial
institutions that they have to be more aggressive, grow bigger and
become competitive," Anwar said.

<P>
PYONGYANG, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) today criticized the United States for
spreading allegations that Pyongyang poses a "missile threat".
</P>
<P>
The Rodong Sinmun, mouthpiece of the ruling Workers' Party of
Korea, said in a signed article that it was natural for the DPRK
to strengthen national defense in the face of the large numbers of
missiles and nuclear weapons that the U.S. had deployed along the
South Korean border.
</P>
<P>
It was the U.S., not the DPRK, which posed a missile threat,
the article said.
</P>
<P>
It said that recently, the U.S. and South Korea have repeatedly
highlighted developments in missile research in the DPRK, and
South Korean President Kim Young-sam had asked the U.S. to help
limit the manufacture and sale of missiles by the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
The article said that the DPRK will not allow the U.S. to play
the role of "international judge" or "global policeman".
</P>
<P>
According to another report, the DPRK and the U.S. are expected
to hold missile talks on April 19-20 in Berlin, Germany.

NEW DELHI, April 18 (Xinhua) -- India's third force, the
National Front-Left Front, in its manifesto released on Wednesday,
called for a "secular democratic alternative" in the country to
replace corrupt Congress and communal Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP).
</P>
<P>
The six-page joint election manifesto said that only "the
secular democratic alternative can save the country from corrupt
Congress and communal BJP."
</P>
<P>
It assigned a dominant role to the state in the development of
the country's economy. Domestic industry will be freed from
bureaucratic control, but this does not mean withdrawal of the
state from its economic and social commitments. The state will
continue to discharge its obligations to the people and correct
the growing regional economic imbalances. The state will resume
its leading role in the development of infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The public sector has built the foundations of India's
industrialization. Its privatization shall not be permitted. The
right to work will be made a fundamental right. For the
development of agriculture and rural areas, 60 percent of plan and
budget resources shall be invested in them, the manifesto said.
</P>
<P>
"Multinational companies will be invited only in high-tech
areas and they will be kept out of consumer goods sector, small
industries, agricultural sector and financial sector," it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia has spent more than 30
billion U.S. dollars in dealing with problems arising from the
1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster over the past 10 years, said
Russian officials today.
</P>
<P>
On April 26, 1986, the Chernobyl nuclear power station exploded
in the former Soviet Union's Ukraine republic, causing a cloud of
radiation to spread over much of Europe and many deaths have been
attributed to the accident.
</P>
<P>
Sergi Shoigu, minister of Emergency Situation, told a press
conference today that the accident also caused nuclear pollution
to 16 regions in Russia, leaving 3 million people, including
600,000 children, affected with radiation.
</P>
<P>
A total of 200,000 people have participated in clearing away
the nuclear pollution in the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Of the 200,000, 6,000 have died from radiation, 32,000 have
been left lifelong disabled.
</P>
<P>
Handling the aftermath of the accident has cost Russia 30
billion dollars during the 1986-1989 period while more than 2
billion dollars used from 1992 to 1995, said a vice minister of
Emergency Situation.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government is expected to allocate 2.6 trillion
roubles (about 529 million dollars) this year to the clean-up of
nuclear pollution, payment of the relevant allowances and the
reconstruction in the disaster areas.
</P>
<P>
But on the same occasion, both officials also stressed the need
to develop the nuclear energy industry.

DHAKA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi President Abdur Rahman
Biswas has justified his power over the Defense Ministry and
pointed out that his control over the ministry is in accordance

</P>
<P>
Major cities in the province discharge great amounts of sulphur
dioxide and atmospheric pollution every year. And 83 percent of
the province's 24 rivers are polluted to various degrees.
</P>
<P>
The environmental protection rules focus on environmental
protection in the development of coal resources, the protection of
natural resources and eco-environment, and sustained development
of the energy and petrochemical industries.
</P>
<P>
The rules stipulate that the governments must report regularly
the environmental situation to the people's congresses, with
environmental protection serving as an important indictor of an
official's working performance.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The German Government announced
today that it will renew its diplomatic ties with the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia and exchange their ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
According to local press, Germany's last condition for
normalizing the bilateral relations is that the independence of
Macedonia, a former Yugoslavia republic, should be recognized. And
Yugoslavia has done so earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Member countries of the European Union (EU) suspended their
diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia four years ago due to the
Bosnian War. But now, 10 of them have reestablished their ties
with Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Hall Goes Through at European Badminton Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, April 17 (Xinhua) -- England's Darren Hall, the
1988 European champion, moved into the last 16 after beating
Norway's Erik Lia in the European Badminton Championships in
Herning, Denmark on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hall, 30, third seed, criticised the playing conditions after
the match. Hall, suffering from a sore throat, was relegated to
the secondary arena for the match against a player ranked 122 in
the world, and he reckoned the lack of atmosphere contributed to
a performance in which he dropped the opening game before winning
11-15, 15-6, 15-5.
</P>
<P>
Another English seed, Peter Knowles, also had to fight back
from dropping the first game to Welsh schoolboy, Richard
Vaughan, who had celebrated his 18th birthday on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At 8-11 down in the second game, Knowles, the eighth seed, was
handed a conduct warning for swearing, but it proved to be the
turning point in a match he went on to win 2-15, 18-13, 15-7.
</P>
<P>
The Danish top seeds, Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen and Camilla
Martin, both advanced with ease, but Russia's Elena Rybkina did
produce an upset by knocking out fifth seed Vlada Tcherniavskaia
of Belarus in the women's event.
</P>
<P>
Rybkina, a semifinalist in Glasgow in 1992, scored with an easy
win with 11-5, 11-2.

<HEADLINE> Italian Soccer Club Torino up for Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ROME, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Relegation-threatened Italian
serie A side Torino went on sale in Turin on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The club said president Gian Marco Calleri, the main
shareholder, and minority holders Bruno Bonacina and Giovanni
Cottino had agreed to sell their stakes.
</P>
<P>
Calleri, who has received frequent abuse from Torino
supporters recently, said he had asked his financial advisers to
evaluate any eventual bids for the club which has already
changed coach three times this season.
</P>
<P>
Torino's heyday was immediately after World War Two. They
won the league title from 1945 to 1949, when the entire squad
was killed in an air crash outside the city.
</P>
<P>
The club last won the league in 1976 and are currently one
place above bottom club Padova.
</P>
<P>
Former Lazio chairman Calleri rescued Torino in 1994 at a
time when it looked as if the club, which currently has French
international defender Jocelyn Angloma and Ghanaian striker Abedi
Pele on its books, was heading for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
The club, caught up in judicial investigations at the time,
had an estimated debt of 50 billion lire ($30 million).

<HEADLINE> Moscow Summit to Tackle Nuclear Security: France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The closure of unsafe nuclear
reactors similar to those at Chernobyl and the improved management
of nuclear material will be discussed at the forthcoming nuclear
summit in Moscow, a French presidential spokeswoman said today.
</P>
<P>
Catherine Colonna said the Group of Seven industrialized states
will provide some 3 billion U.S. dollars to help Ukraine close the
stricken Chernobyl nuclear power station and improve safety at
other reactors.
</P>
<P>
The explosion of a reactor in the Chernobyl plant on April 26,
1986, was the world's worst nuclear disaster Some 2.5
million people, including 900,000 children, were affected by the
accident which sent a radioactive cloud over vast areas of Belarus
and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The Moscow meeting, to be held on Friday and Saturday a week
before the 10th anniversary of the explosion, will also ask
Russia, a declared nuclear power, for assurances not to dump
radioactive waste into the sea, said Colonna.
</P>
<P>
Described by the spokeswoman as unprecedented, this will be
the first time the G7 has met as a group on the soil of its
old Cold War adversary.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also deal with the world's growing stockpile
of dangerous nuclear material -- tons of plutonium, from warheads
and reactors, as well as highly-enriched uranium -- and find ways
to prevent its smuggling.
</P>
<P>
The disposal and management of nuclear material will be tackled
again at an international meeting in Paris at the end of the year,
said Colonna.

telephone number as that of the food firm.
</P>
<P>
Since then, according to the complaint Li filed, his house had

from early morning to the midnight from people believing they were
ringing the food firm. On one day he counted 112 wrong numbers.

to stop distributing the telephone number. He also asked for cash
for mental suffering.
</P>
<P>
he food firm discovered the problem and said that they would
stop distributing it immediately. But they refused to compensate.

compensation.

<HEADLINE> Macao Residents Choose More Fresh Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Macao residents have begun to
choose more fresh beef in recent days instead of frozen one as a
result of the fear of possible "mad cow disease," a local report
said.
</P>
<P>
Today's "Tai Chung Pou" newspaper reported that the Macao
Butchery House has increased supply of fresh beef following the
rise of demand in recent days because many people are afraid of
eating imported frozen beef.
</P>
<P>
An executive of the Macao Butchery House was quoted as saying
that the house now slaughters about 20 heads of cattle each day to
meet increasing demand.
</P>
<P>
In the past, most customers like to choose imported beef for
its better quality. But that trend stopped in recent days because
of fear of the "mad cow disease".
</P>
<P>
Macao began to ban import of British beef, mutton and related
products earlier this month following reports about the discovery
of the mad cow disease in Britain.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Approves Release of Arms to Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government has
decided to release 368 million U.S. dollars worth of military
equipment to Pakistan after a study of the situation in the south
Asian nation, the State Department said today.
</P>
<P>
"Following a review of relevant issues and consultations with
members of Congress, the administration is proceeding with the
release to Pakistan of 368 million U.S. dollars worth of
non-strategic military equipment," State Department spokesman Glyn
Davies told a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Davies said the military equipment was ordered by Pakistan
prior to the U.S. imposition of the Pressler amendment, which
sanctioned Pakistan from receiving U.S. military aid and weaponry
until it pledged to halt nuclear weapons development programs.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the deal would include three P-3C Orion naval
patrol aircraft designed for anti-submarine warfare, Harpoon
missiles, howitzers, rockets and rocket launchers, as well as
various spare parts to service the equipment.
</P>
<P>
But the release would not include 28 F-16 Fighting Falcon
fighter jets. Pakistan paid 650 million dollars for the aircraft
in late 1980s but never received them due to the imposition of the
Pressler amendment.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has been urging the U.S. government to deliver the jet
fighters.
</P>
<P>
Davies said the release "involves only equipment that Pakistan
purchased prior to Oct. 1, 1990. It does not include any new
sales."
</P>
<P>
"This release does not constitute the resumption of any kind
of a U.S. military supply relationship with Pakistan," the
spokesman said.

LIUZHOU, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Liuzhou City in south China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has prohibited the use of all
electronic game centers, ballrooms, and karaoke parlors by primary
and middle school students.
</P>
<P>
According to today's "People's Daily", the move by the local
government is aimed at keeping unhealthy social practices from
having a bad effect on students in their youth.
</P>
<P>
The city has nearly 800 game centers, ballrooms, and karaoke
parlors.
</P>
<P>
Recently, a middle school put forth a motion that its students
stay away from these places of entertainment, and it soon spread
to other local schools.
</P>
<P>
On April 8, the local education commission, public security
bureau, and industrial and commercial administration jointly
issued a notice, ordering these places not to admit students any
more.
</P>
<P>
According to the notice, those who violate the rule face
possible fines, license suspension, or harsher legal sanctions.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of Chinese cities have started to
encourage persons below the age of 18 not to frequent such public
places. But Liuzhou went a step further, banning the activities
instead of simply restricting them.

MANAGUA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Nicaragua's general elections in
October have hit financial problems, but the country's top
election official has insisted the election must go ahead as
planned.
</P>
<P>
The elections will cost 31.8 million U.S. dollars, but there is
only 17.8 million dollars available, Rosa Marina Zelaya, president
of the Supreme Electoral Council (CSE) said today.
</P>
<P>
An extra 14 million dollars needs to be found -- 7.1 million
for carrying out the elections and 6.9 million for normal CSE
expenses. But, said the president, he hopes the international
community will make up the shortfall.
</P>
<P>
The new president warned in a morning interview that
postponement or cancellation of the elections would be extremely
hurtful to the democratic process in Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Despite the financial difficulties, he insisted that the
general elections be held on October 20 as scheduled and that the
CSE would continue to work on the assumption that the elections
will be held on that date.

NANNING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 3.2 billion yuan has
been poured into an aid-the-poor project in south China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region, helping more than four million people
cast off poverty.
</P>
<P>
One of the poorest areas in China, the autonomous region has
ten percent of the country's poverty-stricken people, suffering
shortage of money, food, water and with an undeveloped transport
system.
</P>
<P>
During the past five years, the region terraced 53,000 ha of
mountain slopes, transformed nearly 53,000 ha of low-yielding
farmland, and built 14,000 km of new local highways.
</P>
<P>
Construction work on water conservancy helped more than 2.8
million people get access to water. And the region afforested and
planted fruit trees on more than five 330,000 ha of land, and
planted more than 130,000 ha of cash crops.
</P>
<P>
It also set up nearly 4,000 industrial and town-ship
enterprises, providing jobs for more than 700,000 poorly-off
people.
</P>
<P>
The region also helped resettle nearly 100,000 people from
resource-lacking areas to productive land.
</P>
<P>
The region now plans to provide clothing and food for an
average 1.2 million destitute people annually, in a bid to help
all the region's poor shake off poverty by the turn of this
century.

<P>
YANGON, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of Myanmar State Law and
Order Restoration Council Than Shwe, in a recent tour to Bagan,
the center of ancient Myanmar civilization, stressed perpetuation
of its cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
Repairing and restoring the ancient pagodas and stupas by
well-wishers are to be allowed under supervision of the Myanmar
Archaeology Department, the state-run paper "The New Light of
Myanmar" today quoted the senior general as saying.
</P>
<P>
Restoration, repair and maintenance of ancient pagodas in Bagan
started in August 1995. It is planned to restore 120 more pagodas
in 1996-97, the senior general said, adding that 892 pagoda sites
were found and 60 of them have been excavated.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is making efforts to beautify the environment of Bagan
in order to attract more foreign visitors especially in this
year-end's "Visit Myanmar Year" which is scheduled to open on
November 18.
</P>
<P>
Bagan, 193 km south of Myanmar's largest city Mandalay, is
known as the city of four million pagodas and is one of the
richest archaeological sites in Asia.
</P>
<P>
about 2,000 pagodas, temples and monasteries were built during

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate voted 91-8 to
approve an anti-terrorism bill today.
</P>
<P>
The House-Senate compromise bill is now moving to the House for
final congressional action. The House was expected to take up the
bill on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The legislation would limit federal appeals by death-row
inmates and other prisoners and provide for the death penalty in
certain international terrorism cases and for killing a federal
employee because of the employee's work.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton had asked Congress to give law
enforcement agencies even broader power to combat terrorism after
the April 19, 1995, Oklahoma bombing killed 168 people.
</P>
<P>
The compromise bill restores some administration-backed
law-enforcement powers cut by House members, such as barring fund
raising by foreign terrorist groups, but it omits others. The
Senate today rejected every attempt by Democrats to restore more.
</P>
<P>
The bill would create several new federal crimes, including:
</P>
<P>
-- committing an international terrorist attack in the United
States, punishable by execution if a death occurred.
</P>
<P>
-- using the United States as a base to plan a terrorist attack
overseas.
</P>
<P>
-- killing or trying to kill any federal employee or former
employee because of that person's work, punishable by execution if
a death occurred.

the country's membership of the western military alliance.
</P>
<P>
Solana is on a tour of 12 central and east European nations for
talks on NATO's planned eastward expansion.
</P>

will drop its bid to join the alliance in order to preserve its
relations with Moscow.

stance will not change even after Russia's presidential election
in June.

SHANTOU, April 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 300 million US dollars
were netted from the export of agricultural products in Shantou,
in south China's Guangdong Province last year, a seven percent
rise over 1994.
</P>
<P>
The coastal city resorted to Sino-foreign co-operation,
compensation business, and foreign loans which brought in more
than 300 million US dollars during the past five years to enliven
the local export-oriented agricultural economy.
</P>
<P>
It also imported more than 200 fine strains of fruit,
vegetables and aquatic products, as well as more than 100 sets of
processing equipment from Taiwan, and Spain, Japan and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Shantou also tightened co-operation with domestic and
overseas scientific research institutes, colleges and universities
to import many new agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
The city now has five 670-ha fruit orchards, four 670-ha
vegetable bases, and three 670-ha aquatic products bases, to
provide popular agricultural products for export to dozens of
countries.

<HEADLINE> 300 People in Hong Kong to Be Retested for AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 18 (Xinhua) -- About 300 Hong Kong people who
have been falsely cleared of carrying HIV will be retested for
Aids next week, "Eastern Express" reported today.
</P>
<P>
A Hospital Authority spokeswoman Selina Lo said that the group
of people, mainly patients from Princess Margaret Hospital and
Tang Siu Kin Hospital would be retested.
</P>
<P>
The need for new tests arose last week after a United States
company, Abbott Laboratories, was forced to admit that its IMx
HIV1-HIV2 3rd Generation Plus test had incorrectly diagnosed some
carriers of the disease as negative.
</P>
<P>
The announcement sparked worldwide panic and forced the retest
of about 70,000 British and Dutch people.
</P>
<P>
Lo said that at this stage only Princess Margaret and Tang Siu
Kin had been affected.
</P>
<P>
The superintendent of Evangel Hospital, Jack Hung, said last
week that 36 patients had also been tested with the suspect kit at
his hospital.

BELGRADE, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The three Bosnian factions have
expressed readiness to withdraw all heavy weapons from frontlines
by the deadline of midnight on Friday, a spokesman for the
NATO-led Peace Implementation Force (IFOR) said today.
</P>
<P>
James Daniels said in the Bosnian town of Vitez that Bosnian
Croats, Serbs and Muslims have all promised to carry out their

<P>
The peace accord provides that the three parties should
assemble their 800 tanks, 1,300 artillery pieces and thousands of
other heavy weapons, and put them under the surveillance of IFOR.
They are also required to withdraw about 300,000 troops to
barracks from frontlines.
</P>
<P>
Daniels said the task is huge and its completion may be delayed
because all the three parties lack transportation.

Parliament will discuss later this month government proposals

<HEADLINE> Jiaotong University Aims at World Class Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Jiaotong University,
one of China's oldest universities, will expand its student body
from 13,000 to 20,000 around the turn of the century, aiming to
become one of the world's top universities, the China Daily
reports today.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more graduate and post-graduate programs will be
launched, and ten state-level scientific research centers will be
established in the university.
</P>
<P>
"We plan to build Jiaotong into a premier university in the
world by the first decade of next century," said the university
president Wen Shilie.
</P>
<P>
Jiaotong is among the few universities chosen by the central
government to lead special educational initiatives for the next
century.
</P>
<P>
Wen said the university plans to intensify co-operation with
the world's top universities, as well as leading Chinese
corporations and other universities in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Jiaotong was initially founded as a government-sponsored
college in 1896, which was originally called Nan Yang, and the
name Jiaotong was adopted in 1921.
</P>
<P>
During the last 100 years, Jiaotong has turned out about 80,000
graduates, including a galaxy of celebrated scientists, social
activists, artists and moguls.

<HEADLINE> Recovery Ahead for Real Estate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The paper cited the spring report of the China Real Estate
Index (CREI) released yesterday as saying that China's property
sector has matured, and also has benefited from strengthened
macro-control, since mid-1993.
</P>
<P>
Wild swings have levelled out over the years, as the State
imposed tight credit controls on the sector and developers grew
more knowledgeable about their investment structure.
</P>
<P>
Stabilized market performance has prepared the sector for a
comeback, but not necessarily the boom that developers might wish
for, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The CREI results for the first quarter of the year reported
that property prices in 12 of its 15 sample cities went on dipping
at a narrowed margin when compared with the market performance for
the fourth quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing CREI index ended at 1084 points, down 5 percentage
points from teh October-December results last year. That compared
to a 23-percentage-point drop in the previous quarter from the
third quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, the CREI drop slowed to 11 percentage points last
quarter, from 19 percentage points the previous quarter; in
Tianjin, the drop slowed to 5 percentage points from 37 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
Prices rose in Chongqing, Sichuan province; Liuzhou, Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region; and Changzhou, Jiangsu province; but the
CREI report noted that all the ups and downs remain within the
range of normal market fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
The survey results indicated that during the first quarter the
market, tied up in handling over-supply, continued levelling out.
</P>
<P>
But given the tightened credit policies and aggravated
oversupply, self-correction alone is non sufficient to refresh the
sector, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that more houses were sold than were built in
1995, overstock is feared to keep expanding this year and next as
a result of tighter credit, explosive growth of supply in a
relatively short time, and extremely high housing prices that
private buyers can hardly afford.
</P>
<P>
Developers, already plagued by comparatively low returns, have
little room to further turn down prices, and the editors of the
report noted that the only way to resolve the sector's problems
might be further development. They acknowledged that the sector's
future also depends on the well-being of the national economy,
with control of inflation the most prominent factor.
</P>
<P>
Citing the State's decision to stop opening inflation-proof
accounts last month, the report stated that price hikes in China
are well under control, which is believed a prerequisite for the
State to loosen credit controls.
</P>
<P>
It cautioned that the potential for further price hikes remains
strong, adding that even if the State opts to loosen its
purse-strings, the effects will not be felt until the latter half
of this year.

<HEADLINE> China Medicinal Plant Providing Cure for Rubber Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese scientist has found an
answer to the country's shortage of rubber. His winning formula
uses a common rubber plant, used in traditional Chinese Medicine
for its medicinal properties, to produce lucrative rubber.
</P>
<P>
Yan Ruifang, a researcher at Chemistry Institute under the
Chinese Academy of Sciences has invented a method to extract
gutta-percha -- a kind of raw material of rubber -- from the
leaves of the eucommia.
</P>
<P>
He said the extraction technique has already advanced, and now
trial production is being conducted.
</P>
<P>
The major problem for the future, he said, will be how to
extract more gutta-percha from the leaves, explaining that a
single percentage point improvement in gutta-percha content will
lower costs by 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Eucommia, a deciduous plant, is rich in hard rubber. Its leaves
contain three percent rubber content, barks contain eight percent
rubber content and roots contain some ten percent rubber content.
</P>
<P>
Products made of eucommia rubber can stand temperatures as high
as 500 degrees celsius and chemical erosion.
</P>
<P>
There are now some 200,000 hectares of eucommia trees across
China, mainly in southwest China's Yunnan, Sichuan and Guizhou
provinces, central Hunan and Hebei provinces, and northwest
China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
According to Lu Bailing, head of the Rubber Industry Research
and Design Institute under the Ministry of Chemistry, the
worldwide shortage of rubber resources has led to soaring rubber
prices, and the exploration of new rubber resources is a major
target for the rubber industry.
</P>
<P>
The development of eucommia rubber will help resolve the
problem, he said.

<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Honduran army seized 900
kilograms of cocaine in international waters off the Honduran
coast today, police authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Captain Danilo Osrellana, public relations chief for the
police, said the operation took place close to the jungle region
of "mosquita," which lies on the Nicaraguan border.
</P>
<P>
On seeing that they were spotted by an air force helicopter,
the crewmen of the drug-carrying boat threw their shipment into
the sea and fled. They are believed to have taken refuge
somewhere on the Atlantic coast such as the Islas de la Bahia
afterwards.
</P>
<P>
The confiscated drugs were taken to Miami by U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration agents because they were seized in
international waters, outside the jurisdiction of Honduras.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, Honduran police have seized
about 512 kilograms of cocaine that was being smuggled on way from
Colombia to the United States.

<HEADLINE> China Still has 145 Million Illiterates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- China still has 145 million
illiterates, about 12 percent of the population, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 35 million of the number are aged between 15 to 45,
the backbones of the country's workforce.
</P>
<P>
"The eradication of illiteracy is still an urgent task,"said
Wang Cunming, vice-minister of the State Education Commission.
</P>
<P>
China's adult literacy rate was merely 85 percent in 1995,
behind most countries in Latin America and some of its neighbors
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The adult illiteracy rate in Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin, the
three biggest cities in China, was only a little higher than that
of Thailand, and approximated that of Viet Nam.
</P>
<P>
Though the past four decades witnessed a dramatic drop in the
illiteracy rate, the absolute number of illiterates was still so
big as to be an adverse factor in the modernization drive, Wang
said.
</P>
<P>
And though the primary school enrollment rate has reached 98
percent, the drop-out rate before the fourth grade is remarkable,
adding two million illiterates every year.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the literacy efforts in the country still
require tenacity.

<HEADLINE> Medical Reform Benefited Workers in Yantai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Medical reform setting up an
overall social medical fund has become a lifesaver to over 650,000
workers and retired employees in Yantai, Shandong Province,
today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The fund has paid some 7.8 million yuan (about 900,000 US
dollars) for more than 1,800 people since its establishment early
this year.
</P>
<P>
Kong Qingcun, 57, an engineer with Zhaoyuan Linglong Gold Mine,
owes his life to the medical reform.
</P>
<P>
Kong was diagnosed with lung cancer last year and has been
hospitalized six times for medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
All 180,000 yuan (about 21,000 US dollars) in medical
expenditures have been reimbursed from the medical fund.
</P>
<P>
Yantai was selected as one of the pilot cities for medical
reform by the State Council early this year as a follow-up to
successful practices in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province, and Jiujiang,
Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The central government hopes to build a new type of
medical-insurance system for Chinese workers and to better meet
basic medical demands.
</P>
<P>
The new system is expected to help prevent abuse of medical
resources and alleviate heavy financial burdens caused by
increasing medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
The experiments have attempted to create a new
medical-insurance system that ingrates social medical funds with
personal accounts.
</P>
<P>
In the coastal city of Yantai, all 4,700 institutes and
enterprises have so far taken part in the reform.

<HEADLINE> State Seeks Stronger Control of Salaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- China will strengthen its
macro-economic control of salaries, while accelerating the reform
of state-owned enterprises' salary system during the 1996-2000
period, Zhu Jiazhen, vice-minister of Labor said.
</P>
<P>
More and more workers in the enterprises will have their wages
linked to economic performance of their enterprises, with the
annual growth rate of wages kept around 4.5 percent in line with
the country's economic development, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Based on the principle of distribution "to each according to
his work", the new wage system is based on the market mechanisms
and enterprise performance, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu called on all provinces, municipalities and autonomous
regions to carry on the reform, and not to seek higher standards
when setting local wage scales.
</P>
<P>
The pay gap between different groups, different regions and
different trades will be gradually narrowed by improving personal
income tax system, Zhu added.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Not Opposed to NATO's Expansion in Principle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine is not opposed to NATO's
eastward expansion in principle, but will put its own national
security interests first, Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister
Konstantin Grishchenko said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Any country has the right to choose whether to join a political
or military organization, he told a seminar on external affairs
and security issues in Kiev.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed "Ukraine will first consider its national
interests in the aspect of security in exercising its own right."
</P>
<P>
The eastward expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) should be a gradual process in which the
organization should reform itself to make it a more extensive
Europe-North Atlantic security organization, said the deputy
minister.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's expansion of cooperation with the alliance reflects
the special partnership which has been set up between them.
</P>
<P>
Grishchenko also said Ukraine's policy of not joining any
military alliance does not rule out the possibility of the country
joining a military-political organization in a new European common
security system.
</P>
<P>
He would like to see reform of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe to improve the efficiency of its
activities.

<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Those trying to protect precious
species of China's fauna and flora will rely not only on the
nature reserves that are natural habitats, but also on data files
regarding wildlife and the reserves.
</P>
<P>
China has now set up some 800 reserves of various types
throughout the country, ranging from natural ecological systems to
reserves for wildlife and natural relics, today's "China Daily"
reported.
</P>
<P>
This English newspaper said that 518 out of these 800 reserves
are specially designed for the protection of wild fauna and
flora. These reserves cover 51 million hectares, 5.34 percent of
the country's territory.
</P>
<P>
The first administrative regulations on file management of
China's nature reserves were issued last week by the Ministry of
Forestry and the State Achieves Bureau, with the goal of improving
the level of protection of wildlife and their habitats.
</P>
<P>
The regulations rule that relevant organizations and people
should be assigned to collect and maintain data files and carry
research based on the information in them.

MOSCOW, April 17 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana, now visiting east European and Baltic countries keen to
join the organization, said today that the decision on new NATO
memberships will be made by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
He said at a press conference in Estonia, the third leg of his

that NATO has started separate negotiations with all countries

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan held on India's
strong attack and managed a 2-2 draw in the final match of the
six-nation pre-Olympic men's hockey tournament, chalking up the
trophy on Wednesday in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
It was Pakistan's second tournament title since it won the
World Cup in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan dominated the first half, with Tahir Zaman giving
the winners the lead from their first penalty corner after
only three minutes.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan scored its second goal in the 39th minute.
</P>
<P>
But India quickly bounced back two minutes later through Baljit
Singh's goal on a back pass from 10 meter out.
</P>
<P>
India struggled to a 2-all tie through a penalty kick. However,
India, which kept the Pakistanis under intense pressure, needed a
win to snatch the trophy from Pakistan. Anyway, holding Pakistan
to a draw, India denied Pakistan five straight victories in the
tournament. India finished second, with three wins and two draws;
two points ahead of third placed Britain.
</P>
<P>
In the day's other match, Argentina, the Pan-American
champions, lifted itself off the bottom of the table,
collecting its first points with its 12th win in 13 matches
against the United States.

<HEADLINE> Survey Finds Little Change in Violent Crime Rates in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Overall rates of violent crime
changed little between 1993 and 1994 while the number of sexual
assaults dropped 33 percent in the United States, the Justice
Department said today.
</P>
<P>
Property crimes continued a 15-year decline, falling from 32.2
million in 1993 to 31 million in 1994, according to the
department's National Crime Victimization Survey.
</P>
<P>
The year of 1994 saw an estimated 10.9 million violent crimes,
including 6.6 million simple assaults, 2.5 million aggravated
assaults, 1.3 million robberies and 430,000 rapes or other types
of sexual assault. The survey excludes murder because it isn't
possible to interview the victims.
</P>
<P>
The figures were basically the same as in 1992 and 1993, said a
report released by the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice
Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Sexual assault, which includes molestation and other crimes
short of rape and attempted rape, fell 33 percent, between 1993
and 1994, according to a bureau statistician.
</P>
<P>
Data for the report were collected from national surveys of
households and prisons and from information the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) receives from more than 17,000 law enforcement
agencies nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Pankratov's World Best Times not Recognised by FINA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 17 (Xinhua) -- World best times clocked by
Russian swimmer Denis Pankratov cannot be recognised as records
because no doping controls were carried out, the International
Amateur Swimming Federation (FINA) annouced here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The European champion eclipsed the short-course world marks in
the 100 and 200 meters butterfly at a World Cup meeting in Paris,
 clocking one minute 52.34 seconds in the 200 on February 3 and
51.94 seconds in the 100 the following day.
</P>
<P>
But a FINA official said the Russian's times could not be
recognised as world records because no doping controls had been
carried out.
</P>
<P>
FINA decided last November in a package of anti-doping
measures that doping controls should be carried out within 24
hours for a world record to be officially recognised.
</P>
<P>
Pankratov broke the long-course 100 and 200 metres butterfly
records last year and is strong favourite to win both events at
the Atlanta Olympics in July.

<HEADLINE> PNG Re-imposes Blockade On Bougainville </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 18 (Xinhua) -- The Papua New Guinea (PNG)
government re-imposed a military blockade on the war-troubled
province of Bougainville from today.
</P>
<P>
According to Australian newspaper reports, a notice issued by
the PNG Defense Force declared resumption of "blanket
restrictions" on the movement of goods, services and people into
and within the island province from midnight on April 17.
</P>
<P>
But PNG Prime Minister Julius Chan said that he was not aware
of the re-imposition of the blockade.
</P>
<P>
The notice was issued in the name of the PNG Defense Force
Forward Tactical Commander for Bougainville Yaura Sasa. The Notice
said that all direct shipping and air services to the island had
been halted and now would have to be cleared by the PNG Defense
Force headquarters in Rabaul in New Britain.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of blockade followed the PNG government's
decision to lift the ceasefire on Bougainville last month. Prime
Minister Chan has sent armed troops to the island again.
</P>
<P>
Local armed forces in Bougainville have been fighting for
independence since the civil war broke out in late 1980s. The
first military blockade was imposed on the island in 1990, when
Bougainville unilaterally declared independence.

<HEADLINE> Three College Students Bring Ancient Art to the People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Three students decided that if
people could not visit China's famous fresco paintings -- they
would bring the frescoes to the people.
</P>
<P>
So Wang Jue, Pu Ning and Tuo Yan, students from the Normal
College of Shenyang University, based in the capital city of
Liaoning province, painstakingly copied a selection of the famous
arts works.
</P>
<P>
Now the artistic trio is to hold an exhibition on ancient
Chinese frescoes at their own expense next month in the
Beijing-based Central Academy of Fine Arts.
</P>
<P>
They will display the fresco paintings that they have carefully
copied during the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The three college students decided two years ago to copy wall
frescoes which could not be moved, so that more people could
appreciate the work. They hatched their plans when they found a
book detailing the collection of famous frescoes in Beijing's
Fahai Temple.
</P>
<P>
They visited Fahai Temple and Yongle Palace in north China's
Shanxi province many times to copy frescoes. They spent more than
40,000 yuan (over 4,800 U.S. dollars) on travelling and producing
copies of some 30 pieces of frescoes during the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Some of the paintings will be auctioned during the exhibition
to raise money for their future painting work.

<HEADLINE> Graf Father to Stand Trial for Tax Evasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Peter Graf, the father of women's
world tennis champion Steffi Graf, was committed for trial
Wednesday along with the family's tax advisor Joachim Eckardt for
failing to declare 42 million marks (28 million dollars) of the
German star's earnings to the tax authorities.
</P>
<P>
According to press reports reaching here, the two face trial on
charges of attempting to evade tax on the champ's earnings before
a commercial affairs chamber of the Mannheim regional court, the
city's prosecutor's office said.
</P>
<P>
Peter Graf, 57, who managed his daughter's lucrative business
affairs, has been held in custody since August 2 1995 following
his arrest. He faces up to nine years in jail if finally found
guilty.
</P>
<P>
According to the 237-page charge sheet, Steffi's father and
Eckhardt are accused of having failed to pay income taxes
totalling 19.6 million marks.
</P>
<P>
The Mannheim prosecutor's office said Peter Graf had, with the
help of the tax advisor, falsely declared or failed to declare
the tennis player's earnings between 1989 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
In 12 instances, a total of 42 million marks had not been
declared, according to the prosecutors, who characterised the
attempted tax evasion as particularly serious.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor's office said they could not yet say whether
Steffi herself had knowingly made false declarations to the tax
authorities, as investigation of her role was not yet complete.
</P>
<P>
Documents in the case fill 170 files.
</P>
<P>
No date for the trial has yet been fixed.
</P>
<P>
Although the player has earned around 180 million marks (128
million dollars) since turning professional 14 years ago, Der
Spiegel magazine recently estimated she had only paid around 25.5
million in tax since 1984. Other reports put the figure as low as
10 million.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Graf celebrated her return from a four-month injury
lay-off with a two-set victory over Conchita Martinez in the
final of the Evert Cup on March 16.

<HEADLINE> Non-Smoking Contest to Start in Three Major Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) -- A lucky Chinese ex-smoker is
about to scoop a 5,000 US dollar bonanza, for kicking the habit.
</P>
<P>
Smokers in China's three major cities of Beijing, Shanghai and
Tianjin are being encouraged to take part in a non-smoking contest
next month, organised by the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
According to reports participants should be aged above 18 and
have a smoking history of more than one year. They should
volunteer to register between April 20 and 30, and refuse to smoke
during May 2 to 30.
</P>
<P>
The contestants should keep their promise of non-smoking during
the four weeks, accept investigation at random and report the
truth to the investigators.
</P>
<P>
Then by a stroke of luck, one of them is expected to win the
5,000 dollars from the WHO officials who will come specially to
Beijing June 3.
</P>
<P>
This contest, sponsored by the WHO, is aimed at encouraging
people to abandon smoking by means of awarding cash. Twenty-one
countries will take part in the contest and observe the same
contest rules.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin, entrusted by the Ministry of
Public Health of China, will take part in the contest on behalf of
China.
</P>
<P>
Sources said such contests worldwide owes to its success in
Europe. So far, the WHO has organized similar contests in Europe
and achieved great success, as about 15 to 20 percent of
participants in Europe abandoned smoking one year after the
contest.
</P>
<P>
Increasing numbers of Chinese cities has started a massive
campaign against smoking, and Beijing has worked out a local
regulation to ban smoking in public places from May 18.
</P>
<P>
At present, one-fourth of China's 1.2 billion population are
smokers, consuming 150 billion cigarettes every year.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Becomes First American to Win Fleche </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Former world champion Lance
Armstrong earned the United States their first victory in the
Fleche Wallonne classic cycling race in Huy, Belgium on Wednesday
when he won the 200.5km hilly stretch from Spa.
</P>
<P>
And afterwards Armstrong explained training back home had
helped him. "Where I come from in Texas, I have a lot of
undulating terrain to train on," Armstrong, the 1993 world road
race champion, said.
</P>
<P>
"And in relation to last year, I have really improved both
physically and mentally and have become patient."
</P>
<P>
Armstrong, 24, seized control at the top of the Huy climb
leaving France's Didier Rous to finish second and the 1988 world
champion Maurizio Fondriest of Italy third.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong, who will attempt to complete the Ardennes double on
Sunday in the Liege-Bastogne-Liege classic, escaped with Rous 10
kilometres from the finish.
</P>
<P>
The American, who won the Tour de France stage into Limoges
last year, drew away from Rous in the final meters of the
vertical climb to claim a famous victory.
</P>
<P>
Rous, who won the International Criterium time trial last month
while helping team leader Chris Boardman win the event, finished
well clear of Fondriest, whose recent form has been affected by
persistent back injuries.
</P>
<P>
Fondriest's problems however persisted throughout the race. "I
suffered with my back again. I hope I feel better for the Liege
race," he said.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland's Mauro Gianetti finished fourth confirming yet
again his return to top form since being knocked unconscious in a
race last year.

NEW YORK, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Share prices on the New York
Stock Market dropped today with profit taking issues expanding and
the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunging on worries about IBM's
profit margins.
</P>
<P>
The Dow industrials tumbled 70.09 points to 5,549.93. In the
previous three sessions, the Dow had erased two-thirds of its
recent 200-point slide, which was caused by interest rate and
inflation worries amid a series of strong economic reports.
</P>
<P>
Most of the other major indicators were also down, but not as
sharply. And the American Stock Exchange's market value index
managed to climb 1.07 points to 580.38 for its second straight
record close.
</P>
<P>
IBM accounted for more than a third of the Dow's slide,
according to analysts. The computer maker's earnings report raised
analyst concerns about profit margins.
</P>
<P>
Technology stocks gave up ground after leading the market
higher Tuesday as strong earnings reports by chip giant Intel and
other key high-tech issues eased worries about sluggishness in the
computer industry.
</P>

Bond prices fell, sending the interest rate on the 30-year
Treasury note over 6.8 percent.

Both Manitoba leaders expressed the willingness to further the
province's friendly ties with China, especially with China's Henan
Province.
</P>
<P>
Qiao, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Chinese
National People's Congress (NPC), is here on a 10-day official
goodwill visit to Canada, which started last Thursday. Canada is
the final leg of Qiao's five-nation tour, which also took him to
Ukraine, Russia, Greece and Cuba.

Extending welcome to Qiao, Speaker Dacquay said the visit will
enhance the friendship between the two countries and the two
peoples.

Manitoba attaches great importance to developing long-term
friendly relations with China, and is ready to build constructive
partnership with China, she told the NPC chairman.

Qiao noted the wide-ranging contacts and close cooperation
between Manitoba and Henan, a Chinese province with a population
of 90 million and famous for its wheat production, just as
Manitoba is.

<P>
The NPC leader expressed the hope that cooperation between the
two provinces will be further developed in the future.

At another meeting, Manitoba Premier Filmon also told Qiao that
his province is ready to further its friendly cooperation with
China, and Henan in particular.

Manitoba has received 12 Chinese delegations, Filmon said, adding
that he himself has visited China several times.
</P>
<P>
A delegation led by the Manitoba agriculture minister will
leave for Henan soon. All these have shown the development of
cooperation between Manitoba and China in various fields, Filmon
said.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Qiao said Henan and Manitoba are both
agricultural provinces and share much common ground. He voiced the
hope that this cooperation will be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
At noon, Dacquay hosted a working banquet for Qiao and his
party.

<HEADLINE> Serbian Authorities Condemn Attack on Belgrade's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Serbian Religion Minister Dragan
Dragojlovic today condemned the vandal attacks on the Bajrakli
Mosque at midnight Monday and earlier on the office of the
Catholic Church of St. Anthony.
</P>
<P>
Dragojlovic told Radio Belgrade that the state must use all
available means to prevent such incidents and discover the
perpetrators as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
During the four-year civil war in neighboring Bosnia and the
biggest waves of refugees from there and from Croatia, Belgrade
and the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia have managed to preserve the
peace and security of its citizens regardless of religious or
national affiliation, Dragojlovic said.
</P>
<P>
"It is evident that the perpetrators of these attacks are
individuals who wish to resolve personal frustrations and problems
in this way. Such attacks are a part of hatred, hostility, and
intolerance," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade police said early Tuesday that the explosion outside
the Bajrakli Mosque early Tuesday had damaged the facade of the
building and broken windows on neighboring buildings.
</P>
<P>
The explosion was caused by a device activated on the sidewalk
outside the mosque. Three automobiles parked in the vicinity were
damaged in the blast.
</P>
<P>
The Committee of the Islamic Religious Community in Belgrade
also condemned the attack on the Bajrakli Mosque today. Belgrade
Mufti Hamdija Jusufspahic told a press conference that there had
fortunately been no casualties in any of the seven attacks on this
mosque since 1990.
</P>
<P>
He also called for special protection of his community after
the only mosque in the Serbian capital was damaged by the bombing.
</P>
<P>
"We demand protection of this mosque and also of those in Mali
Znornik and Nis," he said, mentioning two other Serbian cities.
There are about 2.5 million Muslims among the 11 million
population of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Serbian Democratic Party President Vojislav
Kostunica also strongly condemned the latest violent attack today,
pointing out that authorized organs should react energetically and
find the perpetrators of this and former similar acts as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Serbian Civil Alliance President Vesna Pesic said today that
following Monday's explosion outside the Bajrakli Mosque and the
recent attack on a catholic church, Belgrade was faced with
organized terrorism aimed at intimidating all citizens, and
especially those of other nationalities.

<HEADLINE> 13-hour Weekly Power Blackouts In Addis Ababa May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 17 (Xinhua) -- The 13-hour weekly power
blackouts introduced by the Ethiopian Electric Light and Power
Authority at the end of last year in Addis Ababa may continue
even in next year if conditions do not improve, the ethiopian
news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the Melka Wakana, Koka and Awash hydro
power stations, which generate more than 65 percent of the hydro
electric power in Ethiopia, have been struck by one of the most
serious water shortages ever. The Melka Wakana reservoir received
40 percent less water than the preceding season during the 1995
rainy season, while the Intake at Koka has been less by 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
Manager of the public relations department of the Ethiopian
Electric Light and Power Authority, Sendeku Araya said the
current power rationing, despite the inconveniences it causes, is
the only solution for the time being. He called on the Ethiopian
government to take measures aimed at tapping the country's hydro
electric potential.

BELGRADE, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Spokesman for the Bosnia peace
Implementation Force (IFOR) Maj. Lloyd Thomas said today one of
the IFOR commands would soon be transferred to the Serb city of
Banja Luka.

sector, would be transferred from the town of Gornji Vakuf in the
Muslim-Croat federation in central Bosnia, the Tanjug news agency
said.
</P>

could be in Bosnian Serb-controlled territory. Banja Luka, located
in the northwestern part of the country, is the largest city in
the Serb entity.

The IFOR spokesman said the IFOR command in Banja Luka would
ensure a closer cooperation with international organizations based
there, which are also included in the Bosnia peace process.

Britain, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, the Netherlands
and the Czech Republic, Tanjug said.

Luka.

JOHANNESBURG, April 17 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today endorsed the view of Finance Minister Trevor
Manuel and Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals that the plunging
Rand should not be cause for alarm.
</P>

quite a long time, hit a new record low of 4.2500 against the

to the gradual relaxation of foreign exchange controls and would
not be bullied into ''panic decisions''.

The Rand has depreciated approximately 17 percent from less than
3.70 against the Dollar since mid-February.
