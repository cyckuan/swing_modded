European drug makers Zeneca and Astra in merger talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Britain's Zeneca and Sweden's Astra, two
mid-sized drug makers noted for their pain relief products, are
holding merger talks to create a company that would exceed dlrs 15
billion in annual sales.
	   After rumors of merger discussions for months, the companies
Tuesday disclosed they are in ``advanced discussions.'' A spokesman
for Zeneca, which is slightly bigger than Astra, said it would be
``a merger of equals.'' An Astra spokesman also confirmed the
talks, but refused to elaborate.
	   Astra is best known as the maker of Prilosec, an ulcer and
heartburn medication that's the world's best selling prescription
drug and comprises about half the company's total sales.
	   But the drug is scheduled to lose its patent protection in 2001,
which will open the door for generic firms to make a less expensive
copy and slow the company's overall sales growth. Analysts
speculated that is a leading factor influencing the merger.
	   Sweden's Wallenberg family owns 12 percent of Astra, established
in 1913. The company also makes lidocaine, a popular local
anesthesia drug first developed in the 1940s.
	   Zeneca is the second-leading maker of cancer drugs behind
Bristol-Myers Squibb of the United States. It also has a large
agrichemical business and owns Salick Health Care, a U.S. operator
of cancer treatment and dialysis centers. Last year, Zeneca
introduced its migraine drug Zomig, and earlier this year received
clearance for a breast cancer drug.
	   But like Astra, Zeneca also has several cancer drugs expected to
soon lose their patent protection.
	   ``This is a winning combination,'' said Sergio Traversa, an
analyst with Mehta Partners, a drug industry investment firm.
``Both are strong in limited areas.''
	   Industry observers surmise that Astra was searching for a
partner after it restructured a marketing arrangement with Merck
last spring, allowing the company to get out of the deal by paying
Merck a fee.
	   The disclosure of the Astra-Zeneca merger talks came a week
after Germany's Hoechst and France's Rhone-Poulenc agreed to merge
their drug and agrichemical businesses as the first step toward a
total merger. In France, Sanofi and Synthelabo recently announced
their dlrs 10 billion merger.

Elderly jade hawker dies after setting himself on fire in court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ An elderly jade dealer died Wednesday, two days
after torching himself in a courtroom where authorities refused to
hand back trinkets confiscated when arresting him for illegal
sidewalk sales, hospital officials said.
	   Wong Tai-fuk, 76, described by his wife as a jade lover who sold
the objects mainly to pass the time with other aficionados, had
suffered burns on 70 percent of his body. He died early Wednesday,
according to a Queen Mary Hospital spokeswoman who said she was not
allowed to provide her name.
	   Wong turned himself into a human fireball on Monday in North
Kowloon Court, where he had appeared on charges of selling jade
trinkets without obtaining the required hawker's license.
	   Wong pleaded guilty, and Magistrate James Tam fined him 400 Hong
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 50). Wong asked Tam to return his jade
objects, worth some 20,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 2,560), but
Tam turned him down, saying it was standard legal procedure for
authorities to keep such confiscated goods.
	   Wong then walked to the back of the courtroom, took out a
plastic bottle, doused himself with a flammable liquid and lit
himself before police could restrain him.
	   A police officer extinguished the flames, but by then Wong had
already suffered serious burns.
	   No one answered the phone at the magistrate's office when a
reporter phoned late Wednesday morning.
	   But the Hong Kong Standard quoted a court spokesman as saying,
``It's inappropriate for a judge to talk to the press.''

Prime Minister shares ``intense disappointment'' over cricket
</HEADLINE>
scandal &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian Prime Minister John Howard
said Wednesday he shared a feeling of intense disappointment with
cricket-loving Australians over the scandal involving Test players
Mark Waugh and Shane Warne.
	   The Australian Cricket Board admitted Tuesday night that in
early 1995 it fined both players a total of Australian dollars
18,000 (U.S. dlrs 11,500) after it was found they accepted money
from an Indian bookmaker.
	   Waugh was fined Australian dollars 10,000 (U.S. dlrs 6,400) and
Warne Australian dollars 8,000 (U.S. dlrs 5,100) in February 1995
for accepting money from an illegal Indian bookmaker in exchange
for weather and pitch reports during the short Sri Lankan tour in
1994.
	   That visit preceded the three-test tour of Pakistan during which
Waugh, Warne and a third Australian player Tim May claimed they
were approached by Pakistani cricketer Salim Malik and offered
money to play poorly.
	   Howard, a big cricket fan, said if the issue had been more
openly dealt with at the time it could have saved Australian
cricket from some of the negative connotations associated with the
scandal.
	   But he believed the issue was best left to cricket authorities
to deal with.
	   ``I would imagine that, given the great passion that Australians
have for cricket, there's an intense feeling of disappointment
about the whole issue,'' Howard told reporters.
	   ``Australians love their cricket and anything that looks as
though it's knocking cricket off its pedestal is something that's
going to deeply disturb Australians.''
	   In the national Parliament, Warne and Waugh came under
government attack for damaging Australia's reputation.
	   Sports Minister Jackie Kelly said the revelations had led to
``significant disillusionment with two Aussie icons.''
	   ``It sends a message to all Australian sportsmen that they do
carry the flagship of Australia's reputation, Australia's hopes and
(are) role models for many young kids in Australia who play
sport,'' Kelly said.
	   Former Australian captain Kim Hughes said Shane Warne
involvement in the scandal would damage his chances of ever
captaining Australia.
	   ``It is different to match fixing (but) it is still a shock,''
Hughes said on radio. ``Two blokes who got tremendous records are
now tarnished.
	   ``It's very disappointing for the game.''
	   Hughes said both the ACB and the International Cricket Council
had made matters worse by sweeping the issue under the carpet for
more than three years.

Drug initiatives affecting swimming results, official says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China's poor start at the Asian Games
swim meet showed that efforts by world governing body FINA and the
IOC to get drugs out of the country's system are working, a leading
official said Wednesday.
	   Alan Thompson, president of the World Swimming Coaches
Association, said it was too early to declare China's swim program
clean but he congratulated the work of the two sporting bodies to
bring change.
	   ``I think it's premature to say they are now clean, but the
efforts by FINA and the IOC in China have had a marked effect,''
Thompson told The Associated Press. ``FINA went in there and
disrupted them with tests at a time when they may have been taking
drugs in the past. I think you have got to congratulate FINA for
the work they're doing, and the IOC as well.''
	   After the second session of swim finals, China had three of the
10 golds decided so far while rival Japan had six. In Hiroshima
four years ago, China beat Japan 25-5, but it was later proved that
seven Chinese swimmers had been using steroids.
	   The Chinese were also the subject of rumors a month earlier at
the 1994 world championships, where they set five world records and
won 12 of 16 women's events. Earlier this year, six team members
were sent home in disgrace from the Perth world championships on
drug charges.
	   U.S. officials believe a ban on China competing at the Pan
Pacific Games should be continued for the next edition in Australia
next year because of the world championship scandals. The Pan Pac
organizers will decide China's fate in February.
	   ``I think if we can be assured that they are clean, they can be
there,'' said Thompson. ``Our hope is that testing is maintained,
if not increased, and results such as those from the Asian Games
are encouraging to us. We don't want to see China going backward,
we want them at their full potential, but we do want results to be
based on performances, not drugs.''
	   After this year's world championships in January, FINA formed a
special anti-doping task force in an effort to eliminate
performance-enhancing drugs around the world, with a focus on
China.
	   It sent a five-member delegation there in February and reported
that the Chinese Swimming Association is not part of any systematic
process of doping in swimming.
	   ``The information that I've gained is that doping has been a
problem in a provincial sense rather than by the Chinese
authorities,'' Thompson said. ``The Chinese have been very
embarrassed by the drug problems.''
	   China carried out more than 500 drug tests in the month before
the Asian Games, with at least one unnamed athlete returning a
positive test. Almost 3,000 drug tests in 20 sports have been taken
in China this year, said Shi Kangcheng, deputy secretary of China's
Asian Games delegation.
	   The approach won praise from IOC president Juan Antonio
Samaranch this week.
	   ``I will say that maybe China is today one of the countries
fighting with all their strength against doping and that is quite
important to us,'' Samaranch said.
	   Chinese swim officials say the declining standards are because
of inexperience. The team is missing stars Le Jingyi, He Cihong and
Liu Limin.
	   ``The Chinese team is going through some adjustments,'' said
Xiong Guoming, one of the seven who tested positive in Hiroshima
but now is back in action at the games. ``A number of young
swimmers have joined our team as part of the preparations for the
(Sydney) Olympics.''

Warne's statement on bookmaker payments
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The following is the transcript of a
statement made by Australian cricketer Shane Warne on his
involvement in a betting scandal on the 1994 tour of Sri Lanka:
	   ``During the course of the 1994 tour of Sri Lanka, before we
went to Pakistan, I was approached by a man, who I later discovered
to be bookmaker from India.
	   ``He gave me Australian dollars 5,000 and in return he spoke to
me on several occasions for routine questions like what the pitch
was like, what the weather conditions were.
	   ``I never at any stage told him about team tactics or
selections.
	   ``As the captain of Victoria and a senior Australian cricketer,
I regularly provide much more detailed information to the media
before any match I play.
	   ``However, I realize that I was very naive and stupid.
	   ``I was fined Australian dollars 8,000 by the Australian Cricket
Board and paid the fine immediately.
	   ``I've had no contact with the bookmaker since and am very
disappointed and sorry for my actions.
	   ``I've always strived to do the best I can for my country and I
think that the way I've played and conducted myself on the field
shows that I'm a cricketer with integrity, who has never given
anything but his best.
	   ``I deeply regret this action off the field and wish to state
that playing for Australia is the greatest honor I've had in my
cricketing career.
	   ``I must emphasize that I have never ever been involved in any
match fixing or bribery in any cricket matches at any stage of my
career.''

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ The following is the transcript of a
statement made by Australian cricketer Mark Waugh on his
involvement in a betting scandal on the 1994 tour of Sri Lanka:
	   ``During the course of the 1994 tour of Sri Lanka, I was
approached by a man who asked me to provide routine information
before Australia's one-day matches on that tour.
	   ``He asked me general questions on what the Australian side
expected from the pitch and weather conditions but at no stage did
I discuss team tactics or lineups.
	   ``In return for speaking to me on that handful of occasions he
offered me Australian dollars 6,000 which I accepted.
	   ``At the time did not see the implications of offering such
information, which I thought to be mundane and exactly the same as
any pre-match media interview.
	   ``In early 1995, the Australian Cricket Board asked me if I had
ever provided information to a bookmaker and I replied I had done
so the previous year.
	   ``I was fined Australian dollars 10,000 and paid my fine
immediately.
	   ``I have never spoken to the bookmaker again since.
	   ``In the period since I was fined, the full implications of the
possibility that I may be linked to actions much more sinister than
those I innocently undertook in 1994 have become very clear to me.
	   ``Even while this matter has not been made public until now, I
realize and accept fully that my actions were naive and stupid.
	   ``I regret them entirely and wish to restate in the strongest
possible manner that I have always given my best for my country in
every match I have played and I believe my record, particularly in
the last three years, fully supports this statement.
	   ``I must emphasize that I have never been involved in match
fixing or bribery on cricket matches in any stage of my career.''

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The defense in the corruption and
sex trial of Anwar Ibrahim asked a key prosecution witness
Wednesday if the sacked deputy prime minister had anything to do
with the death of the witness' pregnant wife.
	   Anwar's defense team is trying to prove that as part of a
high-level conspiracy to destroy their client's political career,
Anwar had even been accused of scheming to murder the wife of the
man who says the politician sodomized him.
	   Sodomy is a crime in this predominantly Muslim nation.
	   Anwar is on trial on four counts of abuse of power, and will be
tried later on another charge of corruption and five charges of
homosexual acts. Anwar calls the allegations part of a conspiracy
to quash his challenge to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year
leadership.
	   Azizan Abu Bakar, a key prosecution witnesses, testified last
week that Anwar made him a ``homosexual slave'' while he was a
driver for Anwar's wife. On Monday, Azizan appeared to contradict
himself by testifying he never had sex with the ousted finance
minister.
	   Azizan's wife, who was seven months pregnant, was killed in a
car accident in January when the couple was driving to visit
Azizan's parents. Azizan, who was driving, said that an oncoming
car slammed into the passenger side of his car.
	   A book, ``50 Reasons Why Anwar Cannot Become PM,'' hints that
Anwar schemed to cause the death of Azizan's wife.
	   Azizan was asked if he believed the accusations.
	   He said no, and that no one else but his parents knew about the
planned visit to their home.
	   ``It's inconceivable that Anwar would want to kill me and my
wife,'' Azizan said. ``There's no way my father and mother would
tell anyone.''
	   The Malaysian Attorney General's office has said that the
criminal charges against Anwar were based on a police investigation
into accusations contained in the book.
	   The book was widely distributed at this year's annual convention
of the ruling United Malays National Organization party, where
Anwar's allies campaigned for political reforms.
	   Throughout the cross-examination Wednesday, the prosecution
objected to the line of questioning.
	   Defense attorney Gur Bachan Singh argued his team must be
allowed to attempt to prove the conspiracy theory.
	   ``Besides the charges, there were false and fabricated
allegations against Anwar,'' Gur Bachan said. ``Our contention is
that this was part of a political conspiracy.''
	   Azizan had accused Anwar of forcing him into sodomy in 1992. He
told the court last week that shame and guilt kept him from making
Anwar's repeated homosexual acts public until last year, in which
he signed a sworn statement against Anwar.
	   The defense continued grilling Azizan about his private,
one-hour meeting with Mahathir 10 days before Anwar was sacked.
	   Mahathir fired Anwar on Sept. 2, saying he had determined his
former protege was morally unfit for office. The sacking led to
demands for political reforms and massive anti-government protests
in the normally placid Southeast Asian capital.

Despite food crisis, North Korea's sports machine splutters on
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ North Korea might be starving but the
nation's sports machine splutters on.
	   Despite four years of chronic food shortages, North Korea has
fielded one of the stronger teams at the Asian Games and already
had captured five medals _ including two golds _ just three days
into the two-week competition.
	   The North's respectable showing _ its gymnasts also came fourth
out of eight countries in the men's team competition _ has
confounded expectations that the food crisis and a lack of
international exposure would have crippled the nation in sports.
	   But like its neighbor China, North Korea apparently regards
sport as a window to show off its communist system. This
philosophy, say coaches from rival teams, has prompted North Korea
to keep its sports machine ticking over despite its economic
difficulties.
	   ``Sports is the face of a country, so they want to keep their
teams,'' said Qian Kui, who coaches China's gymnastics squad.
``They'll never get to the point where they disband their teams.''
	   Qian recalled a visit he made to the North just a month after
the death of longtime President Kim Il Sung in 1994. Even though
the nation was in mourning, ``they were still training hard,'' he
said.
	   The North Koreans had videotapes of gymnastics competitions and
``understand what is happening in the gymnastics world,'' said
Qian, who went to North Korea to give nine lectures about
developments in the sport.
	   ``They don't live well, but they still practice hard,'' he said.
``They've been training the whole time.''
	   North Korea skipped the last Asian Games in Hiroshima, Japan, in
1994 and coaches say its appearances at other major international
meets have been erratic. That has made the North a bit of a dark
horse at these games. Even coaches from China, the North's closest
ally, said the North Koreans were something of an unknown quantity.
	   ``I don't know much about them, they very rarely show their
face,'' said Lu Shanzhen, who coaches China's women gymnasts.
	   North Korea's first gold at these games came in shooting _
perhaps not surprising given that the country's 1.1 million-strong
military is the world's fifth largest and the backbone of the
belligerent, Marxist state.
	   On Tuesday, the North's Kye Sun Hui also captured gold in judo,
beating Kim Hye-sook of rival South Korea.
	   But in other events, North Korea has shown signs of decline. Its
once vaunted soccer team, for instance, has made the second round
of the Asian Games competition but suffered a 4-0 loss to
Uzbekistan. FIFA, soccer's governing body, ranks North Korea 181
out of 195 teams, behind such squads as Chad and the Cook Islands.
	   North Korea's women gymnasts also crashed to fifth place in the
team contest Tuesday, beating only last-place Thailand. Some of
squad's tiniest pony-tailed members also looked younger than the
mandatory minimum age of 16.
	   ``They look noticeably young,'' said Jackie Fie, an official
from the gymnastics' governing body, FIG. ``They look 11.''

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with survey predicting harm to industry in 1999 in
 &UR; Survey: Australian minerals industry surviving crisis

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia's minerals industry
continued to withstand the Asian crisis in the three months to
September with exports rising marginally to 10.84 billion
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 6.72 billion).
	   The government's chief commodities forecaster said Wednesday
that export earnings in the minerals and energy sector rose by 97
million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 60 million) in the quarter,
or just under one per cent.
	   But the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics
said imports were also up by 276 million Australian dollars (U.S.
dlrs 171 million), or 12.4 percent, to 2.503 billion Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.55 billion) in the September quarter.
	   ``This strong performance reflected mixed results for minerals
and energy commodities in difficult trading conditions, with strong
increases in earnings in some commodities offsetting significant
falls in other commodities,'' said ABARE director Brian Fisher
	   The biggest rise in export earnings came for crude oil, up 17
percent to 598 million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 371 million).
	   Export earnings also rose for iron ore, steaming coal, aluminum,
liquefied natural gas, refined gold, zinc, and gems.
	   But export earnings fell for iron and steel, nickel, copper,
uranium oxide, petroleum refinery products, lead, and alumina.
	   ``Lower export volumes and unit returns contributed to most of
the falls,'' it said.
	   ``Other commodities to exhibit falls included diamonds,
ferroalloys, magnesia, liquefied petroleum gas, tin, ilmenite and
natural rutile.''
	   Production of uranium soared by 62 percent, manganese by 72
percent, lead by 20 percent, zinc and silver, both by 12 percent,
and natural gas by 5 percent.
	   Refined production of gold spiked upwards by 58 percent in the
quarter joined by a 13 percent rise in production of silver.
	   Production falls were seen for refined tin, refined copper and
diamonds.
	   Separately, the latest Minerals Industry Survey warned on
Wednesday that the Asian economic crisis is set to hit Australia's
minerals exports next year.
	   The 1998 survey, conducted by Pricewaterhouse Coopers, said the
slowing in Asian economic growth did not have a noticeable impact
on the total volume of Australian exports in 1997-98 _ although
there were reduced sales to the affected markets.
	   ``However, the impact of the downturn in Asia is progressively
spreading to these markets and is likely to impact more strongly on
demand for Australian exports next year.''

YBM Magnex heading into receivership because of legal troubles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ YBM Magnex International Inc., a troubled maker
of bicycles and industrial magnets, said it intends to go into
receivership because it likely faces a criminal indictment in the
United States.
	   YBM was a well-regarded member of the Toronto Stock Exchange 300
index and had a market capitalization of almost dlrs 1 billion
eight months ago, before allegations of links to Russian mobsters.
	   In a statement released late Tuesday, the company said its board
of directors had been advised by lawyers that YBM ``is certain to
be indicted by a grand jury in the United States ... and there is
good reason to believe that the U.S. authorities will be able to
marshal substantial credible evidence of criminal wrongdoing.''
	   YBM's head office is in Newtown, Pennsylvania, but it was
founded by Canadian-based entrepreneurs and was traded on the
Toronto and Alberta stock exchanges until its recent woes prompted
a suspension of trading. It has applied to an Alberta court to have
Ernst and Young named receiver and manager.
	   YBM noted that an audit last spring raised concerns about
transactions in Eastern Europe and ``indicated that certain
individuals associated with these entities and certain other
related entities are reputed to have ties with organized crime.''
	   On May 13, YBM's head office in Newtown was searched by the FBI,
the Internal Revenue Service, the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, and the U.S. Customs Office. On the same day, Ontario and
Alberta securities officials halted trading in YBM shares.
	   The statement said parts of YBM's operation, particularly in
Hungary and elsewhere in Eastern Europe, are out of control, and
the board lacks ``the ability to adequately or responsibly
supervise YBM's ongoing business and affairs to ensure that such
business and affairs are lawfully and appropriately conducted.''
	   The statement said the company foresees ``no real likelihood of
the shares of YBM ever resuming trading or for YBM to have access
to financing.''

Chinese police move against more dissidents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ After arresting the organizers of a would-be
opposition party, Chinese police have moved against other members
of the organization agitating for their colleagues' release, rights
groups said Wednesday.
	   Police in southwestern Sichuan province detained three
dissidents in two cities Tuesday. Liu Xianbin, Yu Wanbao and Ouyang
Yi remained in custody Wednesday, the Hong Kong-based Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement reported.
	   At least a dozen members of the China Democracy Party have been
detained over the past 10 days. Although many have been released,
the principal organizers, Xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcai,
are still being held.
	   Authorities are preparing to put Wang on trial next week for
colluding with overseas forces to subvert state power.
	   Liu was a member of a coordinating committee party supporters in
14 provinces and cities set up after the crackdown started last
week, New York-based Human Rights in China reported.
	   He in turn set up an information office with Yu and Ouyang to
draft and fax statements to Chinese officials and dissidents, Human
Rights in China said.
	   In one fax sent Sunday, the dissidents called on the Supreme
People's Court to ensure Wang receives a fair public trial in
Intermediate People's Court in the eastern city of Hangzhou, Human
Rights in China said.
	   Court officials in Hangzhou have again turned down a request by
Wang's wife to be one of his defenders, as allowed by law, at his
trial, set for Dec. 17, the Information Center said.
	   Hu Jiangxia has been trying to put together a defense team, and
although she has found one lawyer, a second lawyer she wanted to
hire was told by police not to take the case, the Information
Center said.

Australia and South Africa angry at Japanese rice tariff plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ South Africa and Australia jointly
attacked Japan on Wednesday over reports that it is planning a
super tariff of up to 1,300 percent on its rice imports.
	   Australia's Trade Minister Tim Fischer was blunt in his
assessment: ``Let me express the strongest possible concern about
those reports emanating from Japan.''
	   South Africa's Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin, who is in
Australia for regular talks between the two countries, quickly
endorsed Fischer's remarks.
	   ``South Africa very much shares that view,'' he said.
	   ``Decisions like this do not make any sense in the world economy
at all,'' Erwin said.
	   Fischer said Australian authorities are urgently checking the
reports, which said the huge tariff would be a strategic measure to
protect Japanese rice farmers ahead of a new round of world
agricultural trade talks.
	   He said Australia had worked hard with other like-minded nations
to secure an 8 percent opening of the Japanese rice market.
	   ``It means 92 percent remains closed,'' he said.
	   ``Now it's not a fair cop if we keep importing without any
quotas, without any percentage restriction, every single
four-wheel-drive Japan wants to send to Australia at a 5 percent
tariff,'' Fischer said.
	   He said this is just one example of Australia's open trade
policies with Japan.
	   He said all tariffs are effectively taxes on the consumers of
Japan, ``And those consumers deserve better.''
	   Australian farmers joined in the general condemnation of the
reported Japanese plan, describing it as a bad omen for next year's
free trade talks planned by the World Trade Organization.
	   ``Such a premature move by Japan would signal a lack of will by
the Japanese to engage in a serious attempt to remove international
trade barriers,'' said the president of Australia's National
Farmers Federation, Ian Donges.

Top military officers reprimanded over accidents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The army and air force chiefs of staff
were officially reprimanded Wednesday for a recent series of
military accidents.
	   Three soldiers were killed and nine people were injured in the
mishaps, which included the firing of an air defense missile into
commercial airspace over the western city of Inchon last Friday.
	   Army Gen. Kim Dong-shin and Air Force Gen. Park Choon-taek were
among 13 military officers reprimanded or punished by Defense
Minister Chun Yong-taek.
	   Two other generals and four lower ranking officers were referred
to disciplinary committees, but the Defense Ministry declined to
reveal their names.
	   Four other officers were relieved of their posts and an army
platoon leader was arrested and charged with failure to properly
supervise his unit.
	   Three civilians were slightly injured when the Nike-Hercules
missile was accidentally launched near Inchon and exploded about
300 meters (900 feet) above the city.
	   A recoilless rifle shell exploded Saturday at a front-line army
barracks, killing three soldiers and wounding five others.
	   And an 83-year-old woman was injured Sunday when a stray flare
shell, fired by a marine unit, fell on her home north of Seoul.
	   President Kim Dae-jung ordered the military to punish the
officers responsible for the accidents on Tuesday. Hours later, two
more soldiers were killed when a hand grenade exploded at a
front-line guard post in eastern South Korea.

Chinese pilot who hijacked own plane indicted in Taiwan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The pilot of a Chinese airliner who
diverted his jet to Taiwan has been indicted on hijacking charges
after the government decided not to send him home to face Chinese
justice, prosecutors said Wednesday.
	   Officials had debated briefly repatriating Yuan Bin, 30, and his
wife Xu Mei, 27, who accompanied him on the flight and was also
charged. That would have broken with standard practice of
prosecuting and imprisoning hijackers in Taiwan.
	   Prosecutors will ask for the minimum penalty of seven years in
prison for the couple because Yuan's motivation for the crime had
been ``relatively harmless,'' said Hsu Ping-wen of the Taoyuan
Prosecutor's Office.
	   Hijacking carries a maximum penalty of death in Taiwan.
	   Yuan said he diverted the Air China Boeing 737-300 off its
scheduled route from Beijing to the southwestern Chinese city of
Kunming on Oct. 28 because he was frustrated over pay and working
conditions at the state-run Chinese carrier.
	   The hijacking ended peacefully when he surrendered and there
were no injuries to any of the 104 people aboard the jet, which was
immediately flown back to China by Yuan's co-pilots.
	   Yuan was also indicted on the lesser charge of illegal entry. Xu
is being prosecuted on the same charges, Hsu said. The couple were
indicted on Tuesday.
	   The issue of repatriating hijackers has been a sticking point
between Taiwan and China as they seek to improve relations.
	   Taiwan used to welcome Chinese hijackers as anti-communist
heroes, but began prosecuting them as tensions lowered and contacts
expanded between the sides in the 1990s.
	   During a rash of air piracies in 1993 and 1994, Taiwan arrested
16 Chinese hijackers and imprisoned them on sentences of up to 12
years. China, which claims sovereignty over Taiwan and refuses to
recognize the island's legal authority, demands hijackers be turned
over to face prosecution at home.
	   The fate of two hijackers who were paroled and sent back to
China last year is unknown and Taiwan has since declined to
repatriate six others after they were released on parole.
	   As a good-will gesture, China sent back a Taiwanese man who
hijacked a Taiwanese jetliner to the mainland last year, and it was
thought that Taiwan might reciprocate the move by returning Yuan
and Xu.

Norman likes International's chances

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Greg Norman didn't play much golf in
1998, but he'll take quality over quantity if the International
team can beat the United States in the Presidents Cup.
	   Norman was one of the prime movers in trying to get the
Presidents Cup, which has been played in the United States twice
previously, to another country. When golf's power brokers chose
Royal Melbourne in his home country of Australia, he couldn't have
been happier.
	   When shoulder surgery seemed the only way out of his recurring
pain and injury, Norman scheduled the surgery in April so that his
recovery time and return to form would coincide with the Presidents
Cup that begins Friday.
	   He doesn't think his surgery layoff will diminish the team's
chances of winning in the match-play format.
	   ``Everybody's expectations for each individual on the team is
very, very high, irrespective of who you are and what you have done
or what has happened in the immediate past,'' Norman said
Wednesday.
	   ``So my expectation for myself is that all I care about is
winning points. I don't care if I shoot 85 and win a point. As long
as you win, that's the important thing.''
	   Norman says although the form charts favor the American players
_ with Tiger Woods, double 1998 major winner Mark O'Meara, U.S.
Open champion Lee Janzen and team mainstay Fred Couple among the 12
_ he rates the International's chances ``fairly highly.''
	   ``No matter how many players you have in the team, you can break
your teams into sections, the same way you can break the U.S. team
into sections,'' Norman said. ``Our team is balanced extremely
well.''
	   Norman says there is strong camaraderie among the players from
the respective nations _ Australia, Fiji, Japan, Paraguay, New
Zealand, South Africa and Zimbabwe.
	   ``We have got a very well-balanced sectional team,'' said
Norman. ``That's why I think, from my perspective, and hearing the
players talk, that I rate our chances very, very highly.''
	   Norman feels Royal Melboure rates about ``nine and a half out of
10.''
	   ``The golf course is perfect,'' he said. ``
	   Norman says the success of the tournament _ nearly 20,000
tickets have been sold for the practice and competition days _
vindicates the decision to take the event outside the U.S.
	   ``I think it's great that the tournament has moved away from the
American shores,'' said Norman. ``And we're fortunate _ it may not
come back to Australia for a long time.
	   ``But given the success of the of the way it has come up, I
think it is going to be high on the priority list for somewhere
down the line again.'' (djp)

Prime Minister shares ``intense disappointment'' over cricket
</HEADLINE>
scandal &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Updates with more reax &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian Prime Minister John Howard
said Wednesday he shared a feeling of intense disappointment with
cricket-loving Australians over the scandal involving Test players
Mark Waugh and Shane Warne.
	   The Australian Cricket Board admitted Tuesday night that in
early 1995 it fined both players a total of Australian dollars
18,000 (U.S. dlrs 11,500) after it was found they accepted money
from an Indian bookmaker.
	   Waugh was fined Australian dollars 10,000 (U.S. dlrs 6,400) and
Warne Australian dollars 8,000 (U.S. dlrs 5,100) in February 1995
for accepting money from an illegal Indian bookmaker in exchange
for weather and pitch reports during the short Sri Lankan tour in
1994.
	   That visit preceded the three-test tour of Pakistan during which
Waugh, Warne and a third Australian player Tim May claimed they
were approached by Pakistani cricketer Salim Malik and offered
money to play poorly.
	   Howard, a big cricket fan, said if the issue had been more
openly dealt with at the time it could have saved Australian
cricket from some of the negative connotations associated with the
scandal.
	   But he believed the issue was best left to cricket authorities
to deal with.
	   ``I would imagine that, given the great passion that Australians
have for cricket, there's an intense feeling of disappointment
about the whole issue,'' Howard told reporters.
	   ``Australians love their cricket and anything that looks as
though it's knocking cricket off its pedestal is something that's
going to deeply disturb Australians.''
	   Former Australian captain Kim Hughes said Shane Warne
involvement in the scandal would damage his chances of ever
captaining Australia.
	   ``It is different to match fixing (but) it is still a shock,''
Hughes said on radio. ``Two blokes who got tremendous records are
now tarnished.
	   ``It's very disappointing for the game.''
	   Hughes said both the ACB and the International Cricket Council
had made matters worse by sweeping the issue under the carpet for
more than three years.
	   Another former Australian skipper agreed.
	   ``One of the most appalling things is that it's been covered up
for so long,'' said Richie Benaud, now a cricket commentator.
	   But Alec Stewart, who on Friday will lead England into the third
test against an Australian team which is expected to include Waugh,
played down the incident.
	   ``To be honest it hasn't affected the game, it's all in the past
... it's nothing to do with English cricket,'' Stewart said.
	   Another former Australian captain, Greg Chappell, also came to
the besieged players' defense.
	   ``It isn't as if they were involved in bribery or fixing games
so I think the ACB handled it appropriately,'' Chappell said.
	   In the national Parliament, Sports Minister Jackie Kelly said
the revelations had led to ``significant disillusionment with two
Aussie icons.''
	   ``It sends a message to all Australian sportsmen that they do
carry the flagship of Australia's reputation, Australia's hopes and
(are) role models for many young kids in Australia who play
sport,'' Kelly said.
	   Gerard Daffy, manager of one of Australia's largest sports
betting agencies, said the information the Australian players
claimed to have given the Indian bookmaker was vastly overpriced.
	   ``The Indian bookie could have rung his local weather bureau for
80 cents and got the same information ... that's what we do 10 or
15 times a week,'' he said.

NATO and Russia seek better cooperation in 1999
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Meeting scheduled to begin at 3 a.m. EST. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Political and military ties ranging
from arms control to NATO aid in retraining Russian officers for
civilian life are part of a common agenda for 1999 sought by NATO
and Russia.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and his 16 NATO
counterparts, sitting down today to map out plans for the year
ahead, are keen to signal their intent to enter the New Year with a
renewed spirit of cooperation.
	   Russia has agreed to allow NATO experts to investigate how the
2000 computer problem could affect Russia's defense systems. NATO
officials dismissed stories that the so-called millennium bug could
cause Moscow's nuclear arms to go haywire, but they want to share
expertise with Russia to avoid such things as the malfunctioning of
air-traffic control and early-warning systems.
	   Today's meeting follows a rough year, marred by conflicting
views on what should be done to defuse the violence in Kosovo,
Yugoslavia's separatist Serbian province.
	   Russia persistently opposed allied plans for airstrikes against
the Serbs if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic did not comply
with Western demands to cut back security forces in Kosovo.
	   Relations improved after a cease-fire was negotiated. Moscow has
indicated it is willing to take part in NATO's air surveillance
mission over the province. That issue was to be discussed today,
although Russia has yet to make a formal proposal.
	   The NATO foreign ministers also were to brief Russia on their
talks Tuesday on updating the alliance's strategy for the 21st
century.
	   Allied ministers laid the groundwork for the 50th anniversary
NATO summit in April in Washington. The summit will welcome Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic as new members, over Russia's
objections.
	   The leaders also were expected to approve the revamped strategy
that should shift the focus from defending Western Europe from a
frontal assault to dealing with challenges from regional conflicts,
ethnic violence, terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said NATO must be
prepared to take action beyond its borders.
	   ``We agree that though the threats to our security and interests
have changed, the need for vigilance, vision and unity has not,''
Albright said at a news conference Tuesday.
	   ``Instability that is dangerous and contagious is best stopped
before it reaches NATO's borders.''

Events leading up to revelations of bookmaker payments to two
</HEADLINE>
Australian cricketers &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The following is a chronology of events
surrounding Australian test cricket players Mark Waugh and Shane
Warne's involvement in a betting scandal:
	   September, 1994 _ During a short tour of Sri Lanka, Mark Waugh
is paid Australian dollars 6,000 (U.S. dlrs 3,800) and Shane Warne
Australian dollars 5,000 (U.S. dlrs 3,200) by an Indian bookmaker
for information before the team's one-day games.
	   October, 1994 _ Australia tours Pakistan, during which time
Waugh, Warne and Tim May later allege they were offered U.S. dlrs
200,000 each by Pakistani captain Salim Malik to play badly.
	   February, 1995 _ Allegations that Malik attempted to bribe
Australian players are made public for the first time.
	   February, 1995 _ The Australian Cricket Board secretly fines
Waugh Australian dollars 10,000 (U.S. dlrs 6,400) and Warne
Australian dollars 8,000 (U.S. dlrs 5,100) after being told of
their payments to the bookmaker.
	   1995 _ The ACB asks the International Cricket Council at a
meeting in Sydney to keep the bookmaker fines secret. The ICC
agrees.
	   Oct. 7, 1998 _ In Lahore, Pakistan, Waugh and captain Mark
Taylor give key evidence in secret to Pakistan's judicial inquiry
into alleged match-fixing by Pakistani players.
	   Dec. 8, 1998 _ The scandal of the Waugh and Warne payments to
the bookmaker is made public.
	   Dec. 9, 1998 _ Waugh and Warne say they were naive and stupid
for accepting money. Former ACB chairman Alan Crompton says the
matter was kept secret for three years because it was regarded as
an internal disciplinary matter.

Spacewalk II _ astronauts prepare for second construction job

	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ Astronauts Jerry Ross and James
Newman have a spacewalk sequel today, as the crew of the shuttle
Endeavour returns to work building the international space station.
	   Ross and Newman spent 7{ hours in space Monday, connecting 40
electrical and data cables that enabled the American-made Unity
chamber to be powered up for the first time.
	   During the seven-hour outing planned for today, Ross and Newman
were to attach two 100-pound antennas to each side of Unity. The
antennas will allow the crew to communicate with their colleagues
on Earth after entering the space station for the first time on
Thursday.
	   ``I think we're all going to be pumped up when we actually go
inside the space station,'' shuttle commander Robert Cabana said
Tuesday.
	   Besides connecting Unity's antennas, Ross and Newman also were
to try to unfurl at least one of two jammed antennas on the
Russian-built Zarya control module. The antennas must be rolled
open for Zarya's backup docking system to work.
	   NASA and Russian flight controllers have given preliminary
approval to the idea; a final decision was expected before the
spacewalk begins.
	   A third and final spacewalk _ to stow tool boxes for future
assembly crews _ is set for Saturday.
	   Zarya and Unity, the first two pieces of the space station, were
connected on Sunday on top of Endeavour's cargo bay. Forming a
seven-story, 35-ton tower, the attached components will be released
into orbit before the shuttle returns home next Tuesday.
	   NASA estimates 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks will be
needed to assemble the entire outpost, scheduled for completion in
2004.
	   With the bulk of their construction work behind them,
Endeavour's astronauts gave the space station a safe but shaky lift
to a higher orbit on Tuesday. The pilots fired the shuttle
thrusters to climb to an altitude of 248 miles, 5{ miles higher
than before.
	   NASA wants to leave the space station in as high an orbit as
possible. Spacecraft gradually sink and need to be boosted
periodically.
	   The astronauts also enjoyed some time off while flight
controllers continued powering up Unity. In preparation for the
first visit from the crew, the module's cabin fan and smoke
detectors were activated.
	   The heaters also were adjusted so the 36-foot cylinder will be
warm enough when the five American astronauts and one Russian
venture inside.
	   Flight controllers ``are very excited to see it coming to life _
to see the data flowing, to see things actually working the way
they were designed,'' said Frank Culbertson, NASA's deputy program
manager for space station operations.
	   ``It's still attached to the shuttle and we still have work to
do,'' Culbertson said. ``But we know when the shuttle leaves that
it'll work and it'll be the basis for what comes.''

Sri Lanka's Jayasinghe running fever, may not run
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Sprinter Susantika Jayasinghe is
running a fever, raising doubts about whether she will be fit
before track and field competition starts Sunday at the Asian
Games, Sri Lankan sports officials said.
	   ``Doctors are checking her, so nothing can be said definitively
at this moment,'' a Sri Lankan official told The Associated Press
Wednesday.
	   ``She is running a fever and feeling generally weak. This is not
a good sign,'' said the official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Jayasinghe has been looking forward to the Bangkok games to
resume her athletic career after being dogged by drug questions.
	   The 23-year-old sprinter tested positive for Nandralone-19 after
she won the silver in her favorite 200 meters at the Athens track
championships last year. The Sri Lankan Amateur Athletic
Association cleared her in a 2-1 verdict, but the International
Amateur Athletic Federation, track and field's world governing
body, referred her case to arbitration in November.
	   Jayasinghe says she only took a drug to control her menstrual
cycle. She claimed she was set up by frustrated Sri Lankan sports
officials and government ministers after she resisted their amorous
advances.
	   Jayasinghe is Sri Lanka's best hope in the 100- and 200-meter
races in Bangkok.

Prosecutors question Suharto about corruption allegations
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with end of questioning; ADDS details thruout &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Protected by a massive security
clampdown, former President Suharto was questioned by state
prosecutors for four hours Wednesday over corruption allegations
during his 32-year authoritarian rule.
	   The 77-year-old retired army general, who quit office after
student protests and deadly riots six months ago, smiled but looked
tired when he emerged from the Jakarta High Attorney's office.
	   He was accompanied by eight lawyers.
	   Speaking briefly to reporters outside, he said he would continue
to cooperate with the prosecutors.
	   But he said it would be inappropriate for him to answer
reporters' questions while his case was still being investigated.
	   ``No one is above the law, because our country is based on
law,'' he said. ``But every citizen has the right to be protected
by the law.''
	   One of his lawyers said the ex-president had answered dozens of
questions. They related to multi-million dollar charitable
foundations formerly under his control, a national car project run
by one of his sons with massive tax breaks, the contents of his
banks accounts and presidential decrees that allegedly benefited
his family and friends.
	   The lawyer said Suharto was granted about a one hour rest during
the questioning.
	   Suharto's opponents and student protesters accuse him of abusing
his power and plundering Indonesia's national resources to amass
fortunes for himself, his family and a clique of cronies.
	   Forbes magazine this year estimated his wealth was dlrs 4
billion. Others say it is much higher.
	   Previously Suharto has denied any wrongdoing and has repeatedly
scoffed at accusations that he has stashed billions of dollars in
overseas bank accounts.
	   It was the third time since his resignation that Suharto has
been questioned by state lawyers.
	   Suharto was quizzed Wednesday after the government bowed to
demands for a new inquiry into his wealth. Students staged protests
for weeks demanding he be put on trial for corruption and human
rights abuses.
	   Critics said an earlier probe was a whitewash. Under pressure,
Suharto's successor and one-time protege, President B.J. Habibie,
ordered Attorney General Andi Mohammad Ghalib to question Suharto
again.
	   Suharto smiled and waved at staff members when he arrived in a
Mercedes jeep at the prosecutor's office, which was heavily guarded
by riot police.
	   Several small tanks were parked nearby but there was no sign of
student protesters.
	   Suharto arrived early in the morning and police closed major
roads in central Jakarta causing rush hour traffic chaos in the
already congested city of 11 million people. Security was also
stepped up around the presidential palace and other strategic
locations.
	   The state-run television network broadcast live reports from the
scene.
	   Many had expected Suharto to appear at the Attorney General's
office in another part of Jakarta.
	   The change of venue to the Jakarta prosecutors' office was
apparently a ruse designed to foil students who have frequently
staged protests at Ghalib's office and occupied it for one day last
month.
	   The students helped force him out of power in May amid political
turmoil and hardship caused by the worst economic crisis in decades
in the Southeast Asian nation of 202 million people.
	   About 300 people had gathered at Ghalib's office on Wednesday.
Many said they were disappointed not to have seen the former
autocrat. Some shouted anti-Suharto slogans and held up protest
banners.
	   Suharto, now a virtual recluse in his Jakarta home, was
accompanied to the prosecutor's office by several men, including
his legal team. The former president wore traditional Indonesian
clothing that he often appeared in while in office: a batik shirt
and a black cap.
	   A spokesman for the attorney general said Suharto had been
questioned over his patronage of a number of charitable foundations
that prosecutors allege were actually being run as businesses with
government support and tax relief.
	   Last month Suharto handed over control of seven foundations,
worth dlrs 530 million, to the government.
	   The spokesman said the old leader had been asked about his role
in a so-called ``national car'' project, through which Suharto's
son, Hutomo ``Tommy'' Mandala Putra, was licensed to import cars
from Korea's Kia Motors Corp. without having to pay billions of
dollars in import tariffs like other car companies.
	   Critics claimed the project contravened basic international
trade rules.

Oman's coach finds justice in victory over old employer, Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Savoring a 4-2 upset over heavily
favored Iran, Oman's Brazilian soccer coach says he found a measure
of justice in leading the defeat of his old employer.
	   Valdeir Vieira, who was replaced by Iran last year, organized
his underdog side in shutting down the potent Iranian offense in a
second-round group match Tuesday in the Asian Games.
	   ``The feeling is one of justice, yes,'' Vieira said. ``To beat
this Iranian side is very special. Iran is a better team than we
are, but we played as a team. It was just teamwork.''
	   Oman took control of the Gulf grudge match before the half when
an own goal by Iran's captain, Mohammad Khani Nader, made it 2-1.
	   Omani striker Hani al-Dhabit, scoring his fourth Asian Games
goal, and Salim Radhwan put the match out of reach for Iran, which
brought most of its World Cup side to the regional event.
	   Bayern Munchen star Ali Daei scored his second goal of the games
and Vahid Hashemian Korbi his third for Iran.
	   The upset puts the Iranians, heavily favored to win the soccer
gold, under intense pressure to win their next two group games
against Tajikistan and another favorite, China.
	   But Vieira, whose side now scents the chance for advancing to
the quarterfinals, is also under pressure, facing an undefeated but
largely experimental Chinese side Thursday.
	   ``After all the extra-normal effort against Iran, I don't know
if I can get the team ready,'' Vieira admitted. ``China is much
quicker than Iran, and we don't have that many alternatives.''
	   Iran and China clash Saturday in what could be the determining
match to see which two sides advance from the four-team group.
	   Tajikistan saw an own goal by captain Takhirdjon Muminov put
Tuesday's group opener out of reach, with China winning, 3-1.

Ex-POWs seek public backing in compensation claim against Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British soldiers held prisoner in Japan during
World War II launched a national appeal Wednesday for public
support in their continuing fight for compensation and an apology.
	   The British prisoners of war, who lost a fight in a Tokyo court
last month for compensation from the Japanese government, took out
a series of advertisements in British newspapers asking supporters
to send a Christmas card to the Japanese ambassador in London ''as
a peaceful signal of solidarity with this just cause.''
	   The advertisements also encouraged the public to write to
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook to encourage the government to lodge a
formal compensation claim.
	   British veterans were among a group of seven former World War II
POWs who filed legal claims in 1995. The claims were filed on
behalf of 20,000 members of veteran and civilian ex-prisoner
organizations from Britain, the United States, Australia and New
Zealand.
	   The plaintiffs demanded dlrs 22,000 each for what they claimed
were violations of their rights under international treaties and
conventions on the treatment of war prisoners. The total claim was
for dlrs 440 million.
	   The Tokyo court ruled against them last month. Presiding Judge
Shigeki Inoue said in his verdict that the issue was resolved in
1951 with the signing of the San Francisco peace treaty. He said
compensation issues must be dealt with on a
government-to-government level.
	   The British government has also cited the 1951 postwar treaty in
not filing a formal claim on behalf of the veterans. The POWs have
lodged an appeal in Japan.
	   ''It is time for the British government to get behind them
rather than leaving them to fight the Japanese on their own,'' said
Martyn Day, the lawyer representing the British POWs.
	   During World War II, Japan forced POWs to work in shipyards,
mines and jungles in violation of international law. They were also
beaten and some were executed. The POW death rate at the Japanese
camps was 27 percent, compared to a 4 percent rate at Allied camps.

Belarusian journalist receives press freedom award

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ A Belarusian journalist received a press
freedom award in Minsk from the Committee to Protect Journalists,
after the government barred him from traveling to New York to
accept the honor.
	   Officials with the New York-based CPJ, including director Ann
Cooper, flew to Belarus to give Pavel Sheremet the International
Press Freedom Award in person on Tuesday.
	   ``We came here to show our personal support and solidarity with
Pavel Sheremet and all Belarusian journalists who continue to
perform their professional duties in such difficult conditions,''
said Chrystina Lapychak, program coordinator for Eastern Europe.
	   Sheremet, Minsk bureau chief for Russia's ORT television and
chief editor of the newspaper Belarusskaya Delovaya Gazeta, was
selected ``for his great courage and ability to defend his rights
despite constant persecution,'' she said.
	   Sheremet has endured arrest and imprisonment while covering the
increasingly strict government in this former Soviet republic.
	   Belarus' visa department refused him an exit visa to attend the
Nov. 24 CPJ award ceremony in New York, citing orders from the
administration of President Alexander Lukashenko.
	   Belarusian citizens still need an exit visa to leave the
country, a practice left over from Soviet times that has been
abolished in most other former Soviet republics.
	   ``A couple of years ago fear prevented us from struggling for a
normal, human life,'' Sheremet said in his acceptance speech in
Minsk's central Hotel Yubileinaya.
	   ``Belarus is viewed in the world as a country of dictatorship
... but I am sure that in several years Belarus will be viewed as a
normal country, where nobody will be able to impose on the people
the (Soviet-style) system the entire world has already abandoned.''
	   Lukashenko has ranked among the top 10 world leaders suppressing
independent media in CPJ polls for the past three years, Cooper
said.
	   Lukashenko frequently has complained about Russian news coverage
of his country, and has claimed on several occasions that Sheremet
and other journalists were trying to harm Belarus' image.
	   Despite protests by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and human
rights activists, Belarusian authorities held Sheremet in jail for
2{ months and then gave him a two-year suspended sentence for a
report on Belarus' lax border controls.

Australia, South Africa angry at Japanese rice tariff plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ South Africa and Australia jointly
criticized Japan on Wednesday over reports that it is planning a
super tariff of up to 1,300 percent on its rice imports.
	   ``Let me express the strongest possible concern about those
reports emanating from Japan,'' said Tim Fischer, Australia's Trade
Minister.
	   South Africa's Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin, who is in
Australia for regular talks between the two countries, quickly
endorsed Fischer's remarks.
	   ``South Africa very much shares that view,'' he said.
	   ``Decisions like this do not make any sense in the world economy
at all,'' Erwin said.
	   Fischer said Australian authorities are urgently checking the
reports, which said the huge tariff would be a strategic measure to
protect Japanese rice farmers ahead of a new round of world
agricultural trade talks.
	   He said Australia had worked hard with other like-minded nations
to secure an 8 percent opening of the Japanese rice market.
	   ``It means 92 percent remains closed,'' he said.
	   ``Now it's not a fair cop if we keep importing without any
quotas, without any percentage restriction, every single
four-wheel-drive Japan wants to send to Australia at a 5 percent
tariff,'' Fischer said.
	   He said this is just one example of Australia's open trade
policies with Japan.
	   He said all tariffs are effectively taxes on the consumers of
Japan, ``And those consumers deserve better.''
	   Australian farmers joined in the general condemnation of the
reported Japanese plan, describing it as a bad omen for next year's
free trade talks planned by the World Trade Organization.
	   ``Such a premature move by Japan would signal a lack of will by
the Japanese to engage in a serious attempt to remove international
trade barriers,'' said the president of Australia's National
Farmers Federation, Ian Donges.

Chen Yan too sick to tackle 400-meter freestyle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ World champion Chen Yan was too sick to
compete in the 400-meter freestyle at the Asian Games Tuesday,
continuing the bleak news for the world swim power.
	   Chen, who won the event along with the 400-meter medley at this
year's world championships in Perth, remains ill with a stomach
ailment, according to team officials. Medley world record holder
Chen trailed off badly to finish third in that event Monday and
missed Tuesday's 200 freestyle because of diarrhea.
	   Chen also failed to show up for the heats of the 400 freestyle
Wednesday. She would have been the clear favorite. China's Chen Hua
was the fastest qualifier for the 400 freestyle finals.
	   China won 25 of 32 golds four years ago in Hiroshima but trails
Japan 6-3 after 10 swimming finals here. It went without a gold

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The All-Star game is the latest casualty of the
National Basketball Association lockout. The only thing left to
save is the season itself.
	   Ending a 47-year-old tradition of bringing its top talent
together for a special showcase, the NBA on Tuesday canceled the
All-Star game, which had been set for Feb. 14 in Philadelphia. It
said the league's showcast spectacle would return to the city in
2002.
	   ``This is just a result of the inexorable march of the
calendar,'' commissioner David Stern said. ``There just isn't
enough time left to have a season with an All-Star game.''
	   The 2000 All-Star game has been awarded to the Golden State
Warriors, and the 2001 game is expected to go to the Washington
Wizards. But Stern promised it would be back in Philadelphia the
following year.
	   ``We apologize to the city of Philadelphia,'' Stern said. ``We
promise you'll get a first-class All-Star experience in 2002.''

Judge decides to wait on Tyson probation action

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ A decision on whether Mike Tyson's probation
will be revoked is being delayed until after his first fight in
more than 17 months.
	   Judge Patricia Gifford on Tuesday put off the decision until he
is sentenced in Maryland, which is expected on Feb. 5. Gifford
received a report from probation officer George Walker, who noted
Tyson had avoided trouble with the law until the charges that he
kicked and punched two men following a traffic accident last
August.
	   Tyson plans to fight Francois Botha on Jan. 16. During a Los
Angeles news conference Tuesday about the fight, a reporter asked
Tyson how he felt about a possible return to prison. Tyson did not
answer the question.
	   The probation report on the former heavyweight champion
describes him as a man who cooperated with authorities and lived up
to all terms of his early release from prison until a recent
scuffle with two motorists in Maryland.
	   Now it's up to Gifford to decide whether Tyson's no-contest plea
to second-degree misdemeanor assault charges is sufficient grounds
to put him back behind bars.
	   In the one-page report, Walker said it ``may be desirable to
await the outcome'' of the Maryland case, and he noted that Tyson
had completed more than 3 1/2 years of his four years of probation
``with no criminal arrests, and he has been otherwise compliant and
cooperative with this officer.''
	   Tyson originally was sentenced to 10 years for raping a beauty
pageant contestant in an Indianapolis hotel room in 1991. Four
years were suspended, and Tyson served half of the remaining six
years _ with three years off for good behavior _ before he was
released in March 1995. Gifford put him on four years' probation,
which is scheduled to expire in March.
	   ``Our position, clearly, would be that he's almost at the end of
his probationary period, he's complied with all terms and
conditions of probation up to this point,'' said Tyson lawyer James
Voyles.
	   But what happens there could affect Gifford's decision later,
Voyles said.
	   ``A probation violation can occur by merely having an arrest. So
the court has a number of options, and the probation officer has a
number of options, and so they'll look at it very carefully and
make whatever decision they think is appropriate,'' Voyles said.
	   In Tuesday's report to Gifford, Walker also noted that Tyson has
completed more than the required community service, completed a
special counseling program for sex offenders and continues weekly
counseling, all of which could work in his favor, Walker said.
	   ``That's what we always hope for, that the person is compliant
throughout the probation,'' he said. ``Four years is a pretty good
time to be on probation, and to get through 3 1/2 doing well is a
pretty good accomplishment.
	   Walker said he still has to research Tyson's no-contest plea,
which does not exist in Indiana law.
	   Gifford, who declined comment on Tuesday, could have issued a
warrant for Tyson's arrest or ordered an immediate hearing on the
report from Walker.
	   Indiana authorities also reviewed the probation _ but took no
action _ after Tyson bit Evander Holyfield's ears during a title
bout in June 1997. The Nevada Athletic Commission stripped Tyson of
his boxing license, but reinstated him in October.
	   Tyson's no-contest plea was not an admission of guilt. However,
Tyson could face up to 20 years in prison _ 10 years on each count
_ and be fined up to dlrs 5,000. The two men he scuffled with
already have agreed to a settlement to avoid a civil suit.
	   Tyson is training in the Phoenix area and intends to live there.
He already has registered as a sex offender in Arizona as part of
his planned move.

Ex-insurance saleswoman arrested in poisoned curry case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Police arrested a woman Wednesday in a
mass-poisoning case in which arsenic-laced curry killed four people
and sickened dozens of others at a summer festival, local media
reported.
	   Former insurance saleswoman Masumi Hayashi was charged with
murder and attempted murder for allegedly slipping arsenic into a
pot of curry served at a festival in the southwestern city of
Wakayama, Kyodo News reported.
	   Two children died in the July 25 poisoning, which shook the
nation and was followed by a rash of apparent copy-cat poisonings.
A total of 63 people were sickened by the curry.
	   Hayashi had earlier been charged with allegedly serving
arsenic-laced meals to her 53-year-old husband Kenji and another
man on several occasions in 1997 in an attempt to obtain their life
insurance money.
	   Kenji has been charged in the earlier case with insurance fraud.
	   Local media had been speculating for months that Hayashi may
have been behind the curry poisoning, but police have reportedly
found little more than circumstantial evidence connecting her with
the murders.
	   Investigators have found arsenic under a sink in Hayashi's home
and in about 10 other spots on her property in Wakayama, about 450
kilometers (280 miles) southwest of Tokyo.
	   The Hayashis had been under police scrutiny for years, partly
because Kenji ran a termite extermination company that gave him
access to poisonous chemicals.
	   The couple have denied all charges brought against them.
	   Police suspect Masumi poisoned the curry to obtain some 542
million yen (dlrs 4.5 million) in life insurance she had taken out
on five people who had taken part in gambling sessions at her home,
Kyodo News reported.
	   Police say Hayashi allegedly tried to kill her husband to
receive some 110 million yen (dlrs 920,000) in life insurance that
she had secretly taken out on him.
	   The curry case has received massive media coverage all week as
word leaked out that Hayashi's arrest was imminent. Japan's
national broadcaster NHK devoted the first 30 minutes of its noon
news broadcast Wednesday to the expected arrest.
	   The poisoned curry case was followed by a series of apparent
copycat poisonings elsewhere in Japan, including the death of a man
who drank a can of tea laced with cyanide.
	   The string of poisonings has struck a chord in a country where
memories of the Aum Shinrikyo religious cult's 1995 subway nerve
gas assault that killed 12 in Tokyo are still fresh.
	   The attacks also have come as the nation is grappling with a
growing crime rate, a jump in juvenile delinquency and general
malaise related to the economy, now in its worst recession since
World War II.

Thais urge Swedes to find replacement for chimp they want freed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Foreign Ministry is urging
Swedish animal rights activists to find a replacement chimpanzee
for one they want freed from a Bangkok zoo, a ministry spokesman
said on Wednesday.
	   Swedish activists are threatening a tourism boycott campaign
against Thailand because they want Safari World, a privately-owned
zoo, to release Ola, a 12-year-old male chimpanzee who once
performed on stage in Stockholm and is the subject of a children's
book.
	   The activists have raised dlrs 50,000 to buy Ola and send him to
a sanctuary for chimpanzees in Zambia. They say he is being
mistreated because he has been kept in a 14-square-meter
(17-square-yard) cage with three female chimpanzees for nearly
three years in an attempt to get him to breed.
	   Last week, a Swedish couple who once cared for Ola, and a
television crew, said they were surrounded by armed guards and
ejected from Safari World when they tried to film Ola for a
documentary.
	   ``If he is not being mistreated, then why are they afraid to let
us take pictures of him,'' said Louise Tillberg, the woman who
cared for Ola.
	   Kitti Waseenon, the deputy spokesman for Thailand's Foreign
Ministry, said the ministry and the Thai Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals agreed that Ola's conditions at Safari World
were acceptable.
	   ``Of course, standards in these situations are relative,'' he
said, noting that Westerners look upon caging animals differently
than many people in developing countries.
	   Kitti said the ministry would ask Swedish activists to find a
replacement for Ola because Safari World's owner had obtained him
legally from a Swedish zoo, and didn't want to take money and be
accused of selling animals.
	   The owner also still wants to have a male to breed.
	   Kitti said he would meet with Swedish embassy officials in
Bangkok on Friday to ask for their support. They had been lobbying
for the Thais to sell Ola to the activists and be sent to Zambia.
	   Thailand's embassy in Stockholm will also meet with Swedish
authorities and activists to try and get them to go along with the
plan, Kitti said.
	   But Swedish activists have already said they are unwilling to
subject another chimpanzee to Safari World's conditions, and want
Ola sold unconditionally.
	   Roger Lohanon of the TSPCA said the best solution would be to
find a young chimpanzee rescued from illegal animal traders, who
had been kept in a tiny cage, and give him to Safari World as Ola's
replacement.
	   That way, Lohanon said, the rescued chimpanzee would actually be
put in a better situation than he had been in.

 &UR; Defense lawyers undecided over impeachment

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Lawyers defending jailed
politician Anwar Ibrahim appeared confused Wednesday when
confronted by the judge about their intention to launch separate
proceedings to prove a key prosecution witness was lying.
	   The lawyers were stumped when Judge Augustine Paul told them if
they wished to impeach the witness, they should stop
cross-examining him and try to prove instead that he was lying.
	   ``It appears illogical to obtain all the answers and then
conduct the impeachment,'' Paul told defense counsel Gurbachan
Singh. ``That's legally untenable.''
	   Gurbachan was questioning Azizan Abu Bakar, who testified last
week that Anwar made him a ``homosexual slave'' while he was a
driver for Anwar's wife in 1992.
	   When Azizan appeared to contradict himself on Monday by saying
he never had sex with Anwar, defense lawyers began discussing the
possibility of launching separate proceedings to prove the witness
was lying under oath. On Tuesday, they mentioned their intention to
the judge but continued to grill Azizan.
	   Anwar is being tried now for four counts of corruption. He will
face trial at a later date for one more charge of corruption and
five of illegal sex acts.
	   Azizan's accusations against Anwar form the bulk of the charges.
	   In response to Paul's query, Gurbachan said: ``I am in a
dilemma.'' The defense team then asked for an adjournment to
discuss the matter. The judge offered them a book he had authored
on impeaching witnesses so that the lawyers could read the rules.
	   Mahathir fired Anwar on Sept. 2, accusing him of being morally
unfit for office. The sacking led to demands for political reforms
and massive anti-government protests in the normally placid
Southeast Asian capital.

ACB in difficult position over coverup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ For four years the Pakistan Cricket
Board has been criticized for its handling of allegations that some
of its players were involved in bribes and match fixing.
	   One of the loudest and harshest critics was the Australian
Cricket Board, which now finds itself trying to explain its own
coverup of suppressing details of the involvement of Mark Waugh and
Shane Warne with Indian bookmakers.
	   A Pakistan probe into match-fixing allegations against Salim
Malik took direct evidence from Waugh, corroborated by affidavits
from Warne and Tim May, that they were offered bribes by Salim
Malik on the 1994 tour.
	   Waugh's evidence to high court judge Malik Mohammad Qayyum _
which had been described as ``critical'' by Pakistan Cricket Board
lawyer Ali Sibtain Fazli _ may now be considered tainted.
	   When Waugh agreed to appear before Justice Qayyum in September
he reiterated the allegations he had leveled in a sworn affidavit
put to a 1995
	   inquiry before a different Pakistani judge.
	   That judge dismissed the affidavits and branded the three
Australians liars.
	   With the latest developments Fazli believes there may be a
different view
	   of Waugh's evidence.
	   ``Now with Mark Waugh's own character - there's a big dent which
has been put in his own credibility,'' Fazli said.
	   ``Mark Waugh and (Mark) Taylor should've made some mention of it
because they were made to give statements on oath. There should
have been disclosures
	   then.''
	   Details of the in-camera court appearance have not been released
but could be made public when Justice Qayyum presents his findings
later this month.
	   Australia's cricketers have long been considered amongst the
fairest, but that image may now be tarnished for good.
	   Waugh and Taylor were the only Australians to give direct
evidence against Malik although Taylor's role was to simply tell
Justice Qayyum about the reporting of the incident to officials.
	   It left Waugh's testimony as the only direct evidence from one
of the three Malik accusers. Warne and Tim May refused to travel to
Pakistan to front the commission.
	   ACB chief executive Malcolm Speed, who flew to Pakistan to
address the bribery issue, sought safety assurances and insisted on
the appearance being strictly in-camera and involve no one but
themselves, a team security officer
	   and the judge.
	   The four had even kept details of the hearing from the rest of
the team, but were unable to hide it from the Pakistan press. (djp)

Japanese stocks close higher, dollar lower against yen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with closing stocks, mid-afternoon dollar,
bond

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Stock prices finished higher Wednesday following a
late rise in futures prices. The U.S. dollar slipped against the
yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 123.70 points,
or 0.84 percent, to close the day at 14931.90. On Tuesday, the
Nikkei gained 84.71 points, or 0.58 percent.
	   The dollar bought 118.76 yen, down 1.10 yen from late Tuesday in
Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 119.31 yen
overnight.
	   Share prices closed higher for the third day in a row as
investors covered short, or oversold, futures positions in the last
hour of trading, analysts said.
	   Japanese share prices had been trading lower for most of the
session, pushed down by an overnight fall in U.S. stocks. In New
York, the Dow Jones industrial average ended at 9,027.98, down
42.49 points.
	   In Tokyo, many investors took to the sidelines ahead of Friday's
settlement of December futures and options, when a surge in trading
may cause share prices to swing unpredictably.
	   Participants also turned cautious as they awaited the release
Monday of the Bank of Japan's closely-watched quarterly ``tankan''
business confidence survey.
	   But Parliament's swift approval of a 5.7 trillion yen (dlrs 48
billion) supplementary budget Tuesday evening cushioned the
market's fall earlier in the day, traders said.
	   The extra budget will help fund the 24 trillion yen (dlrs 200
billion) economic stimulus package that the government unveiled
last month.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 8.75 points, or 0.77 percent, to 1,140.74. The
TOPIX rose 6.99 points, or 0.62 percent, the previous day.
	   On the foreign exchange market, dollar-buying sentiment was
dampened early in the morning by the weakness on Wall Street as
well as lingering worries over the outlook for the U.S. and Latin
American economies, traders said.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.110 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.050 percent,
driving its price down to 105.92 yen from 106.47 yen.

Club promises thorough sign-stealing scandal investigation by next
</HEADLINE>
week &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Japanese baseball club accused of using a TV
monitor, walkie-talkies and a megaphone in the stands to steal
signs said Wednesday it was about halfway through with its
investigation and will make the results public next week.
	   ``We have not yet reached a conclusion. We are in the middle of
the investigation,'' said Yasuharu Kishitani, general manager of
the Fukuoka-based Daiei Hawks.
	   The allegations of the elaborate sign-stealing scheme, which
surfaced last week, have dominated sports news here. It has
especially riveted baseball fans because all-time home run king
Sadaharu Oh is the Hawks' manager.
	   Oh, who hit a record 868 home runs and is a sure future Japanese
Hall of Famer, has said that he fears he may face a lifetime ban if
the team is found to be behind the scam.
	   According to the charges, a Daiei team employee monitored a TV
camera in Fukuoka Dome that was focused on the opposing catcher.
The employee picked up signs given to the pitcher and relayed them
by walkie-talkie to a youngster in the stands who then relayed
information to the batter by using a megaphone.
	   Holding the megaphone in front of his face meant a fastball.
Holding it to the right meant a curve or a slider, and to the left
a forkball.
	   Kishitani refused to give any specifics of the investigation but
promised to give a final report by next Tuesday.
	   A special committee set up by the team has been questioning
``the parties involved'' every day for the past week from 7:30 in
the morning until 11 at night, he said.
	   The scandal is a tragic blight on Oh's spectacular
rags-to-riches career. Even if the investigation finds him
innocent, Oh may have to step down as manager. In Japan, people in
positions of power often resign to take responsibility for
scandals.
	   The story of Oh, a Taiwanese born in Japan, who grew up as a son
of a poor noodle-shop owner and went on to become a star, has long
been part of Japanese baseball lore.
	   Oh, who has a reputation for impeccable character, originated
his own batting style dubbed ``ippon-ashi-daho,'' or ``one-legged
batting,'' for the way he stood on one leg at the plate before his
swing.
	   Pacific League Chairman Kazuo Harano, who met with Kishitani
Wednesday in the company of other league officials, said he was
satisfied with the progress of Daiei's investigation. But he
acknowledged the league may have to carry out a separate
investigation.
	   ``Daiei is doing their best, and I believe that,'' Harano told
reporters.
	   Sign-stealing is as common as it is frowned upon in Japanese
baseball, much as in American baseball. But the alleged Daiei
scheme is so blatant that, if proved true, stiff penalties,
including a possible lifetime ban, are expected.
	   Daiei has said that the three players accused in the scandal
have denied wrongdoing.

Iran says US recognition of its anti-drugs campaign is belated
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision to
remove Iran from its list of drug-problem countries was long
overdue, Iran's foreign minister said in remarks published
Wednesday.
	   ``The recognition by the U.S. is late. Iran has been considered
a champion in drug fighting for many years and the U.S. has
accepted this fact now,'' Kamal Kharrazi was quoted as saying by
the Tehran Times.
	   Iran spends dlrs 400 million a year in its fight against drugs
and has played a crucial role in preventing narcotics from reaching
other countries, including Europe, Kharrazi said in the report.
	   Iranian television reported Kharrazi as saying 2,350 Iranians
had died in the fight against drugs. The minister was apparently
referring to anti-narcotics agents that had died in clashes with
smugglers, but he did not give a time frame for the figure.
	   Kharrazi's comments were the first by an Iranian official since
President Clinton announced Monday that he was removing Iran from
the U.S. list of countries deemed to be lax on drugs.
	   Clinton made the decision despite objections from Republican
Party members of Congress, who had maintained there was no basis
for believing that Iran was taking a tougher line on drugs.
	   But in a letter to Congress, Clinton said that Iran is no longer
a significant producer of opium poppy, the raw material for heroin,
and that it has ceased to be a major transit point for U.S.-bound
illicit drugs.
	   Iran has been cracking down on drug smugglers since 1988.
Hundreds of traffickers have been hanged under a law that mandates
the death penalty for anyone caught with more than a small quantity
of narcotics.
	   Large drug hauls are common in Iran, which lies on a route used
by smugglers to carry drugs from Pakistan and Afghanistan to Europe
and the oil-rich Gulf.
	   Tehran has also mounted a vigorous campaign to rid the country
of opium poppies.

Philippine troops fail to capture Muslim rebel chieftain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ Police raided a southern
Philippine village but failed to capture a Muslim rebel leader who
is one of the country's most wanted men, an official said
Wednesday.
	   Police surrounded the village in Lamitan on the island province
of Basilan over the weekend after informants reported seeing
Abdurajak Abubakar Janjalani, chieftain of the separatist Abu
Sayyaf rebel group, province governor Wahab Akbar said.
	   Janjalani apparently learned of the raid and escaped, he said.
	   Janjalani has been linked by authorities to bombings of Roman
Catholic churches in the southern Mindanao region, kidnappings and
an assault on a town in southern Zamboanga del Sur province that
left at least 53 people dead in 1995.
	   Akbar, himself a former Muslim separatist rebel, has been
encouraging Abu Sayyaf members to accept a government offer of
amnesty and start new lives. President Joseph Estrada, however, has
refused to grant amnesty to Janjalani, saying the rebel leader
should be punished for his crimes.
	   The Abu Sayyaf is the smaller of two Muslim rebel groups
fighting the Manila government for the establishment of an
independent Islamic state in the southern Philippines.
	   The military says the Abu Sayyaf's membership has dwindled from
about 900 in 1996 to about 200, mostly because of surrenders and
battle casualties.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin was released from a
hospital Wednesday after receiving treatment for more than two
weeks for pneumonia. He moved to a country residence outside the
capital, the Kremlin said.
	   Yeltsin has rarely been seen or heard since he went to the
hospital on Nov. 22. He emerged briefly Monday to fire Chief of
Staff Valentin Yumashev and three of his deputies before returning
to the hospital three hours later.
	   Yeltsin's spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, said that the president
had been moved to the Rus residence and would receive periodic
checkups at the hospital, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Yeltsin has been a part-time president for months as his health
has declined. He has played little role in Russia's pressing
economic problems.
	   ``He is not governing anything any longer,'' Communist Party
leader Gennady Zyuganov said. ``This is simply an agony.''
	   The Russian economy slumped earlier this year, partly in
response to Asia's economic travails, and plummeted after Aug. 17,
when the government devalued the ruble and temporarily froze
foreign debt payments. Yeltsin, who had heart bypass surgery in
1996, fired almost his entire cabinet as a result of that decision.
	   Yakushkin said the president fired Yumashev for failing to stem
crime and for reacting too mildly to a Communist parliament
deputy's anti-Semitic remarks. But most people assumed the aide was
axed for speaking too candidly about Yeltsin's declining health.
	   Yumashev had said Yeltsin was too weak to handle the day-to-day
responsibilities of his job.
	   ``When the presidential inner circle starts speaking about the
boss as if he were a political outsider, you have to replace either
the president or his aides,'' the business daily Kommersant said
Tuesday. ``Yeltsin has chosen the second.''

Admission of guilt plunges Australian cricket into crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Test players Shane Warne and Mark
Waugh, admitting they were ``naive and stupid'' for taking money
from an Indian bookmaker, plunged Australian cricket into crisis
Wednesday.
	   The admission by the pair was made even more controversial by an
admission by the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) that it had covered
up the affair and asked the International Cricket Council to do the
same.
	   Australian Prime Minister John Howard, a man who enjoys cricket
more than politics, led a chorus of disbelief over the ACB's
handling of the matter.
	   ``Australians love their cricket and anything that looks as
though it's knocking cricket off its pedestal is something that's
going to deeply disturb Australians,'' Howard said.
	   The revelation shook the cricket world and is almost certain to
force the International Cricket Council to address the subject of
illegal betting in the sport at its meeting next month in
Christchurch, New Zealand.
	   Waugh was fined 10,000 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 6,400) and
Warne 8,000 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 5,100) for selling
information about weather and pitch conditions to the bookmaker.
	   At a media conference Wednesday in Adelaide, site of the third
test between Australia and England that begins Friday, Warne and
Waugh each read a statement and then left the room refusing to
answer questions, leaving ACB chief executive Malcolm Speed to deal
with the matter.
	   The ACB kept the matter secret until late Tuesday and Speed
admitted the incident's leaking had damaged Australian cricket's
reputation.
	   Both Waugh and Warne denied any involvement in match fixing or
bribery and told Speed they had never bet on cricket.
	   Waugh said he took money from the Delhi-based bookmaker to
provide information the batsman considered ``mundane.''
	   ``He asked me general questions on what the Australian side
expected from
	   the pitch and weather conditions but at no stage did I discuss
team tactics or lineups,'' Waugh said.
	   Warne, whose hopes of one day being the Australian cricket
captain will be damaged by the revelations, said he deeply
regretted the contact with the bookmaker who gave him money in
return for answering routine questions about the state of the pitch
and the weather.
	   ``As the captain of Victoria and a senior Australian cricketer,
I regularly provide much more detailed information to the media
before any match I play,'' he said.
	   ``I've had no contact with the bookmaker since and am very
disappointed and sorry for my actions.''
	   In Lahore, Pakistan cricketer Salim Malik, accused by both Waugh
and Warne of taking bribes, said he was delighted to hear that the
two Australian cricketers were at the center of the controversy.
	   A judicial inquiry is being held into match-fixing charges
against former
	   captain Wasim Akram and Malik. They have denied the charges.
	   ``I am so happy that I really don't have words to express it,''
Malik told The Associated Press.
	   He promised to sue both Waugh and Warne, accusing the Australian
pair of defaming his character with charges of bribe taking.
	   ``I am definitely going to take a legal action against Shane
Warne and Mark Waugh,'' Malik said from Lahore where he is
preparing for a second Test against Zimbabwe.
	   ``They have really upset me and have spoiled my cricket for the
last two years,'' he said. ``They were taking the money from the
bookmakers . . . I am
	   innocent and they are the liars. . . I will definitely sue them
in court.''
	   Speed said he believed the pair, two of Australia's highest-paid
cricketers, spoke to the bookmaker between two and four times over
a period of about a month during the 1994 tour of Sri Lanka.
	   ``It is inevitable that Australian cricket's very high
reputation has been damaged by this incident,'' Speed said
Wednesday.
	   ``In hindsight a different approach might have been taken,''
said Speed, who was not employed by the board at the time of the
incident.
	   ``The position that had been taken by the board nearly four
years ago was that the matter not be made public.''
	   Former Australian captain and long-serving commentator Richie
Benaud said: ``One of the most appalling things is that it's been
covered up for so long.''
	   Former International Cricket Council (ICC) president Sir Clyde
Walcott said the ICC was told of the matter by the ACB four years
ago but asked to keep it confidential.
	   ``We were asked by the ACB to keep the matter confidential and
we decided to do so,'' Walcott said.
	   ``It would have done nothing for the image of the international
game of cricket to publicize these bad happenings.'' (djp)

Philippine stocks plunge on profit-taking; index down 2.6 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks were dragged
sharply lower Wednesday by continued profit-taking, particularly in
blue chip companies, traders said.
	   Preliminary figures showed the Philippine Stock Exchange index
of 30 selected stocks fell 46.51 points, or 2.6 percent, to
1,769.34 after losing 18.51 points Tuesday.
	   The absence of fresh positive news and a still-unproved claim by
former first lady Imelda Marcos that she actually owns many of the
country's largest and best-known companies overshadowed
improvements in the country's economic fundamentals, causing
investors to sell, traders said.
	   ``I think there's still some selling left to the market,'' said
Jose Ricardo Garcia, executive vice president for Diversified
Securities.
	   The broader All Shares Index fell 14.33 points to 569.62 after
sliding 6.63 points Tuesday. Losers trounced gainers 85 to eight,
with 33 issues unchanged.
	   Among the major losers were Philippine Long Distance Telephone
Co., Manila Electric Co. and San Miguel Corp., all companies being
claimed by Mrs. Marcos. The former first lady recently said that
her late husband, Ferdinand, installed ``cronies'' who controlled
many of the Philippines' leading companies, but that the
corporations were actually owned by him.
	   Marilene Katimbang, vice president of Magnum International
Securities, said investors were ignoring improvements in currency
and interest rates and using every ``flimsy excuse'' to liquidate
their positions ahead of the holidays.
	   ``Investors are out of the market. They're out shopping,''
Katimbang said. But she expects the market to recover toward the
end of the month once fund managers start to window-dress their
portfolios.
	   Chelsea Dipasupil, assistant vice president for research at RCBC
Securities, said fundamentals remain strong but that Mrs. Marcos'
claims had spawned some uncertainty.
	   In currency trading, the peso strengthened against the dollar in
heavy morning trading, supported by the yen's strong gains against
the U.S. currency overnight, traders said.
	   The fall of U.S. stock prices buoyed the yen early Wednesday.
	   The dollar averaged 38.675 pesos in morning trading, down from
Tuesday's average of 38.983 pesos.

Yeltsin released from hospital, Kremlin says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin was released from a
hospital today after receiving treatment for more than two weeks
for pneumonia. He moved to a country residence outside the capital,
the Kremlin said.
	   Yeltsin has rarely been seen or heard since he went to the
hospital on Nov. 22. He emerged briefly Monday to fire Chief of
Staff Valentin Yumashev and three of his deputies before returning
to the hospital three hours later.
	   Yeltsin's spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, said that the president
had been moved to the Rus residence and would receive periodic
checkups at the hospital, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Yeltsin has been a part-time president for months as his health
has declined. He has played little role in Russia's pressing
economic problems.
	   ``He is not governing anything any longer,'' Communist Party
leader Gennady Zyuganov said. ``This is simply an agony.''
	   The Russian economy slumped earlier this year, partly in
response to Asia's economic travails, and plummeted after Aug. 17,
when the government devalued the ruble and temporarily froze
foreign debt payments. Yeltsin, who had heart bypass surgery in
1996, fired almost his entire cabinet as a result of that decision.
	   Yakushkin said the president fired Yumashev for failing to stem
crime and for reacting too mildly to a Communist parliament
deputy's anti-Semitic remarks. But most people assumed the aide was
axed for speaking too candidly about Yeltsin's declining health.
	   Yumashev had said Yeltsin was too weak to handle the day-to-day
responsibilities of his job.
	   ``When the presidential inner circle starts speaking about the
boss as if he were a political outsider, you have to replace either
the president or his aides,'' the business daily Kommersant said
Tuesday. ``Yeltsin has chosen the second.''

Ex-insurance saleswoman arrested in poisoned curry case
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with police confirmation, quote from Prime Minister
Obuchi, other details; ADDS byline
 &UR; By JOJI SAKURAI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Police arrested a woman Wednesday in a
mass-poisoning case in which arsenic-laced curry killed four people
and sickened dozens of others at a summer festival in southwestern
Japan.
	   Former insurance saleswoman Masumi Hayashi was charged with
murder and attempted murder for allegedly sprinkling the arsenic
into a pot of curry served at a festival in Wakayama, said a police
official, who only gave his surname, Miyamoto.
	   Two children died in the July 25 poisoning, which shook the
nation and was followed by a rash of apparent copy-cat poisonings.
A total of 63 people were sickened by the curry.
	   The case has attracted frenzied media attention in a country
still scarred from the Aum Shinrikyo religious cult's 1995 subway
nerve gas assault that killed 12 in Tokyo.
	   Hours before Hayashi was arrested, Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi expressed his gratitude to investigators.
	   ``I'd like to thank the Wakayama police for their efforts in
bringing the case to where it is now,'' Obuchi was quoted as saying
by Kyodo News.
	   On Wednesday, the suspect denied any involvement in the July
poisoning, Miyamoto said.
	   Hayashi had earlier been charged with allegedly serving
arsenic-laced meals to her 53-year-old husband Kenji and another
man on several occasions in 1997 in an attempt to obtain their life
insurance money.
	   Kenji has been charged in the earlier case with insurance fraud.
	   Local media had been speculating for months that Hayashi may
have been behind the curry poisoning, but police have reportedly
found little more than circumstantial evidence linking her to the
murders.
	   Investigators have found arsenic under a sink in Hayashi's home
and in about 10 other spots on her property in Wakayama, about 450
kilometers (280 miles) southwest of Tokyo.
	   The Hayashis had been under police scrutiny for years, partly
because Kenji ran a termite extermination company that gave him
access to poisonous chemicals.
	   The couple have repeatedly denied all charges brought against
them.
	   Police suspect Masumi poisoned the curry to obtain some 542
million yen (dlrs 4.5 million) in life insurance she had taken out
on five people who had taken part in gambling sessions at her home,
Kyodo News reported.
	   Hayashi allegedly tried to kill her husband to receive some 110
million yen (dlrs 920,000) in life insurance that she had secretly
taken out on him.
	   Japan's media converged on Wakayama this week as word leaked out
that Hayashi's arrest was imminent. Japan's national broadcaster
NHK devoted the first 30 minutes of its noon news broadcast
Wednesday to the expected arrest.
	   The poisoned curry case was followed by a string of poisonings
elsewhere in Japan, including the death of a man who drank a can of
tea laced with cyanide.
	   The attacks also have come as the nation is grappling with a
growing crime rate, a jump in juvenile delinquency and general
malaise related to the economy, now in its worst recession since
World War II.

Mexican Congress scrambles to compensate for lost oil revenue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo MO105 &QL; 
 &UR; By ADOLFO GARZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Congress has less than a week to approve
Mexico's 1999 budget and, with no agreement on how to compensate
for billions of dollars in lost oil revenues, lawmakers are
scrambling to avoid an unprecedented constitutional crisis that
could paralyze the country.
	   Some legislators are hoping to extend the ordinary session,
which ends Dec. 15, to vote on the budget before the end of the
year.
	   But no one is sure what would happen if the budget isn't passed
by Dec. 31. Mexico's constitution doesn't consider the possibility
_ no such provision was needed in the 68 years that the ruling
party had a majority in Congress and rubber-stamped presidential
initiatives.
	   Now, opposition parties that won control of Congress last year
are struggling to figure out how to compensate for a
multibillion-dollar shortfall caused by shrinking oil prices. Oil
revenues represent about a third of government income.
	   When Mexican oil prices reached an all-time low last week, the
Treasury Department slashed the draft budget it had submitted to
Congress in mid-November _ already the smallest Mexico had seen in
modern history.
	   The government's original proposal forecast an average oil price
of dlrs 11 a barrel. But Mexican oil is selling for about dlrs 7.50
a barrel, and there is no sign of recovery.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo's original budget plan already
eliminated subsidies for tortillas _ Mexico's staple food _ and
included unpopular tax hikes and higher prices for government goods
and services. Among the painful measures were a 31 percent increase
in gasoline prices and a 15 percent surcharge on phone service.
	   Legislators are weighing options that would be political taboos
in less drastic circumstances, such as a bigger deficit or more
foreign financial aid.
	   ``The Treasury Department will have to seek emergency financing,
which could come from the International Monetary Fund,'' said Rep.
Carlos Heredia of the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party.
	   Rep. Arturo Nunez, lower house leader of the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party, said the shortfall could be
compensated for by increasing revenue, reducing spending or
allowing a bigger fiscal deficit _ and maybe a combination of all
three.
	   Negotiations also have become mired in other issues, including
congressional approval of a dlrs 67 billion bailout of private
banks and opposition demands for the resignation of central bank
Gov. Guillermo Ortiz and other top officials.
	   Rep. Carlos Medina Plascencia, congressional leader of the
right-center National Action Party, said his party will not approve
Zedillo's budget and bailout proposals unless Ortiz resigns.
	   Ortiz, who as treasury secretary in the mid-1990s oversaw the
bailout process, already faces impeachment proceedings initiated by
the two major opposition parties, which insist the bailout was
unconstitutional because it was implemented without prior
congressional approval.
	   ``Zedillo is responsible as well, but here we cannot impeach the
president,'' Medina Plascencia said. In response to Zedillo's
bailout proposal, National Action has proposed a constitutional
amendment to allow Congress to impeach a sitting president.

Supreme Court annuls army exemptions for rabbinical students
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An arrangement dating from Israel's
establishment that exempts ultra-Orthodox Jewish men from army
service was nullified Wednesday by Israel's Supreme Court _ posing
a further threat to the government's already shaky existence.
	   Ruling the arrangement ``illegal,'' the court gave Israel's
parliament a year to work out a new arrangement. Otherwise, the
11-judge panel _ including two Orthodox judges _ threatened to make
its own rules.
	   Parties representing the ultra-Orthodox Jews have threatened to
bring down Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government
if any change is made to the arrangement exempting students at
religious seminaries _ ``yeshivas'' _ from military service.
	   Netanyahu is already struggling to survive a no-confidence vote
scheduled in two weeks on the stalled peace process with the
Palestinians. The opposition is edging close to the 61 legislators
it needs to oust his government.
	   When Israel's first prime minister David Ben Gurion agreed to
the exemptions 50 years ago _ securing support for the state from
the then-non-Zionist ultra-Orthodox community _ the number was
about 600. Today about 30,000 yeshiva students have draft
exemptions.
	   In order to qualify for the exemption, the students _ who
receive a monthly government stipend _ are not allowed to work.
	   Israeli reporters have repeatedly turned up large numbers of
Orthodox Jews with army exemptions working instead of studying.
	   A legislator for the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, Shlomo Ben Izri,
acknowledged ``isolated abuses'' in the system, but declared: ``No
power in the world will force yeshiva students into the army.''
	   The court was ruling on a suit filed by two secular legislators.
University students have also filed a suit, demanding cancellation
of exemptions for yeshiva students.
	   Israeli university students _ who ended a six-week strike over
tuition fees this week _ have complained that they serve three
years in the army, up to a month reserves duty each year and pay
thousands of dollars in tuition.
	   By contrast, they say, yeshiva students get free educations and
do not serve in the army.
	   The ultra-Orthodox say that the exemption is necessary to
guarantee the perpetuation of a culture of religious study that was
almost wiped out during the Holocaust.
	   Ben Izri suggested that an agreed-upon limit on the number of
exemptions ``would not be a problem.''

Perry meets with Chinese to discuss North Korean nuclear issue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ William Perry, the U.S. government policy
coordinator on North Korea, sounded out Chinese officials Wednesday
on how to deal with the reclusive Stalinist state.
	   Perry's one-day stopover in Beijing comes as Washington seeks to
persuade North Korea to open for inspection a suspected underground
nuclear weapons facility. Four days of talks have taken place in
the United States with a fifth session scheduled for Thursday.
	   Highlighting U.S. concern, the Clinton administration recently
named Perry, a former defense secretary, to the newly established
post of policy coordinator for North Korea.
	   Perry arrived in Beijing Tuesday from Seoul, where he held two
days of talks with President Kim Dae-jung and other top government
officials. He was scheduled to go to Tokyo later Wednesday for more
talks about North Korea's weapons program.
	   Perry said U.S. policy toward North Korea is under review and
that he wanted to hear views from China before reaching any
judgments, according to a statement from the U.S. Embassy in
Beijing.
	   The statement said Perry met with Chinese officials and
specialists on North Korea, but an embassy spokesman and the
Chinese Foreign Ministry refused to provide further details.
	   China is one of North Korea's sole remaining allies, although
relations between the communist neighbors have been strained in
recent years.
	   North Korea has refused a U.S. demand that it unconditionally
open up for inspection the suspected nuclear-related site at
Keumjang-ri, 40 kilometers (25 miles) northeast of the North's main
nuclear complex at Yongbyon.
	   While claiming that the facility is for civilian use only, North
Korea says it would allow a one-time inspection for dlrs 300
million in compensation for ``false'' accusations by the United
States in making the inspection demand. Washington has rejected the
offer.
	   U.S. officials warn that North Korea's intransigence could lead
to a collapse of a 1994 nuclear accord, under which the North's
communist government promised to abandon its suspected nuclear
weapons program in return for aid.

Prisoner release burning issue for Palestinian society

<TEXT>
	   MEGIDDO PRISON, Israel (AP) _ Palestinian men, women and even
children huddle together for hours each day in a cramped, guarded
tent with no bathrooms, no running water, nowhere to sit but the
ground and nothing to look at but the barbed-wire surrounding them
in Israel's maximum-security prison.
	   These aren't the prisoners, they're the visiting relatives.
	   Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have passed through
Israeli jails over three decades of Israeli occupation in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. Some served three months, some 30 years,
mostly on charges of militant or political acts against the Jewish
state.
	   Those who were not arrested had at least one family member who
was, making the issue of prisoner releases in the wake of peace
deals with Israel one of the most emotional quests for the
Palestinian public and its leadership.
	   It has united members from every political and social group in
Palestinian society, and divided those on the Israeli side.
	   ``When two peoples at war make peace, they hand over each
other's soldiers and prisoners and treat each other like equals.
There will be no peace between the Palestinian people and the
Israeli people as long as one Palestinian security prisoner remains
in jail,'' said Hisham Abdel Razek, who served 21 years in Israeli
jails and is now Minister for Prisoner Affairs in Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian Authority.
	   Widespread demonstrations for the release of 2,400 so-called
security prisoners _ often violent and often orchestrated by
Palestinian Authority officials _ have been held almost daily since
the two sides signed their latest Mideast accord in Washington in
October.
	   Palestinians had hoped the deal would mean the release of their
relatives. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however,
insists that none of the 750 promised releases will include those
involved in plotting or executing attacks against Israelis.
	   The United States, which brokered the deal, has not backed up
Palestinian claims that Israel is in violation of the agreement on
the prisoner issue, though it has hinted that the spirit of the
accord has been harmed by the dispute.
	   But with the issue burning in the streets and at the negotiating
table, even veteran Israeli security chief Gidon Levy, now a
lawmaker in Netanyahu's Likud party, says the hard line on
prisoners needs to be re-examined.
	   ``The release of murderers is one of the most difficult things
that can happen. But on the other hand ... there are those who have
been in jail for more than 20 years and we need to tell them there
is a light at the end of the tunnel,'' Ezra told Israel radio.
	   Every day, hundreds of Palestinians travel through several
Israeli checkpoints from homes in the West Bank or the Gaza Strip
to prisons such as Megiddo in northern Israel to visit jailed
fathers, brothers and sons held in heavily guarded tent camps on
the prison grounds.
	   Among the 200 relatives waiting hours in the visitors holding
pen Tuesday was 4-year-old Abeer who came to see her two brothers,
jailed two years ago on suspicion of membership in the militant
Hamas organization, which opposes peace with Israel and has carried
out deadly attacks against Israelis.
	   An elderly father whose son has been incarcerated for three
months without charges complained about intimidating waiting
conditions.
	   ``We are confined like sheep, surrounded by garbage. There is no
running water, no bathrooms. If these are the conditions we face,
how do you imagine the situation is in there?'' he said, adding
that he was frightened to give his name or that of his son.
	   Alia Duweikat came to see her son Adnan, who is on the fourth
year of a seven-year sentence for membership in Hamas. Like many
Palestinians, much of her anger about the prisoner issue is
directed toward Arafat, whom many accuse of abandoning the
prisoners during peace negotiations.
	   ``They have forgotten them. The leaders have forgotten the
sacrifices made for their country and people,'' she said.
	   After five hours and two security checks, Duweikat was allowed
into the visiting hall for her monthly visit with her son. The two
may not hug or exchange large gifts; they may only touch hands
through a metal fence that runs through the hall. Prisoners are on
one side, relatives are on the other.
	   Hundreds more are denied entry into Israel to visit relatives, a
handful of whom have never been charged, tried or convicted, but
who serve six-month sentences imposed by Israeli military courts
that are easily renewed and hard to fight.
	   For Palestinians, peace with Israel begins with their own state
and the release of their prisoners, explained Abdel Razek, the
minister for prisoner affairs.
	   ``People have worth and Palestinians also have pride and
dignity,'' he said. ``You can't make peace between a master and a
slave.''

Tension spreads after fundamentalists attack development agency

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA , Bangladesh (AP) _ Police were negotiating with Muslim
conservatives Wednesday to end three days of clashes with
government and private agencies that encourage women to work or
start their own businesses.
	   About 150 people were injured Tuesday when mobs attacked the
homes of senior district officials, stormed into a television relay
station and damaged several police vehicles in the town of
Brahmmanbaria, 80 kilometers (50 miles) east of Dhaka.
	   The attacks then spread to nearby rural areas, where more than
20 houses and field offices of the private agencies were set on
fire.
	   The Muslim groups called a daylong general strike in the
district Tuesday to protest police actions during clashes earlier
in the week.
	   Police said students of a large religious school marched through
the town and erected barricades during the strike, disrupting road
and railway traffic to Brahmmanbaria. Schools and commercial
centers were closed, and street traffic was light.
	   At least 360 people have been hurt in the standoff, which began
when police banned a rally at the local soccer stadium by volunteer
agencies that promote work, education and health projects in the
villages, primarily for women.
	   The conservatives believe the agenda of the agencies is
un-Islamic. Bangladesh is overwhelmingly Muslim but has no state
religion.

About 200 inspectors seeking banned weapons in Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Nearly 200 U.N. arms inspectors searched
for banned weapons in Iraq Wednesday as Iraqi newspapers renewed
complaints that the inspections were not leading to a lifting of
U.N. sanctions.
	   Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for the U.N. Special Commission in
charge of the arms inspections, said all the U.N. arms experts in
the country were working Wednesday.
	   When asked if they would be carrying out the surprise visits
that have angered Iraq before, she said only the ``inspectors will
carry on a full range of activities in Iraq.''
	   Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler had said earlier in
New York that a series of surprise visits would begin Tuesday. In
the past these visits have included such sensitive sites as offices
of Iraq's ruling Baath Party.
	   On Tuesday, nine arms monitoring groups, two biological warfare
teams and a missile unit conducted 32 searches, some using
helicopters, the Iraqi News Agency said.
	   Cross said the 130-140 inspectors on regular teams were working
Wednesday as well as some visiting experts. She would not give the
exact number involved but said it was ``a little less than 200.''
	   Iraqi newspapers, meanwhile, carried further accounts of Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz's comments in Moscow in which he said
there is a limit to Iraq's cooperation with the United Nations in
the search for weapons of mass destruction.
	   State-run newspapers first quoted Aziz's statements on his
Russian trip Tuesday. ``This situation is no longer acceptable,''
Aziz said, referring to the U.N. sanctions that have blocked free
export of Iraq's oil.
	   The Special Commission must certify Iraq has eliminated its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons as well as long-range
missiles before the sanctions can be lifted.
	   The sanctions, imposed after the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait,
have devastated Iraq's oil-based economy, and Iraqi officials have
long insisted they have fulfilled their obligations under U.N.
resolutions and that the sanctions should be lifted.
	   The arms inspectors _ who insist Iraq could still be hiding
weapons _ have been a constant source of confrontation between Iraq
and the United Nations.
	   In the latest flare-up, Iraq blocked surprise visits by the
inspectors for three months. They were only allowed to return in
mid-November under threat of U.S. and British air strikes to force
compliance.
	   On Wednesday, the Iraqi press praised U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan's statement that a military attack against any country
must have approval of the Security Council.
	   Babil, the newspaper owned by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's
son Odai, said Annan's speech to the French Parliament on Tuesday
means that ``the United States must realize its days of domination
are numbered now.''
	   In an apparent reference to NATO, Annan said that regional
organizations have an important world role, but ``any military
intervention by the international community must be approved by the
Security Council.''
	   However, in an interview published Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said the NATO alliance ``cannot be hostage
of a veto of this or that country against an operation.''
	   ``Because in such a case,'' she told the French daily Le Monde,
``NATO would be nothing more than a branch of the United Nations.''

 &UR; Yeltsin leaves hospital, moves to country residence
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin was released from a hospital
Wednesday after more than two weeks of treatment for pneumonia. He
moved to a secluded country residence outside the capital, the
Kremlin said.
	   Yeltsin has rarely been seen or heard since he was admitted to
the Central Clinical Hospital on Nov. 22. He appeared in the
Kremlin for three hours on Monday to fire several top aides and
then returned to his hospital bed.
	   Yeltsin's spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said the president had
moved to the wooded Rus residence, about 100 kilometers (60 miles)
from Moscow, for a ``convalescence period.''
	   ``Doctors are generally satisfied with the president's
condition,'' Yakushkin told the Interfax news agency. The president
will continue to receive ``periodic checkups at the hospital,'' he
added.
	   The president was allowed to begin taking brief walks around the
hospital grounds. Yeltsin insists that he has no serious health
problems, but few believe that he will be able to return to
full-time work.
	   Yeltsin did not have any meetings planned Wednesday and there
was no word on when he might return to the Kremlin.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has been a part-time president for months as his
health has declined. He has said almost nothing about Russia's
economic crisis, which hit four months ago, partly in response to
Asia's economic travails.
	   The president's latest illness clearly demonstrated that Yeltsin
is not involved in the day-to-day running of the government, though
he remains extremely sensitive to any suggestions that he's a lame
duck, or that he won't serve out his term until the year 2000.
	   The president's only major announcement during his illness was
the dismissal of his aides, some of whom had dared to comment on
the president's health problems.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov is dealing with the country's
economic turmoil, and the Cabinet on Wednesday gathered to work a
plan for next year's budget.
	   The country remains in a deep recession, with the economy
expected to shrink about 5 percent this year and forecasts pointing
toward a similar contraction, if not worse, next year.
	   Russia in the 1990s has suffered one of the worst depressions
ever experienced by an industrial nation, and Yeltsin no longer
even pretends to offer solutions to the country's entrenched
problems.

 &UR; European drug makers Zeneca and Astra to merge &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Sweden's Astra and Britain's Zeneca,
two mid-sized drug makers noted for their pain relief products,
will merge, leading to significant cost savings but costing 6,000
jobs, company officials said Wednesday.
	   ``AstraZeneca combines the best of two innovative companies with
successful track records of organic growth,'' Percy Barnevik, the
noted businessman who is nominated to be chairman of the merged
company, said in a press release.
	   The proposed chief executive officer, Tom McKillip, added in the
same communique, ``Astra and Zeneca are a perfect fit.''
	   The merger had been rumored for months.
	   Astra is best known as the maker of Prilosec, an ulcer and
heartburn medication that's the world's best selling prescription
drug and comprises about half the company's total sales.
	   But the drug is scheduled to lose its patent protection in 2001,
which will open the door for generic firms to make a less expensive
copy and slow the company's overall sales growth. Analysts
speculated that is a leading factor influencing the merger.
	   Sweden's Wallenberg family owns 12 percent of Astra, established
in 1913. The company also makes lidocaine, a popular local
anesthesia drug first developed in the 1940s.
	   Zeneca is the second-leading maker of cancer drugs behind
Bristol-Myers Squibb of the United States. It also has a large
agrichemical business and owns Salick Health Care, a U.S. operator
of cancer treatment and dialysis centers.
	   Last year, Zeneca introduced its migraine drug Zomig, and
earlier this year received clearance for a breast cancer drug.
	   But like Astra, Zeneca also has several cancer drugs expected to
soon lose their patent protection.
	   ``This is a winning combination,'' said Sergio Traversa, an
analyst with Mehta Partners, a drug industry investment firm.
``Both are strong in limited areas.''
	   The press statement said the boards of directors of both
companies unanimously agreed to the terms whereby shares would be
merged on an equal-value basis.
	   Total sales by AstraZeneca would have been 15.9 billion dollars
in 1997, the companies said, with pre-tax profit of 3.5 billion
dollars. The combined market capitalization is 67 billion dollars.
	   The corporate headquaters will be in London, the research and
development headquarters in Sweden.
	   Annual pre-tax cost savings were projected at 1.1 billion
dollars within about three years. The 6,000 jobs cutbacks would be
at the companies' plants worldwide, and take place over three
years.
	   Last week, Germany's Hoechst and France's Rhone-Poulenc agreed
to merge their drug and agrichemical businesses as the first step
toward a total merger.
	   In France, Sanofi and Synthelabo recently announced their dlrs
10 billion merger.

Central Asians win canoe races, more bad news for Chinese swimming
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be updated with later events &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Three or four minutes of furious
paddling at a Thai resort earned three gold medals for Kazakstan
and one for Uzbekistan at the Asian Games Wednesday, while China's
swimmers received more bad news.
	   After being shut out of the golds in Tuesday night's swimming
session, the Chinese learned that world champion Chen Yan was too
sick to compete in the 400-meter freestyle Wednesday. Chen also had
missed the dismal Tuesday session because of stomach problems.
	   Illness also hit Sri Lanka sprinter Susantika Jayasinghe, who
has been counting on these games to resume her career after
questions about whether she took a banned drug. A team official
said she was running a fever and feeling weak.
	   China still managed to win three gold medals in Wednesday's
early events _ one in canoeing and two in shooting _ giving it 16
so far in the 3-day-old games. Japan added one shooting gold and
had 13. South Korea had eight and Kazakstan six.
	   Uzbekistan's gold was its first of these games for the former
Soviet republic. In the four-man kayak race over 1,000 meters,
Uzbekistan pulled ahead of Kazakstan in the second 250 meters and
won in 3 minutes, 10.44 seconds to 3:11.78 for Kazakstan.
	   Kazakstan won the one- and two-man kayak races and the two-man
canoe competition, while China took the one-man canoe race in a
reservoir at the seaside resort of Pattaya.
	   In the day's closest race, Kazakstan's Sergey Sergin took an
early lead but had to spurt over the last 250 meters to hold off
China's Jiang Yuguo by less than a second in the one-man kayaks.
	   Chinese shooters won gold in the men's air pistol team
competition and the women's individual sport rifle event, while
Japan beat China for the women's rifle team gold based on a
tie-break formula.
	   The Japanese and Chinese teams both scored 1,754 points, and the
scores for the sixth and final round also were tied, but Japan won
the gold based on a better fifth round. Thailand won the bronze
with 1,745.
	   China's Wang Xian won the individual rifle gold with 589 points,
ahead of two Japanese _ Yoko Minamoto, who had 586, and Noriko
Ojima, who had 585.
	   In the air pistol team shooting, China beat Japan 1,742 to
1,723. South Korea took the bronze with 1,721.
	   Thailand's Saran Suwansa was hurt in the competition to decide
the best all-around gymnast. He failed to complete a final twist on
a somersault off the vault and appeared to wrench his knee as he
landed awkwardly. He lay on the mat for a while before he was taken
away on a stretcher, holding his head in pain. His condition was
not immediately known.

British crew change for Swiss round-world balloon bid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHATEAU D'OEX, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss balloon pilot Bertrand
Piccard announced Wednesday that he chosen Brian Jones as his
teammate for his next attempt at circling the world in a balloon.
	   Jones, 52, replaces fellow British flight engineer Tony Brown. A
statement from Piccard's organization gave no reason for the
change, but said Jones had been training as a backup pilot for more
than a year.
	   Their new Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon is to take off from
Chateau d'Oex, a resort in the Swiss Alps, as soon as weather
conditions are favorable.
	   It will be Piccard's third attempt to become the first to pilot
a balloon around the world nonstop. Four other teams, including a
combination of Virgin boss Richard Branson and Chicago millionaire
Steve Fossett, are also planning bids for the record.
	   Branson and Fossett are to take off from Marrakech, Morocco. The
other takeoff points are Alice Springs, Australia; Chicago; and
Albuquerque, N.M.

Theraveda Buddhist university opens in Myanmar capital

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ More than a thousand monks, their saffron
robes resplendent in the morning sun, chanted ancient sutras on
Wednesday at the inauguration ceremony of Myanmar's first Theraveda
Buddhist university.
	   Also in attendance at the convocation near the Kaba Aye, or
World Peace, Pagoda in the capital of Yangon were government
leaders and foreign diplomats.
	   Myanmar, also called Burma, was an isolated country that closed
itself off to the outside world for 26 years from 1962-88 in a
failed attempt at socialism under the rule of Gen. Ne Win.
	   But in a sign of changing times, the new university will conduct
its classes in English so that foreign students will be encouraged
to enroll and enable them to understand the teachings, said the
university's rector, Sayadaw Sila Nandabhivamsa.
	   Nandabhivamsa, who had been living in the United States,
returned to Yangon to take charge of the university at the behest
of the government.
	   Of the 107 students enrolled in the school's first program, 54
are foreign monks, nuns and lay students. They come from 17
countries, ranging from neighboring Thailand to Germany, Mexico and
Canada.
	   In a message read at the ceremony, Gen. Than Shwe, chairman of
the military government, said the International Theraveda Buddhist
Missionary University will share and propagate the doctrines of
Theraveda Buddhism throughout the world.
	   Myanmar is a center of Theraveda Buddhism, widely practiced in
Southeast Asia and one of the religion's two major schools of
thought. The other, Mahayana, has spread throughout North Asia.
	   Many scholars consider Theraveda closer to the original form of
the religion, which was founded in India about 2,500 years ago by
Siddhartha Gautama, called the Buddha.
	   Myanmar boasts some of the most dazzling Buddhist pagodas and
temples on earth, thanks partly to the former isolationist policies
that slowed economic development and also to frequent restoration
efforts supported by the country's military leaders.
	   The gold-coated spire of the nation's most famous pagoda, the
Shwedagon, can be seen glimmering by air passengers approaching the
capital. A temple complex further north, in the ancient city of
Bagan, is said to rival Cambodia's Angkor Wat.
	   Students at the new university can receive a diploma in Buddhist
doctrine, or dharma, after one year of study or continue on for
bachelor and master's degrees.
	   Tuition, room and board are free for those who have passed the
entrance examination.

Japanese stocks close higher, dollar lower against yen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with late dollar, bond, other details

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices rebounded Wednesday after a
late surge in futures prices offset negative sentiment caused by
Wall Street's overnight fall. The U.S. dollar retreated against the
yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 123.70 points,
or 0.84 percent, to close the day at 14931.90. On Tuesday, the
Nikkei gained 84.71 points, or 0.58 percent.
	   The dollar bought 118.78 yen in late afternoon trading, down
1.08 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New
York level of 119.31 yen overnight.
	   Share prices finished higher for the third straight session as
investors covered short, or oversold, futures positions in the last
hour of trading, analysts said.
	   A drop in bond prices, encouraging investors to shift funds from
bonds into stocks, also contributed to the rise.
	   Shares had been trading lower for most of the session, pushed
down by an overnight fall in U.S. stocks. In New York, the Dow
Jones industrial average ended at 9,027.98, down 42.49 points.
	   In Tokyo, many investors took to the sidelines ahead of Friday's
settlement of December futures and options, when a surge in trading
could cause share prices to swing unpredictably.
	   Participants also turned cautious as they awaited the release
Monday of the Bank of Japan's closely-watched quarterly ``tankan''
business confidence survey.
	   But Parliament's swift approval of a 5.7 trillion yen (dlrs 48
billion) supplementary budget Tuesday evening cushioned the
market's fall earlier in the day, traders said.
	   The extra budget will help fund the 24 trillion yen (dlrs 200
billion) economic stimulus package that the government unveiled
last month.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 8.75 points, or 0.77 percent, to 1,140.74. The
TOPIX rose 6.99 points, or 0.62 percent, the previous day.
	   An estimated 367.50 million shares changed hands on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, compared to 356 million on
Tuesday. Advances outnumbered declines 623 to 490, while 177 issues
were unchanged.
	   On the foreign exchange market, dollar-buying sentiment was
dampened early in the morning by the weakness on Wall Street as
well as lingering worries over the outlook for the U.S. and Latin
American economies, traders said.
	   The dollar ranged between 118.60 to 119.50 during the day's
trading.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.110 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.050 percent,
driving its price down to 105.92 yen from 106.47 yen.

Gulf leaders winding up summit, defer decision on oil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ The leaders of six Gulf
Arab states apparently have decided to postpone to March a decision
on cutting back their oil production as they prepared to close
their summit Wednesday.
	   Officials said the Gulf Cooperation Council meeting would end
with a resolution giving its positions on Iran's occupation of
three Gulf islands, a unified customs tariff, and the
eight-year-old U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
	   But despite intensive discussions on the record-low price of
oil, the leaders were not convinced that further cuts in production
would shore up the market, a Gulf official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   Jamil al-Hojeilan, the secretary-general of the Gulf Cooperation
Council, said Tuesday that overproduction by oil-rich nations was
to blame for the price slump.
	   Al-Hojeilan told the Middle East Broadcasting Corp., an Arabic
TV network, that ``the whole problem'' was caused by countries not
sticking to their production quotas.
	   Analysts say Venezuela, Iran, Indonesia and Qatar are the main
over-producers.
	   ``The strategic view of oil policy in the GCC countries is to
keep a balance between supply and demand. We hope that pledges of
abiding by quotas agreed upon are respected,'' al-Hojeilan said.
	   He denied that GCC oil ministers had agreed to reduce
production.
	   Officials at the summit had earlier made such a claim to The
Associated Press, adding that the GCC ministers also agreed to ask
other producers in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to join them in the cuts, starting in March.
	   The message Wednesday was Gulf leaders and oil ministers had
decided to defer a decision on production cuts to an OPEC meeting
scheduled in March.
	   Shortly before the GCC meeting began, January futures contracts
for Brent crude _ a widely watched benchmark _ fell to a record low
of dlrs 9.92 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange in
London.
	   Gulf oil generally sells at a dollar or two less than the North
Sea's Brent _ which itself was selling for around dlrs 20 a barrel
as recently as 1997.
	   The GCC comprises Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and
the Emirates. All except Oman and Bahrain are members of OPEC.
	   The Gulf countries, which together sit on half the world's
proven oil reserves and depend on exports for 75 percent of their
revenues, have been hard hit the collapse of oil prices.
	   At the start of the three-day summit Monday, Saudi Arabia's
Crown Prince Abdullah warned that the oil boom days were over and
that Gulf states should face the new reality and tighten their
belts.
	   He suggested setting a maximum deadline of one year for setting
up a GCC customs union that has been under discussion for 15 years.
A final resolution, to be released at the summit's close Wednesday,
includes the one-year deadline, said summit officials, insisting on
anonymity.
	   The union, the first step to a common market, is a prerequisite
for free trade deals with other trading blocs such as the GCC's
main trading partner, the European Union.
	   Kuwait's Al-Rai Al-Amm daily reported Wednesday that GCC leaders
received a letter from Baghdad warning against a final communique
that took a tough stance on Iraq. But the summit officials said
they did not know of such a letter.
	   They said the final resolution would emphasize the need for U.N.
sanctions against Iraq to be lifted, but only if Iraq abides by all
Security Council resolutions and cooperates with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   The sanctions were imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   The resolution also will call for international arbitration of a
territorial dispute between Iran and the Emirates. Both claim Abu
Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs, three tiny islands that Iran
annexed in 1992, said the officials.
	   Iran has rejected arbitration in favor of direct talks.

Israeli company drilling for oil near Tel Aviv
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli oil exploration company is
redrilling at an existing well northeast of Tel Aviv in an effort
to confirm the presence of high-quality oil in the region.
	   The two-day test 30 kilometers (20 miles) northeast of the
Mediterranean coastal city began Tuesday and final results are
expected in two to three days, the managing director of Givat Olam
Oil Ltd. said Wednesday.
	   ``Today we had a huge gas flame, seven meters (yards) long,
which means there's a flow,'' Laurence Becker said. ``We're not
sure yet whether it's gas or oil or both.''
	   On Nov. 29, Givat Olam published a prospectus for a rights issue
to raise 16.8 million shekels (dlrs 4.02 million) on the Tel Aviv
Stock Exchange.
	   The money will be used to drill a new well five kilometers
(three miles) west of the existing well, in a region that Givot
Olam says bears great oil-producing potential.
	   Previous tests at the existing well in 1994 disclosed several
gallons of oil of Silurian source - the same family of oil found in
Saudi Arabia, Syria and Algeria, Becker said.
	   New research by Givot Olam indicates that the oil-potential zone
at the existing well exists in a 15-meter-thick (49-foot-thick)
section at a depth of 4,365 to 4,380 meters (14,320-14,370 feet).
	   Givot Olam thinks this same reservoir reaches 300 meters (1,000
feet) in thickness at the new site it wants to drill. The test
being conducted this week will indicate whether far larger
quantities of high quality oil exist in the new site, Becker said.
	   Estimated potential reserves at the new site are 1 billion
barrels (42 billion gallons) of oil and 4 trillion cubic feet (133
billion cubic meters) of gas, the company said in a release.
	   Givot Olam shares will be available to current shareholders
until Dec. 16 and will be sold to the general public on Dec. 17

Swiss lawmakers elect country's first female president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss politicians on Wednesday elected
Interior Minister Ruth Dreifuss as the country's president for
1999, making her the first ever woman to lead the Swiss government.
	   Dreifuss, 58, of the left-of-center Social Democrats, replaces
Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti in the largely ceremonial post, which
rotates on an annual basis between the seven members of the
coalition cabinet.
	   An assembly of the two houses of parliament approved Dreifuss'
appointment in a secret ballot by 158 votes out of a possible 210.
	   Her deputy will be Defense Minister Adolf Ogi, who thus stands
in line to be president in 2000.
	   Dreifuss in 1993 became only the second woman to be elected to
the Federal Council, or cabinet, and is its only female member. She
is believed to be the first federal councillor from a Jewish
family.
	   Lawmakers applauded her election as president. ``We're happy for
the president and for all the women of this country,'' said Trix
Heberlein, president of the Swiss parliament.
	   Dreifuss, an economist and expert on social security, is in
control of health and social issues. She has overseen Switzerland's
drug policy, introducing measures to give heroin to long-term
addicts.

Intransigent India pushing subcontinent toward war: Pakistan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ An intransigent India is pushing the
Asian subcontinent toward a military confrontation that could
escalate into a nuclear war, the prime minister of the
Pakistani-controlled section of Kashmir warned on Wednesday.
	   Chaudhry Sultan Mahmood, prime minister of Azad Kashmir, said
Pakistan is becoming fed up with stalled efforts to bring peace to
the disputed province.
	   ``It doesn't matter what we say, India says 'no'. We say
international mediation, India says 'no'. We say a vote by
Kashmiris for self-determination, India says 'no'. India is not
serious to solve the Kashmir problem,'' Mahmood said in an
interview Tuesday with The Associated Press.
	   The 51-year-old border dispute has taken on new urgency since
India and Pakistan exploded underground nuclear devices in May and
declared themselves nuclear powers.
	   Mahmood said he fears frayed nerves and relentless cross border
attacks could accidentally spark an all-out war.
	   Pakistan and Indian have fought three wars since they gained
independence from Britain in 1947. Two of those wars have been over
Kashmir, and a 10-year insurgency in Indian-controlled Kashmir has
claimed thousands of lives.
	   He said that each day Indian troops fire at Pakistani civilians
living along the disputed border that divides Kashmir between the
two South Asian neighbors.
	   Both countries accuse each other of sending infiltrators across
the border.
	   Several months ago, Mahmood distributed 2,500 guns to villagers
living on the border. The guns, he said, were to allow residents to
defend against Indian infiltrators.
	   But Mahmood warned that the relentless firing increases
tensions.
	   India blames Pakistan for fomenting violence in its side of the
border, where a 10-year insurgency has left tens of thousands of
people dead. Indian Kashmir is the only Muslim-dominated state in a
predominately Hindu India.
	   Pakistan denies giving military aid to Muslim insurgents across
the border, saying its help is only political and moral.
	   But Mahmood says that Pakistan cannot stop some militant
Muslims, who see the secessionist movement in Kashmir as holy war.
	   ``We can't say that no one is going, but they are not assisted
by the government,'' he said.
	   With the region facing a nuclear arms race, Mahmood said the
international community, and the United States in particular, has a
responsibility to prevent a nuclear war on the Asian subcontinent.
	   ``As a superpower how can the United States not intervene to
prevent a nuclear war that could put the lives of more than 1
billion people in danger?'' he asked. ``It's credibility as a
superpower is at stake.''
	   Mahmood said the international community must pressure India to
accept third-party mediation, something that the New Delhi
government has steadfastly opposed.
	   ``We live in a global village and international opinion is
important,'' he said. ``With enough pressure India can't afford to
say no to everything.''

Nike Reviews Sponsorship Of Australian Cricketer Warne
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Sports-Cricket-Australia-Bribes

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Leading test cricketer Shane Warne's
multi-million dollar contract with U.S. sports apparel giant Nike
Inc. hung in the balance Wednesday after he admitted selling
information to an Indian bookmaker in 1994.
	   Nike executives late Wednesday remained locked in discussions
with Warne and declined to comment on whether he will continue as a
Nike-endorsed sportsman.
	   A spokeswoman for Nike said a statement on Warne's future with
the company will be issued Thursday.
	   The company heavily promotes Warne, one of the sport's all-time
great bowlers, to sell its products across Asia and the cricket-mad
subcontinent.
	   Warne and teammate Mark Waugh said they received payments of
5,000 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 3,100) 6,000 Australian dollars
(U.S. dlrs 3,720) respectively from a Madras-based bookmaker during
a 1994 tour of Sri Lanka.
	   The pair were fined a total of 18,000 Australian dollars (U.S.
dlrs 11,160) by the Australian Cricket Board when the matter came
to its attention in February 1995. The event was covered up by the
sport's governing body until the news broke late Tuesday.
	   Warne and Waugh told reporters they sold information relating to
ground conditions and weather to the bookmaker during a one-day
tournament in Sri Lanka.
	   However, the two said they didn't engage in match-fixing and
were guilty of only being ``naive'' and ``stupid.''
	   The disclosure is significant because it was on a tour of
Pakistan days after their team had left Sri Lanka that Waugh and
Warne claim they were approached by Pakistani cricketer Salim Malik
and offered U.S. dlrs 200,000 each to play poorly.
	   They refused these offers.
	   Waugh and Australian captain Mark Taylor gave evidence to a
Pakistani inquiry into match-fixing and betting, which has centered
on allegations surrounding Malik, during the national team's tour
of that country earlier this year.
	   Warne and Waugh are well known across the cricketing world, and
endorse many products including clothes, sunglasses, nicotine
patches and anti-dandruff shampoo.

Indian policeman in feud with legend will run to prove his point
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A police officer feuding with an Indian
sports legend over a 38-year-old national record is preparing to
run in the Asian Games to prove he is better, and should be paid a
promised 200,000 rupees (dlrs 4,770).
	   The money would equal two years' salary for Paramjeet Singh, 26,
an officer with India's paramilitary Central Reserve.
	   For two months, Singh has been in a feud with Milkha Singh,
nicknamed the ``flying Sikh,'' over an offer Milkha made to pay any
Indian who could beat his time of 45.6 seconds for 400 meters at
the 1960 Rome Olympics, where he missed bronze by 0.01 seconds.
	   No Indian ever has won a medal in Olympic track and field.
	   Paramjeet ran 45.70 at a home meet in November, and insists that
counts as better than Milkha's time according to official
recalculations of old records timed by hand-operated stop watches.
	   Runners in the earlier era gained an advantage from the delay
while the timer was reacting to the starting gun. In a review of
Milkha's Rome run, officials had added 0.14 seconds to the
hand-timed 45.6, making it 45.74 _ slower than Paramjeet's time.
	   But Milkha does not accept the change, and he believes that an
Indian who can beat 45.6 is yet to be born.
	   ``My record of 45.6 still stands. If a timing is registered, it
is there. You cannot change it after some years,'' Milkha said in a
recently published interview.
	   And he insists he will pay the 200,000 rupees only if Paramjeet
runs faster than 45.6. He also has added another condition _ the
record must be broken at an international meet. Paramjeet broke
Milkha's recalculated time at a meet in the eastern city of
Calcutta.
	   ``He should have said earlier that the record had to be broken
abroad. Anyway, even if he does not give me any money, I don't
mind,'' Paramjeet said in a recent interview.
	   Paramjeet, a former volleyball player and a triple jumper,
arrived in Bangkok Wednesday along with 32 other Indian athletes
and officials for the Asian Games track and field competition
starting Sunday.

Obuchi support rate up slightly at 29 percent, but disapproval
</HEADLINE>
still high &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Those who approve of Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi's leadership rose 4 percentage points to 29 percent this
month from two months ago, a poll by Kyodo News service released
Wednesday showed.
	   Those who disapprove stood at 65.5 percent in the poll conducted
Saturday and Sunday by interviewing a nationwide random sample of
3,000 voters. That was down 1.7 percentage points from a similar
Kyodo poll in September.
	   As in most Japanese opinion polls, it did not give a margin of
error. The response rate was 63.7 percent.
	   Among the respondents who support Obuchi, 42.5 percent said they
saw no alternative, while 25.6 percent said they trust him, it
said.
	   Stuck with the insurmountable task of turning around the
nation's worst recession in a half-century, the Obuchi
Administration has been unpopular from its start in July.
	   Obuchi's ruling party suffered a major setback in parliamentary
elections over the summer, underlining the growing public
frustrations over the economy.
	   Since then, Tokyo has passed a package of bank reform bills to
fix the nation's massive bad debt problems leftover from the
excessive lending of the 1980s.
	   Last month, Obuchi unveiled a record stimulus package of 24
trillion yen (dlrs 200 billion) in new public spending and tax
cuts, surpassing the one released in April totaling 17 trillion yen
(dlrs 143 billion).
	   The effects of such efforts have yet to be clearly felt,
although some government officials say the worst is over.
	   Wednesday's poll found that those who support the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party rose to 32.5 percent, up 6.1 percentage points.
	   Those who support the main opposition Democratic Party dropped 6
percentage points to 16.8 percent.
	   A recent sex scandal of Democratic Party leader Naoto Kan is
believed to be behind the drop in the party's popularity, Kyodo
said. Kan has denied he had an extramarital affair, but the
suspicions have tarnished his clean, feminist image.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ For the first time in decades, Japan's work force
could shrink this year as companies restructure to adjust to the
country's economic downturn, the government said Wednesday.
	   The average monthly number of wage earners, excluding the
self-or family-employed, tumbled by 250,000 from January-October
this year, compared to the same period last year, said Ryo
Ishibashi, a spokesman for the Management and Coordination Agency.
	   ``We are not making projections, but there is a strong
possibility that the total for the year will be lower,'' Ishibashi
said.
	   Based on agency statistics, Japan's Nihon Keizai financial daily
estimated that the average number of wage earners through December
will total between 200,000 and 300,000 less than last year's 53.91
million.
	   Such a decline in the number of salaried workers would be the
first since the government started compiling employment statistics
in 1953.
	   The ranks of Japanese company workers have been steadily growing
since the end of World War II. But Japan's stubborn recession has
sent bankruptcies soaring and forced many companies to reduce their
work forces to survive.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Warning Thailand has yet to emerge from
crisis, Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai pledged to forge ahead with
wide-ranging reforms and fight the massive corruption which
undermined one of the world's fastest growing economies.
	   ``Our highest priority remains getting the economy going again
through continued financial and corporate restructuring,'' he told
the Foreign Correspondents Club of Thailand on Tuesday night.
	   Chuan said the situation remained ``fragile'' and global factors
could veer Thailand from its target of turning the economic corner
by the second half of 1999.
	   He cited the danger of weak foreign demand and thus lower
domestic prices in agriculture, a backbone of the Thai economy and
source of employment for millions.
	   ``The crisis mentality we inherited has subsided. There is no
longer talk of a weak baht (currency) and capital flight,'' he
said. ``But despite these positive developments ... much more still
remains to be done.''
	   In the coming year, Chuan said, his government would increase
fiscal spending to support the agricultural sector, render more
help to small and medium sized enterprises and complete a
comprehensive financial restructuring aimed at reviving the
battered banking sector.
	   This package includes resolving a massive corporate debt,
recapitalizing the banking sector and providing greater liquidity
to the industrially productive real sector.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Sales of passenger cars in the
Philippines fell 55 percent to 31,808 in the first 11 months of
this year from 70,902 in the same period a year earlier, an
industry association reported Wednesday.
	   In November alone, car sales dropped 53 percent from the
previous year to 2,315, the Chamber of Automobile Manufacturers of
the Philippines Inc. said.
	   The group said the peso's sharp depreciation since the onset of
the regional financial crisis in July last year continues to be the
main reason for the drop in car sales.
	   The weaker peso has sent interest rates higher, making it more
difficult for car buyers who rely on bank financing.
	   Prime lending rates are currently between 14 percent and 20
percent, down from a high of 35 percent a few months after the
regional crisis began. Prior to the crisis, prime lending rates
averaged 13 percent.
	   The peso has fallen 32 percent against the dollar since July
1997.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia Wednesday denied reports
that it might quit the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries because of group's failure to stem falling oil prices.
	   ``No, we're not going to quit OPEC,'' Mines and Energy Minister
Kuntoro Mangusubroto told reporters.
	   The official Antara news agency reported Tuesday that Indonesia
might leave OPEC in light of the cartel's inability to stabilize
the global oil market.
	   ``After taking certain things into consideration, Indonesia has
decided it may quit OPEC,'' Antara quoted Rachmat Sudibyo, a senior
official at the Mines and Energy Ministry, as saying.
	   However, Kuntoro said Sudibyo's alleged comments ``must have
been a slip of the tongue.''
	   Indonesia is enduring its worst economic crisis in more than 30
years and oil and gas production is regarded as crucial to its
chances of recovery.
	   Sudibyo reportedly accused OPEC of lacking discipline. Almost
every member state wasn't sticking to agreed production cuts,
resulting in over supply and falling prices, Antara quoted him as
saying.
	   Sudibyo added, however, that because Indonesia would face
negative consequences if it left the group, it would first continue
discussions with other OPEC members about production quota
compliance.

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ South Africa and Australia jointly
attacked Japan on Wednesday over reports that it is planning a
super tariff of up to 1,300 percent on its rice imports.
	   Australia's Trade Minister Tim Fischer was blunt in his
assessment: ``Let me express the strongest possible concern about
those reports emanating from Japan.''
	   South Africa's Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin, who is in
Australia for regular talks between the two countries, quickly
endorsed Fischer's remarks.
	   ``South Africa very much shares that view,'' he said.
	   ``Decisions like this do not make any sense in the world economy
at all,'' Erwin said.
	   Fischer said Australian authorities are urgently checking the
reports, which said the huge tariff would be a strategic measure to
protect Japanese rice farmers ahead of a new round of world
agricultural trade talks.
	   He said Australia had worked hard with other like-minded nations
to secure an 8 percent opening of the Japanese rice market.

Yeltsin leaves hospital, moves to country residence

 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with additional comments by
presidential spokesman, background on Yeltsin's health problems.
DELETES outdated material. No pickup; ADDS byline. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin was released from a hospital today
after more than two weeks of treatment for pneumonia. He moved to a
secluded country residence outside the capital, the Kremlin said.
	   Yeltsin rarely has been seen or heard since he was admitted to
the Central Clinical Hospital on Nov. 22. He appeared in the
Kremlin for three hours Monday to fire several top aides and then
returned to his hospital bed.
	   Yeltsin's spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, said the president moved
to the wooded Rus residence, 60 miles outside Moscow, for a
``convalescence period.''
	   ``Doctors are generally satisfied with the president's
condition,'' Yakushkin told the Interfax news agency. The president
will continue to receive ``periodic checkups at the hospital,'' he
added.
	   The president had been allowed to take brief walks around the
hospital grounds. Yeltsin insists that he has no serious health
problems, but few believe that he will be able to return to
full-time work.
	   Yeltsin did not have any meetings planned today and there was no
word on when he might return to the Kremlin.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has been a part-time president for months as his
health has declined. He has said almost nothing about Russia's
economic crisis, which hit four months ago partly in response to
Asia's economic travails.
	   The president's latest illness clearly demonstrated that Yeltsin
is not involved in the day-to-day running of the government, though
he remains extremely sensitive to any suggestions that he is a lame
duck, or that he won't serve out his term, which ends in 2000.
	   The president's only major announcement during his illness was
the dismissal of his aides, some of whom had dared to comment on
the president's health problems.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov is dealing with the country's
economic turmoil, and the Cabinet gathered today to work on a plan
for next year's budget.
	   The country remains in a deep recession, with the economy
expected to shrink about 5 percent this year and forecasts pointing
toward a similar contraction, if not worse, next year.
	   Russia in the 1990s has suffered one of the worst depressions
ever experienced by an industrial nation, and Yeltsin no longer
even pretends to offer solutions to the country's entrenched
problems.

Iran says US recognition of its anti-drugs campaign is belated
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision to
remove Iran from its list of drug-problem countries was long
overdue, Iran's foreign minister said in remarks published
Wednesday.
	   ``The recognition by the U.S. is late. Iran has been considered
a champion in drug fighting for many years and the U.S. has
accepted this fact now,'' Kamal Kharrazi told the Tehran Times.
	   Iran spends dlrs 400 million a year in its fight against drugs
and has played a crucial role in preventing narcotics from reaching
other countries, including places in Europe, Kharrazi said.
	   Iranian television reported Kharrazi as saying 2,350 Iranians
had died in the fight against drugs. The minister was apparently
referring to anti-narcotics agents killed in clashes with smuggler,
but he did not give a time frame for the figure.
	   Kharrazi's comments were the first by an Iranian official since
President Bill Clinton announced Monday that he was removing Iran
from the list of countries the United States considers to be lax on
drugs.
	   In a letter to Congress, Clinton said that Iran is no longer a
significant producer of opium poppy, the raw material for heroin,
and that it has ceased to be a major transit point for U.S.-bound
illicit drugs.
	   Iran has been cracking down on drug smugglers since 1988.
Hundreds of traffickers have been hanged under a law that mandates
the death penalty for anyone caught with more than a small quantity
of narcotics.
	   Large drug hauls are common in Iran, which lies on a route used
by smugglers to carry drugs from Pakistan and Afghanistan to Europe
and the oil-rich Gulf.
	   Tehran has also mounted a vigorous campaign to rid the country
of opium poppies.

Russian missile forces fire test missile
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After a failed launch in October, Russia
successfully test-fired a new missile that's expected to serve as
the heart of its long-range missile forces in coming decades.
	   The launch of the Topol-M, from the Plesetsk cosmodrome in
northwest Russia, completed ``a key stage in developing the missile
complex of the 21st century,'' the Interfax news agency said,
citing the Strategic Missile Forces.
	   According to Gen. Vladimir Yakovlev, the head of the missile
forces, the first Topol-M missiles will be installed later this
year, now that all test launches are complete. The last test launch
failed when the missile burst into flames shortly after blast-off
	   Russia is pinning the future of its missile program on the
Topol-M. Most of its current long-range missiles are either past
their service lifetime or will have to be dismantled if the country
ratifies the START-II nuclear disarmament treaty.
	   Unlike Russia's older missiles, the Topol-M is a relatively
small, mobile missile designed to be fired from trucks or other
vehicles, making it difficult for potential enemies to locate and
track.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov has said that Russia
must build 35 to 45 Topol-Ms a year starting in 2000 to update its
force.
	   Meanwhile, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, in a newspaper
interview, again urged the lower house of Russia's parliament, the
State Duma, to quickly pass START-II.
	   ``It is of principal importance, extremely important for the
country's defense,'' Primakov said in an interview with the
Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper.
	   The Duma has continually stalled on the treaty, but has
gradually moved forward in recent weeks.

Le Pen's daughter sends warning to father's rival
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The daughter of National Front leader Jean-Marie Le
Pen warned his rival in a newspaper interview published Wednesday
to back her father or leave the party.
	   ``Bruno Megret must disown the rebels and rejoin our cause or
face the consequences,'' Marine Le Pen was quoted as saying in the
daily Le Parisien.
	   A member of the extreme-right party's central committee, Marine
Le Pen suggested that should Megret start his own party if he
refuses to back down in a showdown with her father.
	   ``He and his friends can create their own party,'' she said,
referring to party members close to Megret.
	   The long-simmering tensions between Le Pen and Megret burst onto
the surface this weekend and escalated after Le Pen dismissed
several party functionaries who had spoken out against him.
Speculation mounted Tuesday the party could finally split over his
bitter struggle with Megret, his longtime top lieutenant.
	   Megret scheduled a news conference for Wednesday and Le Pen
followed by planning another for Friday, fueling predictions of a
full schism.
	   The virulently anti-immigrant National front has been widely
accused of racism and anti-Semitism.
	   Le Pen, 70, has been its absolute leader for a quarter-century.
But his increasingly public struggle with the quieter and pragmatic
_ though no less ideological _ Megret has weakened his hand.

Russian missile forces fire test missile

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After a failed launch in October, Russia
successfully test-fired a new missile that's expected to serve as
the heart of its long-range missile forces in coming decades.
	   The launch of the Topol-M, from the Plesetsk cosmodrome in
northwest Russia, completed ``a key stage in developing the missile
complex of the 21st century,'' the Interfax news agency said,
citing the Strategic Missile Forces.
	   According to Gen. Vladimir Yakovlev, the head of the missile
forces, the first Topol-M missiles will be installed later this
year, now that all test launches are complete. The last test launch
failed when the missile burst into flames shortly after blast-off
	   Russia is pinning the future of its missile program on the
Topol-M. Most of its current long-range missiles are either past
their service lifetime or will have to be dismantled if the country
ratifies the START-II nuclear disarmament treaty.
	   Unlike Russia's older missiles, the Topol-M is a relatively
small, mobile missile designed to be fired from trucks or other
vehicles, making it difficult for potential enemies to locate and
track.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov has said that Russia
must build 35 to 45 Topol-Ms a year starting in 2000 to update its
force.
	   Meanwhile, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, in a newspaper
interview, again urged the lower house of Russia's parliament, the
State Duma, to quickly pass START-II.
	   ``It is of principal importance, extremely important for the
country's defense,'' Primakov said in an interview with the
Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper.
	   The Duma has continually stalled on the treaty, but has
gradually moved forward in recent weeks.

Defense wins time to prove prosecution witness lying

 &UR; With BC-Anwar Trial
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Lawyers defending jailed
politician Anwar Ibrahim won a victory Wednesday when the judge
permitted them to put a key prosecution witness in the dock for
allegedly lying to the court.
	   The lawyers made a formal request for impeaching Azizan Abu
Bakar, who claimed last week that he was repeatedly sodomized by
Anwar. On Monday, Azizan appeared to contradict himself when he
said during cross-examination that he never had sex with the ousted
deputy prime minister.
	   If the defense can prove Azizan is lying, it could seriously
dent the prosecution's case against Anwar and its goal of punishing
him for 10 charges of corruption and illegal sex. Azizan's
accusations form the basis for bulk of the prosecution case.
	   Anwar's trial was adjourned Wednesday evening while the defense
gathers documents and witnesses to prove that Azizan was giving
false evidence in court
	   Anwar is being tried on four counts of corruption. He will face
trial at a later date for one more charge of corruption and five of
illegal sex acts.
	   Judge Augustine Paul said he was allowing the defense a chance
to prove its case ``in the interests of justice and to afford the
accused an opportunity to defend himself.''
	   ``We are very happy. If we win, it will have quite a major
bearing on this case,'' said Christopher Fernando, a senior defense
attorney.
	   Earlier, Paul told defense attorneys that if they wished to
impeach the witness, they should stop cross-examining him and try
to prove instead that he was lying.
	   ``It appears illogical to obtain all the answers and then
conduct the impeachment,'' Paul told defense counsel Gurbachan
Singh. ``That's legally untenable.''
	   Gurbachan was questioning Azizan, who testified last week that
Anwar made him a ``homosexual slave'' while he was a driver for
Anwar's wife in 1992.
	   When Azizan appeared to contradict himself on Monday by saying
he never had sex with Anwar, defense lawyers began discussing the
possibility of launching separate proceedings to prove the witness
was lying under oath.
	   Azizan's has signed two statements retracting his allegations on
separate occasions but testified in court that he was coerced to do
so both times.
	   The prosecutors said they needed time to study documents that
could be used by Anwar's lawyers to prove that Azizan's testimony
should be disregarded by the court because he had repeatedly
contradicted himself.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar on Sept. 2, accusing
him of being morally unfit for office. The sacking led to demands
for political reforms and massive anti-government protests in the
normally placid Southeast Asian capital.

Gulf leaders winding up summit, defer decision on oil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Gulf leaders postponing
decision on whether to cut back oil production; details on draft
text of final resolution. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ The leaders of six Gulf
Arab states apparently have decided to postpone to March a decision
on cutting back their oil production.
	   As the Gulf Cooperation Council prepared to close its summit
Wednesday, officials said the meeting would end with a resolution
giving its positions on Iran's occupation of three Gulf islands, a
unified customs tariff, and the eight-year-old U.N. sanctions on
Iraq.
	   But despite intensive discussions on the record-low price of
oil, the leaders were not convinced that further production cuts
would shore up the market, a Gulf official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   Jamil al-Hojeilan, the secretary-general of the Gulf Cooperation
Council, said Tuesday that overproduction by oil-rich nations was
to blame for the price slump.
	   Al-Hojeilan told the Middle East Broadcasting Corp., an Arabic
TV network, that ``the whole problem'' was caused by countries not
sticking to their production quotas.
	   Analysts say Venezuela, Iran, Indonesia and Qatar are the main
over-producers.
	   ``The strategic view of oil policy in the GCC countries is to
keep a balance between supply and demand. We hope that pledges of
abiding by quotas agreed upon are respected,'' al-Hojeilan said.
	   He denied that GCC oil ministers had agreed to reduce
production.
	   Officials at the summit had earlier made such a claim to The
Associated Press, adding that the GCC ministers also agreed to ask
other producers in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to join them in the cuts, starting in March.
	   The message Wednesday was Gulf leaders and oil ministers had
decided to defer a decision on production cuts to an OPEC meeting
scheduled in March.
	   Shortly before the GCC meeting began, January futures contracts
for Brent crude _ a widely watched benchmark _ fell to a record low
of dlrs 9.92 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange in
London.
	   Gulf oil generally sells at a dollar or two less than the North
Sea's Brent _ which itself was selling for around dlrs 20 a barrel
as recently as 1997.
	   The GCC comprises Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and
the Emirates. All except Oman and Bahrain are members of OPEC.
	   The Gulf countries, which together sit on half the world's
proven oil reserves and depend on exports for 75 percent of their
revenues, have been hard hit the collapse of oil prices.
	   At the start of the three-day summit Monday, Saudi Arabia's
Crown Prince Abdullah warned that the oil boom days were over and
that Gulf states should face the new reality and tighten their
belts.
	   He also suggested setting a one-year deadline for establishing a
GCC customs union, which has been under discussion for 15 years. A
final resolution, to be released at the summit's close Wednesday,
includes the one-year deadline, summit officials said, insisting on
anonymity.
	   The union, the first step to a common market, is a prerequisite
for free trade deals with other trading blocs such as the GCC's
main trading partner, the European Union.
	   Kuwait's Al-Rai Al-Amm daily reported Wednesday that GCC leaders
received a letter from Baghdad warning against a final communique
that took a tough stance on Iraq. But the summit officials said
they did not know of such a letter.
	   They said the final resolution would emphasize the need for U.N.
sanctions against Iraq to be lifted, but only if Iraq abides by all
Security Council resolutions and cooperates with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   The sanctions were imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   The resolution also will call for international arbitration of a
territorial dispute between Iran and the Emirates. Both claim Abu
Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs, three tiny islands that Iran
annexed in 1992, said the officials.
	   Iran has rejected arbitration in favor of direct talks.

European drug makers Zeneca and Astra to merge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR;  &UR; Eds: Leads throughout to CORRECT spelling to McKillop sted
McKillip, CLARIFY current positions of Barnevik and McKillop,
CLARIFY that proposed company to be called AstraZeneca. MINOR
EDITING. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Sweden's Astra and Britain's Zeneca,
two mid-sized drug makers noted for their pain relief products,
will merge, leading to significant cost savings but costing 6,000
jobs, company officials said Wednesday.
	   ``AstraZeneca combines the best of two innovative companies with
successful track records of organic growth,'' Percy Barnevik,
nominated to be chairman of the merged company AstraZeneca, said in
a statement released by Astra.
	   Barnevik is the head of Investor AB, the investment arm of
Sweden's Wallenberg family, which owns 12 percent of Astra.
	   The new company's proposed chief executive officer, Tom
McKillop, added in the same statement ``Astra and Zeneca are a
perfect fit.'' McKillop currently is chief executive officer of
Zeneca.
	   The merger had been rumored for months.
	   Astra is best known as the maker of Prilosec, an ulcer and
heartburn medication that's the world's best selling prescription
drug and comprises about half the company's total sales.
	   But the drug is scheduled to lose its patent protection in 2001,
which will open the door for generic firms to make a less expensive
copy and slow the company's overall sales growth. Analysts
speculated that is a leading factor influencing the merger.
	   Astra, established in 1913, also makes lidocaine, a popular
local anesthesia.
	   Zeneca is the second-leading maker of cancer drugs behind
Bristol-Myers Squibb of the United States. It also has a large
agrichemical business and owns Salick Health Care, a U.S. operator
of cancer treatment and dialysis centers.
	   Last year, Zeneca introduced its migraine drug Zomig, and
earlier this year received clearance for a breast cancer drug.
	   But like Astra, Zeneca also has several cancer drugs expected to
soon lose their patent protection.
	   ``This is a winning combination,'' said Sergio Traversa, an
analyst with Mehta Partners, a drug industry investment firm.
``Both are strong in limited areas.''
	   The statement said the boards of directors of both companies
unanimously agreed to the terms whereby shares would be merged on
an equal-value basis.
	   Total sales by AstraZeneca would have been 15.9 billion dollars
in 1997, the companies said, with pre-tax profit of 3.5 billion
dollars. The combined market capitalization is 67 billion dollars.
	   The corporate headquaters will be in London, the research and
development headquarters in Sweden.
	   Annual pre-tax cost savings were projected at 1.1 billion
dollars within about three years. The 6,000 jobs cutbacks would be
at the companies' plants worldwide, and take place over three
years.
	   Last week, Germany's Hoechst and France's Rhone-Poulenc agreed
to merge their drug and agrichemical businesses as the first step
toward a total merger.
	   In France, Sanofi and Synthelabo recently announced their dlrs
10 billion merger.

Indonesian prosecutors question Suharto as students protest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with student protests; TRIMS.

 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Facing allegations of massive
corruption over three decades in power, former President Suharto
was questioned by state prosecutors Wednesday amid a huge security
clampdown.
	   Later, police near the home of Suharto's successor, President
B.J. Habibie, clashed with hundreds of students who rejected the
government probe as cosmetic.
	   Dressed in a traditional batik shirt, 77-year-old Suharto smiled
after emerging with eight defense lawyers from four hours of
questioning.
	   Six investigators from the office of Indonesia's attorney
general asked him 43 questions about the source of his wealth. But
it remains unclear if Suharto will ever face prosecution.
	   ``No one is above the law,'' Suharto said softly before a throng
of reporters at the Jakarta High Attorney's Office. ``But every
citizen has the right to be protected by the law.''
	   ``I have answered all the questions and I am prepared to give
further explanation if the attorney general's office wishes,'' said
Suharto, who lives as a virtual recluse in his Jakarta home.
	   Convinced that the government is too beholden to Suharto to
conduct a thorough probe, students who want the former
authoritarian leader to be put on trial staged several protests
around Jakarta.
	   Anti-riot officers with sticks and shields pushed students away
from the headquarters of a charitable foundation that was formerly
controlled by Suharto and allegedly used to siphon off state money.
	   Police detained 31 students for allegedly not having a permit to
stage the demonstration, which was about 500 meters (yards) from
Habibie's private residence. Two students were injured.
	   More than 1,000 students also rallied outside Jakarta's police
headquarters to demand the release of two activists who were
arrested and accused of abducting a plainclothes officer at a Nov.
27 rally. The officer was released after several hours.
	   Troops and armored personnel carriers blocked off main roads,
causing traffic chaos. Security was especially tight around
Suharto's house, a frequent target in recent weeks of pro-democracy
protesters who helped oust the president in May after 32 years in
power.
	   Riots over price increases caused by Indonesia's worst economic
crisis in decades had also eroded Suharto's once-impregnable
authority.
	   Critics have complained that Habibie has stalled efforts to
investigate his predecessor and one-time mentor because he and many
government officials are also suspected of graft during the Suharto
era.
	   Student protester Alex Joyo dismissed the Suharto summons as a
mere formality. A real investigation, he said, would ``drag down a
lot of Suharto cronies, including within Habibie's government.''
	   Suharto's legal adviser, Yohanes Yacob, said last week that
senior government officials could be dragged into ``messy
litigation'' if the former president is brought to court.
	   The interview focused on multi-million dollar charitable
foundations formerly under his control, a national car project run
by one of his sons with massive tax breaks, the contents of his
banks accounts and presidential decrees that allegedly benefited
his family and friends.
	   A spokesman for Attorney General Andi Mohammad Ghalib, who is a
three-star army general, said Suharto might be summoned again.
	   Suharto has been accused of draining the state of resources to
benefit the business empires of his children and associates,
thereby aggravating the country's economic malaise.
	   Forbes magazine this year estimated Suharto's wealth at dlrs 4
billion. Others say it is much higher.
	   Previously Suharto has denied any wrongdoing and has repeatedly
scoffed at accusations that he has stashed billions of dollars in
overseas bank accounts.
	   It was the third time since his resignation that Suharto has
been questioned by state lawyers, who earlier said they had found
no evidence of wrongdoing. Students said the process was a
whitewash, and Habibie revived the investigation after a wave of
protests.
	   State prosecutors investigating alleged corruption also
questioned Mohamad ``Bob'' Hasan, a former trade and industry
minister, for eight hours at the office of Ghalib, the attorney
general.
	   Hasan, a one-time golfing buddy of Suharto, is a business tycoon
with big interests in the timber industry.

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Sweden's Astra and Britain's Zeneca
announced Wednesday that they will merge, bringing together two
mid-sized drug makers best known for their pain relief products.
	   Company officials said the deal, which had been rumored for
months, would lead to significant cost savings but also eliminate
6,000 jobs. The new company, called AstraZeneca, has annual sales
of nearly dlrs 16 billion and a total stock value of dlrs 67
billion.
	   ``AstraZeneca combines the best of two innovative companies with
successful track records of organic growth,'' Percy Barnevik,
nominated to be chairman, said in a statement released by Astra.
	   Barnevik is the head of Investor AB, the investment arm of
Sweden's Wallenberg family, which owns 12 percent of Astra.
	   Zeneca CEO Tom McKillop, who is to hold the same title for the
new company, said in the same statement that ``Astra and Zeneca are
a perfect fit.''
	   Astra is best known as the maker of Prilosec, an ulcer and
heartburn medication that is the world's best selling prescription
drug and comprises about half the company's total sales.
	   But the drug is scheduled to lose its patent protection in 2001,
which will open the door for generic firms to make a less expensive
copy and slow the company's overall sales growth. Analysts
speculated that is a leading factor influencing the merger.
	   Astra, established in 1913, also makes lidocaine, a popular
local anesthesia drug first developed in the 1940s.
	   Zeneca is the second-leading maker of cancer drugs behind
Bristol-Myers Squibb of the United States. It also has a large
agrichemical business and owns Salick Health Care, a U.S. operator
of cancer treatment and dialysis centers.
	   Last year, Zeneca introduced its migraine drug Zomig, and
earlier this year received clearance for a breast cancer drug.
	   But like Astra, Zeneca has several cancer drugs expected to soon
lose their patent protection.
	   ``This is a winning combination,'' said Sergio Traversa, an
analyst with Mehta Partners, a drug industry investment firm.
``Both are strong in limited areas.''
	   The press statement said the directors of both companies had
unanimously agreed to merge the companies' shares on an equal-value
basis.
	   Total sales by AstraZeneca would have been 15.9 billion dollars
in 1997, the companies said, with pre-tax profit of dlrs 3.5
billion.
	   The corporate headquarters will be in London, the research and
development headquarters in Sweden.
	   Annual pre-tax cost savings were projected at 1.1 billion
dollars within about three years. The 6,000 jobs cutbacks would be
at the companies' plants worldwide, and take place over three
years.
	   Last week, Germany's Hoechst and France's Rhone-Poulenc agreed
to merge their drug and agrichemical businesses as the first step
toward a total merger.

Russian fighter jet disappears in Far East
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian fighter jet disappeared in Russia's Far
East early Wednesday, and has most likely crashed, a news report
said.
	   The Su-27 fighter jet vanished off radar screens while on a
training flight near the city of Komsomolsk-on-Amur, about 6200
kilometers (3,900 miles) east of Moscow, the Interfax news agency
said, citing Russia's Defense Ministry.
	   Search helicopters were dispatched to look for the plane, which
was on a routine flight with a seasoned pilot in the cockpit,
Interfax said.
	   Russia's military aircraft have crashed frequently in recent
years due to a shortage of funds that has reduced the level of
maintenance and training.

Indonesia denies report that it might leave OPEC
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia Wednesday denied reports
that it might quit the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries because of group's failure to stem falling oil prices.
	   ``No, we're not going to quit OPEC,'' Mines and Energy Minister
Kuntoro Mangusubroto told reporters.
	   The official Antara news agency reported Tuesday that Indonesia
might leave OPEC in light of the cartel's inability to stabilize
the global oil market.
	   ``After taking certain things into consideration, Indonesia has
decided it may quit OPEC,'' Antara quoted Rachmat Sudibyo, a senior
official at the Mines and Energy Ministry, as saying.
	   However, Kuntoro said Sudibyo's alleged comments ``must have
been a slip of the tongue.''
	   Indonesia is enduring its worst economic crisis in more than 30
years, and oil and gas production is regarded as crucial to its
chances of recovery.
	   Sudibyo reportedly accused OPEC of lacking discipline. Almost
every member state wasn't sticking to agreed production cuts,
resulting in over supply and falling prices, Antara quoted him as
saying.
	   Sudibyo added, however, that because Indonesia would face
negative consequences if it left the group, it would first continue
discussions with other OPEC members about production quota
compliance.
	   An agreement among OPEC and non-OPEC oil nations in June called
for the withdrawal of more than 3.1 million barrels a day from
international markets in an attempt to boost prices.
	   However, despite the agreement, oil prices have continued to
languish at low levels not seen for more than a decade.
	   Recent industry surveys show that OPEC compliance with its
output pact is declining.
	   Indonesia, OPEC's only Asian member, can currently export 1.28
million barrels a day under OPEC guidelines. Kuntoro has previously
said that Indonesia was sticking to its production allocation and
said he would like to see the June production cuts extended through
1999.
	   The oil cartel is set to meet again in March. Kuntoro said last
week that he expected the next meeting to come up with a new
agreement to help boost prices.

Nothing close yet on Clemens deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Toronto didn't get much closer to trading Roger
Clemens, while Mark Clark, Mark Portugal and Sean Berry found new
teams.
	   ``We've gone through this first wave and gotten ourselves into
the serious contenders,'' Blue Jays general manager Gord Ash said
Tuesday after another round of Clemens talks. ``Now, it's
follow-ups.''
	   The New York Yankees, Houston Astros and Texas Rangers are the
top contenders to get the five-time Cy Young Award winner, who last
week demanded a trade. Cleveland also is in the mix, with the two
other teams believed to be in the National League.
	   New York Mets general manager Steve Phillips said Tuesday he
made an offer, but didn't know if Toronto considered him among the
final six. Atlanta is thought to have dropped out.
	   ``I haven't gotten the offers finalized,'' said Ash, who hopes
to complete a trade before this weekend.
	   Texas general manager Doug Melvin went to Toronto and met with
Ash for about 90 minutes.
	   ``I just felt it was better to sit down face to face. At least
you know one way or another whether your going to have a chance or
not,'' Melvin said. ``You can do things better face to face than
over the phone.''
	   Ash said a deal such as this takes time because of Clemens'
contract. He has salaries of dlrs 5 million next year and dlrs 6.35
million in 2000, and Toronto owes dlrs 5 million in deferred money
from the first two seasons of the deal, which currently guarantees
a minimum of dlrs 31.5 million over four years.
	   Toronto wants potential suitors to pick up as much of the
contract as possible.
	   ``Obviously on a deal of this nature, there are a lot of issues
surrounding it that have to be dealt with,'' Ash said. ``This is a
contract that is very complicated in terms of its structure and
we're making sure the clubs understand what they're taking on.''
	   Once Toronto has a package of players it like, Clemens would
have to negotiate a new contract with that team. He has the power
to block just about any deal.
	   ``I haven't gotten to that step in the process yet,'' Ash said.
``I want to first get to the point where we're talking about the
best players we can. Then we'll face the next step.''
	   Clark, a right-hander who was 9-14 with the Chicago Cubs last
season, agreed to a dlrs 9.3 million, two-year contract with the
Texas Rangers. Portugal agreed to a dlrs 3 million, one-year deal
with Baltimore and Berry agreed to a two-year contract with
Milwaukee.
	   Clark gets dlrs 4 million in 1999 and dlrs 5 million in 2000.
Texas has a dlrs 5 million option for 2001 with a dlrs 300,000
buyout. Clark had a 4.84 ERA in 33 starts, striking out 161 is 213
innings.
	   Although he was courted by the Cubs, Cleveland, Milwaukee and
Boston, Clark said he decided on the Rangers because of a lineup
that features AL MVP Juan Gonzalez, Ivan Rodriguez, Rafael Palmeiro
and Rusty Greer.
	   Portugal, a 36-year-old right-hander, was 10-5 with Philadelphia
last season. The contract, due to be formally announced by Boston
on Wednesday, calls for a dlrs 2.7 million salary in 1999 and a
club option at dlrs 3.3 million in 2000 with a dlrs 300,000 buyout.
	   Portugal, who had a 4.44 ERA in 26 starts last season, joins a
rotation that includes Pedro Martinez, Tim Wakefield and Bret
Saberhagen. The Red Sox still haven't figured about how to replace
the offense of the departed Mo Vaughn, but are said to be talking
with Gregg Jefferies.
	   Berry hit .314 for Houston this year with 13 homers and 52 RBIs.
	   ``Sean will help us to fill our need for a right-handed bat in
our lineup,'' Brewers general manager Sal Bando said. ``He also has
the experience of being with a winner and being a part of
postseason play, which is where we strive to be.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The U.S. envoy for Kosovo was
reported heading back to the region Wednesday to try to breathe new
life into the peace process, which has stalled in the strife-torn
province.
	   Christopher Hill, who is also the U.S. ambassador to neighboring
Macedonia, was due to meet members of the ethnic Albanian
negotiating team and the political representative for the
province's independence-minded guerrillas.
	   The United States and its allies are urging both sides in the
Kosovo conflict to compromise after Serbs and ethnic Albanians
rejected Washington's latest formula for bringing peace to the
troubled province.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also criticized the
two sides, warning the Serbs to stop threats of new offensives and
telling the ethnic Albanians to abandon their ``rhetoric of
independence.''
	   Last week, Hill offered a revised formula for greater self-rule
for Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's Serb republic, with a
majority ethnic Albanian population.

	   LEEUWARDEN, Netherlands (AP) _ To the Royal Dutch Air Force,
bridge is no war game.
	   A military court in this northern Dutch city has arrested a
sergeant-major who abused an Air Force photocopy machine for years
so he could keep in touch with his bridge club.
	   The military says the officer, whose name was not released, made
an estimated 30,000 photocopies over the past five years using a
machine at the air base where he's stationed, the daily De
Telegraaf reported Wednesday.
	   The 53-year-old officer has promised to reimburse the military
for the copying costs, estimated at around 3,000 guilders (dlrs
1,600).

To mark past repression, Taiwan plans human rights monument
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ In a poignant reminder of decades of human
rights suppression, Taiwan will erect a monument on a desolate
island that once served as a jail for political prisoners,
activists said Wednesday.
	   About 20 former political prisoners will attend a
ground-breaking ceremony Thursday on Green Island to ``bid farewell
to their nightmares and welcome in a new human rights era,'' said
Bo Yang, a prestigious writer who led a drive to build the
monument.
	   Before Taiwan ended martial law rule in the late 1980s, Green
Island had jailed thousands of dissidents and other intellectuals,
many falsely accused of spying for communist mainland China.
	   As a newspaper columnist, Bo had blasted the ruling Nationalist
Party for corruption and power abuse. In 1968, he was jailed for
nine years on charges of being a communist spy.
	   The names of those imprisoned will be inscribed on a monument to
feature a line written by Bo: ``That was an era when many mothers
cried in the dark nights for their children imprisoned on the Green
Island.''
	   Premier Vincent Siew will preside over the ceremony on the
island located southeast of Taiwan, officials said.
	   Although the Nationalists have continued to rule Taiwan
following democratic reforms, government leaders have expressed
regret for the past political suppression.
	   A law was passed last year to compensate dissidents jailed on
false charges of sedition. President Lee Teng-hui has expressed his
personal support by donating 100,000 Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs
3,000) to building the monument.
	   Bo, 78, was among about 2 million people who fled to Taiwan with
the Nationalist government that lost a civil war to Communist
forces in 1949.
	   ``For 5,000 years, Chinese have lived with little dignity,'' Bo
said in an interview with the United Daily News. ``The history has
been a history of false imprisonment.
	   ``Now, we have the best time in the Chinese history,'' he said.
``Everyone can say what he wants to say without fearing that he
would be taken away by a jeep waiting at his door.''

China's gymnasts takes all-around gold at Asian Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A veteran and a newcomer scored a 1-2
for China on Wednesday in the men's gymnastics all-around
competition, as controversy erupted over North Korea's women's
team.
	   While Huang Xu collected his gold, organizers headed off for a
meeting with North Korean officials to check whether any of their
women gymnasts were underage.
	   Officials said they were going to check the passports of the
North Korean team to see whether they had all reached the minimum
age of 16. Coaches from rival teams, as well as doctors and
officials, had raised questions about the girls' ages after seeing
the dimutive gymnasts perform in competition Tuesday.
	   ``We are going to investigate,'' said Wei Jizhong, chairman of
the Olympic Committee of Asia's standing committee. ``If you want
to check, you have to check their passports, there's no other
way.''
	   Another official, Amnart Ano, said there had been complaints
about the North Korean women, some of whom looked overly young.
	   Huang's all-around gold maintained China's unblemished record in
the gymnastics competition, after both the men and women had
retained the team titles they have held without a break since 1974.
China was looking for more gold later Wednesday in the women's
all-around.
	   ``I'm very pleased,'' said Huang. ``All of us could have taken
gold, it just depended who did best on the day.''
	   Yang Wei, an 18-year-old newcomer to the Chinese team, collected
silver in his first major competition. The bronze went to Naoya
Tsukahara of Japan, the son of five-time Olympic gold medalist
Mitsuo Tsukahara.
	   Huang, 19, is a veteran of China's 1997 World Championship team.
He was all muscular control on the rings, barely wobbling as he
completed an impressive routine that scored 9.7, and consistently
good throughout the five other disciplines.
	   Huang had gone into his final event, the pommel horse, trailing
his teammate Yang by just 0.025, and clinched the gold with a
nearly flawless display.
	   Huang finished with 57.825, Yang 57.600 and Tsukahara with
57.375.
	   Thailand's Saran Suwansa was taken off on a stretcher, clutching
his head in pain, after he landed heavily on a failed vault. He
failed to complete a final twist on a somersault off the vault and
appeared to wrench his knee as he landed awkwardly. His condition
was not immediately known.

Report: more than 2 million minorities live in extreme poverty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ More than 2 million members of Vietnam's
ethnic minorities live in extreme poverty, Wednesday's Labor
newspaper quoted a government report as saying.
	   Some ethnic minorities _ the Ruc in the central province of
Quang Binh, the La Hu and Sila in the northern province of Lai Chau
and the Braun and Phu La in the central highland province of Kon
Tum _ are largely hunter-gatherers, the report said.
	   Many others still practice slash-and-burn cultivation, according
to the report, released by the Department for Ethnic Minority and
Mountainous Affairs.
	   In recent years, the government has increased investment for the
impoverished ethnic minority and mountainous regions, but the
results have been modest.
	   The paper quoted a recent survey by the Ministry of Agriculture
and Rural Development as saying the per capita food in the
mountainous regions where most of the ethnic minorities live is far
lower than the national average.
	   The Khmer, Tay and Nung ethnic minority have 140 kilograms (309
pounds) of rice per head per year, the highest among the 53 ethnic
minority groups but only half of the national average.
	   Some ethnic minority groups in northern Lao Cai province go
hungry six to eight months a year, it said.
	   The paper suggested Vietnam can save its forests from
slash-and-burn cultivation if the government can provide 14 million
ethnic minority people with 2.1 million-2.3 million tons of food
per year, allowing them to switch to forestry-related jobs.
	   Vietnam exports an average of 3.5 million tons of rice per year.
	   The government has said more than 17 percent of the population
of 77 million lives under poverty line, which it sets at 55,000
dong (dlrs 4) per month for rural residents and 90,000 dong (dlrs
6.5) per month for urban residents.
	   The United Nations Development Program estimates that about half
of the population lives under the poverty line.

Korean workers protest corporate restructuring

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Thousands of auto and electronics
workers staged rallies Wednesday to protest an industry
restructuring they fear will lead to mass layoffs.
	   Pumping their clenched fists into the freezing winter air, 800
Samsung Motors workers picketed the car maker's headquarters in
Seoul and vowed to fight for their jobs.
	   ``Some sinister politicians and conglomerates are conspiring to
strangle our workers,'' said a statement read by protest leader Kim
Jin-sok. ``We will never allow that to happen.''
	   Protesters erupted into wild boos and chanted ``President Kim
Dae-jung step down!'' ``Guarantee job security!''
	   The workers were protesting an agreement reached this week
between President Kim Dae-jung and the top five conglomerates,
which called for the Hyundai, Samsung, Daewoo, LG and SK groups to
spin off half of their 264 subsidiaries.
	   Samsung Motors is to be swapped by its parent conglomerate for
the home appliance company of the Daewoo group, which also owns the
nation's second-largest auto making company.
	   Some 5,000 unionized workers at Daewoo Electronics Co., the
country's No. 2 home appliance maker, held two-hour rallies in the
company's five plants across the country, union leaders said.
	   Earlier Wednesday, 3,000 workers at Samsung Motors's passenger
car plant in Pusan, 330 kilometers (205 miles) southeast of Seoul,
put down their tools, and some of them moved to the capital to
protest at the company's headquarters.
	   Over 1,300 workers at Samsung's truck-making plant in Taegu,
central South Korea, also rallied but returned to work later.
Company spokesman Choi Jong-tak described the situation as
``volatile.''
	   President Kim said the reforms will help the bloated
conglomerates to slim down, cut debts and restore foreign
confidence in the battered Korean economy.
	   But labor unions said the deals would drive tens of thousands of
workers on to the streets while allowing the conglomerates to keep
their wealth despite their mismanagement.
	   The Samsung Motors-Daewoo Electronics swap was the centerpiece
of restructuring plans aimed at forcing the conglomerates to shed
redundant subsidiaries and focus on a handful of core businesses.
	   Conglomerates are discussing more merger deals for their
semiconductor, aerospace, train manufacturing, power plant and oil
refinery subsidiaries.
	   The top five conglomerates employ some 500,000 workers. About
170,000 of them work in the subsidiaries to be spun off or merged.
	   For decades, the conglomerates, called ``chaebol,'' thrived on
cozy relations with past military governments. A single chaebol now
controls 40 to 60 subsidiaries, making everything from computer
chips to cars, ships and garments.
	   Bankruptcies and restructuring have driven South Korea's
unemployment to a 32-year high of 7.6 percent, with 1.65 million
people out of work.

Kidnappers beheaded hostages because they feared capture, official

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechen kidnappers beheaded four foreign
hostages because they feared capture and wanted to prevent their
victims from serving as witnesses, an official in the breakaway
territory said Wednesday.
	   One alleged kidnapper was arrested Sunday, and his detention
triggered panic among the hostage-takers, Chechnya's Prosecutor
General Mansur Tagirov told the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The kidnappers then killed the four hostages, three Britons and
a New Zealander, and their severed heads were found along a highway
in Chechnya on Tuesday.
	   Hundreds of Chechen law enforcement officers were searching for
the bodies on Wednesday, officials said.
	   Tagirov said authorities believe they know the names of those
involved in the kidnappings, but he did not release additional
details.
	   The victims _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf
Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were identified by their
former bodyguard. They were abducted Oct. 3 by unidentified gunmen
in Grozny, Chechnya's capital.
	   The men were working to restore phone services in Chechnya,
which was devastated during the 1994-6 war with Russia.
	   Chechnya now runs its own affairs, but its plagued by
kidnappings for ransom. Most hostages have been released, though
dozens remain in captivity.
	   Ray Verth, chief executive of Granger Telecom, the British
company the hostages had worked for, said the deaths were
apparently the result of a rescue attempt by Chechen authorities
Monday that went ``tragically wrong.''
	   An Associated Press reporter saw the decapitated heads Tuesday
near the village of Assinovskaya, about 40 kilometers (25 miles)
west of Grozny, the Chechen capital. He did not see any sign of the
bodies.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin expressed outrage at the
killings and urged law enforcement officials to crack down on
kidnapping, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin told reporters.
	   However, the Russian government has no authority in Chechnya,
and ethnic Russian citizens are among those who have been
kidnapped.
	   This year, 176 people have been kidnapped in Chechnya and
surrounding regions in southern Russia, and 90 of them have been
released, officials have said.

Thai prime minister campaigns for reform in televised forum
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ With the opposition threatening
impeachment, and anti-IMF sentiment rising among the public, Thai
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai held a nationally-televised forum
Wednesday to campaign for 11 controversial laws he said are
essential to repair the economy.
	   ``All the bills have passed their first readings in the House of
Representatives,'' and it is now up to parliament to work out any
changes, Chuan told the public. His economic ministers appeared
with him.
	   The International Monetary Fund is lending Thailand dlrs 17.2
billion to help bail the country out of its worst economic morass
in modern times. In exchange, however, the agency has asked
Thailand to reform its laws, financial system and economic
policy-making machinery.
	   Although the government and the IMF say the economy, which
collapsed in July 1997, is now showing signs of turning around, the
reforms have sometimes inflicted pain on parts of the Thai public.
	   A report released Wednesday by the United Nations predicted
there will be 3 million unemployed in Thailand in 1999, many more
earning below minimum wage and as many as 5 million children may
quit school because they can't afford it.
	   The result has been a rise in anti-IMF and anti-foreign feelings
among some members of the public.
	   Opponents of the 11 reform bills include an unlikely amalgam of
senators, pro-democracy groups, wealthy businessmen, right-wing
politicians and state enterprise workers.
	   Former Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh and his New
Aspiration Party is attempting to impeach Chuan for negotiating
with the IMF without parliamentary approval.
	   The bills' opponents have accused the government of trying to
force Thais out of business by relaxing restrictions on foreigners
so they can take control of Thai assets and the local economy.
	   Wednesday's televised forum is part of the administration's
public relations campaign to convince Thais that their fears are
unfounded and that reforming outdated economic laws and systems
will work to their own benefit.
	   Part of the message, however, was that tough times are still
ahead.
	   ``These bills are important for the recovery of the Thai
economy, but it doesn't mean that when these bills become law, all
the economic problems will disappear,'' Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanhaeminda told the forum.
	   The bills will, however, provide a vital basis to solve the
country's economic problems, he said.
	   Some bills are aimed at tightening bankruptcy and foreclosure
laws so that banks can recover assets from debtors who can't or
won't pay. Bad loans make up an estimated 45 percent of all bank
loans.
	   Three other bills proposed by the Interior Ministry would make
it easier for foreigners to own land and make foreign participation
in Thai businesses easier.

	   CHATEAU D'OEX, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss balloon pilot Bertrand
Piccard announced Wednesday that he has chosen Brian Jones as his
teammate for his next attempt at circling the world in a balloon.
	   Jones, 52, replaces fellow British flight engineer Tony Brown. A
statement from Piccard's organization said Jones had been training
as a backup pilot for more than a year.
	   Brown stood down by mutual agreement after differences between
the pilots emerged, ``particularly in the area of crew resource
management,'' it added.
	   The new Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon is to take off from Chateau
d'Oex, a resort in the Swiss Alps, as soon as weather conditions
are favorable. The team says it is technically ready to fly.
	   It will be Piccard's third attempt to become the first to pilot
a balloon around the world nonstop. Four other teams, including a
combination of Virgin boss Richard Branson and Chicago millionaire
Steve Fossett, are also planning bids for the record.
	   Branson and Fossett are to take off from Marrakech, Morocco. The
other takeoff points are Alice Springs, Australia; Chicago; and
Albuquerque, N.M.
	   Jones has been responsible for the building of the gondola and
flight systems for Piccard's new balloon.
	   An offer by Brown to give technical expertise and advice during
the balloon's flight has been accepted, the Breitling team said.

About 200 inspectors seeking banned weapons in Iraq
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Nearly 200 U.N. arms inspectors searched
for banned weapons in Iraq Wednesday as Iraqi newspapers renewed
complaints that the inspections were not leading to a lifting of
U.N. sanctions.
	   Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for the U.N. Special Commission in
charge of the arms inspections, said all the U.N. arms experts in
the country were working Wednesday.
	   When asked if they would be carrying out surprise visits, which
have angered Iraq before, she said only the ``inspectors will carry
on a full range of activities in Iraq.''
	   Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler had said earlier in
New York that a series of surprise visits would begin Tuesday. Past
visits have included such sensitive sites as offices of Iraq's
ruling Baath Party.
	   On Tuesday, nine arms monitoring groups, two biological warfare
teams and a missile unit conducted 32 searches, some using
helicopters, the Iraqi News Agency said.
	   Cross said the 130 to 140 inspectors on regular teams were
working Wednesday as well as some visiting experts. She would not
give the exact number involved but said it was ``a little less than
200.''
	   Iraqi newspapers, meanwhile, carried further accounts of Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz's comments in Moscow in which he said
there is a limit to Iraq's cooperation with the United Nations in
the search for weapons of mass destruction.
	   State-run newspapers first quoted Aziz's statements on his
Russian trip Tuesday. ``This situation is no longer acceptable,''
Aziz said, referring to the U.N. sanctions that have blocked free
export of Iraq's oil.
	   The Special Commission must certify Iraq has eliminated its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons as well as long-range
missiles before the sanctions can be lifted.
	   The sanctions, imposed after the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait,
have devastated Iraq's oil-based economy, and Iraqi officials have
long insisted they have fulfilled their obligations under U.N.
resolutions and that the sanctions should be lifted.
	   The arms inspectors _ who insist Iraq could still be hiding
weapons _ have been a constant source of confrontation between Iraq
and the United Nations.
	   In the latest flare-up, Iraq blocked surprise visits by the
inspectors for three months. They were only allowed to return in
mid-November under threat of U.S. and British air strikes to force
compliance.
	   On Wednesday, the Iraqi press praised U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan's statement in France Tuesday that a military attack
against any country must have approval of the Security Council.
	   Annan, apparently referring to NATO, said that regional
organizations have an important world role, but ``any military
intervention by the international community must be approved by the
Security Council.''
	   However, in an interview published Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said the NATO alliance ``cannot be hostage
of a veto of this or that country against an operation.''
Otherwise, she told the French daily Le Monde, ``NATO would be
nothing more than a branch of the United Nations.''

Chinese prosecutors investigating prominent dissident
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with prosecutors investigating
dissident; no pickup
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police have handed to prosecutors their
investigation of one of China's most prominent dissidents, bringing
him a step closer to trial, his wife said Wednesday.
	   Word that prosecutors have taken over Xu Wenli's case only 10
days after his arrest shows China's Communist Party leaders are
determined to speedily crush the political opposition party he
helped organize.
	   Another principal organizer of the China Democracy Party, Wang
Youcai, is due to be put on trial next week for subversion.
Altogether at least a dozen members of the would-be opposition
group have been detained, with a few released, in the past 10 days.
	   Officers with the Beijing police department section that handles
political offenders on Wednesday told Xu's wife, He Xintong, that
his case has been formally transferred to prosecutors, Ms. He said.
	   ``What crime he has committed, under what law, whether he has
been jailed and where he is being held, they wouldn't say,'' she
said in a telephone interview.
	   The two officers even refused to accept some clothing and other
personal articles she brought for her husband, she said.
	   All Ms. He can do now is wait, but she believes it won't be
long. Government officials have already accused Xu of endangering
national security, a catchall crime increasingly used to punish
political dissenters over the past few years. The subversion
charges against Wang Youcai fall under the statute.
	   Wang, once a student leader of the 1989 democracy demonstrations
in Tiananmen Square, was in the vanguard of efforts to set up the
China Democracy Party. He publicly announced its formation in June,
beginning anew a series of run-ins with police.
	   Xu is an influential figure in the dissident community, having
been a participant in the seminal Democracy Wall movement 20 years
ago. Jailed for 12 years, Xu resumed his democracy campaigning last
year, acting largely as an adviser and coordinator for dissident
actions. He only moved to help organize the party last month.
	   Xu and another prominent Democracy Wall figure and party
principal, Qin Yongmin, were arrested Nov. 30 in police raids in
two different cities. Wang was already in custody.
	   Police in southwestern Sichuan province detained three
dissidents in two cities Tuesday and all three _ Liu Xianbin, Yu
Wanbao and Ouyang Yi _ remained in custody Wednesday, the Hong
Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement reported.
	   Liu was a member of a coordinating committee of party supporters
in 14 provinces and cities set up after the crackdown started last
week, New York-based Human Rights in China reported.
	   He in turn set up an information office with Yu and Ouyang to
draft and fax statements to Chinese officials and dissidents, Human
Rights in China said.
	   In one fax sent Sunday, the dissidents called on the Supreme
People's Court to ensure Wang receives a fair public trial in
Intermediate People's Court in the eastern city of Hangzhou, Human
Rights in China said.

In Puerto Rico's heartland, divisions and confusion before vote
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OROCOVIS, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Far from all the hyperbole in San
Juan, residents in Puerto Rico's mountainous rural heartland are
facing Sunday's political status vote with a lot of division and
not a little confusion.
	   Unlike general election campaigns here, the referendum on Puerto
Rico's ties to the United States has yet to seize the popular
imagination in Orocovis, a town of 24,000 about 30 miles (50 kms)
southwest of San Juan that bills itself as the ``heart of Puerto
Rico.''
	   One reason cited by residents: a confusing array of five
political options on the ballot, including independence, U.S.
statehood and a ``None of the Above'' option supported by the
opposition Popular Democratic Party, which favors the existing
``commonwealth'' status.
	   Some residents also say the vote comes too soon after Hurricane
Georges, which damaged coffee and banana fields in the lush,
steep-sided mountains that surround Orocovis and destroyed about
1,000 homes on Sept. 21.
	   Locally, as many as 200 people a day are still seeking help or
following up on aid applications with the U.S. Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
	   Pro-statehood Gov. Pedro Rossello called the vote in July in
hopes of prompting the U.S. Congress to address what he contends is
an outdated and non-democratic relationship. Puerto Ricans cannot
vote for president or Congress, but they can be drafted into the
U.S. military.
	   But with crews still repairing bridges and roads damaged by the
storm, island politicians haven't had the time to make clear what
each option means for Puerto Rico, Orocovis residents said.
	   ``Estamos confused,'' conceded construction worker Enrique
Suarez, 55, his mixing of two languages for ``We are confused''
reflecting many Puerto Ricans' ambivalence over English-speaking
America.
	   ``I don't know much about statehood. I like things the way they
are,'' Suarez said Tuesday.
	   That fear of the unknown was echoed by others in Orocovis, even
though many have lived much of their lives in places like Buffalo,
Jersey City and New York City and have a strong affinity for the
United States.
	   ``We are in crisis. For me it's not the time to hold a
referendum,'' said grocery owner Miguel Morales, 64, a former New
Yorker whose business has suffered since some of his neighbors on
cloud-shrouded hilltops lost their homes to Hurricane Georges.
	   ``I don't oppose a vote, but pick a later date so that Puerto
Rico can regain normality,'' Morales said.
	   In Orocovis, the pressures that come with a 24 percent
unemployment rate and dependence on seasonal work like harvesting
coffee, bananas and fruit appear to have taken precedence over the
holiday season's politics.
	   Government is the town's largest employer, generating more than
3,000 jobs. Others work at an Eastpak backpack factory or a few
dozen downtown stores and restaurants.
	   Still, pro-statehood Mayor Jesus Edgardo Colon Berlingeri
predicts a strong turnout of 75 percent of the town's 16,000
registered voters and a victory for statehood in Orocovis.
	   ``We must support statehood'' because of the high unemployment,
Colon Berlingeri said. ``The amount of aid will go up with
statehood.''
	   Both Colon Berlingeri's New Progressive Party and the
pro-commonwealth Popular Democratic Party are counting on Puerto
Rico's tradition of party-line voting to overcome confusion over
the ballot and get supporters to the polls.
	   Some last-minute campaigning, including a streetside rally and a
van with a massive, rooftop speaker blaring pro-statehood songs,
may also fire enthusiasm for Sunday's vote, party activists hope.
	   For many residents in a town that spawned famed salsa musician
Bobby Valentin, merengue's Manny Manuel and singer Andres Jimenez,
party loyalty will suffice at the polls on Sunday.
	   ``I'm a statehooder until death!'' exclaimed Rafael Rosa Ortiz,
80, while chatting with several younger, unemployed friends on a
bench in Orocovis' central square.
	   ``I'm a `Populare (pronounced po-pu-LAH-ray),''' countered
Hipolito Rivera, a 43-year-old jobless construction worker,
referring to his devotion to the pro-commonwealth party. ``I will
always vote for `None of the Above.'''

China takes three more shooting golds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China won three of the day's four
shooting medals at the Asian Games Wednesday, and missed the fourth
only because luck was against it under a tie-breaking formula.
	   In the women's sport rifle team competition, the Japanese and
Chinese tied at 1,754. Under the tie-breaking formula, officials
then looked at the sixth and final round. That also was tied, but
Japan won the gold on the basis of a better fifth round _ 293 to
291.
	   Thailand won the bronze with 1,745.
	   In the individual event, China's Wang Xian won gold with 589.
Japan's Yoko Minamoto took the silver with 586 and teammate Noriko
Ojima won the bronze with 585.
	   China placed 1-2 in the men's air pistol shooting. Xu Dan's
685.0 won the gold and Tan Zongliang's 683.6 the silver.
Kazakstan's Vladimir Guchsha took the bronze with 682.6.
	   In the team event, China won with 1,742 to 1,723 for Japan and
1,721 for South Korea.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Police seized 2 million pounds (dlrs 3.2 million)
worth of drugs and arrested three men in an undercover operation in
a southwest London suburb, police said Wednesday.
	   Surrey police, working with the National Crime Squad, seized the
drugs in a series of raids on Monday. The drugs found included two
batches of ecstasy, one of 100,000 tablets and the other of 49,000
tablets, police said. Also seized were 34 kilos (75 pounds) of
cannabis resin and 11 kilos (24 pounds) of amphetamine sulphate,
police said.
	   The drug raids were part of a long-term operation code-named
Neath. Two of the men were arrested in a car in Byfleet, Surrey, 20
miles (30 km) southwest of central London, police said. The third
man, and a woman who was later released, were arrested during raids
at four addresses in Guildford, police said.
	   All three men were being questioned Wednesday.

Dalai Lama credits Chirac with showing concern for Tibet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Dalai Lama on Wednesday credited French
President Jacques Chirac with showing sympathy for the Tibetan
cause.
	   The Tibetan spiritual leader, in Paris for a 50th anniversary
celebration of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, told
Europe-1 radio his meeting with Chirac had been ``warm and
friendly.''
	   He described Chirac as his ``old friend,'' saying he ``always
shows sympathy.''
	   ``When Chirac visited China, he mentioned the Tibet question and
he tried to convince the Chinese government to start a dialogue,''
the exiled leader added.
	   The Dalai Lama also renewed his call for a dialogue with Chinese
leaders. ``For the past 20 years, I have always said I was ready to
start a dialogue,'' he said.
	   On Tuesday, Beijing pressed Chirac to drop his lunch plans with
the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize winner, one of a group of Nobel
laureates invited to meet the French President.
	   Chirac, however, went ahead with the lunch at his Elysee Palace,
saying the Dalai Lama is a respected religious figure.
	   France, which has sought to avoid friction with China in an
effort to expand commercial ties, defended its position. But it
also affirmed Tibet should remain part of China.
	   The Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising
against Chinese rule, has been campaigning for greater autonomy for
the Himalayan region.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with price of Astra shares rising. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Sweden's Astra and Britain's Zeneca
announced Wednesday that they will merge, bringing together two
mid-sized drug makers best known for their pain relief products.
	   Company officials said the deal, which had been rumored for
months, would lead to significant cost savings but also eliminate
6,000 jobs. The new company, called AstraZeneca, has annual sales
of nearly dlrs 16 billion and a total stock value of dlrs 67
billion.
	   ``AstraZeneca combines the best of two innovative companies with
successful track records of organic growth,'' Percy Barnevik,
nominated to be chairman, said in a statement released by Astra.
	   Barnevik is the head of Investor AB, the investment arm of
Sweden's Wallenberg family, which owns 12 percent of Astra.
	   Zeneca CEO Tom McKillop, who is to hold the same title for the
new company, said in the same statement that ``Astra and Zeneca are
a perfect fit.''
	   Upon news of the merger, Astra's shares were up 12 percent, to
169 kronor (dlrs 21), in early trading on the Stockholm exchange.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Facing one of the toughest tests of its short
tenure, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's government gathered
Wednesday to work out what will be an austere budget in 1999.
	   Primakov convened his top ministers behind closed doors, first
to discuss military spending and then to take on the rest of the
budget, which is estimated at 575 billion rubles (dlrs 29 billion).
	   The government was not expected to have an easy time hammering
out the document. Russia faces massive debts to international
lenders and state workers on one side, and seriously shrinking
revenues on the other.
	   Primakov has acknowledged the government will probably not be
able to pay off all of its dlrs 17.5 billion in foreign debt next
year, but he is still promising to pay off all state workers.
	   If Primakov is to meet his obligations to the country's workers,
the government probably will have to print more money, an action
that will stoke inflation.
	   The International Monetary Fund and other lenders have already
frozen a dlrs 22.6 billion loan package, which Russia is desperate
to receive. Some budget projections even factor in the loans as
part of 1999 revenues.
	   The loans aside, initial projections show that the government
will cut expenditures drastically and try to streamline the
country's unwieldy tax system.
	   According to the Interfax news agency, the latest version of the
budget raises the 1999 estimate for the country's output from 3.8
trillion rubles (dlrs 190 billion) to 4 trillion rubles (dlrs 200
billion).
	   Interfax also projected that 32.6 billion rubles (dlrs 1.6
billion) would be printed to cover a portion of the budget deficit,
which is expected to exceed 100 billion rubles (dlrs 20 billion).
	   Many top officials were expecting swift passage for the budget.
Compared to previous governments, Primakov's team generally has
support in the Communist-dominated State Duma, or lower house.
	   ``Bearing in mind that Primakov enjoys such widespread
confidence, he is able to introduce a tough budget,'' said former
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, the leader of the Our Home is
Russia political movement.
	   Chernomyrdin praised early drafts of the 1999 budget, calling it
a dose of much-needed belt tightening.
	   ``It is the first time such a tough budget is presented,'' he
said. ``It is time to stop pumping air into the budget and
suffering from that later.
	   Primakov's full cabinet will meet Thursday, when it is expected
to approve the final budget draft and pass it along to the Duma for
approval.

Supreme Court annuls army exemptions for rabbinical students
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's Supreme Court on Wednesday nullified a
controversial exemption for ultra-Orthodox Jewish men from army
service, posing a new threat to the government's already shaky
existence.
	   Unanimously ruling the arrangement ``illegal,'' the 11-judge
court gave Israel's parliament a year to work out a new
arrangement. Otherwise, the panel threatened to make its own rules.
	   Parties representing the ultra-Orthodox Jews have threatened to
bring down Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government
if any change is made to the arrangement exempting students at
religious seminaries from military service.
	   Netanyahu is already struggling to survive a no-confidence vote
scheduled in two weeks on the stalled peace process with the
Palestinians. The opposition is edging close to the 61 legislators
it needs to oust his government.
	   When Israel's first prime minister David Ben Gurion agreed to
the exemptions 50 years ago _ securing support for the state from
the then-non-Zionist ultra-Orthodox community _ the number was
about 600. Today about 30,000 yeshiva students have draft
exemptions.
	   In order to qualify for the exemption, the students _ who
receive a monthly government stipend _ are not allowed to work.
	   Israeli reporters have repeatedly turned up large numbers of
Orthodox Jews with army exemptions working instead of studying.
	   A legislator for the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, Shlomo Ben Izri,
acknowledged ``isolated abuses'' in the system, but declared: ``No
power in the world will force yeshiva students into the army.''
	   The court was ruling on a suit filed by two secular legislators.
University students have also filed a suit, demanding cancellation
of exemptions for yeshiva students.
	   Israeli university students _ who ended a six-week strike over
tuition fees this week _ have complained that they serve three
years in the army, up to a month reserves duty each year and pay
thousands of dollars in tuition.
	   By contrast, they say, yeshiva students get free educations and
do not serve in the army.
	   The ultra-Orthodox say that the exemption is necessary to
guarantee the perpetuation of a culture of religious study that was
almost wiped out during the Holocaust.
	   Ben Izri suggested that an agreed-upon limit on the number of
exemptions ``would not be a problem.''

Central banker sees further weakening of European economies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Europe's economies are set to weaken
further but a recession is unlikely, a top European central banker
said.
	   Otmar Issing, who sits on the European Central Bank's six-member
executive board, said some data ``signal a further weakening of the
economy.'' But, he added, ``this won't result in a recession from
today's point of view.''
	   Speaking to journalists Tuesday night in Frankfurt, Issing said
the euro-zone wasn't in a time of deflation. Although inflation at
1 percent is low, ``it doesn't signal deflation. ... Prices are
stable,'' Issing said, though he added price decreases were
``possible.''
	   Issing also praised coordinated interest rate cuts last week in
the 11 European countries launching the euro on Jan. 1, saying the
move had removed uncertainty from the euro's launch.
	   The cuts ``were intended to give markets the signal that the new
ECB is capable of acting,'' Issing said, terming them a ``wise
decision.''
	   Most analysts had expected the rate cuts to be announced at the
end of the month, but the delay could have increased political
pressure for a rate cut as Europe's growth flagged, he said.
	   The German and French governments had been pressing hard for
rate cuts, though the ECB said its decision was not linked to the
pressure.

 &UR; Students and police clash near president's home in Indonesia
 &UR; AP Photos

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Riot police clashed with about 200
students near President B.J. Habibie's house Wednesday hours after
state prosecutors questioned ex-President Suharto over allegations
of massive corruption.
	   Police said 31 students were arrested outside the headquarters
of a charitable foundation formerly controlled by Suharto.
	   Some of the students, who want Suharto put on trial, threw rocks
at officers, witnesses said.
	   The building is about 500 meters (yards) away from Habibie's
home, which was heavily guarded.
	   Two students were injured, witnesses said.
	   Another group of students were blocked by police on a toll road
when they tried to march on Habibie's home about one kilometer (a
half mile) away in south Jakarta.
	   At least five other demonstrations were staged in various spots
in the capital, which was under a tight security clampdown because
of Suharto's questioning.
	   The biggest protest on Wednesday was held was outside the
Jakarta police headquarters where more than 1,000 students demanded
the release of two fellow activists in detention.
	   The two were arrested on Tuesday and have been accused of
briefly abducting of a plainclothes police officer last month.
	   The protesters tore down a fence near the headquarters' main
gate.
	   ``Release our fellow students,'' chanted the protesters.
	   They also unfurled banners demanding the Suharto's trial and the
dissolution of Parliament.

Swiss lawmakers elect country's first female president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss politicians on Wednesday elected
Interior Minister Ruth Dreifuss as the country's president for
1999, making her the first woman ever to lead the Swiss government.
	   Dreifuss, 58, of the left-of-center Social Democrats, replaces
Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti in the largely ceremonial post, which
rotates on an annual basis between the seven members of the
coalition cabinet.
	   An assembly of the two houses of parliament approved Dreifuss'
appointment in a secret ballot by 158 votes out of a possible 210.
	   Defense Minister Adolf Ogi will be her deputy, putting him line
to assume the presidency in 2000.
	   Dreifuss in 1993 became only the second woman to be elected to
the Federal Council, or cabinet, and is its only female member.
	   Dreifuss also becomes the country's first Jewish president. Her
religion, however, was unrelated to her selection. She has kept a
low profile during the recent controversy over Swiss banks' role in
hiding wealth looted by the Nazis during World War II.
	   Dreifuss, an economist and expert on social security, is in
control of health and social issues. She has overseen Switzerland's
drug policy, introducing measures to give heroin to long-term
addicts.

SAfrican researchers say 3-million-year-old human skeleton found
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos JOH101-104 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ In a find called
``momentous,'' researchers Wednesday said they had discovered the
first complete skeleton of a human ancestor dating back more than 3
million years.
	   The find stems from the discovery four years ago of ankle and
foot bones mistakenly labeled animal fossils at the University of
the Witwatersrand. Researcher Ron Clarke at the time said the bones
belonged to an ape-man known as Australopithecus, which had both
human and apelike features.
	   Following up on the find, Clarke and his team identified what
they say is the rest of the skeleton. They said they discovered the
remaining bones and skull in university cupboards and by revisiting
the cave near Johannesburg where the foot bones came from.
	   The find of a complete Australopithecus skeleton will help
researchers fill the gaps in other discoveries, Clarke said. The
3.6 million-year-old creature lived in a wooded area and was
capable of climbing trees, he said.
	   Previously, the most complete early hominid was ``Lucy,'' an
Australopithecus whose partial skeleton was discovered in 1974 in
Ethiopia. The oldest complete skeleton before this latest discovery
dates back to 1.8 million years, Clarke said. It was that of a Homo
Erectus, found in Kenya.
	   This is ``probably the most momentous find ever made in
Africa,'' said Philip Tobias, professor emeritus of the
Witwatersrand anatomy department, who has been involved in string
of finds.
	   Much of the latest skeleton remains embedded in fossil rock at
the Sterkfontein Caves.
	   Clarke's findings were due to be published Thursday in the
journal Nature. They appeared Wednesday in the South African
Journal of Science.

Indonesian prosecutors question Suharto as students protest

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Facing allegations of massive
corruption over three decades in power, former President Suharto
was questioned by state prosecutors Wednesday amid a huge security
clampdown.
	   Later, police near the home of Suharto's successor, President
B.J. Habibie, clashed with hundreds of students who rejected the
government probe as cosmetic.
	   Dressed in a traditional batik shirt, 77-year-old Suharto smiled
after emerging with eight defense lawyers from four hours of
questioning.
	   Six investigators from the office of Indonesia's attorney
general asked him 43 questions about the source of his wealth. But
it remains unclear if Suharto will ever face prosecution.
	   ``No one is above the law,'' Suharto said softly before a throng
of reporters at the Jakarta High Attorney's Office. ``But every
citizen has the right to be protected by the law.''
	   ``I have answered all the questions and I am prepared to give
further explanation if the attorney general's office wishes,'' said
Suharto, who lives as a virtual recluse in his Jakarta home.
	   Convinced that the government is too beholden to Suharto to
conduct a thorough probe, students who want the former
authoritarian leader to be put on trial staged several protests
around Jakarta.
	   Anti-riot officers with sticks and shields pushed students away
from the headquarters of a charitable foundation that was formerly
controlled by Suharto and allegedly used to siphon off state money.
	   Police detained 31 students for allegedly not having a permit to
stage the demonstration, which was about 500 meters (yards) from
Habibie's private residence. Two students were injured.
	   More than 1,000 students also rallied outside Jakarta's police
headquarters to demand the release of two activists who were
arrested and accused of abducting a plainclothes officer at a Nov.
27 rally. The officer was released after several hours.
	   Troops and armored personnel carriers blocked off main roads,
causing traffic chaos. Security was especially tight around
Suharto's house, a frequent target in recent weeks of pro-democracy
protesters who helped oust the president in May after 32 years in
power.
	   Riots over price increases caused by Indonesia's worst economic
crisis in decades had also eroded Suharto's once-impregnable
authority.
	   Critics have complained that Habibie has stalled efforts to
investigate his predecessor and one-time mentor because he and many
government officials are also suspected of graft during the Suharto
era.
	   Student protester Alex Joyo dismissed the Suharto summons as a
mere formality. A real investigation, he said, would ``drag down a
lot of Suharto cronies, including within Habibie's government.''
	   Suharto's legal adviser, Yohanes Yacob, said last week that
senior government officials could be dragged into ``messy
litigation'' if the former president is brought to court.
	   The interview focused on multi-million dollar charitable
foundations formerly under his control, a national car project run
by one of his sons with massive tax breaks, the contents of his
banks accounts and presidential decrees that allegedly benefited
his family and friends.
	   A spokesman for Attorney General Andi Mohammad Ghalib, who is a
three-star army general, said Suharto might be summoned again.
	   Suharto has been accused of draining the state of resources to
benefit the business empires of his children and associates,
thereby aggravating the country's economic malaise.
	   Forbes magazine this year estimated Suharto's wealth at dlrs 4
billion. Others say it is much higher.
	   Previously Suharto has denied any wrongdoing and has repeatedly
scoffed at accusations that he has stashed billions of dollars in
overseas bank accounts.
	   It was the third time since his resignation that Suharto has
been questioned by state lawyers, who earlier said they had found
no evidence of wrongdoing. Students said the process was a
whitewash, and Habibie revived the investigation after a wave of
protests.
	   State prosecutors investigating alleged corruption also
questioned Mohamad ``Bob'' Hasan, a former trade and industry
minister, for eight hours at the office of Ghalib, the attorney
general.
	   Hasan, a one-time golfing buddy of Suharto, is a business tycoon
with big interests in the timber industry.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Students joined teachers in marches around
Greece on Wednesday in an escalation of protests against government
education reforms.
	   The mounting opposition has created another serious headache for
the government of Premier Costas Simitis, which is struggling to
push through austerity measures demanded by the European Union.
	   An estimated 10,000 demonstrators rallied in Athens, chanting
slogans against Education Minister Gerasimos Arsenis. They demanded
the immediate repeal of the reforms to shake up the hiring and
marking systems.
	   Teachers also staged a 24-hour strike Wednesday, while children
are occupying hundreds of high school buildings in a two-week
campaign. Students have also been staging daily roadblocks on busy
roads used by commuters.
	   Arsenis has ruled out abandoning the reforms, but conceded for
the fist time this week that there may be room for improvement. He
charged that students were being ``deliberately misinformed'' about
the reforms by teachers and private night schools, which most Greek
children attend to keep up with classes.
	   Teachers oppose changes in hiring policies that scraps a waiting
list system in favor of ranking according to exam results. The
students face a new university entrance system that gives more
weight to a series of tests rather than a single exam.
	   Greeks have a constitutional right to free schooling and
university, but education receives little public funding. Teachers
have for years been campaigning for better pay and work conditions.
	   They argue that schools are too poorly equipped for the reforms
to work.
	   The waves of strikes and protests apparently reflect eroding
support for the Simitis government, according to a nationwide poll
published Wednesday.
	   The Socialists fell 6.5 percentage points behind the main
opposition New Democracy conservative party. There was no margin of
error.

Ukrainian president signs decree to assist flood-stricken area
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ President Leonid Kuchma signed a decree to
set up a special economic zone in a western region that was hit by
devastating floods last month, a news report said Wednesday.
	   Kuchma signed the document Tuesday during a visit to
Zakarpattia, where November floods inundated around 100 villages
and claimed at least 17 lives.
	   More than 2,000 houses were fully destroyed in the flooding and
thousands of people were evacuated from Zakarpattia and other
western areas.
	   The decree grants tax breaks and other benefits for investments
in the area, along with other steps to boost economic activity, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   Kuchma also ordered his Cabinet to devise a state program for
combating similar floods in the future that would involve, in part,
cleaning river beds in western Ukraine.
	   Ukraine's government has allocated 10 million hryvna (dlrs 2.9
million) for the flood relief effort, and businesses across the
country have provided help.
	   ``Joining forces in the face of calamity, Ukraine showed that it
can solve a national problem together,'' Kuchma said.
	   A number of nations, as well as international organizations
including the Red Cross and United Nations, have sent aid to
Zakarpattia.

Ukrainian president approves World Bank loan agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ President Leonid Kuchma signed a draft law
ratifying a dlrs 200 million World Bank loan to modernize Kiev's
heating system, but financial trouble may delay the deal, the mayor
of Kiev said.
	   Kuchma signed the deal Monday, and Ukraine's parliament must now
ratify the document, the mayor, Oleksandr Omelchenko, said in
comments cited Wednesday by the Interfax news agency.
	   Even if parliament ratifies the 20-year, dlrs 200 million loan,
it is unclear whether Ukraine will see the money soon.
	   World Bank loan projects depend on the International Monetary
Fund's approval of the Ukrainian government's reform policy. The
IMF froze its loans to the country last week because of stalled
reforms.
	   That delay automatically put off further disbursement of the
World Bank's separate aid package.
	   The heating loan would repair old and build new boiler houses,
make improvements in the city's power plants and provide for better
management of the heating system as a whole.
	   Kiev's heating system is the third-largest in the former Soviet
Union after Moscow and St. Petersburg, providing heat and hot water
to most of the capital's estimated 3.5 million residents and its
industries.
	   Ukrainian authorities lacked the necessary funds to maintain
that system following the Soviet collapse in 1991, and many pipes
have suffered from corrosion.
	   Omelchenko estimated the entire renovation project at dlrs 249.4
million, and said the rest would be provided by city authorities
and the capital's Kyivenergo company.

Central Asians win canoe races, more bad news for Chinese swimming
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with men's gymnastics, controversy over North Koreans;
will be updated with later events &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Asian Games officials were
investigating Wednesday whether some of North Korea's female
gymnasts were underage, while the Chinese gymnasts just kept
collecting gold medals.
	   In earlier canoe and kayak racing, three or four minutes of
furious paddling at a Thai resort earned three gold medals for
Kazakstan and one for Uzbekistan.
	   China's victories were tempered by more bad news for its swim
team.
	   After being shut out of the golds in Tuesday night's swimming
session, the Chinese learned that world champion Chen Yan was too
sick to compete in the 400-meter freestyle Wednesday. Chen also had
missed the dismal Tuesday session because of stomach problems.
	   Illness also hit Sri Lanka sprinter Susantika Jayasinghe, who
has been counting on these games to resume her career after
questions about whether she took a banned drug. A team official
said she was running a fever and feeling weak.
	   The investigation of the North Korean gymnasts came after
coaches from rival teams, as well as doctors and officials, had
raised questions about whether the tiny girls met the minimum age
requirement of 16.
	   North Korea's gymnasts have not won any medals, but China's so
far have swept the men's and women's team events and the
competition to decide the top male all-around gymnast.
	   In the all-around Wednesday, Huang Xu, 19, a veteran of China's
1997 World Championship team, won gold with 57.825 points, 0.225
ahead of teammate Yang Wei and 0.450 ahead of Japan's Naoya
Tsukahara, the son of five-time Olympic gold medalist Mitsuo
Tsukahara.
	   The Chinese also had three shooting golds and one in canoeing in
Wednesday's early events, giving them 18 far in the 3-day-old
games. Japan added one shooting gold and had 13. South Korea had
eight and Kazakstan six.
	   Uzbekistan's gold was its first of these games for the former
Soviet republic. In the four-man kayak race over 1,000 meters,
Uzbekistan pulled ahead of Kazakstan in the second 250 meters and
won in 3 minutes, 10.44 seconds to 3:11.78 for Kazakstan.
	   Kazakstan won the one- and two-man kayak races and the two-man
canoe competition, while China took the one-man canoe race in a
reservoir at the seaside resort of Pattaya.
	   In the day's closest race, Kazakstan's Sergey Sergin took an
early lead but had to spurt over the last 250 meters to hold off
China's Jiang Yuguo by less than a second in the one-man kayaks.
	   China won three of the day's four golds in shooting, while Japan
beat China for the women's rifle team gold based on a tie-break
formula.
	   The Japanese and Chinese teams both scored 1,754 points, and the
scores for the sixth and final round also were tied, but Japan won
the gold based on a better fifth round. Thailand won the bronze
with 1,745.
	   China's Wang Xian won the individual rifle gold with 589 points,
ahead of two Japanese _ Yoko Minamoto, who had 586, and Noriko
Ojima, who had 585.
	   China placed 1-2 in the men's air pistol shooting. Xu Dan's
685.0 won the gold and Tan Zongliang's 683.6 the silver.
Kazakstan's Vladimir Guchsha took the bronze with 682.6.
	   In the team event, China won with 1,742 to 1,723 for Japan and
1,721 for South Korea.
	   Thailand's Saran Suwansa was hurt in the competition to decide
the best all-around gymnast. He failed to complete a final twist on
a somersault off the vault and appeared to wrench his knee as he
landed awkwardly. He lay on the mat for a while before he was taken
away on a stretcher, holding his head in pain. His condition was
not immediately known.

Olympic gymnast returns to court to keep father away permanently
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TERRI LANGFORD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ Fearful for her life, gymnast Dominique Moceanu
is returning to court to have a restraining order against her
father made permanent.
	   The 17-year-old was granted a temporary restraining order
against her father a week ago. She has asked state District Judge
John Montgomery to upgrade that order and make it a permanent
injunction.
	   Both Moceanu and her parents, Dumitru and Camelia Moceanu, were
expected to attend Wednesday's hearing.
	   If Moceanu's adolescence seemed unbearable, it apparently was
idyllic compared to the gymnast's new life as a grownup.
	   Since Oct. 28, when a judge granted her request for adult
status, the 1996 gold medalist says she's endured verbal threats
and stalking by her father. Police are also investigating a private
investigator's claim that Dumitru Moceanu offered to pay dlrs
10,000 to have a friend and her coach killed.
	   ``The threat of danger from my father hangs over me every day,''
the gymnast said in court papers filed a week ago for the
restraining order.
	   Messages left Tuesday with her father's attorney, Katherine
Scardino, and at his workplace were not returned to The Associated
Press. Moceanu has, so far, declined the AP's request for an
interview about her court battles.
	   What began as a teen-age athlete's fight for control over her
millions in earnings has escalated into a vitriolic fight
threatening to shatter her family for good.
	   ``It's just awful,'' Moceanu's publicist, Janey Miller, said
Tuesday. ``It is literally tearing them apart.''
	   The stormy relationship between father and daughter caught
public notice in late October, when she fled from her home with the
help of Marcy and Brian Huggins and her coach, Luminita Miscenco.
Huggins befriended the Olympian while performing some work at the
dlrs 4 million Moceanu Gymnastics Inc. facility north of Houston.
	   The Huggins have also received a restraining order against
Dumitru Moceanu.
	   Encouraged by fellow athletes, including gymnast Kurt Thomas, to
take more control of her finances, Moceanu dogged her father and
mother for answers about how her earnings, secured in a trust fund
that they alone have access to, were being spent.
	   ``I kill myself training and going to school, and what is he
doing with my money?'' Moceanu told the Houston Chronicle at the
time. ``They haven't been working since 1996. Where does their
income come from? Me.''
	   After months of stonewalling, the young athlete decided that her
only alternative was the courtroom. With her coach by her side, the
gymnast gathered her courage and phoned an attorney from a shopping
mall pay phone. Within days, she sued her parents, asking a judge
for adult status so she could legally begin asking for an
accounting of how her trust fund was spent.
	   She also revealed how her every move was monitored by her
father, that she had yet to go unchaperoned on a date. She also
revealed that her father has hit her ``a couple of times'' and that
she ``never had a childhood.''
	   Dumitru and Camelia Moceanu, both Romanian immigrants, fueled
her Olympic dream starting at age 3. They brought her to Houston so
she could be coached by Bela Karolyi.
	   At 14, Moceanu was the youngest American ever to win an Olympic
gold medal in gymnastics during the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta.
	   With earnings generated by public appearances and competition,
her parents built a 70,000 square-foot (6,500 sq. meters) gym just
north of Houston a few years ago.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The U.S. envoy for Kosovo headed
back to the region Wednesday to try to revive the stalled peace
process for the embattled Yugoslav province.
	   Christopher Hill, who is also the U.S. ambassador to neighboring
Macedonia, was due to meet members of the ethnic Albanian
negotiating team and the political representative for the
province's separatist guerrillas.
	   The United States and its allies are urging the Serbs and ethnic
Albanians to compromise after both sides rejected Washington's
latest peace plan.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also criticized the
two sides, warning the Serbs to stop threats of new offensives and
telling the ethnic Albanians to abandon their ``rhetoric of
independence.''
	   Last week, Hill offered a revised formula for greater self-rule
for Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's Serb republic, with a
majority ethnic Albanian population.

China's gymnasts take all-around gold at Asian Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meeting with North Koreans inconclusive, quotes,
other details; edits to trim &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A veteran and a newcomer scored a 1-2
for China on Wednesday in the Asian Games men's gymnastics
all-around competition, as controversy erupted over North Korea's
team of diminutive women gymnasts.
	   While Huang Xu collected gold, organizers met North Korean
officials to check whether their gymnasts were underage.
	   Officials said they wanted to check the North Koreans' passports
to see if they had all reached the minimum age of 16. Coaches from
rival teams, as well as doctors and officials, questioned the
girls' ages after seeing them in competition Tuesday.
	   ``We are going to investigate,'' said Wei Jizhong, chairman of
the Olympic Committee of Asia's standing committee. ``If you want
to check, you have to check their passports, there's no other
way.''
	   In the competition, Huang's all-around gold maintained China's
unblemished gymnastics record, after both the men and women had
retained the team titles they have held without a break since 1974.
China was looking for more gold later Wednesday in the women's
all-around, and on Thursday in the apparatus finals.
	   ``I'm very pleased,'' said Huang. ``All of us could have taken
gold, it just depended who did best on the day.''
	   Yang Wei, an 18-year-old newcomer to the Chinese team, collected
silver in his first major competition. The bronze went to Naoya
Tsukahara of Japan, the son of five-time Olympic gold medalist
Mitsuo Tsukahara.
	   ``So-so,'' said the elder Tsukahara when asked to evaluate his
son's performance. ``He wanted gold.''
	   Huang, 19, is a veteran of China's 1997 World Championship team.
He was all muscular control on the rings, barely wobbling as he
completed an impressive routine that scored 9.7, and was
consistently good throughout the five other disciplines.
	   Huang had gone into his final event, the pommel horse, trailing
his teammate Yang by just 0.025. He clinched gold with a nearly
flawless display that scored 9.725, his highest mark of the day,
for a final score of 57.825.
	   Yang had 57.600 and Tsukahara 57.375.
	   Organizers decided to examine the North Koreans' passports after
an official from the Asian Gymnastics Union queried the age of
their women.
	   ``She said I think we better check because their faces look very
young. They don't look 16,'' said Suebsai Boonveerabut, the
competition organizer.
	   But the meeting with the North Koreans shortly after Huang took
gold proved inconclusive because the women's passports were with
another North Korean official who had gone to the airport to meet
someone, she said.
	   The North Koreans were told to produce the passports by
midnight, and the women were allowed to carry on competing, but
their results would be voided if they were later found to be
underage, she said.
	   Halfway through the competition, Thailand's Saran Suwansa was
taken off on a stretcher, clutching his head in pain, after he
landed heavily on a failed vault. He failed to complete a final
twist on a somersault off the vault and appeared to wrench his knee
as he landed awkwardly. His condition was not immediately known.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A chartered Egyptian airliner was hijacked
Wednesday after taking off from Tunis, Tunisia, and ordered to fly
to neighboring Libya, an airport official said. But police said the
craft landed in Jerba, Tunisia.
	   The hijackers demanded to go to Libya, a police official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity. He said the craft's pilot had
reported the incident to Egyptian officials.
	   The hijackers have left the craft but were refusing to speak to
authorities, the police official said. The passengers on the plane
included Libyans.
	   It was not clear why the craft landed in Jerba, an island 350
kilometers (210 miles) south of the capital Tunis.
	   According to police, the craft was chartered by a Lebanese
company from EgyptAir, the Egyptian national carrier. The name of
the Lebanese company was not immediately known.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ He was one of the most powerful men in
Asia until protesting students hounded him from office a little
over six months ago.
	   Now former President Suharto is at the center of a corruption
inquiry that goes to the heart of attempts to reform Indonesia as
it grapples with political turmoil and ethnic and religious strife
fueled by the worst economic crisis in decades.
	   Its hands forced by a new wave of student protests, the
government has ordered a fresh investigation into Suharto's wealth.
	   State lawyers questioned Suharto in a prosecutor's office
Wednesday in downtown Jakarta, and officials warned he could be
placed under house arrest if he does not cooperate.
	   Still, many doubt the resolve of the government, dominated by
former Suharto supporters, to move against the old leader.
	   In recent weeks, students have stepped up protests after an
earlier government inquiry found no evidence against the
77-year-old Suharto.
	   Critics said that a probe by Attorney General Andi Mohammad
Ghalib was a whitewash. Now under pressure, Suharto's successor and
one-time protege, President B.J. Habibie, has ordered Ghalib to try
again.
	   It's doubtful the new inquiry will placate the students who have
accused Ghalib, a three-star army general, of going soft on
Suharto, himself a retired general.
	   Virtually every day hundreds, sometimes thousands, have
attempted to march on Suharto's heavily guarded home.
	   Always blocked by troops, some demand he be hanged. Most say he
should be sent to court and tried immediately, not just for graft
but for human rights abuses.
	   A security clampdown was enforced Wednesday around central
Jakarta.
	   Suharto smiled and waved after he emerged from four hours
questioning at the Jakarta High Attorney's office, which was
heavily guarded by riot police.
	   Speaking to reporters, he said he had answered all questions put
to him and would be willing to answer more if required.
	   Later thousands students defied police and troops and staged
several big protests, one not far from Habibie's house.
	   Nine students were shot and killed by security forces when they
tried to march on Parliament in November. Much of Jakarta was
wrecked or burned when riots broke out in May and claimed 1,200
lives, prompting Suharto to quit.
	   Suharto scoffs at accusations that he stashed billions of
dollars overseas and claims he has ``not one cent'' squirreled away
in foreign bank accounts.
	   He says he is worth about dlrs 3 million, far less than an
estimate earlier this year by Forbes magazine that put his wealth
at dlrs 4 billion. Others say it is even higher.
	   For weeks investigators have been compiling lists of assets
belonging to the Suharto clan, including hundreds of thousands of
acres of holdings across this sprawling Southeast Asian nation of
about 17,000 islands.
	   Suharto's six children are among Indonesia's wealthiest people
and head huge business empires that flourished under his patronage.
	   In the months since their father's downfall they have been the
target of separate corruption probes. Two of Suharto's sons have
been banned from leaving the country as investigators unravel their
business dealings.
	   Meanwhile companies controlled by their siblings have been
stripped of many lucrative government contracts and monopolies.
	   Habibie has promised to root out corruption and nepotism, which
international agencies like the World Bank say have worsened
Indonesia's economic woes.
	   But many critics say the government's links to the old leader
will prevent it from prosecuting him.
	   Even those in the ex-president's camp doubt the determination of
Habibie, a friend of Suharto for four decades and his Cabinet
minister for 20 years.
	   ``If Suharto does go to court, it could drag down the
government, bringing senior incumbent and former officials _ as
well as all the cronies suspected of accruing ill-gotten wealth _
into messy litigation,'' Suharto's legal advisor, Yohanes Yacob,
said last week.
	   The corruption allegations hang over Suharto at a dramatic time
for Indonesia, which was hit hard by Asia's financial meltdown.
	   A deep recession has entered its second year. Millions of people
have lost their jobs and have slipped into poverty. The annual
inflation rate is running at 80 percent. Crime is climbing.
	   Looting and riots break out sporadically, and relations between
the Muslim majority and the Christian minority, kept in check by
Suharto's iron-fisted policies, have deteriorated.

Saudi authorities free London-based dissident's sister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ The sister of exiled Saudi Arabian
dissident Mohammad al-Massari has been released from detention, an
Islamic human rights group said in a statement Wednesday.
	   Suha al-Massari, 33, was freed Tuesday and is now at her
family's home in the Saudi capital Riyadh, the London-based Islamic
Observation Center said.
	   The center, an advocacy group for human rights for Moslems
around the world, urged Saudi Arabia to release all political
prisoners.
	   Suha al-Massari was detained in the Red Sea port city of Jiddah
upon arrival from London on Nov. 30.
	   She was taken on the same day to Al-Hayer prison in Riyadh, the
human rights group had said earlier.
	   A Saudi official said authorities had detained Suha al-Massari
to question her about her brother's activities in London. The
official, who spoke on customary condition of anonymity, did not
give any other details.
	   Mohammad Al-Massari heads the Committee for the Defense of
Legitimate Rights. The opposition group seeks far-reaching reforms
in conservative Saudi Arabia and sharply criticizes what it views
as widespread corruption and mismanagement by members of the ruling
Al Saud family.
	   Al-Massari had said his sister was not involved in any political
activity and was in London for the past 18 months caring for his
children.
	   She had decided to return to Saudi Arabia to be with her family
during the holy month of Ramadan, which starts around Dec. 20.
	   The center had sent a letter to Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince
Abdullah saying that Suha al-Massari's arrest without charge
violated Islamic principles and urged him to intervene on her
behalf.

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ In a rowdy parliamentary session,
lawmakers on Wednesday called for the dismissal of a public
official who threatened a state governor who recommended her
dismissal.
	   Governing party lawmakers in the Lok Sabha, or lower house of
Parliament, asked the federal government to dismiss the Bihar state
Chief Minister Rabri Devi after she told a public meeting that
people would attack the state governor if he continued to criticize
her.
	   Bihar is considered as India's most lawless state and Governor
Sunder Singh Bhandari _ an appointee of the federal government _
some months ago recommended that Devi's government be fired for its
failure to deal with deteriorating law and order.
	   The recommendation, though accepted by the federal government,
was rejected by President K.R. Narayanan and Devi survived.
	   At a public meeting in Bihar's capital, Patna, on Tuesday night,
Devi warned the governor, who is handicapped, that the people would
break his other leg and send him back to New Delhi.
	   ``Is this the kind of democracy we are nourishing in our
country?'' asked Rita Verma, a lawmaker with the governing
Bharatiya Janata Party.
	   Supporters of Devi sprang to their feet in defense of the state
administration.
	   House speaker N.C. Balayogi refused to allow a discussion on the
subject, but both lawmakers kept up a chorus of chants for more
than 15 minutes.

South Korea moves into quarterfinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be updated with later games &QL; 
 &UR; By PATRICK MCDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ South Korea clinched a quarterfinal
berth in the Asian Games with a tight 2-1 victory over United Arab
Emirates on Wednesday, although star striker Choi Yong-soo was held
scoreless.
	   With two victories in Group 2, South Korea is already in the
final eight. The UAE is winless in two matches in the second round.
	   In the day's second match of the group, Japan, South Korea's
co-host for the 2002 World Cup, was under intense pressure not to
lose to Kuwait, a favorite to win the Asian Games gold. Japan lost
to South Korea on Monday.
	   A second defeat would finish Japan's chances of advancing to the
quarterfinals.
	   But the young Japanese side brought to Bangkok by French coach
Philippe Troussier to prepare for the 2000 Olympics was bound to
have its hands full with the top two scorers of the games _ Jasem
Al-Huwaidi with eight and Farj Haleeb with seven.
	   In a Group 1 match, Turkmenistan and North Korea battled to a
1-1 draw. Turkmenistan has a victory and a draw. North Korea is
hanging on with a loss and a draw.
	   South Korea found a tougher opponent than it expected in the
United Arab Emirates. Both sides played tight defense, with the
Koreans looking to clinch a quarterfinal berth and the UAE
struggling to survive after a 5-0 loss in the group opener Monday
to Kuwait.
	   Korean attacker Choi, trailing the Kuwaiti duo in the games
goals chart with six, was held to a pair of hopeless long shots.
	   But sustained pressure on the UAE opened up a quick drive in the
38th minute. Park Jin-sup's feints allowed a deep penetration
before he lofted a long pass back to midfield.
	   Yoon Jong-hwan met it and his shot from 25 meters blew past
Emirates keeper Rashed Yousif Humadi, who barely had time to move.
The goal was Yoon's second of the games.
	   Sultanrashed Kalbani tried to equalize a minute later but Korean
Kim Byung-ji stretched a couple of fingers on the ball to push it
to the near post and away.
	   A dangerous tackle by Ali Saleed Rashid eight minutes into the
second half gave South Korea a chance to add insurance. Midfielder
Yoo Sang-chul scored from the penalty spot, making it 2-0.
	   The Emirates quickly replied. A controlled pitch-hugging pass by
Kazim Ali Abdulla set up teammate Mohammed Ibrahim Alboloshi, whose
goal made it 2-1.
	   South Korean coach Hun Jung-moo said he will field his second
string against Kuwait.
	   ``Already we have entered the quarterfinals so we will let the
others who haven't played in the next game. I don't care about the
next match,'' he said.
	   He was a bit concerned about the scoreless Choi.
	   ``I hope he will score in the next game he plays,'' Hun said.
	   The Turkmenistan-North Korea encounter was scoreless for the
first half.
	   Ri Chang Gyu opened the scoring in the 70th minute.
Turkmenistan's Roman Bondarenko evened it with a minute left in
regulation time.

Report: Japan to announce dlrs 8.5 billion in aid for Asia at
</HEADLINE>
regional conference

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan will announce a 1 trillion yen (dlrs 8.5
billion) package of loans for ailing Asian countries at next week's
meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a major
Japanese newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The low-interest loans would be given only to Japanese companies
doing business in the region, the Yomiuri Shimbun reported in its
evening edition. The program will be limited to Japanese companies
so that the loans both support crisis-stricken Asian countries and
boost Japan's own economy, the paper said.
	   The aid program would be separate from the so-called Miyazawa
plan, a dlrs 30 billion assistance fund to Asian economies that was
unveiled in October, the report said. But it was not clear if the
lending would be separate from the dlrs 10 billion support package
for Asia that Japan and the United States announced at a regional
economic summit last month.
	   An official from Japan's Foreign Ministry said Japan had not yet
reached a final decision on the plan and refused to comment
further.
	   Japan will begin making the loans next year and continue for
three to five years, the report said. The loans would be used
mainly to build roads and bridges and for other public
infrastructure projects in countries such as Thailand and
Indonesia, the paper said.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi will unveil the plan at a meeting of
the nine members of ASEAN in Hanoi on Dec. 15-16, the paper said.
	   ASEAN comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Swiss lawmakers elect country's first female president
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RAISES reference to Dreifuss being first Jewish president. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss politicians on Wednesday elected
Interior Minister Ruth Dreifuss as the country's president for
1999, making her the first woman and first Jew ever to lead the
Swiss government.
	   Dreifuss, 58, of the left-of-center Social Democrats, replaces
Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti in the largely ceremonial post, which
rotates on an annual basis between the seven members of the
coalition cabinet.
	   An assembly of the two houses of parliament approved Dreifuss'
appointment in a secret ballot by 158 votes out of a possible 210.
	   Defense Minister Adolf Ogi will be her deputy, putting him line
to assume the presidency in 2000.
	   Dreifuss in 1993 became only the second woman to be elected to
the Federal Council, or cabinet, and is its only female member.
	   Dreifuss' selection, set a year ago when she was made deputy,
was not related to her religion. She has kept a low profile during
the recent controversy over Swiss banks' role in hiding wealth
looted by the Nazis during World War II.
	   Dreifuss, an economist and expert on social security, is in
control of health and social issues. She has overseen Switzerland's
drug policy, introducing measures to give heroin to long-term
addicts.

Sonic booms from Israeli jets frighten some Beirut residents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes broke the sound barrier
over Beirut Wednesday, causing two loud booms that sent panicky
residents scurrying for cover.
	   The low flights over the capital came hours after other Israeli
jets and helicopters conducted mock bombing runs over southern
Lebanon, drawing anti-aircraft fire.
	   Two Israeli planes flew low over Beirut at 9:10 a.m. (0710 GMT)
at speeds of more than 1,200 kilometers per hour (750 miles per
hour), bringing rush-hour traffic to a momentary standstill in some
places.
	   The supersonic booms rattled windows of apartment buildings.
Some people said they were knocked off their chairs. Others jumped
from their beds thinking that bombs were falling.
	   A resident of the crowded Mar Elias neighborhood of Beirut said
one school began to send its pupils to basements.
	   News agencies received many calls from citizens reporting that
the planes had dropped bombs, but the authorities denied this.
	   Anti-aircraft guns fired at the Israeli jets from Naameh, a
coastal village 16 kilometers (10 miles) south of Beirut, security
officials said. It was not known immediately who fired at the
aircraft, but Palestinian guerrillas have bases in the area.
	   The planes roared over the city about two hours later, but broke
no sound barriers.
	   Israeli jets frequently make high-altitude flights and break the
sound barrier over Beirut. But Wednesday's flights were the lowest
in years and reminded people of the Israeli invasion of 1982 when
the city came under severe bombardment.
	   The flights were seen as a warning to Lebanon about the
guerrilla attacks on Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon.
Guerrillas killed seven Israeli troops in the Israeli-occupied zone
last month.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Israeli warplanes made repeated mock bombing
runs over southern Lebanon, said security officials who spoke on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   The jets dropped flares over villages along the edge of the
Israeli-occupied zone. Lebanese army anti-aircraft guns and
guerrillas fired on the planes.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah and other guerrilla groups are
fighting to oust 1,500 Israeli troops and 2,500 allied militiamen
from the occupied zone. Israel set up the zone in 1985 as a buffer
against guerrilla attacks on its northern territory.

Asian chief says Paris does not deserve 2008 Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Asia's chief Olympic official says
Paris does not deserve the 2008 Olympics because it would mean
consecutive Summer Games in Europe.
	   Olympic Council of Asia president Sheikh Ahmad Al-Sabah told The
Associated Press that he expected an Asian bid would win host
rights for the 2008 Games because Athens is host for the 2004
edition.
	   ``I think 2008 is a time when the Olympics should return to
Asia, especially with the success of Seoul in 1988 and Nagano,''
Sheikh Ahmad said. ``There is a tradition in the Olympic family
that when you have the games in Europe, the next games will be out
of Europe. The next one (after Sydney) will be in Athens so then it
will be the turn of the other continents to host the games.''
	   International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch
earlier this week told a news conference, attended by Sheikh Ahmad,
that there were no set rules under the IOC charter preventing two
consecutive Summer Games in Europe.
	   Paris declared its plan to bid this week despite earlier reports
that France would not bid if China was interested.
	   Chinese officials say they are considering a bid, likely for
Beijing but other cities have been touted.
	   ``We will always support an Asian bidder of course,'' Sheikh
Ahmad said. ``China with a big bid, Osaka as one of the big markets
and Kuala Lumpur after the success of the Commonwealth Games should
all dream of the Olympic Games.''
	   While there are no rules against back-to-back European Olympics,
it would go against recent history. Since the Olympics were held in
Helsinki in 1952, they have not returned to the same continent for
the next edition.
	   ``The experience of the IOC is that only in the beginning of the
modern Olympics were they held twice on the same continent,''
Sheikh Ahmad said. ``You have to read the history to tell the
future and this is what we are depending on and we are depending on
Asia to have a very good city to bid.''

Clashes, strike over prisoners on 11th anniversary of uprising
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Despite U.S. calls to stop violence, hundreds
of Palestinians marking the 11th anniversary of their uprising
against Israel stoned Israeli troops and motorists throughout the
West Bank on Wednesday.
	   Soldiers fired rubber bullets and tear gas, and at least three
Palestinians and one Israeli were hurt.
	   Palestinians in the West Bank and traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem also observed a commercial strike to press for the
release of Palestinians jailed for anti-Israeli activities, a key
point of contention between Israel and the Palestinians.
	   The violence came just four days before the start of U.S.
President Bill Clinton's visit to Israel and the Palestinian areas.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright demanded that Israel
and the Palestinians stick to the terms of the Wye River peace
agreement Clinton helped negotiate.
	   ``I have been in touch with both sides in the last few days,
making clear that it's important for the Palestinians to live up to
their obligations in terms of taking care of the security situation
and following through on what they are obligated to do, and also,
with the Israelis, not to add conditions,'' Albright said.
	   Last week, Israel suspended its next troop withdrawal in the
West Bank, citing Palestinian violations of the accord, including
alleged incitement against Israel over the prisoner issue.
	   The Palestinians said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held up
the agreement because he wanted to appease hard-line legislators
and prevent the fall of his crumbling coalition.
	   Arafat delivered a tough speech Wednesday to loyalists from his
Fatah faction in the West Bank town of Hebron, saying he would not
compromise on the prisoners. Arafat has come under growing domestic
criticism for his failure to win the release of large numbers of
so-called security prisoners during the Wye negotiations.
	   ``We tell our heroes, the prisoners, that we will not close our
eyes until we see them in front of us,'' Arafat told the crowd.
	   Under the accord, Israel is to release 750 prisoners by the end
of January. It freed 250 in a first stage last month, but most of
them were common criminals. Arafat said he had been made to believe
that all those freed were to be security prisoners.
	   Arafat also said Wednesday that he has turned down U.S. demands
that he stop talking in public about unilaterally declaring a
Palestinian state in May, at the end of the five-year autonomy
period. Arafat met Tuesday evening with U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis
Ross for nearly four hours, and was to hold more talks Wednesday.
	   ``In the last meeting with the Americans yesterday, they told me
not to use ... the word state,'' Arafat said. ``I told them we have
said it already and that's it.''
	   Earlier Tuesday, Ross met with Netanyahu who delivered a list of
complaints about what he said were alleged Palestinian violations,
	   Netanyahu also said that under such circumstances, he could not
hand over more land. ``While they (the Palestinians) are busy
demolishing each and every clause in the Wye agreement, who could
expect me to transfer more territory,'' the Yediot Ahronot daily
quoted Netanyahu as telling Ross.
	   Five percent of the West Bank are to be transferred from sole
Israeli control to joint jurisdiction immediately after the
Palestine National Council, the Palestinians' parliament-in-exile,
on Monday reaffirms a decision by lesser bodies to revoke PLO
charter clauses calling for Israel's destruction.
	   Netanyahu has insisted that the PNC take a vote by a show of
hand, while the Palestinians say a vote is not required under the
agreement. Netanyahu complained to Ross that the invitation for the
PNC meeting only said delegates were to listen to a Clinton speech.
	   ``This is not serious,'' Yediot quoted him as telling Clinton.
	   The Clinton trip was intended to shore up the Wye agreement, but
appeared to be achieving the opposite.
	   Israel fears that Clinton's visit to Gaza will give presidential
approval on the Palestinians' claims to independence. Yediot said
it polled Cabinet ministers and learned that nine out of 17 had
reservations about the Clinton visit.
	   The Palestinians, meanwhile, have stepped up their protests,
apparently in hopes of drawing the president's attention to the
fate of the prisoners.
	   On Wednesday, the 11th anniversary of the start of the six-year
Palestinian uprising, or intefadeh, hundreds of Palestinians at
nearly a dozen locations in the West Bank burned tires, overturned
garbage dumpers and threw stones at Israeli troops and drivers.
	   At least three Palestinians were injured by rubber bullets, and
one Israeli truck driver was struck by a stone.

Greek central bank cuts interest rates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece's central bank reduced interest
rates Wednesday in a move likely to be followed by the nation's
commercial banks.
	   The Bank of Greece reduced its rate on 14-day deposits to 12.25
percent from 12.75 percent, a statement said.
	   It also plans to cut its key Lombard interest rate to 15.50
percent from 16 percent beginning Thursday. The rates, however,
remain significantly higher than in most other European Union
nations.
	   Analysts predict private banks also to drop interest rates.
	   The bank partly attributed the rate cut to declining inflation
in Greece, where the government is struggling to meet EU fiscal
guidelines to take part in the single currency group by 2001.
	   Greek officials predict inflation should fall below 4 percent by
the end of the year. The EU-mandated target is 2 percent.

Centennial of America's 'Splendid Little War' gets scant attention
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish-American War Centennial year is
slipping by with little fanfare despite its historical significance
for the United States, Spain and the islands they fought over.
	   The Treaty of Paris that ended the conflict was signed on Dec.
10, 1898, 100 years ago Thursday.
	   Under the treaty Spain handed over Cuba, Puerto Rico and the
Philippines, the last vestiges of its already crumbling empire. For
the United States, victory demonstrated to the world its potential
as a global power.
	   ``There are black years, and 1898 was as black as the ink that
signed the surrender treaties,'' the newspaper Heraldo de Aragon
lamented in its New Year's edition a few weeks after the signing.
	   Spain's wounded pride has now healed, and a handful of
anniversary year commemorations, mostly art exhibitions and
academic seminars, looked on the bright side: a cultural flowering
inspired by the end of the empire.
	   The group of writers, philosophers, scientists and artists known
as the Generation of 98 created one of the most dynamic periods in
Spanish culture.
	   ``Defeat forged the image of a dead and powerless nation and
encouraged a profound pessimism, but there was also a sense of
relief from the impossible task of keeping the empire,'' Spanish
historian Santos Julia said in an interview.
	   Although he views the collapse of a 400-year-old empire as key
to modern Spanish history, Sebastian Balfour from the London School
of Economics believes the trauma has now been overcome.
	   ``The symbol of 1898 and the bitterness it caused were buried
under the wave of modernization that swept Spain in the 60s and
70s,'' he said in a telephone interview.
	   Newly confident and bolstered by major international companies
in telecommunications, energy, tourism and banking, Spain has today
embarked on a commercial ``reconquest'' by investing heavily in its
former colonies.
	   Meanwhile, in the U.S. commemorations of 1898 have focused on
the sinking of the USS Maine in Havana harbor on Feb. 15, killing
267 officers and sailors.
	   A commemorative stamp was issued, and memorial services and
exhibitions held around the U.S. and even in Cuba paying tribute to
the battleship enshrined in the American collective consciousness
by the battle cry ``Remember the Maine!''.
	   Although the cause of the ship's destruction has always been
disputed, 100 years ago the war-thirsty ``yellow press'' insisted
on blaming the ``perfidious Spanish,'' and so increased the
pressure on the U.S. government to go to war.
	   But beyond the Maine, the centennial of what President Teddy
Roosevelt called ``a splendid little war'' has gone virtually
unnoticed by Americans.
	   ``One of the conflicts with the greatest implications for
Americans even today has all but faded from the modern American
mind,'' wrote historian Patrick McSherry on the half finished
Spanish-American War Centennial website.
	   The war lasted less than four months, from April 25 to Aug. 12.
Only 332 Americans died in battle, although another 2,957 died from
diseases. The Spaniards lost 65,000 soldiers and sailors, 60,000 of
them to disease. The big killer was yellow fever.
	   The Americans fought in the name of freeing the Spanish
Caribbean and Pacific from the shackles of arcane Spanish
colonialism. Their troops were somewhat welcomed by independence
forces in all three colonies.
	   But Joseph Smith, who teaches U.S. history at Exeter University,
says the war ``soon became a bit embarrassing,'' because of the
ambiguous U.S. attitude toward colonialism, an uprising and
subsequent war in the Philippines and ongoing, delicate relations
with Cuba.
	   Spain and the United States are both happy to keep the forgotten
war forgotten and enjoy excellent bilateral relations.
	   ``The disaster freed the Spaniards of the need to go on hating
the Americans,'' Julia said, insisting that relations normalized
immediately after the Treaty of Paris.
	   For the Philippines, there was little to celebrate until 1946,
when the United States finally granted independence. Its first
declaration of independence was celebrated this year, not the war
that brought the Americans.
	   Puerto Rico observed the 100th anniversary of the U.S. invasion
with an official ceremony. But attention was focused more this year
on the war's legacy: the never-ending ``status debate'' as
preparations moved forward for a plebiscite on three choices:
continued commonwealth, statehood or independence.
	   Cuba, as it has for years, commemorated the deaths of its
independence heroes and ignored the U.S. role in getting rid of the
Spaniards.
	   One hundred years after the U.S. navy quashed the Spanish armada
in the name of Cuban independence, a visit to the Caribbean island
by a U.S. president is unthinkable.
	   Spain, on the other hand, will send King Juan Carlos on his
first visit to Cuba in the spring to show just how good relations
are between the former imperial power and the colony it signed away
to the United States.

Romanian prime minister seeks union support for reforms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIHAELA ARMASELU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Prime Minister Radu Vasile is asking
the country's main trade unions for support while he carries out
tough economic reforms, a government spokeswoman said Wednesday.
	   Vasile met the leaders of several trade unions late Tuesday and
will meet others Wednesday, asking them to hold off on organizing
street protests for six months while reforms are implemented, said
Elena Marinescu, spokeswoman for the Ministry of Industry and
Trade.
	   Reactions to the request were mixed. ``If the government really
wants to make reforms, we are ready to support them,'' Marin
Condescu, leader of the Miners Unions Confederation, said by
telephone. ``But I have the feeling that these are only
gift-wrapped promises.''
	   In recent weeks, tens of thousands of workers have taken to the
streets to vent their anger with the government.
	   Workers and union leaders say the government lacks a workable
strategy to privatize state-owned firms. They also claim high taxes
are causing widespread poverty.
	   Condescu, who represents more than 90,000 miners, said
government policies had prevented several state companies from
paying salaries for several months.
	   Some companies have not paid their electricity bills, making it
impossible for electricity company, Conel, to pay mines that supply
coal. The mines, in turn, have not paid their workers.
	   Vasile recently said the government intends to close several
state-owned enterprises by Dec. 20, cutting losses to the Romanian
economy by 15 percent. He did not specify which firms could be
closed, but the Ministry of Industry and Trade recently published a
list of the top money losers, including the refinery Petromidia
Navodari and soda maker Solventul Timisoara.
	   Other state companies are expected to be closed in the first
half of 1999. Tens of thousands of jobs could be axed.
	   The premier told union officials only companies that were unable
to pay their debts for several months would be closed. The
government said it is owed dlrs 870 million by loss-making
companies.
	   ``It is not a time for tepid solutions. ... We have to act,''
Marinescu quoted Industry and Trade Minister Radu Berceanu as
saying.
	   On Wednesday, some 9,000 angry steel workers in the eastern city
of Galati protested because they hadn't been paid for three months.
	   ``It's rather hard to convince (people) to stay indoors when
their children are crying from hunger,'' Condescu said. The average
monthly salary is 1.2 million lei (dlrs 120).
	   The government's proposal comes at a difficult moment. Hard
currency reserves dropped below dlrs 2 billion for the first time
this year. Economic analysts have warned that Romania will be
unable to pay its foreign debts of dlrs 2.2 billion next year.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A chartered Egyptian airliner carrying about
150 people was hijacked Wednesday after taking off from Tunis,
Tunisia, and ordered to fly to neighboring Libya, but police said
it landed on the Tunisian island of Jerba.
	   The hijackers were no longer inside the plane and were refusing
to speak to authorities, an Egyptian police official said on
condition of anonymity.
	   It was not clear why the plane landed in Jerba, an island 200
miles (320 kms) south of Tunisia's capital, Tunis.
	   Police said the plane was chartered by a Lebanese company from
EgyptAir, the Egyptian national carrier. The name of the Lebanese
company was not known.
	   The hijackers demanded to go to Libya, the police official said.
He said the craft's pilot had reported the incident to Egyptian
officials.
	   Passengers aboard the plane included Libyans.
	   No further details were immediately available.

Satellite and cable TV operators see rosy future in Asia after
</HEADLINE>
crisis
 &UR; By JONATHAN DRAKE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Despite slower growth since the economic crisis
struck Asia, cable and satellite television operators meeting in
Singapore Wednesday predicted a generally rosy future for the
industry in the region.
	   ``We all agree its been a very tough year in Asia for all
industries, cable and satellite TV included,'' Frank Brown,
president of MTV Asia, told The Associated Press during a
conference of regional broadcasters.
	   But these TV operators will benefit from recent cost-cutting and
efficiency-boosting measures, he argued, and quick growth will
return when the region lifts itself out of the slowdown.
	   ``I think we're over the worst of it already,'' said Brown. ``I
think by the second half of 1999 we'll start to see recovery and
return to growth for individual economies of Asia and also for the
cable and satellite industry regionally.''
	   Last year, an estimated one in five Asian households already
subscribed to a cable and satellite service, and the numbers will
continue to rise, said Singapore's Information and Arts Minister
George Yeo during a speech opening the three-day conference.
	   ``Once the region recovers, which it would in a few years, the
broadcast industry would resume its rapid growth,'' said Yeo.
	   Much of the sector's early growth was due to public enthusiasm
over a wide choice of viewing choices after decades of extremely
limited options, CNBC Asia president Paul France said during a
panel discussion.
	   CNBC Asia is a regional television news broadcaster owned by
U.S. companies.
	   Although optimistic about the industry's potential in Asia,
France warned that viewers now are more discerning, so satellite
and cable TV operators must customize and market their product more
effectively to return to previously robust levels of growth.
	   He noted that several pay-TV markets in Asia have not yet
progressed past the simple provision of choice.
	   While most Asian operators have been hurt by the crisis, some
have managed to buck the trend of slower growth. MTV Asia, based in
Singapore, has seen its distribution skyrocket since the regional
economic slump started: from 57 million homes last year to 96
million homes.
	   MTV's Brown attributed this surprising performance to their
aggressive marketing, careful attention to customizing their
broadcast for particular countries and a young target audience that
has not suffered from the downturn as much as other segments of the
regional population.
	   But most cable and satellite services in Asia are especially
eager for an end to the regional downturn, when advertising
revenues are expected to pick up again.
	   ``I do believe though that if things do not improve as soon as
the second half of '99, then the industry is in a good position to
just hunker down and go for steady growth,'' added Brown.

North Korea investigated at Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Controversy erupted Wednesday at the
Asian Games gymnastics competition after officials decided to
investigate North Korea's team of diminutive women athletes to see
if they were underage.
	   Officials said they wanted to check the North Koreans' passports
to see if they had all reached the minimum age of 16. Coaches from
rival teams, as well as doctors and officials, questioned the
girls' ages after seeing them in competition Tuesday.
	   ``We are going to investigate,'' said Wei Jizhong, chairman of
the Olympic Committee of Asia's standing committee. ``If you want
to check, you have to check their passports, there's no other
way.''
	   Organizers decided to examine the North Koreans' passports after
an official from the Asian Gymnastics Union queried the age of
their women.
	   ``She said I think we better check because their faces look very
young. They don't look 16,'' said Suebsai Boonveerabut, the
competition organizer.
	   But the meeting with the North Koreans shortly after the men's
all-around competition proved inconclusive because the women's
passports were with another North Korean official who had gone to
the airport to meet someone, she said.
	   The North Koreans were told to produce the passports by
midnight, and the women were allowed to carry on competing, but
their results would be voided if they were later found to be
underage, she said.
	   North Korea had three women competing in Wednesday's competition
to decide the best all-around gymnast.
	   If the passports said that the women turned 16 this year,
officials would have to leave the matter there, said Jackie Fie,
from the sport's governing body, the FIG. ``You can't wage war with
a government,'' she said.
	   Meanwhile, Sheikh Ahmad Al-Sabah, president of the Olympic
Council of Asia, told The Associated Press: ``We are doing our job
(investigating) and we will make a decision.
	   ``I believe it is wrong to bring children to compete in
gymnastics, not only here but everywhere. Otherwise they would
start at 4 or 5 years old and it's too young to take the
responsibility of their countries,'' he added.
	   ``We will always follow the international federation's rules on
this matter and if something is wrong of course we will cooperate
with the federation.''
	   There would be no games-wide sanctions, he said.
	   ``This is only one sport we are dealing with and it would be the
same if there was a doping case. If a person was involved he would
be expelled, not his country.''

	   LAHORE: Pakistan (AP) _ Zimbabwean captain Alistair Campbell
said Wednesday that his team ``will not sit on its laurels,'' but
will work hard to win the second Test against Pakistan in Lahore.
	   The visitors defeated Pakistan by seven wickets in the first
Test in Peshawar. The Lahore Test begins on Thursday.
	   ``We can't sit on 1-0 advantage and expect a draw in the
remaining two matches. We have to win one more Test to clinch the
series. So I think this Test is very crucial for us,'' he said.
``Obviously we want to win every game. It we play good cricket we
can win the series.
	   The Lahore wicket is a seamer-friendly track which is good news
for Zimbabwe, said Campbell.
	   Pakistani batsmen struggled against Zimbabwe seamers in the
first Test.
	   ``Our seamers won the match for us in Peshawar and if the grass
is kept here, I am confident they will bowl well here too,''
Campbell said.
	   Zimbabwe lost a four-dayer against Lahore by one wicket earlier
this week. Salim Malik hammered a strokeful 149.
	   The Pakistan Cricket Board Executive Council kept Aamir Sohail
as captain for the remaining two Test matches against Zimbabwe.
	   ``The pressure is on us, but I am sure the players will try
their best to win the crucial Test,'' Sohail said. ``Nothing is
going right for us. We are dropping too many catches. Bowlers are
not bowling well and the batsmen are struggling.''
	   Sohail said Pakistan needs a winning combination, but he hoped
for a positive results in the next two Tests against Zimbabwe.
	   ``Realistically we have not yet found a true winning combination
and we are trying various combinations which are not going in our
favor,'' he said. ``But I am confident to produce good results in
future.''
	   Former Pakistan Test captain Javed Miandad, who is now coaching
the Pakistan team, chastised his players for ignoring his advice.
	   ``I can't go in the middle and bat. It's the batsman's job to
score runs. Similarly the bowlers are not bowling up to the mark,''
he said.
	   Teams: Pakistan (from): Aamir Sohail (captain), Saeed Anwar,
Ijaz Ahmed, Inzamamul Haq, Yousaf Youhanna, Hasan Raza, Wasim
Akram, Moin Khan, Saqlain Mushtaq, Shoaib Akhtar, Waqar Younis,
Salim Elahi, Mushtaq Ahmed, Muhammad Akram, Azhar Mahmood.

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa's cricket selectors
have included a rare colored player, batsman Herschelle Gibbs, in
their line-up for the second test against the West Indies, which
begins Thursday in Port Elizabeth.
	   The move comes after public criticism by top sports officials of
the all-white composition of the team which beat the West Indies by
four wickets in Johannesburg on Nov. 30.
	   The attacks came from the National Sports Council as well as
Sports Minister Steve Tshwete, who has announced the creation of a
special commission to find ways of integrating mainly white sports
like rugby and cricket.
	   The United Cricket Board of South Africa has pledged to enforce
quota systems at the provincial level from next year, and to
constitute an advisory committee to the national selection panel to
guide it if black or colored players can't be found for the
national side.
	   However, the selection of Gibbs is little more than a
consolation for those who want to see greater opportunity for
blacks or coloreds, as people of mixed race here are called, in
cricket.
	   He already has played seven tests for South Africa, and was
schooled at Cape Town's Diocesan College, one of the most exclusive
schools in the country, and a place renowned for its cricketing
facilities.
	   With South Africa one-nil up in the five-match series, the West
Indies is going to have to make the bolder moves in the second
test.
	   It is now apparent that South Africa's bowling attack is more
penetrating than the much vaunted pace of the West Indies. The
Caribbean team has lost the threat it's pace attacks of old held
for every team it encountered.
	   While Courtney Walsh and Curtly Ambrose are still superb
bowlers, but nearing the ends of distinguished careers. Although
they occasionally produce the unplayably fast delivery, they are
not as consistently in the faces of their opponents as they used to
be.
	   This loss of pace is exacerbated by the fact that they do not
have the support in depth that the West Indies pace attack used to
supply their frontline bowlers.
	   Nixon McLean is the fastest man on view on the two teams but he
was unable to bowl the consistent line needed in test cricket to
penetrate the defences of even average batsmen. So Walsh and
Ambrose are forced to bowl many more overs than should be the case
with bowlers of that pace.
	   South Africa, on the other hand, is blessed with Allan Donald's
genuine pace, and his ability to keep a grip on his direction, or
at least the ability to pull his direction back if he strays.
	   And he is backed by Shaun Pollock, who, in the first test,
appeared to have regained some of the pace he exhibited early in
his career.
	   Young David Terbrugge had a good debut in Johannesburg, and he
seems to be able to generate some considerable pace, as is Jacques
Kallis. So the South Africans seem to be able to press home the
advantage much more effectively than the tourists are when bowling.
Given the truism that you have to bowl a side out twice to win a
test match, this is an obvious advantage.
	   Both teams were brittle in the batting department in the first
test. The West Indies simply appear not to have fired on all
cylinders yet. All their batsmen owe their team a big score, but
perhaps none more so than captain Brian Lara.
	   The left-hander is capable of dominating any attack in the
world, but he has shown only momentary glimpses of the form which
took him to a test record innings of 375. He will need major
contributions from Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Carl Hooper, as well
as a solid opening partnership from Clayton Lambert and Philo
Wallace.
	   South Africa has made the decision to bring Gibbs in for Adam
Bacher as Gary Kisten's opening partner. The young Western Province
player has never opened at this level, and has never been given an
extended run in the test side. It now seems likely that he will be
able to work at cementing his position.
	   If he succeeds early on, South Africa will have the luxury of
using a deep batting line-up more effectively than it has been able
to in the past. All of the top and middle order have shown glimpses
of form, and a good foundation may be all batsmen Darryl Cullinan,
Hansie Cronje, Jonty Rhodes and Pollock need to make big scores.
	   Play on each of the five days of the test is scheduled to begin
at 11 a.m. (0900 gmt) at St. George's Park.
	    &UR; Teams &QC; 
	    &UR; West Indies (possible 12): Brian Lara (captain), Clayton
Lambert, Philo Wallace, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Carl Hooper, Stuart
Williams, Ridley Jacobs (wicketkeeper), Nixon McLean, Curtly
Ambrose, Courtney Walsh, Mervyn Dillon, Rawl Lewis.
	    &UR; South Africa (from): Hansie Cronje (captain), Gary Kirsten,
Herschelle Gibbs, Jacques Kallis, Darryl Cullinan, Jonty Rhodes,
Shaun Pollock, Mark Boucher (wicketkeeper), Pat Symcox, Allan
Donald, Paul Adams, David Terbrugge.

Nobel laureate enters German debate over remembering Holocaust
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Stepping into a bitter German debate
over how to remember the Holocaust, Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel says
dignity demands that the memory of Nazi crimes be protected.
	   In an open letter published Wednesday in the weekly Die Zeit
newspaper, Wiesel called on noted German author Martin Walser to
clarify his controversial remarks about the Holocaust.
	   During a speech accepting a prestigious literary prize in
November, Walser warned against the ``exploitation'' of German
guilt about the Holocaust ``for present purposes,'' and said that
the horror of Auschwitz should not become ``a routine threat.''
	   The leader of Germany's Jewish community, Ignatz Bubis, called
Walser's speech ``spiritual arson'' and accused him of encouraging
neo-Nazi groups.
	   Wiesel echoed Bubis' charge, asking Walser: ``Don't you
understand that you have opened a door that others can push
through, others who follow completely different political views and
are dangerous in a completely different way?''
	   He called on Walser, who wrote the foreword to the German
edition of Wiesel's first book, ``Night,'' to tell his readers
``that protection of the memory (of the Holocaust) belongs to a
dignified life. They deserve to hear it and you deserve to say it
to them.''

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistani cricketer Salim Malik
Wednesday welcomed news that the Australian cricketers, who accused
him of match fixing, have been fined for accepting money from
Indian bookmakers.
	   Australia's Shane Warne and Mark Waugh were secretly fined for
accepting money in 1994 from Indian bookmakers to supply
information on the pitch and weather conditions in Pakistan during
a tour against Sri Lanka and Pakistan, the Australian Cricket Board
said Tuesday.
	   In early 1995 the Australian pair were fined a total of dlrs
11,500 (Australian dollars 18,000) for accepting money from an
illegal Indian bookmaker in exchange for weather and pitch reports.
	   ``I am so happy that I really don't have words to express it,''
said Malik.
	   He promised to sue both Waugh and Warne, accusing the Australian
pair of defaming his character with charges of match fixing.
	   ``I am definitely going to take a legal action against Shane
Warne and Mark Waugh,'' Malik told The Associated Press in the
eastern city of Lahore, where he is preparing for a second Test
against Zimbabwe on Thursday.
	   ``I have suffered so much because of these false charges by
these Australian cricketers,'' said Malik. ``They have really upset
me and have spoiled my cricket for the last two years.''
	   A judicial inquiry is currently being held in Pakistan into
match-fixing charges against former captain Wasim Akram as well as
Malik. Both men have denied the charges. Akram wasn't immediately
available for comment on the charges against Warne and Waugh.
	   Australia's Tim May, along with Waugh and Warne, said Malik
offered them thousands of dollars to throw a match in 1994 which
they turned down.
	   ``They were taking money from the bookmakers . . . I am innocent
and they are the liars,'' said Malik. ``I will definitely sue them
in court.''

Boycott of Italian goods leaves Turkish Fiat sales struggling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Italian companies have lost an estimated
dlrs 200 million since Turkish consumers began boycotting their
goods last month to protest Italy's refusal to extradite a Kurdish
rebel leader, a trade official said Wednesday.
	   Among those hard-hit by the boycott is the Italian automaker
Fiat, whose Turkish partner Roc Holding may begin laying off
workers.
	   Fiat sales have fallen ``as if cut with a blade'' since the
boycott began Nov. 12, Rahmi Roc, the head of Roc Holding, was
quoted as saying Wednesday in the daily Hurriyet. Roc said he might
have to start laying off workers.
	   The commercial attache for the Italian Embassy, Paulo Trichilo,
said Italian firms estimate their overall losses so far at around
dlrs 200 million.
	   ``This is not yet a final figure. It represents the various
orders of Italian imports that have been blocked or postponed by
Turkish companies,'' he said.
	   The Turkish government insists the boycott is a spontaneous
popular expression of public outrage at Italy's failure to
extradite Abdullah Ocalan, who heads the Kurdistan Workers Party,
or PKK.
	   The PKK has been fighting for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern
Turkey since 1984 in a conflict that has claimed 37,000 lives.
	   Italy is one of Turkey's leading trade partners, with total
trade between the two countries at dlrs 5.7 billion in 1997.
Trichilo said about 150 Italian firms have been affected by the
boycott.
	   ``We win and we lose together,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, if
this continues even Turkish workers will be affected.''

Soldier whose beating shocked country to be court-martialed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The army decided Wednesday to court martial an
Israeli soldier whose beating by a Palestinian mob, captured by TV
cameras, shocked the country and froze the peace process.
	   Cpl. Assad Meyara, 19, will be charged with not carrying a
loaded weapon and leaving his base without permission.
	   However, the army will not bring charges against the young
soldier for not firing his M-16 rifle on his attackers who smashed
the windows of the car he was traveling in, dragged him out and
struck him repeatedly in the head with chunks of concrete.
	   The attack took place last week in the West Bank town of
Ramallah. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
suspended the Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   The army spokesman's office said in a statement that a soldier
should have opened fire under such circumstances. Meyara told
investigators that he was unable to act because he was
incapacitated by one of the first rocks striking his head.
	   The attackers also stole Meyara's rifle as he ran to safety. The
pictures of Meyara cowering on the floor and not trying fight back
touched off a debate over whether Israel had lost its nerve.
	   The army also said it will discipline Meyara's commanding
officer for not having giving the corporal proper instructions or
adequate shooting practice.
	   The army is also taking disciplinary action against two officers
who drove by the crowd of stone throwers just minutes before the
attack on Meyara. The officers whose jeep was hit by stones did not
stop or report the incident.

Defense minister orders reinvestigation of officer's death at
</HEADLINE>
Korean border

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The Defense Ministry ordered a new
probe Wednesday into the death of a South Korean army officer
earlier this year to determine if he was killed by a subordinate to
cover up illegal contacts with North Koreans.
	   The order came amid legislative allegations that the officer,
initially thought to have committed suicide, might have been slain
by an enlisted man under his command.
	   First Lt. Kim Hoon, 26, was found shot in the head in a bunker
inside the border village of Panmunjom on Feb. 24. The initial
investigation concluded that he shot himself with a pistol.
	   But a parliamentary probe of the case last week brought
allegations that an army enlisted man might have killed Kim to hide
his illegal contacts with North Korean officers at the heavily
guarded village, known as a joint security area.
	   Staff Sgt. Kim Young-hoon, 28, was arrested Tuesday on charges
of making unauthorized contacts with North Korean officers at the
village in 1997.
	   The soldier allegedly crossed the border at night more than 30
times and received cigarettes, drinks and other gifts from North
Korean officers assigned to lure South Korean soldiers over to
their side, ministry officials said.
	   At least two other South Korean soldiers were also under
investigation on similar charges, they said.
	   The American-led U.N. Command, which controls half of Panmunjom,
said it was cooperating with the investigation.
	   Under the U.N. flag, a battalion of American and South Korean
soldiers guard the southern half of Panmunjom, a 400 meter (yard)-
wide area which serves as the sole contact point in the
demilitarized zone, or DMZ, separating the two Koreas.
	   South Korean officials began the investigation after they were
tipped off by a North Korean border guard who defected to the South
in February, the ministry said.
	   The defector, Byon Yong-kwan, 26, reportedly told investigators
that North Korean security agents had established contact with as
many as 42 South Korean soldiers at the border village in 1997
alone.
	   He also reportedly told investigators that some South Korean
soldiers had promised to spy for North Korea after getting
expensive gifts from communist agents, including a dlrs 4,000 Rolex
wristwatch.
	   Opposition legislators investigating the case alleged that the
dead officer got into a tense confrontation with some of his
subordinates when he tried to discipline them for making

Northern Ireland laureates arrive in Oslo for Nobel Peace Prize

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Roman Catholic John Hume and Protestant
David Trimble arrived Wednesday for celebrations leading up to the
Nobel Peace Prize they will accept in the shadow of discord over
their accord aimed at ending Northern Ireland's sectarian strife.
	   Hume, 61, is a single-minded peacemaker who leads the Northern
Ireland's major Catholic party. Trimble, 54, is chief of the
Protestant party and was a key player in peace efforts.
	   The Norwegian Nobel Committee picked the two as the driving
forces behind a peace accord reached in Belfast, Northern Ireland,
in April. However, in the less than two months since the committee
announced its decision, the accord has run into trouble over
disarmament.
	   Hume and Trimble arrived together at the snowy Gardermoen
airport, north of Oslo, on a private jet that brought them from
Washington D.C. They were immediately whisked away by a waiting
column of vehicles.
	   They are to accept their Nobel prize at a gala ceremony in
Oslo's city hall on Thursday, followed by a traditional torch light
parade and a banquet in their honor. On Friday, events celebrating
their prize include the Nobel Peace Concert.
	   In its awards citation, the Nobel committee called Hume ``the
clearest and most consistent of Northern Ireland's political
leaders in his work for a peaceful solution.''
	   ``As the leader of the traditionally predominant party in
Northern Ireland, David Trimble showed great political courage
when, at a critical stage in the process, he advocated solutions
which led to the peace agreement,'' the citation said.
	   The latest dispute in the decades-long Northern Ireland conflict
came last week when Trimble's Ulster Unionist Party repeated its
demand that the outlawed Irish Republican Army begin to disarm
before its political wing Sinn Fein is allowed to join a new
governing body for Northern Ireland.
	   The April peace agreement envisioned Protestant and Catholic
politicians forming a multiparty administration for Northern
Ireland and joint policy-making bodies with the Irish Republic by
October. Neither of those steps have been taken.
	   In Washington last week, Trimble warned that failure of militant
nationalists to surrender their weapons ``is tending to poison the
atmosphere.'' But Trimble, a member of the British Parliament, also
said that glitches in carrying out the peace accord should not be
seen as signs that it is collapsing.
	   In Northern Ireland, police this week said IRA leaders had met
secretly on a possible policy statement. Many hope they will
announce a breakthrough in disarmament.
	   Hume trained for the priesthood before becoming a well-know
peace activist and leading Catholic civil rights protests while
condemning IRA violence.
	   Trimble was a Belfast university law lecturer who opposed
efforts to share power with Catholics because he feared it would
jeopardize Northern Ireland's union with Britain. Joining peace
talks was a major change in his stance.
	   The laureates were just two of many involved in the Northern
Ireland Peace process, including Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams.
	   The Nobel Prizes, which include a 7.6 million Swedish kronor
(dlrs 950,000) award, are always presented on the Dec. 10
anniversary of the death of their benefactor, Alfred Nobel, a Swede
who invented dynamite. The peace prize is awarded in Oslo and the
other prizes in Stockholm, Sweden.

About 200 inspectors seeking banned weapons in Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.N. spokeswoman saying inspections are routine,
to end Monday.
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Nearly 200 U.N. arms inspectors searched
for banned weapons in Iraq Wednesday as Iraqi newspapers renewed
complaints that the inspections were not leading to a lifting of
U.N. sanctions.
	   Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for the U.N. Special Commission in
charge of the arms inspections, said all the U.N. arms experts in
the country were working Wednesday.
	   When asked if they would be carrying out surprise visits, which
have angered Iraq before, she said only the ``inspectors will carry
on a full range of activities in Iraq.''
	   Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler had said earlier in
New York that a series of surprise visits would begin Tuesday. Past
visits have included such sensitive sites as offices of Iraq's
ruling Baath Party.
	   On Tuesday, nine arms monitoring groups, two biological warfare
teams and a missile unit conducted 32 searches, some using
helicopters, the Iraqi News Agency said.
	   But UNSCOM spokeswoman Cross that the inspectors' latest work _
which would wrap up on Monday _ was no different than past
inspections.
	   ``There is nothing much particularly new or innovative about the
work they are doing now,'' she said later outside U.N. headquarters
in Baghdad.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A chartered Egyptian airliner was hijacked
Wednesday after taking off from Tunis, Tunisia, and ordered to fly
to neighboring Libya, an airport official said. But police said the
craft landed in Jerba, Tunisia.
	   The passengers on the plane included Libyans and apparently a
large number demanded to go to Libya, a police official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity. He said the craft's pilot had
reported the incident to Egyptian officials.
	   The hijackers left the craft but aboard were refusing to speak
to authorities, the police official said. It was not clear why the
craft landed in Jerba, an island 350 kilometers (210 miles) south
of the capital Tunis.
	   According to police, the craft was chartered by a Lebanese
company from EgyptAir, the Egyptian national carrier. The name of
the Lebanese company was not immediately known.

American expatriate shot, wounded by car thieves in Yemen

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Gunmen have shot and wounded an American
working in Yemen while trying to hijack his car, a security
official said Wednesday.
	   Richard Boney, a development worker, was attacked by three
assailants Tuesday night as he parked in front of his home in the
southern province of Shabwa, 530 kilometers (329 miles) southeast
of the capital San`a, the official said.
	   One of the men got into the passenger seat and attempted to
steal the car keys. When Boney punched him and pushed him out of
the car, the man's accomplices opened fire.
	   Boney collapsed on to the steering wheel, bleeding heavily, and
the assailants fled, the security official said.
	   Police are searching for the attackers.
	   Boney was working as an administrator on a Dutch agricultural
development program, said the official.
	   The American and Dutch embassies have refused to comment on the
incident.
	   Boney underwent an 80 minute operation on his arm Tuesday
evening and received one and a half liters (3.15 pints) of blood,
said an official at the al-Hikma hospital in Shabwa.
	   Boney was in stable condition Wednesday, but still in the
hospital's intensive care unit, said the official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   Boney drove a four-wheel drive car, a vehicle that is highly
prized in Yemen, one of the poorest nations in the Arab world.

CLARIFIES it's uncertain whether hijackers still on aircraft. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A chartered Egyptian airliner was hijacked
Wednesday and ordered to fly to Libya, police officials said. But
they said the craft landed in Jerba, Tunisia, a frequent transit
point for land travel to Libya.
	   The plane, an MD-9O, was hijacked after it took off from San`a,
the capital of Yemen, en route to the Tunisian capital Tunis.
Apparently none of the passengers or crew was injured.
	   The pilot contacted Egyptian authorities by radio and reported a
large number of Libyan passengers rioted and demanded he fly to the
Libyan capital Tripoli in violation of U.N. sanctions against
international flights to the country, a police official said.
	   About 150 Libyans were aboard the craft, which was chartered by
a private Egyptian company for a flight by Libyan businessmen, a
Cairo airport official said. Police said the craft itself belongs
to EgyptAir, the national carrier.
	   Both the police and airport officials spoke on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Libya has frequently violated the U.N. flight ban, which was
adopted in 1992 to force Libya to turn over two suspects wanted in
the bombing of an Pan Am jet over Scotland in 1988.
	   The police official said the pilot was told by Egyptian
authorities that he could fly to Libya under duress without
violating sanctions, but the pilot apparently tricked the hijackers
and landed in Jerba.
	   The hijackers were refusing to speak to authorities, the police
official said. It was unclear if they were still on the plane. An
official at Jerba airport, who refused to give his name, confirmed
the craft had landed there.
	   Jerba, an island 350 kilometers (210 miles) south of the capital
Tunis, is frequently used as a transit point for travelers going on
to Libya without violating the sanctions.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Despite a lack of fresh buying incentives, most
Asian stock markets closed higher Wednesday.
	   On the Tokyo market, Asia's biggest, prices rose for a third
straight session, even though many investors took to the sidelines
ahead of Friday's settlement of December futures and options, when
prices might swing unpredictably.
	   Participants also turned cautious as they awaited Monday's
release of the Bank of Japan's closely-watched quarterly ``tankan''
business confidence survey.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 123.70 points,
or 0.84 percent, to close at 14,931.90. On Tuesday, the Nikkei had
gained 0.58 percent.
	   Traders said Parliament's swift approval of a 5.7 trillion yen
(dlrs 48 billion) supplementary budget Tuesday evening cushioned
the market's fall earlier in the day.
	   The extra budget will help fund the 24 trillion yen (dlrs 200
billion) economic stimulus package that the government unveiled
last month.
	   In Singapore, prices closed sharply higher as speculation about
more interest rate cuts gained momentum. The Straits Times Index
surged 2.2 percent to end at 1,424.59, above the psychologically
important level of 1,400 points.
	   Traders expect Singapore banks to lower their prime lending
rates _ the fifth time in three months _ by 0.25 percentage points
to 0.5 percent.
	   In South Korea, share prices jumped on hopes of an upgrade in
the country's credit rating, after rating agency Moody's Investors
Services Inc. upgraded the rating of bonds denominated in the local
currency, the won, late last week.
	   The key Kospi index rallied 3.3 percent to 526.52 points.
	   In Taiwan, shares ended lower for the second straight session as
investors sold technology companies after a U.S. regulatory ruling
went against Taiwanese computer chip makers in a dumping case.
	   The Weighted Price Index of the Taiwan Stock Exchange closed
down 1.3 percent to 7,117.81.
	   In Hong Kong, share prices ended almost unchanged in light
volume.
	   The Hang Seng Index added 10.21 points, or 0.1 percent, to close
at 10,361.29. The index had dropped 0.7 percent on Tuesday after a
surge of 4.7 percent Monday on surprise interest rate cuts in Hong
Kong and mainland China.
	   Elsewhere:
	   JAKARTA: Indonesia's key JSX index closed down 0.118 points at
398.783 in thin trading. Dealers said escalating student protests
following the questioning of former President Suharto over charges
of corruption during his 32-year reign added to the negative
sentiment.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: The blue-chip Composite Index jumped 2.2 percent
to 522.18 points, as local investors used a hefty trade surplus as
an excuse to jump back into the market.
	   MANILA: The Philippines' key PSE index shed 2.6 percent to
1,739.34 points. The absence of fresh positive news and a
still-unproven claim by former first lady Imelda Marcos about large

European drug makers Zeneca and Astra confirm merger plans

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The boards of directors of the Swedish
and British pharmaceutical companies Astra and Zeneca confirmed
Wednesday they intend to merge, making a global player out of two
mid-sized companies that would have had to struggle to make it on
their own.
	   The new company, AstraZeneca, would be the third-biggest company
worldwide in its field, with combined 1998 sales of about dlrs 10
billion. It would become Europe's No. 2 drug-maker.
	   ``I'm convinced this is an excellent business transaction,''
Percy Barnevik, the proposed chairman of the company, said at a
news conference. Barnevik currently heads Investor AB, the
investment of arm of Sweden's Wallenberg family, which owns 12
percent of Astra.
	   The proposed chief executive is Zeneca's CEO Tom McKillop.
	   McKillop said final merger documents are expected by the end of
the year and that he hoped for shareholder and regulatory approval
soon afterward.
	   Asked about a possible bid by a rival company, McKillop said,
``There is nothing we can do to prevent any eventual interloper,''
adding ''we are well prepared to fight for this marriage that we
support.''
	   Barnevik said he has explained the proposed merger to Prime
Minister Goeran Persson.
	   Astra and Zeneca, including non-pharmaceutical divisions, had
total 1997 sales of 15.9 billion dollars, with pre-tax profit of
3.5 billion dollars, the companies said. The combined market
capitalization was put at 67 billion dollars.
	   About 6,000 jobs _ 11 percent of the current combined workforce
of 54,000 _ would be lost, mostly from marketing divisions, said
Hakan Mogren, AstraZeneca's proposed deputy chairman.
	   In the face of a wave of mergers in the pharmaceuticals
industry, Mogren said Astra and Zeneca had little choice but to
join forces.
	   ``If we are going to be competitive among world pharmaceutical
companies, we need this merger,'' he said.
	   Restructuring was projected to require three years' time and
about dlrs 1.2 billion, McKillop said, after which annual operating
costs would be lowered by about 1.1 billion dollars.
	   The merger had been rumored for months. Confirmation boosted
Astra's shares by 12 percent, to 169 kronor (dlrs 21), in early
trading Wednesday on Stockholm's bourse.
	   Astra is best known as the maker of Prilosec, an ulcer and
heartburn medication that is the world's best-selling prescription
drug. It comprises about half the company's total sales.
	   But the drug is scheduled to lose its patent protection in 2001,
opening the door for generic firms to make a less expensive copy
and slow the company's overall sales growth. Analysts speculated
that was a leading factor influencing the merger.
	   Astra, established in 1913, also makes lidocaine, a popular
local anaesthesia.
	   Zeneca is the second-leading maker of cancer drugs behind
Bristol-Myers Squibb of the United States. It also has a large
agro-chemical business and owns Salick Health Care, a U.S. operator
of cancer treatment and dialysis centers.
	   Last year, Zeneca introduced its migraine drug Zomig, and
earlier this year received clearance for a breast cancer drug.
	   But like Astra, Zeneca also has several cancer drugs expected to
soon lose their patent protection.
	   Officials from both companies said their product mix, similar
corporate cultures, and research and development focus make the
merger a good fit.
	   ``It's good for our shareholders ... employees ... customers and
patients,'' Mogren said.
	   The companies said shares would be merged on an equal-value
basis.
	   The AstraZeneca corporate headquaters would be in London, the
research and development headquarters in Sweden.
	   Last week, Germany's Hoechst and France's Rhone-Poulenc agreed
to merge their drug and agro-chemical businesses as the first step
toward a total merger.
	   In France, Sanofi and Synthelabo recently announced their dlrs
10 billion merger.

 &UR; Yeltsin leaves hospital, moves to country residence &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin was released from a hospital
Wednesday after more than two weeks of treatment for pneumonia, but
the Russian leader was not expected to return to full-time duty in
the Kremlin anytime soon.
	   Yeltsin moved to a secluded country residence, Rus, about 100
kilometers (60 miles) outside Moscow and planned to remain there
for a ``convalescence period,'' said his spokesman Dmitry
Yakushkin.
	   Yeltsin has rarely been seen or heard since he was admitted to
the Central Clinical Hospital on Nov. 22. He appeared in the
Kremlin for three hours on Monday to fire several top aides and
then returned to his hospital bed.
	   ``Doctors are generally satisfied with the president's
condition,'' Yakushkin told the Interfax news agency. Yeltsin will
continue to receive ``periodic checkups at the hospital,'' he
added.
	   Yeltsin, 67, insists that he has no serious health problems, but
after so many illnesses in recent years, few believe he will be
able to maintain a normal working schedule.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who is dealing with the
country's economic turmoil, said Yeltsin can ``perfectly perform''
his duties and will ``work until the end of his term'' in 2000. His
remarks were published Wednesday in the Nezavisimaya Gazeta
newspaper.
	   Primakov has handled many presidential duties in recent months,
and he gathered his top ministers Wednesday to work out next year's
austere budget.
	   Yeltsin did not have any meetings planned Wednesday and there
was no word on when he might return to the Kremlin.
	   Yeltsin has been a part-time president for months as his health
has declined. He has said almost nothing about Russia's economic
crisis, which hit four months ago, partly in response to Asia's
economic travails.
	   The president's latest illness clearly demonstrated that he is
not involved in the day-to-day running of the government, though he
remains extremely sensitive to any suggestions that he's a lame
duck, or that he won't serve out his term until the year 2000.
	   The president's only major announcement during his illness was
the dismissal of his aides, some of whom had dared to comment on
the president's health problems.
	   The country remains in a deep recession, with the economy
expected to shrink about 5 percent this year and forecasts pointing
toward a similar contraction, if not worse, next year.
	   Russia in the 1990s has suffered one of the worst depressions
ever experienced by an industrial nation, and Yeltsin no longer
even pretends to offer solutions to the country's entrenched
problems.

Cathay Pacific winging its way through turbulence, executive says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARCOS CALO MEDINA &QC;

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Cathay Pacific Airways took a big hit when Hong
Kong's new airport opened, and faces continued turbulence amid
Asia's economic turmoil, a top executive said Wednesday.
	   Cathay Pacific lost some 400 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 51.3 million) in revenue in the months after the Chek Lap Kok
airport's disastrous opening in July, just as Asia's airlines were
running into troubles brought on by the economic crisis.
	   ``When you have an economic downturn, air travel goes down as
well,'' Philip Chen, the airline's chief operating officer, told
reporters. Chen would not comment on the carrier's future business
or earnings prospects.
	   But he said the tough times have put pressure on Cathay Pacific
managers, who are now struggling ``to make every single dollar
pay.'' Chen added that the airline will be under pressure to cut
costs for at least another year.
	   Cathay Pacific's shares fell by 4.4 percent Wednesday on the
Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
	   The airline recently announced its first-ever losses of 175
million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 22.4 million) for the first
half of 1998, compared with a profit of 1.07 billion Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 137 million) in January-June last year.
	   Cathay suffered badly when the showcase airport at its hub
opened with big troubles on July 6. Computer breakdowns and system
problems crippled both passenger and cargo services, with the cargo
problems persisting for weeks.
	   But despite the current financial constraints, Chen said Cathay
Pacific was determined to make Hong Kong Asia's ``aviation hub,''
adding that the airline hasn't ruled out the possibility of
expanding into Asia with an investment into the ailing Philippine
Airlines.
	   Chen disputed suggestions that Cathay's announcement last week
that it had called off negotiations with PAL was a negotiating
tactic. Chen added that although talks with PAL were over for now,
Cathay was keeping ``informal channels'' open with the Philippine
government.
	   The talks fell apart as the two airlines wrangled over
management control and possible job cuts in PAL's bloated payroll.
	   Despite those difficulties, Chen acknowledged options to buy
into a rival carrier ``don't come during the good times.''
	   ``We can never say never,'' Chen said.
	   While admitting that ``the extent of management control was one
of the concerns,'' Chen said the airline ``never had specific plans
on the number of PAL staff to be retrenched.''
	   Cathay Pacific laid off nearly 800 staff members in January to
cut costs, and Chen did not rule out the possibility of further
layoffs or pay cuts.
	   ``We have to be realistic and go through this hardship period
together,'' Chen said.
	   Chen said, however, that Cathay Pacific planned no more job cuts
as severe as those from January.
	   He added that some 1,000 jobs have been trimmed off the payroll
either through layoffs or attrition, and that the airline will
continue to freeze hiring and cut staff through natural attrition.

	   MEGIDDO PRISON, Israel (AP) _ Palestinian men, women and even
children huddle together for hours each day in a cramped, guarded
tent with no bathrooms, no running water, nowhere to sit but the
ground and nothing to look at but the barbed-wire surrounding them
in Israel's maximum-security prison.
	   These aren't the prisoners, they're the visiting relatives.
	   Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have passed through
Israeli jails over three decades of Israeli occupation in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. Some served three months, some 30 years,
mostly on charges of militant or political acts against the Jewish
state.
	   Those who were not arrested had at least one family member who
was, making the issue of prisoner releases in the wake of peace
deals with Israel one of the most emotional quests for the
Palestinian public and its leadership.
	   It has united members from every political and social group in
Palestinian society, and divided those on the Israeli side.
	   ``When two peoples at war make peace, they hand over each
other's soldiers and prisoners and treat each other like equals.
There will be no peace between the Palestinian people and the
Israeli people as long as one Palestinian security prisoner remains
in jail,'' said Hisham Abdel Razek, who served 21 years in Israeli
jails and is now Minister for Prisoner Affairs in Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian Authority.
	   Widespread demonstrations for the release of 2,400 so-called
security prisoners _ often violent and often orchestrated by
Palestinian Authority officials _ have been held almost daily since
the two sides signed their latest Mideast accord in Washington in
October.
	   Palestinians had hoped the deal would mean the release of their
relatives. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however,
insists that none of the 750 promised releases will include those
involved in plotting or executing attacks against Israelis.
	   The United States, which brokered the deal, has not backed up
Palestinian claims that Israel is in violation of the agreement on
the prisoner issue, though it has hinted that the spirit of the
accord has been harmed by the dispute. U.S. President Bill Clinton
has promised to try to resolve the problem.
	   But with the issue burning in the streets and at the negotiating
table, even veteran Israeli security chief Gidon Ezra, now a
lawmaker in Netanyahu's Likud party, says the hard line on
prisoners needs to be re-examined.
	   ``The release of murderers is one of the most difficult things
that can happen. But on the other hand ... there are those who have
been in jail for more than 20 years and we need to tell them there
is a light at the end of the tunnel,'' Ezra told Israel radio.

Top Russian ministers to meet to work out budget
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: ADDS Primakov quotes in grafs 4-5. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Facing one of the toughest tests of its short
tenure, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's government gathered
Wednesday to work out what will be an austere budget in 1999.
	   Primakov convened his top ministers behind closed doors, first
to discuss military spending and then to take on the rest of the
budget, which is estimated at 575 billion rubles (dlrs 29 billion).
	   The government was not expected to have an easy time hammering
out the document. Russia faces massive debts to international
lenders and state workers on one side, and seriously shrinking
revenues on the other.
	   Primakov said government influence over the economy would be
stronger next year, but foreign investors should not be scared
away.
	   ``Steps to protect domestic producers will in no way infringe on
foreign investment,'' he said in an interview with the Nezavisimaya
Gazeta newspaper published Wednesday.
	   Primakov has said the government will probably not be able to
pay off all of its dlrs 17.5 billion in foreign debt next year, but
he is still promising to pay off all state workers.
	   If Primakov is to meet his obligations to the country's workers,
the government probably will have to print more money, an action
that will stoke inflation.
	   The International Monetary Fund and other lenders have already
frozen a dlrs 22.6 billion loan package, which Russia is desperate
to receive. Some budget projections even factor in the loans as
part of 1999 revenues.
	   The loans aside, initial projections show that the government
will cut expenditures drastically and try to streamline the
country's unwieldy tax system.
	   According to the Interfax news agency, the latest version of the
budget raises the 1999 estimate for the country's output from 3.8
trillion rubles (dlrs 190 billion) to 4 trillion rubles (dlrs 200
billion).
	   Interfax also projected that 32.6 billion rubles (dlrs 1.6
billion) would be printed to cover a portion of the budget deficit,
which is expected to exceed 100 billion rubles (dlrs 20 billion).
	   Many top officials were expecting swift passage for the budget.
Compared to previous governments, Primakov's team generally has
support in the Communist-dominated State Duma, or lower house.
	   ``Bearing in mind that Primakov enjoys such widespread
confidence, he is able to introduce a tough budget,'' said former
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, the leader of the Our Home is
Russia political movement.
	   Chernomyrdin praised early drafts of the 1999 budget, calling it
a dose of much-needed belt tightening.
	   ``It is the first time such a tough budget is presented,'' he
said. ``It is time to stop pumping air into the budget and
suffering from that later.
	   Primakov's full cabinet will meet Thursday, when it is expected
to approve the final budget draft and pass it along to the Duma for
approval.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The boards of directors of the Swedish
and British pharmaceutical companies Astra and Zeneca confirmed
Wednesday they intend to merge, making a global player out of two

	   The new company, AstraZeneca, would be the third-biggest company
worldwide in its field, with combined 1998 drug sales of about dlrs
10 billion. It would become Europe's No. 2 drug-maker.

	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Appealing for foreign assistance,
President Yoweri Museveni Wednesday promised to fight high level
corruption, but defended Uganda's increased military expenditure,
saying instability in neighboring countries made it necessary.
	   ``One impediment to more rapid economic development is
corruption by state officials,'' Museveni said at the opening of a
conference of more than 20 countries on financial aid to Uganda.
	   Foreign donors have pledged dlrs 1,190 million over the next
three years for social and economic programs in Uganda, while
Uganda says it needs dlrs 2,176 million. The donors expect to
decide by the end of the conference Friday whether to cover the
dlrs 986 million balance.
	   Donors earlier this week said they were concerned that public
funds targeting the fight against poverty were disappearing into
private hands and warned that without better accountability foreign
funding to Uganda would not be forthcoming.
	   It also criticized Uganda for increasing its military budget to
dlrs 164 million this year, up dlrs 30 million from the previous
year.
	   ``The worries within the donor community about the financial
implications of military interventions abroad might affect
budgeting for poverty eradication,'' said Netherlands Embassy
official Saskia de Lang, representing donor countries at a meeting
in Kampala on Monday.
	   Uganda, along with neighboring Rwanda, has been openly sending
troops and equipment to Congolese rebels fighting since Aug. 2 to
oust Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
	   Both countries argue that Kabila has allowed Rwandan and Ugandan
rebels to operate freely in eastern Congo and launch cross-border
attacks into their countries of origin.
	   Uganda is also combating Ugandan rebels operating out of
war-torn southern Sudan.
	   Museveni said instability in the region made it vital that
Uganda modernize its military. He noted the army had complied with
World Bank and International Monetary Fund demands to scale down.
	   ``Until 1993, we had an army of 100,000 officers and men,''
Museveni said. ``We reduced this to 40,000 on the clear
understanding that the smaller force will have to be better
equipped. We have not achieved the required level of equipping ...
accelarated by the present crises in the region: Congo and Sudan.''
	   He said the Great Lakes region lacked a regional force to
maintain peace and safeguard security for countries bordering war
zones.
	   Museveni, whose country's annual budget is 50 percent funded by
other countries and multilateral institutions, acknowledged high
level corruption was a difficult problem. He said he wanted to set
up mechanisms of government plants inside the judiciary the revenue
machinery, the land office, the immigration department, police and
medical services to weed out graft.
	   ``The army was easier to reform than all the other organs of
state: judiciary, civil service and police,'' he said. ``This is
because it takes much longer to train a judge than to train an army
officer.''
	   ``I might be forced to import cadres from abroad,'' Museveni
added. ``We might even import judges from abroad and what is wrong
with that if they are doing a good job. They might not be
corrupt.''

Top Russian ministers to meet to work out budget
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: ADDS Primakov quotes in grafs 4-5. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Facing one of the toughest tests of its short
tenure, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's government gathered
Wednesday to work out what will be an austere budget in 1999.
	   Primakov convened his top ministers behind closed doors, first
to discuss military spending and then to take on the rest of the
budget, which is estimated at 575 billion rubles (dlrs 29 billion).
	   The government was not expected to have an easy time hammering
out the document. Russia faces massive debts to international
lenders and state workers on one side, and seriously shrinking
revenues on the other.
	   Primakov said government influence over the economy would be
stronger next year, but foreign investors should not be scared
away.
	   ``Steps to protect domestic producers will in no way infringe on
foreign investment,'' he said in an interview with the Nezavisimaya
Gazeta newspaper published Wednesday.
	   Primakov has said the government will probably not be able to
pay off all of its dlrs 17.5 billion in foreign debt next year, but
he is still promising to pay off all state workers.
	   If Primakov is to meet his obligations to the country's workers,
the government probably will have to print more money, an action
that will stoke inflation.
	   The International Monetary Fund and other lenders have already
frozen a dlrs 22.6 billion loan package, which Russia is desperate
to receive. Some budget projections even factor in the loans as
part of 1999 revenues.
	   The loans aside, initial projections show that the government
will cut expenditures drastically and try to streamline the
country's unwieldy tax system.
	   According to the Interfax news agency, the latest version of the
budget raises the 1999 estimate for the country's output from 3.8
trillion rubles (dlrs 190 billion) to 4 trillion rubles (dlrs 200
billion).
	   Interfax also projected that 32.6 billion rubles (dlrs 1.6
billion) would be printed to cover a portion of the budget deficit,
which is expected to exceed 100 billion rubles (dlrs 20 billion).
	   Many top officials were expecting swift passage for the budget.
Compared to previous governments, Primakov's team generally has
support in the Communist-dominated State Duma, or lower house.
	   ``Bearing in mind that Primakov enjoys such widespread
confidence, he is able to introduce a tough budget,'' said former
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, the leader of the Our Home is
Russia political movement.
	   Chernomyrdin praised early drafts of the 1999 budget, calling it
a dose of much-needed belt tightening.
	   ``It is the first time such a tough budget is presented,'' he
said. ``It is time to stop pumping air into the budget and
suffering from that later.
	   Primakov's full cabinet will meet Thursday, when it is expected
to approve the final budget draft and pass it along to the Duma for
approval.

Indonesia denies report that it might leave OPEC
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RESTORES dropped word `the,' graf 1

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia on Wednesday denied reports
that it might quit the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries because of the group's failure to stem falling oil
prices.
	   ``No, we're not going to quit OPEC,'' Mines and Energy Minister
Kuntoro Mangusubroto told reporters.
	   The official Antara news agency reported Tuesday that Indonesia
might leave OPEC in light of the cartel's inability to stabilize
the global oil market.
	   ``After taking certain things into consideration, Indonesia has
decided it may quit OPEC,'' Antara quoted Rachmat Sudibyo, a senior
official at the Mines and Energy Ministry, as saying.
	   However, Kuntoro said Sudibyo's alleged comments ``must have
been a slip of the tongue.''
	   Indonesia is enduring its worst economic crisis in more than 30
years and oil and gas production is regarded as crucial to its
chances of recovery.
	   Sudibyo reportedly accused OPEC of lacking discipline. Almost
every member state wasn't sticking to agreed production cuts,
resulting in over supply and falling prices, Antara quoted him as
saying.
	   Sudibyo added, however, that because Indonesia would face
negative consequences if it left the group, it would first continue
discussions with other OPEC members about production quota
compliance.
	   An agreement among OPEC and non-OPEC oil nations in June called
for the withdrawal of more than 3.1 million barrels a day from
international markets in an attempt to boost prices.
	   However, despite the agreement, oil prices have continued to
languish at low levels not seen for more than a decade.
	   Recent industry surveys show that OPEC compliance with its
output pact is failing.
	   Indonesia, OPEC's only Asian member, can currently export 1.28
million barrels a day under OPEC guidelines. Kuntoro has previously
said that Indonesia was sticking to its production allocation, and
said he would like to see the June production cuts extended through
1999.
	   The oil cartel is set to meet again in March. Kuntoro said last
week that he expected the next meeting to come up with a new
agreement to help boost prices.

Effects of Soviet nuclear tests still felt in Kazakstan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BIRGIT BRAUER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEMIPALATINSK, Kazakstan (AP) _ Dispensary No. 4, set on the
vast plains of Central Asia, was a medical clinic unlike any other
in the Soviet Union.
	   Its secret task was to collect radiation data on people living
near Semipalatinsk, the huge nuclear testing site in northern
Kazakstan.
	   ``I knew what was going on, but I didn't tell anyone because I
didn't want to get 15 years (in a labor camp) or, worse, shot,''
said Boris Gusev, who was the clinic's chief doctor until 1991.
	   Gusev, 60, says he has done everything he can to help people
with his knowledge since Kazakstan gained independence in 1991 and
the sprawling test site was closed.
	   ``I feel very good because with what I knew and saw, I could do
something to help the people,'' said Gusev, now deputy director of
the state-run Scientific Research Institute for Radiation, Medicine
and Ecology.
	   But Gusev's change of heart comes too late for some of the
estimated 1.6 million people exposed to high radiation levels
during the 470 nuclear tests the Soviet military conducted here
between 1949 and 1989. More than 100 of the tests took place above
ground.
	   Before some explosions, local residents were told to leave their
houses and stay outside. The ground would shake, glass would
shatter and plates would fall from the cupboards. Sometimes
buildings would collapse, residents said.
	   No one told them that looking at the nuclear mushroom cloud
could damage their eyes _ or worse. No one warned them their
children and grandchildren would lose their teeth, turn gray in
their teens, suffer birth defects or die of cancer.
	   ``The nature of the deformities that resulted _ they're just
gruesome beyond belief,'' said Dr. James Warf, a chemistry
professor at the University of Southern California who has worked
on nuclear projects and studied the effects of radiation in
Semipalatinsk.
	   Warf described one instance where a stillborn baby had
abnormally large ears and a single eye in the middle of its
forehead.
	   ``This all comes from illnesses caused by radioactive
exposure,'' he said in a telephone interview.
	   The people were meant to be part of the experiment, and the
results are only now coming in. Kazakstan's cash-strapped
government has done little to address the problem in recent years,
and Russia simply ignores the issue.
	   Still, some Western experts have begun researching the effects
of radiation on the region. The Baylor College of Medicine in Texas
has undertaken a project to wade through old data that is now
becoming available.
	   ``Unfortunately, the types and duration of exposure, controversy
regarding historical data, the extended period of secrecy, and
current economic and health problems make it quite challenging,''
said Dr. Armin Weinberger, the head of the Center for Cancer
Control Research at Baylor.
	   At the Home for Psychiatric and Neurological Patients in
Semipalatinsk, the vast majority of the 350 patients are believed
to be victims of radiation, suffering from mental retardation,
schizophrenia and physical malformations, said director Shaiza
Rysbekova.
	   Kazakstan's government pays only a fraction of the dlrs 800,000
needed to run the home annually and medical staff have not been
paid for two months, Rysbekova said.
	   The state's lack of money also has prevented the payment of
compensation to many radiation victims. Residents who lived in the
Semipalatinsk area during the nuclear tests are entitled to a
one-time compensation.
	   The state made payments in 1996, but only 56,445 pensioners
received any money, getting the equivalent of dlrs 215 each.
	   It's still unclear how many people actually suffered health
problems as a result of the nuclear tests. All data collected
during the Soviet era was sent to Moscow and has not been made
public.
	   Kazak officials say that for every 100,000 people in
Semipalatinsk, 245 will contract cancer, compared with 174 in
Kazakstan as a whole. The pre-natal center in Semipalatinsk said
that of every 1,000 births in 1997, 400 babies had some health
problems or deformities and 47 died.
	   But statistics available in Kazakstan are flawed, and probably
understate the problem.
	   ``I was a doctor and was not allowed to diagnose cancer,'' said
Aliya Begalina, now head of disease prevention at the Semipalatinsk
Department of Health.
	   Begalina said she was not trained to recognize or treat the
symptoms of radiation sickness, such as swollen thyroid glands.
	   ``If someone died of cancer, we had to diagnose a heart problem
or another disease,'' she said.

Government proposes cutting welfare payments
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hoping to keep a lid on rising welfare costs as
Hong Kong struggles through recession, the government announced
proposals Wednesday to cut welfare payments and encourage
recipients to perform volunteer work.
	   Officials fear too much welfare spending could ``affect our
long-term ability to finance other essential social services such
as education, health and welfare services,'' said Katherine Fok,
secretary for health and welfare.
	   The government is facing a 13 billion Hong Kong dollar (U.S.
dlrs 1.67 billion) welfare bill this year, a fivefold increase in
as many years.
	   With unemployment at a record 5.3 percent in the third quarter _
the highest since the territory began keeping unemployment
statistics in 1981 _ and the economy mired in recession, the
government worries it could see welfare applications increase even
more sharply if reforms are not introduced.
	   The proposals include cuts of up to 20 percent in payments to
households with four or more able-bodied family members and
incentives for finding a full-time job.
	   The government pointed out that welfare payments for a
four-person household can come to more than 10,000 Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 1,282) a month, compared with the 5,000 Hong
Kong dollar to 9,000 Hong Kong dollar (U.S. dlrs 641 to U.S. dlrs
1,153) wages of many low-skilled jobs.
	   Standard payments to those who can't help themselves _ the
elderly, sick and people with disabilities _ would not be affected.
	   The government also proposed requiring welfare recipients to do
volunteer community work as a condition of receiving assistance.
	   ``This will also give them an opportunity to contribute to
society while preparing them for eventual gainful employment,'' the
statement said.
	   A six-week public consultation will be held before finalizing
the package to be implemented several months later.

Security increases as taekwondo fans turn rowdy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with tightened security after rowdy fan protest &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ While the sport stresses self-control,
spectators for taekwondo at the Asian Games have not felt
themselves bound by that custom. The result: flying bottles, and
tightened security.
	   More police were sent Wednesday after an outbreak the previous
day, when hundreds of angry fans stormed the stage, shouting
``Cheat, cheat,'' to protest a jury decision against Thailand's Usa
Silpajan in her bout with an Indonesian opponent.
	   Others threw water bottles and other objects to the mats from
the stands.
	   Police rushed on to the floor to guard the jury.
	   South Korean fans also staged a protest, though not as rowdy,
when judges decided that the lightweight gold medal should go to
Taiwan's Hsu Chih-ling instead of Korean favorite Lee Sun-hee.
	   In the end, Lee was awarded the gold.
	   The outbreaks jolted the World Taekwondo Federation, the
governing body that guided the sport to its inclusion in the 2000
Sydney Olympics.
	   Aside from added security, commentators appealed to the home
crowd to be graceful hosts.
	   Earlier, competitors and coaches disparaged the judging
procedures after China's middleweight He Luming was initially
awarded the gold medal Monday over South Korean Lee Hee-Young, but
the decision was reversed on a protest.
	   The case spotlighted dissatisfaction with judging techniques and
what some said was a threat of bias due to the large number of
South Korean judges. Taekwondo is a South Korean national sport.
	   Sung Sun-Tung, a coach for Taiwan's team, noted that the Asian
Games matches are scored by hand, with the four judges recording
marks on paper.
	   ``If it isn't electronically scored, we can't see the results
until the end of the round _ this isn't right at all,'' Sung said
Tuesday.
	   Though it debuted at Seoul in 1988 as a demonstration sport,
taekwondo officially becomes an Olympic sport in 2000. By then,
Sung hopes a different scoring method will be used.
	   ``We are all very excited at the prospect of being able to
compete in the Olympics,'' Sung said. ``We want to win gold there,
but first the referees must be fair.''

Report: Khmer Rouge leaders held in Thailand at U.S.'s wish
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Thai authorities are detaining the three most
senior Khmer Rouge leaders at the request of the United States,
which wants to see them tried for crimes against humanity, a
regional magazine reported Wednesday.
	   But Cambodian and Thai officials contacted by The Associated
Press said they did not know of any Khmer Rouge arrests in
Thailand.
	   Khmer Rouge military leader Ta Mok, political leader Khieu
Samphan and former party No. 2 Nuon Chea are being held in Sisaket
province, near the Cambodian border, a source close to the leaders
told the Far Eastern Economic Review, the magazine said in a
statement.
	   Thai and Khmer Rouge officials added that U.S. officials asked
the Thais to detain them while preparations were made for an
international war-crimes tribunal, it said.
	   U.S. officials refused to comment, and the Thai government
denied that Khmer Rouge leaders were on Thai soil, the statement
said. The issue of the magazine containing the full report goes on
sale Thursday.
	   Gen. Preap Tann, a Cambodian Defense Ministry official in charge
of tracking down senior Khmer Rouge and enticing lower-level rebels
to defect, told the AP Thursday he knew nothing about the reported
detentions.
	   An official from the Thai Embassy in Phnom Penh also said he had
not been informed of any Khmer Rouge arrests.
	   ``If it was the case, I don't think Bangkok would leave me so
mystified about it,'' said embassy First Secretary Pisanu
Suvanajata.
	   The three leaders, who led Khmer Rouge following the death of
Pol Pot in April, were left isolated by the disintegration of the
movement.
	   More than 1 million Cambodians were murdered or died of
starvation or disease during the Khmer Rouge's brutal 1975-79 rule
over Cambodia.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai gymnast, Saran Suwansa, fell
heavily after a failed vault Wednesday at the Asian Games and was
taken away on a stretcher, clutching himself in pain.
	   The gymnast dislocated a knee joint and was hospitalized
briefly, said Valerie McKenzie, a spokeswoman for the organizing
committee. It was unlikely that he would continue in the
competition, she said. He had been competing in the contest to find
the best all-around gymnast.
	   Saran failed to complete a final twist on a somersault off the
vault and appeared to wrench his knee as he landed awkwardly. He
lay on the mat for a while before he was taken away on a stretcher,
holding his head in pain.
	   Another gymnast from Uzbekistan, A. Gordeeva, also was hurt in
the floor event of the women's all-around competition. She was led
away clutching her elbow, fighting back tears.

Clashes, strike over prisoners on 11th anniversary of uprising
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Despite U.S. calls to stop violence, hundreds
of Palestinians marking the 11th anniversary of their uprising
against Israel stoned Israeli troops and motorists throughout the
West Bank on Wednesday.
	   Soldiers fired rubber bullets and tear gas, and at least three
Palestinians and one Israeli were hurt.
	   Palestinians in the West Bank and traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem also observed a commercial strike to press for the
release of Palestinians jailed for anti-Israeli activities, a key
point of contention between Israel and the Palestinians.
	   The violence came just four days before the start of U.S.
President Bill Clinton's visit to Israel and the Palestinian areas.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright demanded that Israel
and the Palestinians stick to the terms of the Wye River peace
agreement Clinton helped negotiate.
	   ``I have been in touch with both sides in the last few days,
making clear that it's important for the Palestinians to live up to
their obligations in terms of taking care of the security situation
and following through on what they are obligated to do, and also,
with the Israelis, not to add conditions,'' Albright said.
	   Last week, Israel suspended its next troop withdrawal in the
West Bank, citing Palestinian violations of the accord, including
alleged incitement against Israel over the prisoner issue.
	   The Palestinians said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held up
the agreement because he wanted to appease hard-line legislators
and prevent the fall of his crumbling coalition.
	   Arafat delivered a tough speech Wednesday to loyalists from his
Fatah faction in the West Bank town of Hebron, saying he would not
compromise on the prisoners. Arafat has come under growing domestic
criticism for his failure to win the release of large numbers of
so-called security prisoners during the Wye negotiations.
	   ``We tell our heroes, the prisoners, that we will not close our
eyes until we see them in front of us,'' Arafat told the crowd.
	   Under the accord, Israel is to release 750 prisoners by the end
of January. It freed 250 in a first stage last month, but most of
them were common criminals. Arafat said he had been made to believe
that all those freed were to be security prisoners.
	   Arafat also said Wednesday that he has turned down U.S. demands
that he stop talking in public about unilaterally declaring a
Palestinian state in May, at the end of the five-year autonomy
period. Arafat met Tuesday evening with U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis
Ross for nearly four hours, and was to hold more talks Wednesday.
	   ``In the last meeting with the Americans yesterday, they told me
not to use ... the word state,'' Arafat said. ``I told them we have
said it already and that's it.''
	   Earlier Tuesday, Ross met with Netanyahu, who delivered a list
of alleged Palestinian violations,
	   Netanyahu also said that under such circumstances, he could not
hand over more land. ``While they (the Palestinians) are busy
demolishing each and every clause in the Wye agreement, who could
expect me to transfer more territory,'' the Yediot Ahronot daily
quoted Netanyahu as telling Ross.
	   Five percent of the West Bank are to be transferred from sole
Israeli control to joint jurisdiction immediately after the
Palestine National Council, the Palestinians' parliament-in-exile,
on Monday reaffirms a decision by lesser bodies to revoke PLO
charter clauses calling for Israel's destruction.
	   Netanyahu has insisted that the PNC take a vote by a show of
hand, while the Palestinians say a vote is not required under the
agreement.
	   Netanyahu complained to Ross that the invitation for the PNC
meeting only said delegates were to listen to a Clinton speech.
	   ``This is not serious,'' Yediot quoted him as telling Clinton.
	   The Clinton trip was intended to shore up the Wye agreement, but
appeared to be achieving the opposite.
	   Israel fears that Clinton's visit to Gaza will give presidential
approval on the Palestinians' claims to independence. Yediot said
it polled Cabinet ministers and learned that nine out of 17 had
reservations about the Clinton visit.
	   The Palestinians, meanwhile, have stepped up their protests,
apparently in hopes of drawing the president's attention to the
fate of the prisoners.

Saudi beheaded for murder and attempted armed robbery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ A Saudi man convicted of murder and
attempted armed robbery was beheaded Wednesday, the official Saudi
Press Agency reported.
	   Hussein Mohammed Ajeeb was executed in the Western resort town
of Taif, the agency said.
	   He had been convicted of killing security guard Qassem Hussein
Sahari while trying to rob the Saudi Hollandi Bank in Taif, the
agency said.
	   Ajeeb killed Sahari by shooting him twice in the head with a
pistol, the agency said.
	   The agency did not say when the attempted robbery took place.
	   The execution raised to 27 the number of beheadings in the
kingdom this year. Last year 124 people were executed.
	   Saudi Arabia's Islamic courts impose the death sentence for
murder, rape, drug trafficking and armed robbery. Executions are
carried out with a sword in public.
	   Human rights groups have criticized the executions, saying that
the suspects do not receive fair trials, are denied lawyers and do
not have the right to appeal.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Rioters smashed store windows and burned
cars during a rally Wednesday by teachers and students against
education reforms.
	   Christmas shoppers ran for cover as hooligans tailing the rally
hurled rocks and gasoline bombs at stores and riot police. There
were no reports of serious injuries.
	   The anarchist youths, who routinely disrupt otherwise peaceful
demonstrations, targeted banks, fast food restaurants and private
cars during running battles with police. One masked arsonist threw
a gasoline bomb into a McDonald's restaurant facing parliament.
	   There were no immediate reports of arrests.
	   Wednesday's march by students and striking teachers stepped up a
widespread protest against the government-imposed reforms.
	   Joined by university students, an estimated 10,000 demonstrators
rallied in Athens, chanting slogans against Education Minister
Gerasimos Arsenis. They demanded the immediate withdrawal of the
reforms to shake up the course and marking systems at state schools
and universities.
	   Rallies were also held in dozens towns around Greece.
	   The mounting opposition has created another serious headache for
the government of Premier Costas Simitis, which is struggling to
push through austerity measures demanded by the European Union.
	   Students also have blocked busy roads and occupied hundreds of
high school buildings in a growing two-week campaign.
	   Arsenis has charged that protesting children were being
``deliberately misinformed'' about the reforms by teachers and
private night schools which most Greek children attend to keep up
with classes.
	   Greeks have a constitutional right to free schooling and
university, but education receives little public funding. Teachers
have for years been campaigning for better pay and work conditions.
	   They argue that schools are too poorly equipped for the reforms
to work.
	   The waves of strikes and protests apparently reflect eroding
support for the Simitis government, according to a nationwide poll
published Wednesday.
	   The Socialists fell 6.5 percentage points behind the main
opposition New Democracy conservative party. There was no margin of
error.
	   Respondents said they believed the state of education is one of
Greece's most serious problems.

<TEXT>
	   PHOENIX (AP) _ National Hockey League owners put off a decision
on whether the league will have its players return to the Olympics
in 2002.
	   ``They've more or less told us they have to know in February so
that they can get on with their lives in terms of how to proceed,''
NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said Monday. ``We're on a 60- to
90-day window to either do this or not.''
	   The issue has been a thorny one since the Nagano Olympics in
February, where the American NHL players were most notable for
playing poorly and trashing a suite in Olympic village. The NHL
took a three-week break to allow players to skate for their
national teams, only to see CBS relegate the games to its
late-night show.

	   MEGIDDO PRISON, Israel (AP) _ Palestinian men, women and even
children huddle together for hours each day in a cramped, guarded
tent with no bathrooms, no running water, nowhere to sit but the
ground and nothing to look at but the barbed-wire surrounding them
in Israel's maximum-security prison.
	   These aren't the prisoners, they're the visiting relatives.
	   Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have passed through
Israeli jails over three decades of Israeli occupation in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. Some served three months, some 30 years,
mostly on charges of militant or political acts against the Jewish
state.
	   Those who were not arrested had at least one family member who
was, making the issue of prisoner releases in the wake of peace
deals with Israel one of the most emotional quests for the
Palestinian public and its leadership.
	   It has united members from every political and social group in
Palestinian society, and divided those on the Israeli side.
	   ``When two peoples at war make peace, they hand over each
other's soldiers and prisoners and treat each other like equals.
There will be no peace between the Palestinian people and the
Israeli people as long as one Palestinian security prisoner remains
in jail,'' said Hisham Abdel Razek, who served 21 years in Israeli
jails and is now Minister for Prisoner Affairs in Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian Authority.
	   Widespread demonstrations for the release of 2,400 so-called
security prisoners _ often violent and often orchestrated by
Palestinian Authority officials _ have been held almost daily since
the two sides signed their latest Mideast accord in Washington in
October.
	   Palestinians had hoped the deal would mean the release of their
relatives. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however,
insists that none of the 750 promised releases will include those
involved in plotting or executing attacks against Israelis.
	   The United States, which brokered the deal, has not backed up
Palestinian claims that Israel is in violation of the agreement on
the prisoner issue, though it has hinted that the spirit of the
accord has been harmed by the dispute. U.S. President Bill Clinton
has promised to try to resolve the problem.
	   But with the issue burning in the streets and at the negotiating
table, even veteran Israeli security chief Gidon Ezra, now a
lawmaker in Netanyahu's Likud party, says the hard line on
prisoners needs to be re-examined.
	   ``The release of murderers is one of the most difficult things
that can happen. But on the other hand ... there are those who have
been in jail for more than 20 years and we need to tell them there
is a light at the end of the tunnel,'' Ezra told Israel radio.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Italian companies have lost an estimated
dlrs 200 million since Turkish consumers began boycotting their
goods last month to protest Italy's refusal to extradite a Kurdish
rebel leader, a trade official said Wednesday.
	   Among those hard-hit by the boycott is the Italian automaker
Fiat, whose Turkish partner Koc Holding may begin laying off
workers.
	   Fiat sales have fallen ``as if cut with a blade'' since the
boycott began Nov. 12, Rahmi Koc, the head of Koc Holding, was
quoted as saying Wednesday in the daily Hurriyet. Koc said he might
have to start laying off workers.

Philippine to fly U.S. congressman over disputed Spratly Islands
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado
said Wednesday that the Philippine government will fly a visiting
U.S. lawmaker to the disputed Spratly Islands in the South China
Sea, a move likely to anger China.
	   Mercado said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher would be flown over the
island chain in a Philippine air force plane on Thursday.
	   ``The government has decided to allow him to go,'' Mercado told
The Associated Press. ``It will help American policy makers have a
clear view of what exactly is happening there.''
	   He said Rohrabacher would be accompanied by Philippine
Congressman Roilo Golez, who chairs the Philippine House defense
committee, and other Philippine and U.S. Embassy officials.
	   Philippine Sen. Rodolfo Biazon, who heads the Senate committee
on national defense, opposed the trip, saying it could heighten
tension in the Spratlys.
	   The trip to the Spratlys would be the first in recent years by
an official from a country other than those making conflicting
claims to the chain.
	   The Spratlys, which straddle vital sea lanes in the South China
Sea, are claimed in whole by China, Vietnam and Taiwan, and in part
by Malaysia and the Philippines. Brunei claims one reef.
	   The Chinese Embassy in Manila said without elaborating that it
was opposed to Rohrabacher's planned trip.
	   Last month, Manila lodged a diplomatic protest with Beijing
after Chinese workers began enlarging buildings erected at Mischief
Reef in the Spratlys in 1995. Both countries claim the reef.
	   The reef, called Panganiban by the Philippines, is about 150
miles (240 kilometers) west of the western Philippine island of
Palawan.
	   The Chinese have insisted that the structures provide shelter
for Chinese fishermen and that repairs were necessary because of
damage from natural causes that might endanger the occupants.
Philippine officials say the structures could be used militarily.
	   Mercado said U.S. Ambassador Thomas Hubbard relayed to him
recently Rohrabacher's request to travel to the Spratlys. He said
the request was discussed by a Cabinet security group, which
approved it.
	   Mercado said the U.S. government is interested in maintaining
the security of important sea lanes that pass near the Spratlys.
	   Rohrabacher said he planned to report to the U.S. House Foreign
Affairs Committee, of which he is a member, on the situation in the
Spratlys and the general status of Philippine-U.S. relations.
	   He criticized China's moves in the area, calling them
``unacceptable.''
	   ``The free people of the world should not permit that to happen.
We should stick together and the United States should stick
together with the people of the Philippines if they are being
bullied by some big boy next door,'' he told reporters.
	   Aside from their strategic location, the Spratlys also are
believed to be sitting atop large deposits of oil and natural gas.

<TEXT>
	   The Gabonese opposition has already lashed out at the government
for the vote, charging Bongo's regime weakened the National
Electoral Commission, which oversaw the election, and rigged voter
lists.
	   Bongo's vast financial resources, dominance of the broadcast
media and widespread patronage system give him an enormous
advantage over his opponents and his victory was widely expected.
	   But despite widespread allegations of corruption and a history
authoritarianism, Bongo does retain a national following, in part
because of Gabon's stability and relatively high standard of
living. Bongo, who came to power in 1967 after the death of his
predecessor, relaxed his stranglehold on politics after
pro-democracy protests forced him to allow opposition parties in
1990.

	   The Gabonese opposition has already lashed out at the government
for the vote, charging Bongo's regime weakened the National
Electoral Commission, which oversaw the election, and rigged voter
lists.
	   Bongo's vast financial resources, dominance of the broadcast
media and widespread patronage system give him an enormous
advantage over his opponents and his victory was widely expected.
	   But despite widespread allegations of corruption and a history
authoritarianism, Bongo does retain a national following, in part
because of Gabon's stability and relatively high standard of
living. Bongo, who came to power in 1967 after the death of his
predecessor, relaxed his stranglehold on politics after
pro-democracy protests forced him to allow opposition parties in
1990.

Myanmar's Suu Kyi: struggle for democracy and human rights same
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EMBARGOED until 00:01 GMT Dec. 10

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ In a videotape smuggled out of
military-controlled Myanmar, Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi marked
the 50th anniversary Thursday of the United Nation's human rights
charter by declaring the struggle for those rights and the struggle
for democracy as one and the same.
	   ``Coming as I do from a country which suffers from systematic
violations of human rights by those in power,'' Suu Kyi said she
had come to ``deeply appreciate the wisdom and vision,'' of those
who drafted the U.N.'s Universal Declaration on Human Rights a half
century ago.
	   Myanmar's military leaders have insisted there is no human
rights problem or violations in their country.
	   But Suu Kyi's portrait of Myanmar has been supported by
Rajsoomer Lallah, a special envoy from U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan who visited Myanmar earlier this year.
	   Lallah reported that the government tortures and jails opponents
without trial, and its soldiers commit extrajudicial killings, gang
rapes and rounds up people for forced labor and to serve as human
mine sweepers, among many other violations of human rights.
	   Suu Kyi, who is the pivotal figure in Myanmar's democratic
movement, has spent the last nine years under house arrest or with
her movements strictly curtailed by the government.
	   Statements by the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner have become
extremely rare, as the government refuses to let her speak in
public and discourages journalists from attempting to meet her.
	   The military has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma, since 1962.
	   In the past several months, the military has attempted to
dismantle her political party, the National League for Democracy,
by arresting nearly a thousand of its members and refusing to
release them until they sign a statement quitting the party.
	   The government insists the party members were invited to guest
houses for discussions and resigned voluntarily.
	   Suu Kyi has said the resignations were coerced, and the party
leadership does not recognize them.
	   Among those arrested were hundreds of members of the parliament
elected in 1990 but which the military never allowed to convene.
The NLD won 82 percent of the seats in the assembly.
	   Suu Kyi said the U.N. declaration held particular relevance to
the people of her country because it expressly states that
governments should reflect the will of the people through periodic
and genuine elections.
	   ``Eight years ago democratic elections were held in my country,
but the results have not been honored by the military regime, and
the victorious party, the NLD, is subjected to the most grueling
persecution,'' Suu Kyi said.
	   ``So for us, as for many others, the struggle for democracy has
become synonymous with the struggle for human rights,'' she said.

Russia's nuclear chief hails deal with Iran
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Dismissing U.S. concerns, Russia's top nuclear
official said Wednesday that Moscow would go ahead with a project
to build a nuclear reactor in Iran, but won't provide weapons
technology.
	   ``Naturally, we will not forget about our international
obligations in the field of nuclear non-proliferation,'' said
Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov. ``Iran is our neighbor, and
the appearance of nuclear weapons there is far more dangerous to us
than to the United States across the ocean.''
	   Russia signed a dlrs 800 million deal with Iran to help build a
1,000-megawatt light-water reactor at Bushehr in 1995. Iranian
officials asked Moscow last month to conduct a feasibility study
for building another three reactors at the same site.
	   The United States and Israel have strongly criticized the
project, saying it might help Iran obtain technology needed to
develop nuclear weapons.
	   Iranian leaders deny any such intention and says the plant will
be used only to generate power.
	   The Russian government has acknowledged that Iran has tried to
acquire technology to build weapons of mass destruction. But Russia
claims it has foiled all such efforts.
	   The New York Times reported Tuesday that Iran had recruited five
Russian scientists who had worked on Russia's germ warfare program.
	   Russia's Foreign Ministry and the Iranian Embassy in Moscow both
declined to comment on the report.
	   Meanwhile, Moscow insists the nuclear reactor under construction
in Iran can only be used for peaceful purposes, and says it needs
the money the project will generate.
	   Adamov lashed out at the United States for what he called its
biased and politicized approach to the Russian-Iranian contract.
	   ``This is purely a business deal, that we carry out with extreme
precision, bearing in mind its political sensitivity,'' Adamov
said. ``Since Soviet times, our greatest potential has been in the
space, aviation and nuclear fields, and now the nation should earn
money using its intellectual and industrial potential.''
	   Adamov said he took Russian nuclear specialists on a trip to
Iran last month to discuss training Iranian nuclear scientists.
Russia was ready to provide extensive training, but Adamov declined
to comment on the details, saying they were still being finalized.
	   The Iranian project and similar deals with China and India will
generate more money for Russia's cash-strapped nuclear industry
than aid programs can provide, Adamov said.
	   ``American and other (aid) programs total tens of millions of
dollars, while building nuclear power plants will bring hundreds of
millions of dollars,'' he said.
	   The United States has been providing aid to Russian scientists
in hopes that they will not be tempted to sell their expertise to
countries that want to develop nuclear arms and weapons of mass
destruction.
	   The U.S. Energy Department recently announced a plan aimed at
creating new jobs at Russia's 10 nuclear research centers. The U.S.
program will provide Russia with about dlrs 30 million in aid over
the next year.
	   Adamov said that Russian officials also contemplated the risks
of the program, including possible U.S. espionage, and concluded
they were minimal.
	   ``Of course such a danger exists and American (secret) services
will try to use that channel,'' he said, adding that Russian
officials must keep an eye on Americans.
	   The plan doesn't envisage American access to the research
centers themselves, only to the cities where they are located. Such
a move would minimize security risks, Adamov said.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ During a meeting meant to improve
Russia's relationship with NATO, Russia's foreign minister firmly
reminded the 16 alliance countries Wednesday not to forget that the
United Nations is the top authority when considering international
intervention.
	   ``The main decision-making body remains the United Nations,''
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told a news conference after a meeting
of the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council. ``NATO should keep this
in mind while discussing its strategic concept.''
	   Ivanov spoke just 24 hours after NATO foreign ministers met to
discuss updating the alliance's political and military principles
that guide NATO in carrying out its mission.
	   NATO doctrine has moved away from defending against a major
Russian assault in Central Europe to one of dealing with regional
conflicts, ethnic violence, terrorism and weapons of mass
destruction.
	   The allied ministers' meeting lay the groundwork for the 50th
anniversary NATO summit in April in Washington. The summit will
welcome Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic as new members, over
Russia's objections.
	   On Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said NATO
must be prepared to take action beyond its borders.
	   But Ivanov stressed Wednesday that any NATO discussion on
whether it should be able to act independently was also ``a
question of external dimension.''
	   ``Any decision on the use of force in our view must only be
taken on the basis ... of the UN Charter.''
	   During their meeting, NATO and Russia agreed on a common agenda
for 1999. Next year's work program covers political and
defense-related fields, civil emergency planning and
defense-related environmental cooperation, NATO said.
	   They also discussed the situation in Kosovo, the Yugoslav
province beset by violence between Serb troops and ethnic Albanian
guerrillas.
	   ``Due to our joint (Russia and NATO) efforts, we've managed to
stop the violence in Kosovo,'' Ivanov said. Adding: ``A political
settlement is the only avenue open to us to establish lasting
peace.''
	   He said Russia and NATO are still discussing the possibility of
Russia taking part in NATO's air surveillance mission, but
``technical issues are still outstanding.'' Russia has yet to make
a formal proposal.
	   Wednesday's Russia-NATO meeting comes at the close of a
difficult year marred by conflicting views on what should be done
to defuse the violence in the separatist Serbian province of
Kosovo.
	   Russia persistently opposed allied plans for airstrikes against
the Serbs unless Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic complied
with Western demands to cutback security forces in Kosovo.
	   But Ivanov noted that Moscow and NATO had come a long way in
improving their relations over the past year.
	   ``We've come a long way from mistrust to mutual understanding,''
he said.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Despite U.S. calls to stop violence, hundreds
of Palestinians marking the 11th anniversary of their uprising
against Israel stoned Israeli troops and motorists throughout the
West Bank on Wednesday. Soldiers fired rubber bullets and tear gas,
and at least three Palestinians and one Israeli were hurt.
Palestinians in the West Bank and traditionally Arab east Jerusalem
also observed a commercial strike to press for the release of
Palestinians jailed for anti-Israeli activities, a key point of
contention between Israel and the Palestinians. The violence came
just four days before the start of U.S. President Bill Clinton's
visit to Israel and the Palestinian areas. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin was released from a hospital
Wednesday after more than two weeks of treatment for pneumonia, but
the Russian leader was not expected to return to full-time duty in
the Kremlin anytime soon. Yeltsin moved to a secluded country
residence, Rus, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) outside Moscow and
planned to remain there for a ``convalescence period,'' said his
spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin. Yeltsin has rarely been seen or heard
since he was admitted to the Central Clinical Hospital on Nov. 22.
He appeared in the Kremlin for three hours on Monday to fire
several top aides and then returned to his hospital bed. Yeltsin,
67, insists that he has no serious health problems, but after so
many illnesses in recent years, few believe he will be able to
maintain a normal working schedule. (RUSSIA-YELTSIN)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO and Russia are trying to set aside
their differences as they consider political and military ties
ranging from arms control to NATO help retraining Russian officers
for civilian life. Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and his 16
NATO counterparts sit down Wednesday to map out a common agenda for
1999, with both sides keen to signal their intent to enter the New
Year with a renewed spirit of cooperation. Russia has agreed to let
NATO experts to investigate how the year 2000 computer problem
could affect Russia's defense systems. NATO officials dismissed
stories that the `millennium bug' could cause Moscow's nuclear arms
to go haywire, but they want to share expertise with Russia to
avoid such things as malfunctioning of air-traffic control and
early warning systems. (NATO)
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Nearly 200 U.N. arms inspectors searched
Iraq for banned weapons Wednesday as Iraqi newspapers renewed
complaints that the inspections were not leading to a lifting of
U.N. sanctions. Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for the U.N. Special
Commission in charge of the arms inspections, said all the U.N.
arms experts in the country were working Wednesday. When asked if
they would be carrying out surprise visits, which have angered Iraq
before, she said only the ``inspectors will carry on a full range
of activities in Iraq.'' (IRAQ-UN)
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A chartered Egyptian airliner carrying about
150 people was hijacked Wednesday after taking off from Tunis,
Tunisia, and ordered to fly to neighboring Libya, but police said
it landed on the Tunisian island of Jerba. The hijackers were no
longer inside the plane and were refusing to speak to authorities,
an Egyptian police official said on condition of anonymity. It was
not clear why the plane landed in Jerba, an island 200 miles (320
kms) south of Tunisia's capital, Tunis. (EGYPT-HIJACK)

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO and Russia are trying to set aside
their differences as they consider political and military ties
ranging from arms control to NATO help retraining Russian officers
for civilian life. Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and his 16
NATO counterparts sit down Wednesday to map out a common agenda for
1999, with both sides keen to signal their intent to enter the New
Year with a renewed spirit of cooperation. Russia has agreed to let
NATO experts to investigate how the year 2000 computer problem
could affect Russia's defense systems. NATO officials dismissed
stories that the `millennium bug' could cause Moscow's nuclear arms
to go haywire, but they want to share expertise with Russia to
avoid such things as malfunctioning of air-traffic control and
early warning systems. (NATO)
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Nearly 200 U.N. arms inspectors searched
Iraq for banned weapons Wednesday as Iraqi newspapers renewed
complaints that the inspections were not leading to a lifting of
U.N. sanctions. Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for the U.N. Special
Commission in charge of the arms inspections, said all the U.N.
arms experts in the country were working Wednesday. When asked if
they would be carrying out surprise visits, which have angered Iraq
before, she said only the ``inspectors will carry on a full range
of activities in Iraq.'' (IRAQ-UN)
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A chartered Egyptian airliner carrying about
150 people was hijacked Wednesday after taking off from Tunis,
Tunisia, and ordered to fly to neighboring Libya, but police said
it landed on the Tunisian island of Jerba. The hijackers were no
longer inside the plane and were refusing to speak to authorities,
an Egyptian police official said on condition of anonymity. It was
not clear why the plane landed in Jerba, an island 200 miles (320
kms) south of Tunisia's capital, Tunis. (EGYPT-HIJACK)

Indonesian prosecutors question Suharto as students protest

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Facing allegations of massive
corruption over three decades in power, former President Suharto
was questioned by state prosecutors Wednesday amid a huge security
clampdown.
	   Later, police near the home of Suharto's successor, President
B.J. Habibie, clashed with hundreds of students who rejected the
government probe as cosmetic. A wave of other protests were held
across the city.
	   Dressed in a traditional batik shirt, 77-year-old Suharto smiled
after emerging with eight defense lawyers from four hours of
questioning.
	   Six investigators from the office of Indonesia's attorney
general asked him 43 questions about the source of his wealth. But
it remains unclear if Suharto will ever face prosecution.
	   ``No one is above the law,'' Suharto said softly before a throng
of reporters at the Jakarta High Attorney's Office. ``But every
citizen has the right to be protected by the law.''
	   ``I have answered all the questions and I am prepared to give
further explanation if the attorney general's office wishes,'' said
Suharto, who lives as a virtual recluse in his Jakarta home.
	   Convinced that the government is too beholden to Suharto to
conduct a thorough probe, students who want the former
authoritarian leader to be put on trial staged several protests
around Jakarta.
	   Anti-riot officers with sticks and shields pushed students away
from the headquarters of a charitable foundation that was formerly
controlled by Suharto and allegedly used to siphon off state money.
	   Police detained 31 students for allegedly not having a permit to
stage the demonstration, which was about 500 meters (yards) from
Habibie's residence. Privately-owned Anteve television reported
that 17 students were injured.
	   Several hundreds students took shelter in the nearby Ministry of
Health building after they were chased down a major road by
baton-wielding riot squads.
	   More than 1,000 students also rallied outside Jakarta's police
headquarters to demand the release of two activists who were
arrested and accused of abducting a plainclothes officer at a Nov.
27 rally. The officer was released after several hours.
	   Students staged several other protests elsewhere in the capital
and in at least three other cities.
	   Troops and armored personnel carriers blocked off main roads,
causing traffic chaos. Security was especially tight around
Suharto's house, a frequent target in recent weeks of pro-democracy
protesters who helped oust the president in May after 32 years in
power.
	   Riots over price increases caused by Indonesia's worst economic
crisis in decades had also eroded Suharto's once-impregnable
authority.
	   Critics have complained that Habibie has stalled efforts to
investigate his predecessor and one-time mentor because he and many
government officials are also suspected of graft during the Suharto
era.
	   Student protester Alex Joyo dismissed the Suharto summons as a
mere formality. A real investigation, he said, would ``drag down a
lot of Suharto cronies, including within Habibie's government.''
	   Suharto's legal adviser, Yohanes Yacob, said last week that
senior government officials could be dragged into ``messy
litigation'' if the former president is brought to court.
	   The interview focused on multi-million dollar charitable
foundations formerly under his control, a national car project run
by one of his sons with massive tax breaks, the contents of his
banks accounts and presidential decrees that allegedly benefited
his family and friends.
	   A spokesman for Attorney General Andi Mohammad Ghalib, who is a
three-star army general, said Suharto might be summoned again.
	   Suharto has been accused of draining the state of resources to
benefit the business empires of his children and associates,
thereby aggravating the country's economic malaise.
	   Forbes magazine this year estimated Suharto's wealth at dlrs 4
billion. Others say it is much higher.
	   Previously Suharto has denied any wrongdoing and has repeatedly
scoffed at accusations that he has stashed billions of dollars in
overseas bank accounts.
	   It was the third time since his resignation that Suharto has
been questioned by state lawyers, who earlier said they had found
no evidence of wrongdoing. Students said the process was a
whitewash, and Habibie revived the investigation after a wave of
protests.
	   State prosecutors investigating alleged corruption also
questioned Mohamad ``Bob'' Hasan, a former trade and industry
minister, for eight hours at the office of Ghalib, the attorney
general.
	   Hasan, a one-time golfing buddy of Suharto, is a business tycoon
with big interests in the timber industry.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian fighter jet crashed in the Far East on
Wednesday, but the fate of the pilot remained unknown, a news
report said.
	   The Su-27 fighter jet vanished off radar screens while on a
training flight near the city of Komsomolsk-on-Amur, about 6200
kilometers (3,900 miles) east of Moscow, the Interfax news agency
said, citing Russia's Defense Ministry.
	   Search helicopters found the crash site in the Khabarovsk
region, south of Komsomolsk-on-Amur, but the status of the pilot
was not immediately known, Interfax said.
	   The plane was on a routine flight with a seasoned pilot in the
cockpit, it said.
	   Russia's military aircraft have crashed frequently in recent
years due to a shortage of funds that has reduced the level of
maintenance and training.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1200 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Despite a lack of fresh buying incentives, most
Asian stock markets closed higher Wednesday. On the Tokyo market,
Asia's biggest, prices rose for a third straight session. The
benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 123.70 points, or
0.84 percent, to close at 14,931.90. In Singapore, prices rose 2.2
percent as speculation about more interest rate cuts gained
momentum sending the Straits Times Index to 1,424.59. In South
Korea, share prices jumped on hopes of an upgrade in the country's
credit rating. The key Kospi index rallied 3.3 percent to 526.52
points. In Taiwan, shares closed down 1.3 percent to 7,117.81.
Meanwhile, the dollar bought 118.78 yen in late afternoon trading,
down 1.08 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Facing one of the toughest tests of its short
tenure, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's government gathered
Wednesday to work out what will be an austere 1999 budget. Primakov
convened his top ministers behind closed doors, first to discuss
military spending and then to take on the rest of the budget, which
is estimated at 575 billion rubles (dlrs 29 billion). The
government was not expected to have an easy time hammering out the
document. Russia faces massive debts to international lenders and
state workers on one side, and seriously shrinking revenues on the
other. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Thousands of South Korean auto and
electronics workers staged rallies Wednesday to protest an industry
restructuring they fear will lead to mass layoffs. Pumping their
clenched fists into the freezing winter air, 800 Samsung Motors
workers picketed the car maker's headquarters in Seoul and vowed to
fight for their jobs. The workers were protesting an agreement
reached this week between President Kim Dae-jung and the top five
conglomerates, which called for the Hyundai, Samsung, Daewoo, LG
and SK groups to spin off half of their 264 subsidiaries.
(SKOREA-LABOR PROTEST)
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ The leaders of six Gulf
Arab states apparently have decided to postpone to March a decision
on cutting back their oil production. As the Gulf Cooperation
Council prepared to close its summit Wednesday, officials said the
meeting would end with a resolution giving its positions on Iran's
occupation of three Gulf islands, a unified customs tariff, and the
eight-year-old U.N. sanctions on Iraq. But despite intensive
discussions on the record-low price of oil, the leaders were not
convinced that further production cuts would shore up the market, a
Gulf official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
(GULF-SUMMIT)
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's Congress has less than a week to
approve the 1999 budget and, with no agreement on how to compensate
for billions of dollars in lost oil revenues, lawmakers are
scrambling to avoid an unprecedented constitutional crisis that
could paralyze the country. Some legislators are hoping to extend
the ordinary session, which ends Dec. 15, to vote on the budget
before the end of the year. But no one is sure what would happen if
the budget isn't passed by Dec. 31. Mexico's constitution doesn't
consider the possibility _ no such provision was needed in the 68
years that the ruling party had a majority in Congress and
rubber-stamped presidential initiatives. (MEXICO-BUDGET DEBACLE)

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A U.N. weapons inspection team turned back
after it was refused admission to an office of the ruling Baath
Party in Baghdad, state-run Iraqi radio said.
	   The radio said a U.N. weapons team at about 9 a.m. (0600 gmt)
tried to get into a headquarters of the party of Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein ``in a provocative manner ... without previous
announcement.''
	   The broadcast, which quoted the official Iraqi News Agency, said
the Baath Party official in charge of the headquarters demanded
that the chief inspector give him a written declaration ``on the
banned items'' his team was seeking.
	   ``The team rejected this and withdrew,'' the agency said.

Myanmar's Suu Kyi: struggle for democracy and human rights same
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ In a videotape smuggled out of
military-controlled Myanmar, Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi marked
the 50th anniversary Thursday of the United Nation's human rights
charter by declaring the struggle for those rights and the struggle
for democracy as one and the same.
	   ``Coming as I do from a country which suffers from systematic
violations of human rights by those in power,'' Suu Kyi said she
had come to ``deeply appreciate the wisdom and vision,'' of those
who drafted the U.N.'s Universal Declaration on Human Rights a half
century ago.
	   Myanmar's military leaders have insisted there is no human
rights problem or violations in their country.
	   But Suu Kyi's portrait of Myanmar has been supported by
Rajsoomer Lallah, a special envoy from U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan who visited Myanmar earlier this year.
	   Lallah reported that the government tortures and jails opponents
without trial, and its soldiers commit extrajudicial killings, gang
rapes and rounds up people for forced labor and to serve as human
mine sweepers, among many other violations of human rights.
	   Suu Kyi, who is the pivotal figure in Myanmar's democratic
movement, has spent the last nine years under house arrest or with
her movements strictly curtailed by the government.
	   Statements by the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner have become
extremely rare, as the government refuses to let her speak in
public and discourages journalists from attempting to meet her.
	   The military has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma, since 1962.
	   In the past several months, the military has attempted to
dismantle her political party, the National League for Democracy,
by arresting nearly a thousand of its members and refusing to
release them until they sign a statement quitting the party.
	   The government insists the party members were invited to guest
houses for discussions and resigned voluntarily.
	   Suu Kyi has said the resignations were coerced, and the party
leadership does not recognize them.
	   Among those arrested were hundreds of members of the parliament
elected in 1990 but which the military never allowed to convene.
The NLD won 82 percent of the seats in the assembly.
	   Suu Kyi said the U.N. declaration held particular relevance to
the people of her country because it expressly states that
governments should reflect the will of the people through periodic
and genuine elections.
	   ``Eight years ago democratic elections were held in my country,
but the results have not been honored by the military regime, and
the victorious party, the NLD, is subjected to the most grueling
persecution,'' Suu Kyi said.
	   ``So for us, as for many others, the struggle for democracy has
become synonymous with the struggle for human rights,'' she said.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Police arrested a woman Wednesday in a
mass-poisoning case in which arsenic-laced curry killed four people
and sickened dozens of others at a summer festival in southwestern
Japan.
	   Former insurance saleswoman Masumi Hayashi was charged with
murder and attempted murder for allegedly sprinkling the arsenic
into a pot of curry served at a festival in Wakayama, said a police
official, who only gave his surname, Miyamoto.
	   Two children died in the July 25 poisoning, which shook the
nation and was followed by a rash of apparent copy-cat poisonings.
A total of 63 people were sickened by the curry.
	   The case has attracted frenzied media attention in a country
still scarred from the Aum Shinrikyo religious cult's 1995 subway
nerve gas assault that killed 12 in Tokyo.
	   Hours before Hayashi was arrested, Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi expressed his gratitude to investigators.
	   ``I'd like to thank the Wakayama police for their efforts in
bringing the case to where it is now,'' Obuchi was quoted as saying
by Kyodo News.
	   On Wednesday, the suspect denied any involvement in the July
poisoning, Miyamoto said.
	   Hayashi had earlier been charged with allegedly serving
arsenic-laced meals to her 53-year-old husband Kenji Hayashi and
another man on several occasions in 1997 in an attempt to obtain
their life insurance money.
	   Kenji Hayashi has been charged in the earlier case with
insurance fraud.
	   Local media had been speculating for months that Hayashi may
have been behind the curry poisoning, but police have reportedly
found little more than circumstantial evidence linking her to the
murders.
	   Investigators have found arsenic under a sink in Hayashi's home
and in about 10 other spots on her property in Wakayama, about 450
kilometers (280 miles) southwest of Tokyo.
	   The Hayashis had been under police scrutiny for years, partly
because Kenji Hayashi ran a termite extermination company that gave
him access to poisonous chemicals.
	   The couple have repeatedly denied all charges brought against
them.
	   Police suspect Masumi poisoned the curry to obtain some 542
million yen (dlrs 4.5 million) in life insurance she had taken out
on five people who had taken part in gambling sessions at her home,
Kyodo News reported.
	   Hayashi allegedly tried to kill her husband to receive some 110
million yen (dlrs 920,000) in life insurance that she had secretly
taken out on him.
	   Japan's media converged on Wakayama this week as word leaked out
that Hayashi's arrest was imminent. Japan's national broadcaster
NHK devoted the first 30 minutes of its noon news broadcast
Wednesday to the expected arrest.
	   The poisoned curry case was followed by a string of poisonings
elsewhere in Japan, including the death of a man who drank a can of
tea laced with cyanide.
	   The attacks also have come as the nation is grappling with a
growing crime rate, a jump in juvenile delinquency and general
malaise related to the economy, now in its worst recession since
World War II.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan passengers rioted aboard a chartered
Egyptian airliner and demanded that the plane fly to Libya in
violation of U.N. sanctions, police said. But the pilot tricked
them and landed in neighboring Tunisia.
	   The plane, an MD-9O, was hijacked after take-off from San`a, the
capital of Yemen, en route to Tunis, Tunisia.
	   None of the passengers or crew was reported injured, and it was
unclear if the hijackers had weapons or took over the plane by
force of numbers.
	   The plane landed in Jerba, a Tunisian island about 80 kilometers
(50 miles) from Libya's northwest border, an airport official in
Jerba said, insisting his name not be used.
	   The pilot contacted Egyptian authorities by radio and reported a
large number of Libyan passengers had rioted and were demanding
that he fly to Libya's capital, Tripoli, in violation of a U.N. ban
on international flights to the country, an Egyptian police
official said.
	   About 150 Libyans were aboard the aircraft, which was chartered
by a private Egyptian company for a flight by Libyan businessmen, a
Cairo airport official said.
	   Police said that the aircraft itself belongs to EgyptAir, the
national carrier, and that Tunisian and Yemeni passengers also were
aboard.
	   Both the Egyptian police and Cairo airport officials spoke on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Libya has frequently violated the U.N. flight ban, which was
adopted in 1992 to force Libya to turn over two suspects wanted for
the bombing of an Pan Am jet over Scotland in 1988.
	   The police official said the pilot was told by Egyptian
authorities that he could fly to Libya under duress without
violating sanctions, but the pilot apparently tricked the hijackers
and landed in Jerba.
	   The hijackers were refusing to speak to authorities, the police
official said. It was unclear if they were still on the plane.
	   Jerba, an island 350 kilometers (210 miles) south of the capital
Tunis, is frequently used as a transit point for travelers going on
to Libya by land without violating the sanctions.

Two boys crash through thin ice and drown in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Two eight-year-old boys crashed through
thin ice and drowned while skating in western Ukraine, emergency
officials said Wednesday.
	   The boys, from the Shevchenko village, went missing Monday and
were found on Tuesday, the regional civil defense department said.
	   The accident occurred in the Zakarpattia region, which has been
hit by floods this year. The water channel where they fell had been
dug to provide an outlet for high waters, the report said.

Reports: China to focus on domestic growth in 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ With export growth slackening, China said
Wednesday it will focus next year on expanding domestic demand to
drive growth.
	   China already has launched a massive public-works program and
loosened bank credit to revive a slowing economy amid faltering
global growth and the worst financial crisis to strike Asia in
decades.
	   Goals for 1999 also include reforms of agriculture and
government finances, according to a strategy announced at the end
of a three-day meeting attended by President Jiang Zemin and other
top leaders.
	   China is expected to post growth this year above 7 percent _ the
highest of any major country, but below the 8 percent minimum
required to create jobs for millions of workers laid off by
bankrupt state companies.
	   Growth has been pushed up slightly by a dlrs 1.4 trillion
program of spending on new highways and other public works launched
in mid-1998 and more corporate and consumer lending by state banks.
	   Exports, which account for up to 25 percent of Chinese economic
growth, have stopped growing and even fell slightly for the past
two months, according to official figures.
	   ``Efforts will be made to ... expand export trade by every
means,'' the official Xinhua News Agency added.
	   Also attending the meeting were Li Peng, head of the Chinese
legislature, Vice President Hu Jintao and Politburo members Li
Ruihuan, Wei Jianxing and Li Lanqing.

Foreign secretary meets with Russians on Chechnya deaths
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
warned Britons Wednesday to stay away from Chechnya, where three
British citizens and a New Zealander were beheaded, and said he
wanted justice to be done.
	   Cook met with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov on the
sidelines of a NATO meeting here. He said Ivanov expressed the
condolences of his government to the families of the victims.
	   ``Neither the Russian foreign minister nor I underestimate the
difficulty of making progress in the lawless state in Chechnya,''
Cook said.
	   ``The Russian government throughout has sought to be as helpful
as it can within its power, but that power is very limited in
Chechnya,'' he said.
	   ``We want to know what happened. We want justice to be done.''
	   Chechen kidnappers beheaded the four foreign hostages because
they feared capture and wanted to prevent their victims from
serving as witnesses, an official in the breakaway territory said.
One alleged kidnapper was arrested Sunday, and his detention
triggered panic among the hostage-takers, Chechnya's Prosecutor
General Mansur Tagirov told the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The severed heads of the victims were found along a highway in
Chechnya on Tuesday.
	   ``Russia will spare no efforts to find the culprits,'' Ivanov
said.

Chinese, North Korean lifters break women's world records
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By THAKSINA KHAIKAEW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China set its third women's world
weightlifting record in three days at the Asian Games Wednesday,
and a North Korean set a world mark too, but had to settle for a
silver medal.
	   China's Chen Yanqing broke her own 8-month-old record of 97.5
kilograms in the snatch in 58-kilogram division competition,
lifting 98.0.
	   She also beat the old record in the jerk with a lift of 123.5,
but North Korea's Ri Song Hui grabbed away the record minutes later
by hoisting 125.0. China's Xu Xiongying had set the old world mark
of 123.0 in May.
	   Chen won the gold with a total of 220.0 to 217.5 for Ri.
Thailand's Khassaraporn Suta took the bronze with 210.0.
	   Chen's first lift in the snatch was 95.0, and since weights are
supposed to be increased by 2.5 kilograms at a time, her lift of
98.0 was counted as 97.5 for the total. In the jerk, she was given
credit for just 122.5 instead of the 123.5 she actually lifted.
	   That kept her from breaking the world mark of 220 for total.
	   ``I am very disappointed with the official marks they use for
judgment. I do not think it is right,'' Chen said.
	   As for quickly losing one world record to Ri, she said, ``I was
very surprised that the North Korean competitor could make it. She
was so fast and very impressive. However, I will try my best next
time in the World Championship.''
	   Chinese women lifters also had set world records on the first
two days of competition.
	   Thailand's team considered Khassaraporn its best hope for gold,
and she said, ``I apologize to Thai fans for this, but I tried my
best.''

	   The incident occurred as nearly 200 U.N. arms inspectors
searched for banned weapons in Iraq. Newspapers, meanwhile, renewed
complaints that the inspections were not leading to a lifting of
U.N. sanctions.
	   Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for the U.N. Special Commission in
charge of the arms inspections, said all the U.N. arms experts in
the country were working Wednesday.
	   When asked if they would be carrying out the surprise visits
that have angered Iraq before, she said only the ``inspectors will
carry on a full range of activities in Iraq.''
	   Such surprise visits in the past have resulted in confrontations
with the Iraqis.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Seventy-five percent of Russians feel that their
country does not observe human rights, a news report said
Wednesday.
	   The public has ``a rather negative opinion of the state of human
rights in the country,'' a presidential commission studying public
opinion said in a paper, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   When asked if human rights were being more widely observed in
recent years, 44 percent said conditions had gotten worse and 14
percent said the situation had improved, the report said.
	   Among those polled, 55 percent said the right most often
violated was equality under the law.
	   The commission report was based on data collected in 1997 and
early 1998 by the Russia's Public Opinion Foundation. The report
did not say how many people were polled, and no margin of error was
given.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Shunsuke Ito came into the world before
identical twin brother Shusuke and was in front of him again
Wednesday as they finished 1-2 in the 100-meter freestyle final at
the Asian Games.
	   The 22-year-olds, from Okayama, continued a strong Japanese
swimming performance after China's Chen Hau made the most of the
absence of world champion Chen Yan to give China a gold medal in
the women's 400-meter freestyle.
	   ``Our parents are here in Bangkok and it's great for us to be
able to show our thanks for them supporting us both,'' said
Shusuke.
	   The pair have different styles, with Shunsuke a fast starter and
Shusuke a strong finisher, and the elder brother's approach won out
as usual in races between the pair.
	   ``I'm just really happy to have a 1-2 with my brother,''
Shunsuke said. The pair are good friends as well as strong
competitors and discussed their tactics before the race.
	   ``I finished and I looked around for my brother and I could see
in his eyes that we did it,'' Shunsuke said.
	   Chen Yan, who won the event along with the 400-meter medley at
this year's world championships in Perth, remains ill with a
stomach ailment, according to team officials. The medley world
record holder trailed off badly to finish third in that event
Monday and missed Tuesday's 200 freestyle because of diarrhea.
	   Chen also failed to show up for the heats of the 400 freestyle
Wednesday. She would have been the clear favorite.
	   After 13 events of 32 in the pool, Japan held a 8-4 gold medal
lead over China with the other going to Taiwan's Tsai Shu-min in
the women's 200 freestyle.
	   Tsai was third in the 400 freestyle with Japan's Sachiko Yamada
in second.
	   Shunsuke clocked 51.29 to win the freestyle, a time that barely
put him into the world's top 100 for the year. Shusuke stayed off
the rankings list with his 52.07.
	   Japan's Tomoko Hagiwara was first in the women's 100 backstroke,
beating compatriot Mai Nakamura and South Korea's Choi Soo-min in a
race without any Chinese entrant.

	   The exact location of the Baath Party office involved in
Wednesday's incident was not immediately know.
	   There was no immediate comment from U.N. arms officials in
Baghdad.
	   Last month, a team was not allowed into a base run by Iranian
exiles, the Mujahedeen Khalq.
	   The incident occurred as nearly 200 U.N. arms inspectors were
searching for banned weapons in Iraq. Newspapers, meanwhile,
renewed complaints that the inspections were not leading to a
lifting of U.N. sanctions.
	   Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for the U.N. Special Commission in
charge of the arms inspections, said all the U.N. arms experts in
the country were working Wednesday.
	   When asked if they would be carrying out the surprise visits
that have angered Iraq before, she said only the ``inspectors will
carry on a full range of activities in Iraq.''
	   Such surprise visits in the past have resulted in confrontations
with the Iraqis.

Report: Singapore urges China not to exploit neighbors' economic
</HEADLINE>
crisis to gain Spratlys

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong urged
China not to exploit the Asian economic crisis to strengthen its
claim over the disputed Spratly islands, according to a magazine
report.
	   In an interview to appear in Thursday's Far Eastern Economic
Review, Goh was asked whether he thought China was taking advantage
of economic problems and disunity troubling the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations.
	   Chinese construction activities on the Mischief Reef, part of
the Spratly archipelago, has recently drawn a protest from the
Philippines.
	   ``No, I think you must expect China to have more sense than
that,'' Goh reportedly said. He added that ``the incident which has
happened is isolated.''
	   ``If China were to exploit the temporary difficulties in ASEAN,
then China would have lost its standing with ASEAN members because
that would lead to lots of suspicion,'' Goh was quoted as saying.
	   The Philippines and Malaysia claim some of the Spratly islands.
China, Vietnam and Taiwan claim all of them, while Brunei claims
one reef.
	   The tiny chain of islands and reefs straddle vital sea lanes in
the South China Sea and are believed to be rich in oil and
minerals.

	   On Tuesday, nine arms monitoring groups, two biological warfare
teams and a missile unit conducted 32 searches, some using
helicopters, the Iraqi News Agency said.
	   But UNSCOM spokeswoman Cross that the inspectors' latest work _
which would wrap up on Monday _ was no different than past
inspections.
	   ``There is nothing much particularly new or innovative about the
work they are doing now,'' she said later outside the U.N.
headquarters at the Canal Hotel.
	   Cross said the 130-140 inspectors on regular teams were working
Wednesday as well as some visiting experts. She would not give the
exact number involved but said it was ``a little less than 200.''
	   Iraqi newspapers, meanwhile, carried further accounts of Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz's comments in Moscow in which he said
there is a limit to Iraq's cooperation with the United Nations in
the search for weapons of mass destruction.
	   State-run newspapers first quoted Aziz's statements Tuesday.
``This situation is no longer acceptable,'' Aziz said, referring to
the U.N. sanctions that have blocked free export of Iraq's oil.
	   The Special Commission must certify Iraq has eliminated its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons as well as long-range
missiles before the sanctions can be lifted.
	   The sanctions, imposed after the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait,
have devastated Iraq's oil-based economy, and Iraqi officials have
long insisted they have fulfilled their obligations under U.N.
resolutions and that the sanctions should be lifted.
	   The arms inspectors _ who insist Iraq could still be hiding
weapons _ have been a constant source of confrontation between Iraq
and the United Nations.
	   In the latest flare-up, Iraq blocked surprise visits by the
inspectors for three months. They were only allowed to return in
mid-November under threat of U.S. and British airstrikes to force
compliance.
	   On Wednesday, the Iraqi press praised U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan's statement that a military attack against any country
must have approval of the Security Council.
	   Babil, the newspaper owned by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's
son Odai, said Annan's speech Tuesday to the French Parliament
means that ``the United States must realize its days of domination
are numbered now.''
	   In an apparent reference to NATO, Annan said that regional
organizations have an important world role, but ``any military
intervention by the international community must be approved by the
Security Council.''
	   However, in an interview published Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said the NATO alliance ``cannot be hostage
of a veto of this or that country against an operation.''
	   ``Because in such a case,'' she told the French daily Le Monde,
``NATO would be nothing more than a branch of the United Nations.''

Swiss white wine with a famous name holds up Europe agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ A still wine from a small lakeside
village with a famous French name was proving Wednesday to be the
last major stumbling block in tough negotiations between the
European Union and Switzerland.
	   At issue is French displeasure over Swiss winemakers' use of the
prestigious Champagne name for their unbubbly white, which sells
around 50,000 bottles each year.
	   But the Swiss vintners protest that they are only following the
Swiss practice of naming their wine after their village, which has
been called Champagne, with variations on the spelling, since the
earliest documents in 885 A.D.
	   Swiss Champagners, who tend their vines above Lake Neuchatel in
Western Switzerland, have been making wine since the 10th century.
The French region began producing its famous sparkling wine at the
end of the 17th century.
	   ``We are agreed on all questions except one,'' senior Swiss
foreign ministry official Jakob Kellenberger told Swiss radio after
an overnight session with EU representatives, admitting the Swiss
Champagne was the sticking point.
	   The French say the name can only be used for the famous
sparkling white wine made in the Champagne region of France.
	   And until the situation is sorted out, the French are holding
out against a set of bilateral trade agreements with Switzerland.
	   Last week, the EU and Switzerland struck a deal on transport,
concluding four years of tough negotiations. The agreement cleared
the way for a wider agreement covering areas like air transport and
labor.
	   The Swiss electorate voted six years ago against joining a loose
European free trade grouping.
	   Fearful of another snub at the ballot box, the government has
frozen an application to join the more closely knit 15-nation EU
trade bloc, which now surrounds the country, and has concentrated
on the bilateral deals.
	   The villagers of Champagne themselves are resigned to losing
their right to use the name.
	   ``If the Swiss confederation gives in, it will have to look at
financial compensation,'' vineyard manager Albert Banderet was
quoted as saying in the daily Le Matin newspaper.
	   A compromise solution which would involve the Swiss wine being
named ``Champagne Village'' was thought to be under discussion
Wednesday.
	   Swiss President Flavio Cotti told lawmakers the overnight talks
made ``very important'' progress.

Turkey demands formal recognition for EU membership
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey said Wednesday it wants the
European Union to make it a formal candidate for membership at its
summit later this week.
	   ``Turkey's expectancy is that its candidacy be approved and
confirmed legally,'' Foreign Ministry Spokesman Sermet Atacanli
told reporters.
	   He added that Turkish officials were spurning an invitation to a
summit dinner because Turkey wasn't a candidate.
	   Turkey suspended its dialogue with the EU last year after the
union decided not to begin membership talks with Ankara because of
Turkey's shaky human rights record and territorial disputes with
Greece.
	   An enlargement report for the Dec. 11-12 summit in Vienna
includes Turkey among the 11 countries negotiating membership, but
the list does not make it a candidate. Atacanli said the document
``is far from meeting Turkey's expectations.''

Mongolia ends seven-month-old political crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL KOHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) _ Mongolia's parliament approved a new
prime minister Wednesday, ending a 7-month-old political crisis
that paralyzed the fledgling democracy.
	   Janlaviin Narantsatsralt, the popular mayor of the capital, Ulan
Bator, was elected 36-21.
	   He will replace Tsakhiangin Elbegdorj, who has been a caretaker
prime minister of the majority Democratic coalition since being
forced to resign in July, two months after the opposition began a
boycott of Parliament over the privatization of a state bank.
	   The president and parliament failed to agree on five replacement
candidates, a constitutional court barred members of parliament
from serving in the government and one of most respected Mongolian
democratic politicians was murdered.
	   The death of S. Zorig in October raised fears that the former
Soviet client state's fragile nine-year-old transition to democracy
was being subverted. Police have not found the killers, fueling
suspicions that the death was politically motivated.
	   Zorig's murder partly helped resolve the deadlock. Thousands of
people thronged Ulan Bator's central square in a display of grief
and a cry for democracy. President Natsagiin Bagabandi, an
ex-communist, proposed six compromise candidates, including
Narantsatsralt.
	   Narantsatsralt's nomination gained strength in the past week.
The biggest party in the majority democratic coalition backed him
last week, and the junior coalition party reversed its opposition
Tuesday night.
	   ``The crisis is over, the coalition has taken steps to formulate
a government. The entire Cabinet could be complete in a week,''
said Brad Broadwell of the International Republican Institute, a
U.S.-group advising the government on democracy.
	   Narantsatsralt, however, will have to try to forge unity in the
fractured coalition and push ahead its free-market agenda. A
41-year-old Moscow trained land policy expert, Narantsatsralt has
had a largely unremarkable two-year reign as mayor of Mongolia's
capital.
	   He is a well-liked personality, and few blame him for the
capital's mounting piles of garbage and proliferating potholes.
When the government couldn't sell Ulan Bator's only skyscraper to
private investors, Narantsatsralt moved the mayor's office into it.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A chartered Egyptian airliner was hijacked
Tuesday after taking off from Yemen and was ordered to fly to
Libya, but police said it landed on the Tunisian island of Jerba.
	   The MD-9O was hijacked after it left San`a, the capital of the
Gulf nation of Yemen, en route to the Tunisian capital, Tunis.
Apparently none of the passengers or the crew was injured.
	   The pilot contacted Egyptian authorities by radio and reported a
large number of passengers had rioted and demanded he fly to the
Libyan capital, Tripoli, in violation of U.N. sanctions against
international flights to Libya, a police official said.
	   About 150 Libyans were aboard the craft, officials said; the
total number of passengers and crew members was not clear.
	   The plane was chartered by a private Egyptian company for a
flight by Libyan businessmen, according to a Cairo airport
official. Police said the craft itself belongs to EgyptAir, Egypt's
national carrier.
	   Both police and airport officials spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   The police official said the pilot was told by Egyptian
authorities that he could fly to Libya under duress without
violating sanctions, but the pilot apparently tricked the hijackers
and landed in Jerba.
	   The hijackers were refusing to speak to authorities, the police
official said. It was unclear whether they were still on the plane.
	   An official at Jerba airport, who refused to give his name,
confirmed the craft had landed there. Jerba, an island 200 miles
(320 kilometers) south of Tunis, is a frequent transit point that
lets travelers go on to Libya without violating the sanctions.
	   The U.N. flight ban was adopted in 1992 to force Libya to turn
over two suspects wanted in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over
Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.

Report: 30 massacred, raising terror wave toll to 100
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ An armed group in Algeria massacred at least 30
people overnight in a mountain town west of the capital Algiers,
French media reported Wednesday, raising to 100 the death toll from
a new wave of violence.
	   The group attacked the town of Tadjena, 200 kms (120 miles) west
of Algiers, France Info radio and LCI television reported.
	   There was no claim of responsibility, but suspicion fell on
Muslim militants waging a nearly 7-year-old campaign against the
military-backed government. More than 75,000 people have died.
	   With the latest reported massacre, attacks since the beginning
of the month have left at least 100 dead, mostly villagers in the
mountains west of the capital where Muslim militants remain active.
	   But Algiers has not been immune. On Monday, a bomb exploded near
a market in the capital, decapitating the person carrying the
explosive and injuring at least five people, eyewitnesses and an
official communique said.
	   The latest wave of attacks comes ahead of the Muslim holy month
of Ramadan. Beginning Dec. 20 this year, Ramadan has been a
particularly violent period during the insurgency.
	   The insurgency erupted after the government canceled January
1992 elections the now banned Islamic Salvation Front was expected
to win.

	   MALAGA, Spain (AP) _ A German pilot and her Spanish copilot
died, and their only passenger was injured, when their light
aircraft crashed in an inaccessible mountainous area near this
southern coastal city, a police spokesman said Wednesday.
	   The female German pilot was identified only as Commander
Fontreuow and her Spanish companion only as Alvaro V., police
spokesman Juan Antonio O'Donnel said.
	   O'Donnel was unable to confirm reports that the injured person
and only survivor was a German citizen. Calls to the hospital where
the survivor was taken went unanswered.
	   The plane took off from Malaga airport at 2.21 p.m. (13.21gmt)
Tuesday for a short recreational flight along the coast, O'Donnel
said.
	   Search services were alerted later the same day but did not
discover the wreckage until Wednesday.

Philippine Supreme Court rejects immunity for Imelda Marcos
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CLARO CORTES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday
that the government may not grant former first lady Imelda Marcos
immunity from criminal prosecution as part of any compromise over
billions of dollars she and her late husband allegedly stole from
public coffers.
	   The decision is likely to make the recovery of any of the
allegedly ill-gotten wealth much more difficult. In the 12 years
since former dictator Ferdinand Marcos was ousted in a ``people
power'' revolt, succeeding governments have been able to recover
only relatively small amounts.
	   The court ruled that Mrs. Marcos and her family, being principal
defendants in pending graft cases, could not be granted immunity
from prosecution as part of any deal.
	   It also rejected an aborted 1993 secret agreement between the
government and the Marcos family that would have divided the wealth
by a ratio of 75 to 25 respectively between the two sides, saying
it practically would have given the Marcoses ``a license to
perpetrate fraud against the government without any liability'' and
would set ``a dangerous precedent for public accountability.''
	   There has never been any clear public determination of the
amount of wealth accumulated by Marcos and his family during his 20
years in office.
	   In an interview last week with a local newspaper, Mrs. Marcos
made the startling claim that her late husband secretly owned most
of the country's largest companies, using ``cronies'' who owned the
stock on paper.
	   She also said she is planning to file a 500 billion peso (dlrs
12.8 billion) lawsuit against her husband's former associates,
claiming they betrayed her family's trust by keeping the assets for
themselves when Marcos was ousted from power in 1986.
	   On Wednesday, President Joseph Estrada urged Mrs. Marcos to file
evidence in court backing those claims.
	   Without such proof, her statements remain hearsay, Estrada told
reporters.
	   Estrada also said he is giving Mrs. Marcos a year to agree to a
compromise settlement of the ill-gotten wealth charges or face
further prosecution.
	   Mrs. Marcos has not spoken publicly about the newspaper
interview, but her claims of ownership have caused stock prices for
several of the companies to drop.
	   In trading Wednesday, major losers included telecommunications
giant Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co., Manila Electric Co.
and food conglomerate San Miguel Co., all claimed by Mrs. Marcos.
	   In the interview, Mrs. Marcos also told the Philippine Daily
Inquirer that her late husband owned 4,000 tons of gold.
	   Even members of Mrs. Marcos family were surprised by her
statements.
	   Her eldest daughter, Imelda ``Imee'' Marcos, said her mother's
claims were ``wild and crazy.'' Her children are supporting a
negotiated settlement with the government.
	   Mrs. Marcos was quoted by the newspaper as saying her husband
decided to acquire the companies to buy out U.S. interests and
avoid greater control of the Philippine economy by ethnic Chinese
businessmen.
	   Previously she has said her family acquired its wealth by
discovering vast treasures abandoned by Gen. Tomoyuki Yamashita,
the Japanese military commander in the Philippines during World War
II.
	   She also claimed her husband amassed wealth through savvy gold
transactions as a precious metal trader shortly after World War II
until the 1960s.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Demanding ``television under the people's
control,'' about 70 communists picketed outside Moscow's main
television center on Wednesday, a news report said.
	   The protesters, all members of the Moscow branch of the
Communist Party, want to set up a council to run Russia's
television networks, the Interfax news agency said.
	   The group was not protesting freedom of speech, but wants ``this
speech to be truthful, to reflect the mood of the masses,''
Interfax said, citing Alexander Kuvayev, a Communist Party deputy
in parliament.
	   The protesters also lambasted the hosts of two prominent weekly
news commentary programs, saying they ``throw mud at the
clear-thinking forces in society,'' according to Kuvayev.
	   Russian television networks, most of them owned in part or fully
by the government, lavished praise on President Boris Yeltsin
during his re-election campaign in 1996. They gave little coverage
to other candidates, including runner-up Gennady Zyuganov, the
Communist Party leader.

Germany demands that U.S. return Stasi spy files
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's intelligence
chief is publicly demanding that the United States return former
communist East German spy files the CIA allegedly grabbed at the
end of the Cold War.
	   ``It is unacceptable in the long run for the German government
that relevant files are sitting in the United States, and a
possible or likely double in Russia,'' Ernst Uhrlau said in an
interview for broadcast Wednesday night on ZDF television.
	   Uhrlau said the return of the records was in Germany's interest.
He said he was speaking out so ``the files aren't abused by third
parties, including for pressure,'' an apparent reference to
attempts to blackmail former East German spies.
	   The program that conducted the interview, ``Kennzeichen D,''
said it was the first time the German government has publicly asked
for the files back.
	   Existence of the files and repeated discreet German attempts to
win their return have been widely reported in German and U.S.
media, but the CIA has refused to acknowledge it has them.
``Kennzeichen D'' said they contain the names of some 13,000 spies.
	   German authorities say the files could help long-running efforts
to unmask people who worked for the Stasi, the East German state
security service, including its helpers in former West Germany
during the Cold War.
	   German intelligence officials reportedly have been allowed to
review the files at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, outside
Washington.
	   The Washington Post newspaper reported last month that the files
contain the names and other information about U.S., British and
West German citizens who worked for in the Stasi's foreign
operations wing of the Stasi.
	   Information from the files was used to convict two people _
Theresa Marie Squillacote and Kurt Alan Stand _ of espionage in
Virginia earlier this month, according to court records.

Hamed splits with long-time trainer Brendan Ingle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHEFFIELD, England (AP) _ World featherweight champion Prince
Naseem Hamed and his trainer Brendan Ingle have ended their 17-year
partnership.
	   Hamed, the 24-year-old unbeaten WBO featherweight champ, has had
a public falling-out with Ingle in the last several months after
Ingle criticized him in a recent book for being driven by money.
	   ``You cannot dismiss the time we have spent together, we have
shared some very special times,'' Hamed said in a statement. ``We
have both agreed that this is for the best. I have no regrets and
the relationship has taken its natural course.''
	   Ingle also said he harbored no hard feelings.
	   ``I hope he goes on to unify the featherweight titles and
becomes a legend,'' he said. ``And I believe he will.''
	   In his recently published book ``The Paddy and the Prince,''
Ingle revealed he twice had split with Hamed only to return.
	   ``Money has become his (Hamed's) god,'' Ingle wrote. ``He is
kidding everyone. All he wants to hear is... praise and having yes
men around him.''
	   Ingle was in Hamed's corner as an ``observer'' in his last title
defense a month ago in New York against Wayne McCullough, a
lackluster performance that was widely criticized.
	   Ingle's sons John and Dominic served as his corners in that
match. Hamed said he had also severed ties with those two.
	   Last month, Hamed's brother announced that the fighter was
splitting from promoter Frank Warren and handling his own affairs.
	   But Hamed said last weekend he had not dumped Warren.
	   ``I want to be with Frank Warren and he wants to be with me,''
he said. ``I believe he is a great promoter and there is no
split.''

	   On the Tokyo market, Asia's biggest, prices rose for a third
straight session, even though many investors took to the sidelines
ahead of Friday's settlement of December futures and options, when
prices might swing unpredictably.
	   Participants also turned cautious as they awaited Monday's
release of the Bank of Japan's closely-watched quarterly ``tankan''
business confidence survey.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 123.70 points,
or 0.84 percent, to close at 14,931.90. On Tuesday, the Nikkei had
gained 0.58 percent.
	   Traders said Parliament's swift approval of a 5.7 trillion yen
(dlrs 48 billion) supplementary budget Tuesday evening cushioned
the market's fall earlier in the day.
	   The extra budget will help fund the 24 trillion yen (dlrs 200
billion) economic stimulus package that the government unveiled
last month.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the U.S. dollar slipped against
the Japanese yen.
	   The dollar bought 119.10 yen, down 0.76 yen from late Tuesday in
Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 119.31 yen
overnight.
	   In Singapore, prices closed sharply higher as speculation about
more interest rate cuts gained momentum. The Straits Times Index
surged 2.2 percent to end at 1,424.59, above the psychologically
important level of 1,400 points.
	   Traders expect Singapore banks to lower their prime lending
rates _ the fifth time in three months _ by 0.25 percentage points
to 0.5 percent.
	   In South Korea, share prices jumped on hopes of an upgrade in
the country's credit rating, after rating agency Moody's Investors
Services Inc. upgraded the rating of bonds denominated in the local
currency, the won, late last week.
	   The key Kospi index rallied 3.3 percent to 526.52 points.
	   In Taiwan, shares ended lower for the second straight session as
investors sold technology companies after a U.S. regulatory ruling
went against Taiwanese computer chip makers in a dumping case.
	   The Weighted Price Index of the Taiwan Stock Exchange closed
down 1.3 percent to 7,117.81.
	   In Hong Kong, share prices ended almost unchanged in light
volume.
	   The Hang Seng Index added 10.21 points, or 0.1 percent, to close
at 10,361.29. The index had dropped 0.7 percent on Tuesday after a
surge of 4.7 percent Monday on surprise interest rate cuts in Hong
Kong and mainland China.
	   Elsewhere:
	   JAKARTA: Indonesia's key JSX index closed down 0.118 points at
398.783 in thin trading. Dealers said escalating student protests
following the questioning of former President Suharto over charges
of corruption during his 32-year reign added to the negative
sentiment.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: The blue-chip Composite Index jumped 2.2 percent
to 522.18 points, as local investors used a hefty trade surplus as
an excuse to jump back into the market.
	   MANILA: The Philippines' key PSE index shed 2.6 percent to
1,739.34 points. The absence of fresh positive news and a
still-unproven claim by former first lady Imelda Marcos about large
shareholdings caused investors to sell, traders said.
	   SYDNEY: Australian shares ended a bit lower in lackluster
trading. The key All Ordinaries index closed down 0.78 percent at
2,750.0 points.
	   WELLINGTON: The benchmark NZSE-40 capital index closed 0.32
percent higher at 1,918.95 points, led by market leaders Tranz Rail
Holdings Ltd. and Independent Newspapers Ltd.
	   BANGKOK: Thailand's benchmark SET index closed 2.7 percent
higher at 359.54 points on strong buying of banking and finance
shares after Siam Commercial Bank PCL's announcement Tuesday that
it may raise its capital with the government's help.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A U.N. weapons inspection team turned back
Wednesday after it was refused admission to an office of the ruling
Baath party in Baghdad, state-run Iraqi radio said.
	   It was the first time a U.N. team was blocked from conducting a
search for banned weapons since Richard Butler, head of the U.N.
Special Commission that oversees the inspectors, announced earlier
this week that ``surprise'' inspections would resume on Tuesday.
	   Last month, a team was not allowed into a base run by Iranian
exiles, the Mujahedeen Khalq.
	   Iraqi radio said a U.N. weapons team at about 9 a.m. (0600 gmt)
tried to get into a headquarters of the party of Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein ``in a provocative manner ... without previous
announcement.''
	   The broadcast, which quoted the official Iraqi News Agency, said
the Baath party official in charge of the headquarters demanded
that the head of the U.N. team give him a written declaration ``on
the banned items'' the team was seeking.
	   ``The team rejected this and withdrew,'' the agency said.
	   The exact location of the Baath Party office involved in
Wednesday's incident was not immediately known.
	   There was no immediate comment from U.N. arms officials in
Baghdad.
	   The incident occurred as nearly 200 U.N. inspectors searched for
banned weapons in Iraq.
	   Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for the Special Commission here,
said all the U.N. arms experts in the country were working
Wednesday.
	   Cross said the 130-140 inspectors on regular teams were working
as well as some visiting experts. She would not give the exact
number involved but said it was ``a little less than 200.''
	   When asked if they would be carrying out surprise visits, she
said only the ``inspectors will carry on a full range of activities
in Iraq.''
	   Unannounced visits in the past have been a major source of
friction with Iraq.
	   On Tuesday, nine arms monitoring groups, two biological warfare
teams and a missile unit conducted 32 searches, some using
helicopters, INA said.
	   Among the sites visited Tuesday were barracks of the Republican
Guards in Baghdad suburbs and army depots in and around the
capital, the London-based Al-Hayat newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Iraqi newspapers, meanwhile, carried further accounts of
comments by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz in Moscow in which he
said there is a limit to Iraq's cooperation with the United Nations
in the search for weapons of mass destruction.
	   State-run newspapers first quoted Aziz's statements on his
Russian trip Tuesday. ``This situation is no longer acceptable,''
Aziz said, referring to the U.N. sanctions that have blocked free
export of Iraq's oil.
	   The Special Commission must certify Iraq has eliminated its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons as well as long-range
missiles before the sanctions can be lifted.
	   The sanctions, imposed after the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait,
have devastated Iraq's oil-based economy, and Iraqi officials have
long insisted they have fulfilled their obligations under U.N.
resolutions and that the sanctions should be lifted.
	   The arms inspectors _ who insist Iraq could still be hiding
weapons _ have been a constant source of confrontation between Iraq
and the United Nations.
	   In the latest flare-up, Iraq blocked surprise visits by the
inspectors for three months. They were only allowed to return in
mid-November under threat of U.S. and British air strikes to force
compliance.
	   On Wednesday, the Iraqi press praised U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan's statement that a military attack against any country
must have approval of the Security Council.
	   Babil, the newspaper owned by Saddam's son Odai, said Annan's
speech to the French Parliament on Tuesday means that ``the United
States must realize its days of domination are numbered now.''
	   In an apparent reference to NATO, Annan said that regional
organizations have an important world role, but ``any military
intervention by the international community must be approved by the
Security Council.''
	   However, in an interview published Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said the NATO alliance ``cannot be hostage
of a veto of this or that country against an operation.''
	   ``Because in such a case,'' she told the French daily Le Monde,
``NATO would be nothing more than a branch of the United Nations.''

Israeli soldier whose beating shocked country to be
</HEADLINE>
court-martialed &QL; 
 &UR; With Israel-Palestinians &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Israeli army decided Tuesday to
court-martial a soldier whose beating by a Palestinian mob shocked
the country and froze the peace process.
	   Cpl. Assad Meyara, 19, will be charged with not carrying a
loaded weapon and leaving his base without permission.
	   However, the army will not bring charges against the young
soldier for not firing his M-16 rifle on his attackers, who smashed
the windows of the car he was traveling in, dragged him out and
struck him repeatedly in the head with chunks of concrete.
	   The attack took place last week in the West Bank town of
Ramallah. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
suspended the Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   The army spokesman's office said a soldier should have opened
fire under such circumstances. Meyara told investigators, however,
that he was unable to act because he was incapacitated by one of
the first rocks striking his head.
	   The attackers also stole Meyara's rifle as he ran to safety. The
pictures of Meyara cowering under the Palestinians and not trying
to fight back touched off a national debate over whether Israel had
lost its military nerve.
	   The army also said it will discipline Meyara's commanding
officer for not having given him proper instructions or adequate
shooting practice. Meyara's mother said he had only been in the
volatile West Bank for a few weeks.
	   The army also is taking disciplinary action against two officers
who drove by the crowd of stone throwers just minutes before the
attack on Meyara. Their jeep also was hit by stones, but they did
not stop to make the intersection safe for others or report the
incident.

President approves bill to legalize political groups
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan has legalized the formation of
political groups that may contest elections, a government-run
newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   President Omar el-Bashir signed into law late Tuesday a bill
that allows for ``political associations,'' Al-Anbaa said. The law
will come into effect Jan. 1.
	   The constitution that was approved in June does not mention the
right to form political parties, which el-Bashir banned after the
military coup that brought him to power in 1989. But it does grant
the right to organize political associations.
	   Some legislators have pressed hard to replace such a vague
phrase with ``political parties,'' but Hassan Turabi, the outgoing
speaker of parliament opposed such a change.
	   Turabi, an Islamic fundamentalist, is regarded as the real power
behind the government.
	   Sudanese opposition leaders in exile have rejected the new
constitution, which is based on Islamic law.
	   El-Bashir has said the door is open for dissidents to return
from exile and form political groups.
	   Earlier this month, Turabi, resigned from the speakership to
work full time for the National Congress, which is effectively
Sudan's ruling party.
	   The congress is expected to register under the new law. The move
means it will no longer be funded by the government, officials say.

Denmark has most food, Somalia the least, UN agency says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Denmark has more food per person than any other
country, while Somalia has the least, according to a new world
``food map'' released Wednesday by the U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization.
	   The map illustrates the nutritional intake in 177 countries from
1994 to 1996. After Denmark, the countries with the most food are
Portugal, Ireland, the United States and Greece, while Eritrea,
Afghanistan, Burundi and Mozambique are among the hungriest.
	   The FAO said more than 800 million people in developing
countries are chronically undernourished and another 2 billion
people suffer from deficiencies of vitamin A, iron and iodine. The
diets in poor countries also lack protein and fat.
	   People in prosperous countries consume an average of 3,340
calories a day, compared with just 2,060 in developing countries,
the FAO said. Anything under 2,100 puts someone at risk of
malnourishment.
	   In Somalia, people consume an average of only 1,580 calories a
day.
	   The director of the Rome-based agency's food and nutrition
division, John Lupien, said Ghana made the biggest strides in
recent years, increasing the food available per person by 22
percent. He said daily calorie intake rose from 2,100 to 2,560
between 1989 and 1996.

Philippine stocks plunge on profit-taking; index down 2.6 percent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with peso closing higher

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks were dragged
sharply lower Wednesday by continued profit-taking, particularly in
blue chip companies, traders said.
	   The peso closed higher against the dollar on moderate dollar
inflows, slack demand for the U.S. currency and the Japanese yen's
overnight gains, dealers said.
	   The Philippine Stock Exchange Index of 30 selected stocks fell
46.51 points, or 2.6 percent, to 1,769.34 after losing 18.51 points
Tuesday.
	   The absence of fresh positive news and a still-unproved claim by
former first lady Imelda Marcos that she actually owns many of the
country's large companies overshadowed improvements in the
country's economic fundamentals, causing investors to sell, traders
said.
	   ``I think there's still some selling left to the market,'' said
Jose Ricardo Garcia, executive vice president for Diversified
Securities.
	   The broader All Shares Index fell 14.33 points to 569.62 after
sliding 6.63 points Tuesday. Losers trounced gainers 85 to eight,
with 33 issues unchanged.
	   Among the major losers were Philippine Long Distance Telephone
Co., Manila Electric Co. and San Miguel Corp., all companies being
claimed by Mrs. Marcos. The former first lady recently said that
her late husband, Ferdinand, installed ``cronies'' who controlled
many of the Philippines' leading companies but that the
corporations were actually owned by him.
	   Marilene Katimbang, vice president of Magnum International
Securities, said investors were ignoring improvements in currency
and interest rates and using every ``flimsy excuse'' to liquidate
their positions ahead of the holidays.
	   ``Investors are out of the market. They're out shopping,''
Katimbang said. But she expects the market to recover toward the
end of the month once fund managers start to window-dress their
portfolios.
	   Chelsea Dipasupil, assistant vice president for research at RCBC
Securities, said fundamentals remain strong but that Mrs. Marcos'
claims had spawned some uncertainty.
	   In currency trading, the dollar averaged 38.682 pesos for the
day, down 0.8 percent from Tuesday's 38.983 pesos.
	   It traded in a thin range of 38.600 pesos to 38.760 pesos and
last changed hands at 38.740 pesos.
	   Traders said a combination of some dlrs 50 million in dollar
inflows and minimal dollar demand propped up the peso.
	   The dollar inflows came from direct foreign investments and
remittances from Filipinos working overseas, they said.
	   The central bank wasn't active on the spot market. It held its
overnight borrowing and lending rates at 13.375 percent and 15.375
percent, respectively.

Admission of guilt plunges Australian cricket into crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: recasts, adds byline &QL; 
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Test players Shane Warne and Mark
Waugh, admitting they were ``naive and stupid'' for taking money
from an Indian bookmaker, plunged Australian cricket into a
humiliating crisis Wednesday.
	   The admission by the pair was made even more controversial by an
admission by the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) that it had covered
up the affair and asked the International Cricket Council to do the
same.
	   Australian Prime Minister John Howard, a man who enjoys cricket
more than politics, led a chorus of disbelief over the ACB's
handling of the matter.
	   ``Australians love their cricket and anything that looks as
though it's knocking cricket off its pedestal is something that's
going to deeply disturb Australians,'' Howard said.
	   The revelation shook the cricket world and is almost certain to
force the International Cricket Council to address the subject of
illegal betting in the sport at its meeting next month in
Christchurch, New Zealand.
	   Waugh was fined 10,000 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 6,400) and
Warne 8,000 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 5,100) for selling
information about weather and pitch conditions to the bookmaker.
	   At a media conference Wednesday in Adelaide, site of the third
test between Australia and England that begins Friday, Warne and
Waugh each read a statement and then left the room refusing to
answer questions, leaving ACB chief executive Malcolm Speed to deal
with the matter.
	   The ACB kept the matter secret until late Tuesday and Speed
admitted the incident's leaking had damaged Australian cricket's
reputation.
	   Both Waugh and Warne denied any involvement in match fixing or
bribery and told Speed they had never bet on cricket.
	   Waugh said he took money from the Delhi-based bookmaker to
provide information the batsman considered ``mundane.''
	   ``He asked me general questions on what the Australian side
expected from
	   the pitch and weather conditions but at no stage did I discuss
team tactics or lineups,'' Waugh said.
	   Warne, whose hopes of one day being the Australian cricket
captain will be damaged by the revelations, said he deeply
regretted the contact with the bookmaker who gave him money in
return for answering routine questions about the state of the pitch
and the weather.
	   ``As the captain of Victoria and a senior Australian cricketer,
I regularly provide much more detailed information to the media
before any match I play,'' he said.
	   ``I've had no contact with the bookmaker since and am very
disappointed and sorry for my actions.''
	   In Lahore, Pakistan cricketer Salim Malik, accused by both Waugh
and Warne of taking bribes, said he was delighted to hear that the
two Australian cricketers were at the center of the controversy.
	   A judicial inquiry is being held into match-fixing charges
against former
	   captain Wasim Akram and Malik. They have denied the charges.
	   ``I am so happy that I really don't have words to express it,''
Malik told The Associated Press.
	   He promised to sue both Waugh and Warne, accusing the Australian
pair of defaming his character with charges of bribe taking.
	   ``I am definitely going to take a legal action against Shane
Warne and Mark Waugh,'' Malik said from Lahore where he is
preparing for a second Test against Zimbabwe.
	   ``They have really upset me and have spoiled my cricket for the
last two years,'' he said. ``They were taking the money from the
bookmakers . . . I am
	   innocent and they are the liars. . . I will definitely sue them
in court.''
	   Speed said he believed the pair, two of Australia's highest-paid
cricketers, spoke to the bookmaker between two and four times over
a period of about a month during the 1994 tour of Sri Lanka.
	   ``It is inevitable that Australian cricket's very high
reputation has been damaged by this incident,'' Speed said
Wednesday.
	   ``In hindsight a different approach might have been taken,''
said Speed, who was not employed by the board at the time of the
incident.
	   ``The position that had been taken by the board nearly four
years ago was that the matter not be made public.''
	   Former Australian captain and long-serving commentator Richie
Benaud said: ``One of the most appalling things is that it's been
covered up for so long.''
	   Former International Cricket Council (ICC) president Sir Clyde
Walcott said the ICC was told of the matter by the ACB four years
ago but asked to keep it confidential.
	   ``We were asked by the ACB to keep the matter confidential and
we decided to do so,'' Walcott said.
	   ``It would have done nothing for the image of the international
game of cricket to publicize these bad happenings.'' (djp)

Kidnappers beheaded hostages because they feared capture, official

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechen kidnappers beheaded four foreign
hostages because they feared capture and wanted to prevent their
victims from serving as witnesses, an official in the breakaway
territory said Wednesday.
	   One alleged kidnapper was arrested Sunday, and his detention
triggered panic among the hostage-takers, Chechnya's Prosecutor
General Mansur Tagirov told the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The kidnappers then killed the four hostages, three Britons and
a New Zealander, and their severed heads were found along a highway
in Chechnya on Tuesday.
	   Hundreds of Chechen law enforcement officers were searching for
the bodies on Wednesday, officials said.
	   Tagirov said authorities believe they know the names of those
involved in the kidnappings, but he did not release additional
details.
	   The victims _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf
Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were identified by their
former bodyguard. They were abducted Oct. 3 by unidentified gunmen
in Grozny, Chechnya's capital.
	   The men were working to restore phone services in Chechnya,
which was devastated during the 1994-6 war with Russia.
	   Chechnya now runs its own affairs, but its plagued by
kidnappings for ransom. Most hostages have been released, though
dozens remain in captivity.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook met his Russian counterpart
Igor Ivanov on Wednesday in Belgium and said, ``neither the Russian
foreign minister nor I underestimate the difficulty of making
progress in the lawless state in Chechnya.''
	   ``The Russian government throughout has sought to be as helpful
as it can within its power, but that power is very limited in
Chechnya,'' Cook added.
	   Ray Verth, chief executive of Granger Telecom, the British
company the hostages had worked for, said the deaths were
apparently the result of a rescue attempt by Chechen authorities
Monday that went ``tragically wrong.''
	   An Associated Press reporter saw the decapitated heads Tuesday
near the village of Assinovskaya, about 40 kilometers (25 miles)
west of Grozny, the Chechen capital. He did not see any sign of the
bodies.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin expressed outrage at the
killings and urged law enforcement officials to crack down on
kidnapping, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin told reporters.
	   This year, 176 people have been kidnapped in Chechnya and
surrounding regions in southern Russia, and 90 of them have been
released, officials have said.

South Korea moves into quarterfinals; Japan rallies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late games &QL; 
 &UR; By PATRICK MCDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Japan rallied from a goal down with two
late scores to beat Kuwait 2-1 Wednesday and keep alive its chances
of reaching the quarterfinals of the Asian Games soccer tournament.
	   Earlier, South Korea clinched a quarterfinal berth with a tight
2-1 victory over United Arab Emirates, although star striker Choi
Yong-soo was held scoreless.
	   With two victories in Group 2, South Korea is already in the
final eight. The UAE is winless in two matches in the second round.
	   Uzbekistan beat India 2-0 for its second victory, and clinched a
quarterfinal berth from Group 1.
	   In the group's other match, Turkmenistan and North Korea battled
to a 1-1 draw. Turkmenistan has a victory and a draw. North Korea
is hanging on with a loss and a draw.
	   Japan, South Korea's co-host for the 2002 World Cup, was under
intense pressure not to lose to Kuwait, a favorite to win the Asian
Games gold. Japan lost to South Korea on Monday.
	   Wednesday's result left both Japan and Kuwait with 1-1 records
in second-round play.
	   After a scoreless first half, the young, quick Japanese came out
attacking. But the more experienced Kuwaitis, with greater flair,
also continued to threaten, coming in close twice for shots that
went wide or over the crossbar.
	   The first goal came in the 78th minute, with Iran's Farj Laheeb
connecting from short range on a pass from Hani al-Saqer. That tied
him with teammate Jasem al-Huwaidi at the top of the games' scoring
table with eight apiece.
	   But it was little consolation when Japan's Yoshiteru Yamashita
equalized off a header with about 10 minutes left, splitting
between two defenders just above the penalty spot after a long
crossing pass.
	   Kuwait defender Husan Al-Khodari then opened the door to
disaster for his side by climbing over the back of Japan's Nozomi
Hiroyama in front of the goal and drawing a penalty.
	   Shunsuke Nakamura drilled the net to bring Japan ahead 2-1 and
keep alive its chance to join South Korea in the quarterfinals.
	   Japan's French coach, Philippe Troussier, said he could ``dream
again'' after what he admitted was an unexpected victory.
	   ``On paper we were not the favorites of this game,'' Troussier
said. ``For this reason I asked the players to play this game with
a free mind.''
	   Troussier acknowledged that the Kuwait side was more powerful
and experienced and said his players showed determination ``to the
last minute''.
	   ``We scored two goals in five minutes at the end of this match.
The pressure is off our shoulders today.''
	   Japanese fans were mostly subdued during most of the game, then
came alive with the first goal.
	   Meanwhile, the drum-pounding, flag-waving South Korean fans were
ecstatic at their team's victory.
	   Later, they cheered archrival Japan, which South Korea beat 2-0
on Monday.
	   ``I'd like to see Japan win and then meet them again in the
final,'' said South Korean travel agent Peter Jin, 30.
	   ``We could beat them again. It's a good rivalry.''
	   South Korea found a tougher opponent than it expected in the
United Arab Emirates. Both sides played tight defense, with the
Koreans looking to clinch a quarterfinal berth and the UAE
struggling to survive after a 5-0 loss in the group opener Monday
to Kuwait.
	   Korean attacker Choi, trailing the Kuwaiti duo in the games'
goals chart with six, was held to a pair of hopeless long shots.
	   But sustained pressure on the UAE opened up a quick drive in the
38th minute. Park Jin-sup's feints allowed a deep penetration
before he lofted a long pass back to midfield.
	   Yoon Jong-hwan met it and his shot from 25 meters blew past
Emirates keeper Rashed Yousif Humadi, who barely had time to move.
The goal was Yoon's second of the games.
	   Sultanrashed Kalbani tried to equalize a minute later but Korean
Kim Byung-ji stretched a couple of fingers on the ball to push it
to the near post and away.
	   A dangerous tackle by Ali Saleed Rashid eight minutes into the
second half gave South Korea a chance to add insurance. Midfielder
Yoo Sang-chul scored from the penalty spot, making it 2-0.
	   The Emirates quickly replied. A controlled pitch-hugging pass by
Kazim Ali Abdulla set up teammate Mohammed Ibrahim Alboloshi, whose
goal made it 2-1.
	   South Korean coach Hun Jung-moo said he will field his second
string against Kuwait.
	   ``Already we have entered the quarterfinals so we will let the
others who haven't played in the next game. I don't care about the
next match,'' he said.
	   He was a bit concerned about the scoreless Choi.
	   ``I hope he will score in the next game he plays,'' Hun said.
	   The Turkmenistan-North Korea encounter was scoreless for the
first half.
	   Ri Chang Gyu opened the scoring in the 70th minute.
Turkmenistan's Roman Bondarenko evened it with a minute left in
regulation time.

Poland rejects missile deal with Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Boeing statement in 18th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ In the latest disagreement between Poland
and Israel, Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek's government on Tuesday
scrapped a deal reached last year to buy Israeli-made missiles for
the Huzar helicopter.
	   The reversal drew a terse response from Israel's Defense
Ministry, which hinted at possible legal and political fallout from
the decision by Buzek's Cabinet.
	   It also continued a series of disputes between Israel and Poland
that reveal strained relations rooted in Jewish perceptions of
Polish anti-Semitism dating back to the Holocaust and decades of
communist rule in Poland while Israel was closely allied with the
United States.
	   Announcing the decision after Tuesday's weekly Cabinet meeting,
Buzek accused Israel of reneging on an agreement by Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to allow Poland to field test the NTD missile
under local conditions.
	   Buzek also called the missile deal signed by Poland's previous
leftist government a preliminary agreement. He said scrapping it
will have no legal or financial consequences, the state news agency
PAP reported.
	   Israel's Defense Ministry disputed Buzek's position in a brief
statement.
	   ``From Israel's point of view, the agreement that was signed in
October 1997 is still in force,'' the ministry said. ``Israel is
now considering its response _ political and legal.''
	   Following five years of negotiating with several potential
partners, Poland last year awarded the dlrs 800 million contract to
Israel's Rafael and Elbit Systems Ltd. companies to equip the Huzar
helicopters in line with NATO requirements.
	   Under the deal, which required approval from both governments,
Rafael was to supply the Huzar with anti-tank NTD missiles and
Elbit was to provide electronic integrating systems.
	   But Buzek's Solidarity-led government, which took office shortly
after the agreement was signed, criticized the handling of the
tenders by its ex-communist predecessors and demanded missile
tests.
	   It also decided to seek another tender for the integrating
systems, but has set no date for it.
	   Grzegorz Holdanowicz, who writes for the Polska Zbrojna military
magazine, noted the 1997 agreement with Israel made no mention of
field tests.
	   ``So the other side can say you demanded things that were not
mentioned in the agreement,'' he said, adding that Netanyahu's deal
was made verbally in April and therefore may be a non-issue.
	   With Poland scheduled to join NATO next year, it is trying to
bring its military arsenal up to NATO standards to meet all
requirements for membership.
	   The NTD missile experienced problems when tested in Israel from
February to July, according to Jane's Defense Weekly, a respected
military magazine. It reported in August that some missiles tested
in southern Lebanon went awry, with one killing a civilian.
	   Buzek said Tuesday that Israel wanted an eight-month
postponement in testing the missiles in Poland, which he called
``unacceptable.''
	   Holdanowicz noted that scrapping the deal with Israel further
delays equipping the Huzar with anti-tank weapons, but he added:
``If there are so many questions around this missile, some of them
real, some imagined, then we do not know how in the end it could
work out.''
	   In the United States, one of the unsuccessful bidders for the
Huzar contract _ the Boeing Company _ said in a statement it would
make a new offer when Poland opens the tender process again.
	   Poland's decision adds to a list of disputes with Israel.
Earlier this year, the Israeli government-run Yad Vashem Holocaust
museum formally complained to Poland's government about crosses
erected on a property adjoining the Auschwitz Nazi death camp, now
a museum.
	   On Monday, Poland announced that Israel refused to extradite a
Polish Jew who allegedly committed atrocities against German
prisoners in 1945.

Former Polish president speaks at Maine college
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WATERVILLE, Maine (AP) _ Lech Walesa won a 1983 Nobel Peace
Prize for staring down the hard-line communist government that
ruled his Polish homeland, but his passion now is global
cooperation rather than revolution.
	   ``Let us erase all the borders,'' Walesa told an overflow crowd
at Colby College on Monday night. ``Let us not shed any more blood
because of the borders.''
	   Walesa, a former Polish president and leader of a shipyard
strike in 1980 that swept across Poland and ushered in democratic
reforms, said work for long-term improvements rarely gets much
attention.
	   ``We live in a time when people remember ... revolutionaries and
people who make scandals,'' the 55-year-old, barrel-chested Walesa
said through an interpreter. ``The people who work very hard are
hardly remembered at all.''
	   Walesa said he was inspired by two beliefs when he led unarmed
workers and stared down hard line communist governments in Poland
and the former Soviet Union: belief in God, and in what he was
doing.
	   He said Solidarity was the result of a conscious decision to
avoid the mistakes of earlier Polish uprisings, in which violent
rebellion had been quashed by the Soviets.
	   ``We said, `We are not going to fight against you with arms
because you will blow up the world. But we're not going to work for
you, either,''' Walesa said.
	   In his remarks, Walesa spoke of the need for the world's
politicians to think in terms of decades, not in terms of just
winning the next election.
	   In the audience was Jozef Gandelman of Brewer, a Polish
immigrant who came to the United States 15 years ago. Gandelman
said he saw Walesa speak at a Solidarity rally at a tractor factory
outside Warsaw.
	   ``He had the energy,'' said Gandelman, who works in a medical
laboratory. ``He had the determination. He had ideas that he wanted
to convey.'

Russia blocks action against Yugoslavia over war crimes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Russia blocked the U.N. Security Council
from taking action against Yugoslavia on Tuesday for hindering the
work of the war crimes tribunal.
	   Judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald, president of the Yugoslav
tribunal, accused the government of President Slobodan Milosevic of
``unabashedly obstructing the explicit directives of the Security
Council.''
	   She asked the council to determine ``the appropriate measures''
to take against Belgrade, beyond its previous condemnation of
Yugoslavia's failure to cooperate with war crimes investigators and
demand for the arrest of the three men charged with organizing a
massacre.
	   But Russia, which has close religious and cultural ties to
Yugoslavia, blocked even a press statement from the council
president condemning Yugoslavia's latest failure to cooperate with
war crimes investigators, diplomats said, while speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   McDonald said a decision last month by the president of the
Military Court in Belgrade to conduct an investigation of war
crimes at the Vukovar hospital in November 1991 was in direct
contravention of Security Council resolution and the tribunal,
which has primacy over national courts.
	   The Military Court president had even asked for the tribunal's
files on the three men that formed the basis of the tribunal's
indictment, she said.
	   The three Serbs sought by the tribunal _ Veselin Sljivancanin,
Miroslav Radic and Milan Mrksic _ are accused of ordering the
massacre of 261 Croats taken out of the hospital in Vukovar in
eastern Croatia.
	   The breakup of Yugoslavia sparked a civil war in 1991 that left
more than 10,000 dead and thousands missing before the 1995 Dayton
peace accords ended the fighting.
	   In her statement to the council, which was made public, McDonald
said the tribunal was at ``a critical juncture'' because of the
Yugoslav government's blatant refusal to cooperate.
	   ``I urge you not to allow the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's
obstructionism to go unchecked for it sets a dangerous precedent,
one which even transcends its noncompliance,'' McDonald said.
	   For the moment the council took no action.
	   U.S. envoy Nancy Soderberg strongly condemned Belgrade's failure
to comply ``with its clear obligations under the requirements of
the tribunal.''
	   ``We believe the council should take appropriate action,''
Soderberg said, adding that she expected additional discussion in
the Security Council in the days and weeks ahead.
	   British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock also denounced Belgrade's
``blatant and flagrant disregard of the council's resolutions.''
	   Yugoslavia, which consists of Serbia and Montenegro, has refused
to extradite its citizens sought by the tribunal, citing a
constitutional ban on extradition.

Museveni promises donors to fight corruption, defends military
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING TO FIX HEADER
spending
 &UR; By HENRY WASSWA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Appealing for foreign assistance,
President Yoweri Museveni Wednesday promised to fight high level
corruption, but defended Uganda's increased military expenditure,
saying instability in neighboring countries made it necessary.
	   ``One impediment to more rapid economic development is
corruption by state officials,'' Museveni said at the opening of a
conference of more than 20 countries on financial aid to Uganda.
	   Foreign donors have pledged dlrs 1,190 million over the next
three years for social and economic programs in Uganda, while
Uganda says it needs dlrs 2,176 million. The donors expect to
decide by the end of the conference Friday whether to cover the
dlrs 986 million balance.
	   Donors earlier this week said they were concerned that public
funds targeting the fight against poverty were disappearing into
private hands and warned that without better accountability foreign
funding to Uganda would not be forthcoming.
	   It also criticized Uganda for increasing its military budget to
dlrs 164 million this year, up dlrs 30 million from the previous
year.
	   ``The worries within the donor community about the financial
implications of military interventions abroad might affect
budgeting for poverty eradication,'' said Netherlands Embassy
official Saskia de Lang, representing donor countries at a meeting
in Kampala on Monday.
	   Uganda, along with neighboring Rwanda, has been openly sending
troops and equipment to Congolese rebels fighting since Aug. 2 to
oust Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
	   Both countries argue that Kabila has allowed Rwandan and Ugandan
rebels to operate freely in eastern Congo and launch cross-border
attacks into their countries of origin.
	   Uganda is also combating Ugandan rebels operating out of
war-torn southern Sudan.
	   Museveni said instability in the region made it vital that
Uganda modernize its military. He noted the army had complied with
World Bank and International Monetary Fund demands to scale down.
	   ``Until 1993, we had an army of 100,000 officers and men,''
Museveni said. ``We reduced this to 40,000 on the clear
understanding that the smaller force will have to be better
equipped. We have not achieved the required level of equipping ...
accelarated by the present crises in the region: Congo and Sudan.''
	   He said the Great Lakes region lacked a regional force to
maintain peace and safeguard security for countries bordering war
zones.
	   Museveni, whose country's annual budget is 50 percent funded by
other countries and multilateral institutions, acknowledged high
level corruption was a difficult problem. He said he wanted to set
up mechanisms of government plants inside the judiciary the revenue
machinery, the land office, the immigration department, police and
medical services to weed out graft.
	   ``The army was easier to reform than all the other organs of
state: judiciary, civil service and police,'' he said. ``This is
because it takes much longer to train a judge than to train an army
officer.''
	   ``I might be forced to import cadres from abroad,'' Museveni
added. ``We might even import judges from abroad and what is wrong
with that if they are doing a good job. They might not be
corrupt.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The United States and its allies are
urging both sides in the Kosovo conflict to compromise after Serbs
and ethnic Albanians rejected Washington's latest formula for
bringing peace to the troubled province.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also criticized the
two sides, warning the Serbs to stop threats of new offensives and
telling the ethnic Albanians to abandon their ``rhetoric of
independence.''
	   Last week, U.S. envoy Christopher Hill offered a revised formula
for greater self-rule for Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's Serb
republic but with a majority ethnic Albanian population.
	   Both sides rejected the formula. A Serbian negotiator, Ratko
Markovic, said Tuesday the U.S. draft would require
``reconstructing the whole of Yugoslavia'' and would pave the way
for independence for ethnic Albanians.
	   The chief ethnic Albanian negotiator, Fehmi Agani, said the
proposal favored the Serbs. And Adem Demaci, chief spokesman of the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, suggested Tuesday that Hill should be
replaced.
	   ``Mr. Hill either doesn't understand the Albanian problems, or
he is leaning toward the Serbs,'' Demaci said. ``The State
Department should reconsider the results of his work ... (and) send
us more qualified people.''
	   Although the KLA is not a party to the deliberations, its
support is considered critical to ensuring that any future plan
actually brings peace to the province, where ethnic Albanians
outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and almost 300,000 ethnic
Albanians forced from their homes in a seven-month crackdown on
separatists by Serbian forces before an October peace accord.
	   The accord, reached under threat of NATO airstrikes, was seen as
a way to buy time for a diplomatic solution acceptable to both
Serbs and ethnic Albanians. But with little sign of progress, fears
are mounting that full-scale fighting could erupt, perhaps in the
spring, when snows will melt along the mountain passes to Albania,
where the rebels maintain sanctuaries.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, NATO foreign ministers endorsed U.S.
diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis and called on Serbs and
ethnic Albanians to ``move rapidly in a spirit of compromise and
accommodation.''
	   The ministers endorsed a plan that would give Kosovo ``a
substantially greater degree of autonomy and meaningful
self-administration'' but said any settlement must respect the
territorial integrity of Yugoslavia _ putting them at odds with
ethnic Albanians seeking independence.
	   The Americans and Europeans fear independence would lead to
similar demands by other ethnic Albanian communities elsewhere in
the southern Balkans.
	   ``Both Serb and Albanian leaders have made public statements
that do not help the cause of peace,'' Albright told reporters in
Brussels. ``Serb threats to launch a renewed offensive in Kosovo
are dangerous and we view them with extreme seriousness.''
	   Albright also said the ``Kosovo Albanian insistence on rhetoric
of independence and rejection of the ... draft agreement do have
help us to move forward.''

	   BLACE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Teachers dart uneasy glances out
windows of the bullet-pocked school, scanning the road for feared
police. Camouflage-clad rebels hunch behind nearby bushes. All the
schoolbooks are destroyed.
	   The tense province of Kosovo is hardly a suitable environment
for education.
	   But numerous villages are marking small triumphs across the
devastated region, re-opening war-damaged schools as they try to
restore some normalcy to shattered lives.
	   ``It's the first good event in our lives in several months,''
says Avni Hoxha, a 33-year-old ethnic Albanian, picking up his two
children from a battered school building where classes resumed in
this southwestern Kosovo village last week.
	   ``Children must go to school. They need an education,'' he said.
	   The ethnic Albanians say 56 schools were ruined, many others
damaged and still others abandoned in the panic to flee Serbian
forces during this year's punishing campaign against Kosovo
Albanian separatists.
	   Serb children, too, have suffered from safety fears and
relocation during the conflict in the Serbian province, where
Albanians outnumber Serbs by roughly 10 to 1. But the overwhelming
majority of the hundreds of people killed, and schools wrecked,
were ethnic Albanian.
	   As tens of thousands of refugees cautiously return home in the
wake of an October peace agreement and an uneasy truce, getting
schools back in operation has become a top priority. Schools in
Decani, Rastane and Blace are among those that re-opened recently,
with safety assurances from international peace verifiers.
	   ``It's a heartening thing,'' said American peace monitor Brett
Mattei, standing alongside one of the verifiers' orange Humvee
military vehicles in Blace. ``It shows villagers are feeling more
confident, more secure.''
	   Blace (pronounced BLAHT-say), located just off the
Pristina-Prizren highway that police and rebels battled over
fiercely, stood empty for four months until residents who had fled
to forests or other homes began trickling back in late October.
	   Overall, more than 100 houses were wrecked beyond repair. Hasty
repairs were made to get the school up and running despite a
bashed-in roof and no electricity in the village of 6,000.
	   Rain leaks into unusable classrooms, loose wires hang down, and
wooden beams and tree limbs are used to prop up the roof. With only
four rooms in use, the 600 children attend class in three shifts,
from 7:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.
	   Emotional scars reflect those left by machine-gun bullets on the
faded green outer walls.
	   In Shqipe Bllaca's second-grade class, where war trauma is
etched in the children's drawn faces, pupils and teacher shared
painful war experiences on the first day back in school. One girl
wept as she talked about all the burned houses, Bllaca recalled.
	   Eight-year-old Albina Kroni, gazing with big brown eyes,
struggled for words when asked to recount her family's situation
for visitors.
	   ``I was three months out of my home and my village, and I moved
to three other villages,'' she says solemnly. ``I missed my home.''
	   The village already was poor before the conflict began. The
schoolroom walls are bare and dirty, and there are no books.
	   The children's homework assignment won't be easy: Find a
notebook and a pen.
	   Teachers haven't been paid their monthly salary of $60 in five
months. Two are in jail, suspected by Serb police of ties to the
Kosovo Liberation Army. And there's only enough wood on hand to
keep the school stoves burning for two weeks.
	   But Bllaca, who wears a parka to ward off the classroom chill,
said the children and teachers are glad to be back.
	   ``I don't worry about our difficult conditions in school,'' the
32-year-old teacher says. ``I worry about our difficult conditions
in general.''
	   ``I worry about peace for our children.''
	   On the school playground, boys sing songs about the Kosovo
Liberation Army and play war games. They dream of becoming rebel
fighters, and sometimes flash victory signs as armored Serb police
cars rumble past on patrol.
	   Parents and teachers know there's no way to keep the war
atmosphere outside school walls.
	   ``It's our reality,'' says Muhamet Bajraktari, the school's
principal. ``They can't escape it.''

Effects of Soviet nuclear tests still felt in Kazakstan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BIRGIT BRAUER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEMIPALATINSK, Kazakstan (AP) _ Dispensary No. 4, set on the
vast plains of Central Asia, was a medical clinic unlike any other
in the Soviet Union.
	   Its secret task was to collect radiation data on people living
near Semipalatinsk, the huge nuclear testing site in northern
Kazakstan.
	   ``I knew what was going on, but I didn't tell anyone because I
didn't want to get 15 years (in a labor camp) or, worse, shot,''
said Boris Gusev, who was the clinic's chief doctor until 1991.
	   Gusev, 60, says he has done everything he can to help people
with his knowledge since Kazakstan gained independence in 1991 and
the sprawling test site was closed.
	   ``I feel very good because with what I knew and saw, I could do
something to help the people,'' said Gusev, now deputy director of
the state-run Scientific Research Institute for Radiation, Medicine
and Ecology.
	   But Gusev's change of heart comes too late for some of the
estimated 1.6 million people exposed to high radiation levels
during the 470 nuclear tests the Soviet military conducted here
between 1949 and 1989. More than 100 of the tests took place above
ground.
	   Before some explosions, local residents were told to leave their
houses and stay outside. The ground would shake, glass would
shatter and plates would fall from the cupboards. Sometimes
buildings would collapse, residents said.
	   No one told them that looking at the nuclear mushroom cloud
could damage their eyes _ or worse. No one warned them their
children and grandchildren would lose their teeth, turn gray in
their teens, suffer birth defects or die of cancer.
	   ``The nature of the deformities that resulted _ they're just
gruesome beyond belief,'' said Dr. James Warf, a chemistry
professor at the University of Southern California who has worked
on nuclear projects and studied the effects of radiation in
Semipalatinsk.
	   Warf described one instance where a stillborn baby had
abnormally large ears and a single eye in the middle of its
forehead.
	   ``This all comes from illnesses caused by radioactive
exposure,'' he said in a telephone interview.
	   The people were meant to be part of the experiment, and the
results are only now coming in. Kazakstan's cash-strapped
government has done little to address the problem in recent years,
and Russia simply ignores the issue.
	   Still, some Western experts have begun researching the effects
of radiation on the region. The Baylor College of Medicine in Texas
has undertaken a project to wade through old data that is now
becoming available.
	   ``Unfortunately, the types and duration of exposure, controversy
regarding historical data, the extended period of secrecy, and
current economic and health problems make it quite challenging,''
said Dr. Armin Weinberger, the head of the Center for Cancer
Control Research at Baylor.
	   At the Home for Psychiatric and Neurological Patients in
Semipalatinsk, the vast majority of the 350 patients are believed
to be victims of radiation, suffering from mental retardation,
schizophrenia and physical malformations, said director Shaiza
Rysbekova.
	   Kazakstan's government pays only a fraction of the $800,000
needed to run the home annually and medical staff have not been
paid for two months, Rysbekova said.
	   The state's lack of money also has prevented the payment of
compensation to many radiation victims. Residents who lived in the
Semipalatinsk area during the nuclear tests are entitled to a
one-time compensation.
	   The state made payments in 1996, but only 56,445 pensioners
received any money, getting the equivalent of $215 each.
	   It's still unclear how many people actually suffered health
problems as a result of the nuclear tests. All data collected
during the Soviet era was sent to Moscow and has not been made
public.
	   Kazak officials say that for every 100,000 people in
Semipalatinsk, 245 will contract cancer, compared with 174 in
Kazakstan as a whole. The pre-natal center in Semipalatinsk said
that of every 1,000 births in 1997, 400 babies had some health
problems or deformities and 47 died.
	   But statistics available in Kazakstan are flawed, and probably
understate the problem.
	   ``I was a doctor and was not allowed to diagnose cancer,'' said
Aliya Begalina, now head of disease prevention at the Semipalatinsk
Department of Health.
	   Begalina said she was not trained to recognize or treat the
symptoms of radiation sickness, such as swollen thyroid glands.
	   ``If someone died of cancer, we had to diagnose a heart problem
or another disease,'' she said.

Kidnappers beheaded hostages because they feared capture, official

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechen kidnappers beheaded four foreign
hostages because they feared capture and wanted to prevent their
victims from serving as witnesses, an official in the breakaway
territory said Wednesday.
	   One alleged kidnapper was arrested Sunday, and his detention
triggered panic among the hostage-takers, Chechnya's Prosecutor
General Mansur Tagirov told the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The kidnappers then killed the four hostages, three Britons and
a New Zealander, and their severed heads were found along a highway
in Chechnya on Tuesday.
	   Hundreds of Chechen law enforcement officers were searching for
the bodies on Wednesday, officials said.
	   Tagirov said authorities believe they know the names of those
involved in the kidnappings, but he did not release additional
details.
	   The victims _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf
Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were identified by their
former bodyguard. They were abducted Oct. 3 by unidentified gunmen
in Grozny, Chechnya's capital.
	   The men were working to restore phone services in Chechnya,
which was devastated during the 1994-6 war with Russia.
	   Chechnya now runs its own affairs, but its plagued by
kidnappings for ransom. Most hostages have been released, though
dozens remain in captivity.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook met his Russian counterpart
Igor Ivanov on Wednesday in Belgium and said, ``neither the Russian
foreign minister nor I underestimate the difficulty of making
progress in the lawless state in Chechnya.''
	   ``The Russian government throughout has sought to be as helpful
as it can within its power, but that power is very limited in
Chechnya,'' Cook added.
	   Ray Verth, chief executive of Granger Telecom, the British
company the hostages had worked for, said the deaths were
apparently the result of a rescue attempt by Chechen authorities
Monday that went ``tragically wrong.''
	   An Associated Press reporter saw the decapitated heads Tuesday
near the village of Assinovskaya, about 40 kilometers (25 miles)
west of Grozny, the Chechen capital. He did not see any sign of the
bodies.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin expressed outrage at the
killings and urged law enforcement officials to crack down on
kidnapping, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin told reporters.
	   This year, 176 people have been kidnapped in Chechnya and
surrounding regions in southern Russia, and 90 of them have been
released, officials have said.

Kosovo Albanians, Serbs agree: U.S. peace plan unacceptable

Ukrainian president signs decree to assist flood-stricken area
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ President Leonid Kuchma signed a decree to
set up a special economic zone in a western region that was hit by
devastating floods last month, a news report said Wednesday.
	   Kuchma signed the document Tuesday during a visit to
Zakarpattia, where November floods inundated around 100 villages
and claimed at least 17 lives.
	   More than 2,000 houses were fully destroyed in the flooding and
thousands of people were evacuated from Zakarpattia and other
western areas.
	   The decree grants tax breaks and other benefits for investments
in the area, along with other steps to boost economic activity, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   Kuchma also ordered his Cabinet to devise a state program for
combating similar floods in the future that would involve, in part,
cleaning river beds in western Ukraine.
	   Ukraine's government has allocated 10 million hryvna (dlrs 2.9
million) for the flood relief effort, and businesses across the
country have provided help.
	   ``Joining forces in the face of calamity, Ukraine showed that it
can solve a national problem together,'' Kuchma said.
	   A number of nations, as well as international organizations
including the Red Cross and United Nations, have sent aid to
Zakarpattia.

Ukrainian president approves World Bank loan agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ President Leonid Kuchma signed a draft law
ratifying a dlrs 200 million World Bank loan to modernize Kiev's
heating system, but financial trouble may delay the deal, the mayor
of Kiev said.
	   Kuchma signed the deal Monday, and Ukraine's parliament must now
ratify the document, the mayor, Oleksandr Omelchenko, said in
comments cited Wednesday by the Interfax news agency.
	   Even if parliament ratifies the 20-year, dlrs 200 million loan,
it is unclear whether Ukraine will see the money soon.
	   World Bank loan projects depend on the International Monetary
Fund's approval of the Ukrainian government's reform policy. The
IMF froze its loans to the country last week because of stalled
reforms.
	   That delay automatically put off further disbursement of the
World Bank's separate aid package.
	   The heating loan would repair old and build new boiler houses,
make improvements in the city's power plants and provide for better
management of the heating system as a whole.
	   Kiev's heating system is the third-largest in the former Soviet
Union after Moscow and St. Petersburg, providing heat and hot water
to most of the capital's estimated 3.5 million residents and its
industries.
	   Ukrainian authorities lacked the necessary funds to maintain
that system following the Soviet collapse in 1991, and many pipes
have suffered from corrosion.
	   Omelchenko estimated the entire renovation project at dlrs 249.4
million, and said the rest would be provided by city authorities
and the capital's Kyivenergo company.

Effects of Soviet nuclear tests still felt in Kazakstan

	   SEMIPALATINSK, Kazakstan (AP) _ Dispensary No. 4, set on the
vast plains of Central Asia, was a medical clinic unlike any other
in the Soviet Union.
	   Its secret task was to collect radiation data on people living
near Semipalatinsk, the huge nuclear testing site in northern
Kazakstan.
	   ``I knew what was going on, but I didn't tell anyone because I
didn't want to get 15 years (in a labor camp) or, worse, shot,''
said Boris Gusev, who was the clinic's chief doctor until 1991.
	   Gusev, 60, says he has done everything he can to help people
with his knowledge since Kazakstan gained independence in 1991 and
the sprawling test site was closed.
	   ``I feel very good because with what I knew and saw, I could do
something to help the people,'' said Gusev, now deputy director of
the state-run Scientific Research Institute for Radiation, Medicine
and Ecology.
	   But Gusev's change of heart comes too late for some of the
estimated 1.6 million people exposed to high radiation levels
during the 470 nuclear tests the Soviet military conducted here
between 1949 and 1989. More than 100 of the tests took place above
ground.
	   Before some explosions, local residents were told to leave their
houses and stay outside. The ground would shake, glass would
shatter and plates would fall from the cupboards. Sometimes
buildings would collapse, residents said.
	   No one told them that looking at the nuclear mushroom cloud
could damage their eyes _ or worse. No one warned them their
children and grandchildren would lose their teeth, turn gray in
their teens, suffer birth defects or die of cancer.
	   ``The nature of the deformities that resulted _ they're just
gruesome beyond belief,'' said Dr. James Warf, a chemistry
professor at the University of Southern California who has worked
on nuclear projects and studied the effects of radiation in
Semipalatinsk.
	   Warf described one instance where a stillborn baby had
abnormally large ears and a single eye in the middle of its
forehead.
	   ``This all comes from illnesses caused by radioactive
exposure,'' he said in a telephone interview.
	   The people were meant to be part of the experiment, and the
results are only now coming in. Kazakstan's cash-strapped
government has done little to address the problem in recent years,
and Russia simply ignores the issue.
	   Still, some Western experts have begun researching the effects
of radiation on the region. The Baylor College of Medicine in Texas
has undertaken a project to wade through old data that is now
becoming available.
	   ``Unfortunately, the types and duration of exposure, controversy
regarding historical data, the extended period of secrecy, and
current economic and health problems make it quite challenging,''
said Dr. Armin Weinberger, the head of the Center for Cancer
Control Research at Baylor.
	   At the Home for Psychiatric and Neurological Patients in
Semipalatinsk, the vast majority of the 350 patients are believed
to be victims of radiation, suffering from mental retardation,
schizophrenia and physical malformations, said director Shaiza
Rysbekova.
	   Kazakstan's government pays only a fraction of the dlrs 800,000
needed to run the home annually and medical staff have not been
paid for two months, Rysbekova said.
	   The state's lack of money also has prevented the payment of
compensation to many radiation victims. Residents who lived in the
Semipalatinsk area during the nuclear tests are entitled to a
one-time compensation.
	   The state made payments in 1996, but only 56,445 pensioners
received any money, getting the equivalent of dlrs 215 each.
	   It's still unclear how many people actually suffered health
problems as a result of the nuclear tests. All data collected
during the Soviet era was sent to Moscow and has not been made
public.
	   Kazak officials say that for every 100,000 people in
Semipalatinsk, 245 will contract cancer, compared with 174 in
Kazakstan as a whole. The pre-natal center in Semipalatinsk said
that of every 1,000 births in 1997, 400 babies had some health
problems or deformities and 47 died.
	   But statistics available in Kazakstan are flawed, and probably
understate the problem.
	   ``I was a doctor and was not allowed to diagnose cancer,'' said
Aliya Begalina, now head of disease prevention at the Semipalatinsk
Department of Health.
	   Begalina said she was not trained to recognize or treat the
symptoms of radiation sickness, such as swollen thyroid glands.
	   ``If someone died of cancer, we had to diagnose a heart problem
or another disease,'' she said.

Two boys crash through thin ice and drown in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Two eight-year-old boys crashed through
thin ice and drowned while skating in western Ukraine, emergency
officials said Wednesday.
	   The boys, from the Shevchenko village, went missing Monday and
were found on Tuesday, the regional civil defense department said.
	   The accident occurred in the Zakarpattia region, which has been
hit by floods this year. The water channel where they fell had been
dug to provide an outlet for high waters, the report said.

Egyptian airliner hijacked, lands in Tunisia

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan passengers rioted aboard a chartered
Egyptian airliner Tuesday and demanded that the plane fly to Libya
in violation of U.N. sanctions, police said. But the pilot tricked
them and landed in neighboring Tunisia.
	   The plane, an MD-9O, was hijacked after take-off from San`a, the
capital of Yemen, en route to Tunis, Tunisia.
	   None of the passengers or crew was reported injured, and it was
unclear if the hijackers had weapons or took over the plane by
force of numbers.
	   The plane landed in Jerba, a Tunisian island about 50 miles (80
kilometers) from Libya's northwest border, an airport official in
Jerba said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The pilot contacted Egyptian authorities by radio and reported a
large number of Libyan passengers had rioted and were demanding
that he fly to Libya's capital, Tripoli, in violation of a U.N. ban
on international flights to the country, an Egyptian police
official said.
	   About 150 Libyans were aboard the aircraft, which was chartered
by a private Egyptian company for a flight by Libyan businessmen, a
Cairo airport official said.
	   Police said the aircraft itself belongs to EgyptAir, the
national carrier, and that Tunisian and Yemeni passengers also were
aboard.
	   Both the Egyptian police and Cairo airport officials spoke on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Libya has frequently violated the U.N. flight ban, which was
adopted in 1992 to force Libya to turn over two suspects wanted for
the bombing of a Pan Am jet over Scotland in 1988.
	   The police official said the pilot was told by Egyptian
authorities that he could fly to Libya under duress without
violating sanctions, but the pilot apparently tricked the hijackers
and landed in Jerba.
	   The hijackers were refusing to speak to authorities, the police
official said. It was unclear if they were still on the plane.
	   Jerba, an island 210 miles (350 kilometers) south of the capital
Tunis, is frequently used as a transit point for travelers going on
to Libya by land.
	   The U.N. flight ban was adopted in 1992 to force Libya to turn
over two suspects wanted in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over
Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.

Zilk says he won't sue sources that accused him of spying
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NADIA RYBAROVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The former mayor of Vienna said
Wednesday he does not intend to sue sources who alleged he had
spied for the former communist secret police.
	   ``I have experienced similar situations and I know that in
politics, there's little sense to suing,'' Helmut Zilk told a news
conference Wednesday, one day after he met with Czech President
Vaclav Havel.
	   Zilk was to receive a high state decoration Oct. 28 in a
ceremony marking the 80th anniversary of the founding of the
Czechoslovak Republic in 1918.
	   But Havel withdrew the honor just three days before the
ceremony, after a source claimed that Zilk spied for the Czech
communist secret service and provided information that led to
several convictions.
	   Originally, Ivan Medek, the head of Havel's office, called the
information ``absolutely reliable.''
	   Last week, Foreign Minister Jan Kavan presented a formal apology
to Austrian Ambassador Peter Niesner, after Czech Ambassador Jiri
Grusa said in Vienna that the charges were ``irrelevant.''
	   Grusa said he based his comments on the findings of a special
Interior Ministry commission set up to examine the spy allegations.
According to Interior Minister Vaclav Grulich, from the files
available it is impossible to say whether Zilk was an agent and
only a court could decide.
	   But Zilk, who maintains his innocence, said he considers the
affair closed.
	   ``For me, this affair is over,'' he said.
	   Zilk said he was pleased by Havel's invitation and by the
apology the president extended for the part his staff played in the
affair.
	   ``The president told me that he himself cannot apologize as he
did not play any role in this, but apologized for the troubles his
staff had caused me,'' Zilk said.
	   Havel's decision to withdraw the honor provoked strong criticism
among Czech politicians, who said it damaged Czech-Austrian
relations. They accused Havel and his staff of acting
unprofessionally.
	   Zilk supported Havel's suggestion the whole affair may have been
aimed at discrediting Havel, rather than Zilk.
	   ``I am a well-known person, and popular ... so my person could
be fit to be used for such purposes,'' Zilk said.

U.S. historian says Khrushchev opposed Berlin Wall
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CARL HARTMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev long opposed
building the Berlin Wall and only consented weeks before it went
up, says an American historian who has been mining archives in
Berlin and Moscow for eight years.
	   The wall, according to historian Hope M. Harrison, was
championed by Walter Ulbricht, head of East Germany's Stalinist
government. Often derided as a puppet, Ulbricht swung weight in
Moscow but it was largely ``strength through weakness,'' she said.
Conditions were so bad under his rule that he needed help from the
Soviets to maintain the communist system.
	   Russian opposition to the idea of a wall to keep East Germans
from fleeing west went back to the period just after Stalin's death
in 1953, according to documents quoted by Ms. Harrison.
	   ``The Soviets kept saying: in order to solve this refugee
problem you need to change your policy, you need to lighten up.
Don't make life so hard for all of these people and then they'll
stay,'' she said at a Cold War study program last weekend at the
Woodrow Wilson Center for Scholars.
	   ``And the East German leadership under Ulbricht, in contrast,
simply didn't want to lighten up in their policy and really wanted
to solve the refugee exodus in one way: namely closing the
border.''
	   The conflict continued into the 1960s.
	   ``(In) a speech (Ulbricht) was giving to the Warsaw Pact in
March of 1961 ... he asked to build the wall and was told (by
Khrushchev) 'Wait until I meet with Kennedy in June,' and after
that Khrushchev gave the go-ahead,'' she said.
	   Khrushchev told Kennedy at their Vienna summit that West Berlin
should be turned into a demilitarized ``free city'' on the
territory of East Germany, which surrounded it.
	   The following month, 30,415 refugees registered in West Berlin,
many of them fleeing by foot and subway from East Berlin. Losing so
many capable people threatened the economy of Ulbricht's ``German
Democratic Republic.''
	   Khrushchev finally saw no other way out for East Germany, which
he considered a showcase for communism and capable of surpassing
the booming economy of West Germany.
	   Until Aug. 13, 1961, when East German police began stringing
barbed wire on the western side of the Brandenburg Gate, the border
between East and West Berlin was virtually open. After the wall
went up, it was 28 years until the barriers were torn down,
allowing Germany to reunite in 1990.
	   David Murphy, CIA chief in Berlin at the time, said it's now
apparent that the ``East German tail wagged the Soviet dog much
more than the west realized.''
	   Murphy said the CIA warned President Dwight Eisenhower more than
a year before the wall went up that the Communists would have to do
something drastic about the refugees.
	   ``In May 1960 we pulled together reports snd the experience of
our officers and did a memorandum for U.S. delegates to the Paris
conference,'' he said.
	   ``I took it to Paris because I was assigned to the delegation as
a consultant. We predicted that the Soviets or the East Germans
would have to change the modalities of movement through the sector
border (in Berlin). They could not continue to allow a flow of this
magnitude without serious security problems.''
	   The Paris conference broke up when Eisenhower would not make a
formal apology to Khrushchev for Gary Powers' U-2 espionage flight,
shot down over the Soviet Union.
	   Ulbricht took a much riskier line than Khrushchev on relations
with the United States, which had troops in Berlin. After the wall
went up there was a tense stand-off at an international
crossing-point _ Checkpoint Charlie. Tanks rolled in to face the
lined-up American armor.
	   But not a shot was fired and eventually both sides pulled back.
	   Later Gen. Lucius Clay, President John F. Kennedy's sprecial
representative, told an Associated Press correspondent in an
interview during the crisis:
	   ``It was the greatest relief in my life when I found they were
Russian tanks, not East German tanks.''
	   It was off the record at the time. Clay died in 1978.
	   Ms. Harrison found Ulbricht's letter to Khrushchev on the Berlin
crisis in the party archives. ``I must say the adversary undertook
fewer counter-measures than were expected,'' Ulbricht wrote.
	   Khrushchev asked Ulbricht not to do anything to make the Berlin
situation worse, because of impending negotiations with the West.
	   Khrushchev was ousted in 1964 and died in 1971. Ulbricht died in
1973.
	   ___
	   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Carl Hartman, a reporter in Washington, was AP
correspondent in Berlin from 1959 thru 1961. He is the reporter who
interviewed Gen. Lucius Clay during the crisis over the wall.

China's gymnasts take all-around golds at Asian Games

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with China winning women's all-around &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China swept the men's and women's
all-around gymnastics golds Wednesday at the Asian Games,
maintaining its unblemished record as controversy erupted over
North Korea's team of diminutive women gymnasts.
	   Concerned that the North's gymnasts might be under the minimum
age of 16, organizers gave the team until the end of the day to
produce their passports. Officials, as well as coaches and doctors
from rival teams, had questioned the girls' ages after seeing them
in competition Tuesday.
	   ``We are going to investigate,'' said Wei Jizhong, chairman of
the Olympic Committee of Asia's standing committee. ``If you want
to check, you have to check their passports, there's no other
way.''
	   In the women's all-around, China's Liu Xuan scored a massive
38.787 to leave the other gymnasts battling for silver and bronze.
The 19-year-old veteran's commanding performance rescued what was
otherwise an off-form day for China's women, with Liu's younger
teammates both making mistakes that put them out of medal
contention.
	   Kazakstan's Irina Yevdokimova got silver, earning her a bear hug
from her coach. She edged out Japan's Risa Sugawara, who took
bronze.
	   Yevdokimova's score was 37.912 to Sugawara's 37.300.
	   In the men's competition, Chinese veteran Huang Xu and newcomer
Yang Wei took gold and silver, complementing the team golds taken
by China's men and women earlier in the week.
	   ``I'm very pleased,'' said Huang. ``All of us could have taken
gold, it just depended who did best on the day.''
	   Yang, an 18-year-old newcomer in his first major competition
said the silver would give him ``a lot more confidence'' heading
into next year's World Championships and the Olympics in 2000.
	   Bronze went to Naoya Tsukahara of Japan, the son of five-time
Olympic gold medalist Mitsuo Tsukahara.
	   ``So-so,'' said the elder Tsukahara when asked to evaluate his
son's performance. ``He wanted gold.''
	   Huang, 19, is a veteran of China's 1997 World Championship team.
He was all muscular control on the rings, barely wobbling as he
completed an impressive routine that scored 9.7. He also was
consistently good throughout the five other disciplines and went
into his final event, the pommel horse, trailing his teammate Yang
by just 0.025.
	   He clinched gold with a nearly flawless display that scored
9.725, his highest mark of the day, for a final score of 57.825.
	   Yang had 57.600 and Tsukahara 57.375.
	   China was looking for more gold Thursday in the appartus finals,
although it will be hard pressed to match its feat at the last
Asian Games in 1994, when the Chinese took all but one of the 14
golds.
	   Organizers decided to examine the North Koreans' passports after
an official from the Asian Gymnastics Union queried the age of
their women.
	   ``She said I think we better check because their faces look very
young. They don't look 16,'' said Suebsai Boonveerabut, the
competition organizer.
	   But the meeting with the North Koreans shortly after Huang took
gold proved inconclusive because the women's passports were with
another North Korean official who had gone to the airport to meet
someone, she said.
	   The North Koreans were told to produce the passports by
midnight, and the women were allowed to carry on competing, but
their results would be voided if they were later found to be
underage, she said.
	   Halfway through the competition, Thailand's Saran Suwansa was
taken off on a stretcher, clutching his head in pain, after he
landed heavily on a failed vault. He failed to complete a final
twist on a somersault off the vault and appeared to wrench his knee
as he landed awkwardly. He was hospitalized briefly with a
dislocated knee joint, and was unlikely to continue in the
competition, said Valerie McKenzie, a spokeswoman for the
organizing committee.
	   In the women's contest, a gymnast from Uzbekistan, A. Gordeeva,
also was injured on the floor and was led away clutching her elbow,
fighting back tears.

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Despite U.S. appeals to stop
violence, Palestinians pressing for the release of prisoners held
by Israel stoned Israeli troops and motorists throughout the West
Bank on Wednesday in the most widespread clashes in months.
	   Soldiers fired mainly rubber bullets and tear gas, but also
several live rounds, and at least 71 Palestinians and two Israelis
were hurt. Four of the injured were hit by live bullets.
	   A wall of dense black smoke rose near the West Bank town of
Ramallah as Palestinians burned tires, blocking a main road.
Rioters, some masked with checkered scarves covering their faces,
hurled stones from slingshots at Israeli troops in riot gear.
	   ``We cannot let our brothers remain in jail,'' said a
20-year-old stone thrower, who gave only his last name, Jariri. He
grimaced in pain when a paramedic at the scene bandaged his right
hand and wrist after he was struck by a rubber-coated steel pellet.
	   Israel accused Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat of organizing
the violence, which erupted just four days before the start of U.S.
President Bill Clinton's visit to Israel and the Palestinian areas.
	   In a defiant speech to loyalists from his Fatah group, Arafat
praised the prisoners, many of whom are serving lengthy sentences
for attacking Israelis, as ``our heroes.''
	   The dispute over the prisoners is one of the points of
contention between Israel and the Palestinians.
	   Last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suspended
the upcoming Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank amid
complaints that the Palestinian Authority was inciting against
Israel over the prisoner issue.
	   The Palestinians countered that Netanyahu was holding up the
agreement because he wanted to appease hard-line legislators and
prevent the fall of his crumbling coalition.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has demanded that
both sides stick to the terms of the Wye River peace agreement
Clinton helped negotiate in October.
	   ``I have been in touch with both sides in the last few days,
making clear that it's important for the Palestinians to live up to
their obligations in terms of taking care of the security situation
and following through on what they are obligated to do, and also,
with the Israelis, not to add conditions,'' Albright said.
	   The U.S. Mideast peace envoy, Dennis Ross, met Tuesday with
Netanyahu and Arafat to try and get the accord back on track ahead
of the Clinton visit which was intended to shore up the Wye
agreement, but appeared to be having the opposite effect.
	   In his meeting with Ross on Tuesday evening, Arafat complained
that Israel is violating the Wye agreement by continuing to expand
Jewish settlements and by refusing to release security prisoners.
	   Under the accord, Israel is to release 750 prisoners by the end
of January. It freed 250 in a first stage last month, but most of
them were common criminals. Arafat said he had been made to believe
that all those freed were to be security prisoners, a claim
Netanyahu has denied.
	   Arafat said Wednesday he would not drop the matter. ``We tell
our heroes, the prisoners, that we will not close our eyes until we
see them in front of us,'' Arafat told Fatah activists.
	   Netanyahu, meanwhile, delivered his own list of complaints to
Ross and said Israel would not pull back troops in the West Bank as
long as the Palestinians kept violating the agreement.
	   ``We are not going to transfer any more territory unless the
Palestinians live up to their commitments,'' said Netanyahu's
senior adviser, David Bar-Illan.
	   Bar-Illan charged that Wednesday's clashes were organized by the
Palestinian Authority, and not a spontaneous eruption of anger, as
the Palestinians have portrayed it.
	   Wednesday's clashes _ violence also erupted outside the towns of
Bethlehem, Jenin, Jerusalem and several camps and villages _
coincided with the 11th anniversary of the outbreak of the
1987-1993 Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation. Shops
were closed in the West Bank and traditionally Arab east Jerusalem
to commemorate the anniversary and show support for the prisoners.
	   Palestinian paramedics said 67 protesters were injured by rubber
bullets and four by live rounds. Two of the injured were in serious
condition. Two Israelis were lightly injured by stones.

EU chief sees no respite for European duty free
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Commission President Jacques
Santer said Wednesday chances of rescuing tax-free sales for travel
within the European Union were just about nil.
	   He added that he failed to see why Britain was so keen to
continue with duty free sales since tax-free shops at airports and
other points were no bargain.
	   ``I don't know about you, but often duty-free shop prices are no
lower than in regular stores,'' Santer told a press conference.
	   At a EU foreign ministers meeting here this week Britain failed
to gain sufficient support to overturn a 1991 decision to end
duty-free shopping for travel within the Union by mid-1999.
	   That was a unanimous decision of all EU governments reflecting
the view that in a borderless EU there can be room for tax-free
sales at national frontiers.
	   Britain has pledged to pursue its campaign to maintain duty-free
sales within the EU at a two-day European summit opening Friday in
Vienna.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook this week said the
scheduled abolition of tax free sales was for many British people
``the most visible and high-profile impact of any decision by the
European Union.''
	   Britain's bid to extend the life of the popular tax-free sales
on flights, ports and ferry crossings is backed by France, Germany,
Ireland, Spain and Luxembourg. But only a unanimous vote by all 15
EU nations can save duty-free.
	   Denmark, the Netherlands, Portugal, Italy, Finland and Sweden
favor the ban.
	   The duty-free sector has in recent years mounted an intense
lobbying campaign arguing that scrapping the dlrs
6.4-billion-a-year industry will push up the cost of travel and
make 150,000 people jobless.
	   The EU Commission argues that duty-free operators effectively
enjoy a subsidy of dlrs 2.2 billion a year by not paying duties on
their sales, giving them an unfair advantage over other retailers.
	   The ban only affects sales for travelers within the EU. Those
traveling to or from the Union will still be able to enjoy tax free
shopping.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Riot police clashed with about 200
students near President B.J. Habibie's house Wednesday hours after
state prosecutors questioned ex-President Suharto over allegations
of massive corruption.
	   Police said 31 students were arrested outside the headquarters
of a charitable foundation formerly controlled by Suharto.
	   Some of the students, who want Suharto put on trial, threw rocks
at officers, witnesses said.
	   The building is about 500 meters (yards) away from Habibie's
home, which was heavily guarded.
	   Privately-owned Anteve television said 17 students were injured.
	   Another group of students were blocked by police on a toll road
when they tried to march on Habibie's home about one kilometer (a
half mile) away in south Jakarta.
	   At least five other demonstrations were staged in various spots
in the capital, which was under a tight security clampdown because
of Suharto's questioning.
	   Demonstrations were also held in other cities.
	   The biggest protest on Wednesday was held was outside the
Jakarta police headquarters, where more than 1,000 students
demanded the release of two fellow activists in detention.
	   The two were arrested on Tuesday and have been accused of
briefly abducting of a plainclothes police officer last month.
	   The protesters tore down a fence near the headquarters' main
gate.
	   ``Release our fellow students,'' chanted the protesters.
	   They also unfurled banners demanding the Suharto's trial and the
dissolution of Parliament.
	   Several hundred students took shelter in the nearby Ministry of
Health building after they were chased down a major road by
baton-wielding riot squads.
	   In the second city of Surabaya, hundreds of students from the
state-run Airlangga university demonstrated in front of a
prosecutor's office demanding Suharto be thoroughly investigated.
	   Similar protests was also held in Bandung, the West Java capital
and Bogor, just south of Jakarta.

Turkish premier-designate fighting losing battle for secular
</HEADLINE>
coalition &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The chances for a new, strictly secular
government in Turkey faded Wednesday when a potential coalition
partner insisted on giving the Islamic party a share of power.
	   The military, self-appointed guardians of Turkey's secular
system, is adamantly opposed to the inclusion of Islamic Virtue,
the largest party in parliament.
	   Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit needs Turkey's two-center right
parties to hammer together a secular coalition, but Tansu Ciller,
the ex-premier who commands 99 votes in parliament, rebuffed him
Wednesday.
	   Ecevit already has the support of her arch-rival, outgoing
Premier Mesut Yilmaz, head of the other center-right party.
	   But Mrs. Ciller said Wednesday she would not join forces with
Yilmaz, whose government collapsed Nov. 25 over a mafia scandal.
Instead, she reiterated her demand for a government that would
include Virtue.
	   ``We do not oppose Mr. Ecevit's premiership. We will support
him, but only if all parties represented in Parliament are
included,'' Mrs. Ciller said.
	   It was not clear what Ecevit's next move would be. He might try
to form a fragile minority coalition. He might also admit defeat
and return the task of forming the government to President Suleyman
Demirel.
	   Demirel himself could head an interim government until elections
in April.

Chechen leader hostages killed while rescue was in works

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechen authorities were trying to rescue
four foreign hostages when the kidnappers panicked and beheaded the
victims, Chechnya's president said Wednesday.
	   Aslan Maskhadov, the leader of the breakaway republic, said that
one alleged kidnapper was arrested, and authorities then planned an
operation to free the four hostages, three Britons and a New
Zealander, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   ``A concrete criminal group was identified, an organizer of the
abductions was arrested and an approximate location of the hostages
was determined,'' Maskhadov said in a statement.
	   ``The criminals brutally executed the hostages while an
operation for their release was under way,'' he said.
	   The severed heads of the four men were found along a highway
Tuesday outside Chechnya's capital Grozny, and hundreds of Chechen
law enforcement officers were searching for the bodies on
Wednesday.
	   ``We will take all necessary steps to solve this horrible
crime,'' said Maskhadov, who has been unable to restore
law-and-order in Chechnya since being elected last year.
	   The victims _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf
Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were identified by their
former bodyguard. They had been abducted by unidentified gunmen
Oct. 3 in Grozny.
	   The men were working to restore phone services in Chechnya,
which was devastated during the 1994-6 war with Russia.
	   Chechnya now runs its own affairs, but is plagued by kidnappings
for ransom. Most hostages have been released, though dozens remain
in captivity.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook met his Russian counterpart
Igor Ivanov on Wednesday in Belgium and said, ``neither the Russian
foreign minister nor I underestimate the difficulty of making
progress in the lawless state in Chechnya.''
	   ``The Russian government throughout has sought to be as helpful
as it can within its power, but that power is very limited in
Chechnya,'' Cook added.
	   Ray Verth, chief executive of Granger Telecom, the British
company the hostages had worked for, said the deaths were
apparently the result of a rescue attempt by Chechen authorities
that went ``tragically wrong.''
	   An Associated Press reporter saw the decapitated heads Tuesday
near the village of Assinovskaya, about 40 kilometers (25 miles)
west of Grozny.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin expressed outrage at the
killings and urged law enforcement officials to crack down on
kidnappings.
	   This year, 176 people have been kidnapped in Chechnya and
surrounding regions in southern Russia, and 90 of them have been
released, officials have said.

Russian parliament forms commission to investigate lawmaker's
</HEADLINE>
murder &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's parliament agreed Wednesday to form a
commission to investigate the murder of a prominent liberal
lawmaker gunned down last month in an apparent contract hit.
	   Galina Starovoitova was shot dead by unidentified assailants in
her apartment building in St. Petersburg on Nov. 20.
	   She was one of the most prominent victims of violence in
post-Soviet Russia, and her death has rallied liberal forces in the
country and prompted numerous calls to crack down on lawlessness
and violence.
	   The State Duma, or lower house of parliament, voted 277-1 to
form the commission. The task force will be headed by Communist
lawmaker Valery Vorotnikov and is to include representatives of all
parliamentary factions.
	   A resolution released by the Duma said the commission would help
police ``in collecting, analyzing and summarizing the information''
connected to the murder.
	   Police have announced no breakthroughs in the investigation of
Starovoitova's slaying, and contract killings are rarely solved in
Russia.
	   Investigators were also skeptical of the Duma's efforts.
	   ``I don't think that (the commission) will make any
difference,'' Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov told reporters.
``Regardless of what commissions are formed, we are working by
ourselves. So we are calm about this.''
	   The commission was to report to parliament Jan. 20 on its
findings.

Russian parliament forms commission to investigate lawmaker's
</HEADLINE>
murder &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's parliament agreed Wednesday to form a
commission to investigate the murder of a prominent liberal
lawmaker gunned down last month in an apparent contract hit.
	   Galina Starovoitova was shot dead by unidentified assailants in
her apartment building in St. Petersburg on Nov. 20.
	   She was one of the most prominent victims of violence in
post-Soviet Russia, and her death has rallied liberal forces in the
country and prompted numerous calls to crack down on lawlessness
and violence.
	   The State Duma, or lower house of parliament, voted 277-1 to
form the commission. The task force will be headed by Communist
lawmaker Valery Vorotnikov and is to include representatives of all
parliamentary factions.
	   A resolution released by the Duma said the commission would help
police ``in collecting, analyzing and summarizing the information''
connected to the murder.
	   Police have announced no breakthroughs in the investigation of
Starovoitova's slaying, and contract killings are rarely solved in
Russia.
	   Investigators were also skeptical of the Duma's efforts.
	   ``I don't think that (the commission) will make any
difference,'' Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov told reporters.
``Regardless of what commissions are formed, we are working by
ourselves. So we are calm about this.''
	   The commission was to report to parliament Jan. 20 on its
findings.

South Korea nears quarterfinals; Japan rallies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout to clarify that South Korean quarterfinal
berth not clinched &QL; 
 &UR; By PATRICK MCDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Japan rallied from a goal down with two
late scores to beat Kuwait 2-1 Wednesday and keep alive its chances
of reaching the quarterfinals of the Asian Games soccer tournament.
	   Earlier, South Korea neared a quarterfinal berth with a tight
2-1 victory over United Arab Emirates, although star striker Choi
Yong-soo was held scoreless.
	   With two victories in Group 2, South Korea might not need to win
its final group game to make the final eight. The UAE is winless in
two matches in the second round. Japan and South Korea are each
1-1, with Kuwait facing South Korea next.
	   Uzbekistan beat India 2-0 for its second victory, clinching a
quarterfinal position from Group 1.
	   In the group's other match, Turkmenistan and North Korea battled
to a 1-1 draw. Turkmenistan has a victory and a draw. North Korea
is hanging on with a loss and a draw.
	   Japan, South Korea's co-host for the 2002 World Cup, was under
intense pressure not to lose to Kuwait, a favorite to win the Asian
Games gold. Japan lost to South Korea on Monday.
	   After a scoreless first half, the young, quick Japanese came out
attacking. But the more experienced Kuwaitis, with greater flair,
also continued to threaten, coming in close twice for shots that
went wide or over the crossbar.
	   The first goal came in the 78th minute, with Iran's Farj Laheeb
connecting from short range on a pass from Hani al-Saqer. That tied
him with teammate Jasem al-Huwaidi at the top of the games' scoring
table with eight apiece.
	   But it was little consolation when Japan's Yoshiteru Yamashita
equalized off a header with about 10 minutes left, splitting
between two defenders just above the penalty spot after a long
crossing pass.
	   Kuwait defender Husan Al-Khodari then opened the door to
disaster for his side by climbing over the back of Japan's Nozomi
Hiroyama in front of the goal and drawing a penalty.
	   Shunsuke Nakamura drilled the net to bring Japan ahead 2-1.
	   Japan's French coach, Philippe Troussier, said he could ``dream
again'' after what he admitted was an unexpected victory.
	   ``On paper we were not the favorites of this game,'' Troussier
said. ``For this reason I asked the players to play this game with
a free mind.''
	   Troussier acknowledged that the Kuwait side was more powerful
and experienced and said his players showed determination ``to the
last minute''.
	   ``We scored two goals in five minutes at the end of this match.
The pressure is off our shoulders today.''
	   Japanese fans were mostly subdued during most of the game, then
came alive with the first goal.
	   Meanwhile, the drum-pounding, flag-waving South Korean fans were
ecstatic at their team's victory.
	   Later, they cheered archrival Japan, which South Korea beat 2-0
on Monday.
	   ``I'd like to see Japan win and then meet them again in the
final,'' said South Korean travel agent Peter Jin, 30.
	   ``We could beat them again. It's a good rivalry.''
	   South Korea found a tougher opponent than it expected in the
United Arab Emirates. Both sides played tight defense, with the
Koreans looking to clinch a quarterfinal berth and the UAE
struggling to survive after a 5-0 loss in the group opener Monday
to Kuwait.
	   Korean attacker Choi, trailing the Kuwaiti duo in the games'
goals chart with six, was held to a pair of hopeless long shots.
	   But sustained pressure on the UAE opened up a quick drive in the
38th minute. Park Jin-sup's feints allowed a deep penetration
before he lofted a long pass back to midfield.
	   Yoon Jong-hwan met it and his shot from 25 meters blew past
Emirates keeper Rashed Yousif Humadi, who barely had time to move.
The goal was Yoon's second of the games.
	   Sultanrashed Kalbani tried to equalize a minute later but Korean
Kim Byung-ji stretched a couple of fingers on the ball to push it
to the near post and away.
	   A dangerous tackle by Ali Saleed Rashid eight minutes into the
second half gave South Korea a chance to add insurance. Midfielder
Yoo Sang-chul scored from the penalty spot, making it 2-0.
	   The Emirates quickly replied. A controlled pitch-hugging pass by
Kazim Ali Abdulla set up teammate Mohammed Ibrahim Alboloshi, whose
goal made it 2-1.
	   South Korean coach Hun Jung-moo said he will field his second
string against Kuwait.
	   ``Already we have entered the quarterfinals so we will let the
others who haven't played in the next game. I don't care about the
next match,'' he said.
	   He was a bit concerned about the scoreless Choi.
	   ``I hope he will score in the next game he plays,'' Hun said.
	   The Turkmenistan-North Korea encounter was scoreless for the
first half.
	   Ri Chang Gyu opened the scoring in the 70th minute.
Turkmenistan's Roman Bondarenko evened it with a minute left in
regulation time.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A U.N. weapons inspection team turned back
Wednesday after it was refused admission to an office of the ruling
Baath party in Baghdad, state-run Iraqi radio said.
	   It was the first time a U.N. team was blocked from conducting a
search for banned weapons since Richard Butler, head of the U.N.
Special Commission that oversees the inspectors, announced earlier
this week that ``surprise'' inspections would resume on Tuesday.
	   Last month, a team was not allowed into a base run by Iranian
exiles, the Mujahedeen Khalq.
	   Iraqi radio said a U.N. weapons team at about 9 a.m. (0600 gmt)
tried to get into a headquarters of the party of Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein ``in a provocative manner ... without previous
announcement.''
	   The broadcast, which quoted the official Iraqi News Agency, said
the Baath party official in charge of the headquarters demanded
that the head of the U.N. team give him a written declaration ``on
the banned items'' the team was seeking.
	   ``The team rejected this and withdrew,'' the agency said.
	   The exact location of the Baath Party office involved in
Wednesday's incident was not immediately known.
	   The exact location of the Baath Party office involved in

	   The U.N. Special Commission operations room here said
spokeswoman Caroline Cross had left word that she could not take

	   The incident occurred as nearly 200 U.N. inspectors searched for
banned weapons in Iraq.

were working Wednesday.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The discovery of a complete
3.6 million-year-old hominid skeleton near Johannesburg is expected
to shed light on whether human ancestors ever lived in trees,
researchers at the University of Witwatersrand said Wednesday.
	   ``It's one of many missing links from ape to man,'' said Ron
Clarke, a palaeo-anthropologist at the university who made the
find. With the skeleton, ``We're getting closer to the ape end'' of
man's evolution.
	   The skull, limbs and torso _ much of them still imbedded in rock
_ belong to fossilized foot and ankle bones discovered in 1994 by
Clarke.
	   Clarke and his University of Witwatersrand colleague Philip
Tobias contend that a large articulated big toe on the original
find implied that humans, as they evolved from apes, both walked
upright like men and climbed trees like monkeys.
	   Paleontologists for years have debated whether human ancestors
ever lived in trees. Some say man evolved from a plains-dwelling
species that walked upright.
	   Once the bones are pried from iron-hard rock _ a process
expected to take another year _ they can be examined to see if the
hip and leg structures bear out the tree-climbing theory.
	   The discovery, documented Wednesday in the South African Journal
of Science, was to be reported in the magazine Nature in London on
Thursday, researchers said at a news conference.
	   In a telephone interview from London, a top expert on human
origins said the finding of a complete skeleton is rare in the
study of early man.
	   ``It's wonderfully preserved ... and potentially very important,
but until it's really out of the ground, it's difficult to assess
how important,'' said Chris Stringer, head of the human origins
research group at the Natural History Museum in London.
	   The skeleton was discovered underground at Sterkfontein, a
former lime quarry cave that has yielded a number of hominid skulls
since the 1930s.
	   Clarke and Tobias said it appeared the Australopithecus
africanus, as it is known scientifically, fell down a 15-meter
(45-foot) shaft. The creature lived in a wooded area and was
capable of climbing trees, Clarke said.
	   Scientists determined the creature's date of origin by examining
the rock.
	   The shaft later filled with limestone, which has been mined
since the 19th century at the site.
	   Clarke and his team said they uncovered more bones belonging to
the 1995 skeleton while rummaging through animal bones at a
university cupboard in 1997. The find sent them back to
Sterkfontein to search for the rest of the skeleton.
	   The find of a complete australopithecus skeleton will help
researchers fill the gaps in other discoveries, Clarke said.
	   Previously, the most complete early hominid was ``Lucy,'' an
Australopithecus whose partial skeleton was discovered in 1974 in
Ethiopia. The oldest complete skeleton before this latest discovery
dates back to 1.8 million years, Clarke said. It was that of a Homo
Erectus, found in Kenya.
	   This is ``probably the most momentous find ever made in
Africa,'' said Tobias, professor emeritus of the Witwatersrand
anatomy department, who has been involved in string of finds.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Rioters smashed store windows and burned
cars during a rally Wednesday by teachers and students against
education reforms.
	   Christmas shoppers ran for cover as hooligans tailing the rally
hurled rocks and gasoline bombs at stores and riot police. There
were no reports of serious injuries. At least 11 people were
detained by police.
	   The anarchist youths, who routinely disrupt otherwise peaceful
demonstrations, targeted banks, fast food restaurants and private
cars during running battles with police. One masked arsonist threw
a gasoline bomb into a McDonald's restaurant facing parliament.
	   The march by students and striking teachers stepped up a
widespread protest against the government-imposed reforms.
	   Joined by university students, an estimated 10,000 demonstrators
rallied in Athens, chanting slogans against Education Minister
Gerasimos Arsenis. They demanded the immediate repeal of the
reforms to shake up the course and marking systems at state schools
and universities.
	   Rallies were also held in dozens towns around Greece.
	   The mounting opposition has created another serious headache for
the government of Premier Costas Simitis, which is struggling to
push through austerity measures demanded by the European Union.
	   Students also have blocked busy roads and occupied hundreds of
high school buildings in a growing two-week campaign.
	   Arsenis has charged that protesting children were being
``deliberately misinformed'' about the reforms by teachers and
private night schools which most Greek children attend to keep up
with classes.
	   ``People must understand that if we want to be equal partners in
Europe, children must get a proper education at schools,'' Arsenis
said after meeting with Simitis.
	   Greek education receives little public funding. Teachers have
for years been campaigning for better pay and work conditions. They
argue that schools are too poorly equipped for the reforms to work.
	   The waves of strikes and protests apparently reflect eroding
support for the Simitis government, according to a nationwide poll
published Wednesday.
	   The Socialists fell 6.5 percentage points behind the main
opposition New Democracy conservative party. There was no margin of
error.
	   Respondents said they believed the state of education is one of
Greece's most serious problems.

EDITING throughout. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan passengers rioted aboard a chartered
Egyptian airliner and demanded that the plane fly to Libya in
violation of U.N. sanctions, police said. But the pilot tricked
them and landed in neighboring Tunisia.
	   A melee developed aboard the plane, an MD-9O, after take-off
from San`a, the capital of Yemen, en route to Tunis, Tunisia,
police officials said.
	   Airport officials in Cairo said the hijacking incident began
with two masked passengers entering the cockpit and demanding to go
to the Libyan capital Tripoli. Then, they said, a large group of
other passengers joining in the demand.
	   Both the Egyptian police and Cairo airport officials spoke on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   None of the passengers or crew was reported injured, and it was
unclear if the men who entered the cockpit had weapons or if the
Libyan passengers took over the plane by force of numbers.
	   The plane landed in Jerba, a Tunisian island about 80 kilometers
(50 miles) from Libya's northwest border, an airport official in
Jerba said, insisting his name not be used.
	   The pilot contacted Egypt by radio and reported a large number
of Libyan passengers were causing a melee and demanding to go to
Tripoli in violation of a U.N. ban on international flights to the
country, an Egyptian police official said.
	   About 150 Libyans were aboard the aircraft, which was chartered
by a private Egyptian company for a flight by Libyan businessmen, a
Cairo airport official said.
	   Police said that the aircraft itself belongs to EgyptAir, the
national carrier, and that Tunisian and Yemeni passengers also were
aboard.
	   Libya has frequently violated the U.N. flight ban, which was
adopted in 1992 to force Libya to turn over two suspects wanted for
the bombing of an Pan Am jet over Scotland in 1988.
	   The police official said the pilot was told by Egyptian
authorities that he could fly to Libya under duress without
violating sanctions, but the pilot apparently tricked the hijackers
and landed in Jerba.
	   The Libyan passengers initially refused to leave the plane and
later apparently holed up in the airport and refused to speak to
authorities, the police official said.
	   Jerba, an island 350 kilometers (210 miles) south of the capital
Tunis, is frequently used as a transit point for travelers going on
to Libya by land without violating the sanctions.

Japanese banks lend less as economy falters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Lending by Japanese banks fell by the biggest
amount ever in November, a sign that the credit crunch weighing on
Japanese companies may be worsening.
	   Outstanding loans by Japanese banks plunged a record 4.0 percent
in November from a year earlier, after a 3.4 percent fall in
October, the Bank of Japan said Wednesday.
	   Japanese banks _ already holding huge amounts of bad debt _ have
been reluctant to make new loans. At the same time, fewer companies
are asking for funds as they struggle through the worst recession
in Japan's postwar history.
	   ``There's weakness in demand for credit and ongoing reluctance
by banks to lend,'' said Cameron Umetsu, senior strategist at
Warburg Dillon Read in Tokyo.
	   Also contributing to the big drop in lending were moves by many
banks to write off some of their bad loans, the central bank said.
	   A mountain of bad loans left from the collapse of real estate
prices early this decade has threatened the health of Japan's
financial system, and banks are struggling to rid themselves of the
bad loans.
	   Adjusted for those writeoffs, overall lending would have dropped
1.2 percent compared to a fall of 1.4 percent in October.
	   The government worries that the banks' problems are making it
difficult for even healthy companies to find funding.
	   To encourage banks to lend more the government passed into law
in October a 60 trillion yen (dlrs 508 billion) plan to strengthen
the financial system. The plan allows the government to inject
public funds into weak banks.

Official: Kidnappers beheaded hostages because they feared capture
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RUSLAN MUSAYEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechen kidnappers beheaded four foreign
hostages because they feared capture and wanted to prevent their
victims from serving as witnesses, an official in the breakaway
territory said today.
	   One suspected kidnapper was arrested Sunday, and his detention
triggered panic among the rest, Chechnya's Prosecutor General
Mansur Tagirov told the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The kidnappers then killed the three Britons and the New
Zealander, whose severed heads were found Tuesday along a highway
in Chechnya.
	   Hundreds of Chechen law enforcement officers were searching for
the bodies today, officials said.
	   Tagirov said authorities believe they know the names of those
involved in the kidnappings, but he did not release additional
details.
	   The victims _ Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey and Rudolf Petschi of
Britain and Stanley Shaw of New Zealand _ were identified by their
former bodyguard. They were abducted Oct. 3 by unidentified gunmen
in Grozny, Chechnya's capital.
	   The men were working to restore phone services in Chechnya,
which was devastated during the 1994-96 war with Russia.
	   Chechnya now runs its own affairs, but it is plagued by
kidnappings for ransom. This year, 176 people have been kidnapped
in Chechnya and surrounding regions in southern Russia, and 90 of
them have been released, officials have said.
	   Ray Verth, chief executive of Granger Telecom, the British
company the hostages had worked for, said the deaths apparently
were the result of a rescue attempt by Chechen authorities Monday
that went ``tragically wrong.''
	   An Associated Press reporter saw the decapitated heads Tuesday
near the village of Assinovskaya, about 25 miles west of Grozny,
the Chechen capital. He did not see any sign of the bodies.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin expressed outrage at the
killings and urged law enforcement officials to crack down on
kidnapping, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin told reporters.
	   However, the Russian government has no authority in Chechnya,
and ethnic Russian citizens are among those who have been
kidnapped.

Real Sociedad fan stabbed to death in UEFA match against Atletico
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A 28-year-old Real Sociedad supporter died
early Wednesday from stab wounds allegedly inflicted by a rival fan
from Atletico Madrid hours before the teams faced each other in a
UEFA Cup match.
	   The stabbing of Aitor Zabaleta outside Atletico's Vicente
Calderon stadium three hours before Tuesday night's match,
overshadowed the home team's 4-1 win in extra time over Real
Sociedad.
	   ``It was savagery. An atrocity,'' said Luis Uranga, president of
the Real Sociedad.
	   There were no immediate details about the cause of stabbing,
although authorities said that Zabaleta and his girlfriend were in
a bar near the stadium when they were harassed by a group of
radical rival fans known as the Atletico Front.
	   Zabaleta was allegedly stabbed in the chest about 400 meters
(yards) from the stadium by one of the group that followed the
couple when they left the bar.
	   The stabbed fan was rushed to a Madrid hospital, where he
underwent emergency heart surgery but died at 3:00 a.m (0200GMT).
Police on Wednesday had yet to arrest anybody in connection with
the murder.
	   Witnesses said the attackers, who fled, were wearing the
distinctive red and white scarves of Atletico Madrid.
	   Atletico's chairman Jesus Gil sought to distance his club from
the killing. ``It was the stab of a mad person who does not
represent the fans of Atletico.'' he said.
	   The killing of Zabaleta was also condemned by players, league
officials and politicians from the northern Basque country where
Real Sociedad is from.

Twins 1-2 at Asian Games, former drug offender takes gold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES at end of session &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Shunsuke Ito came into the world before
identical twin brother Shusuke and was in front of him again
Wednesday as they scored a 1-2 finish in the 100-meter freestyle
final at the Asian Games.
	   The 22-year-olds, from Okayama, helped the Japanese maintain
their lead over rival China in the swimming medals table after they
were crushed four years ago in Hiroshima. One of the seven swimmers
who received a two-year ban after those games for using steroids,
Fu Yong, made a winning comeback Wednesday in the men's 200-meter
freestyle.
	   China won three of the five golds Wednesday, with Japan taking
the other two to lead 8-6 after 15 events.
	   ``Our parents are here in Bangkok and it's great for us to be
able to show our thanks for them supporting us both,'' said Shusuke
after finishing second behind his brother.
	   The pair have different styles, with Shunsuke a fast starter and
Shusuke a strong finisher, and the elder brother's approach won out
as usual in races between the pair.
	   ``I'm just really happy to have a 1-2 with my brother,'' the
winning brother said. They are good friends as well as strong
competitors and discussed their tactics before the race.
	   ``I finished and I looked around for my brother and I could see
in his eyes that we did it,'' Shunsuke said. They both won a gold
medal in Tuesday's freestyle relay.
	   Fu Yong, a bronze medalist in 1994, was too strong for
Malaysia's Keng-Liat Lim and Raymond Papa of the Philippines in the
200-meter backstroke.
	   Another former drug offender, Xiong Guoming, won a silver
Tuesday.
	   China's Chen Hau made the most of the absence of world champion
Chen Yan by winning the women's 400-meter freestyle.
	   Chen Yan, who won the event along with the 400-meter medley at
this year's world championships in Perth, remains ill with a
stomach ailment, according to team officials. The medley world
record holder trailed off badly to finish third in that event
Monday and missed Tuesday's 200 freestyle because of diarrhea.
	   Chen also failed to show up for the heats of the 400 freestyle
Wednesday. She would have been the clear favorite.
	   After 15 events of 32, the only outsider to break into the
Japan-China pool party was Taiwan's Tsai Shu-min in the women's 200
freestyle Tuesday. Tsai was third in the 400 freestyle Wednesday
with Japan's Sachiko Yamada in second.
	   Shunsuke Ito clocked 51.29 to win the freestyle, a time that
barely put him into the world's top 100 for the year. Shusuke
stayed off the rankings list with his 52.07.
	   Japan's Tomoko Hagiwara was first in the women's 100 backstroke,
beating compatriot Mai Nakamura and South Korea's Choi Soo-min in a
race without any Chinese entrant.
	   China finished off a night of recovery following Tuesday's
five-event losing streak with victory in the 4x100 freestyle relay.

ABU DHABI: countries hard.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Jamil al-Hojeilan, the secretary-general of the Gulf Cooperation
Council, said Tuesday that overproduction by oil-rich nations was
to blame for the price slump.
	   Al-Hojeilan told the Middle East Broadcasting Corp., an Arabic
TV network, that ``the whole problem'' was caused by countries not
sticking to their production quotas.
	   Analysts say Venezuela, Iran, Indonesia and Qatar are the main
over-producers.
	   ``The strategic view of oil policy in the GCC countries is to
keep a balance between supply and demand. We hope that pledges of
abiding by quotas agreed upon are respected,'' al-Hojeilan said.
	   Early Wednesday, Gulf officials were saying that the national
leaders and oil ministers had decided to defer a decision on
production cuts to March as they were not convinced that further
cuts would shore up prices.
	   It was not known immediately what had caused the leaders to
plumb for extending their cuts to December 1999.
	   Shortly before the GCC meeting began, January futures contracts
for Brent crude _ a widely watched benchmark _ fell to a record low
of dlrs 9.92 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange in
London.
	   Gulf oil generally sells at a dollar or two less than the North
Sea's Brent _ which itself was selling for around dlrs 20 a barrel
as recently as 1997.
	   At the start of the three-day summit Monday, Saudi Arabia's
Crown Prince Abdullah warned that the oil boom days were over and
that Gulf states should face the new reality and tighten their
belts.
	   He suggested setting a maximum deadline of one year for setting
up a GCC customs union that has been under discussion for 15 years.
A final resolution, to be released at the summit's close Wednesday,
includes the one-year deadline, said summit officials, insisting on
anonymity.
	   The union, the first step to a common market, is a prerequisite
for free trade deals with other trading blocs such as the GCC's
main trading partner, the European Union.

Russian justice minister proposes capital punishment ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's justice minister has submitted a draft
law to abolish capital punishment, a news agency reported
Wednesday. But its prospects for passage appeared dim.
	   Russia promised to eliminate the death penalty in 1996, when it
joined the Council of Europe, but has so far only enacted a
moratorium that prevents courts from carrying out capital
punishment sentences.
	   The bill proposed by Justice Minister Pavel Krashennikov would
formally abolish the death penalty and commute the sentences of
nearly 1,000 inmates now on death row, Interfax reported.
	   They would be resentenced under new rules that would raise the
maximum term from 20 years to life.
	   Krashennikov said it was cruel to maintain a moratorium that
left prisoners uncertain about their fate.
	   ``Absolute uncertainty for such prisoners can be compared to
torture,'' he said. ``It is unacceptable from both the standpoint
of civilized countries' norms and basic morals.''
	   Previous attempts to strike down the death penalty have been
brushed aside by the Russian parliament, which strongly supports
capital punishment. Opinion polls suggest that it has widespread
support in Russian society.
	   Last week, the head of President Boris Yeltsin's Commission for
Human rights predicted that capital punishment would soon be
resumed in Russia.
	   Vladimir Kartashkin said senior prosecutors, judges and police
officials are strongly pushing for resuming executions. He said he
opposed a resumption because it would undermine Russia's
international prestige.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Seventy-five percent of Russians feel that their
country does not observe human rights, a news report said
Wednesday.
	   The public has ``a rather negative opinion of the state of human
rights in the country,'' a presidential commission studying public
opinion said in a paper, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Separately, the country's human rights commissioner reported
that he has received 7,000 complaints in the six months since he
was appointed by the State Duma, the lower house of parliament,
Interfax said.
	   Oleg Mironov, the commissioner, said civil rights violations and
housing problems accounted for more than 30 percent of the
complaints, followed by abuses in the criminal law system and calls
for help by refugees, displaced persons, members of the military
and their families.
	   Mironov complained that he has received only 10 percent of the
budgeted funds due his commission, and said he has found it hard to
carry out his duties.
	   According to the poll report, 44 percent of those queried said
human rights conditions have gotten worse in recent years, while 14
percent said the situation had improved.
	   Among those polled, 55 percent said the right most often
violated was equality under the law.
	   The commission report was based on data collected in 1997 and
early 1998 by the Russia's Public Opinion Foundation. The report
did not say how many people were polled, and no margin of error was
given.

Bookmaker stayed in the same hotels as the Australians

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ The illegal bookmaker in the center
of Australia's biggest cricket scandal telephoned Mark Waugh and
Shane Warne while staying in the same hotel as the Australian
cricket team in Colombo, Sri Lanka.
	   Both Waugh and Warne were fined by the Australian Cricket Board
(ACB) for dealing with a man they knew as ``Pinky'' or ``John''
during the four-nation tournament in Sri Lanka in September 1994.
	   The bookmaker also used an ex-Indian test all-rounder and a
prominent Indian cricket journalist to establish contacts with
leading international cricketers.
	   The bookmaker was staying at the Hotel Lanka Oberoi, the
official team hotel for Australia, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka,
during the one-day series
	   which was won by India.
	   It is alleged that the Australian duo advised the Delhi-based
millionaire
	   bookmaker on ``weather and pitch conditions.''
	   The Chennai (Madras)-based journalist, who was forced to resign
after confessing his dealings with bookmakers, said it would be a
waste of time
	   trying to find the so-called ``Pinky'' or ``John.''
	   ``Looking for him would be a waste of time,'' the journalist

U.S. retailer Wal-Mart acquiring 74 more stores in Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ German shoppers used to high prices, rude sales
clerks and long lines at the checkout take heart: Wal-Mart said
Wednesday it's coming to the rescue.
	   The U.S. retailing giant said it is buying 74 large stores from
the Spar supermarket chain, dramatically increasing its presence in
Germany despite years of little or no growth in the retailing
sector.
	   By adding to the 21 stores it bought a year ago from the
Wertkauf chain, Wal-Mart said it would be able to bring ``the
Wal-Mart shopping experience'' to even more customers.
	   An interim wholesale delivery agreement also reached with Spar
should help Wal-Mart with purchasing and logistics, allowing it to
try to duplicate in Europe the price-cutting strategy that has made
it the No. 1 retailer in the United States.
	   Even the store names will eventually be changed to Wal-Mart.
	   ``As we begin to achieve critical mass in this market, the
customer is the winner,'' said Bob Martin, president and CEO of
Wal-Mart International.
	   The deal will make Wal-Mart a significant force in German
retailing at a time when competition is heating up. Sales have been
flat in recent years, leading to a spate of acquisitions and
restructuring by big retailers.
	   Wal-Mart and Spar agreed not to reveal the selling price, both
sides said.
	   The deal for the 74 stores, which have around 3 billion marks
(dlrs 1.7 billion) in combined annual sales, will become effective
Dec. 31, pending approval by government regulators.
	   The group said the sale wouldn't involve any job cuts because
Wal-Mart will keep all former Spar employees.
	   Wal-Mart sees a bright future by putting its own stamp on the
successful supermarket-department store hybrid in Germany, known as
hypermarkets.
	   ``Acquiring almost 100 hypermarkets in one year demonstrates
Wal-Mart's commitment to invest in Germany and our continued
optimism about this market,'' Martin said in a statement.
	   Wal-Mart has more than 2,000 stores in the United States and
hundreds more in Canada, Mexico and South America. It has jumped
into Germany first as it turns its expansion sights to Europe.

Polish leaders continue campaign for early NATO membership
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek promised
Wednesday that Poland would meet the minimum requirements necessary
to join NATO prior to the Western alliance's summit in April.
	   Poland and two other former Soviet bloc countries _ the Czech
Republic and Hungary _ are scheduled to join NATO next year, and
the summit in Washington celebrating the alliance's 50th
anniversary was considered the likely event for their addition.
	   But the three now want to become formal NATO members before the
summit so they can take part in formulating strategy and other
matters at the April 24-25 meeting.
	   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana has said all three still
must meet unspecified minimum requirements before NATO will extend
formal invitations.
	   Buzek said Poland would fulfill what he called a ``few
fundamental requirements'' for becoming a ``formal functioning''
NATO member by early February.
	   He insisted Poland could meet all the requirements set by NATO
prior to the April summit.
	   While a full list of the changes Poland must make has been
undisclosed, various NATO officials have indicated the major areas
for improvement or compatibility with NATO systems and standards
involve communications and air defense.
	   In addition, Buzek's government has sent to parliament a
proposed new law on classified information that would bring
Poland's system for protecting secrets into conformance with NATO
standards.
	   Other Polish officials, including Defense Minister Janusz
Onyszkiewicz, have said this week that Poland's military will make
the necessary changes to meet NATO requirements before the April
summit.

Gullikson doesn't rule out using McEnroe against Britain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ U.S. Davis Cup captain Tom Gullikson is not ruling
out the possibility of having John McEnroe play doubles in the
World Group match against Britain in April. But he doesn't sound
enthusiastic about the idea either.
	   McEnroe, who turns 40 in February, says he is still the best
doubles player in the world and deserves a chance to play in the
first-round match in Birmingham on April 2-4.
	   ``I'd be happy to talk to John, but at his age he's not the
future of the Davis Cup,'' Gullikson was quoted as saying in
British newspapers Wednesday. ``It's a different game from the
seniors. He's still a great player but he played on the tour many
years ago and the game has speeded up since then.''
	   Gullikson noted that McEnroe has also said he wants to play
mixed doubles with Steffi Graf at Wimbledon next summer and is also
considering running for the presidency of the International Tennis
Federation.
	   ``He's going to be a busy boy,'' Gullikson said.
	   McEnroe, who last played Davis Cup seven years ago, won the
seniors event in London last weekend for his fifth straight title
and eighth of the year.
	   ``I'm in shape and, if seven other guys can't make it, I'm ready
(for the Davis Cup),'' McEnroe said. ``Mind you, I'm not holding my
breath. But that doesn't mean that I don't know in my heart that
I'm better than the guys who've been playing doubles since I
stopped playing.''
	   McEnroe is in Germany this week playing exhibitions against
Boris Becker.
	   Meanwhile, organizers of an indoor ATP tournament in London said
they would be willing to grant McEnroe a wild card into the Feb.
22-28 Guardian Direct Cup. It would be his first appearance in a
full ATP Tour event in years and could serve as ideal preparation
for the Davis Cup.
	   ``I'd go so far as to say we'd also give him (a wild card) in
singles if he wants one,'' tournament director Jeremy Dier said.
``You can certainly see McEnroe playing in the Davis Cup and I
think he would be interested in a tour event over here.''
	   Dier said that Becker has also asked to play in the tournament
and could team up with McEnroe in doubles.
	   Gullikson has until late March to name his team for the match
against Britain. He said he'll need his best players to compete
against a British team that includes two top 10 singles players,
Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski.
	   Gullikson said he is waiting to have a ``face to face chat''
with Andre Agassi about his Davis Cup intentions for 1999. He said
he's already spoken briefly with Pete Sampras but hasn't received a
commitment one way or the other yet.
	   With Agassi, Sampras and Michael Chang all declining to play,
the United States suffered a humiliating 4-1 defeat to Italy in
this year's Davis Cup semifinals in Milwaukee. Sweden routed Italy
4-1 in the final last weekend.
	   McEnroe has been highly critical of the Americans who snub the
team event in favor of concentrating on their individual ATP
rankings. He has also criticized Gullikson and campaigned for the
job of Davis Cup captain.

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The total assets of Islamic banks and Islamic
investment companies around the world are estimated at dlrs 140
billion, Al-Rai Al-Amm newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   It quoted Khaled Budai, a Kuwaiti banker, as saying these assets
were managed by 180 banks and companies in 34 countries.
	   Islamic banking, which is based on profit-sharing rather than
interest, is becoming increasingly popular in Muslim countries.
Kuwait has one Islamic bank and several Islamic investment firms.
	   Budai was speaking at a seminar on the need for a complete set
of accounting and auditing standards for such institutions.
	   He is on a Bahrain-based panel of experts which is working on
reaching that goal.
 &UR; ___
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan is looking for buyers in a bid to
privatize its national carrier to boost revenues, Sudan's official
news agency reported Wednesday.
	   The plan to privatize Sudan Airways would increase revenues from
dlrs 60 million to about dlrs 100 million, the agency quoted
Al-Fatih Mohammed Ali, director of the airlines, as saying.
	   He said the airlines has already laid off 31 percent of its
employees in preparation for the privatization plan, which is part
of an ongoing economic reform program.
	   Ali did not say how many people work for the company.
	   Sudan Airways will be looking for ``a strategic partner to
upgrade its technical capabilities in addition to finding investors
that will provide the necessary capitals for the take-off of the
venture,'' the agency quoted Ali as saying.
 &UR; ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Non-Jordanian investment in the Amman stock
exchange doubled to 116.5 million Jordanian dinars (dlrs 164
million) between January and November this year.
	   A stock market report released Wednesday attributed the sharp
increase to more active foreign trading in shares of lucrative
commercial banks and services companies this year.
	   It said total non-Jordanian share purchases was 189.7 million
dinars (dlrs 267.1 million), while selling amounted to 73.2 million
dinars (dlrs 103.1 million) in the 11 months.
	   In November alone, non-Jordanian trading grew ten-fold to 82.3
million dinars (dlrs 115.9 million) because of Jordan's biggest
deal of selling 33 percent of the shares of the state-owned Cement
Factories Co. to the French Lafarge for 72 million dinars (dlrs
101.4 million).

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian fighter jet crashed in the Far East on
Wednesday, but the fate of the pilot remained unknown, a news
report said.
	   The Su-27 fighter jet vanished off radar screens while on a test
flight near the city of Komsomolsk-on-Amur, about 6200 kilometers
(3,900 miles) east of Moscow, the Interfax news agency said, citing
Russia's Defense Ministry.
	   Though earlier reports said the plane was found, a military
official told Interfax that the crash site had not been located and
the search effort would continue Thursday.
	   Officials said the search was hindered by hilly terrain and deep
snow in the region, Interfax said.
	   The plane was on a flight to test its recently repaired engines,
and a seasoned pilot was in the cockpit, the report said.
	   Russia's military aircraft have crashed frequently in recent
years due to a shortage of funds that has reduced the level of
maintenance and training.

Havel and other dissidents remember meeting with Mitterand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czech President Vaclav Havel urged
enforcement of human rights around the world Wednesday, 10 years
after he started his journey from dissident to president, the CTK
news agency reported.
	   A decade ago, on the eve of the 40th anniversary of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Havel and other leading
dissidents were received for breakfast at the French Embassy in
Prague by then-President Francois Mitterand.
	   The symbolic meeting was the first sign of recognition given to
the obscure dissident group by a president of a leading Western
democracy.
	   A year later, Havel became the country's first democratic
president after 41 years of a Communist totalitarian regime.
	   ``I think we should remember this (Mitterand's) act not only for
reasons of nostalgia, but as a call for solidarity,'' Havel said,
pointing out human rights abuses around the world.
	   ``I think it is our natural duty to show solidarity with those
who still have to fight against it,'' he added.
	   Mitterand had two more symbolic breakfast meetings with Havel
and his friends marking the human rights declaration in 1990 and
1993.

European drug companies Zeneca and Astra to merge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout with details, quotes. SUBS 2nd graf to CLARIFY
that estimated 1998 sales is for pharmaecuticals, not including
companies' non-drug products. Adds byline. No pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By ED McCULLOUGH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The Swedish and British pharmaceutical
companies Astra and Zeneca have agreed to merge their two mid-sized
companies into a global giant, the boards of directors confirmed
Wednesday.
	   The new company, AstraZeneca, would become the third-biggest
pharmaceutical company with combined drug sales of about dlrs 10
billion this year. It would become Europe's No. 2 drug maker.
	   ``I'm convinced this is an excellent business transaction,''
Percy Barnevik, the proposed chairman of the company, said at a
news conference in Stockholm. Barnevik currently heads Investor AB,
the investment of arm of Sweden's Wallenberg family, which owns 12
percent of Astra, which is based in Soedertaelje, 35 kilometers (20
miles) south of Stockholm.
	   About 6,000 jobs _ 11 percent of the current combined workforce
of 54,000 _ would be lost, mostly from marketing divisions, said
Hakan Mogren, AstraZeneca's proposed deputy chairman.
	   McKillop said final merger documents are expected by the end of
the year and that he hoped for shareholder and regulatory approval
soon afterward.
	   The merger had been rumored for months. Confirmation of the deal
boosted Astra's shares early Wednesday by 12 percent, to 169 kronor
(dlrs 21) on Stockholm's bourse.
	   In the face of a wave of mergers in the pharmaceuticals
industry, Mogren said Astra and London-based Zeneca had little
choice but to join forces.
	   ``If we are going to be competitive among world pharmaceutical
companies, we need this merger,'' he said.
	   Last week, Germany's Hoechst and France's Rhone-Poulenc agreed
to merge their drug and agrochemical businesses as the first step
toward a total merger.
	   In France, Sanofi and Synthelabo recently announced their dlrs
10-billion merger.
	   Astra and Zeneca, including non-pharmaceutical divisions, had
total 1997 sales of 15.9 billion dollars, with pretax profit of 3.5
billion dollars, the companies said. The combined value of
outstanding stock was put at 67 billion dollars.
	   Astra is best known as the maker of Prilosec, an ulcer and
heartburn medication that is the world's bestselling prescription
drug. It comprises about half the company's total sales.
	   But the drug is scheduled to lose its patent protection in 2001,
opening the door for generic firms to make a less expensive copy
and slow the company's overall sales growth. Analysts speculated
that was a leading factor influencing the merger.
	   Astra, established in 1913, also makes lidocaine, a popular
local anaesthesia.
	   Zeneca is the second-leading maker of cancer drugs behind
Bristol-Myers Squibb of the United States. It also has a large
agrochemical business and owns Salick Health Care, a U.S. operator
of cancer treatment and dialysis centers.
	   Last year, Zeneca introduced its migraine drug Zomig, and
earlier this year received clearance for a breast cancer drug.
	   But like Astra, Zeneca also has several cancer drugs expected to
soon lose their patent protection.
	   Officials from both companies said their product mix, similar
corporate cultures, and research and development focus make the
merger a good fit.
	   ``It's good for our shareholders ... employees ... customers and
patients,'' Mogren said.
	   The companies said shares would be merged on an equal-value
basis.
	   The AstraZeneca corporate headquarters would be in London, the
research and development headquarters in Sweden.
	   Restructuring was projected to require three years' time and
about dlrs 1.2 billion, McKillop said. Afterwards, annual operating
costs would be about 1.1 billion dollars lower.
	   The proposed chief executive is Zeneca's CEO Tom McKillop.

Arafat on prisoners: Let Palestinian `heroes' go
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Prisoners Israel regards as murderers
are ``heroes,'' Yasser Arafat told cheering crowds Wednesday, four
days before U.S. President Bill Clinton arrives in the region to
prop up the teetering peace accord he helped broker.
	   Palestinians rioted throughout the West Bank on Wednesday, the
fourth day of violence sparked by Israel's refusal to release
prisoners detained on terrorist charges.
	   ``We tell our heroes in the prisons we will not close our eyes
until we see them in front of our eyes,'' Arafat told about 1,000
people attending a conference of his Fatah faction.
	   The crowd cheered, ``If you want fighters, we will be your
fighters.''
	   Netanyahu has repeatedly denied that he agreed to release
Palestinians convicted of attacks on Israelis. He has sworn not to
release ``murderers.''
	   ``Why would anyone who declares that he wants peace would want
to release these type of people?'' Israeli government spokesman
Moshe Fogel said, in reaction to Arafat's remarks.
	   Arafat told the crowd that during the Wye River negotiations in
October, Clinton even named some of the security prisoners to be
released.
	   The Clinton Administration was scrambling to salvage the Wye
agreement before the president's arrival on Saturday. U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright demanded that Israel and the
Palestinians stick to its terms.
	   Her appeals _ and a firefighting visit to the region by top U.S.
Mideast envoy Dennis Ross _ appeared to go unheeded. Netanyahu
continued to insist that a troop withdrawal scheduled for next week
would be delayed.
	   Arafat told his followers that he had defied a plea by Ross to
avoid angering Israelis by not referring in public to a possible
unilateral declaration of statehood.
	   ``They told me not to use or say the word state,'' he said. ``I
told we have said it already and that is it.''
	   In a dig at Israeli apprehensions about the Clinton visit,
Arafat said he believed he had Clinton's implicit backing for
statehood in any case.
	   ``There are six ministers in the Israeli government who do not
welcome his coming,'' Arafat said of Clinton. ``He insists on
coming because he recognizes this people and home land.''
	   ``We welcome the president's visit unequivocally,'' Fogel
countered.
	   Arafat pressed another button by pledging that Jerusalem _ which
Israel says will remain entirely under its sovereignty _ will one
day be Palestine's capital.
	   ``Jerusalem is the capital of the Palestinian state,'' Arafat
said.
	   On Wednesday _ the 11th anniversary of their uprising against
Israel _ hundreds of Palestinians stoned Israeli troops and
motorists throughout the West Bank.
	   Soldiers responded with rubber bullets and tear gas, and at
least 67 Palestinians and two Israelis were hurt.
	   ``I am happy that this meeting is being held in view of the hard
challenges that you face every day from the Israeli army, the
settlers,'' Arafat said, alluding to the recent swell of violence.
	   That kind of statement indicated that the Palestinian Authority
_ despite its insistent denials _ was behind the violence,
according to the Israel government spokesman.
	   ``It is hypocritical to incite and encourage violence to be
directed at Israelis,'' Fogel said, ``and then bemoan the
consequences when Palestinians are injured in the course of this
violence.''

ABU DHABI: countries hard.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Jamil al-Hojeilan, the secretary-general of the Gulf Cooperation
Council, said Tuesday that overproduction by oil-rich nations was
to blame for the price slump.
	   Al-Hojeilan told the Middle East Broadcasting Corp., an Arabic
TV network, that ``the whole problem'' was caused by countries not
sticking to their production quotas.
	   Analysts say Venezuela, Iran, Indonesia and Qatar are the main
over-producers.
	   ``The strategic view of oil policy in the GCC countries is to
keep a balance between supply and demand. We hope that pledges of
abiding by quotas agreed upon are respected,'' al-Hojeilan said.
	   Early Wednesday, Gulf officials were saying that the national
leaders and oil ministers had decided to defer a decision on
production cuts to March since they were not convinced that further
cuts would shore up prices.
	   It was not known immediately what had caused the leaders to
plumb for extending their cuts to December 1999.
	   Shortly before the GCC meeting began, January futures contracts
for Brent crude _ a widely watched benchmark _ fell to a record low
of dlrs 9.92 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange in
London.
	   Gulf oil generally sells at a dollar or two less than the North
Sea's Brent _ which itself was selling for around dlrs 20 a barrel
as recently as 1997.
	   At the start of the three-day summit Monday, Saudi Arabia's
Crown Prince Abdullah warned that the oil boom days were over and
that Gulf states should face the new reality and tighten their
belts.
	   He suggested setting a maximum deadline of one year for setting
up a GCC customs union that has been under discussion for 15 years.
A final resolution, to be released at the summit's close Wednesday,
includes the one-year deadline, said summit officials, insisting on
anonymity.
	   The union, the first step to a common market, is a prerequisite
for free trade deals with other trading blocs such as the GCC's
main trading partner, the European Union.

	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ A commission set up to prepare elections
within 18 months was sworn in Wednesday.
	   The Interim Political Authority was agreed on by the government
and opposition after 3,500 South African and Botswanan soldiers
entered Lesotho in September to quell an army mutiny and unrest
linked to elections last May.
	   The arrival of the troops triggered widespread rioting and
firebombing in the capital of Maseru, in which scores of South
Africans and Lesotho citizens died.
	   Lesotho's governing party won by a landslide in the May
election, but opposition parties claimed the vote was rigged.
	   --
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Five government soldiers were killed in
northern Uganda when the truck they were in drove over a land mine
planted by rebels, press reports said Wednesday.
	   The anti-personnel mines were believed to have been planted by
rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army operating in northern Uganda,
the indpendent The Monitor newspaper said.
	   The incident occurred Sunday when a military truck carrying
troops was passing near the village of Nwoya, about 260 kilometers
(165 miles) north of the capital Kampala when it ran over a mine.
	   The newspaper said five soldiers were killed and the driver was
badly wounded and would lose his arm.
	   Officials were not immediately available for comment.
	   Media reports said on the same day the LRA attacked a camp for
displaced civilians in the area, abducting 18 civilians and
planting fresh land mines.
	   The LRA, which has been operating against the Ugandan government
for 12 years, has been harshly condemned by human rights agencies
for targets civilians in its attacks, frequently abducting children
and teenagers to use as bearers, fighters or sex slaves.

	   MONTVALE, New Jersey (AP) _ A-and-P, an operator of regional
supermarket chains, will close underperforming stores in the United
States and Canada, sell some others and open 175 to 200 new
``superstores'' as part of a plan to improve profits.
	   The company, formally known as The Great Atlantic and Pacific
Tea Co., said Tuesday that it will close or sell 127 of its 907
stores. The company plans to close the stores over the next year
and open the new ones in the coming three years.
	   About one-third of the new stores will replace existing ones, so
the Montvale-based supermarket company expects to wind up with
fewer stores than its current total of 907, but 6 million more
square feet of space, said Andy Carrano, vice president of
marketing.
	   A-and-P operates in 18 U.S. states, the District of Columbia,
and Ontario, Canada. The company's stores operate under the names
A-and-P, Waldbaum's, Food Emporium, Super Foodmart, Super Fresh,
Farmer Jack, Kohl's, Sav-A-Center, Dominion, and Food Basics.
	   The company said it expects to sell 31 stores it operates in the
Richmond, Virginia, region under the Farmer Jack banner.
	   It estimated the closings will eventually generate dlrs 50
million to dlrs 80 million from asset sales and by freeing up
expenses.
	   The company could not immediately say how many people work at
the 127 stores. Not all will lose their jobs. Some may be offered
transfers to nearby A-and-P properties, and others work in stores
slated to be sold rather than closed, Carrano said.
	   Carrano said the new stores would be concentrated around
metropolitan New York, Detroit and Ontario, Canada.
	   A-and-P also said it will continue to consolidate distribution,
manufacturing and administrative functions and dispose of other
``non-strategic'' assets.
	   It has already eliminated two distribution centers, closed a
coffee plant and a bakery, and integrated the management of its two
Super Fresh operating divisions. Results for the company's third
quarter, which ended Dec. 5, will include after-tax charges of
about dlrs 22 million, or 57 cents per share, relating to these
initiatives. Third-quarter results are to be announced in a couple
of weeks.
	   The store closure program announced Tuesday is expected to
result in an additional after-tax charge of dlrs 120 million to
dlrs 160 million in the fourth quarter to pay for breaking leases
and writing down assets, the company said.
	   A-and-P, today, is a far cry from its historic peak. In the
1920s and 1930s, the company operated more than 15,000 groceries,
but it went into a long decline due to competition from newer,
larger stores.
	   In the 1980s it began buying regional chains and has lately been
closing and remodeling older, smaller stores and opening larger
ones.

Officials: ASEAN members disagree on Cambodia timing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's Foreign Ministry said Wednesday
that members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations still
disagree over when Cambodia should be admitted into the
organization.
	   ``The issue is not about whether Cambodia should be admitted
into ASEAN. The issue is only one of timing, i.e. whether Cambodia
should be admitted at the Hanoi Summit,'' the ministry said in a
statement.
	   The ministry said some ASEAN members would like to see Cambodia
admitted at the upcoming summit in Hanoi, Vietnam.
	   It added that ``others feel that while ASEAN should welcome the
recent developments in Cambodia as positive, ASEAN should not rush
into admitting Cambodia when key aspects of the agreement reached
among the parties in Cambodia have yet to be implemented.''
	   Discussions on admitting Cambodia will continue during the Hanoi
summit, the ministry said.

protesters staged a sit-in Wednesday at UNESCO headquarters to
coincide with ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
	   The protesters, led by several French activist groups barred

	   The groups demanded that UNESCO provide them with a separate
hall to organize a ``parallel'' commemoration.

Russian intercepted after walking through the Channel Tunnel

<TEXT>
	   CALAIS, France (AP) _ Whipped by the winds of high-speed trains,
a 36-year-old Russian walked (50 kilometers (30 miles) through the
Channel Tunnel to France after being denied entry to England,
police said Wednesday.
	   The Russian, who was not identified by name, was arrested
Wednesday inside the tunnel not far from the French port of Calais,
where Eurotunnel trains surface after racing under the English
Channel at speeds up to 150 kilometers and hour (92 mph).
	   Police said the tunnel jaywalker apparently began his crossing
this weekend. They said it was a miracle he survived because the
train rails are very close to each other and the high speed whips
up winds that can suck up objects like a vacuum cleaner.
	   British police and Eurotunnel security have opened an
investigation into how the man got into the tunnel without being
noticed.
	   The entrance to the tunnel is closely watched with TV cameras.
Barbed wire and high fences have been set up to keep trespassers
out.

Britain pushes for mini-versions of Speakers' Corner nationwide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A British Cabinet minister called Wednesday for
mini-versions of London's Speakers' Corner to be set up in towns
across Britain, with the aim of invigorating local democracy.
	   The soapbox site in Hyde Park has become a great British
tradition since it was established as an area for free speech by an
Act of Parliament in 1872.
	   Home Secretary Jack Straw, himself a keen soapbox speaker, said
a committee is now investigating how local versions of Speakers'
Corner could be set up for citizens to air their views and hold
their lawmakers to account.
	   ``A hundred-and-fifty years ago, towns and cities, and the open
meetings which took place there, were at the heart of the
hurly-burly of political life on everything from corn prices to
electoral reform,'' Straw said.
	   ``I am keen to revitalize this tradition and encourage local
communities to take part and have their say _ both by speaking out
and by participating in public meetings,'' he said.

Chechen leader says hostages killed while rescue was in works
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: NEW grafs 9-13 with attack on Chechen telecommunications
company. &QL; 
 &UR; By RUSLAN MUSAYEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechen authorities were trying to rescue
four foreign hostages when the kidnappers panicked and beheaded
their captives, Chechnya's president said Wednesday.
	   Aslan Maskhadov, the leader of the breakaway republic, said one
alleged kidnapper was arrested before the killings, and authorities
gleaned enough information to launch a rescue operation for the
four hostages, three Britons and a New Zealander, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   ``A concrete criminal group was identified, an organizer of the
abductions was arrested and an approximate location of the hostages
was determined,'' Maskhadov said in a statement.
	   However ``the criminals brutally executed the hostages while an
operation for their release was under way,'' he said.
	   The severed heads of the four men were found along a highway
Tuesday outside Chechnya's capital Grozny, and hundreds of Chechen
law enforcement officers were searching for the bodies Wednesday.
	   ``We will take all necessary steps to solve this horrible
crime,'' said Maskhadov, who has been unable to restore law and
order in Chechnya since being elected last year.
	   The victims _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf
Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were identified by their
former bodyguard. They had been abducted by unidentified gunmen
Oct. 3 in Grozny.
	   The men were employees of Britain's Granger Telecom, and were
working with Chechnya's communications firm, Chechen Telecom, to
set up a mobile phone network in Chechnya, which was devastated
during the 1994-6 war with Russia.
	   In another development, the Chechen Telecom office was attacked
before dawn Wednesday by assailants using grenade launchers. One
guard was wounded, security officials said.
	   Also, several Chechen Telecom employees have been kidnapped in
recent days, the security officials added.
	   It was not clear if there was any link between Wednesday's
attack and the deaths of the hostages.
	   However, there have been reports that rival groups in Chechnya
were seeking money from the contract to rebuild the country's phone
system.
	   Since the war end two years ago, Chechnya has been running its
own affairs. But it has been plagued by criminal gangs are frequent
kidnappings for ransom. Most hostages have been released unharmed,
though dozens remain in captivity.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook met his Russian counterpart
Igor Ivanov on Wednesday in Belgium and said, ``neither the Russian
foreign minister nor I underestimate the difficulty of making
progress in the lawless state in Chechnya.''
	   ``The Russian government throughout has sought to be as helpful
as it can within its power, but that power is very limited in
Chechnya,'' Cook added.
	   Ray Verth, chief executive of Granger Telecom, said in Britain
that the deaths were apparently the result of a rescue attempt by
Chechen authorities that went ``tragically wrong.''
	   An Associated Press reporter saw the decapitated heads Tuesday
near the village of Assinovskaya, about 40 kilometers (25 miles)
west of Grozny.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin expressed outrage at the
killings and urged law enforcement officials to crack down on
kidnappings.
	   This year, 176 people have been kidnapped in Chechnya and
surrounding regions in southern Russia, and 90 of them have been
released, officials have said.

Russia's nuclear chief hails deal with Iran
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with analyst's comments in new grafs 9-10. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Dismissing U.S. concerns, Russia's top nuclear
official said Wednesday that Moscow would go ahead with a project
to build a nuclear reactor in Iran, but won't hand over weapons
technology.
	   ``Naturally, we will not forget about our international
obligations in the field of nuclear non-proliferation,'' said
Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov. ``Iran is our neighbor, and
the appearance of nuclear weapons there is far more dangerous to us
than to the United States across the ocean.''
	   Russia signed a dlrs 800 million deal with Iran to help build a
1,000-megawatt light-water reactor at Bushehr in 1995. Iranian
officials asked Moscow last month to conduct a feasibility study
for building another three reactors at the same site.
	   The United States and Israel have strongly criticized the
project, saying it might help Iran obtain technology needed to
develop nuclear weapons.
	   Iranian leaders deny any such intention and says the plant will
be used only to generate power.
	   The Russian government has acknowledged that Iran has tried to
acquire technology to build weapons of mass destruction. But Russia
claims it has foiled all such efforts.
	   The New York Times reported Tuesday that Iran had recruited five
Russian scientists who had worked on Russia's germ warfare program,
and was trying to lure more from research centers in Russia and
Kazakstan.
	   Russia's Foreign Ministry and the Iranian Embassy in Moscow both
declined to comment on the report.
	   Vladimir Orlov, the head of an independent Russian think-tank
that studies Iran's weapons programs, said he couldn't confirm the
New York Times report. But he said Russia had been lax in
preventing the export of weapons technology.
	   ``The government's action in the field has been clearly
inadequate,'' said Orlov, head of the PIR-Center for Policy
Studies. ``The facilities mentioned in the report have failed to
receive sufficient financing and protection by the state.''
	   Meanwhile, Moscow insists the nuclear reactor under construction
in Iran can only be used for peaceful purposes, and says it needs
the money the project will generate.
	   Adamov lashed out at the United States for what he called its
biased and politicized approach to the Russian-Iranian contract.
	   ``This is purely a business deal, that we carry out with extreme
precision, bearing in mind its political sensitivity,'' Adamov
said. ``Since Soviet times, our greatest potential has been in the
space, aviation and nuclear fields, and now the nation should earn
money using its intellectual and industrial potential.''
	   Adamov said he took Russian nuclear specialists on a trip to
Iran last month to discuss training Iranian nuclear scientists.
Russia was ready to provide extensive training, but Adamov declined
to comment on the details, saying they were still being finalized.
	   The Iranian project and similar deals with China and India will
generate more money for Russia's cash-strapped nuclear industry
than aid programs can provide, Adamov said.
	   ``American and other (aid) programs total tens of millions of
dollars, while building nuclear power plants will bring hundreds of
millions of dollars,'' he said.
	   The United States has been providing aid to Russian scientists
in hopes that they will not be tempted to sell their expertise to
countries that want to develop nuclear arms and weapons of mass
destruction.
	   The U.S. Energy Department recently announced a plan aimed at
creating new jobs at Russia's 10 nuclear research centers. The U.S.
program will provide Russia with about dlrs 30 million in aid over
the next year.
	   Adamov said that Russian officials also contemplated the risks
of the program, including possible U.S. espionage, and concluded
they were minimal.
	   ``Of course such a danger exists and American (secret) services
will try to use that channel,'' he said, adding that Russian
officials must keep an eye on Americans.
	   The plan doesn't envisage American access to the research
centers themselves, only to the cities where they are located. Such
a move would minimize security risks, Adamov said.

Chechen leader says hostages killed while rescue was in works

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechen authorities were trying to rescue
four foreign hostages when the kidnappers panicked and beheaded
their captives, Chechnya's president said Wednesday.
	   Aslan Maskhadov, the leader of the breakaway republic, said one
alleged kidnapper was arrested before the killings, and authorities
gleaned enough information to launch a rescue operation for the
four hostages, three Britons and a New Zealander, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   ``A concrete criminal group was identified, an organizer of the
abductions was arrested and an approximate location of the hostages
was determined,'' Maskhadov said in a statement.
	   However ``the criminals brutally executed the hostages while an
operation for their release was under way,'' he said.
	   The severed heads of the four men were found along a highway
Tuesday outside Chechnya's capital Grozny, and hundreds of Chechen
law enforcement officers were searching for the bodies Wednesday.
	   ``We will take all necessary steps to solve this horrible
crime,'' said Maskhadov, who has been unable to restore law and
order in Chechnya since being elected last year.
	   The victims _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf
Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were identified by their
former bodyguard. They had been abducted by unidentified gunmen
Oct. 3 in Grozny.
	   The men were employees of Britain's Granger Telecom, and were
working with Chechnya's communications firm, Chechen Telecom, to
set up a mobile phone network in Chechnya, which was devastated
during the 1994-6 war with Russia.
	   In another development, the Chechen Telecom office was attacked
before dawn Wednesday by assailants using grenade launchers. One
guard was wounded, security officials said.
	   Also, several Chechen Telecom employees have been kidnapped in
recent days, the security officials added.
	   It was not clear if there was any link between Wednesday's
attack and the deaths of the hostages.
	   However, there have been reports that rival groups in Chechnya
were seeking money from the contract to rebuild the country's phone
system.
	   Since the war end two years ago, Chechnya has been running its
own affairs. But it has been plagued by criminal gangs are frequent
kidnappings for ransom. Most hostages have been released unharmed,
though dozens remain in captivity.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook met his Russian counterpart
Igor Ivanov on Wednesday in Belgium and said, ``neither the Russian
foreign minister nor I underestimate the difficulty of making
progress in the lawless state in Chechnya.''
	   ``The Russian government throughout has sought to be as helpful
as it can within its power, but that power is very limited in
Chechnya,'' Cook added.
	   Ray Verth, chief executive of Granger Telecom, said in Britain
that the deaths were apparently the result of a rescue attempt by
Chechen authorities that went ``tragically wrong.''
	   An Associated Press reporter saw the decapitated heads Tuesday
near the village of Assinovskaya, about 40 kilometers (25 miles)
west of Grozny.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin expressed outrage at the
killings and urged law enforcement officials to crack down on
kidnappings.
	   This year, 176 people have been kidnapped in Chechnya and
surrounding regions in southern Russia, and 90 of them have been
released, officials have said.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The discovery of the oldest
complete hominid skeleton, dating back 3.6 million years, is
expected to shed light on whether human ancestors ever lived in
trees, researchers at the University of Witwatersrand said
Wednesday.
	   ``It's one of many missing links from ape to man,'' said Ron
Clarke, a palaeo-anthropologist at the university who made the
find. With the skeleton, ``We're getting closer to the ape end'' of
man's evolution.
	   The skull, limbs and torso _ much of them still imbedded in rock
in a cave near Johannesburg _ belong to fossilized foot and ankle
bones discovered in 1994 by Clarke.
	   Clarke and his University of Witwatersrand colleague Philip
Tobias contend that a large articulated big toe on the original
find implied that humans, as they evolved from apes, both walked
upright like men and climbed trees like monkeys.
	   Paleontologists for years have debated whether human ancestors
ever lived in trees. Some say man evolved from a plains-dwelling
species that walked upright.
	   Once the bones are pried from iron-hard rock _ a process
expected to take another year _ they can be examined to see if the
hip and leg structures bear out the tree-climbing theory.
	   The discovery, documented Wednesday in the South African Journal
of Science, was to be reported in the magazine Nature in London on
Thursday, researchers said at a news conference.
	   In a telephone interview from London, a top expert on human
origins said the finding of a complete skeleton is rare in the
study of early man.
	   ``It's wonderfully preserved ... and potentially very important,
but until it's really out of the ground, it's difficult to assess
how important,'' said Chris Stringer, head of the human origins
research group at the Natural History Museum in London.
	   The skeleton was discovered underground at Sterkfontein, a
former lime quarry cave that has yielded a number of hominid skulls
since the 1930s.
	   Clarke and Tobias said it appeared the Australopithecus
africanus, as it is known scientifically, fell down a 15-meter
(45-foot) shaft. Believed to have been 4 foot tall, the creature
lived in a wooded area and was capable of climbing trees, Clarke
said.
	   Scientists determined the creature's date of origin by examining
the rock. Fragments of older hominid fossils have been found in
Kenya, where Meave Leakey discovered a 4.2 million year-old
Australopithecus afarensis.

Russia's nuclear chief hails deal with Iran
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Dismissing U.S. concerns, Russia's top nuclear
official said Wednesday that Moscow would go ahead with a project
to build a nuclear reactor in Iran, but won't hand over weapons
technology.
	   ``Naturally, we will not forget about our international
obligations in the field of nuclear non-proliferation,'' said
Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov. ``Iran is our neighbor, and
the appearance of nuclear weapons there is far more dangerous to us
than to the United States across the ocean.''
	   Russia signed a dlrs 800 million deal with Iran to help build a
1,000-megawatt light-water reactor at Bushehr in 1995. Iranian
officials asked Moscow last month to conduct a feasibility study
for building another three reactors at the same site.
	   The United States and Israel have strongly criticized the
project, saying it might help Iran obtain technology needed to
develop nuclear weapons.
	   Iranian leaders deny any such intention and says the plant will
be used only to generate power.
	   The Russian government has acknowledged that Iran has tried to
acquire technology to build weapons of mass destruction. But Russia
claims it has foiled all such efforts.
	   The New York Times reported Tuesday that Iran had recruited five
Russian scientists who had worked on Russia's germ warfare program,
and was trying to lure more from research centers in Russia and
Kazakstan.
	   Russia's Foreign Ministry and the Iranian Embassy in Moscow both
declined to comment on the report.
	   Vladimir Orlov, the head of an independent Russian think-tank
that studies Iran's weapons programs, said he couldn't confirm the
New York Times report. But he said Russia had been lax in
preventing the export of weapons technology.
	   ``The government's action in the field has been clearly
inadequate,'' said Orlov, head of the PIR-Center for Policy
Studies. ``The facilities mentioned in the report have failed to
receive sufficient financing and protection by the state.''
	   Meanwhile, Moscow insists the nuclear reactor under construction
in Iran can only be used for peaceful purposes, and says it needs
the money the project will generate.
	   Adamov lashed out at the United States for what he called its
biased and politicized approach to the Russian-Iranian contract.
	   ``This is purely a business deal, that we carry out with extreme
precision, bearing in mind its political sensitivity,'' Adamov
said. ``Since Soviet times, our greatest potential has been in the
space, aviation and nuclear fields, and now the nation should earn
money using its intellectual and industrial potential.''
	   Adamov said he took Russian nuclear specialists on a trip to
Iran last month to discuss training Iranian nuclear scientists.
Russia was ready to provide extensive training, but Adamov declined
to comment on the details, saying they were still being finalized.
	   The Iranian project and similar deals with China and India will
generate more money for Russia's cash-strapped nuclear industry
than aid programs can provide, Adamov said.
	   ``American and other (aid) programs total tens of millions of
dollars, while building nuclear power plants will bring hundreds of
millions of dollars,'' he said.
	   The United States has been providing aid to Russian scientists

they were minimal.
	   ``Of course such a danger exists and American (secret) services

	   The plan doesn't envisage American access to the research

a move would minimize security risks, Adamov said.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In the latest confrontation over U.N.
weapons inspections, Iraqi officials on Wednesday blocked
international weapons inspectors from entering the headquarters of
President Saddam Hussein's ruling Baath party, state-run radio
said.
	   Richard Butler, head of the U.N. Special Commission that
oversees the inspectors, had announced earlier this week that
``surprise'' inspections would resume on Tuesday.
	   Iraqi radio said a U.N. weapons team tried to get into the
party's Baghdad office ``in a provocative manner ... without
previous announcement.''
	   The broadcast, which quoted the official Iraqi News Agency, said
the Baath party official in charge demanded that the head of the
U.N. team give him a written declaration ``on the banned items''
the team was seeking.
	   ``The team rejected this and withdrew,'' the agency said.
	   The exact location of office involved in Wednesday's incident
was not immediately known, and there was no immediate comment from
U.N. arms officials in Baghdad.
	   The incident occurred as nearly 200 U.N. inspectors searched for
banned weapons in Iraq.
	   Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for the Special Commission here,
said all the U.N. arms experts in the country were working
Wednesday.
	   Unannounced visits in the past have been a major source of
friction with Iraq. Last month, a U.N. team was not allowed into a
base run by Iranian exiles, the Mujahedeen Khalq.
	   On Tuesday, nine arms monitoring groups, two biological warfare
teams and a missile unit conducted 32 searches, some using
helicopters, INA said.
	   Among the sites visited Tuesday were barracks of the Republican
Guards in Baghdad suburbs and army depots in and around the
capital, the London-based Al-Hayat newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Iraqi newspapers on Wednesday quoted Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz as saying in Moscow that there was a limit to Iraq's
cooperation with the United Nations in the search for weapons of
mass destruction.
	   ``This situation is no longer acceptable,'' Aziz said, referring
to the U.N. sanctions that have blocked free export of Iraq's oil.
	   The Special Commission must certify that Iraq has eliminated its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons as well as long-range
missiles before the sanctions can be lifted.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
have devastated Iraq's oil-based economy. Iraqi officials have long
insisted they have fulfilled their obligations under U.N.
resolutions and that the sanctions should be lifted.
	   The arms inspectors _ who insist Iraq could still be hiding
weapons _ have been a constant source of confrontation between Iraq
and the United Nations.
	   In the latest flare-up, Iraq blocked surprise visits by the
inspectors for three months. They were only allowed to return in
mid-November under threat of U.S. and British airstrikes to force
compliance.
	   Wednesday, the Iraqi press praised U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's statement that a military attack against any country must
have approval of the Security Council.
	   Babil, the newspaper owned by Saddam's son Odai, said Annan's
speech to the French Parliament on Tuesday means that ``the United
States must realize its days of domination are numbered now.''
	   In an apparent reference to NATO, Annan said that regional
organizations have an important world role, but ``any military
intervention by the international community must be approved by the
Security Council.''
	   However, in an interview Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said the NATO alliance ``cannot be hostage of a
veto of this or that country against an operation.''
	   ``Because in such a case,'' she told the French daily Le Monde,
``NATO would be nothing more than a branch of the United Nations.''

Gulf leaders agree to extend oil cuts until end of 1999
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: COMBINES Urgent series; ADDS byline

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ The leaders of six Gulf
Arab states wound up a summit Wednesday with a decision to extend
until the end of next year cuts in oil production that were to end
in June.
	   The Gulf Cooperation Council states ``agreed to extend their
pledged cuts until the end of 1999. At the same time, they urged
other producers to take similar steps to achieve market stability
for the benefit of producers and consumers,'' said a communique
released at the close of the three-day summit.
	   Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and
producers outside the cartel agreed last June to withdraw 3.1
million barrels a day from the market for one year. OPEC's share of
that was 2.6 million barrels per day.
	   The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and
the United Arab Emirates. They together control half the world's
proven reserves of oil. All but Oman and Bahrain are OPEC members.
	   The summit has been overshadowed by record-low oil prices that
have hit the economies of the Gulf Arab countries hard. The GCC
states depend on oil exports for 75 percent of their revenue.
	   While the national leaders and oil ministers decided to extend
the existing production cuts to December 1999, they decided not to
reduce output further.
	   They were not convinced that deeper cuts would shore up the
market, a Gulf official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   However, their decision could be reviewed at the next OPEC
meeting in March if oil prices continue their downward slide, the
official said.
	   Jamil al-Hojeilan, the secretary-general of the GCC, said
Tuesday that overproduction by oil-rich nations was to blame for
the price slump.
	   Al-Hojeilan told the Middle East Broadcasting Corp., an Arabic
TV network, that ``the whole problem'' was caused by countries not
sticking to their production quotas.
	   Analysts say Venezuela, Iran, Indonesia and Qatar are the main
over-producers.
	   ``The strategic view of oil policy in the GCC countries is to
keep a balance between supply and demand. We hope that pledges of
abiding by quotas agreed upon are respected,'' al-Hojeilan said.
	   He denied that GCC oil ministers had agreed to reduce
production.
	   Officials at the summit had earlier made such a claim to The
Associated Press, adding that the GCC ministers also agreed to ask
other producers inside and outside OPEC to join them in the cuts,
starting in March.
	   Shortly before the GCC meeting began, January futures contracts
for Brent crude _ a widely watched benchmark _ fell to a record low
of dlrs 9.92 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange in
London.
	   Gulf oil generally sells at a dollar or two less than the North
Sea's Brent _ which itself was selling for around dlrs 20 a barrel
as recently as 1997.
	   At the start of the three-day summit Monday, Saudi Arabia's
Crown Prince Abdullah warned that the oil boom days were over and
that Gulf states should face the new reality and tighten their
belts.
	   He suggested setting a maximum deadline of one year for setting
up a GCC customs union that has been under discussion for 15 years.
The summit's final communique said an agreement on the customs
union has to be drawn up by 1999 and implemented in the year 2001.
	   The union, the first step to a common market, is a prerequisite
for free trade deals with other trading blocs such as the GCC's
main trading partner, the European Union.
	   The final communique called on Iraq to abide by all U.N.
Security Council resolutions and to admit that its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait was a mistake.
	   The resolution also urged Iran to work for a peaceful settlement
of a territorial dispute with the Emirates, said the officials.
Both states claim Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs, three
tiny islands that Iran annexed in 1992.

was not immediately known, and there was no immediate comment from
U.N. arms officials in Baghdad.
	   The incident occurred as nearly 200 U.N. inspectors searched for
banned weapons in Iraq.
	   Earlier, Caroline Cross, spokeswoman for the Special Commission
here, said all the U.N. arms experts in the country were working
Wednesday.

Survey shows Japanese companies remain pessimistic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese corporate managers are more pessimistic
about business conditions than ever but expect an improvement next
year, according to a Ministry of Finance survey released Wednesday.
	   The survey's business sentiment index for big corporations, a
measure of managers' outlook on the economy, sank to minus 31.2 for
the October-December quarter, the worst since the ministry began
the survey in 1983. The index stood at minus 28.8 a quarter
earlier.
	   The index is the difference between the percentage of companies
that say the economy is worsening from those that say it's getting
better.
	   In the January-March quarter, the business sentiment index for
all big corporations is expected to improve to minus 10.6, while in
the April-June period the index is expected to rise to minus 0.6,
the survey showed.
	   The ministry surveyed 10,959 companies in November: 3,580
manufacturers and 7,379 non-manufacturers. Replies were received
from 81 percent of the companies.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union Wednesday condemned
the slaying of four foreign hostages in Chechnya and said it would
raise the issue with Russia's foreign minister.
	   In a statement, EU Foreign Affairs Commissioner Hans van den
Broek ``condemned in the strongest terms the senseless killing of
the four hostages.''
	   Van den Broek said the EU was determined to see remaining
hostages in Chechnya released unharmed. He planned to discuss the
killings with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, who is in
Brussels for talks at NATO.
	   The severed heads of the hostages _ three Britons and a New
Zealander _ were found Tuesday. The men, who were working to
restore phone services in the breakaway Russian republic, had been
abducted by gunmen in October.

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The chances for a new, strictly secular
government in Turkey faded Wednesday when a potential coalition
partner insisted on giving the Islamic party a share of power.
	   The military, self-appointed guardians of Turkey's secular
system, is adamantly opposed to the inclusion of Islamic Virtue,
the largest party in parliament.
	   Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit needs Turkey's two-center right
parties to hammer together a secular coalition, but Tansu Ciller,
the ex-premier who commands 99 votes in parliament, rebuffed him
Wednesday.
	   Ecevit already has the support of her arch-rival, outgoing
Premier Mesut Yilmaz, head of the other center-right party.
	   But Mrs. Ciller said Wednesday she would not join forces with
Yilmaz, whose government collapsed Nov. 25 over a mafia scandal.
Instead, she reiterated her demand for a government that would
include Virtue.
	   ``We do not oppose Mr. Ecevit's premiership. We will support
him, but only if all parties represented in Parliament are
included,'' Mrs. Ciller said.
	   It was not clear what Ecevit's next move would be. He might try
to form a fragile minority coalition. He might also admit defeat
and return the task of forming the government to President Suleyman
Demirel.
	   Demirel could then choose any member of parliament to head the
government until elections in April.

Swiss white wine with a famous name holds up Europe agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ A still wine from a small lakeside
village with a famous French name was proving Wednesday to be the
last major stumbling block in tough negotiations between the
European Union and Switzerland.
	   At issue is French displeasure over Swiss winemakers' use of the
prestigious Champagne name for their unbubbly white, which sells
around 50,000 bottles each year.
	   But the Swiss vintners protest that they are only following the
Swiss practice of naming their wine after their village, which has
been called Champagne, with variations on the spelling, since the
earliest documents in 885 A.D.
	   Swiss Champagners, who tend their vines above Lake Neuchatel in
Western Switzerland, have been making wine since the 10th century.
The French region began producing its famous sparkling wine at the
end of the 17th century.
	   ``We are agreed on all questions except one,'' senior Swiss
foreign ministry official Jakob Kellenberger told Swiss radio after
an overnight session with EU representatives, admitting the Swiss
Champagne was the sticking point.
	   The French say the name can only be used for the famous
sparkling white wine made in the Champagne region of France.
	   And until the situation is sorted out, the French are holding
out against a set of bilateral trade agreements with Switzerland.
	   Last week, the EU and Switzerland struck a deal on transport,
concluding four years of tough negotiations. The agreement cleared
the way for a wider agreement covering areas like air transport and
labor.
	   The Swiss electorate voted six years ago against joining a loose
European free trade grouping.
	   Fearful of another snub at the ballot box, the government has
frozen an application to join the more closely knit 15-nation EU
trade bloc, which now surrounds the country, and has concentrated
on the bilateral deals.
	   The villagers of Champagne themselves are resigned to losing
their right to use the name.
	   ``If the Swiss confederation gives in, it will have to look at
financial compensation,'' vineyard manager Albert Banderet was
quoted as saying in the daily Le Matin newspaper.
	   A compromise solution which would involve the Swiss wine being
named ``Champagne Village'' was thought to be under discussion
Wednesday.
	   Swiss President Flavio Cotti told lawmakers the overnight talks
made ``very important'' progress.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A strike by airport workers forced more
than a dozen flight cancellations Wednesday.
	   At least 16 flights were dropped in Athens, airport officials
said.
	   The workers, which include airport maintenance and ground crews,
are protesting the merger of their supplementary pension fund with
other plans. The consolidation is part of government efforts to
streamline state spending and earn a spot in the European Union's
single currency group.
	   Meanwhile, the airport in Greece's second-largest city,
Salonica, experienced additional troubles because of snow and ice.
	   Dozens of domestic and international flights were canceled or
postponed.

President approves bill to legalize political groups
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan has legalized the formation of
political groups that may contest elections, a government-run
newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   President Omar el-Bashir signed into law late Tuesday a bill
that allows for ``political associations,'' Al-Anbaa said. The law
will come into effect Jan. 1.
	   The constitution that was approved in June does not mention the
right to form political parties, which el-Bashir banned after the
military coup that brought him to power in 1989. But it does grant
the right to organize political associations.
	   Some legislators have pressed hard to replace such a vague
phrase with ``political parties,'' but Hassan Turabi, the outgoing
speaker of parliament opposed such a change.
	   Turabi, an Islamic fundamentalist, is regarded as the real power
behind the government.
	   Sudanese opposition leaders in exile have rejected the new
constitution, which is based on Islamic law.
	   El-Bashir has said the door is open for dissidents to return
from exile and form political groups.
	   Earlier this month, Turabi, resigned from the speakership to
work full time for the National Congress, which is effectively
Sudan's ruling party.
	   The congress is expected to register under the new law. The move
means it will no longer be funded by the government, officials say.

Romanian prime minister seeks union support for reforms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIHAELA ARMASELU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Prime Minister Radu Vasile is asking
the country's main trade unions for support while he carries out
tough economic reforms, a government spokeswoman said Wednesday.
	   Vasile met the leaders of several trade unions late Tuesday and
will meet others Wednesday, asking them to hold off on organizing
street protests for six months while reforms are implemented, said
Elena Marinescu, spokeswoman for the Ministry of Industry and
Trade.
	   Reactions to the request were mixed. ``If the government really
wants to make reforms, we are ready to support them,'' Marin
Condescu, leader of the Miners Unions Confederation, said by
telephone. ``But I have the feeling that these are only
gift-wrapped promises.''
	   In recent weeks, tens of thousands of workers have taken to the
streets to vent their anger with the government.
	   Workers and union leaders say the government lacks a workable
strategy to privatize state-owned firms. They also claim high taxes
are causing widespread poverty.
	   Condescu, who represents more than 90,000 miners, said
government policies had prevented several state companies from
paying salaries for several months.
	   Some companies have not paid their electricity bills, making it
impossible for electricity company, Conel, to pay mines that supply
coal. The mines, in turn, have not paid their workers.
	   Vasile recently said the government intends to close several
state-owned enterprises by Dec. 20, cutting losses to the Romanian
economy by 15 percent. He did not specify which firms could be
closed, but the Ministry of Industry and Trade recently published a
list of the top money losers, including the refinery Petromidia
Navodari and soda maker Solventul Timisoara.
	   Other state companies are expected to be closed in the first
half of 1999. Tens of thousands of jobs could be axed.
	   The premier told union officials only companies that were unable
to pay their debts for several months would be closed. The
government said it is owed dlrs 870 million by loss-making
companies.
	   ``It is not a time for tepid solutions. ... We have to act,''
Marinescu quoted Industry and Trade Minister Radu Berceanu as
saying.
	   On Wednesday, some 9,000 angry steel workers in the eastern city
of Galati protested because they hadn't been paid for three months.
	   ``It's rather hard to convince (people) to stay indoors when
their children are crying from hunger,'' Condescu said. The average
monthly salary is 1.2 million lei (dlrs 120).
	   The government's proposal comes at a difficult moment. Hard
currency reserves dropped below dlrs 2 billion for the first time
this year. Economic analysts have warned that Romania will be
unable to pay its foreign debts of dlrs 2.2 billion next year.

British crew change for Swiss round-world balloon bid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHATEAU D'OEX, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss balloon pilot Bertrand
Piccard announced Wednesday that he has chosen Brian Jones as his
teammate for his next attempt at circling the world in a balloon.
	   Jones, 52, replaces fellow British flight engineer Tony Brown. A
statement from Piccard's organization said Jones had been training
as a backup pilot for more than a year.
	   Brown stood down by mutual agreement after differences between
the pilots emerged, ``particularly in the area of crew resource
management,'' it added.
	   The new Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon is to take off from Chateau
d'Oex, a resort in the Swiss Alps, as soon as weather conditions
are favorable. The team says it is technically ready to fly.
	   It will be Piccard's third attempt to become the first to pilot
a balloon around the world nonstop. Four other teams, including a
combination of Virgin boss Richard Branson and Chicago millionaire
Steve Fossett, are also planning bids for the record.
	   Branson and Fossett are to take off from Marrakech, Morocco. The
other takeoff points are Alice Springs, Australia; Chicago; and
Albuquerque, N.M.
	   Jones has been responsible for the building of the gondola and
flight systems for Piccard's new balloon.
	   An offer by Brown to give technical expertise and advice during
the balloon's flight has been accepted, the Breitling team said.

Ukrainian president to attend NATO summit in April
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma will
attend the NATO summit in Washington this April, his foreign
minister, Borys Tarasiuk, said Wednesday.
	   It will be the first NATO-Ukraine meeting at summit level,
Tarasiuk said at a joint news conference with NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana.
	   Tarasiuk was speaking after meeting with foreign ministers from
the 16 NATO countries. At Ukraine's request, the three countries
due to join NATO next April - Hungary, the Czech Republic and
Poland, also attended the talks.
	   During the meeting, the ministers agreed on a NATO-Ukraine work
program for 1999. This program will focus on military reform in the
Ukraine.
	   ``We will talk for example about a budgetary reform of the armed
forces,'' Solana said.
	   He said NATO and Ukraine had achieved ``very, very important
progress'' this year in the area of military reform.
	   During Wednesday's meeting, NATO and Ukraine also signed a
memorandum of understanding to send two NATO liaison officers to
Kiev, where the Alliance already has an information office.
	   ``We expect these liaison officers to strengthen NATO-Ukraine
cooperation links,'' Tarasiuk said.

Tamil rebels execute ex-guerrilla wanted for killing family
</HEADLINE>
members &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Tamil Tiger rebels publicly executed a
suspected ex-guerrilla who was running from police who believe he
killed seven members of his family in eastern Sri Lanka, a
newspaper said Wednesday.
	   The guerrillas captured Somalingam Balasubramaniam, 28, in the
jungles of the Batticaloa district and questioned him for three
days before killing him on Tuesday, the Observer reported, citing
unnamed civilian witnesses.
	   The fate of Balasubramaniam's wife and six-year-old son, who
fled with him into the jungles, was not known. It also was unclear
whether he was killed because of his alleged murders or because the
Tigers saw him as a traitor.
	   Last week, police say, Balasubramanian grabbed an assault rifle
and killed seven members of his family after an argument with his
wife in Eravur, a town 210 kilometers (130 miles) east of Colombo,
the Sri Lanka capital.
	   Police believe Balasubramaniam was a member of the People's
Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam, a guerrilla group that gave
up arms in 1987 and joined the political mainstream.
	   But the group said Monday Balasubramaniam was a rebel who
deserted the Tamil Tigers and approached the former rebel outfit
six months ago.
	   More than 56,000 people have died in the ethnic conflict since
1983. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam is fighting for a
separate homeland for minority Tamils, accusing majority Sinhalese
of widespread discrimination in education and jobs.

Polish leaders continue campaign for early NATO membership
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek promised
Wednesday that Poland would meet the minimum requirements necessary
to join NATO prior to the Western alliance's summit in April.
	   Poland and two other former Soviet bloc countries _ the Czech
Republic and Hungary _ are scheduled to join NATO next year, and
the summit in Washington celebrating the alliance's 50th
anniversary was considered the likely event for their addition.
	   But the three now want to become formal NATO members before the
summit so they can take part in formulating strategy and other
matters at the April 24-25 meeting.
	   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana has said all three still
must meet unspecified minimum requirements before NATO will extend
formal invitations.
	   Buzek said Poland would fulfill what he called a ``few
fundamental requirements'' for becoming a ``formal functioning''
NATO member by early February.
	   He insisted Poland could meet all the requirements set by NATO
prior to the April summit.
	   While a full list of the changes Poland must make has been
undisclosed, various NATO officials have indicated the major areas
for improvement or compatibility with NATO systems and standards
involve communications and air defense.
	   In addition, Buzek's government has sent to parliament a
proposed new law on classified information that would bring
Poland's system for protecting secrets into conformance with NATO
standards.
	   Other Polish officials, including Defense Minister Janusz
Onyszkiewicz, have said this week that Poland's military will make
the necessary changes to meet NATO requirements before the April
summit.

Germany bans imports of abused baby elephants from Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Four baby elephants that were taken from
the wild in Africa and abused will not be allowed to be sold to
German zoos, Environment Minister Juergen Trittin said Wednesday.
	   ``An illegal business with threatened animals will not be done
with me,'' Trittin said in ordering the import permits revoked.
	   The elephants were to be sent this month from South Africa to
zoos in Dresden and Erfurt in eastern Germany.
	   They were part of a group of 30 young elephants captured in
August from herds in Botswana and taken to a South African farm
owned by Riccardo Ghiazza through his company, African Game
Services.
	   A South African judge ruled last week the animals had been
abused and deprived of water at the farm. He granted temporary
custody to the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals.
	   Nevertheless, on Monday the judge approved the export of four
baby elephants to Germany and three to Switzerland.
	   But Germany, at least, no longer will take them.
	   Trittin said he appreciated the valuable work done by zoos and
the wish of people to see rare and fascinating animals firsthand.
But he said international regulations on animal protection should
not be violated.

Gulf leaders agree to extend oil cuts until end of 1999

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ The leaders of six Gulf
Arab states on Wednesday extended current cuts in oil production
until the end of next year, ending their summit on the problems
caused by record-low oil prices.
	   Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and
producers outside the cartel agreed in June to withdraw 3.1 million
barrels a day from the market for one year. OPEC's share of that
was 2.6 million barrels per day.
	   The Gulf Cooperation Council states ``agreed to extend their
pledged cuts until the end of 1999. At the same time, they urged
other producers to take similar steps to achieve market stability
for the benefit of producers and consumers,'' said a communique
released at the close of the three-day summit.
	   The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and
the United Arab Emirates. They together control half the world's
proven reserves of oil. All but Oman and Bahrain are OPEC members.
	   The summit has been overshadowed by record-low oil prices that
have hit hard the economies of the Gulf Arab countries hard. The
GCC states depend on oil exports for 75 percent of their revenue.
	   While the political leaders and oil ministers decided to extend
the existing production cuts to December 1999, they decided not to
reduce output further.
	   They were not convinced that deeper cuts would shore up the
market, a Gulf official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   However, their decision could be reviewed at the next OPEC
meeting in March if oil prices continue their downward slide, the
official said.
	   Jamil al-Hojeilan, the secretary-general of the GCC, said
Tuesday that overproduction by oil-rich nations was to blame for
the price slump.
	   Al-Hojeilan told the Middle East Broadcasting Corp., an Arabic
TV network, that ``the whole problem'' was caused by countries not
sticking to their production quotas.
	   Analysts say Venezuela, Iran, Indonesia and Qatar are the main
over-producers.
	   ``The strategic view of oil policy in the GCC countries is to
keep a balance between supply and demand. We hope that pledges of
abiding by quotas agreed upon are respected,'' al-Hojeilan said.
	   He denied that GCC oil ministers had agreed to reduce
production.
	   Officials at the summit had earlier made such a claim to The
Associated Press, adding that the GCC ministers also agreed to ask
other producers inside and outside OPEC to join them in the cuts,
starting in March.
	   Shortly before the GCC meeting began, January futures contracts
for Brent crude _ a widely watched benchmark _ fell to a record low
of dlrs 9.92 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange in
London.
	   Gulf oil generally sells at a dollar or two less than the North
Sea's Brent _ which itself was selling for around dlrs 20 a barrel
as recently as 1997.
	   At the start of the three-day summit Monday, Saudi Arabia's
Crown Prince Abdullah warned that the oil boom days were over and
that Gulf states should face the new reality and tighten their
belts.
	   He suggested setting a maximum deadline of one year for setting
up a GCC customs union that has been under discussion for 15 years.
The summit's final communique said an agreement on the customs
union has to be drawn up by 1999 and implemented in the year 2001.
	   The union, the first step to a common market, is a prerequisite
for free trade deals with other trading blocs such as the GCC's
main trading partner, the European Union.
	   The final communique called on Iraq to abide by all U.N.
Security Council resolutions and to admit that its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait was a mistake.
	   The resolution also urged Iran to work for a peaceful settlement
of a territorial dispute with the Emirates, said the officials.
Both states claim Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs, three
tiny islands that Iran annexed in 1992.

U.N. team withdraws when refused entry to Baath party office
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Iraqi official giving details on planned search,
U.N. seeking to create crisis, quotes in grafs 3-9.
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ An Iraqi official refused to allow a U.N.
weapons inspection team into an office of the ruling Baath Party on
Wednesday unless it produced search papers, the official Iraqi News
Agency said. The U.N. team then turned back.
	   It was the first time a U.N. team was blocked from conducting a
search for banned weapons since Richard Butler, head of the U.N.
Special Commission that oversees the inspectors, announced earlier
this week that ``surprise'' inspections would resume on Tuesday.
	   Last month, a team was not allowed into a base run by Iranian
exiles, the Mujahedeen Khalq.
	   A U.N. team tried to get into a headquarters of the party of
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein at about 9 a.m. (0600 gmt) ``in a
surprising and provocative manner,'' the agency said, quoting Gen.
Hossam Mohammed Amin, head of the National Monitoring Directorate
that provides escorts to the U.N. inspectors.
	   The Baath party official in charge of the headquarters demanded
that the head of the U.N. team give him a written declaration ``on
the material and items'' they sought, Amin said.
	   ``The team rejected this request and withdrew from the site,''
he was quoted as saying.
	   Amin said the behavior of the teams ``has the clear goal of
creating crises and problems.''
	   The exact location of the Baath Party office involved in
Wednesday's incident was not immediately known. But witnesses say
U.N. inspectors gathered in front of a Baath Party headquarters in
the Baghdad neighborhood of Adhamiya on Wednesday morning.
	   The U.N. Special Commission operations room here said the U.N.
headquarters in New York asked that spokeswoman Caroline Cross make
no comment to reporters on the incident.
	   The incident occurred as nearly 200 U.N. inspectors searched for
banned weapons in Iraq. Cross said all the U.N. arms experts in the
country were working Wednesday.
	   Cross said the 130-140 inspectors on regular teams were working
as well as some visiting experts. She would not give the exact
number involved but said it was ``a little less than 200.''
	   When asked if they would be carrying out surprise visits, she
said only the ``inspectors will carry on a full range of activities
in Iraq.''
	   Unannounced visits in the past have been a major source of
friction with Iraq.
	   On Tuesday, nine arms monitoring groups, two biological warfare
teams and a missile unit conducted 32 searches, some using
helicopters, INA said.
	   Among the sites visited Tuesday were barracks of the Republican
Guards in Baghdad suburbs and army depots in and around the
capital, the London-based Al-Hayat newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Iraqi newspapers, meanwhile, carried further accounts of
comments by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz in Moscow in which he
said there is a limit to Iraq's cooperation with the United Nations
in the search for weapons of mass destruction.
	   State-run newspapers first quoted Aziz's statements on his
Russian trip Tuesday. ``This situation is no longer acceptable,''
Aziz said, referring to the U.N. sanctions that have blocked free
export of Iraq's oil.
	   The Special Commission must certify Iraq has eliminated its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons as well as long-range
missiles before the sanctions can be lifted.
	   The sanctions, imposed after the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait,
have devastated Iraq's oil-based economy, and Iraqi officials have
long insisted they have fulfilled their obligations under U.N.
resolutions and that the sanctions should be lifted.
	   The arms inspectors _ who insist Iraq could still be hiding
weapons _ have been a constant source of confrontation between Iraq
and the United Nations.
	   In the latest flare-up, Iraq blocked surprise visits by the
inspectors for three months. They were only allowed to return in
mid-November under threat of U.S. and British air strikes to force
compliance.
	   On Wednesday, the Iraqi press praised U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan's statement that a military attack against any country
must have approval of the Security Council.
	   Babil, the newspaper owned by Saddam's son Odai, said Annan's
speech to the French Parliament on Tuesday means that ``the United
States must realize its days of domination are numbered now.''
	   In an apparent reference to NATO, Annan said that regional
organizations have an important world role, but ``any military
intervention by the international community must be approved by the
Security Council.''
	   However, in an interview published Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said the NATO alliance ``cannot be hostage
of a veto of this or that country against an operation.''
	   ``Because in such a case,'' she told the French daily Le Monde,
``NATO would be nothing more than a branch of the United Nations.''

	   Troops also fired rubber-coated steel pellets and tear gas. In
all, at least 67 Palestinians were injured by rubber bullets and
three by live rounds. The dead was identified as Jihad Iyad, who
died at Ramallah Hospital after being shot in the chest with a live
bullet, said hospital administrator Suleiman Rimawi.
	   The death came just four days before the start of U.S. President
Bill Clinton's visit to Israel and the Palestinian areas, and was
likely to trigger new violence.
	   In the heaviest clashes, north of the West Bank town of
Ramallah, a wall of dense black smoke rose as Palestinians burned
tires, blocking a main road. Rioters, some masked with checkered
scarves covering their faces, hurled stones from slingshots at
Israeli troops in riot gear.
	   ``We cannot let our brothers remain in jail,'' said a
20-year-old stone thrower, who gave only his last name, Jariri. He
grimaced in pain when a paramedic at the scene bandaged his right
hand and wrist after he was struck by a rubber-coated steel pellet.

<TEXT>
	   TUZLA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Two American peacekeepers were
detained by Bosnian Serb troops last week on the same day NATO
troops arrested a Bosnian Serb general indicted for war crimes,
NATO said Wednesday.
	   Maj. David Miller of Appleton, Wisc., and Pfc. Jarred King of
Columbia, Mississippi were visiting a Bosnian Serb army corps
headquarters when its commander, Gen. Radoslav Krstic, was arrested
Dec. 2 on a warrant from the international war crimes court in The
Hague, a NATO statement said.
	   ``Immediately after Krstic's apprehension, Bosnian Serb Army
officers had instructed Maj. Miller and his interpreter to remain
in the corps headquarters,'' said Lt. Col. Stephen Kerrick, a NATO
spokesman.
	   Miller told King, his driver, to remain outside with their
vehicle.
	   King was repeatedly asked to hand over his weapon and
ammunition, which he refused, the statement said. The private asked
to see Maj. Miller and after about 90 minutes was allowed to do so,
the statement added.
	   The two stayed at the Bosnian Serb headquarters for about two
hours until they were allowed to leave, the statement added.
	   ``They were not harmed and mistreated during two hours remaining
at the headquarters,'' Kerrick said.
	   Krstic is accused of overseeing the 1995 massacre of thousands
of Muslims when Bosnian Serb army overran town of Srebrenica.
	   About 7,000 U.S. troops are currently deployed in Bosnia as part
of NATO-led peacekeeping mission and most of them are in northern
Bosnia.

Poll: Primakov most trusted politician in Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov is the most
trusted politician in Russia, but even more Russians trust no
politicians at all, a poll released Wednesday indicated.
	   More than one-third of respondents in the poll said they did not
trust any political leaders, and another 14 percent were undecided.
	   Among the rest, 24 percent said they trusted Primakov, according
to a poll conducted in November by the All-Russian Center for
Public Opinion Research, known by its Russian acronym of VTSIOM.
People were allowed to name more than one politician they trust.
	   Primakov was followed by Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, who
was trusted by 20 percent, according to the poll, carried by the
Interfax news agency.
	   Primakov's rating had nearly doubled since he was appointed in
September, and Zyuganov's was up from 17 percent in a September
poll by the same agency.
	   Prominent liberal lawmaker Grigory Yavlinsky was trusted by 17
percent in the November poll, a figure unchanged from September.
Yavlinsky has a loyal following, but has trouble expanding it
because his market reform ideas have little appeal to many Russians
who are desperate for a stable paycheck.
	   Alexander Lebed, former national security chief who is now
governor of a vast Siberian region, was trusted by 17 percent, up
from 14 percent in September.
	   Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov was trusted by 16 percent of the
respondents, up from 14 percent in September, the poll said.
	   Zyuganov, Lebed, Luzhkov and Yavlinsky are widely expected to
run in the next presidential elections. Primakov has denied any
presidential ambitions.
	   Nearly a dozen other politicians scored in the single digits.
The report did not indicate whether President Boris Yeltsin was
named in the poll.
	   The poll of 2,409 people had a margin of error of 2 percentage
points.

Northern Ireland laureates arrive in Oslo for Nobel Peace Prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with news conference by laureates. &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Roman Catholic John Hume and Protestant
David Trimble arrived Wednesday for celebrations leading up to the
Nobel Peace Prize they will accept in the shadow of discord over
their accord aimed at ending Northern Ireland's sectarian strife.
	   Hume, 61, is a single-minded peacemaker who leads Northern
Ireland's major Catholic party and Trimble, 54, is chief of the
main Protestant party and was a key player in peace efforts.
Shaking hands as they appeared at a joint news conference, both
expressed optimism about the peace process.
	   ``I'm optimistic about the process, but I don't expect the
process to be entirely trouble-free. The important thing is that
our two parties are committed whatever the difficulties may be,''
said Trimble.
	   Hume said the peace agreement will be seen as a watershed.
	   ``A couple of years ago, who would have thought that the two
governments and all the parties would have been in the same room in
a totally peacefully atmosphere? That in itself is a major
progress, given our past.'' Hume said.
	   The Norwegian Nobel Committee picked the two as the driving
forces behind a peace accord reached in April. However, in the less
than two months since the committee announced its decision, the
accord has run into trouble over disarmament.
	   Hume and Trimble arrived together at the snowy Gardermoen
airport, north of Oslo, on a private jet that brought them from
Washington D.C. They were immediately whisked away by a waiting
column of vehicles.
	   They are to accept the prize at a gala ceremony in Oslo's city
hall on Thursday, followed by a traditional torchlight parade and a
banquet in their honor. On Friday, events celebrating their prize
include the Nobel Peace Concert.
	   In its citation, the Nobel committee called Hume ``the clearest
and most consistent of Northern Ireland's political leaders in his
work for a peaceful solution.'' The citation praised Trimble for
showing ``political courage ... a critical stage in the process.''
	   The latest dispute in the decades-long Northern Ireland conflict
came last week when Trimble's Ulster Unionist Party repeated its
demand that the outlawed Irish Republican Army begin to disarm
before its political wing Sinn Fein is allowed to join a new
governing body for Northern Ireland.
	   The April peace agreement envisions Protestant and Catholic
politicians forming a multiparty administration for Northern
Ireland and joint policy-making bodies with the Irish Republic by
October. Neither of those steps have been taken.
	   Although Trimble last week warned that failure of militant
nationalists to surrender their weapons ``is tending to poison the
atmosphere,'' he denied in Oslo that the peace accord was in
trouble. He said he expected the governing body to be in place by
March or April.
	   ``There is a tendency that some elements of the media get into
too much of a spin over quite minor glitches. These matters will be
overcome,'' Trimble said.
	   Hume agreed, saying that since the agreement was endorsed by the
people of Northern Ireland, it is was the duty of all parties to
carry it out.
	   ``Anyone who wants to oppose or undermine the agreement is
acting against the will of the people and acting against
democracy,'' Hume said.
	   In Northern Ireland, police this week said IRA leaders had met
secretly on a possible policy statement. Many hope they will
announce a breakthrough in disarmament.
	   The laureates were just two of many involved in the Northern
Ireland peace process, including Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams.
	   At the news conference, Trimble was asked how he expects peace
to succeed when he refuses even to shake hands with Adams.
	   ``The original idea of a handshake is that someone offered us an
empty hand to show there were no weapons in it. I look forward to
the time Mr. Adams and his associates are able to show an empty
hand. That time will come,'' Trimble said
	   The Nobel Prizes, which include a 7.6 million Swedish kronor
(dlrs 950,000) award, are always presented on the Dec. 10
anniversary of the death of their benefactor, Alfred Nobel, a Swede
who invented dynamite. The peace prize is awarded in Oslo and the
other prizes in Stockholm, Sweden.

Poll: Primakov most trusted politician in Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov is the most
trusted politician in Russia, but even more Russians trust no
politicians at all, a poll released Wednesday indicated.
	   More than one-third of respondents in the poll said they did not
trust any political leaders, and another 14 percent were undecided.
	   Among the rest, 24 percent said they trusted Primakov, according
to a poll conducted in November by the All-Russian Center for
Public Opinion Research, known by its Russian acronym of VTSIOM.
People were allowed to name more than one politician they trust.
	   Primakov was followed by Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, who
was trusted by 20 percent, according to the poll, carried by the
Interfax news agency.
	   Primakov's rating had nearly doubled since he was appointed in
September, and Zyuganov's was up from 17 percent in a September
poll by the same agency.
	   Prominent liberal lawmaker Grigory Yavlinsky was trusted by 17
percent in the November poll, a figure unchanged from September.
Yavlinsky has a loyal following, but has trouble expanding it
because his market reform ideas have little appeal to many Russians
who are desperate for a stable paycheck.
	   Alexander Lebed, former national security chief who is now
governor of a vast Siberian region, was trusted by 17 percent, up
from 14 percent in September.
	   Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov was trusted by 16 percent of the
respondents, up from 14 percent in September, the poll said.
	   Zyuganov, Lebed, Luzhkov and Yavlinsky are widely expected to
run in the next presidential elections. Primakov has denied any
presidential ambitions.
	   Nearly a dozen other politicians scored in the single digits.
The report did not indicate whether President Boris Yeltsin was
named in the poll.
	   The poll of 2,409 people had a margin of error of 2 percentage
points.

Russia urges NATO to respect U.N. charter

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The United Nations is the top
international body for authorizing military action beyond NATO
borders, Russia firmly reminded the 16 NATO countries today.
	   ``The main decision-making body remains the United Nations,''
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov told a news conference after a
meeting of the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council. ``NATO should
keep this in mind while discussing its strategic concept.''
	   Ivanov spoke after NATO foreign ministers met Tuesday to discuss
updating the political and military principles that guide the
alliance.
	   NATO doctrine has moved away from defending against a major
Russian assault in Central Europe to one of dealing with new
challenges, including regional conflicts, ethnic violence,
terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.
	   The allied ministers' meeting lay the groundwork for the 50th
anniversary NATO summit in April in Washington. The summit will
welcome Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic as new members, over
Russia's objections.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Tuesday that
NATO must be prepared to take action beyond its borders.
	   But Ivanov stressed today that any NATO discussion on whether it
should be able to act independently was also ``a question of
external dimension.''
	   ``Any decision on the use of force in our view must only be
taken on the basis of Chapter 7 of the UN Charter.''
	   During their meeting, NATO and Russia agreed on a common agenda
for 1999 which includes activities such as peacekeeping and
military training, as well as talks on weapons of mass destruction
and arms control.
	   The two sides also discussed the situation in Kosovo.
	   ``Due to our joint efforts, we've managed to stop the violence
in Kosovo,'' Ivanov said. ``A political settlement is the only
avenue open to us to establish lasting peace.''
	   He said Russia and NATO are still discussing the possibility of
Russia taking part in NATO's air surveillance mission, but
``technical issues are still outstanding.'' Russia has yet to make
a formal proposal.
	   Today's Russia-NATO meeting comes after a year marred by
conflicting views on what should be done to defuse the violence in
the separatist Serbian province of Kosovo.
	   Russia has persistently opposed NATO plans for airstrikes
against the Serbs unless Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
complied with Western demands to cut back security forces in
Kosovo.
	   But Ivanov noted some progress Moscow and NATO had made in
improving their relations over the past year. ``We've come a long
way from mistrust to mutual understanding,'' he said.
	   Earlier, Ivanov held separate talks with Albright.
	   In a news conference, Albright said the two had gone over a
series of bilateral issues, including Russia's cooperation with
Iran _ ``of major concern to us'' _ and the START II nuclear
disarmament treaty.
	   Russia's Communist-led parliament has repeatedly delayed action
on the START II treaty, signed by the United States and Russia in
1993. The treaty would halve each side's nuclear arsenals to about
3,000 to 3,500 warheads each.
	   Albright said the Russian minister told her he expects the
Russian parliament to ratify START II by the end of this month. The
U.S. Senate ratified the treaty in 1996.

Greek central bank cuts interest rates
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout with commercial banks cutting rates &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece's central bank reduced interest
rates Wednesday, prompting similar cuts by commercial banks.
	   The Bank of Greece reduced its rate on 14-day deposits to 12.25
percent from 12.75 percent, a statement said.
	   It also plans to cut its key Lombard interest rate to 15.50
percent from 16 percent beginning Thursday. The rates, however,
remain significantly higher than in most other European Union
nations.
	   Two of Greece's major commercial banks, National Bank of Greece
and Ergobank, announced they will cut their key lending rates by up
to 3.25 percentage points beginning Monday. In the biggest drop,
the National Bank plans to cut its rate for consumer loans of up to
1 million drachmas (dlrs 3,570) to 16.75 percent from 20 percent.
	   Analysts predict other private banks will also cut rates.
	   The central bank partly attributed the rate cut to declining
inflation in Greece, where the government is struggling to meet EU
fiscal guidelines to take part in the single currency group by
2001.
	   Greek officials predict inflation should fall below 4 percent by
the end of the year. The EU-mandated target is 2 percent.

RAMALLAH: steel pellet.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   In the West Bank town of Bethlehem, soldiers crouched on the
ground to take aim at stone throwers hiding behind overturned
garbage dumpsters. One Palestinian waving a Palestinian flag
doubled over in pain after being struck by a rubber bullet in the
stomach.
	   Israel accused Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat of organizing
the violence, a charge denied by Palestinian officials who said
Israel had stirred tensions by violating the peace accord.
	   In a defiant speech to loyalists from his Fatah group, Arafat
praised the prisoners, many of whom are serving lengthy sentences
for attacking Israelis, as ``our heroes.''
	   The dispute over the prisoners is one of the points of
contention between Israel and the Palestinians.
	   Last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suspended
the upcoming Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank amid
complaints that the Palestinian Authority was inciting against
Israel over the prisoner issue.
	   The Palestinians countered that Netanyahu was holding up the
agreement because he wanted to appease hard-line legislators and
prevent the fall of his crumbling coalition.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has demanded that
both sides stick to the terms of the Wye River peace agreement
Clinton helped negotiate in October.
	   ``I have been in touch with both sides in the last few days,
making clear that it's important for the Palestinians to live up to
their obligations in terms of taking care of the security situation
and following through on what they are obligated to do, and also,
with the Israelis, not to add conditions,'' Albright said.
	   The U.S. Mideast peace envoy, Dennis Ross, met Tuesday with
Netanyahu and Arafat to try and get the accord back on track ahead
of the Clinton visit which was intended to shore up the Wye
agreement, but appeared to be having the opposite effect.
	   In his meeting with Ross on Tuesday evening, Arafat complained
that Israel is violating the Wye agreement by continuing to expand
Jewish settlements and by refusing to release security prisoners.
	   Under the accord, Israel is to release 750 prisoners by the end
of January. It freed 250 in a first stage last month, but most of
them were common criminals. Arafat said he had been made to believe
that all those freed were to be security prisoners, a claim
Netanyahu has denied.
	   Netanyahu, meanwhile, delivered his own list of complaints to
Ross and said Israel would not pull back troops in the West Bank as
long as the Palestinians kept violating the agreement.
	   ``We are not going to transfer any more territory unless the
Palestinians live up to their commitments,'' said Netanyahu's
senior adviser, David Bar-Illan.
	   Wednesday's clashes _ violence also erupted near Jerusalem and
the West Bank town of Jenin as well as several camps and villages _
coincided with the 11th anniversary of the outbreak of the
1987-1993 Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation. Shops
were closed in the West Bank and traditionally Arab east Jerusalem
to commemorate the anniversary and show support for the prisoners.

China warns Taiwan against independence bid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China warned Taiwan on Wednesday against
``playing with fire'' by trying to use elections to justify
declaring formal independence from the mainland.
	   The Taiwan Affairs Office accused unnamed Taiwanese officials of
``contriving to use a citizen vote'' to declare independence for
the island, regarded by Beijing as a renegade province.
	   Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party fled the mainland in 1949
after losing a civil war to the communists. China has said it would
consider invading if the island said it is no longer part of the
mainland.
	   ``All attempts to use a citizen vote as a way to block
reunification and create `Taiwan independence' are dangerously
playing with fire,'' the official Xinhua News Agency quoted an
unnamed spokesman for the office as saying.
	   It wasn't clear what prompted the statement, which came four
days after a pro-independence party in Taiwan suffered a setback
when their candidate was unseated as mayor of the capital, Taipei,
in a local election.
	   Beijing has accused Taiwan's Nationalist president, Lee
Teng-hui, of plotting to declare independence because of his quest
for a higher international profile for the diplomatically isolated
island.

garbage dumpsters. One Palestinian waving a Palestinian flag
doubled over in pain after being struck by a rubber bullet in the
stomach.
	   Israel accused Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat of organizing
the violence, a charge denied by Palestinian officials who said
Israel had stirred tensions by violating the peace accord.
	   In a defiant speech to loyalists from his Fatah group, Arafat
praised the prisoners, many of whom are serving lengthy sentences
for attacking Israelis, as ``our heroes.''
	   The dispute over the prisoners is one of the points of
contention between Israel and the Palestinians.
	   Last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suspended
the upcoming Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank amid
complaints that the Palestinian Authority was inciting against
Israel over the prisoner issue.
	   The Palestinians countered that Netanyahu was holding up the
agreement because he wanted to appease hard-line legislators and
prevent the fall of his crumbling coalition.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has demanded that
both sides stick to the terms of the Wye River peace agreement
Clinton helped negotiate in October.
	   ``I have been in touch with both sides in the last few days,
making clear that it's important for the Palestinians to live up to
their obligations in terms of taking care of the security situation
and following through on what they are obligated to do, and also,
with the Israelis, not to add conditions,'' Albright said.
	   The U.S. Mideast peace envoy, Dennis Ross, met Tuesday with
Netanyahu and Arafat to try and get the accord back on track ahead
of the Clinton visit which was intended to shore up the Wye
agreement, but appeared to be having the opposite effect.
	   In his meeting with Ross on Tuesday evening, Arafat complained
that Israel is violating the Wye agreement by continuing to expand
Jewish settlements and by refusing to release security prisoners.
	   Under the accord, Israel is to release 750 prisoners by the end
of January. It freed 250 in a first stage last month, but most of
them were common criminals. Arafat said he had been made to believe
that all those freed were to be security prisoners, a claim
Netanyahu has denied.
	   Netanyahu, meanwhile, delivered his own list of complaints to
Ross and said Israel would not pull back troops in the West Bank as
long as the Palestinians kept violating the agreement.
	   ``We are not going to transfer any more territory unless the
Palestinians live up to their commitments,'' said Netanyahu's
senior adviser, David Bar-Illan.
	   Wednesday's clashes _ violence also erupted near Jerusalem and
the West Bank town of Jenin as well as several camps and villages _
coincided with the 11th anniversary of the outbreak of the
1987-1993 Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation. Shops
were closed in the West Bank and traditionally Arab east Jerusalem
to commemorate the anniversary and show support for the prisoners.

Twins 1-2 at Asian Games, former drug offender takes gold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS details, quotes from China team leader; CORRECTS Fu
Yong's event in 2nd graf &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Shunsuke Ito came into the world before
identical twin brother Shusuke and pushed in front of him again
Wednesday as they scored a 1-2 finish in the 100-meter freestyle
final at the Asian Games.
	   The 22-year-olds, from Okayama, helped the Japanese maintain
their lead over rival China in the swimming medals table after they
were crushed four years ago in Hiroshima. One of the seven swimmers
who received a two-year ban after those games for using steroids,
Fu Yong, made a winning comeback Wednesday in the men's 200-meter
backstroke. Fu's time was the fourth fastest in the world this
year.
	   China won three of the five golds Wednesday, with Japan taking
the other two to lead 8-6 after 15 events.
	   ``Our parents are here in Bangkok and it's great for us to be
able to show our thanks for them supporting us both,'' said Shusuke
after finishing second behind his brother.
	   The pair have different styles, with Shunsuke a fast starter and
Shusuke a strong finisher, and the elder brother's approach won out
as usual in races between the pair.
	   ``I'm just really happy to have a 1-2 with my brother,'' the
winning brother said. They are good friends as well as strong
competitors and discussed their tactics before the race.
	   ``I finished and I looked around for my brother and I could see
in his eyes that we did it,'' Shunsuke said. They both won a gold
medal in Tuesday's freestyle relay.
	   Shunsuke Ito clocked 51.29 to win the freestyle, a time that
barely put him into the world's top 100 for the year. Shusuke
stayed off the rankings list with his 52.07.
	   And while the twins were taking gold and silver, the bronze went
to ``triplets.''
	   Three swimmers _ China's Zhao Lifeng, Igor Sitnikov of Kazakstan
and Huang Chih-yung of Taiwan _ hit the wall at 52.21 seconds to
get bronze medals.
	   Fu Yong, a bronze medalist in 1994, was too strong for
Malaysia's Keng-Liat Lim and Raymond Papa of the Philippines in the
200-meter backstroke with a time of 1 minute, 59.30 seconds.
	   Another former drug offender, Xiong Guoming, won a silver
Tuesday, but unlike Xiong, Fu failed to show up for a media
conference.
	   China's Chen Hau made the most of the absence of world champion
Chen Yan by winning the women's 400-meter freestyle.
	   Chen Yan, who won the event along with the 400-meter medley at
this year's world championships in Perth, remains ill with a
stomach ailment, according to team officials. The medley world
record holder trailed off badly to finish third in that event
Monday and missed Tuesday's 200 freestyle because of diarrhea.
	   Chen also failed to show up for the heats of the 400 freestyle
Wednesday. She would have been the clear favorite.
	   China's team manager Zhang Xiong was much happier with his team
Wednesday after it capped a night of recovery following Tuesday's
five-event losing streak with victory in the 4x100 freestyle relay.
	   ``That was a lot better than the last two days,'' Zhang said.
``Fu's result was very good and Chen Hau did well with Chen Yan
missing. The fact Chen Hau won that race shows she has grown up a
lot.''
	   After 15 events of 32, the only outsider to break into the
Japan-China pool party was Taiwan's Tsai Shu-min in the women's 200
freestyle Tuesday. Tsai was third in the 400 freestyle Wednesday
with Japan's Sachiko Yamada in second.
	   Japan's Tomoko Hagiwara was first in the women's 100 backstroke,
beating compatriot Mai Nakamura and South Korea's Choi Soo-min in a
race without any Chinese entrant.

BC-Denmark-Businessman Conviction
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Ex-European Parliament member convicted of illegal campaign
financing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ A Danish businessman was given a
two-year suspended prison sentence Wednesday on a conviction of
illegally using 2.5 million kroner (dlrs 396,700) in company funda
to finance his 1989 election campaign for the European Parliament.
	   Klaus Riskaer Pedersen also was found guilty of fraud in the sum
of 4.5 million kroner (dlrs 703,000) by the Copenhagen city court.
	   Amid fraud allegations, the European Union's assembly lifted the
Liberal Group member's immunity in 1984, enabling French and Danish
authorities to start legal proceedings against him. Denmark's
Liberal Party eventually excluded him as a member.
	   Riskaer Pedersen first hit the headlines in the late 1970s when
he became one of Denmark's youngest millionaires. The yuppie
maverick held three Danish stock-listed companies, briefly ran a
financial news agency, and owned a local newspaper group and
estates in Denmark and France.
	   His listed companies went bankrupt in the early 1990s. It took
the police seven years to investigate the case and the trial began
two years ago.
	   The court acquitted him on charges of misappropriation of funds
and other fraud totaling 130 million kroner (dlrs 20.3 million).
	   The prosecution claimed Riskaer Pedersen had let his companies
charge for his flashy life that included expensive cars, a house in
an exclusive neighborhood north of Copenhagen, use of private
planes and purchase of high-priced paintings and rugs.

U.S. envoy ends shuttle between Ethiopia and Eritrea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ After two shuttle rounds to meet with
Ethiopia and Eritrea's leaders, U.S. envoy Anthony Lake left the
Eritrean capital Wednesday to return to Washington, D.C., the
Eritrean News Agency said.
	   Lake arrived in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa Dec. 4 on his
third visit to try to negotiate an end to a border conflict between
the formerly friendly neighbors.
	   After two weeks of heavy fighting in May and June that claimed
hundreds of lives, the conflict has simmered with sporadic
skirmishes and artillery exchanges between troops massed on both
sides of the border.
	   After meeting with Ethiopian leaders, Lake spent two days
holding meetings in Asmara and on Tuesday flew back to Addis Ababa
to hold a second meeting with Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi.
	   He returned to Asmara Tuesday evening.
	   Government and U.S. officials kept a tight lid on the contents
of the discussions.
	   But the Eritrean News Agency said Lake was expected to return to
the region for further talks.
	   An Organization of Africa Unity team led by the regional
agency's Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim is expected to arrive
in Eritrea Saturday.
	   The OAU is going to Eritrea for clarification and consultation,
before a meeting of the OAU central organ on Dec. 17 and 18, where
both countries are expected to submit responses to talking points
outlined during an OAU summit in November.
	   Ethiopia accepted the proposal, but Eritrea rejects the key
element demanding its forces withdraw from the disputed Badme area
to allow an Ethiopian administration to return.

China's gymnasts take all-around golds at Asian Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from North Korean coach, Chinese gymnast,
other details &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China swept the men's and women's
all-around gymnastics golds Wednesday at the Asian Games,
maintaining its unblemished record as controversy erupted over
North Korea's team of diminutive women gymnasts.
	   Concerned that the North's gymnasts might be under the minimum
age of 16, organizers gave the team until the end of the day to
produce their passports. Officials, as well as coaches and doctors
from rival teams, had questioned the girls' ages after seeing them
in competition Tuesday.
	   ``We are going to investigate,'' said Wei Jizhong, chairman of
the Olympic Committee of Asia's standing committee. ``If you want
to check, you have to check their passports, there's no other
way.''
	   A North Korean coach, Kim Song Sil, denied that any of her women
were underage. ``All 16,'' she said.
	   In the women's all-around, China's Liu Xuan scored a massive
38.787 to leave the other gymnasts battling for silver and bronze.
The 19-year-old veteran's commanding performance rescued what was
otherwise an off-form day for China's women, with Liu's younger
teammates both making mistakes that put them out of medal
contention.
	   ``I was the only one doing battle, so I was under a lot of
pressure,'' said Liu. ``I'm very satisfied.''
	   Kazakstan's Irina Yevdokimova got silver, earning her a bear hug
from her coach. She edged out Japan's Risa Sugawara, who took
bronze.
	   Yevdokimova's score was 37.912 to Sugawara's 37.300.
	   In the men's competition, Chinese veteran Huang Xu and newcomer
Yang Wei took gold and silver, complementing the team golds taken
by China's men and women earlier in the week.
	   ``I'm very pleased,'' said Huang. ``All of us could have taken
gold, it just depended who did best on the day.''
	   Yang, an 18-year-old newcomer in his first major competition
said the silver would give him ``a lot more confidence'' heading
into next year's World Championships and the Olympics in 2000.
	   Bronze went to Naoya Tsukahara of Japan, the son of five-time
Olympic gold medalist Mitsuo Tsukahara.
	   ``So-so,'' said the elder Tsukahara when asked to evaluate his
son's performance. ``He wanted gold.''
	   Huang, 19, is a veteran of China's 1997 World Championship team.
He was all muscular control on the rings, barely wobbling as he
completed an impressive routine that scored 9.7. He also was
consistently good throughout the five other disciplines and went
into his final event, the pommel horse, trailing his teammate Yang
by just 0.025.
	   He clinched gold with a nearly flawless display that scored
9.725, his highest mark of the day, for a final score of 57.825.
	   Yang had 57.600 and Tsukahara 57.375.
	   China was looking for more gold Thursday in the apparatus
finals, although it will be hard pressed to match its feat at the
last Asian Games in 1994, when the Chinese took all but one of the
14 golds.
	   Organizers decided to examine the North Koreans' passports after
an official from the Asian Gymnastics Union queried the age of
their women.
	   ``She said I think we better check because their faces look very
young. They don't look 16,'' said Suebsai Boonveerabut, the
competition organizer.
	   But the meeting with the North Koreans shortly after Huang took
gold proved inconclusive because the women's passports were with
another North Korean official who had gone to the airport to meet
someone, she said.
	   The North Koreans were told to produce the passports by
midnight, and the women were allowed to carry on competing, but
their results would be voided if they were later found to be
underage, she said. The top North Korean woman finished 10th.
	   Halfway through the men's competition, Thailand's Saran Suwansa
was taken off on a stretcher, clutching his head in pain, after he
landed heavily on a failed vault. He failed to complete a final
twist on a somersault off the vault and appeared to wrench his knee
as he landed awkwardly. He was hospitalized briefly with a
dislocated knee joint, and was unlikely to continue in the
competition, said Valerie McKenzie, a spokeswoman for the
organizing committee.
	   In the women's contest, a gymnast from Uzbekistan, Alexandra
Gordeeva, also was injured on the floor and was led away clutching
her elbow, fighting back tears. Her coach said later that the
injury was not major.

 &UR; North Korea investigated at Asian Games &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with North Korean coach denying women underage,
results &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Controversy erupted Wednesday at the
Asian Games gymnastics competition after officials decided to
investigate North Korea's team of diminutive women athletes to see
if they were underage.
	   Officials said they wanted to check the North Koreans' passports
to see if they had all reached the minimum age of 16. Coaches from
rival teams, as well as doctors and officials, had questioned the
girls' ages after seeing them in competition Tuesday.
	   ``We are going to investigate,'' said Wei Jizhong, chairman of
the Olympic Committee of Asia's standing committee. ``If you want
to check, you have to check their passports, there's no other
way.''
	   A North Korean coach, Kim Song Sil, denied that any of her
charges were underage. ``All 16,'' she said.
	   Organizers decided to examine the North Koreans' passports after
an official from the Asian Gymnastics Union queried the age of
their women.
	   ``She said I think we better check because their faces look very
young. They don't look 16,'' said Suebsai Boonveerabut, the
competition organizer.
	   But the meeting with the North Koreans shortly after the men's
all-around competition proved inconclusive because the women's
passports were with another North Korean official who had gone to
the airport to meet someone, she said.
	   The North Koreans were told to produce the passports by
midnight, and the women were allowed to carry on competing, but
their results would be voided if they were later found to be
underage, she said.
	   North Korea had three women competing in Wednesday's contest to
decide the best all-around gymnast. The top woman, Son Un-Hui,
finished 10th. The two youngest-looking members of the team, So
Jong Ok and Hwang Kum Hui, did not compete in the all-around
contest.
	   If the passports said that the women turned 16 this year,
officials would have to leave the matter there, said Jackie Fie,
from the sport's governing body, the FIG. ``You can't wage war with
a government.''
	   Meanwhile, Sheikh Ahmad Al-Sabah, president of the Olympic
Council of Asia, told The Associated Press: ``We are doing our job
(investigating) and we will make a decision.
	   ``I believe it is wrong to bring children to compete in
gymnastics, not only here but everywhere. Otherwise they would
start at 4 or 5 years old and it's too young to take the
responsibility of their countries,'' he added.
	   ``We will always follow the international federation's rules on
this matter and if something is wrong of course we will cooperate
with the federation.''
	   There would be no games-wide sanctions, he said.
	   ``This is only one sport we are dealing with and it would be the
same if there was a doping case. If a person was involved he would
be expelled, not his country.''

Egyptian airliner hijacked, lands in Tunisia

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan passengers rioted aboard a chartered
Egyptian airliner Wednesday and demanded that the plane fly to
Libya in violation of U.N. sanctions, police said. But the pilot
tricked them and landed in neighboring Tunisia.
	   A melee developed aboard the plane, an MD-9O, after takeoff from
San`a, the capital of Yemen, en route to Tunis, Tunisia, police
officials said.
	   Airport officials in Cairo said the hijacking incident began
with two masked passengers entering the cockpit and demanding to go
to the Libyan capital Tripoli. Then, they said, a large group of
other passengers joining in the demand.
	   Both the Egyptian police and Cairo airport officials spoke on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   None of the passengers or crew was reported injured, and it was
unclear if the men who entered the cockpit had weapons or if the
Libyan passengers took over the plane by force of numbers.
	   The plane landed in Jerba, a Tunisian island about 50 miles (80
kilometers) from Libya's northwest border, an airport official in
Jerba said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The pilot contacted Egyptian authorities by radio and reported a
large number of Libyan passengers had rioted and were demanding
that he fly to Libya's capital, Tripoli, in violation of a U.N. ban
on international flights to the country, an Egyptian police
official said.
	   About 150 Libyans were aboard the aircraft, which was chartered
by a private Egyptian company for a flight by Libyan businessmen, a
Cairo airport official said.
	   Police said the aircraft itself belongs to EgyptAir, the
national carrier, and that Tunisian and Yemeni passengers also were
aboard.
	   Libya has frequently violated the U.N. flight ban, which was
adopted in 1992 to force Libya to turn over two suspects wanted for
the bombing of a Pan Am jet over Scotland in 1988, which killed 270
people.
	   The police official said the pilot was told by Egyptian
authorities that he could fly to Libya under duress without
violating sanctions, but the pilot apparently tricked the hijackers
and landed in Jerba.
	   The Libyan passengers initially refused to leave the plane and
later apparently holed up in the airport and refused to speak to
authorities, the police official said.
	   Jerba, an island 210 miles (340 kilometers) south of the capital
Tunis, is frequently used as a transit point for travelers going on
to Libya by land.

Northern Ireland laureates arrive in Oslo for Nobel Peace Prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with news conference by laureates. &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Roman Catholic John Hume and Protestant
David Trimble arrived Wednesday for celebrations leading up to the
Nobel Peace Prize they will accept in the shadow of discord over
their accord aimed at ending Northern Ireland's sectarian strife.
	   Hume, 61, is a single-minded peacemaker who leads Northern
Ireland's major Catholic party and Trimble, 54, is chief of the
main Protestant party and was a key player in peace efforts.
Shaking hands as they appeared at a joint news conference, both
expressed optimism about the peace process.
	   ``I'm optimistic about the process, but I don't expect the
process to be entirely trouble-free. The important thing is that
our two parties are committed whatever the difficulties may be,''
Trimble said.
	   Hume said the peace agreement will be seen as a watershed.
	   ``A couple of years ago, who would have thought that the two
governments and all the parties would have been in the same room in
a totally peacefully atmosphere? That in itself is a major
progress, given our past.'' Hume said.
	   The Norwegian Nobel Committee picked the two as the driving
forces behind a peace accord reached in April. However, in the less
than two months since the committee announced its decision, the
accord has run into trouble over disarmament.
	   Hume and Trimble arrived together at the snowy Gardermoen
airport, north of Oslo, on a private jet that brought them from
Washington D.C. They were immediately whisked away by a waiting
column of vehicles.
	   They are to accept the prize at a gala ceremony in Oslo's city
hall on Thursday, followed by a traditional torchlight parade and a
banquet in their honor. On Friday, events celebrating their prize
include the Nobel Peace Concert.
	   In its citation, the Nobel committee called Hume ``the clearest
and most consistent of Northern Ireland's political leaders in his
work for a peaceful solution.'' The citation praised Trimble for
showing ``political courage ... a critical stage in the process.''
	   The latest dispute in the decades-long Northern Ireland conflict
came last week when Trimble's Ulster Unionist Party repeated its
demand that the outlawed Irish Republican Army begin to disarm
before its political wing Sinn Fein is allowed to join a new
governing body for Northern Ireland.
	   The April peace agreement envisions Protestant and Catholic
politicians forming a multiparty administration for Northern
Ireland and joint policy-making bodies with the Irish Republic by
October. Neither of those steps have been taken.
	   Although Trimble last week warned that failure of militant
nationalists to surrender their weapons ``is tending to poison the
atmosphere,'' he denied in Oslo that the peace accord was in
trouble. He said he expected the governing body to be in place by
March or April.
	   ``There is a tendency that some elements of the media get into
too much of a spin over quite minor glitches. These matters will be
overcome,'' Trimble said.
	   Hume agreed, saying that since the agreement was endorsed by the
people of Northern Ireland, it is was the duty of all parties to
carry it out.
	   ``Anyone who wants to oppose or undermine the agreement is
acting against the will of the people and acting against
democracy,'' Hume said.
	   In Northern Ireland, police this week said IRA leaders had met
secretly on a possible policy statement. Many hope they will
announce a breakthrough in disarmament.
	   The laureates were just two of many involved in the Northern
Ireland peace process, including Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams.
	   At the news conference, Trimble was asked how he expects peace
to succeed when he refuses even to shake hands with Adams.
	   ``The original idea of a handshake is that someone offered us an
empty hand to show there were no weapons in it. I look forward to
the time Mr. Adams and his associates are able to show an empty
hand. That time will come,'' Trimble said
	   The Nobel Prizes, which include a 7.6 million Swedish kronor
(dlrs 950,000) award, are always presented on the Dec. 10
anniversary of the death of their benefactor, Alfred Nobel, a Swede
who invented dynamite. The peace prize is awarded in Oslo and the
other prizes in Stockholm, Sweden.

One Palestinian killed in clashes over prisoners
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series, UPDATES with doctor saying dead
Palestinian was 17 &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Despite U.S. appeals to stop
violence, Palestinians stoned Israeli troops and motorists
Wednesday in the most widespread West Bank clashes in months, and a
Palestinian teen-ager was killed by Israeli army gunfire.
	   Helmeted soldiers in riot gear also fired rubber-coated steel
pellets and tear gas. In all, at least 67 Palestinians were hurt by
rubber bullets and three by live rounds. Three Israeli civilians
and two Israeli troops were lightly hurt by stones.
	   The death of Jihad Iyad, 17, who had been shot in the chest with
a live bullet, came just four days before the start of U.S.
President Bill Clinton's visit to Israel and the Palestinian areas
and was likely to trigger new violence.
	   Clashes erupted on the outskirts of most West Bank towns, with
rioters pressing for the release of Palestinian prisoners held by
Israel and marking the 11th anniversary of their uprising against
Israeli occupation.
	   In the bloodiest confrontation north of the West Bank town of
Ramallah, a wall of dense black smoke rose as Palestinians burned
tires, blocking a main road. Rioters, some masked with checkered
scarves covering their faces, hurled stones from slingshots at
Israeli troops.
	   ``We cannot let our brothers remain in jail,'' said a
20-year-old stone thrower, who gave only his last name, Jariri. He
grimaced in pain when a paramedic at the scene bandaged his right
hand and wrist after he was struck by a rubber-coated steel pellet.
	   In biblical Bethlehem, soldiers crouched on the ground to take
aim at stone throwers hiding behind overturned garbage dumpsters.
One Palestinian waving a Palestinian flag doubled over in pain
after being struck by a rubber bullet in the stomach.
	   Israel accused Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat of organizing
the violence, a charge denied by Palestinian officials who said
Israel had stirred tensions by violating the peace accord.
	   In a defiant speech to loyalists from his Fatah group, Arafat
praised the prisoners, many of whom are serving lengthy sentences
for attacking Israelis, as ``our heroes.''
	   The dispute over the prisoners is one of the points of
contention between Israel and the Palestinians.
	   Last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suspended
the upcoming Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank amid
complaints that the Palestinian Authority was inciting against
Israel over the prisoner issue.
	   The Palestinians countered that Netanyahu was holding up the
agreement because he wanted to appease hard-line legislators and
prevent the fall of his crumbling coalition.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright demanded that both
sides stick to the terms of the Wye River peace agreement Clinton
helped negotiate in October.
	   ``I have been in touch with both sides in the last few days,
making clear that it's important for the Palestinians to live up to
their obligations in terms of taking care of the security situation
and following through on what they are obligated to do, and also,
with the Israelis, not to add conditions,'' Albright said.
	   The U.S. Mideast peace envoy, Dennis Ross, met Tuesday with
Netanyahu and Arafat to try and get the accord back on track ahead
of the Clinton visit which was intended to shore up the Wye
agreement, but appeared to be having the opposite effect.
	   In his meeting with Ross on Tuesday evening, Arafat complained
that Israel is violating the Wye agreement by continuing to expand
Jewish settlements and by refusing to release security prisoners.
	   Under the accord, Israel is to release 750 prisoners by the end
of January. It freed 250 in a first stage last month, but most of
them were common criminals. Arafat said he had been made to believe
that all those freed were to be security prisoners, a claim
Netanyahu has denied.
	   Netanyahu, meanwhile, delivered his own list of complaints to
Ross and said Israel would not pull back troops in the West Bank as
long as the Palestinians kept violating the agreement.
	   ``We are not going to transfer any more territory unless the
Palestinians live up to their commitments,'' said Netanyahu's
senior adviser, David Bar-Illan.
	   Wednesday's clashes coincided with the anniversary of the
1987-1993 Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation. Shops
were closed in the West Bank and traditionally Arab east Jerusalem
to commemorate the anniversary and show support for the prisoners.

EU announces plans to improve ties with S. Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union announced plans
Wednesday for a ``comprehensive new strategy'' to improve political
and economic relations with South Korea.
	   The program expresses political support for reforms undertaken
by Presient Kim Dae-jung, calls on Korea to open markets and backs
efforts to defuse tensions with North Korea.
	   ``South Korea has made an impressive start toward creating a
more open market economy and Europe should continue to offer firm
but vigilant support,'' said EU Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan.
	   In a statement, the EU praised South Korea's efforts to ease
restrictions on foreign investments and strengthen supervision of
financial institutions.
	   But it said ``further action is needed to restructure the
coprorate sector, improve banking sector efficientcy and create a
transparent business environoment.''
	   The statement, released by the EU's executive body the European
Commission, said the EU should continue monitoring South Korea's
restructuring efforts.
	   On relations with North Korea, the Commission said, it
``strongly backs the South Korean policy of seeking to engage,
rather than isolate the communist North'' and added the EU would
``seek to actively engage North Korea with the international
community.''
	   EU and North Korean officials held their first talks in Brussels
last week on issues including human rights, food aid and security.
The EU stressed the importance of trade with South Korea which last
year was worth dlrs 32 billion.

In wake of scandal, ICC calls for greater power to police sport
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; BY STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The head of cricket's world governing body on
Wednesday said the scandal surrounding Australian stars Shane Warne
and Mark Waugh was ``an embarrassment to the game'' and called for
greater powers to police the sport.
	   Pakistani cricketer Salim Malik, meanwhile, promised to sue the
two Australians, both of whom have accused him of match-fixing.
	   Former England captain Geoffrey Boycott, however, wasn't
surprised. He said what Warne and Waugh had done was common
practice, particularly in Asia.
	   Warne and Waugh, two of cricket's biggest stars, admitted on
Wednesday they were secretly fined by the Australian Cricket Board
for accepting money in 1994 from Indian bookmakers. They supplied
information on the pitch and weather conditions in Pakistan during
a tour against Sri Lanka and Pakistan.
	   The coverup _ as much as the money payments _ has sullied the
ACB and the London-based Internationl Cricket Council, which also
knew about the fines.
	   ``The image of the game is very important to everyone,'' David
Richards, ICC chief executive, said Wednesday. ``And these
situations should not have happened.''
	   ``It's something that has damaged the image of the game of
cricket,'' he said. ``When they do happen we need to face up to
them, deal with them sternly and them move on to make sure the next
generation of players don't find themselves in these situations.''
	   Richards defended the ICC's silence and said the organization's
powers were limited at the time.
	   ``In 1995 the powers were increased and I note that (ACB
chairman) Malcolm Speed is suggesting today that countries give the
ICC greater powers,'' Richards said.
	   He said the controversy was sure to top the agenda at the ICC's
executive board meetings next month in Christchurch, New Zealand.
	   In Lahore, Pakistan, Malik promised to sue the Australian pair
and suggested the case proved his innocence.
	   ``I am definitely going to take a legal action against Shane
Warne and Mark Waugh,'' Malik said. ``I have suffered so much
because of these false charges by these Australian cricketers. They
have really upset me and have spoiled my cricket for the last two
years.''
	   A court in Pakistan is looking into match-fixing charges against
Malik and former captain Wasim Akram. Australian Tim May, along
with Warne and Waugh, said Malik offered them thousands of dollars
to throw a match in 1994.
	   Former England cricket captain Geoffrey Boycott said it ``was
common knowledge'' that certain players in Asia gave bookmakers
pitch and weather information on mobile phones before matches.
	   ``It's fairly common knowledge that certain players have, on
their mobiles, given information to bookies about the pitch
conditions and the weather and who's likely to bat first and how
the match is likely to go,'' Boycott said.
	   ``Bookies out there where the betting is huge can alter the
odds,'' he added. ``It does them a favor, but it doesn't really
alter what's going to happen in the game.
	   ``But it doesn't sound right, does it?''
	   Boycott said the ICB and ACB made the situation worse by
covering it up.
	   ``Once you have a coverup, it never looks good,'' Boycott said.
``It leaves a nasty taste. The ACB amazes me. Can you believe the
Australian Cricket Board covering it up for that time?''
	   Former England and Kent wicketkeeper Godfrey Evans said he was
stunned by the news. Evans used to be the cricket oddsmaker for
British bookmakers Ladbrokes.
	   ``I'm very sorry to hear that,'' he said. ``I thought it was the
Pakistanis who were in trouble with the Australians bringing the
charges. It's very regrettable.''
	   Graham Cowdrey, a former Kent batsman and now cricket oddsmaker
for the betting firm City Index, said he was ``staggered.''
	   ``In my 15 years of playing first-class cricket in England I
never came across anything like this,'' he said.

Russia urges NATO to respect U.N. charter
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with meeting underway, quotes from
Russian minister and Albright. No pickup. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The United Nations is the top
international body for authorizing military action beyond NATO
borders, Russia firmly reminded the 16 NATO countries Wednesday.
	   ``The main decision-making body remains the United Nations,''
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said after a meeting of the
NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council. ``NATO should keep this in
mind while discussing its strategic concept.''
	   Ivanov spoke after NATO foreign ministers met Tuesday to discuss
updating the political and military principles that guide the
alliance.
	   NATO doctrine has moved away from defending against a major
Russian assault in Central Europe to one of dealing with new
challenges, including regional conflicts, ethnic violence,
terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.
	   The allied ministers' meeting lay the groundwork for the 50th
anniversary NATO summit in April in Washington. The summit will
welcome Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic as new members, over
Russia's objections.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Tuesday that
NATO must be prepared to take action beyond its borders.
	   But Ivanov stressed Wednesday that any NATO discussion about its
ability to act independently was also ``a question of external
dimension.''
	   ``Any decision on the use of force in our view must only be
taken on the basis of Chapter 7 of the UN Charter.''
	   During their meeting, NATO and Russia agreed on a common agenda
for 1999 which includes activities such as peacekeeping and
military training, as well as talks on weapons of mass destruction
and arms control.
	   The two sides also discussed the situation in Kosovo.
	   ``Due to our joint efforts, we've managed to stop the violence
in Kosovo,'' Ivanov said. ``A political settlement is the only
avenue open to us to establish lasting peace.''
	   He said Russia and NATO are still discussing the possibility of
Russia taking part in NATO's air surveillance mission, but
``technical issues are still outstanding.'' Russia has yet to make
a formal proposal.
	   Wednesday's Russia-NATO meeting comes after a year marred by
conflicting views on what should be done to defuse the violence in
the separatist Serbian province of Kosovo.
	   Russia has persistently opposed NATO plans for airstrikes
against the Serbs unless Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
complied with Western demands to cut back security forces in
Kosovo.
	   But Ivanov noted some progress Moscow and NATO had made in
improving their relations over the past year. ``We've come a long
way from mistrust to mutual understanding,'' he said.
	   Earlier, Ivanov held separate talks with Albright.
	   At a news conference, Albright said the two had gone over a
series of bilateral issues, including Russia's cooperation with
Iran _ ``of major concern to us'' _ and the START II nuclear
disarmament treaty.
	   Russia's Communist-led parliament has repeatedly delayed action
on the START II treaty, signed by the United States and Russia in

	   LONDON (AP) _ Lawyers for Amnesty International sought a High
Court injunction Wednesday to stop Gen. Augusto Pinochet fleeing
the country if the British government blocks his extradition to
Spain to face charges of genocide and torture.
	   The lawyers moved as speculation increased that Home Secretary
Jack Straw was close to announcing the decision he has to make by
Friday.
	   Amnesty International fears that if Straw blocks extradition,
the 83-year-old general will be whisked back to Chile before the
group can make a last bid to keep him in Europe.
	   Its first move would likely be to argue before a judge that any
decision by Straw to block extradition would be lawfully wrong.
	   ``We are asking the court to give us the opportunity to
challenge any decision he might make which is adverse to us,'' said
Geoffrey Bindman, a lawyer for Amnesty International and other
human rights groups.
	   ``Effectively, we are seeking an injunction deferring
implementation of any adverse decision pending a challenge,''
Bindman said.
	   Meanwhile, the general's lawyers have complained that a
five-member panel in the House of Lords, Britain's highest court,
that ruled 3-2 on Nov. 25 that Pinochet did not have immunity from
arrest is the head of Amnesty International fundraising arm.
	   Spain is seeking the general's extradition for killings and
torture by his security forces during his 17-year regime.
	   Pinochet, not seen in public since his Oct. 16 arrest in a
London hospital, remained under police guard in a rented mansion at
Wentworth, 20 miles (30 kms) west of London.
	   Earlier, The Times of London reported that Straw had refused to
give Bindman any advance notice of his decision.
	   From the other side, lawyers for Pinochet may ask the House of
Lords to reconsider its decision because of Lord Justice Leonard
Hoffmann's connections to Amnesty International, British newspapers
reported Wednesday.

Russia urges NATO to respect U.N. charter

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The United Nations is the top
international body for authorizing military action beyond NATO
borders, Russia firmly reminded the 16 NATO countries Wednesday.
	   ``The main decision-making body remains the United Nations,''
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said after a meeting of the
NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council. ``NATO should keep this in
mind while discussing its strategic concept.''
	   Ivanov spoke after NATO foreign ministers met Tuesday to discuss
updating the political and military principles that guide the
alliance.
	   NATO doctrine has moved away from defending against a major
Russian assault in Central Europe to one of dealing with new
challenges, including regional conflicts, ethnic violence,
terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.
	   The allied ministers' meeting lay the groundwork for the 50th
anniversary NATO summit in April in Washington. The summit will
welcome Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic as new members, over
Russia's objections.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Tuesday that
NATO must be prepared to take action beyond its borders.
	   But Ivanov stressed Wednesday that any NATO discussion about its
ability to act independently was also ``a question of external
dimension.''
	   ``Any decision on the use of force in our view must only be
taken on the basis of Chapter 7 of the UN Charter.''
	   During their meeting, NATO and Russia agreed on a common agenda
for 1999 which includes activities such as peacekeeping and
military training, as well as talks on weapons of mass destruction
and arms control.
	   The two sides also discussed the situation in Kosovo.
	   ``Due to our joint efforts, we've managed to stop the violence
in Kosovo,'' Ivanov said. ``A political settlement is the only
avenue open to us to establish lasting peace.''
	   He said Russia and NATO are still discussing the possibility of
Russia taking part in NATO's air surveillance mission, but
``technical issues are still outstanding.'' Russia has yet to make
a formal proposal.
	   Wednesday's Russia-NATO meeting comes after a year marred by
conflicting views on what should be done to defuse the violence in
the separatist Serbian province of Kosovo.
	   Russia has persistently opposed NATO plans for airstrikes
against the Serbs unless Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
complied with Western demands to cut back security forces in
Kosovo.
	   But Ivanov noted some progress Moscow and NATO had made in
improving their relations over the past year. ``We've come a long
way from mistrust to mutual understanding,'' he said.
	   Earlier, Ivanov held separate talks with Albright.
	   At a news conference, Albright said the two had gone over a
series of bilateral issues, including Russia's cooperation with
Iran _ ``of major concern to us'' _ and the START II nuclear
disarmament treaty.
	   Russia's Communist-led parliament has repeatedly delayed action
on the START II treaty, signed by the United States and Russia in
1993. The treaty would halve each side's nuclear arsenals to about
3,000 to 3,500 warheads each.
	   Albright said the Russian minister told her he expects the
Russian parliament to ratify START II by the end of this month. The
U.S. Senate ratified the treaty in 1996.

China's gymnasts take all-around golds at Asian Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from North Korean coach, Chinese gymnast,
other details
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China swept the men's and women's
all-around gymnastics golds Wednesday at the Asian Games,
maintaining its unblemished record as controversy erupted over
North Korea's team of diminutive women gymnasts.
	   Concerned that the North's gymnasts might be under the minimum
age of 16, organizers gave the team until the end of the day to
produce their passports. Officials, as well as coaches and doctors
from rival teams, had questioned the girls' ages after seeing them
in competition Tuesday.
	   ``We are going to investigate,'' said Wei Jizhong, chairman of
the Olympic Committee of Asia's standing committee. ``If you want
to check, you have to check their passports, there's no other
way.''
	   A North Korean coach, Kim Song Sil, denied that any of her women
were underage. ``All 16,'' she said.
	   In the women's all-around, China's Liu Xuan scored a massive
38.787 to leave the other gymnasts battling for silver and bronze.
The 19-year-old veteran's commanding performance rescued what was
otherwise an off-form day for China's women, with Liu's younger
teammates both making mistakes that put them out of medal
contention.
	   ``I was the only one doing battle, so I was under a lot of
pressure,'' said Liu. ``I'm very satisfied.''
	   Kazakstan's Irina Yevdokimova got silver, earning her a bear hug
from her coach. She edged out Japan's Risa Sugawara, who took
bronze.
	   Yevdokimova's score was 37.912 to Sugawara's 37.300.
	   In the men's competition, Chinese veteran Huang Xu and newcomer
Yang Wei took gold and silver, complementing the team golds taken
by China's men and women earlier in the week.
	   ``I'm very pleased,'' said Huang. ``All of us could have taken
gold, it just depended who did best on the day.''
	   Yang, an 18-year-old newcomer in his first major competition
said the silver would give him ``a lot more confidence'' heading
into next year's World Championships and the Olympics in 2000.
	   Bronze went to Naoya Tsukahara of Japan, the son of five-time
Olympic gold medalist Mitsuo Tsukahara.
	   ``So-so,'' said the elder Tsukahara when asked to evaluate his
son's performance. ``He wanted gold.''
	   Huang, 19, is a veteran of China's 1997 World Championship team.
He was all muscular control on the rings, barely wobbling as he
completed an impressive routine that scored 9.7. He also was
consistently good throughout the five other disciplines and went
into his final event, the pommel horse, trailing his teammate Yang
by just 0.025.
	   He clinched gold with a nearly flawless display that scored
9.725, his highest mark of the day, for a final score of 57.825.
	   Yang had 57.600 and Tsukahara 57.375.
	   China was looking for more gold Thursday in the apparatus
finals, although it will be hard pressed to match its feat at the
last Asian Games in 1994, when the Chinese took all but one of the
14 golds.
	   Organizers decided to examine the North Koreans' passports after
an official from the Asian Gymnastics Union queried the age of
their women.
	   ``She said I think we better check because their faces look very
young. They don't look 16,'' said Suebsai Boonveerabut, the
competition organizer.
	   But the meeting with the North Koreans shortly after Huang took
gold proved inconclusive because the women's passports were with
another North Korean official who had gone to the airport to meet
someone, she said.
	   The North Koreans were told to produce the passports by
midnight, and the women were allowed to carry on competing, but
their results would be voided if they were later found to be
underage, she said. The top North Korean woman finished 10th.
	   Halfway through the men's competition, Thailand's Saran Suwansa
was taken off on a stretcher, clutching his head in pain, after he
landed heavily on a failed vault. He failed to complete a final
twist on a somersault off the vault and appeared to wrench his knee
as he landed awkwardly. He was hospitalized briefly with a
dislocated knee joint, and was unlikely to continue in the
competition, said Valerie McKenzie, a spokeswoman for the
organizing committee.
	   In the women's contest, a gymnast from Uzbekistan, Alexandra
Gordeeva, also was injured on the floor and was led away clutching
her elbow, fighting back tears. Her coach said later that the
injury was not major.

Celtic owner reaches agreement with Viduka, Croatia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Runaway Australian soccer star Marko
Viduka has been allowed by Celtic owner Fergus McCann to take a
short vacation and then return to Scotland to play for his new
team, a spokesman for his former club, Croatia Zagreb, said
Wednesday.
	   McCann also agreed that Celtic would pay Croatia Zagreb the
three million pound (dlrs 5 million) fee for Viduka's transfer,
Croatia's spokesman Goran Bradic told The Associated Press.
	   McCann flew to Zagreb on Tuesday to sort out the dispute over
Viduka, who fled Scotland just two days after signing for Celtic.
	   Viduka said he was depressed and not fit to play. He came to
Zagreb on Sunday and left for his hometown of Melbourne, Australia,
on Wednesday.
	   McCann met Viduka, as well as Croatia club officials in a
downtown Zagreb hotel on Tuesday afternoon. Both men declined to
speak to reporters, but Bradic said Celtic approved a vacation for
Viduka until Christmas. Then he would return to Scotland.
	   McCann also pledged Celtic would pay Croatia the transfer fee,
as outlined in the contract, Bradic said. Celtic, outraged at
Viduka's sudden departure, threatened to withhold the payment until
the 23-year-old striker started playing.
	   The deadline for the payment was Thursday. ``But we said that it
could be extended to next week,'' Bradic said.

One Palestinian killed in clashes over prisoners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Despite U.S. appeals to stop
violence, Palestinians stoned Israeli troops and motorists
Wednesday in the most widespread West Bank clashes in months, and a
Palestinian teen-ager was killed by Israeli army gunfire.
	   Helmeted soldiers in riot gear also fired rubber-coated steel
pellets and tear gas. In all, at least 67 Palestinians were hurt by
rubber bullets and three by live rounds. Three Israeli civilians
and two Israeli troops were lightly hurt by stones.
	   The death of Jihad Iyad, 17, who had been shot in the chest with
a live bullet, came just four days before the start of U.S.
President Bill Clinton's visit to Israel and the Palestinian areas
and was likely to trigger new violence.
	   Clashes erupted on the outskirts of most West Bank towns, with
rioters pressing for the release of Palestinian prisoners held by
Israel and marking the 11th anniversary of their uprising against
Israeli occupation.
	   In the bloodiest confrontation north of the West Bank town of
Ramallah, a wall of dense black smoke rose as Palestinians burned
tires, blocking a main road. Rioters, some masked with checkered
scarves covering their faces, hurled stones from slingshots at
Israeli troops.
	   ``We cannot let our brothers remain in jail,'' said a
20-year-old stone thrower, who gave only his last name, Jariri. He
grimaced in pain when a paramedic at the scene bandaged his right
hand and wrist after he was struck by a rubber-coated steel pellet.
	   In biblical Bethlehem, soldiers crouched on the ground to take
aim at stone throwers hiding behind overturned garbage dumpsters.
One man waving a Palestinian flag doubled over in pain after being
struck by a rubber bullet in the stomach.
	   Israel accused Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat of organizing
the violence, a charge denied by Palestinian officials who said
Israel had stirred tensions by violating the peace accord.
	   In a defiant speech to loyalists from his Fatah group, Arafat
praised the prisoners, many of whom are serving lengthy sentences
for attacking Israelis, as ``our heroes.''
	   The dispute over the prisoners is one of the points of
contention between Israel and the Palestinians.
	   Last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suspended
the upcoming Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank amid
complaints that the Palestinian Authority was inciting against
Israel over the prisoner issue.
	   The Palestinians countered that Netanyahu was holding up the
agreement because he wanted to appease hard-line legislators and
prevent the fall of his crumbling coalition.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright demanded that both
sides stick to the terms of the Wye River peace agreement Clinton
helped negotiate in October.
	   ``I have been in touch with both sides in the last few days,
making clear that it's important for the Palestinians to live up to
their obligations in terms of taking care of the security situation
and following through on what they are obligated to do, and also,
with the Israelis, not to add conditions,'' Albright said.
	   The U.S. Mideast peace envoy, Dennis Ross, met Tuesday with
Netanyahu and Arafat to try and get the accord back on track ahead
of the Clinton visit which was intended to shore up the Wye
agreement, but appeared to be having the opposite effect.
	   In his meeting with Ross on Tuesday evening, Arafat complained
that Israel is violating the Wye agreement by continuing to expand
Jewish settlements and by refusing to release security prisoners.
	   Under the accord, Israel is to release 750 prisoners by the end
of January. It freed 250 in a first stage last month, but most of
them were common criminals. Arafat said he had been made to believe
that all those freed were to be security prisoners, a claim
Netanyahu has denied.
	   Netanyahu, meanwhile, delivered his own list of complaints to
Ross and said Israel would not pull back troops in the West Bank as
long as the Palestinians kept violating the agreement.
	   ``We are not going to transfer any more territory unless the
Palestinians live up to their commitments,'' said Netanyahu's
senior adviser, David Bar-Illan.
	   Wednesday's clashes coincided with the anniversary of the
1987-1993 Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation. Shops
were closed in the West Bank and traditionally Arab east Jerusalem
to commemorate the anniversary and show support for the prisoners.

Angolan government, rebels continue battle for highland towns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Government jets Wednesday staged new air
strikes against the central highland strongholds of the rebel group
UNITA, but rebel forces had successfully repelled a five-day ground
offensive, a UNITA spokesman said.
	   UNITA Secretary-General Paulo Lukamba Gato said his group's
forces had driven back a major government attack which appeared to
mark a definitive end to the ailing 1994 peace pact that halted a
two-decade civil war between the two sides.
	   ``They're bombing us but they're just destroying buildings, not
people,'' Gato said by satellite telephone.
	   Defense Ministry officials declined to comment on the reported
military activity around Andulo and Bailundo, rural towns about 290
kilometers (180 miles) southeast of Luanda where the UNITA
leadership lives.
	   Officials would say only that the area was ``an operational
zone'' and referred to a speech last Friday by President Jose
Eduardo dos Santos who called for the ``political and military
neutralization'' of UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi.
	   Western intelligence sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the two sides had been fighting around the two
towns since last Friday and that the military situation appeared
deadlocked.
	   UNITA claims the government deployed some 15,000 troops in a
pincer movement but that they were driven back by Savimbi's
so-called presidential guard, which is an elite force, and by local
militias.
	   Gato said the government troops had retreated to 60 kilometers
(37 miles) away from Andulo and 20 kilometers (12 miles) from
Bailundo. Gato said he was in Bailundo, though it was not possible
to confirm that.
	   The towns lie in mountainous terrain, with peaks of more than
2,000 meters (6,600 feet), and frequent mists and low cloud during
the current rainy season apparently have impeded larger-scale
strikes by the government air force. UNITA has no air power.
	   Intelligence sources said the outcome of the battle could hinge
on how long the government forces maintained their supply lines
from the capital intact.
	   ``Angola is a very big country and this is a very big offensive
by the government, but UNITA is very well equipped, so the next few
days will be crucial in seeing whether the army can sustain its
attack,'' a western official said on condition of anonymity.
	   The World Food Program office in Luanda reported that some 4,500
newly displaced people were converging on the city of Kuito, about
100 kilometers (62 miles) south of Andulo.
	   WFP delegations in 10 other cities around the country reported
no fighting, spokeswoman Jeanne Boistlair said by phone.
	   The fighting erupted after months of skirmishes and a bitter war
of words between the two sides.
	   The government accused UNITA of maintaining a hidden army in
breach of the peace accord, while the rebels accused the police and
army of human rights abuses.
	   The civil war began after the southwest African nation's 1975
independence from Portugal, and an estimated 500,000 people were
killed in the fighting.

Defying U.N. pressure, Yugoslavia goes ahead with massacre probe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Defying U.N. pressure to extradite
three former Serb officers charged with war crimes, Yugoslavia
pressed ahead Wednesday with its own probe, making them witnesses
rather than suspects.
	   The three Serbs sought by the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The
Hague, Netherlands _ Veselin Sljivancanin, Miroslav Radic and Milan
Mrksic _ are accused of ordering the 1991 massacre of 261 Croats
taken out of a hospital in Vukovar in eastern Croatia.
	   Refusing to hand over the officers, the Military Court in
Belgrade said it would hold its own probe against ``unknown
persons'' involved in the Vukovar massacre. It added that the three
officers would be questioned only as witnesses and not as suspects.
	   The Yugoslav military prosecutor rejected the tribunal's charges
against the three as ``unfounded'' and invited the men as witnesses
during the investigation, the state news agency Tanjug reported.
	   The independent Belgrade news agency Beta, citing a Military
Court document, said the probe will be held Dec. 17 in Belgrade. It
added that representatives from the Hague tribunal had been invited
to attend the proceedings.
	   The Military Court president has requested the tribunal's files
on the three men, which form the basis for their indictment by the
tribunal, Tanjug reported.
	   The tribunal has made no official response to the request.
	   Prosecutors from the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal plan to ask
judges Wednesday to order Belgrade authorities to stop their
investigation of the massacre and hand over any evidence they have
collected.
	   Judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald, president of the Hague tribunal,
Tuesday accused the government of President Slobodan Milosevic of
``unabashedly obstructing the explicit directives of the Security
Council.''
	   She was referring to repeated Security Council demands to
extradite the three.
	   She asked the Security Council to determine ``the appropriate
measures'' to take against Belgrade, beyond its previous
condemnation of Yugoslavia's failure to cooperate with war crimes
investigators. The council also should demand the arrest of the
three men, who are charged with organizing a massacre, she said.
	   But Russia, which has close political ties to Yugoslavia,
blocked even a press statement from the council president
condemning Yugoslavia's latest failure to cooperate with war crimes
investigators, diplomats said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   McDonald said the decision by the Military Court in Belgrade to
conduct an investigation of war crimes at the Vukovar hospital was

Chechen leader says hostages killed while rescue was in works

	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechen authorities were trying to rescue
four foreign hostages when the kidnappers panicked and beheaded
their captives, Chechnya's president said Wednesday.
	   Aslan Maskhadov, the leader of the breakaway republic, said one
alleged kidnapper was arrested before the killings, and authorities
gleaned enough information to launch a rescue operation for the
four hostages, three Britons and a New Zealander, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   ``A concrete criminal group was identified, an organizer of the
abductions was arrested and an approximate location of the hostages
was determined,'' Maskhadov said in a statement.
	   However ``the criminals brutally executed the hostages while an
operation for their release was under way,'' he said.
	   The severed heads of the four men were found along a highway
Tuesday outside Chechnya's capital Grozny, and hundreds of Chechen
law enforcement officers were searching for the bodies Wednesday.
	   ``We will take all necessary steps to solve this horrible
crime,'' said Maskhadov, who has been unable to restore law and
order in Chechnya since being elected last year.
	   The victims _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf
Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were identified by their
former bodyguard. They had been abducted by unidentified gunmen
Oct. 3 in Grozny.
	   The men were employees of Britain's Granger Telecom, and were
working with Chechnya's communications firm, Chechen Telecom, to
set up a mobile phone network in Chechnya, which was devastated
during the 1994-6 war with Russia.
	   In another development, the Chechen Telecom office was attacked
before dawn Wednesday by assailants using grenade launchers. One
guard was wounded, security officials said.
	   Also, several Chechen Telecom employees have been kidnapped in
recent days, the security officials added.
	   It was not clear if there was any link between Wednesday's
attack and the deaths of the hostages.
	   However, there have been reports that rival groups in Chechnya
were seeking money from the contract to rebuild the country's phone
system.
	   Meanwhile, three Russian republics bordering Chechnya blocked
off all roads leading to and from the secessionist territory.
	   ``The Chechen republic has been sealed off from all sides,''
Magomet Khatuyev, the head of Chechnya's border service, told
Interfax.
	   Since the war end two years ago, Chechnya has been running its
own affairs. But it has been plagued by criminal gangs are frequent
kidnappings for ransom. Most hostages have been released unharmed,
though dozens remain in captivity.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook met his Russian counterpart
Igor Ivanov on Wednesday in Belgium and said, ``neither the Russian
foreign minister nor I underestimate the difficulty of making
progress in the lawless state in Chechnya.''
	   ``The Russian government throughout has sought to be as helpful
as it can within its power, but that power is very limited in
Chechnya,'' Cook added.
	   Ray Verth, chief executive of Granger Telecom, said in Britain
that the deaths were apparently the result of a rescue attempt by
Chechen authorities that went ``tragically wrong.''
	   An Associated Press reporter saw the decapitated heads Tuesday
near the village of Assinovskaya, about 40 kilometers (25 miles)
west of Grozny.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin expressed outrage at the
killings and urged law enforcement officials to crack down on
kidnappings.
	   This year, 176 people have been kidnapped in Chechnya and
surrounding regions in southern Russia, and 90 of them have been
released, officials have said.

Amnesty International asks court to block swift Pinochet departure

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Lawyers for Amnesty International sought a High
Court injunction Wednesday to stop Gen. Augusto Pinochet fleeing
the country if the British government blocks his extradition to
Spain to face charges of genocide and torture.
	   The lawyers moved as speculation increased that Home Secretary
Jack Straw was close to announcing the decision he has to make by
Friday.
	   Amnesty International fears that if Straw blocks extradition,
the 83-year-old general will be whisked back to Chile before the
group can make a last bid to keep him in Europe.
	   Its first move would likely be to argue before a judge that any
decision by Straw to block extradition would be lawfully wrong.
	   ``We are asking the court to give us the opportunity to
challenge any decision he might make which is adverse to us,'' said
Geoffrey Bindman, a lawyer for Amnesty International and other
human rights groups.
	   ``Effectively, we are seeking an injunction deferring
implementation of any adverse decision pending a challenge,''
Bindman said.
	   Meanwhile, the general's lawyers have complained that a judge
who is the head of Amnesty International's fundraising arm was on a
five-member panel in the House of Lords, Britain's highest court,
which ruled 3-2 on Nov. 25 that Pinochet did not have immunity from
arrest.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The army decided Wednesday to court-martial an
Israeli soldier whose beating by a Palestinian mob, captured by TV
cameras, shocked the country and froze the peace process.
	   Cpl. Assaf Meyara, 19, will be charged with not carrying a
loaded weapon and leaving his base without permission.
	   However, the army will not bring charges against the young
soldier for not firing his M-16 rifle on his attackers, who smashed
the windows of the car he was traveling in, dragged him out and
struck him repeatedly in the head with chunks of concrete.
	   The attack took place last week in the West Bank town of
Ramallah. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
suspended the Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   The army spokesman's office said a soldier should have opened
fire under such circumstances. Meyara told investigators, however,
that he was unable to act because he was incapacitated by one of
the first rocks striking his head.
	   The attackers also stole Meyara's rifle as he ran to safety. The
pictures of Meyara cowering under the Palestinians and not trying
to fight back touched off a national debate over whether Israel had
lost its military nerve.
	   The army also said it will discipline Meyara's commanding
officer for not having given him proper instructions or adequate
shooting practice. Meyara's mother said he had only been in the
volatile West Bank for a few weeks.
	   The army also is taking disciplinary action against two officers
who drove by the crowd of stone throwers just minutes before the
attack on Meyara. Their jeep also was hit by stones, but they did
not stop to make the intersection safe for others or report the
incident.

Libyan passengers commandeer Egyptian airliner in mid-air drama
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with police saying all passengers have left the plane;
other details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan passengers rioted aboard a chartered
Egyptian airliner and demanded that the plane fly to Libya in
violation of U.N. sanctions, police said. But the pilot tricked
them and landed in neighboring Tunisia.
	   Egyptian airport police officials said all passengers later left
the plane, ending the 15-hour crisis that began in mid-air while
the plane was flying from Yemen to Tunis, Tunisia.
	   The plane, however, landed in Jerba, a Tunisian island about 80
kilometers (50 miles) from Libya's northwest border, an airport
official in Jerba said, insisting his name not be used.
	   About 150 Libyans were aboard the MD-90 aircraft, which was
chartered by a private Egyptian company for a flight by Libyan
businessmen, the officials said. The spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   They said the aircraft itself belongs to EgyptAir, the national
carrier, and that Tunisian and Yemeni passengers also were aboard.
	   Soon after the plane took off, two masked passengers entered the
cockpit and demanded to go to the Libyan capital Tripoli. Then,
they said, a large group of other passengers joined in the demand.
	   None of the passengers or crew was reported injured. Officials
said many of the passengers were carrying daggers, as is the custom
among Libyan and Yemeni men, but they did not use it to threaten
the crew.
	   It was unclear whether the masked men used daggers in the
cockpit or if the passengers overwhelmed the pilot by force of
numbers before he managed to land in Jerba.
	   In Jerba, some passengers left the plane complaining of
exhaustion while many others remained on board demanding that the
aircraft be refueled, the Egyptian officials said. But all
remaining passengers also left the aircraft later, said the
officials.
	   It was not clear if any of them had been taken into custody at
the airport where they were apparently holed up.
	   The Egyptian officials were apparently getting their information
from Tunisian authorities and the pilot who was in touch with Egypt
by radio.
	   The pilot was also in contact with Tunisian authorities to find
out when the plane can return to Cairo, they said.
	   Libya has frequently violated the U.N. flight ban, which was
adopted in 1992 to force Libya to turn over two suspects wanted for
the bombing of an Pan Am jet over Scotland in 1988.
	   A Egyptian police official said the pilot was told by Egyptian
authorities that he could fly to Libya under duress without
violating sanctions, but the pilot apparently tricked the hijackers
and landed in Jerba.
	   Jerba, an island 350 kilometers (210 miles) south of the capital
Tunis, is frequently used as a transit point for travelers going on
to Libya by land without violating the sanctions.

<TEXT>
	   PATNA, India (AP) _ An oil tanker collided with a bus in an
eastern Indian town Wednesday, exploding in flames and burning to
death at least 50 bus passengers, officials said.
	   Police recovered 50 bodies and expected more victims, Bihar
state police chief V. Jacob said. The bus could accommodate 55
passengers, but several people were traveling on its roof.
	   The tanker driver and his assistant were hospitalized. Two bus
passengers with severed limbs and head injuries also were being
treated in a local hospital in Jagdishpur, a town 800 kilometers
(500 miles) southeast of New Delhi.
	   Local villagers watched helplessly as the blaze engulfed the bus
and the oil tanker in a flash. ``The fire was so fierce that we
couldn't do anything,'' Ram Babu Singh said.
	   ``Even four trees lining the road were burned down,'' said Lalji
Yadav, another passerby.
	   A fire engine from a nearby town reached the spot after
everything was over, Yadav said.
	   The relatives of the victims began arriving at the accident site
later Wednesday, but were shocked to find charred bodies.
	   The collision blocked the highway for nearly 10 hours.

</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Megret news conference

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A defiant Bruno Megret on Wednesday declared he
would never leave the National Front, and challenged the far-right
party's president to hold a national unity conference to sort out
their bitter divisions.
	   Megret, a longtime lieutenant of Le Pen who has become his
rival, was speaking publicly for the first time since tensions in
the party boiled over this weekend.
	   ``I will never leave the National Front, neither by resigning
nor by being pushed out,'' Megret said at a packed news conference.
	   ``The situation in the National Front is very serious,'' Megret
said. ``After the sanctions, the exclusions, the suspensions, the
firings, after the troubling comments...it is time to return to
peace and unity.''
	   He urged all the party's 50,000 or so members to approve the
holding of an urgent party congress in January.

Japan provides loan for Armenia's energy sector
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ Japan will provide dlrs 40 million in
loans to Armenia to help modernize power plants and energy systems
in this Caucasus Mountains nation, an official said Wednesday.
	   The money is part of a dlrs 200 billion package put together by
the World Bank for supporting Armenia's energy sector, said Igor
Ter-Kazarian, senior official at Armenia's Energy Ministry.
	   The Japanese loan is to be spent on replacing outdated equipment
at Armenia's non-nuclear power plants, and modernizing electricity
distribution systems, Ter-Kazarian said.
	   So far, Armenia has relied on its one nuclear power plant for 40
percent of its energy, but neighboring countries have complained
the plant may be unsafe.
	   The loan is for 30 years at a 1.8 percent annual interest rate,
Ter-Kazarian said.
	   Armenia has suffered severe hardships as a result of a conflict
with neighboring Azerbaijan over the disputed enclave of
Nagorno-Karabakh, and an ensuing trade embargo by Azerbaijan and
its ally Turkey.
	   Fuel and energy supplies in Armenia were critically low for a
number of years, but the situation has eased recently, in part
because Armenia has put the nuclear power plant into operation.
	   However, the country remains one of the highest recipients of
U.S. aid on a per capita basis, and a large portion of that money
is used to buy fuel.

Angolan government, rebels continue battle for highland towns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Government jets launched new air strikes
Wednesday on the central highland strongholds of the rebel group
UNITA, which said its forces had successfully repelled a five-day
ground offensive.
	   UNITA Secretary-General Paulo Lukamba Gato said his group's
forces drove back a major government attack that appeared to mark a
definitive end to the ailing 1994 peace pact. which halted a
two-decade civil war between the two sides.
	   ``They're bombing us but they're just destroying buildings, not
people,'' Gato said by satellite telephone.
	   Defense Ministry officials declined to comment on the reported
military activity around Andulo and Bailundo, rural towns about 290
kilometers (180 miles) southeast of Luanda where the UNITA
leadership lives.
	   Officials would say only that the area was ``an operational
zone'' and referred to a speech last Friday by President Jose
Eduardo dos Santos who called for the ``political and military
neutralization'' of UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi.
	   Western intelligence sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the two sides had been fighting around the two
towns since last Friday and that the military situation appeared
deadlocked.
	   UNITA claims the government deployed some 15,000 troops in a
pincer movement but that they were driven back by Savimbi's
so-called presidential guard, which is an elite force, and by local
militias.
	   Gato said the government troops had retreated to 60 kilometers
(40 miles) away from Andulo and 20 kilometers (12 miles) from
Bailundo. Gato said he was in Bailundo, though it was not possible
to confirm that.
	   The towns lie in mountainous terrain, with peaks of more than
2,000 meters (6,600 feet), and frequent mists and low cloud during
the current rainy season apparently have impeded larger-scale
strikes by the government air force. UNITA has no air power.
	   Intelligence sources said the outcome of the battle could hinge
on how long the government forces maintained their supply lines
from the capital intact.
	   ``Angola is a very big country and this is a very big offensive
by the government, but UNITA is very well equipped, so the next few
days will be crucial in seeing whether the army can sustain its
attack,'' a western official said on condition of anonymity.
	   The World Food Program office in Luanda reported that some 4,500
newly displaced people were converging on the city of Kuito, about
100 kilometers (60 miles) south of Andulo.
	   WFP delegations in 10 other cities around the country reported
no fighting, spokeswoman Jeanne Boistlair said by phone.
	   The fighting erupted after months of skirmishes and a bitter war
of words between the two sides.
	   The government accused UNITA of maintaining a hidden army in
breach of the peace accord, while the rebels accused the police and
army of human rights abuses.
	   The civil war began after the southwest African nation's 1975
independence from Portugal, and an estimated 500,000 people were
killed in the fighting.

PARIS: in January.

	   It did not seem likely, however, that Le Pen would agree to the
party congress. Le Pen is due to hold a news conference on Friday.
	   Megret insisted that his move was not aimed against Le Pen
personally.
	   ``If he sees this as a putsch, that is completely incorrect,''
Megret said.
	   Since the events of the past week, in which Le Pen dismissed
several Megret supporters, and one of his own loyalists, who spoke
against him, speculation has mounted that the National Front could
finally split over the bitter struggle.
	   Le Pen's daughter warned Megret in a newspaper interview
published Wednesday to back her father or leave the party.
	   ``Bruno Megret must disown the rebels and rejoin our cause or
face the consequences,'' Marine Le Pen told the daily Le Parisien.
	   A member of the party's central committee, Ms. Le Pen suggested
that Megret start his own party if he refuses to back down.
	   The virulently anti-immigrant National front has been widely
accused of racism and anti-Semitism.
	   Le Pen, 70, has been its absolute leader for a quarter-century.
But his increasingly public struggle with the quieter and pragmatic
_ though no less ideological _ Megret has weakened his hand.

Santer: EU budget revision must not hit poor members
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Commission President Jacques
Santer said Wednesday a new funding formula to facilitate the
European Union's eastward expansion must not be at the expense of
special aid for poor EU members.
	   In an appeal to Germany and others seeking to freeze outlays,
Santer said at a press conference the idea of rich members standing
by poorer ones was essential ``in a union based on the principle of
solidarity.''
	   The 15 EU governments disagree over how to finance the addition
of up to 12 nations to their club in the years ahead. The issue
will dominate a two-day summit opening Friday in Vienna, Austria.
	   The leaders will restate their wish to see Cyprus, 10 East
European neighbors and Malta join sometime, but will not fix entry
dates.
	   The summit comes three weeks before the launch of the single
European currency _ the most ambitious post-war European
integration project.
	   In a special ceremony, the leaders will pay tribute to Helmut
Kohl, hailing the former German leader as the driving force behind
the euro and declare him an Honorary Citizen of Europe.
	   The summit is unlikely to end months of deadlock over a spending
overhaul for the crucial 2000-2006 time span when the first
newcomers may enter the EU.
	   Germany, Britain, Austria, the Netherlands, Sweden and France
insist the EU's annual budget _ 86 billion European currency units
(dlrs 100 billion) this year _ must not rise beyond inflation.
	   They oppose a proposal to link spending to economic growth that
would raise the budget by 20 billion ecu (dlrs 23.6 billion) by
2006.
	   Spain, Greece, Ireland and Portugal _ the four countries who
receive most of the special economic aid from the EU _ want the
budget expanded so they don't lose out when even poorer east
European nations join.
	   Germany and other rich members say they pay far more into the EU
than they get back and want to limit their net contributions.
Germany's net payment is 22 billion marks (dlrs 13 billion) a year.
	   Germany takes over the EU presidency from Austria in January. It
has set a March deadline for a final agreement.
	   This fall, the EU opened membership negotiations with Cyprus,
Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia and Slovenia.
Preliminary talks were started with nations judged less-ready to
join _ Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria. Malta is
expected to join them.
	   Britain, Denmark and Austria have supported proposals in bring
Lithuania, Latvia and Slovakia into the first group. Germany and
France oppose.
	   Santer said the EU leaders are also expected to discuss plans to
reduce Europe's stubbornly high unemployment, and a plan to ensure
the 11 nations which adopt the euro on Jan. 1 will be able to speak
with a united voice in international finance meetings.

Five who killed British woman, child, sent for psychiatric tests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Dawid in graf 3 is cq
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A judge on Wednesday ordered that
five men who killed a British woman and her 4-year-old daughter
undergo psychological testing.
	   Judge Braam Lategan ordered the tests ahead of sentencing to
determine whether they can be declared dangerous criminals, which
would give the courts discretion to keep them in jail for life.
	   The five dubbed the ``Flower Gang,'' Dawid Ruiters, Andre
Solomons, Johannes Bruintjies, Charles Adams and Laston Chavula,
were convicted of murder on Monday.
	   They appeared cheerful in court as their relatives testified in
mitigation of a long sentence. But as Judge Lategan read out his
ruling and postponed the case until next year, they became
sullen-faced and Adams uttered an obscenity.
	   A panel of psychiatrists will report back to the court by Feb.
1, 1999. No sentencing date was set.
	   The gang attacked an isolated farm in the Northern Cape region
in 1996 where Julia Fairbank-Smith, 37, was staying with her
daughter Emma. Both were brutally killed as was the farm's owner,
Hendrina Louw, 57.
	   Fairbank-Smith was originally from Britain, but had moved to
South Africa and lived in Cape Town. Her relatives have urged the
court to impose life sentences.
	   Another guest, policeman Johan Viviers, survived the assault. He
woke up with a knife still lodged in his throat and staggered to
get help. Later in the trial, his evidence and identification of
the killers was to prove vital in securing a conviction.
	   The gang earned its nickname from the flowers that bloom once a
year each Northern Cape spring, turning the usually arid landscape
into a colorful garden and attracting thousands of tourists.
	   The attack occurred in September, which is spring in the
southern hemisphere.

with a daily output of 400,000 barrels after youths stormed the
facility, an oil company official said Wednesday.
	   Youths from the Ogulaga community in the southwestern Niger
delta region stormed the terminal Tuesday, Shell spokeswoman Olga
Hart said. She did not say if they had caused any damage.
	   Workers at the terminal had been evacuated, Hart said.
	   The youths were protesting because they said another oil
company, Mobil, had not fully paid a promised compensation package
after an enormous oil spill in January.
	   At least 1.6 million gallons leaked from the pipeline connecting
an offshore platform to a storage terminal in Nigeria's Akwa Ibom
state.
	   ``We are shocked at this invasion. Shell has nothing to do with
their problem,'' Hart said.
	   She said that if the problem was not resolved soon, it could
lead to production cuts.
	   Communities and youths in Nigeria's oil-rich delta region
regularly attack western oil firms, demanding they pay compensation
for environmental damage as a result of their operations there.
	   Nigeria is the world's sixth largest oil producer.

New German government boosts jobless spending
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Wednesday
proposed a rise in federal spending on jobs programs next year,
part of his center-left government's pledge to put Germany back to
work.
	   Schroeder's Cabinet approved a draft budget for labor market
measures including 41 billion marks (dlrs 24.5 billion) for jobs
programs in 1999, up from 37 billion marks this year, according to
Labor Ministry figures.
	   The measures include government-subsidized low-paid jobs as well
as make-work and training programs, which are a lifeline for many,
especially in former communist East Germany.
	   About a third of the increase would go for a new program to find
jobs or training positions for 100,000 young people, one of
Schroeder's campaign promises.
	   The spending plans are part of the 1999 federal budget, which
Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine is struggling to get ready to
present to parliament in February.
	   By making good on vote-winning promises to hike spending while
pledging to meet fiscal prudence goals demanded by the German
constitution, the 6-week-old government is already in a tight spot.
	   Next week, parliament is expected to give final approval to the
first step of the government's agenda _ a tax cut for low earners
and higher payments to families with children that will drain 7.8
billion marks (dlrs 4.7 billion) from federal coffers next year.
	   Schroeder, a Social Democrat, was elected in September on
promises to cut unemployment and bolster the social welfare state.
	   Some 3.95 million Germans were out of work in November, or 10.2
percent of the workforce.

Chinese, North Korean lifters break women's world records
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with men's records, medals &QL; 
 &UR; By THAKSINA KHAIKAEW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China set its third world weightlifting
record in three days at the Asian Games Wednesday, and North and
South Korean lifters set world marks too.
	   North Korean Ri Song Hui had to settle for a silver medal behind
China's Chen Yanqing in the women's 58-kilogram division despite
her record jerk.
	   With South Korean fans shouting, ``Fantastic! Fantastic,'' Kim
Hak-bong's world record jerk was just enough to boost him to gold
in the men's 69-kilogram class. His record lift of 195.0 kilograms
was five kilograms over the world standard set up as a basis for
records when weight classes were realigned.
	   After other Chinese women lifters had broken records on the two
previous nights of competition, Chen broke her own 8-month-old
record of 97.5 kilograms in the snatch, lifting 98.0.
	   She also beat the old record in the jerk with a lift of 123.5,
but North Korea's Ri grabbed away the record minutes later by
hoisting 125.0. China's Xu Xiongying had set the old world mark of
123.0 in May.
	   Chen won the gold with a total of 220.0 to 217.5 for Ri.
Thailand's Khassaraporn Suta took the bronze with 210.0.
	   Chen's first lift in the snatch was 95.0, and since weights are
supposed to be increased by 2.5 kilograms or multiples of that, her
lift of 98.0 was counted as 97.5 for the total. In the jerk, she
was given credit for just 122.5 instead of the 123.5 she actually
lifted.
	   That kept her from breaking the world mark of 220 for total.
	   ``I am very disappointed with the official marks they use for
judgment. I do not think it is right,'' Chen said.
	   As for quickly losing one world record to Ri, she said, ``I was
very surprised that the North Korean competitor could make it. She
was so fast and very impressive. However, I will try my best next
time in the World Championship.''
	   Thailand's team considered Khassaraporn its best hope for gold,
and she said, ``I apologize to Thai fans for this, but I tried my
best.''
	   Kim won gold with a total of 340.0, including a snatch of 145.0.
	   China's Wan Jianhui also had 340 _ a snatch of 155 and jerk of
185 _ but had to settle for silver because of heavier body weight.
	   North Korean Kim Myong Jung took the bronze with 312.5.
	   ``Unlucky, very unlucky,'' Wan said of his silver. ``I did not
expect that Kim could lift that much. It was impossible for any man
to increase by 15 kilograms at one time.''
	   Kim Hak-bong's last successful lift before his record 195 was
180.

Kosovo Albanians, Serbs agree: US peace plan unacceptable
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.S. envoy arriving in Kosovo, starting talks
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The U.S. envoy for Kosovo tried
Wednesday to breathe new life into the stalled peace process in the
strife-torn Serbian province.
	   Christopher Hill, who is also the U.S. ambassador to neighboring
Macedonia, arrived in Kosovo and began a series of talks with
representatives of pro-independence Kosovo Albanians, including an
expected meeting with the political representative for the ethnic
Albanian guerrillas.
	   The United States and its allies are urging the Serbs and ethnic
Albanians to compromise after both sides rejected Washington's
latest peace plan.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also criticized the
two sides, warning the Serbs to stop threats of new offensives and
telling the ethnic Albanians to abandon their ``rhetoric of
independence.''
	   Last week, Hill offered a revised formula for greater self-rule
for Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's Serb republic, with a
majority ethnic Albanian population.
	   Both sides rejected the formula. A Serbian negotiator, Ratko
Markovic, said Tuesday the U.S. draft would require
``reconstructing the whole of Yugoslavia'' and would pave the way
for independence for ethnic Albanians.
	   The chief ethnic Albanian negotiator, Fehmi Agani, said the
proposal favored the Serbs. And Adem Demaci, chief spokesman of the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, suggested Tuesday that Hill should be
replaced.
	   ``Mr. Hill either doesn't understand the Albanian problems, or
he is leaning toward the Serbs,'' Demaci said. ``The State
Department should reconsider the results of his work ... (and) send
us more qualified people.''
	   Although the KLA is not a party to the deliberations, its
support is considered critical to ensuring that any future plan
actually brings peace to the province, where ethnic Albanians
outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and almost 300,000 ethnic
Albanians forced from their homes in a seven-month crackdown on
separatists by Serbian forces before an October peace accord.
	   The accord, reached under threat of NATO airstrikes, was seen as
a way to buy time for a diplomatic solution acceptable to both
Serbs and ethnic Albanians. But with little sign of progress, fears
are mounting that full-scale fighting could erupt, perhaps in the
spring, when snows will melt along the mountain passes to Albania,
where the rebels maintain sanctuaries.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, NATO foreign ministers endorsed U.S.
diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis and called on Serbs and
ethnic Albanians to ``move rapidly in a spirit of compromise and
accommodation.''
	   The ministers endorsed a plan that would give Kosovo ``a
substantially greater degree of autonomy and meaningful
self-administration'' but said any settlement must respect the
territorial integrity of Yugoslavia _ putting them at odds with
ethnic Albanians seeking independence.
	   The Americans and Europeans fear independence would lead to
similar demands by other ethnic Albanian communities elsewhere in
the southern Balkans.
	   ``Both Serb and Albanian leaders have made public statements
that do not help the cause of peace,'' Albright told reporters in
Brussels. ``Serb threats to launch a renewed offensive in Kosovo
are dangerous and we view them with extreme seriousness.''
	   Albright also said the ``Kosovo Albanian insistence on rhetoric
of independence and rejection of the ... draft agreement do have
help us to move forward.''

Megret calls for national unity meeting; says he won't quit party
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Megret quotes; ADDS byline; edits slightly. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOCELYN NOVECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A defiant Bruno Megret on Wednesday declared he
would never leave the National Front, and challenged the far-right
party's president, Jean-Marie Le Pen, by demanding an emergency
party meeting to sort out their differences.
	   Megret, a longtime lieutenant of Le Pen who has become his
rival, was speaking publicly for the first time since tensions
between the two reached a boiling point this week.
	   ``I will never leave the National Front, neither by resigning
nor by being pushed out,'' Megret said at a packed news conference.
	   ``The situation in the National Front is very serious,'' Megret
said. ``It is time to return to peace and unity.''
	   He urged all the party's 50,000 or so members to approve the
holding of an urgent party congress in January.
	   It did not seem likely, however, that Le Pen would agree to the
party congress. Le Pen is due to hold a news conference on Friday.
	   Megret insisted that his move was not aimed against Le Pen
personally.
	   ``If he sees this as a putsch, that is completely incorrect,''
Megret said.
	   Asked whether the party congress would consider electing a new
president, Megret said only: ``I don't want to enter into those
considerations.''
	   Since the events of the past week, in which Le Pen dismissed
several Megret supporters, and one of his own loyalists, who spoke
against him, speculation has mounted that the National Front would
finally split over the bitter struggle. Some thought Megret might
announce his departure on Wednesday.
	   But Megret is betting that he has the support of the majority of
party members. He said Wednesday that party organizations in 11 out
of 22 regions supported his call for a congress.
	   The virulently anti-immigrant National front has been widely
accused of racism and anti-Semitism.
	   Le Pen, 70, has been its absolute leader for a quarter-century.
But his increasingly public struggle with the quieter and more
pragmatic _ though certainly no less ideological _ Megret has
weakened his hand.
	   Le Pen's daughter warned Megret in a newspaper interview
published Wednesday to back her father or leave the party.
	   ``Bruno Megret must disown the rebels and rejoin our cause or
face the consequences,'' Marine Le Pen told the daily Le Parisien.
	   A member of the party's central committee, Ms. Le Pen suggested
that Megret start his own party if he refuses to back down.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A woman in custody on suspicion of insurance fraud
was arrested Wednesday on murder and attempted murder charges in a
mass poisoning that killed four people in southwestern Japan.
	   Former insurance saleswoman Masumi Hayashi is suspected of
slipping arsenic into curry served at a July 25 community festival
that killed four people, including two children, and sickened 63
people.
	   The poisoning drew widespread attention in a society that boasts
relatively low crime. It also set off a spate of copycat crimes
with drinks at stores and in vending machines, including a can of
tea that killed a man.
	   Police said they suspect Hayashi acted alone, knowing that many
people would be hurt. They would not comment on a possible motive.
	   Some Japanese media reports say Hayashi wanted to collect
insurance money on several people who came to her home to gamble.
Others say she held a grudge against some residents.
	   Hayashi, 37, was already in jail on suspicion of serving
arsenic-laced meals to her husband and another man in 1997 in an
attempt to obtain their life insurance money.
	   In Japan, police can keep suspects in custody, arresting them
again and again on new charges, for up to 23 days per charge.
Hayashi has now been arrested four times, staring with her initial
Oct. 4 arrest.
	   The Hayashi case has also raised deep fears in Japan about fake
insurance policies. An official representing Japan's insurance
companies apologized in Parliament Wednesday for such fears.
	   Most Japanese criminal prosecutions are centered around
confessions, partly because there is no plea-bargaining. Police say
Hayashi has denied wrongdoing.
	   On Wednesday, Hayashi's lawyers asked the prosecution not to
force a confession out of their client.
	   ``The right to remain silent is an undoubted right recognized by
the Constitution,'' attorney Tsutomu Kobayashi was quoted by Kyodo
News service as saying.
	   Police would not elaborate, but they said in a nationally
televised news conference that they had ample evidence.
	   Witnesses saw Hayashi near the curry holding paper cups, and
police found arsenic in some paper cups near the scene, Japanese
media reports say.
	   Investigators have also found arsenic under a sink in Hayashi's
home and in about 10 other spots on her property in Wakayama, about
450 kilometers (280 miles) southwest of Tokyo.
	   Hayashi's husband, Kenji Hayashi, 53, was arrested Oct. 4 on
separate insurance fraud charges.

Russia has tough words for NATO despite warming relations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES throughout with fresh details, quotes. CHANGES

 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Russia, the superpower emeritus of
Europe, warned NATO Wednesday that as it develops its military and
political strategy for the 21st century it must recognize that the
ultimate authority for military action beyond its own borders is
the United Nations.
	   Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said since the creation of the
Russia-NATO Permanent Joint Council in 1996 the former enemies have
made great progress in dealing with their differences and finding
areas for cooperation.
	   ``We have come a long way from mistrust to mutual
understanding,'' he told reporters after a meeting of the Council.
But he made no secret that serious differences remain. For its
part, NATO believes that continuing to cooperate despite these
differences is proof of the Council's success.
	   ``Kosovo is a good example of that,'' said NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who told the allies
that Bosnia and Kosovo are prime examples of the kind of threats
that had to be faced outside NATO's borders, said it is only common
sense to deal with instability before it lands on the alliance's
doorstep.
	   The Russians vehemently disagreed with NATO's decision to
threaten the use of air strikes in Kosovo without a specific
mandate from the United Nations. At the same time, however, they
continued to work with the West to achieve a political solution and
are contributing to the task force of unarmed civilians who are now
patrolling the Serbian province and monitoring the cease-fire.
	   ``Any decision on the use of force in our view must only be
taken on the basis of Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter,'' Ivanov said.
	   The Russians have two fears. One is that if NATO continues to
act without a U.N. mandate it will effectively circumvent Russia's
veto on the Security Council. And secondly, if the world has
abandoned the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs
of countries, what standards will be used and who will apply them.
	   A number of the ministers explained to Ivanov at length the
reasoning behind NATO's action in Kosovo. They said there was no
attempt to circumvent the United Nations, but that when the U.N.
route became blocked, NATO had no choice but to act if it was to
avert a humanitarian disaster.
	   ``We did try very hard today to explain why the Russians should
not worry,'' said one participant in the meeting, who spoke on
condition he not be identified.
	   In Tuesday's meeting, foreign ministers began updating NATO's
strategic concept, the military and political doctrine that guides
the alliance. This strategy has in recent years turned away from
defense against a Russian onslaught in Central Europe to facing
such threats as regional conflicts, ethnic violence, terrorism and
weapons of mass destruction.
	   Russia is watching this process closely.
	   ``We cannot be indifferent to the plans and decisions taken by
NATO,'' said Ivanov. ``We've described our point of view on some
points that are being discussed now.''
	   He was adamant about the role of the United Nations.
	   ``The main decision-making body remains the United Nations,'' he
said. ``NATO should keep this in mind while discussing its
strategic concept.''
	   NATO continues to keep its forces on alert for intervention in
Kosovo should Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic abandon the
cease-fire.
	   ``Today, there is no threat of humanitarian catastrophe in
Kosovo,'' Ivanov said. ``As to (the NATO forces), our position has
not changed. The question now is in the dimension of political
negotiations.''
	   Earlier in the day Ivanov held separate talks with Albright.
	   At a news conference, Albright said the two had gone over a
series of bilateral issues, including Russia's cooperation with
Iran, ``of major concern to us,'' and the START II nuclear
disarmament treaty.
	   Russia's Communist-led parliament long has delayed ratification
of START II treaty, signed by the United States and Russia in 1993.
The treaty would halve their nuclear arsenals to about 3,000 to
3,500 warheads each.
	   Albright said the Russian minister had told her he expects the
Russian parliament to ratify START II by the end of December. The
U.S. Senate ratified the treaty in 1996.
	   ``I'm hoping that when I'm in Moscow at the end of January we
can begin the Start III talks,'' she said.

Foreign minister says Italy may try Kurdish rebel leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Trying to end an extradition battle with Turkey,
Italy's foreign minister said Wednesday that Italy itself might try
a Kurdish rebel leader.
	   Abdullah Ocalan, who was arrested in Rome last month, is accused
of crimes in both Turkey and Germany.
	   For the moment, Italy seems stuck with Ocalan, a controversial
figure both at home and abroad.
	   Italian law forbids extraditing suspects to countries where they
might face the death penalty, as Ocalan does in Turkey. And Germany
doesn't want to extradite Ocalan because it fears unrest among its
large Turkish immigrant population.
	   Italy and Germany have been studying the possibility of an
international tribunal to try Ocalan, but no such court now exists.
Another option would be trial in a neutral nation, something the
European Union has endorsed.
	   Speaking to the Senate, Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini on
Wednesday raised the possibility that Italy might try Ocalan on the
German charges, which include murder and arson.
	   ``Even though Turkey's first reaction was negative, we continue
to explore this avenue with Germany,'' Dini said.
	   Italy could conduct the trial according to a 1972 Council of
Europe protocol allowing for the transfer of trials from one member
nation to another, Dini said.
	   Ocalan heads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has been
fighting for Kurdish autonomy in southeast Turkey for 14 years.
	   He was arrested on the German warrant when he arrived in Rome
Nov. 12 using a false passport. A court later released him, but
ordered him to remain in Rome.
	   Ocalan has asked for political asylum but Italy appears unlikely
to grant it.
	   A French magistrate investigating alleged extortion attempts
against Kurds in France met with Ocalan for the second time this
week on Wednesday. One of Ocalan's lawyers later told the ANSA news
agency that Ocalan had declined to answer questions because he
views the French investigation as an attempt to smear the PKK.

Picasso show in Rome focuses on war and death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A show of 75 works by Picasso dominated by the
themes of war and death opens this week in Rome at the National
Gallery of Modern Art.
	   The exhibition covers the years 1937 to 1954, when the Spanish
artist was preoccupied by political issues. ``This is a wartime,
sad Picasso, mostly in black-and-white,'' museum official Sandra
Pinto said Wednesday.
	   The paintings include ``Massacre in Korea'' from the Picasso
Museum in Paris and ``Portrait of the Jaime Sabartes'' from the
Picasso Museum in Barcelona.
	   The show opens with two preliminary drawings for ``Guernica,''
the 1937 masterpiece inspired by the Spanish Civil War, on loan
from Madrid's Reina Sofia Museum. The museum also sent ``Crying
Woman with Handkerchief.''
	   The exhibit opens Dec. 12 and runs through March 15.

Albania's president rules out solution for Kosovo within Serbia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Albania's president said Wednesday the
status of Yugoslavia's restive province of Kosovo can't be
permanently settled as long as Kosovo remains within the
federation's main republic of Serbia.
	   However, Rexep Mejdani stopped short of suggesting a solution
for Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the
population.
	   Hundreds have died in clashes this year between Serb forces and
rebel ethnic Albanians seeking independence for Kosovo.
	   ``My opinion is that no solution within Serbia would help to
permanently solve the problem,'' Mejdani said when asked to comment
on international efforts to broker a deal between
independence-seeking Albanians and the government of Yugoslavian
President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Mejdani would not elaborate as to what status he would propose
for Kosovo, which had its autonomy stripped by Milosevic in 1989.
	   He added that the dispute over Kosovo must be solved within a
wider territorial framework, taking into consideration the
political realities of the Balkans.
	   Mejdani's comments came at the start of a two-day visit to
Bulgaria.
	   He also met with Bulgarian President Peter Stoyanov and signed
double taxation and cultural cooperation accords.
	   The two discussed plans to build road, railroad and oil pipeline
links between Bulgaria's Black Sea port of Burgas and Albania's
Adriatic port of Vlore. The routes would pass through Macedonia,
and are seen as a means of enhancing economic cooperation and
stability in the region.

Britain, Germany reject Europe-wide tax levels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain and Germany on Wednesday said they were
not considering creating a unified system of corporation tax across
Europe or ``harmonizing'' personal income tax in the European
Union.
	   Germany's finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine, had raised fears
Germany wanted to force Britain to raise its corporation tax levels
and increase other taxes in line with other EU states as part of
economic and monetary union.
	   But in a joint statement two days before a European summit,
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder said, ``At no stage have we considered measures to
harmonize personal income tax. This is not necessary for the
effective functioning of the single market and is inconsistent with
the principle of subsidiarity,'' a principle by which decisions are
taken at the level nearest to those affected.
	   A single currency, the euro, will be adopted in January by 11 of
the 15 EU countries. Britain says it will decide early next century
on whether to join the euro.
	   British tax rates are generally lower than those in the rest of
the EU, and the issue of harmonization is potentially Britain's
most serious dispute with its European partners since Blair's Labor
government came to power in May 1997.
	   ``We do not favor a unified European system of corporate
taxation,'' the two leaders said. ``We agree that further
consideration could be given to how harmful tax competition in the
area of corporate taxation might best be avoided. But we will not
support measures leading to a higher tax burden and jeopardizing
competitiveness and jobs in the EU.''
	   The statement also stressed that any tax changes to close
loopholes or end discrimination would have to pass a test of
competitiveness and their impact on jobs.
	   ``Discriminatory tax rules and practices should generally be
removed to prevent the distortion of competition within the EU,''
it said. ``Exceptions can be accepted if a member state can
demonstrate that this will damage the competitiveness of Europe
vis-a-vis the rest of the world.''
	   The only concession the statement made to greater coordination
of taxes across the EU was on environmental and health grounds on
goods such as alcohol, tobacco and fuel.
	   ``Where tax policy is used to support wider health and
environmental objectives, there may be advantages in coordinating
action across the EU,'' the two leaders said.
	   Blair flies to Vienna on Thursday for a dinner of socialist
heads of government. The two-day European Council summit, which
officially begins Friday, will concentrate on preparations for the
introduction of trading in the euro on Jan. 1.

EU takes Italy, Belgium and Finland to court over wild birds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission said Wednesday
it was taking legal action against Italy, Belgium and Finland over
their alleged failure to comply with regulations on the protection
of wild birds.
	   The Commission said it was hauling Belgium and Italy before at
the European Court of Justice, while Finland was sent an official
warning.
	   Last week the European Union's executive body asked the court to
impose daily fines on France for its failure to shorten the bird
hunting season in line with EU rules.
	   According to Commission statements, Belgium has failed to
implement EU legislation forbidding the sale of certain wild bird
products; Italy flaunts rules on the use of captured birds as
hunting decoys and Finland has not set up enough bird sancturaries.

U.N. team withdraws when refused entry to Baath party office
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.N. spokesman calling it a serious incident &QL; 
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ An Iraqi official refused to allow a U.N.
weapons inspection team into an office of the ruling Baath Party on
Wednesday unless it produced search papers, the official Iraqi News
Agency said. The U.N. team then turned back.
	   It was the first time a U.N. team was blocked from conducting a
search for banned weapons since Richard Butler, head of the U.N.
Special Commission that oversees the inspectors, announced earlier
this week that ``surprise'' inspections would resume on Tuesday.
	   ``Clearly we were blocked and we have the right to inspect any
time, any place, and the Iraqis blocked us,'' Ewen Buchanan,
spokesman for the inspectors in New York, said.
	   ``Clearly, that's serious,'' he told The Associated Press in a
telephone interview. He could not provide details.
	   Last month, a team was not allowed into a base run by Iranian
exiles, the Mujahedeen Khalq.
	   A U.N. team tried to get into a headquarters of the party of
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein at about 9 a.m. (0600 gmt) ``in a
surprising and provocative manner,'' the agency said, quoting Gen.
Hossam Mohammed Amin, head of the National Monitoring Directorate
that provides escorts to the U.N. inspectors.
	   The Baath party official in charge of the headquarters demanded
that the head of the U.N. team give him a written declaration ``on
the material and items'' they sought, Amin said.
	   ``The team rejected this request and withdrew from the site,''
he was quoted as saying.
	   Amin said the behavior of the teams ``has the clear goal of
creating crises and problems.''
	   Buchanan, the U.N. spokesman, said he did not know whether the
inspectors would try to enter the site again but said the
inspections planned this week would continue.

Iran to test surface-to-surface missiles in war games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran will test fire surface-to-surface
missiles during the last stage of its naval war games, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency said Wednesday.
	   The neighboring Gulf states have been informed of the tests, the
agency said, quoting Issa Golverdi, the maneuvers' spokesman.
	   IRNA did not say what missiles would be fired.
	   Last September, Iran unveiled the Shahab-3 missile during a
military parade. The newly developed weapon, believed based on
North Korean technology, has a range of 1,300 kilometers (800
miles).
	   The agency did not say when the missile testing would take
place. The maneuvers began last Friday.
	   Golverdi said informing nearby Gulf Arab countries of how the
maneuvers were being held and inviting Oman to send military
observers was proof of Iran's goodwill towards it neighbors.
	   He said the best achievement of the games was that Iranian and
Omani military personnel became acquainted with each other, IRNA
said.
	   The exercises kicked off with a six-gun salute ``as a sign of
respect, peace and friendship'' between Iran and the six Gulf Arab
countries, Golverdi said.
	   Iran has tried for a decade to conduct joint military exercises
with Gulf states, which are allies of the United States. But so
far, no Gulf country has agreed because of Tehran's insistence that
U.S. warships leave the region.
	   Iran's naval forces and its elite Revolutionary Guards are
participating in the exercises, which began with defensive
amphibious operations and the shelling of targets by warships and
air force fighter-bombers.
	   The 50,000 forces taking part in the maneuvers, code-named Unity
77, also practiced mine-laying, mine-sweeping, chemical attack
scenarios and air defense tactics.
	   Some 160 naval vessels, including submarines, and 120 aircraft
are taking part in the maneuvers, which extend from the central
Gulf to the Strait of Hormuz and into the Gulf of Oman.
	   An Iranian military official told The Associated Press that
during the games, an electronic warfare system capable of jamming
enemy radar also would be tested.

Kosovo Albanians, Serbs agree: US peace plan unacceptable
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.S. envoy arriving in Kosovo, starting talks
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The U.S. envoy for Kosovo tried
Wednesday to breathe new life into the stalled peace process in the
strife-torn Serbian province.
	   Christopher Hill, who is also the U.S. ambassador to neighboring
Macedonia, arrived in Kosovo and began a series of talks with
representatives of pro-independence Kosovo Albanians, including an
expected meeting with the political representative for the ethnic
Albanian guerrillas.
	   The United States and its allies are urging the Serbs and ethnic
Albanians to compromise after both sides rejected Washington's
latest peace plan.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also criticized the
two sides, warning the Serbs to stop threats of new offensives and
telling the ethnic Albanians to abandon their ``rhetoric of
independence.''
	   Last week, Hill offered a revised formula for greater self-rule
for Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's Serb republic, with a
majority ethnic Albanian population.
	   Both sides rejected the formula. A Serbian negotiator, Ratko
Markovic, said Tuesday the U.S. draft would require
``reconstructing the whole of Yugoslavia'' and would pave the way
for independence for ethnic Albanians.
	   The chief ethnic Albanian negotiator, Fehmi Agani, said the
proposal favored the Serbs. And Adem Demaci, chief spokesman of the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, suggested Tuesday that Hill should be
replaced.
	   ``Mr. Hill either doesn't understand the Albanian problems, or
he is leaning toward the Serbs,'' Demaci said. ``The State
Department should reconsider the results of his work ... (and) send
us more qualified people.''
	   Although the KLA is not a party to the deliberations, its
support is considered critical to ensuring that any future plan
actually brings peace to the province, where ethnic Albanians
outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and almost 300,000 ethnic
Albanians forced from their homes in a seven-month crackdown on
separatists by Serbian forces before an October peace accord.
	   The accord, reached under threat of NATO airstrikes, was seen as
a way to buy time for a diplomatic solution acceptable to both
Serbs and ethnic Albanians. But with little sign of progress, fears
are mounting that full-scale fighting could erupt, perhaps in the
spring, when snows will melt along the mountain passes to Albania,
where the rebels maintain sanctuaries.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, NATO foreign ministers endorsed U.S.
diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis and called on Serbs and
ethnic Albanians to ``move rapidly in a spirit of compromise and
accommodation.''
	   The ministers endorsed a plan that would give Kosovo ``a
substantially greater degree of autonomy and meaningful
self-administration'' but said any settlement must respect the
territorial integrity of Yugoslavia _ putting them at odds with
ethnic Albanians seeking independence.
	   The Americans and Europeans fear independence would lead to
similar demands by other ethnic Albanian communities elsewhere in
the southern Balkans.
	   ``Both Serb and Albanian leaders have made public statements
that do not help the cause of peace,'' Albright told reporters in
Brussels. ``Serb threats to launch a renewed offensive in Kosovo
are dangerous and we view them with extreme seriousness.''
	   Albright also said the ``Kosovo Albanian insistence on rhetoric
of independence and rejection of the ... draft agreement do have
help us to move forward.''

Japan provides loan for Armenia's energy sector
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ Japan will provide dlrs 40 million in
loans to Armenia to help modernize power plants and energy systems
in this Caucasus Mountains nation, an official said Wednesday.
	   The money is part of a dlrs 200 billion package put together by
the World Bank for supporting Armenia's energy sector, said Igor
Ter-Kazarian, senior official at Armenia's Energy Ministry.
	   The Japanese loan is to be spent on replacing outdated equipment
at Armenia's non-nuclear power plants, and modernizing electricity
distribution systems, Ter-Kazarian said.
	   So far, Armenia has relied on its one nuclear power plant for 40
percent of its energy, but neighboring countries have complained
the plant may be unsafe.
	   The loan is for 30 years at a 1.8 percent annual interest rate,
Ter-Kazarian said.
	   Armenia has suffered severe hardships as a result of a conflict
with neighboring Azerbaijan over the disputed enclave of
Nagorno-Karabakh, and an ensuing trade embargo by Azerbaijan and
its ally Turkey.
	   Fuel and energy supplies in Armenia were critically low for a
number of years, but the situation has eased recently, in part
because Armenia has put the nuclear power plant into operation.
	   However, the country remains one of the highest recipients of
U.S. aid on a per capita basis, and a large portion of that money
is used to buy fuel.

Strikers close Paris' Louvre and Grand Palais museums
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Striking employees on Wednesday barred visitors
from entering two of Paris' most well known art museums _ the
Louvre and the Grand Palais.
	   The workers are demanding the museums hire more personnel and
improve working conditions, said a Louvre spokeswoman, Patricia
Mounier.
	   Negotiations will continue this afternoon and a conclusion seems
imminent, she said.
	   The employees on strike are those who divide their work
schedules between the Louvre and the Grand Palais exposition hall,
currently displaying the works of painter Gustave Moreau.
	   The strikes are the latest in a wave of walkouts that have
closed major Paris attractions recently, including the Eiffel Tower
and the National Library.
	   The Orsay Museum turned away frustrated visitors for two weeks
in November as museum workers waged a strike during a hugely
popular exposition of the works of Jean-Francois Millet and Vincent
Van Gogh.

South Korea beats Japan 13-8 in slugfest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ South Korea outmuscled Japan 13-8
Wednesday in an Asian Games baseball slugfest with 10 home runs _
and seven Major League scouts watching.
	   Korean batters hit three home runs in a row in the eighth inning
to break an 8-8 tie.
	   A vociferous contingent of fans cheered on the winners with
drums, flags and organized yells.
	   The Major League scouts who came with speed guns, looking for
pitching prospects, saw the pitchers shelled with six homers by
South Korea and four by Japan.
	   The first inning provided no hint of the slugfest to follow as
Japanese pitcher Hideo Tamura struck out the South Korean side. The
Japanese also went down 1-2-3 in the first.
	   Trailing 6-2, Japan exploded for five runs in the fifth starting
with Mitsutaka Goto's lead-off home run. After two outs, Teimii
Keenan hit a two-run blast and Shinnosuke Abe also homered with a
man on.
	   From 8-8, South Korea exploded for five runs.
	   A single and a hit batter put two on and Kim Dong-joo drove them
all in with a homer. Solo homers by Kang Hyuk and Back Jae-ho
followed.
	   Kim also homered in the third and Keenan had a solo shot in the
seventh.

Namibian military confirms casualties in Congo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ Two Namibian soldiers died and seven
were wounded in fighting in eastern Congo over the weekend, the
Namibian Defense Force said Wednesday.
	   The officially reported death toll now stands at four, including
one malaria victim, since Namibia entered Congo's civil war on the
side of President Laurent Kabila.
	   The Namibian, an independent daily, reported Wednesday that the
casualties occurred during heavy shelling by rebels in a battle to
seize control of the town of Moba.
	   Military spokesman Elvis Nashilongo declined to comment on the
report.
	   The newspaper named the deceased as Simion Shetunyanga, 38, and
Asia Wakotora Katjimune, 21.
	   The seven wounded men are being treated at a state hospital in
Windhoek for shrapnel wounds, a doctor said on condition of
anonymity.
	   Namibia's involvement in the Congo conflict has come under
increasing criticism at home.

Lithuanian parliament speaker calls for restricting ex-communists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ Parliament speaker Vytautas
Landsbergis has introduced a bill to ban ex-Communists from serving
in high-level government positions.
	   Landsbergis, a top leader of the drive for independence from the
Soviet Union, succeeded this year in passing a bill banning ex-KGB
members from many public and private-sector jobs, but the measure
was vetoed by President Valdas Adamkus, who says Lithuanians must
start abandoning resentments brewed in their troubled past.
	   The law, submitted on Tuesday, would prevent ex-Communists from
serving in parliament, national government and a wide range of
other official posts.
	   The ban would not apply to current members of parliament or
government, and it would only remain in effect for five years.
	   Landbergis was quoted by the Baltic News Service as saying the
law was needed to set the historical record straight about abuses
during the Communist era.
	   But a top opposition politician, Ceslovas Jursenas,
characterized the bill as unconstitutional and ``an act of
revenge,'' BNS said.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A U.N. weapons inspection team turned back
from a suprise visit to an office of Iraq's ruling party on
Wednesday when an official demanded it produce search papers, the
official Iraqi News Agency said.
	   It was the first time a U.N. team was blocked from searching for
banned weapons since Richard Butler, head of the U.N. Special
Commission that oversees the inspectors, announced earlier this
week that surprise inspections would resume Tuesday.
	   A U.N. team tried on Wednesday morning to get into an office of
the party of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein ``in a surprising and
provocative manner,'' the agency said, quoting Gen. Hossam Mohammed
Amin, head of the National Monitoring Directorate that provides
escorts to the U.N. inspectors.
	   The Baath party official in charge of the headquarters demanded
that the head of the U.N. team give him a written declaration ``on
the material and items'' they sought, Amin said.
	   ``The team rejected this request and withdrew from the site,''
he was quoted as saying.
	   Amin said the behavior of the teams ``has the clear goal of
creating crises and problems.''
	   The exact location of the Baghdad office involved in Wednesday's
incident was not immediately known.
	   The U.N. Special Commission here said the U.N. headquarters in
New York asked that spokeswoman Caroline Cross make no comment on
the incident.
	   The incident occurred as nearly 200 U.N. inspectors searched for
banned weapons in Iraq. Cross said all the U.N. arms experts in the
country were working Wednesday.
	   Cross said the 130-140 inspectors on regular teams were working
as well as some visiting experts. She would not give the exact
number involved but said it was ``a little less than 200.''
	   When asked if they would be carrying out surprise visits, she
said only the ``inspectors will carry on a full range of activities
in Iraq.''
	   Unannounced visits in the past have been a major source of
friction with Iraq.
	   On Tuesday, nine arms monitoring groups, two biological warfare
teams and a missile unit conducted 32 searches, some using
helicopters, INA said.
	   Among the sites visited Tuesday were barracks of the Republican
Guards in Baghdad suburbs and army depots in and around the
capital, the London-based Al-Hayat newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Iraqi newspapers, meanwhile, carried further accounts of
comments by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz in Moscow in which he
said there is a limit to Iraq's cooperation with the United Nations
in the search for weapons of mass destruction.
	   State-run newspapers first quoted Aziz's statements on his
Russian trip Tuesday. ``This situation is no longer acceptable,''
Aziz said, referring to the U.N. sanctions that have blocked free
export of Iraq's oil.
	   The Special Commission must certify Iraq has eliminated its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons as well as long-range
missiles before the sanctions can be lifted.
	   The sanctions, imposed after the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait,
have devastated Iraq's oil-based economy, and Iraqi officials have
long insisted they have fulfilled their obligations under U.N.
resolutions and that the sanctions should be lifted.
	   The arms inspectors _ who insist Iraq could still be hiding
weapons _ have been a constant source of confrontation between Iraq
and the United Nations.
	   In the latest flare-up, Iraq blocked surprise visits by the
inspectors for three months. They were only allowed to return in
mid-November under threat of U.S. and British air strikes to force
compliance.
	   On Wednesday, the Iraqi press praised U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan's statement that a military attack against any country
must have approval of the Security Council.
	   Babil, the newspaper owned by Saddam's son Odai, said Annan's
speech to the French Parliament on Tuesday means that ``the United
States must realize its days of domination are numbered now.''
	   In an apparent reference to NATO, Annan said that regional
organizations have an important world role, but ``any military
intervention by the international community must be approved by the
Security Council.''
	   However, in an interview published Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said the NATO alliance ``cannot be hostage
of a veto of this or that country against an operation.''
	   ``Because in such a case,'' she told the French daily Le Monde,
``NATO would be nothing more than a branch of the United Nations.''

Kosovo Albanians, Serbs agree: US peace plan unacceptable
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 5 grafs to UPDATE with U.S. envoy arriving in
Kosovo for new talks. Picks up 6th graf pvs, ``The chief...'' &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The United States and its allies are
urging both sides in Kosovo to compromise, after Serbs and ethnic
Albanians rejected Washington's latest formula for bringing peace
to the troubled province.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill arrived today for a series of talks
with representatives of pro-independence Kosovo Albanians,
including an expected meeting with the political representative for
the ethnic Albanian guerrillas.
	   He came after Secretary of State Madeleine Albright criticized
the two sides, warning the Serbs to stop threats of new offensives
and telling the ethnic Albanians to abandon their ``rhetoric of
independence.''
	   Last week, Hill offered a revised U.S. formula for greater
self-rule for Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's Serb republic but
with a majority ethnic Albanian population.
	   But both sides rejected the formula. A Serbian negotiator, Ratko
Markovic, said Tuesday the U.S. draft would require
``reconstructing the whole of Yugoslavia'' and would pave the way
for independence for the majority ethnic Albanian province.
	   The chief ethnic Albanian negotiator, Fehmi Agani, said it
favored the Serbs. And Adem Demaci, chief spokesman for the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army, suggested that Hill should be replaced.
	   ``Mr. Hill either doesn't understand the Albanian problems, or
he is leaning toward the Serbs,'' Demaci said. ``The State
Department should reconsider the results of his work ... (and) send
us more qualified people.''
	   Although the KLA rebels are not a party to the deliberations,
their support is considered critical to ensuring that any future
plan actually brings peace to the province, where ethnic Albanians
outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and almost 300,000 ethnic
Albanians forced from their homes in a seven-month crackdown on
separatists by Serbian forces. An October peace accord halted most
of the fighting.
	   The accord, reached under threat of NATO airstrikes, was seen as
a way to buy time to find a diplomatic solution. But with little
sign of progress, fears are mounting that full-scale fighting could
erupt with warmer weather in the spring.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, NATO foreign ministers endorsed U.S.
diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis and called on Serbs and
ethnic Albanians to ``move rapidly in a spirit of compromise and
accommodation.''
	   The ministers on Tuesday endorsed a plan that would give Kosovo
``a substantially greater degree of autonomy and meaningful
self-administration'' but said any settlement must respect the
territorial integrity of Yugoslavia.
	   The Americans and Europeans fear independence would lead to
similar demands by other ethnic Albanian communities elsewhere in
the southern Balkans.
	   ``Both Serb and Albanian leaders have made public statements
that do not help the cause of peace,'' Albright told reporters in
Brussels. ``Serb threats to launch a renewed offensive in Kosovo
are dangerous and we view them with extreme seriousness.''
	   Albright also said the ``Kosovo Albanian insistence on rhetoric
of independence and rejection of the ... draft agreement do not
help us to move forward.''

Libyan passengers commandeer Egyptian airliner in air drama
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with police saying all passengers have left the plane;
other details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan passengers rioted aboard a chartered
Egyptian airliner and demanded that the plane fly to Libya in
violation of U.N. sanctions, police said. But the pilot tricked
them and landed in neighboring Tunisia.
	   Egyptian airport police officials said all passengers later left
the plane, ending the 15-hour crisis that began while the plane was
flying from Yemen to Tunis, Tunisia.
	   The plane, however, landed in Jerba, a Tunisian island about 80
kilometers (50 miles) from Libya's northwest border, an airport
official in Jerba said, insisting his name not be used.
	   About 150 Libyans were aboard the MD-90 aircraft, which was
chartered by a private Egyptian company for a flight by Libyan
businessmen, the officials said. They spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   They said the aircraft itself belongs to EgyptAir, the national
carrier, and that Tunisian and Yemeni passengers also were aboard.
	   Soon after the plane took off, two masked passengers entered the
cockpit and demanded to go to the Libyan capital Tripoli. Then,
they said, a large group of other passengers joined in the demand.
	   None of the passengers or crew was reported injured. Officials
said many of the passengers were carrying daggers, as is the custom
among Libyan and Yemeni men, but that they did not use them to
threaten the crew.
	   It was unclear whether the masked men used daggers in the
cockpit or if the passengers overwhelmed the pilot by force of
numbers before he managed to land in Jerba.
	   In Jerba, some passengers left the plane complaining of
exhaustion while many others remained on board demanding that the
aircraft be refueled, the Egyptian officials said. But all
remaining passengers also left the aircraft later, said the
officials.
	   It was not clear if any of them had been taken into custody at
the airport where they were apparently holed up.
	   The Egyptian officials were apparently getting their information
from Tunisian authorities and the pilot who was in touch with Egypt
by radio.
	   The pilot was also in contact with Tunisian authorities to find
out when the plane can return to Cairo, they said.
	   Libya has frequently violated the U.N. flight ban, which was
adopted in 1992 to force Libya to turn over two suspects wanted for
the bombing of a Pan Am jet over Scotland in 1988.
	   A Egyptian police official said the pilot was told by Egyptian
authorities that he could fly to Libya under duress without
violating sanctions, but the pilot apparently tricked the hijackers
and landed in Jerba.
	   Jerba, an island 350 kilometers (210 miles) south of the capital
Tunis, is frequently used as a transit point for travelers going on
to Libya by land without violating the sanctions.

Trial of American-born Palestinian begins

<TEXT>
	   BEIT EL, West Bank (AP) _ An 18-year-old American-born
Palestinian charged with membership in an Islamic militant group
went on trial Wednesday in an Israeli military court.
	   Hashem Mufleh, who has lived with his mother for 16 years in the
Palestinian-run West Bank city of Ramallah, was arrested in August
by Israel as he tried to board a flight to the United States to
attend college in Gallup, New Mexico, where his father lives.
	   He is accused of membership in Hamas, throwing a stone and other
objects at moving Israeli vehicles, distributing Hamas leaflets and
participating in a demonstration commemorating Hamas bomb-maker
Mohyedin Sharif, who was killed in an explosion earlier this year.
	   Two Israeli policemen testified Wednesday at an Israeli military
court in Beit El that Mufleh had confessed of his own free will.
	   However Mufleh's attorney Jonathan Kuttab said ``The evidence
rests entirely on a confession extracted under torture.''
	   Moshe Levy, a police officer who took down Mufleh's statement
after he was questioned by interrogators from Israel's Shin Bet
security agency, said Mufleh did not appear to have been
ill-treated. ``As far as I remember he looked fine. I don't
remember seeing any marks on him,'' Levy told the court.
	   Wearing a Miami Dolphins T-shirt, glasses, and dark Nike
basketball shoes, Mufleh counted Muslim prayer beads as he listened
to the Arabic translation of the proceedings, which were conducted
in Hebrew.
	   ``I'm not involved with Hamas. I'm religious. I'm a Muslim,'' he
told The Associated Press.
	   His mother, Itaf Mufleh said ``He studied the Koran and prayer.
Does that mean he belongs to Hamas?''
	   Kuttab argued that the Mufleh's actions would have been legal in
the United States and would be protected by the First Amendment.
	   Kuttab's request to release his client on bail was denied two
weeks ago by a military judge.
	   A few days after Mufleh's arrest, the U.S. State Department
protested his detention, his interrogation and the conditions under
which he was being kept. His family said that because of the
intervention of U.S. officials in Israel, Mufleh's prison
conditions have improved.
	   Last month several Arab American and human rights groups
launched a campaign to press for Mufleh's release.

Thousands of travelers stranded by minibus strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEORGE MWANGI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A strike by private minibus drivers left
thousands of commuters stranded in downtown Nairobi Wednesday as
operators of the main mode of public transportation protested new
traffic regulations.
	   The privately-owned vans, known as ``matatus'', operate
transport throughout Kenya and provide an estimated 70 percent of
passanger transport in the capital Nairobi.
	   Last week, the Nairobi Provincial Commissioner Joseph Kaguthi
said the new regulations aimed at disciplining the animated, but
often reckless drivers and conductors, would take effect this week.
	   The regulations call for all matatus to remove music systems
from the vehicles, for each driver to have and maintain a
certificate of good conduct renewable every three months, and
insist the often multi-colored vans be painted in a single color.
	   In defiant protest, the matatus cruised downtown Nairobi in a
convoy Wednesday, playing loud music but refusing to pick up
passengers.
	   The conductors, known as touts who are often seen hanging out
the side door of the vans to solicit business, waved twigs out the
doors and shouted ``Kaguthi must go.''
	   Police deployed at the main downtown traffic circles to ensure
the matatus did not disrupt traffic.
	   Nairobi matatus are notorious for overloading the vans, driving
recklessly, playing loud music and obstructing traffic as they
aggressively compete for passengers.
	   The alternate means of public transport in Nairobi, the Kenya
Bus Service, runs a fleet of 191 buses, does not have capacity for
the capital's more than two million residents.
	   ``The country has a lot of problems, people are stealing
millions and nobody asks them. Is having several colors on a matatu
really a priority?'' said John Kamau, one of the drivers.
	   He said the drivers and touts were not objecting so much to the
new regulations as to the short time frame given them to make the
changes.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Oil Minister Hamdy el-Banbi on Wednesday
said the recent crisis over U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq _
which had the United States and Britain threatening military
strikes _ was ``directly responsible'' for gyrations in the price
of oil.
	   He said that during the crisis, countries hoarded oil, only to
discover when the crisis was over that they had surpluses.
	   ``This led to an increase of the oil offered on the market,''
suppressing prices, he said in comments carried by Egypt's Middle
East News Agency.
	   But el-Banbi also said he was optimistic oil prices would firm
because of harsh winter weather in Europe and signs of improvement
in Asian economies.
	   The last crisis over U.N. weapons inspections ended Nov. 14 when
Iraq pledged to renew cooperation with the inspectors, who oversee
the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.

Russian agents detain man suspected of plotting to kill Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian security agents have arrested a man
suspected of preparing an assassination attempt on President Boris
Yeltsin, news reports said Wednesday.
	   The 29-year-old resident of the Volga River city of Saratov,
whose identity was withheld, also allegedly plotted to kill the
regional governor, Dmitry Ayatskov.
	   The unemployed man is an ex-convict with a record of mental
illness, the Federal Security Service (FSB) said, according to the
Interfax news agency. The FSB is the main successor to the Soviet
KGB.
	   The suspect, who had actively attended rallies and other events
organized by the local Communist Party branch, was arrested after
he had started calling on other hard-liners to attack Yeltsin and
other officials, the business daily Kommersant reported Wednesday.
	   During a search of his apartment, security agents found notes
outlining the man's plan of action, including attacks on police to
seize weapons, bombings of apartment buildings and taking local
officials hostage.
	   No weapons or explosives were found in his apartment.
	   If convicted of plotting to kill Yeltsin and other officials,
the man may face a life prison sentence.
	   Kommersant, however, voiced skepticism about the arrest, saying
the case was probably blown out of proportion by the FSB, which has
come under strong public criticism recently.
	   Boris Berezovsky, a controversial Russian business tycoon with
close Kremlin links, has accused FSB leadership of issuing an order
to kill him. Several FSB officers have accused their bosses of
ordering contract killings, extortion and other crimes.
	   ``By exposing a plot against Yeltsin and Ayatskov, the FSB is
trying to divert public attention from the scandal,'' Kommersant
said.
	   Last month, a Russian man blew up his car just outside the
Kremlin gates, wounding three guards. It was not clear whether he
was targeting Yeltsin, who was out of town when the attack
happened. The man is in prison awaiting trial.

Lithuanian parliament speaker calls for restricting ex-communists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ Parliament speaker Vytautas
Landsbergis has introduced a bill to ban former Communists from
serving in high-level government positions.
	   Landsbergis, a top leader of the drive for independence from the
Soviet Union, succeeded this year in passing a bill banning ex-KGB
members from many public and private-sector jobs, but the measure
was vetoed by President Valdas Adamkus, who says Lithuanians must
start abandoning resentments brewed in their troubled past.
	   The law, submitted on Tuesday, would prevent ex-Communists from
serving in parliament, national government and a wide range of
other official posts.
	   The ban would not apply to current members of parliament or
government, and it would only remain in effect for five years.
	   Landbergis was quoted by the Baltic News Service as saying the
law was needed to set the historical record straight about abuses
during the Communist era.
	   But a top opposition politician, Ceslovas Jursenas,
characterized the bill as unconstitutional and ``an act of
revenge,'' BNS said.

Comoros leaders appealing to African countries for intervention
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ The leaders of the Indian Ocean
nation of Comoros have asked African countries to intervene in
secessionist violence that has killed dozens of people in recent
days, the chief of the Organization of African Unity said
Wednesday.
	   A decision on whether to intervene militarily would be made
after an OAU delegation returns from the island chain later this
week, OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim told reporters.
	   ``The use of force is the last possible consideration,'' Salim
said.
	   Salim said many people have been killed or injured and thousands
more displaced in the violence that began on the Comoran island of
Anjouan on Saturday. He gave no specifics.
	   Reports from Anjouan have been sketchy. Fighting between rival
groups in the separatist island erupted Saturday. Some sources said
between 30 and 40 people had been killed.
	   ``What has disturbed us is the extent of the violence that has
taken place, the extent of casualties inflicted on ordinary people,
and the extent of polarisation which has taken place on the
island,'' Salim said.
	   The OAU mission left for Moroni, the capital of the Comoros and
located on Grande Comore island, on Wednesday. The mission,
comprising about 10 military and security officials from Kenya,
Mauritius, Mozambique, Tanzania and South Africa, was expected to
return to South Africa by Friday.
	   On their return, the delegation would report back to South
Africa, the coordinator of efforts to secure peace in the Comoros.
South Africa, in turn, would make recommendations to the OAU, after
which African leaders would decide what action to take.
	   Salim said the OAU received a number of appeals for intervention
from the Comoran government, including the country's interim
President Tadjiddine Ben Said Massonde and Prime Minister Abbas
Djousof.
	   Anjouan declared independence from Comoros on Aug. 3, 1997. The
government on Grand Comore sent troops to the breakaway island a
month later in an abortive attempt to put down the secession.

Sinn Fein says Trimble has `dismally failed' leading peace process
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Peace-Nobel &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A leading member of the Sinn Fein party on
Wednesday accused Protestant politician David Trimble, who shared
this year's Nobel Peace Prize, of provoking a crisis in the
Northern Ireland peace agreement.
	   Martin McGuinness, speaking outside the official 10 Downing St.
residence of British Prime Minister Tony Blair, said the Ulster
Unionist Party leader was using the Irish Republican Army's
determination to retain its massive weapons stockpiles as ``an
issue to beat Sinn Fein over the head with.''
	   McGuinness, whom the history books credit as a former
chief-of-staff of the outlawed IRA, insisted after his talks with
Blair that April's accord made no linkage between disarmament and
the right of his IRA-allied party to participate in a new
multi-party administration for Northern Ireland.
	   Sinn Fein had both expected the administration to be formed by
October. But Trimble, chief representative of Northern Ireland's
British Protestant majority, has consistently argued that
Protestant politicians won't accept any role for Sinn Fein unless
the IRA backs up its 16-month truce by starting to disarm.
	   The peace agreement empowered a commission to seek the gradual
disarmament of the IRA and the province's outlawed pro-British
paramilitary groups, a process supposed to be completed by May
2000.
	   McGuinness was appointed in September to shuttle between the
commission and the IRA, but the outlawed group's command has
emphasized they won't throw away a single bullet or detonator.
	   McGuinness said Trimble should ``recognize that his job is the
implementation of the agreement, which he has dismally failed to do
over the course of the last seven months.''
	   But Seamus Mallon, the Catholic appointed to work alongside
Trimble in forming the new government, chided McGuinness for
suggesting that the accord didn't commit Sinn Fein to seek IRA
disarmament ``with urgency.''
	   Mallon, also speaking outside 10 Downing St. after a separate
meeting with Blair, said Sinn Fein should ``concentrate more on
what contribution they could make to the resolution'' of the
disarmament issue, ``rather than affixing blame to every other
party.''
	   Trimble and John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labor
Party that most of the province's Catholics support, arrived
Wednesday in Oslo in advance of Thursday's joint conferring of the
Nobel Peace Prize.

Portuguese police arrest four for allegedly drug-related
</HEADLINE>
kidnapping &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal _ Portuguese police arrested three Spaniards
and a Colombian, all allegedly linked to drug trafficking, during
an operation to free a kidnapped Spaniard, a police statement said
Wednesday.
	   Spanish police have also detained two men in connection with the
kidnapping of Jose Luis Gomez, the private Spanish news agency
Europa Press said.
	   Gomez was abducted Saturday in the northwestern Spanish province
of Pontevedra and taken over the border to a safehouse in Portugal
from where he was freed on Monday.
	   Portuguese police found the kidnap victim gagged, chained and
handcuffed to the stairs of a house in the northern town of Seixas,
12 kilometers (7.5 miles) from the border with Spain, Wednesday's
police statement said.
	   Transported in the boot of his own vehicle, Gomez had used his
mobile phone to give police rough indications of where he was being
taken, Europa Press said.
	   The motive behind the kidnapping was believed to be
drug-trafficking, and police also seized documents and weapons
during the operation that included arrests in Estoril, on the
outskirts of Lisbon, as well as in Seixas, the Portuguese police
statement said.
	   Newspaper reports said the house where Gomez was held also
served as a hideout for a Spanish-Colombian drug trafficking gang,
and that the kidnappers were led by a Spaniard called Antolin
Fernandez Pajuelo already wanted by police on drugs-related
charges.
	   Spanish police issued an arrest warrant for Pajuelo six years
ago in connection with the smuggling of 250 kilograms (550 pounds)
of cocaine that was discovered by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency
in the Caribbean, daily newspaper Publico reported.
	   Pajuelo, according to Publico, was linked to South American drug
cartels and ran drugs from Colombia to Central Europe.

Lithuanian parliament speaker calls for restricting ex-communists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ Parliament speaker Vytautas
Landsbergis has introduced a bill to ban former Communists from
serving in high-level government positions.
	   Landsbergis, a top leader of the drive for independence from the
Soviet Union, succeeded this year in passing a bill banning ex-KGB
members from many public and private-sector jobs, but the measure
was vetoed by President Valdas Adamkus, who says Lithuanians must
start abandoning resentments brewed in their troubled past.
	   The law, submitted on Tuesday, would prevent ex-Communists from
serving in parliament, national government and a wide range of
other official posts.
	   The ban would not apply to current members of parliament or
government, and it would only remain in effect for five years.
	   Landbergis was quoted by the Baltic News Service as saying the
law was needed to set the historical record straight about abuses
during the Communist era.
	   But a top opposition politician, Ceslovas Jursenas,
characterized the bill as unconstitutional and ``an act of
revenge,'' BNS said.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Rioters smashed store windows and burned
cars during a rally Wednesday by teachers and students against
education reforms.
	   Christmas shoppers ran for cover as hooligans tailing the rally
hurled rocks and gasoline bombs at stores and riot police. There
were no reports of serious injuries. At least 11 people were
detained by police.
	   The anarchist youths, who routinely disrupt otherwise peaceful
demonstrations, targeted banks, fast food restaurants and private
cars during running battles with police. One masked arsonist threw
a gasoline bomb into a McDonald's restaurant facing parliament.
	   The march by students and striking teachers stepped up a
widespread protest against the government-imposed reforms.
	   Joined by university students, an estimated 10,000 demonstrators
rallied in Athens, chanting slogans against Education Minister
Gerasimos Arsenis.
	   Teachers oppose changes in hiring policies that scraps a waiting
list system in favor of ranking according to exam results. The
students face a new university entrance system that gives more
weight to a series of tests rather than a single exam.
	   Rallies were also held in dozens towns around Greece.
	   The mounting opposition has created another serious headache for
the government of Premier Costas Simitis, which is struggling to
push through austerity measures demanded by the European Union.
	   Students also have blocked busy roads and occupied hundreds of
high school buildings in a growing two-week campaign.
	   Arsenis has charged that protesting children were being
``deliberately misinformed'' about the reforms by teachers and
private night schools which most Greek children attend to keep up
with classes.
	   ``People must understand that if we want to be equal partners in
Europe, children must get a proper education at schools,'' Arsenis
said after meeting with Simitis.
	   The waves of strikes and protests apparently reflect eroding
support for the Simitis government, according to a nationwide poll
published Wednesday.
	   The Socialists fell 6.5 percentage points behind the main
opposition New Democracy conservative party. There was no margin of
error.
	   Respondents said they believed the state of education is one of
Greece's most serious problems.

Koreans continue to dominate their native sport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ South Koreans captured three of the
night's gold medals in their native martial art of taekwondo
Wednesday, and said they were confident of holding off a Middle
East challenge when the sport debuts in the Olympics in 2000.
	   Competitors from the Middle East reached three of the night's
Asian Games finals, and Iran's Mehdi Bibak defeated Thailand's
Jathupol Yodanyamaneewong for gold in the men's bantamweight
division.
	   Bibak dropped Jathupol for an eight-count in the first round
with a swift kick to the head, silencing the home crowd.
	   ``This victory is for the people of Iran,'' said Bibak.
	   In the welterweight division, South Korean Ryu Keun-moo fell
behind Iran's Mahjid Aflakikhamseh in the first round, but
rebounded strongly for the gold with a 3-2 victory. Aflakikhamseh
limped off in agony 35 seconds into the final round.
	   ``The Middle Easterners are getting stronger but I don't think
they will be a threat to us at the Sydney Olympic Games,'' said
Ryu.
	   After three days, South Koreans had won nine of the 12 golds
decided.
	   Korean female welterweight Cho Hyang-mi defeated China's Chen
Zhong in a close match in the semifinal, where the Chinese
protested the decision, and then beat Alaa Kutkut of Jordan for the
gold.
	   Despite her disadvantage in reach and height, Cho dictated the
pace of the match, dominated all three rounds and won by a score of
2 to the Jordanian's minus 1.
	   ``I'm happy with my performance today. I hope to make the
national team,'' said Cho, who won gold at this year's World Cup,
as well as the 1995 and 1997 World Championships.
	   In the women's bantamweight final, South Korean rising star Lee
Ji-eun defeated Thailand's Nucharin Sukkhongdumnoen, who was third
at last year's World Championships.
	   With numerous protests throughout the day, Wednesday's session
fell behind schedule by nearly two hours.
	   Welterweight Chen, along with the Chinese coaches, refused to
leave the mat for nearly an hour to protest the decision that
favored Korea's Cho in their semifinal match.
	   To calm the restless crowd, the event announcer joked: ``We
should be proud of the fact that our taekwondo tournament has
created a new category for the sport with the highest number of
protests. Let us keep up this tradition!''
	   Spectators had joined in the protests Tuesday, some storming the
stage or throwing bottles in anger over a jury decision against
Thailand's Usa Silpajan in her bout with an Indonesian opponent.
	   Additional police were sent Wednesday.

Ukrainian president to visit Belarus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma will
travel to neighboring Belarus this weekend for an official visit to
focus on economic ties, his spokesman said Wednesday.
	   Kuchma is to meet with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko
and Prime Minister Sergei Ling for talks on ways to improve
economic links and business contacts and boost trade turnover
between the two former Soviet republics, said the spokesman,
Oleksandr Martynenko.
	   Their trade turnover fell 16 percent this year following the
economic crisis in Russia, which has severely affected the
economies of Ukraine and Belarus. Russia remains the principal
trade partner of both nations.
	   The crisis and its consequences will feature prominently in the
talks, Martynenko said.
	   In Belarus, officials said the sides are expected to sign a
long-term economic cooperation agreement and approve a 10-year
cooperation plan, the UNIAN news agency reported.
	   During the visit Friday and Saturday, Kuchma also plans to
discuss exchanging Ukrainian flour for Belarusian-made tractors,
and to travel to the city of Brest for a meeting of officials and
businessmen in the border regions of the two countries.

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Despite U.S. appeals to stop
violence, Palestinians stoned Israeli troops and motorists
Wednesday in the most widespread West Bank clashes in months, and a
Palestinian teen-ager was killed by Israeli army gunfire.
	   Helmeted soldiers in riot gear also fired rubber-coated steel
pellets and tear gas. In all, at least 67 Palestinians were hurt by
rubber bullets and three by live rounds. Three Israeli civilians
and two Israeli troops were lightly hurt by stones.
	   The death of Jihad Iyad, 17, who had been shot in the chest with
a live bullet, came just four days before the start of U.S.
President Bill Clinton's visit to Israel and the Palestinian areas
and was likely to trigger new violence.
	   Clashes erupted on the outskirts of most West Bank towns, with
rioters pressing for the release of Palestinian prisoners held by
Israel and marking the 11th anniversary of their uprising against
Israeli occupation.
	   In the bloodiest confrontation north of the West Bank town of
Ramallah, a wall of dense black smoke rose as Palestinians burned
tires, blocking a main road. Rioters, some masked with checkered
scarves covering their faces, hurled stones from slingshots at
Israeli troops.
	   ``We cannot let our brothers remain in jail,'' said a
20-year-old stone thrower, who gave only his last name, Jariri. He
grimaced in pain when a paramedic at the scene bandaged his right
hand and wrist after he was struck by a rubber-coated steel pellet.
	   In biblical Bethlehem, soldiers crouched on the ground to take
aim at stone throwers hiding behind overturned large metal trash
containers. One Palestinian waving a Palestinian flag doubled over
in pain after being struck by a rubber bullet in the stomach.

Memorial to Holocaust victims desecrated in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A memorial wall to Jewish victims of the
Holocaust was desecrated in the eastern Ukrainian town of Kharkiv,
a newspaper said Wednesday.
	   Unknown people stole two metal plaques that decorated the
so-called Wall of Sorrow in Kharkiv's Drobytsky Yar, the site of
mass killings of Jews during the Nazis' World War II occupation of
then-Soviet Ukraine.
	   It was the second such incident this year, the daily Fakty said.
The plaques also disappeared in August when the industrial city was
preparing to celebrate the anniversary of its World War II
liberation by the Soviet forces. They were later replaced by new
ones.
	   The paper did not say when the latest incident occurred but said
that it could be either an anti-Semitic attack or simply a criminal
act. The plaques are made of non-ferrous metals which can be sold
for cash and often attract thieves, the paper noted.
	   A bronze statue to a Russian World War II hero disappeared last
year from central Kharkiv and still has not been found, Fakty
added.

EU fines Italian-Greek ferry cartel dlrs 10.7 million
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission Wednesday
imposed fines totaling 9.12 million European currency units (dlrs
10.7 million) on seven shipping companies accused of fixing prices
on ferry routes between Italy and Greece.
	   EU antitrust authorities ruled the companies _ six Greek and one
Italian _ operated a cartel from 1987 to 1994 on passenger routes
between Greece and the Italian ports of Bari, Brindisi and Ancona.
	   EU spokesman Stefan Rating said the companies would meet at
least once a year to fix prices. The collusion was uncovered after
a tip-off from a Dutch tourist led to an EU investigation, Rating
told reporters.
	   One of the Greek companies, Strintizis Lines, said it would
appeal against its 1.5 million ecu (dlrs 1.76 million) fine. The
biggest fine of 3.26 million ecu (dlrs 3.81 million) was imposed on
Minoan Lines.

Memorial to Holocaust victims desecrated in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A memorial wall to Jewish victims of the
Holocaust was desecrated in the eastern Ukrainian town of Kharkiv,
a newspaper said Wednesday.
	   Unknown people stole two metal plaques that decorated the
so-called Wall of Sorrow in Kharkiv's Drobytsky Yar, the site of
mass killings of Jews during the Nazis' World War II occupation of
then-Soviet Ukraine.
	   It was the second such incident this year, the daily Fakty said.
The plaques also disappeared in August when the industrial city was
preparing to celebrate the anniversary of its World War II
liberation by the Soviet forces. They were later replaced by new
ones.
	   The paper did not say when the latest incident occurred but said
that it could be either an anti-Semitic attack or simply a criminal
act. The plaques are made of non-ferrous metals which can be sold
for cash and often attract thieves, the paper noted.
	   A bronze statue to a Russian World War II hero disappeared last
year from central Kharkiv and still has not been found, Fakty
added.

Japanese official calls U.S. currency policy inconsistent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's finance minister on Wednesday criticized
U.S. foreign exchange policy as inconsistent and self-serving, a
news report said.
	   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, speaking before a
parliamentary committee, said the United States ``desires a strong
dollar when U.S. industry is robust and wishes for the reverse when
it is weak,'' Kyodo News reported.
	   Miyazawa said he sees nothing ``consistent'' in U.S. currency
policy, Kyodo said.
	   The report quoted him as saying Washington has been ``relatively
generous'' about the weakening yen because U.S. industry, and
particularly financial companies, are so competitive now.
	   The declining value of the yen, which boosts the competitiveness
of Japanese exports in U.S. markets, could help push the U.S. trade
deficit as high as dlrs 300 billion next year, the report quoted
him as saying.
	   He also suggested that the dollar would not wander far from its
current rate of about 118 yen.
	   ``I imagine (the United States) feels comfortable (seeing the
dollar) at around 110 yen or 120 yen,'' Kyodo quoted him as saying.

Legal authority annuls election of conservative `black sheep'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ One of France's highest legal bodies on Wednesday
annulled the regional election of Former Defense Minister Charles
Millon, a political black sheep since he accepted far-right votes
last spring.
	   The Council of State ruled Millon had violated laws governing
regional elections when he engaged in a debate with an opponent
before the March vote.
	   Millon, a centrist, threw the mainstream right into chaos by
accepting votes from the extreme-right National Front party to win
the presidency of the regional council of the Rhone-Alpes region of
southeast France.
	   He has since formed his own party, known as The Right, calling
for a union of all non-leftist parties. He has said he wants his
new movement to scoop up extreme-right followers.

U.N. team withdraws when refused entry to Baath party office

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A U.N. weapons inspection team turned back
from a surprise visit to an office of Iraq's ruling party on
Wednesday when an official demanded it produce search papers, the
official Iraqi News Agency said.
	   It was the first time a U.N. team was blocked from conducting a
search for banned weapons since Richard Butler, head of the U.N.
Special Commission that oversees the inspectors, announced earlier
this week that ``surprise'' inspections would resume Tuesday.
	   ``Clearly we were blocked and we have the right to inspect any
time, any place, and the Iraqis blocked us,'' said Ewen Buchanan,
spokesman for the inspectors in New York, told The Associated
Press. ``Clearly, that's serious.''
	   Last month, a team was not allowed into a base run by Iranian
exiles, the Mujahedeen Khalq.
	   A U.N. team tried to get into a headquarters of the party of
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Wednesday morning ``in a
surprising and provocative manner,'' the agency said, quoting Gen.
Hossam Mohammed Amin, head of the National Monitoring Directorate
that provides escorts to the U.N. inspectors.
	   The Baath party official in charge of the headquarters demanded
that the head of the U.N. team give him a written declaration ``on
the material and items'' they sought, Amin said.
	   ``The team rejected this request and withdrew from the site,''
he was quoted as saying.
	   Amin said the behavior of the teams ``has the clear goal of
creating crises and problems.''
	   Buchanan, the U.N. spokesman, said he did not know whether the
inspectors would try to enter the site again but said the
inspections planned this week would continue.

Italy's communications minister: Keep Murdoch from biggest stake in
</HEADLINE>
pay TV &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's communications minister urged Italian
companies on Wednesday to join in a pay-TV partnership, saying they
must block Rupert Murdoch's media empire from getting the biggest
stake.
	   Murdoch's News Corp. and France's TF-1 have agreed to buy 49
percent of Telecom Italia's pay-TV unit. Italian partners have been
hard to find, given the estimated dlrs 5 billion investment that
would be required in coming years.
	   Communications Minister Salvatore Cardinale denied Wednesday he
had tried to block the venture outright. Cardinale told reporters
his aim was only to caution against giving Murdoch too much control
over programs for digital pay TV, chiefly soccer and entertainment.
	   ``The accord that Telecom Italia would have reached with Murdoch
would have left Murdoch as the only holder of the keys to the
warehouse. It would have given Murdoch a majority in content
provision,'' he said.
	   ``Our aim is to put together Italian companies in a digital
platform. In this context, foreign capital is welcome on condition
that there must be several content providers to offer users the
possibility to choose.''
	   The Italian press has pointed to Italian publisher RCS Editori,
film producer and distributor Cecchi Gori Group, and Italian media
group Mediaset SpA as the candidates likely to take up the residual
stake.

Chief inspector accuses Iraq of blocking legitimate inspection
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard
Butler accused Iraq Wednesday of blocking a completely legitimate
inspection after promising unhindered access and full cooperation.
	   ``This was an absolutely legal no-notice inspection and they
blocked us,'' Butler told The Associated Press. ``It was a blockage
and it's wrong.''
	   State-run Iraqi radio said a U.N. weapons team tried to get into
an office of President Saddam Hussein's ruling Baath party Tuesday
``in a provocative manner ... without previous announcement.''
	   The party official in charge demanded that the head of the U.N.
team give him a written declaration ``on the banned items'' the
team was seeking, according to the broadcast, which quoted the
official Iraqi News Agency. ``The team rejected this and
withdrew,'' it said.
	   Butler said Iraq's demand for ``notice from us in writing of
what we were looking for ... is simply wrong.''
	   ``Three weeks ago they solemnly promised the Security Council
that they would cooperate. And now this new requirement that we
tell them in advance in writing what we're looking for _ this is
nonsense,'' he said.
	   ``There's nothing in the Security Council resolutions that
requires that. This is the first time that I can remember them
asking for that,'' the chief inspector said.
	   The U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, and the
International Atomic Energy Agency must certify that Baghdad has
eliminated banned weapons before the Security Council can lift
sweeping economic sanctions imposed in 1990 after Iraq invaded
Kuwait.
	   Iraq curtailed UNSCOM's activities on Aug. 5 and completely shut
down inspections Oct. 31.
	   Under threat of U.S. airstrikes, Iraqi leaders reversed course
Nov. 14 and promised to give inspectors unfettered access to all
sites and documents related to its programs to develop nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles.
	   Butler announced Monday that weapons inspectors would begin a
series of surprise inspections in a final test of whether Baghdad
is cooperating fully in the search for banned weapons.
	   The Iraqis in the past have tried to block or thwart some
unannounced inspections, calling them provocative and an
infringement of sovereignty.
	   Butler would not say whether he planned to report Iraq's
blockage of Wednesday's inspection to the U.N. Security Council.
	   The surprise inspections, by visiting teams, are expected to be
finished late this week or early next week.
	   Butler said Monday that he would then prepare a report for U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on whether or not Iraq has kept its
Nov. 14 promise.
	   Annan will then report to the Security Council which must decide
that Iraq is in full cooperation with inspectors before it will
undertake a comprehensive review of Iraq's compliance with U.N.
resolutions.
	   Iraqi leaders see the review as the quickest route to easing or
lifting economic sanctions but diplomats say it will merely
establish a list of Baghdad's outstanding obligations _ and the
United States insists there is no link to ending sanctions.

Injured batsman returns home for back injury treatment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Forced to pull out of the Ashes series because of
a back injury, England batsman Graham Thorpe may struggle to be fit
for the World Cup in May.
	   The Surrey lefthander returned home on Wednesday for long-term
treatment of back pains which have bothered him since July, when he
had a cyst removed.
	   ``My back just isn't fit for cricket at the highest level,'' he
said on arrival at Heathrow airport after a 12,000-mile flight
which did little to ease the pain.
	   ``The only sensible thing was to come home and sort it out.
	   ``It's unfortunate and it's bad luck for me but life goes on,''
Thorpe said. ``I'm not setting any targets for when I want to be
back although it would be nice to be ready for the one-day
tournament in Sharjah in April.
	   ``But if that doesn't happen then I will just try to make sure I
am ready for the summer.''
	   If Thorpe doesn't make it for the one-day series, it's unlikely
he'll be able to endure the stresses of the month-long World Cup
the following month and England will hope he's fit in time for the
Test series against New Zealand.
	   Thorpe played in the first, drawn Test at Brisbane but was ruled
out of the second at Perth, which England lost heavily.
	   ``Trouble flared up again on the flight from Brisbane,'' Thorpe
said. ``I don't know if it was the flight itself or the fact I had
been batting for a long time that caused it to go.''
	   Thorpe's place in the team has gone to Graeme Hick, who was
originally called into the squad because of a back injury affecting
Mike Atherton. Opener Atherton has since recovered.
	   ``Although we are 1-0 down the mood in the camp is good,''
Thorpe said. ``When you lose you just want to turn it around as
quickly as you can and the boys are still right in it.''
	   The third Test in Adelaide starts on Friday.

Iran to test surface-to-surface missiles in war games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran will test fire surface-to-surface
missiles during the last stage of its naval war games, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency said Wednesday.
	   Neighboring Gulf states have been informed of the tests, the
agency said, quoting Issa Golverdi, the maneuvers' spokesman.
	   IRNA did not say what missiles would be fired.
	   Last September, Iran unveiled the Shahab-3 missile during a
military parade. The newly developed weapon, believed based on
North Korean technology, has a range of 1,300 kilometers (800
miles).
	   The agency did not say when the missile testing would take
place. The maneuvers began Friday.
	   To prove Iran's goodwill towards it neighbors, Golverdi said it
was informing nearby Gulf Arab countries of how the maneuvers were
being held and inviting Oman to send military observers.
	   He said the best achievement of the games was that Iranian and
Omani military personnel became acquainted with each other, IRNA
said.
	   The exercises kicked off with a six-gun salute ``as a sign of
respect, peace and friendship'' between Iran and the six Gulf Arab
countries, Golverdi said.
	   Iran has tried for a decade to conduct joint military exercises
with Gulf states, which are allies of the United States. But so
far, no Gulf country has agreed because of Tehran's insistence that
U.S. warships leave the region.
	   Iran's naval forces and its elite Revolutionary Guards are
participating in the exercises, which began with defensive
amphibious operations and the shelling of targets by warships and
air force fighter-bombers.
	   The 50,000 forces taking part in the maneuvers, code-named Unity
77, also practiced mine-laying, mine-sweeping, chemical attack
scenarios and air defense tactics.
	   Some 160 naval vessels, including submarines, and 120 aircraft
are taking part in the maneuvers, which extend from the central
Gulf to the Strait of Hormuz and into the Gulf of Oman.
	   An Iranian military official told The Associated Press that
during the games, an electronic warfare system capable of jamming
enemy radar also would be tested.

Doing business in Italy easier _ but still tough, Americans say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Doing business in Italy has become easier but
bureaucracy, an overregulated economy and high labor costs still
make the country a tough place to work, American executives said in
a survey published Wednesday.
	   The English-language Italy Daily newspaper and the American
Chamber of Commerce in Italy interviewed 60 American executives
from the largest U.S. companies with offices in Italy for the
survey.
	   Sixty-nine percent said doing business in Italy was more
difficult than in other European countries. Twenty-five percent
said it was the same and 1.9 percent said it was easier.
	   Italy's bureaucracy was blamed for the difficulties by 75
percent of those interviewed, followed by an overregulated economy
and high labor costs. Corruption and political instability were
also cited.
	   However, 41.1 percent said the business environment had improved
in the past five years; 41.8 percent said it had stayed the same
and 7.8 percent said it had gotten worse.
	   About 55 percent said they felt corruption had decreased over
the same period.

Amsterdam court outlaws claims that famed diary was forged
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ An Amsterdam court Wednesday
outlawed revisionist claims that Anne Frank's famed diary was a
forgery written by her father after World War II.
	   The decision was hailed as a landmark legal victory by the Anne
Frank Foundation, which is headquartered in the Amsterdam canal
house-turned-museum where the young Jewish diarist and her family
hid from the Nazis.
	   ``It is a very important step,'' said the foundation's executive
director, Hans Westra.
	   Amsterdam District Court ruled that anyone found guilty of
denying the diary's authenticity can be fined 25,000 guilders (dlrs
13,000).
	   The ruling was based on the foundation's complaint against a
book by Frenchman Robert Faurisson titled ``Anne Frank, A Critical
Approach,'' which describes the diary as a fake created by Anne's
father, Otto Frank.
	   The book was published by a group run by Belgian extreme
right-wing figure Siegfried Verbeke.
	   ``Today we have a very principled ruling from the Dutch court
that the diary is authentic and that it is forbidden to abuse Mr.
Frank,'' Westra said.
	   At a hearing in August, Verbeke said he would no longer
distribute or publish the book, but added that it was already
available on the Internet.
	   Neither Verbeke nor Faurisson, a former literature professor
well known in France for his Holocaust denials, was present in
court Wednesday for the ruling.
	   Westra condeded that cyberspace is a fertile ground for
revisionist ideas, and said the Anne Frank Foundation was
investigating if measures are possible to eradicate such
publications from the Internet.
	   Anne's diary documents the difficulties she and her family
endured while hiding from the Nazis in a secret annex hidden by a
movable bookcase from July 1942 until they were betrayed in the
fall of 1944.
	   Anne died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen camp just weeks before
it was liberated in the spring of 1945, and her diary was published
posthumously. It has become an international bestseller translated
into more than 50 languages.

Parliament supports premier in intelligence affair
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) _ Opposition leader Janez Jansa failed
to get parliamentary support Wednesday to oust Premier Janez
Drnovsek, after trying to hold him accountable for a secret deal
sealed between Slovenian and Israeli intelligence services.
	   Only 24 deputies in the 90-seat parliament voted for Drnovsek's
replacement. An absolute majority was needed to approve the motion.
Jansa's 14 Social Democrats were joined by 10 deputies from the
opposition Christian Democrats.
	   Drnovsek's Social Liberals and their government coalition
partner, the People's Party, supported Drnovsek with 46 votes.
Other deputies abstained.
	   It was Jansa's second attempt to replace Drnovsek over the
affair. In May, the parliament also voted against the motion by the
former defense minister.
	   In 1995, the head of Slovenia's intelligence service signed a
secret deal with his Israeli counterpart on general cooperation.
	   According to the constitution, each legal act is to be public,
and Jansa holds Drnovsek responsible for that breach.
	   Drnovsek refused to take responsibility Wednesday. In his
defense before parliament, the prime minister said, ``I've seen no
evidence to prove my direct responsibility. One who accuses should
present proof.''
	   The move was largely seen as part of Jansa's continued attempts
to harm the standing of Drnovsek's ruling party.

Swiss lawmakers elect country's first female president

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, INSERTS more background on Holocaust controversy,
women's rights. &QL; 
 &UR; By MATTHIAS BRUELLMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss politicians on Wednesday elected
Interior Minister Ruth Dreifuss as the country's president for
1999, making her the first woman and first Jew ever to lead the
Swiss government.
	   Women welcomed the election, which came less than 30 years after
female citizens won the right to vote.
	   ``After decades of the struggle for equality, the doors are
finally opening to women,'' Dreifuss told about 150 women who
gathered in front of the parliament building. ``Today we confirm
that we want this equality and that we are going to get it step by
step.''
	   Dreifuss' ethnic background has never been an issue, even though
the government has reported an increase in anti-Semitism in
Switzerland as a result of pressure from international Jewish
organizations to compensate the heirs of Holocaust victims who left
assets in Swiss banks.
	   Dreifuss, a non-practising Jew, has kept a low profile during
the controversy, defused last August when the two largest banks
agreed to a dlrs 1.25 billion settlement of World War II claims.
	   She has been in line for the one-year presidency since last
December, when she was elected vice president.
	   Dreifuss, 58, of the left-of-center Social Democrats, replaces
Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti in the largely ceremonial post, which
rotates on an annual basis among the seven members of the coalition
cabinet.
	   An assembly of the two houses of parliament approved Dreifuss'
appointment in a secret ballot by 158 votes out of a possible 210.
	   Defense Minister Adolf Ogi, who was president five years ago,
will be her deputy, putting him in line to assume the presidency
again in 2000.
	   Dreifuss is only the second woman to be elected to the Federal
Council, or cabinet, and is its only female member.
	   Christiane Brunner, a more controversial Social-Democrat who was
rejected in 1993 before Dreifuss stepped forward and entered the
cabinet as a compromise candidate, congratulated her political
``twin sister'' Wednesday and said she had no regrets that she lost
out.
	   Dreifuss, an economist and expert on social security, is in
control of health and social issues. She has overseen Switzerland's
drug policy, introducing measures to give heroin to long-term
addicts.
	   ``The struggle continues,'' said Dreifuss, adding that she hopes
fervently that she will be not remain the only woman in the
cabinet.

EU Commission formally proposes Russian food aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission Wednesday
formally proposed an emergency food aid package to Russia worth an
estimated 400 million European currency units (dlrs 460 million).
	   The proposal by the Commission, the European Union's executive
branch, must now be approved by the 15 EU member nations and the
European Parliament. The proposal was widely expected since the
Commission reached an agreement with Russia last week on the
details of the package.
	   EU leaders are expected to discuss the aid at their two-day
summit starting Friday in Vienna, Austria, as part of a wider
debate on relations with Russia.
	   EU foreign ministers agreed on principle Monday to back the
package, but insisted on tight controls to ensure the aid reaches
the needy, not profiteers.
	   The ministers said they wanted independent monitoring of the
distribution of the aid package which includes hundreds of millions
of tons of grain, beef, milk powder and other foodstuffs. They also
demanded monthly reports from the Russian authorities.
	   In making its proposal, the EU Commission warned the risk of
abuse could not be ruled out despite the controls.
	   ``It must be clear to all those involved in taking this decision
that the exercise is subject to serious potential risks, in
particular fraud,'' the Commission said in a statement.
	   Still, the Commission reiterated the case for the aid. It said
nearly half of Russia's 89 regions will have grain shortages this
winter. That is higher than a Commission estimate in mid-November
that a quarter of Russia's regions would have shortages.
	   The food aid will be sold in Russia at market prices, and
profits used to fund social projects.
	   The EU has been debating the aid package since Nov. 9, four days
after the United States announced it would provide Russia with a
dlrs 600 million food aid package.
	   Russia's worst grain harvest in 40 years, coming on the heels of
the summer's financial collapse have sent prices rising 50 percent
and prompted fears the poor won't be able to afford food through
the winter.

 &UR; Yeltsin retreats to country residence after leaving hospital &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin retreated to a wooded,
country home Wednesday after being released from a hospital, and it
appeared he would remain in hibernation despite the country's
pressing problems.
	   Yeltsin has not been a full-time president for months, and he
almost completely disappeared from public view during his more than
two weeks in the Central Clinical Hospital, where he was treated
for pneumonia.
	   Yeltsin, 67, insists that he has no serious health problems, but
after so many illnesses in recent years, few believe he can
maintain a normal working schedule.
	   ``Doctors are generally satisfied with the president's
condition,'' Yeltsin's spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said after the
president was discharged.
	   But, he added, Yeltsin will continue to receive ``periodic
checkups at the hospital'' and needs a ``convalescence period'' at
his country home, Rus, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of
Moscow.
	   Yeltsin did not have any meetings Wednesday and there was no
word on when he might return to the Kremlin.
	   The president's latest illness clearly demonstrated that he is
not involved in the day-to-day running of the government, though he
remains extremely sensitive to any suggestions that he's a lame
duck, or that he won't serve out his term until the year 2000.
	   The president's only major announcement during his illness came
Monday, when he visited the Kremlin for three hours to dismiss
several top aides, some of whom had dared to comment on the
president's health problems. Yeltsin returned to his sickbed
immediately afterward.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who is dealing with the
country's economic turmoil, said Yeltsin can ``perfectly perform''
his duties and will ``work until the end of his term.'' His remarks
were published Wednesday in the Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper.
	   Primakov has handled many presidential duties in recent months,
and he gathered his top ministers Wednesday to work out next year's
austere budget.
	   Yeltsin, meanwhile, has said almost nothing about Russia's
latest economic crisis, which hit four months ago, partly in
response to Asia's economic travails.
	   Russia in the 1990s has suffered one of the worst depressions
ever experienced by an industrial nation, and Yeltsin has given up
the pretense of suggesting solutions to the country's entrenched
problems.
	   Primakov said in Wednesday's interview that the government was
``not abandoning (economic) reforms, but the influence of the state
must be increased.''
	   He acknowledged that the currency was likely to continue
falling, and inflation, which will hit about 70 percent this year,
would probably keep rising.
	   ``We are doing our best to halt this slide (of the ruble) and
scale back inflation,'' he said.

U.N. team withdraws when refused entry to Baath party office
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES throughout with Butler's quotes, work to end by
Monday, Iraqi foreign minister seeking Arab support. No pickup.
 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In a new challenge to the U.N.'s search for
illegal weapons in Iraq, a team of inspectors was turned back
Wednesday when it tried to enter a major office of the ruling Baath
Party, a key site of Saddam Hussein's government.
	   Chief weapons inspector Richard Butler called the Iraqi action
``a blockage.''
	   ``This was an absolutely legal no-notice inspection and they
blocked us,'' he told The Associated Press in New York.
	   The inspectors withdrew after an Iraqi official demanded that
they first provide a written declaration ``on the material and
items'' they sought, the official Iraqi News Agency said.
	   The incident _ which has the potential to blow into another
crisis _ came two days after Butler announced Monday that he was
ordering the resumption of the so-called surprise inspections. On
Tuesday, the inspectors visited 32 sites.
	   Butler said the Iraqi demand for a written notice is ``simply
wrong'' and ``nonsense.''
	   Iraq, which had suspended the inspections in August, allowed
them to resume only last month, averting a military strike by the
United States and Britain. The two countries have left an armada in
the Gulf to ensure Iraq abides by its promise to cooperate fully
with the inspectors.
	   The United Nations Special Commission, which runs the
inspections program, must certify Iraq has eliminated its chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons as well as long-range missiles
before U.N. economic sanctions can be lifted.
	   The sanctions were imposed after the 1990 Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait, and Iraqi officials have long insisted they have eliminated
all illegal weapons.
	   Wednesday's disagreement was played out outside one of the four
branch headquarters of the Baath Party in Baghdad.
	   A U.N. inspection team tried to get into the building at about 9
a.m. (0600 gmt) ``in a surprising and provocative manner,'' INA
said, quoting Gen. Hossam Mohammed Amin, who heads an office that
liaises with the inspectors.
	   He complained that the team was seeking a confrontation.
	   ``The practices of the inspectors .... have the clear goal of
creating crises and problems,'' Amin said.
	   The exact location of the headquarters was not immediately
known. But witnesses say a large team of U.N. inspectors gathered
in front of a Baath Party headquarters in the Baghdad neighborhood
of Adhamiya on Wednesday morning.
	   Ewen Buchanan, the inspectors' spokesman in New York, said this
round of inspections, which were scheduled to end Monday, would
continue. He did not know whether inspectors would try to enter the

	   As many as 140 inspectors on regular teams are working in Iraq
as well as some visiting experts, Caroline Cross, a U.N.
spokeswoman in Baghdad, said earlier. She would not give the exact
number involved but said it was ``a little less than 200,'' or the
entire contingent.
	   When asked if they would carry out surprise visits, she said
only the ``inspectors will carry on a full range of activities.''
	   Unannounced visits in the past have been a major source of
friction with Iraq, leading to three crises in the past year.
	   Iraqi newspapers carried further accounts Wednesday of comments
by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz in Moscow in which he said
there is a limit to Iraq's cooperation with the United Nations in
the search for weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``This situation is no longer acceptable,'' Aziz said, referring
to the U.N. sanctions that have blocked free export of Iraq's oil.
	   Meanwhile, in a letter released Wednesday, Iraqi Foreign
Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf appealed for help from Arab
countries, which he said had largely deserted Iraq.
	   ``Iraqis in their neighborhoods, cities and villages wonder
where are their brother Arabs and where is the Arab League and its
secretary general with what is happening to their brothers in
Iraq,'' al-Sahhaf in a letter to the Cairo-based league.
	   In November, several key Arab countries declared that Iraq would
be held responsible for any conflict.

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Nobel Peace laureates John Hume and David
Trimble, leaders of the efforts to end Northern Ireland's three
decades of sectarian violence, on Wednesday made a shared vow to
overcome remaining obstacles to peace.
	   ``I see this honor as a very powerful statement of support for
the peace process on our streets and that it will, in my opinion,
strengthen the peace process enormously,'' said Hume, 61, at a news
conference at the Norwegian Nobel Institute a day before the prize
is presented.
	   Hume leads the Social Democratic and Labor Party, Northern
Ireland's largest Roman Catholic party, and Hume heads the main
Protestant grouping, the Ulster Unionist Party.
	   They were named winners of the prize for their work in pushing
through an accord in April aimed at ending bloodshed between
Catholics, who wanted Northern Ireland to become a part of the
Irish Republic, and Protestants who want it to remain a part of the
United Kingdom.
	   The presentation comes in the shadow of a dispute over Trimble's
party demanding that the outlawed Irish Republican Army begin to
disarm before its political wing Sinn Fein is allowed to join a new
governing body for Northern Ireland.
	   Both Nobel laureates admitted that difficulties remain, but said
peace must succeed.
	   ``There is no crisis,'' said Trimble, who shook hands with Hume
as they began their news conference. ``I don't accept that the
process is running into trouble. I know that it is not.''
	   At roughly the same time in London, Sinn Fein's chief negotiator
Martin McGuinness said Trimble has ``dismally failed'' in following
up the April peace accord. McGuinness accused Trimble of provoking
a crisis with his insistence that the IRA surrender its huge
weapons stockpiles.
	   In its October awards citation, the Nobel committee called Hume
``the clearest and most consistent of Northern Ireland's political
leaders in his work for a peaceful solution.'' The citation praised
Trimble for showing ``political courage ... at a critical stage in
the process.''
	   The latest dispute in peace process came last week with the
Ulster Unionist Party's demand for IRA disarmament before Sinn Fein
could be recognized.
	   The April peace agreement called for Protestant and Catholic
politicians forming a multiparty administration for Northern
Ireland and joint policy-making bodies with the Irish Republic by
October. Neither of those steps have been taken.
	   Despite delays, Trimble said he expected the body to be in place
in March or April.
	   Hume called the peace accord a watershed and said it was the
duty of all parties to carry out the will of the people, since
voters in both parts of Ireland had endorsed the plan in
referendums.
	   ``A couple of years ago, who would have thought that the two
governments and all the parties would have been in the same room in
a totally peaceful atmosphere?. That in itself is a major progress
given our past.'' Hume said.
	   Hume said the people of Northern Ireland already felt safer,
while Trimble said one remaining problem was the creation of a
normal police force capable of dealing with the new danger of
organized crime.
	   The laureates were just two of many involved in the peace
process, including Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams.
	   At the news conference, Trimble was asked how he expects peace
to succeed when he refuses to even shake hands with Adams.
	   ``The original idea of a handshake is that someone offered us an
empty hand to show there were no weapons in it. I look forward to
the time Mr. Adams and his associates are able to show an empty
hand. That time will come,'' Trimble said
	   The Nobel Prizes, which include a 7.6 million Swedish kronor
(dlrs 950,000) award and a gold medal, are always presented on the
Dec. 10 anniversary of the death of their benefactor, Alfred Nobel,
a Swede who invented dynamite. The peace prize is awarded in Oslo
and the other prizes in Stockholm, Sweden.

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   A trough will continue to move further away from the area today,
taking most organized shower activity with it. At the same time,
dry air in the middle levels of the atmosphere will combine with a
strong high-pressure ridge over the east Caribbean to produce
another relatively dry day across Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin
Islands.
	   Mainly east winds today will transport enough moisture across
the area to allow widely scattered showers to develop, but these
will be generally limited to the morning hours.
	   As the high pressure builds across the region today, winds are
expected to strengthen. While they will not be as strong as they
were yesterday, many areas may see wind speeds of 20 to 25 knots.
	   This will maintain rough sea conditions offshore and across the
Anegada and Mona Passages. Small craft advisories will remain in
effect for all coastal waters except the near shore waters of
western Puerto Rico.

German doctors protest health care cuts

<TEXT>
	   POTSDAM, Germany (AP) _ Thousands of doctors in eastern Germany
shut their practices Wednesday to protest government plans for
health care cuts on Jan. 1 that include curbing doctors' fees.
	   In the cities of Potsdam and Schwerin, 2,000 doctors
demonstrated against the cuts, which the lower house of parliament
is expected to pass Thursday. The protests are to peak with a
nationwide doctors' strike Dec. 18, when the upper house considers
the bill.
	   In Brandenburg state, which surrounds Berlin, only emergency
medical services were open as 3,000 doctors shut their doors for
the day.
	   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's center-left government says the
cuts, expected to total up to 4 billion marks (dlrs 2.4 billion)
next year, are needed to avoid an increase in already high
contributions to the national health insurance system.
	   Employers and employees contribute equally to the federally
regulated system, and patients get low-cost service in return.
	   Doctors' lobbies charge the measures threaten 100,000 health
care jobs, will lower the standard of service for walk-in patients
and risk depriving patients of advances in medicine.

	   The decision means that the 83-year-old Pinochet, under armed

years of battles through British courts fighting extradition.

U.N. team withdraws when refused entry to Baath party office
</HEADLINE>

end by Monday, Iraqi foreign minister seeking Arab support. No

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In a new challenge to the U.N.'s search for
illegal weapons in Iraq, a team of inspectors was turned back
Wednesday when it tried to enter a major office of the ruling Baath
Party, a key site of Saddam Hussein's government.
	   Chief weapons inspector Richard Butler called the Iraqi action
``a blockage.''
	   ``This was an absolutely legal no-notice inspection and they
blocked us,'' he told The Associated Press in New York.
	   The inspectors withdrew after an Iraqi official demanded that
they first provide a written declaration ``on the material and
items'' they sought, the official Iraqi News Agency said.
	   The incident _ which has the potential to blow into another
crisis _ came two days after Butler announced Monday that he was
ordering the resumption of the so-called surprise inspections. On
Tuesday, the inspectors visited 32 sites.
	   Butler said the Iraqi demand for a written notice is ``simply
wrong'' and ``nonsense.''
	   Iraq, which had suspended the inspections in August, allowed
them to resume only last month, averting a military strike by the
United States and Britain. The two countries have left an armada in
the Gulf to ensure Iraq abides by its promise to cooperate fully
with the inspectors.
	   The United Nations Special Commission, which runs the
inspections program, must certify Iraq has eliminated its chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons as well as long-range missiles
before U.N. economic sanctions can be lifted.
	   The sanctions were imposed after the 1990 Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait, and Iraqi officials have long insisted they have eliminated
all illegal weapons.
	   Wednesday's disagreement was played out outside one of the four
branch headquarters of the Baath party in Baghdad.
	   A U.N. inspection team tried to get into the building Wednesday
morning ``in a surprising and provocative manner,'' INA said,
quoting Gen. Hossam Mohammed Amin, who heads an office that liaises
with the inspectors.
	   He complained that the team was seeking a confrontation.
	   ``The practices of the inspectors ... have the clear goal of
creating crises and problems,'' Amin said.
	   The exact location of the headquarters was not immediately
known. But witnesses say a large team of U.N. inspectors gathered
in front of a Baath Party headquarters in the Baghdad neighborhood
of Adhamiya on Wednesday morning.
	   Ewen Buchanan, the inspectors' spokesman in New York, said this
round of inspections, which were scheduled to end Monday, would
continue. He did not know whether inspectors would try to enter the
site again.
	   As many as 140 inspectors on regular teams are working in Iraq
as well as some visiting experts, Caroline Cross, a U.N.
spokeswoman in Baghdad, said earlier. She would not give the exact
number involved but said it was ``a little less than 200,'' or the
entire contingent.
	   When asked if they would carry out surprise visits, she said
only the ``inspectors will carry on a full range of activities.''
	   Unannounced visits in the past have been a major source of
friction with Iraq, leading to three crises in the past year.
	   Iraqi newspapers carried further accounts Wednesday of comments
by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz in Moscow in which he said
there is a limit to Iraq's cooperation with the United Nations in
the search for weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``This situation is no longer acceptable,'' Aziz said, referring
to the U.N. sanctions that have blocked free export of Iraq's oil.
	   Meanwhile, in a letter released Wednesday, Iraqi Foreign
Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf appealed for help from Arab
countries, which he said had largely deserted Iraq.
	   ``Iraqis in their neighborhoods, cities and villages wonder
where are their brother Arabs and where is the Arab League and its
secretary general with what is happening to their brothers in
Iraq,'' al-Sahhaf in a letter to the Cairo-based league.
	   In November, several key Arab countries declared that Iraq would
be held responsible for any conflict.

Poland's army puts high price on post-Warsaw Pact property
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MONIKA SCISLOWSKA  &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ From shoestrings to military bunkers,
Poland's army is shedding off obsolete property and equipment as
the former Warsaw Pact nation prepares to join NATO in April.
	   But an auction Wednesday of military property around the country
indicated that some of the prices are too high.
	   Only one of eight properties sold _ a complex including a
garage, warehouse, gas station and workshop buildings in the
central city of Pulawy that attracted slightly above the opening
price of 8 million zlotys (dlrs 2.3 million).
	   ``It was a disillusionment because there were many potential
bidders,'' said Andrzej Jamrozek, chairman of the Military Property
Agency set up last year to sell the unneeded items. ``We see now
that the military property market is not so unusual.''
	   The idea is simple. With Poland having to change its military
structure and equipment to become a member of the Western alliance,
it can raise money to help pay for the required changes by selling
off the surplus.
	   Most of the proceeds _ 70 percent _ go to the Defense Ministry
and the rest helps fund Jamrozek's agency.
	   Defense Minister Janusz Onyszkiewicz, appearing appropriately
prudent, said the money has yet to be designated for any specific
purpose. It could pay for any urgent or unexpected expenses as the
military prepares for NATO membership, he said.
	   Changes in communications and air defense systems are among the
requirements for joining NATO.
	   Previous sales of items such as shoe strings, construction
equipment, mobile electricity generators and kitchens have raised 2
million zlotys (dlrs 580,000) for the ministry, and Jamrozek hopes
to get it another 18 million zlotys (dlrs 5.2 million) this month.
	   He needs a better outcome than Wednesday, when the single sale
fell far short of his goal of raising at least 67 million zlotys
(dlrs 19.4 million).
	   Wlodzimierz Wapinski, a potential bidder who owns a chemical
company in southern Poland, complained the prices were ``too
high.'' He wanted to pay 200,000 zlotys (dlrs 58,000) for a laundry
house in Gliwice, but the opening price was 440,000 zlotys (dlrs
127,000).
	   Jamrozek blamed independent appraisers for the pricing and said
another auction of the unsold properties in January would start
with lower prices.
	   The agency expects more success Thursday, when it auctions off a
34-hectare (84-acre) plot in Gluchow Gorny, 350 kilometers (210
miles) southwest of Warsaw.
	   It includes an air-conditioned nuclear shelter 15 meters (50
feet) underground that formerly was a Warsaw Pact secret war
headquarters and now could be a nice wine cellar, the agency notes.
The opening bid price is 800,000 zlotys (dlrs 231,000).
	   Agency spokesman Wieslaw Rozbicki said some property sells well,
such as barracks and other buildings close to Poland's western
border with Germany. NATO membership means a reduction in Polish
bases along the border with its new ally.
	   Military airports don't sell, he said, because they often cannot
be subdivided or developed for other uses.
	   He also said some Soviet MIG jet fighters from the 1960s have
been sold as collectors' items, with an American buying three at
the scrap price of 20,000 zlotys (dlrs 5,700) each.

	   Straw's decision delighted human rights groups, victims of the
Pinochet years and most rank-and-file legislators in Britain's
governing Labor Party _ many of whom joined anti-Pinochet
demonstrations as young socialists in their student days.
	   But it dealt a new blow to Britain's already strained relations
with Chile, which has waged a diplomatic battle for the general's
release partly because of fears that renewed tensions between his
supporters and opponents will threaten the country's new democracy.
	   The decision also opened the prospect of a long legal fight by
an old man living _ and possibly dying _ under arrest in a foreign
country.

Maier and Cretier seeking wins amidst reports of drug crackdown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VAL D'ISERE, France (AP) _ The alpine World Cup returns to
Europe this weekend with Hermann Maier looking for a return to
form, Olympic champion Jean-Luc Cretier seeking a first World Cup
win, and growing fears that French police may continue their hunt
for banned drugs.
	   With recent crackdowns on the use of banned drugs in sport,
there are growing concerns that French police are prepared to
search athletes' rooms, as they did during the Tour de France.
	   Swiss media cite Austrian skiers _ at the center of doping
accusations at the season opener in Solden, Austria _ vowing that
no hint of drugs would be found on the team.
	   One promised to leave ``even Aspirin bottles at home.''
	   French Ski Federation officials denied any knowledge of such
plans by French authorities.
	   ``I haven't heard of any raid,'' said French Ski Federation
logistics director Jean-Michel Boisier, in charge of accommodations
for racers in Val d'Isere. ``It would surprise me greatly since
skiing is hardly the same environment as cycling.''
	   On the slopes, Maier will have to forget the drugs issue as he
attempts to return to the top of the podium.
	   After being shut out in North America, ``The Herminator'' hopes
the return to European snow will result in a victory.
	   He has already won the giant slalom at the season opener in
Solden.
	   Since then, Maier, who dominated the circuit last season when he
won 11 races on the way to becoming the overall World Cup champion,
has only a second place to show for his efforts.
	   At this point last season, his rookie year on the World Cup
circuit, Maier had already collected a pair of victories and three
other podium finishes in five races.
	   But even as Maier searches for last year's winning formula, the
Austrians continue to dominate the circuit, taking four out of five
races, and collecting 10 podium finishes.
	   They currently sit atop the standings in every discipline.
	   Currently four of the top five places in the overall standings
are occupied by Austrian skiers.
	   Christian Mayer and Stefan Eberharter, Maier and Thomas
Stangassinger are in the top five, with only Norway's Kjetil Andre
Aamodt, in third, breaking the sweep.
	   Shaking up the pecking order within the Austrian team,
Eberharter has collected a pair of wins - in the giant slalom and
super-G in North America.
	   Compatriot Mayer's consistent performances have vaulted him to
the top of the overall standings despite remaining winless.
	   With the speed races in Whistler Mt., Canada cancelled due to
foggy conditions, the men will run their first downhill of the
season.
	   The weekend also marks Cretier's first downhill since becoming
Olympic champion in Nagano last February.
	   Cretier, who has never won a World Cup race, will be looking to
confirm his Olympic gold with a victory in front of home fans.
	   The men will also race a pair of super-G's, with an extra one
moved from Canada.
	   The Austrian men share the spotlight this season, as do their
women, who have displayed the same dominance through the early
races.
	   The First Criterium kicks off with the women's events, a super-G
on Thursday and a giant slalom on Friday.
	   With double Olympic champion Katja Seizinger announcing last
weekend that knee injuries would keep her out of competition for
the entire season, the way has been cleared for Austria's women to
continue their assault.
	   Austrian skiers top the rankings in every discipline, with
Alexandra Meissnitzer leading the overall, Super-G and giant slalom
standings, Renate Geotschl topping the downhill with a pair of
wins, and Sabine Egger the slalom.
	   Only Seizinger's teammate Martina Ertl breaks up an Austrian
domination of the overall standings, ahead of Goetschl who sits
third.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Researchers said Wednesday
they have discovered the oldest complete skeleton of a human
ancestor, a 4-foot-tall ape-man dating back 3.6 million years.
	   The find could shed light on a pivotal debate about human
origins: was early man just a plains dweller or also a
tree-climber.
	   Ron Clarke, a British paleo-anthropologist at the University of
Witwatersrand who made the find, and his colleague Phillip Tobias
announced they uncovered the skull and leg bones belonging to foot
and ankle fragments Clarke found in 1994.
	   The skull and legs are still imbedded in iron-hard rock in a
cave near Johannesburg. The rock is expected to yield the pelvis,
vertebrae and other limb bones as workers chip away the material
around them, said Clarke.
	   ``It's one of many missing links from ape to man,'' said Clarke
at a news conference. With the skeleton, ``We're getting closer to
the ape end'' of man's evolution, he said.
	   Clarke and Tobias contend that a large articulated big toe on
the 1994 find implied that humans, as they evolved from apes, both
walked upright like men and climbed trees like some primates.
	   But other paleontologists argue that to qualify as pre-human
ancestors, ape-men must have walked only on two feet, a development
they say took place on the open plains.
	   ``Everyone is pretty sure we came from tree-living animals,''
said Richard Sherwood, assistant professor of anthropology at the
University of Wisconsin in a telephone interview. ``It's a matter
of when the transition occurred somewhere.''
	   Once the bones are pried from the rock _ a process expected to
take another year _ they can be examined to see if the hip and leg
structures bear out the tree-climbing theory.
	   In a telephone interview from London, a top expert on human
origins said the finding of a complete skeleton is rare in the
study of early man, and potentially very important once it's out of
the ground.
	   But the expert, Chris Stringer, head of the human origins
research group at the Natural History Museum in London, added:
``Some people questioned whether (Clarke and Tobias) were going too
far in drawing a conclusion that it was a divergent big toe.''
	   The discovery, documented Wednesday in the South African Journal
of Science, was to be reported as a news item in the magazine
Nature in London on Thursday.
	   The skeleton was discovered underground at Sterkfontein, a
former lime quarry cave that has yielded a number of hominid skulls
since the 1930s.
	   Clarke and Tobias said it appeared the Australopithecus
africanus, as it is known scientifically, fell down a 15-meter
(45-foot) shaft. Believed to have been 4 feet tall (1.20 meters),
the creature lived in a wooded area and was capable of climbing
trees, Clarke said.
	   Scientists determined the creature's date of origin by examining
the rock. Fragments of older hominid fossils have been found in
Kenya, where Meave Leakey _ the daughter-in-law of famous East
African paleo-anthropologists Lawrence and Mary Leakey _ discovered
a 4.2 million year-old Australopithecus afarensis.
	   The skeleton _ unnamed until its sex can be determined _ could
provide vital information about links between early man in East and
southern Africa. Stringer said the skeleton could be an even more
primitive species than expected.
	   ``What was it's life style, how much time did it spend on the
ground?'' Stringer asked. ``It will be important to see what this
is. Will it show links to East Africa?''
	   After the 1994 find, Clarke and his team said they uncovered
more bones belonging to the foot and ankle while rummaging through
animal bones at a university cupboard in 1997. The find sent them
back to Sterkfontein to search for the rest of the skeleton.
	   The find of a complete australopithecus skeleton will help
researchers fill the gaps in other discoveries, Clarke said.
	   Previously, the most complete early hominid was ``Lucy,'' an
Australopithecus whose partial skeleton _ and only fragments of the
skull _ were discovered in 1974 in Ethiopia. The oldest complete
skeleton before this latest discovery dates back to 1.8 million
years, Clarke said. It was that of a Homo Erectus, found in Kenya.

European drug makers Zeneca and Astra to merge

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Sweden's Astra and Britain's Zeneca
confirmed Wednesday they will merge in a dlrs 37 billion deal that
will create one of the world's biggest drug manufacturers.
	   Astra is best known for Prilosec, an ulcer and heartburn
medication that's the world's top selling prescription drug.
Zeneca, based in London, is the second biggest maker in the world
of cancer drugs behind U.S.-based Bristol-Myers Squibb.
	   The companies expect annual cost savings of dlrs 1.1 billion
from the new company, which will be called AstraZeneca. However,
they expect to incur about dlrs 1.2 billion in restructuring costs
and about 6,000 jobs, or 11 percent of its global workforce, are
expected to be lost in the next three years as a result of the
merger.
	   The merger had been rumored for months and was expected given
the wave of deals in the pharmaceutical industry. Last week,
Germany's Hoechst and France's Rhone-Poulenc agreed to merge their
drug and agrichemical businesses as the first step toward a total
merger. In France, Sanofi and Synthelabo recently announced their
dlrs 10 billion merger.
	   Behind all these mergers in Europe and the United States is the
need to increase research spending to compete with giants such as
Pfizer, Glaxo Wellcome and Merck, and the desire to pool resources
to boost marketing.
	   ``If we are going to be competitive among world pharmaceutical
companies, we need this merger,'' said Hakan Mogren, chief
executive of Astra, who will be deputy chairman of the new company.
The company is based in Soedertaelje, 35 kilometers (20 miles)
south of Stockholm.
	   Sweden's Wallenberg family owns 12 percent of Astra, established
in 1913. The company is also the maker of lidocaine, one of the
leading local anesthesia drugs first developed in the 1940s.
	   While its best known for Prilosec, the drug is scheduled to lose
its patent protection in 2001. That will open the door for generic
firms to make a less expensive copy and slow the company's overall
sales growth.
	   Besides its cancer drugs, Zeneca also has a large agrichemical
business and owns Salick Health Care, a U.S. operator of cancer
treatment and dialysis centers. Last year, the company marketed its
the migraine drug Zomig, which it bought from Glaxo Wellcome in
1995 while the drug was still being tested in humans.
	   But like Astra, Zeneca also has several drugs that are expected
to soon lose their patent protection. Analysts speculated that was
a leading factor influencing the merger.
	   ``This is a winning combination,'' said Sergio Traversa, an
analyst with Mehta Partners, a drug industry investment firm.
``Both are strong in limited areas.''
	   The AstraZeneca corporate headquarters would be in London, the
research and development headquarters in Sweden.
	   The chairman of the new company will be Percy Barnevik, who
heads Investor AB, the investment of arm of the Wallenberg family.
Zeneca's top executive, Tom McKillop, will be CEO.
	   The deal, which is considered a merger of equals, has already be
approved by the board of directors of both companies.
	   Zeneca had dlrs 8.57 billion in sales in 1997 and has a current
market value of dlrs 38.62 billion. Astra posted dlrs 5.68 billion
in sales in 1997 and has a current market value of dlrs 24.48
billion.
	   Both companies had earnings of dlrs 1.2 billion in 1997.

Rowdy protests greet Canadian prime minister in Vancouver
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ Prime Minister Jean Chretien
returned to Vancouver for the first time since a protest-plagued
summit meeting last year _ and was targeted by even rowdier
protests that resulted in 10 arrests and at least five injuries.
	   Police in riot gear used batons after some of the more than 700
protesters tried to break through a security cordon surrounding the
hotel where Chretien was speaking at a fund-raising dinner Tuesday
night.
	   The protest was organized by activists still bitter at Chretien
because of events at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit
meeting in Vancouver in November 1997.
	   Students trying to protest against the presence of
then-Indonesian President Suharto at the summit were arrested and,
in some cases strip-searched, by Royal Canadian Mounted Police
officers.
	   Since then, some of the students have been pressing for
inquiries into whether Chretien's office ordered the suppression of
protests in order to spare Suharto embarrassment.
	   Chretien said he supported the protesters' right to express
themselves as long as they didn't infringe on others' rights.
	   ``They were noisy,'' Chretien said. ``They were noisy. Democracy
is noisy and messy sometimes.''

Sonic booms from Israeli jets frighten some Beirut residents
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with prime minister-designate's comment, more flights
by Israeli jets in 7th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes broke the sound barrier
over Beirut Wednesday, causing two loud booms that sent panicky
residents scurrying for cover.
	   The low flights over the capital came hours after other Israeli
jets and helicopters conducted mock bombing runs over southern
Lebanon, drawing anti-aircraft fire.
	   Two Israeli planes flew low over Beirut at 9:10 a.m. (0710 GMT)
at speeds of more than 1,200 kilometers per hour (750 miles per
hour), bringing rush-hour traffic to a momentary standstill in some
places.
	   The supersonic booms rattled windows of apartment buildings.
Some people said they were knocked off their chairs. Others jumped
from their beds thinking that bombs were falling.
	   A resident of the crowded Mar Elias neighborhood of Beirut said
one school began to send its pupils to basements.
	   Anti-aircraft guns fired at the Israeli jets from Naameh, a
coastal village 16 kilometers (10 miles) south of Beirut, security
officials said.
	   Israeli planes flew over the city again about two hours later,
but broke no sound barriers.
	   Prime Minister-designate Salim Hoss denounced the flights as
``aggressive and provocative.''
	   ``We uphold our attitude toward liberating our territory from
the Israeli occupation,'' Hoss said in a statement broadcast by
state-run Beirut Radio.
	   Israeli jets frequently make high-altitude flights and break the
sound barrier over Beirut. But Wednesday's flights were the lowest
in years and reminded people of the Israeli invasion of 1982 when
the city came under severe bombardment.
	   Earlier Wednesday, security officials said, Israeli warplanes
made repeated mock bombing runs over southern Lebanon where
Lebanese guerrillas are fighting Israeli troops and their allied
militiamen.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah is leading the war to oust the
Israelis from an occupied zone in southern Lebanon. Israel set up
the zone in 1985 as a buffer against guerrilla attacks on its
northern territory.

Eritrea: Sudan shelled border location in Eritrea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Eritrea has filed an official complaint
to the United Nations against Sudan after the Sudanese army shelled
two border villages in Eritrea over the weekend, a senior official
said Wednesday.
	   Presidential advisor Yemane Gebremeskel said the long-range
artillery shellings on Saturday of the Arbaate Asher and Alighider
near the western border town of Tesenai, about 200 kilometers (125
miles) west of the capital Asmara, were routine provocations by
neighboring Sudan.
	   No one was reportedly hurt and Gebremeskel said Eritrean forces
did not retaliate.
	   The targets were unclear. Alighider is a cotton plantation near
the Sudanese border.
	   The foreign ministers of Sudan and Eritrea met in Qatar on Nov.
10 after Sudan claimed its army had been shelled from inside
Eritrea and the two signed a memorandum of understanding that
called for regular talks.
	   It was unclear who fired the shells on Sudan last month. Eritrea
denies accusations by Sudan that it allows Sudanese rebel bases on
its territory.
	   Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir said in late November a
complete end to hostilities with Eritrea was imminent.
	   But Gebremeskel said a rapprochement was only posible if the
Khartoum government ceases activities like the latest shellings,
which destabilize the region.
	   Relations between Sudan and Eritrea soured in 1994, with each
government blaming the other country for backing rebels fighting
them.
	   An office for southern Sudan's Christian and animist rebels
fighting the Arab and Islamic Sudanese government of Omar el-Bashir
in the north of Sudan, operates out of Asmara.
	   In October Sudan admitted supporting Eritrean rebels.
	   The 15-year civil war in Sudan has killed more than 1.5 million
people.

UEFA executive committee to approve new-look club competitions to
</HEADLINE>
counter Super League &QL; 
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Who needs a Super League?
	   Following months of argument over the future of European club
soccer, UEFA's executive committee meets Thursday and Friday to put
in place a revamped Champions League and UEFA Cup.
	   Europe's top soccer clubs have endorsed plans for a new 32-team
Champions' League, designed by UEFA to fight off a breakaway Super
League.
	   But the starting date, setup and financial structure of the new
competitions remain to be approved at the meeting in Lausanne.
	   ``We have set the sails for a start next season,'' UEFA general
secretary Gerhard Aigner said last week. Top clubs want an early
start to boost earnings.
	   The Super League project was launched earlier this year by
Milan-based marketing company Media Partners, which said that new
pay-per-view TV rights would help boost annual revenues for
Europe's leading clubs.
	   The clubs were concerned that, of the dlrs 322 million generated
by last season's Champions League, only dlrs 157 million went to
the teams.
	   As the Super League plans gained momentum with secret meetings
of the top clubs, UEFA, which has run European soccer since 1954,
threatened to suspend clubs and players opting into the League.
	   It also set up a task force, involving senior executives of
European leagues and clubs as well as UEFA officials, to examine
the future of European soccer competitions.
	   UEFA came up with a new Champions League format which it expects
will generate some 800 million Swiss francs (dlrs 570 million),
around three-quarters of the proceeds being distributed to clubs.
	   Though falling far short of the Super League's promised jackpot,
UEFA insists its prize money is guaranteed.
	   It has said it would investigate the possibility of matches
being shown on pay-per-view television in order to finance the
revamped league. Broadcasting contracts and marketing would remain
under UEFA's control.
	   The competition will be expanded from 24 teams to 32, playing in
eight groups of four in the first stage.
	   The European governing body's efforts in October persuaded
representatives of AC Milan, Real Madrid and 10 other major teams
not to join the Super League.
	   The clubs agreed that 5 percent of the money they receive from
the new competition should go to the leagues of participating
teams.
	   ``With every meeting that we have there is more confidence
coming from the various parties,'' Aigner said after last week's
final task force meeting.
	   Also up for approval is a new-look UEFA Cup, combining the
existing UEFA Cup and Cup Winners Cup. It would start with 96
teams, the same number as the competitions it replaces.
	   The cup would be joined in its third round by eight teams
knocked out of the Champions League after finishing third in their
groups _ giving ``more quality,'' according to Aigner.
	   Under the new Champions League format, the first- and
second-placed teams from all eight groups would advance to a
two-leg, single-elimination second round before the quarterfinal
stage.
	   Countries whose teams reach the new UEFA Cup's quarterfinals
would receive an extra berth in the following season's competition.

Top Russian ministers to meet to work out budget
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: AMs. RECASTS, UPDATES thruout with fresh details, budget
estimates. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov finally sat down
with his government Wednesday to discuss an austere 1999 budget _
one of the toughest tests of his short tenure, and a task the
Cabinet has repeatedly postponed.
	   Primakov convened his top ministers behind closed doors to
discuss military spending before it took on the rest of the budget,
which is estimated at 575 billion rubles (dlrs 29 billion).
	   The job is not easy: The government must pay off huge debts to
foreign lenders and to Russian workers, while the country's
revenues are shrinking and no foreign aid has been promised to bail
it out.
	   The latest version of the budget, according to the Interfax news
agency, indicates that the government will cut expenditures
drastically and try to streamline the country's unwieldy tax
system.
	   Though austere, the budget draft still assumes a deficit of at
least 100 billion rubles (almost dlrs 5 billion).
	   Some budget projections even factor in loans from the
International Monetary Fund as part of 1999 revenues _ even though
the loans were frozen months ago.
	   The government intends to print 32.5 billion rubles (dlrs 1.6
billion) next year to cover part of the budget deficit, Finance
Minister Mikhail Zadornov said, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   He said nothing about how the government would finance the
remainder of the gap. Many analysts have warned the government may
end up printing a lot more money than it is willing to admit now _
and printing money is widely expected to stoke inflation.
	   In an interview published Wednesday, Primakov said the
government will probably not be able to pay off all of its dlrs
17.5 billion in foreign debts due next year, but he is still
promising to pay off all state workers.
	   Russia can pay off the workers by simply printing more rubles _
a method that wouldn't work with foreign debts.
	   Primakov said government control over the economy will be
stronger next year, but told foreign investors not to be scared
away.
	   ``Steps to protect domestic producers will in no way infringe on
foreign investment,'' he said in an interview with the Nezavisimaya
Gazeta newspaper.
	   The International Monetary Fund and other lenders froze a dlrs
22.6 billion loan package to Russia in August, after the government
defaulted on some of its debts and devalued the ruble.
	   Primakov's Cabinet will meet again Thursday, when it is expected
to approve the final budget draft and pass it along to the State
Duma, or lower house of parliament, for approval.
	   Many top officials were expecting swift passage for the budget.
Compared to previous governments, Primakov's team generally has
support in the Communist-dominated Duma.

Weightlifter returns positive test: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Jordanian weightlifter has returned a
positive test to a banned substance at the Asian Games, according
to a report from Japanese news agency Kyodo.
	   Quoting unnamed sources, Kyodo said Ayed Khawaldeh tested
positive for traces of diuretics, used for weight loss or to flush
other drugs out of the system.
	   A spokesman at the Jordanian delegation said the team would not
comment. Delegation chief Jawdat Abdel Muneem was not immediately
available.
	   The International Weightlifting Federation's penalty for
diuretic offenses is a two-year ban from competitions.
	   Khawaldeh, 25, contested the 56-kilogram division Monday and
finished seventh.
	   He was one of two Jordanian weightlifters at the games. The
other has not competed yet.

Britain allows Spain to start extradition of Pinochet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reaction from human rights group; combines pvs;
ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Home Secretary Jack Straw ruled Wednesday that
Spain can start extradition proceedings against former Chilean
dictator Augusto Pinochet to face charges of genocide, torture and
kidnapping.
	   In a statement, Straw said: ``I find an authority to proceed in
respect of Senator Pinochet today. The Spanish request for his
extradition will now be considered by the courts.''
	   The decision means that the 83-year-old Pinochet, under armed
guard at a mansion outside London, now faces months and possibly
years of battles through British courts fighting extradition.
	   His lawyers have said they may seek an urgent review before a
judge, arguing that Straw would be wrong on legal points to let
Spain have the general.
	   Straw had agonized over the decision since Britain's highest
court, the House of Lords, said in a 3-2 ruling Nov. 25 that
Pinochet has no immunity from arrest under English law. He made his
announcement two days before Friday's deadline.
	   Pinochet, a regular visitor to Britain, was arrested Oct. 16 on
a Spanish warrant seeking his extradition on charges of genocide,
kidnapping and torture during his 17-year rule. He overthrew an
elected Marxist, Salvador Allende, in a 1973 coup.
	   A Chilean government report says 3,197 people were murdered or
disappeared at the hands of Pinochet's secret police.
	   Straw's decision delighted human rights groups, victims of the
Pinochet years and most rank-and-file legislators in Britain's
governing Labor Party _ many of whom joined anti-Pinochet
demonstrations as young socialists in their student days.
	   ``We congratulate the Home Secretary on this difficult but
courageous decision which brings us one step closer to the day when
Pinochet will have to answer to his victims,'' said Reed Brody,
spokesman for the New York-based Human Rights Watch.
	   But the decision dealt a new blow to Britain's already strained
relations with Chile, which has waged a diplomatic battle for the
general's release partly because of fears that renewed tensions
between his supporters and opponents will threaten the country's
new democracy.
	   The decision also opened the prospect of a long legal fight by
an old man living _ and possibly dying _ under arrest in a foreign
country.
	   Pinochet remained at a mansion at Wentworth, some 20 miles (30
kms) west of London. He was moved there Dec. 1 after the north
London hospital where he spent more than a month said he did not
need medical attention. The hospital said he had overstayed his
welcome and demanded that he leave.
	   Pinochet, who arrived in September, was arrested in a central
London hospital where he had undergone back surgery.
	   He immediately claimed immunity from arrest as a former head of
state, and a three-judge panel of England's High Court unanimously
found in his favor Oct. 28. It ruled that Britain's 1978 State
Immunity Act was so sweeping that it gave all former heads of state
immunity from arrest for anything done in office.
	   Overturning the decision, three judges in the House of Lords
said that some crimes are heinous beyond immunity.
	   Pinochet's lawyers complained that a judge who tipped the
decision against him, South African-born Lord Justice Leonard
Hoffmann, is the director of the fund-raising arm of Amnesty
International, the British-based human rights group that has led
the campaign for Pinochet to be charged.

Teacher, vice principal suspended over high school strip search
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSVILLE, Ontario (AP) _ A gym teacher and vice principal have
been suspended while police investigate the strip search of 19 high
school students, authorities said Wednesday.
	   The two staff members conducted the search last week in a futile
effort to find money which one student claimed was stolen from him.
	   Val Pistor, director of education for the Greater Essex school
board, said John MacDonald, the vice principal who allowed the
strip search, admits he made a mistake and is devastated by the
incident.
	   Dan Bondy, the gym teacher involved in the search, is refusing
to comment until he gets a lawyer.
	   Both have been suspended with pay pending developments in
investigations by police and the school board.
	   The board has issued strict new guidelines for student searches.
From now on, teachers will only be able to ask students to turn
their pockets inside out or take off their shoes and socks.
	   Police must be called if a teacher wants a more intensive search
to be performed.
	   The controversy began last Friday, when 19 ninth-graders, aged
about 14, were taken one at a time into an office, ordered to
remove their pants, then told to bend over as Bondy and MacDonald
searched for missing money.
	   Ontario Premier Mike Harris, the father of sons aged 7 and 13,
condemned the acts as repulsive and abhorrent.
	   Recently, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled teachers and
principals have the right to search students on school premises if
they believe school rules are being broken.
	   But the court set guidelines on when searches are reasonable and
how they should be conducted.
	   Kingsville, a town of about 6,000, is about 25 miles (40
kilometers) southeast of Windsor, Ontario.

	   PARIS (AP) _ A man slipped past security cameras, barbed wire
and high fences and then walked 50 kilometers (30 miles) through
the undersea Channel Tunnel _ dodging high-speed trains _ from
Britain to France, where he was arrested Wednesday.
	   A stunned Eurotunnel spokeswoman said the company is ``very
worried'' by the incident, the first time a pedestrian has ever
managed to dodge security and walk from Britain to France.
	   French police said the 36-year-old Russian man, whom they did
not identify by name, entered the tunnel sometime over the weekend
on the English side of the Channel.
	   Nobody knew what his motive was. ``We will be very interested in
knowing why,'' said Dominique Maire, spokeswoman for Eurotunnel in
Paris.
	   He was detected and then arrested Wednesday while still inside
the tunnel as he prepared to surface at Coquelles, six kilometers
(four miles) west of Calais, where the trains emerge.
	   ``We are still asking ourselves how this man could have gotten
into the tunnel because it is under such great surveillance by
police and Eurotunnel security,'' said Maire.
	   The entrances to the tunnel on both sides of the Channel are
closely watched by TV cameras. Barbed wire and high fences have
been set up to keep trespassers out.
	   The tunnel was checked for damage after the incident and other
intruders, but nothing was found.
	   Inside the tunnel, the rails are very close together and trains
racing at speeds of up to 150 kilometers (92 miles) an hour whip up
winds that act like a vacuum cleaner and could scoop up a human
being.
	   French police said it was a miracle the man survived.
	   Eurotunnel believes the intruder sought safe refuge while trains
went by in cross passages, small openings that are placed every 375
meters (yards) inside the tunnel.
	   Police already have returned the man to England, his point of
departure, where he now is being interrogated by British
immigration officers ``to ascertain his immigration status,'' a
British Home Office spokeswoman said on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The Russian Embassy in London said it was aware of the incident
but had no comment.
	   Millions of people take the train each year through the Channel
Tunnel, which opened in 1994.

European Commission formally proposes Russian food aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission on Wednesday
formally proposed an emergency food aid package to Russia worth
nearly a half-billion dollars.
	   The $460 milliion aid proposal by the Commission, the European
Union's executive branch, must now be approved by the 15 EU
member-nations and the European Parliament.
	   EU leaders are expected to discuss the aid at their two-day
summit starting Friday in Vienna, Austria, as part of a wider
debate on relations with Russia.
	   EU foreign ministers who agreed to back the package earlier this
week had insisted on tight controls to ensure the aid reaches the
needy _ not profiteers.
	   The ministers said they wanted independent monitoring of the
distribution of the aid, which includes hundreds of millions of
tons of grain, beef, milk powder and other basic foods. They also
demanded monthly reports from the Russian authorities.
	   In making its proposal, the EU Commission warned the risk of
abuse could not be ruled out despite the controls.
	   The Commission reiterated the case for the aid, saying nearly
half of Russia's 89 regions will have grain shortages this winter.
That is twice as high as a Commission estimate in mid-November.
	   The food aid will be sold in Russia at market prices, and
profits used to fund social projects.
	   The EU has been debating Russian aid since Nov. 9, four days
after the United States announced a $600 million food aid package
for Russia.
	   Russia's worst grain harvest in 40 years, coming on the heels of
the summer's financial collapse, has sent prices rising 50 percent
and prompted fears the poor won't be able to afford food throughout
the winter.

Greece defends deportation of Syrian who claimed to face death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece on Wednesday defended its
deportation of a Syrian drug trafficker who claimed he faced death
at home.
	   Mohammed Dokuz, who was deported Tuesday, was released from
prison last year after serving a sentence for drug trafficking. He
was held in detention pending deportation.
	   ``The rules which apply in our country were absolutely
respected,'' said government spokesman Dimitris Reppas.
	   The government has come under criticism for allegedly holding a
double standard by deporting Dokuz and opposing the extradition of
Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan to Turkey, where he could face
a death sentence. Ocalan was arrested in Rome last month.
	   There were few details on Dokuz's claims that he allegedly faced
death in Syria. Some Greek media reported Dokuz was an military
deserter, while other reports said he was wanted on drug charges.
	   When Greek courts convict and sentence foreigners for felonies,
such as drug trafficking, they usually also order their deportation
following their release from prison.
	   Dokuz, who arrived in Greece in 1989, was assessed to be a
refugee by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. But Greece
apparently did not recognize his refugee status.
	   ``We asked the government not to send him back,'' said UNHCR
representative Janvier de Riedmatten.
	   He added that Greece should have spent more time looking into
Dokuz's claims that he faced the death penalty ``instead of using
mostly procedural explanations.''
	   But Riedmatten said that governments ``are not bound by UNHCR
assessments.''

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss politicians on Wednesday elected
Interior Minister Ruth Dreifuss as the country's president for
1999, making her the first woman and first Jew ever to lead the
government.
	   Women welcomed the election, which came less than 30 years after
female citizens won the right to vote.
	   ``After decades of the struggle for equality, the doors are
finally opening to women,'' Dreifuss told about 150 women who
gathered in front of the parliament building. ``Today we confirm
that we want this equality and that we are going to get it step by
step.''
	   An assembly of the two houses of parliament approved Dreifuss'
appointment in a secret ballot by 158 votes out of a possible 210.
	   Dreifuss' ethnic background has not been an issue, even though
the government has reported an increase in anti-Semitism in
Switzerland following pressure from international Jewish groups to
compensate the heirs of Holocaust victims who left assets in Swiss
banks.
	   Dreifuss, a non-practising Jew, has kept a low profile during
the controversy, which peaked in August before the two largest
banks agreed to a dlrs 1.25 billion settlement of World War II
claims.
	   She has been in line for the one-year presidency since last
December, when she was elected vice president.
	   Dreifuss, 58, of the left-of-center Social Democrats, replaces
Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti in the largely ceremonial post, which
rotates on an annual basis among the seven members of the coalition
Cabinet.
	   Defense Minister Adolf Ogi, who was president five years ago,
will be her deputy, putting him in line to assume the presidency
again in 2000.
	   Christiane Brunner, a more controversial Social-Democrat who was
rejected in 1993, congratulated her political ``twin sister''
Wednesday and said she had no regrets that she lost out.
	   Dreifuss is only the second woman to be elected to the Federal
Council, or Cabinet, and is its only female member.
	   An economist and expert on social security, she had charge of
health and social issues. Dreifuss has overseen Switzerland's drug
policy, introducing measures to give heroin to long-term addicts.
	   ``The struggle continues,'' she said, adding that she hopes she
will be not remain the only woman in the Cabinet.

Chekhov museum might be closed down over debts, director says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A museum devoted to the famous Russian
author and playwright Anton Chekhov in the Ukrainian city of Yalta
may soon be closed down over debts, the museum director said.
	   In an interview published Wednesday in the newspaper Fakty,
Hennady Shaliugin said the museum owes 13,500 hryvna (about dlrs
4,000) to guards provided by the Interior Ministry of Ukraine's
Black Sea peninsula of Crimea.
	   Shaliugin said he was summoned to an arbitration court in the
regional capital, Simferopol, and was told that the museum property
and bank accounts would be seized if the debt was not settled by
Dec. 15.
	   The museum, established by Chekhov's sister, is located in the
author's former house, which survived the Nazi occupation during
World War II.
	   ``What our enemies did not manage to do we're planning to do
ourselves,'' Shaliugin said bitterly.
	   Authorities at the museum, which contains more than 20,000
pieces of Chekhov memorabilia, have no money to pay the debts or
properly maintain the building. The workers have not received their
pay for the past three months and some rooms badly need repair,
Shaliugin said.
	   The bad news hit the museum as it was preparing for next April's
events celebrating 100 years since Chekhov settled in Yalta.
Chekhov, famous for his short stories and such classic plays as
``Uncle Vanya'' and ``The Seagull,'' died in Germany in 1904.
	   Another Crimean museum to a Russian 20th century novelist,
Sergei Sergeyev-Tsensky, already has been closed down by an
arbitration court because of debts, Fakty said.

	   BERLIN (AP) _ Germans used to high prices, rude sales clerks and
long lines at the checkout take heart: Wal-Mart said Wednesday it's
coming to the rescue with an American-style, ``friendly shopping
experience.''
	   The U.S. retail giant said it is buying 74 superstores from the
Spar supermarket chain, dramatically increasing its presence in
Europe's biggest economy despite years of flat sales in the
retailing sector.
	   With competition getting tougher, hypermarkets _ combining
groceries with electronics, clothing and other goods _ have been
spreading across Europe.
	   Those behemoths offer lower prices but in a warehouse-like
environment with little in the way of sales help and too few
checkouts, contrasting with the Germany tradition of standard
pricing and trained staff.
	   Enter Wal-Mart, which has perfected the superstore concept in
small towns across America. It made its first jump into Europe a
year ago, buying 21 stores in Germany from the Wertkauf chain.
	   With price wars already underway among the German giants, the
Americans have focused on an innovation Germans have only started
to discover: improving service.
	   Wal-Mart is opening its stores earlier, adding staff, offering
more goods and putting more emphasis on product displays.
	   While Wal-Mart may not be able to undercut the competition by
much, ``they are making things brighter,'' said Stefan Schneider of
the Association of German Retailers.
	   ``Competitors will either have to do the same thing or come up
with their own new ideas,'' Schneider said.
	   But Bob Martin, president and CEO of Wal-Mart International,
believes no one knows what customers want better than Wal-Mart.
	   ``They want a fun and friendly shopping experience,'' he said.
``They don't want to wait in long lines to buy merchandise. And
when the day is done, they want to be appreciated by the stores
where they spend their money. ...
	   ``As we begin to achieve critical mass in this market, the
customer is the winner,'' he said.
	   And Wal-Mart is not stopping at Germany.
	   ``Our activities in the German market mark a start into a
Europe-wide expansion,'' Martin said.
	   He declined to say what European country was next on Wal-Mart's
shopping list. But with more than 2,000 stores in the United States
already, Wal-Mart sees its largest growth potential overseas, he
said.
	   The deal for the 74 German stores, which have around 3 billion
marks (dlrs 1.7 billion) in combined annual sales, will become
effective Dec. 31, pending approval by government regulators.
	   Wal-Mart and Spar agreed not to reveal the selling price, both
sides said.

In wake of scandal, ICC calls for greater power to police sport
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Richards' quotes in 10th graf &QL; 
 &UR; BY STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The head of cricket's world governing body on
Wednesday said the scandal surrounding Australian stars Shane Warne
and Mark Waugh was ``an embarrassment to the game'' and called for
greater powers to police the sport.
	   Pakistani cricketer Salim Malik, meanwhile, promised to sue the
two Australians, both of whom have accused him of match-fixing.
	   Former England captain Geoffrey Boycott, however, wasn't
surprised. He said what Warne and Waugh had done was common
practice, particularly in Asia.
	   Warne and Waugh, two of cricket's biggest stars, admitted on
Wednesday they were secretly fined by the Australian Cricket Board
for accepting money in 1994 from Indian bookmakers. They supplied
information on the pitch and weather conditions in Pakistan during
a tour against Sri Lanka and Pakistan.
	   The coverup _ as much as the money payments _ has sullied the
ACB and the London-based Internationl Cricket Council, which also
knew about the fines.
	   ``The image of the game is very important to everyone,'' David
Richards, ICC chief executive, said Wednesday. ``And these
situations should not have happened.''
	   ``It's something that has damaged the image of the game of
cricket,'' he said. ``When they do happen we need to face up to
them, deal with them sternly and them move on to make sure the next
generation of players don't find themselves in these situations.''
	   Richards defended the ICC's silence and said the organization's
powers were limited at the time.
	   ``In 1995 the powers were increased and I note that (ACB
chairman) Malcolm Speed is suggesting today that countries give the
ICC greater powers,'' Richards said.
	   ``At the time that this blew up in 1995, the structure of the
ICC wasn't what it is now. Historically, each country has had the
sovereign right to deal with its own players on discipline.''
	   He said the controversy was sure to top the agenda at the ICC's
executive board meetings next month in Christchurch, New Zealand.
	   In Lahore, Pakistan, Malik promised to sue the Australian pair
and suggested the case proved his innocence.
	   ``I am definitely going to take a legal action against Shane
Warne and Mark Waugh,'' Malik said. ``I have suffered so much
because of these false charges by these Australian cricketers. They
have really upset me and have spoiled my cricket for the last two
years.''
	   A court in Pakistan is looking into match-fixing charges against
Malik and former captain Wasim Akram. Australian Tim May, along
with Warne and Waugh, said Malik offered them thousands of dollars
to throw a match in 1994.
	   Former England cricket captain Geoffrey Boycott said it ``was
common knowledge'' that certain players in Asia gave bookmakers
pitch and weather information on mobile phones before matches.
	   ``It's fairly common knowledge that certain players have, on
their mobiles, given information to bookies about the pitch
conditions and the weather and who's likely to bat first and how
the match is likely to go,'' Boycott said.
	   ``Bookies out there where the betting is huge can alter the
odds,'' he added. ``It does them a favor, but it doesn't really
alter what's going to happen in the game.
	   ``But it doesn't sound right, does it?''
	   Boycott said the ICB and ACB made the situation worse by
covering it up.
	   ``Once you have a coverup, it never looks good,'' Boycott said.
``It leaves a nasty taste. The ACB amazes me. Can you believe the
Australian Cricket Board covering it up for that time?''
	   Former England and Kent wicketkeeper Godfrey Evans said he was
stunned by the news. Evans used to be the cricket oddsmaker for
British bookmakers Ladbrokes.
	   ``I'm very sorry to hear that,'' he said. ``I thought it was the
Pakistanis who were in trouble with the Australians bringing the
charges. It's very regrettable.''
	   Graham Cowdrey, a former Kent batsman and now cricket oddsmaker
for the betting firm City Index, said he was ``staggered.''
	   ``In my 15 years of playing first-class cricket in England I
never came across anything like this,'' he said.

Romanian prime minister doesn't get support from unions

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with talks breaking down, unions to protest Thursday

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Talks between Prime Minister Radu
Vasile and the country's main trade unions broke down Wednesday and
unions said they would stage street protests to show their
dissatisfaction at falling living standards.
	   Vasile met the leaders of several trade unions Wednesday to ask
them to hold off on organizing street protests for six months while
reforms are implemented, said Elena Marinescu, spokeswoman for the
Ministry of Industry and Trade.
	   After four hours of talks, union leader Dumitru Costin said the
government lacked credibility with labor and its proposed reforms
would mean delayed wages, unpaid bills and no bonuses, national
agency Rompres reported.
	   His union members will march through the capital and the city of

 &UR; Romanian prime minister doesn't get support from unions

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Talks between Prime Minister Radu
Vasile and the country's main trade unions broke down Wednesday and
unions said they would stage street protests to show their
dissatisfaction at falling living standards.
	   Vasile met the leaders of several trade unions Wednesday to ask
them to hold off on organizing street protests for six months while
reforms are implemented, said Elena Marinescu, spokeswoman for the
Ministry of Industry and Trade.
	   After four hours of talks, union leader Dumitru Costin said the
government lacked credibility with labor and its proposed reforms
would mean delayed wages, unpaid bills and no bonuses, national
agency Rompres reported.
	   His union members will march through the capital and the city of
Brasov Thursday to underscore their discontent.
	   Costin heads the National Trade Union Bloc which has 600,000
members. Earlier, Marin Condescu, leader of the Miners Unions
Confederation, said that government reforms were merely
``gift-wrapped promises.''

Defying U.N. pressure, Yugoslavia goes ahead with massacre probe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Defying U.N. pressure to extradite
three former Serb officers charged with war crimes, Yugoslavia
pressed ahead Wednesday with its own probe, making them witnesses
rather than suspects.
	   The three Serbs sought by the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The
Hague, Netherlands _ Veselin Sljivancanin, Miroslav Radic and Milan
Mrksic _ are accused of ordering the 1991 massacre of 261 Croats
taken out of a hospital in Vukovar in eastern Croatia.
	   Refusing to hand over the officers, the Military Court in
Belgrade said it would hold its own probe against ``unknown
persons'' involved in the Vukovar massacre. It added that the three
officers would be questioned only as witnesses and not as suspects.
	   Prosecutors from the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal plan to ask
judges Wednesday to order Belgrade authorities to stop their
investigation of the massacre and hand over any evidence they have
collected.
	   On Tuesday, chief prosecutor Louise Arbour accused Belgrade of
setting up show proceedings to prevent the three from being
extradited for trial before the U.N. court in The Hague.
	   Given Yugoslavia's track record of defying the tribunal, the
case appears ``designed to shield the accused from international
criminal responsibility,'' Arbour wrote.
	   The Yugoslav military prosecutor rejected the tribunal's charges
against the three as ``unfounded'' and invited the men as witnesses
during the investigation, the state news agency Tanjug reported.
	   The independent Belgrade news agency Beta, citing a Military
Court document, said the probe will be held Dec. 17 in Belgrade. It
added that representatives from the Hague tribunal had been invited
to attend the proceedings.
	   The Military Court president has requested the tribunal's files
on the three men, which form the basis for their indictment by the
tribunal, Tanjug reported.
	   The tribunal has made no official response to the request.
	   Judge Gabrielle Kirk McDonald, president of the Hague tribunal,
Tuesday accused the government of President Slobodan Milosevic of
``unabashedly obstructing the explicit directives of the Security
Council.''
	   She was referring to repeated Security Council demands to
extradite the three.
	   She asked the Security Council to determine ``the appropriate
measures'' to take against Belgrade, beyond its previous
condemnation of Yugoslavia's failure to cooperate with war crimes
investigators. The council also should demand the arrest of the
three men, who are charged with organizing a massacre, she said.
	   But Russia, which has close political ties to Yugoslavia,
blocked even a press statement from the council president
condemning Yugoslavia's latest failure to cooperate with war crimes
investigators, diplomats said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   McDonald said the decision by the Military Court in Belgrade to
conduct an investigation of war crimes at the Vukovar hospital was
in direct contravention of a Security Council resolution and the
tribunal, which has primacy over national courts.
	   Yugoslavia, which consists of Serbia and Montenegro, has refused
to extradite its citizens sought by the tribunal, citing a
constitutional ban on extradition.

Deutsche Telekom under investigation by anti-trust watchdog
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's anti-trust watchdog revealed
Wednesday it is investigating Deutsche Telekom on suspicion of
charging competitors unfair fees for accessing its directory data.
	   Deutsche Telekom, the former telephone monopoly that is now
partly privatized, charges a fixed rate for its directory data. The
Federal Cartel Office wants it to adjust the rate based on usage or
market share.
	   A spokesman for the Berlin-based cartel office said the fixed
pricing hindered new operators from joining the market because of
the initial high costs.
	   He said the investigation started in the middle of the year, and
that Deutsche Telekom said it would respond to the allegations in
writing on Dec. 15. He gave no timetable for a final ruling in the
case.
	   Deutsche Telekom declined to provide further details of current
talks with the cartel office.
	   Telekom lost it monopoly Jan. 1 with the liberalization of
Germany's telecommunications market in keeping with European Union
standards. But it still has a virtual monopoly on customer profile
data, the cartel spokesman explained.
	   According to the cartel office, Deutsche Telekom charges
competitors up to 170 million marks (dlrs 100 million) if they want
to offer the same full-range directory assistance Telekom does. For
that fee, a competitor could use Telekom data to provide directory
assistance, telephone books and CD-roms.

Libyan passengers commandeer Egyptian airliner in mid-air
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS for AMs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan passengers took over a chartered
Egyptian airliner in mid-air Wednesday, demanding to be flown to
Libya in violation of U.N. sanctions. The drama ended hours later
in Tunisia where the plane eventually landed and the protesters
left the plane peacefully.
	   Two masked men burst into the cockpit of the MD-90 aircraft soon
after it took off from Yemen for Tunis, Tunisia, and asked to be
flown to the Libyan capital Tripoli, Egyptian security officials
said.
	   Many of the estimated 150 Libyans on board joined the masked
intruders and created a ruckus, the officials said quoting the
pilot who was in radio touch with Cairo airport. The officials
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   One Egyptian police official said the pilot was told by Egyptian
authorities that he could fly to Libya under duress without
violating sanctions, but the pilot apparently tricked the hijackers
and landed in Jerba, a Tunisian island about 80 kilometers (50
miles) from Libya's northwest border.
	   Some passengers got off the plane in Jerba complaining of
exhaustion while many others remained on board demanding that the
aircraft be refueled, the officials said. But they too left the
aircraft later without further trouble, said the officials.
	   No other details were available and it was not clear if any of
the passengers had been taken into custody at the Jerba airport
where they were apparently holed up.
	   The aircraft was chartered by a private Egyptian company for a
flight by Libyan businessmen, the officials said. They said the
aircraft itself belongs to EgyptAir, the national carrier, and that
Tunisian and Yemeni passengers also were aboard.
	   None of the passengers or crew was reported injured. Officials
said many of the passengers were carrying daggers, as is the custom
among Libyan and Yemeni men, but they did not use it to threaten
the crew.
	   Libya has frequently violated the U.N. flight ban, which was
adopted in 1992 to force Libya to turn over two suspects wanted for
the bombing of an Pan Am jet over Scotland in 1988.
	   Jerba, an island 350 kilometers (210 miles) south of the capital
Tunis, is frequently used as a transit point for travelers going on
to Libya by land without violating the sanctions.

British embassy dismisses accusations by Yugoslav official
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The British embassy on Wednesday
dismissed allegations by Yugoslav officials of meddling in
country's internal affairs by inviting reporters from Kosovo to
attend a journalism seminar.
	   David Landsman, deputy head of British embassy in Belgrade, told
B-92 radio that he was ``surprised'' at accusations by Information
Minister Goran Matic who said the embassy diplomats had overstepped
their diplomatic mission by cooperating with non-government media
in Yugoslavia.
	   Matic late Tuesday accused the embassy of ``performing jobs that
are not in the domain of diplomacy,'' adding those were ``giving
instructions, inducing, supplying material and other support.''
	   Matic cited an invitation to six journalists from Kosovo to
attend a journalism seminar in Great Britain. Organization of the
trip has been coordinated through an independent media association
in Serbia.
	   Matic called the move ``meddling in Yugoslavia's internal
political affairs.''
	   The Association of Independent Electronic Media, said the
government accusations also presented an attempt to disqualify the
group, an umbrella organization for most of Serbia's fledgling
local radio and television stations.
	   Serbia is the dominant republic in Yugoslavia, which also
includes Montenegro. A recent media law passed by the Serbian
government imposes censorship and severe punishment for
``anti-state'' activities.
	   Since the government launched a crackdown against ethnic
Albanian separatists in Kosovo earlier this year, it has sought to
tighten control over the independent media critical of the official
policies.
	   Matic accused the media association, known as ANEM, of working
under instructions from the British embassy. Matic warned such
behavior was unacceptable and will be ``sharply condemned.''
	   But Landsman said contacts of embassy staff with independent
media is a usual practice in all countries of Eastern Europe.

Poland's army puts high price on post-Warsaw Pact property
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MONIKA SCISLOWSKA  &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ From shoestrings to military bunkers,
Poland's army is shedding off obsolete property and equipment as
the former Warsaw Pact nation prepares to join NATO in April.
	   But an auction Wednesday of military property around the country
indicated that some of the prices are too high.
	   Only one of eight properties sold _ a complex including a
garage, warehouse, gas station and workshop buildings in the
central city of Pulawy that attracted slightly above the opening
price of 8 million zlotys (dlrs 2.3 million).
	   ``It was a disillusionment because there were many potential
bidders,'' said Andrzej Jamrozek, chairman of the Military Property
Agency set up last year to sell the unneeded items. ``We see now
that the military property market is not so unusual.''
	   The idea is simple. With Poland having to change its military
structure and equipment to become a member of the Western alliance,
it can raise money to help pay for the required changes by selling
off the surplus.
	   Most of the proceeds _ 70 percent _ go to the Defense Ministry
and the rest helps fund Jamrozek's agency.
	   Defense Minister Janusz Onyszkiewicz, appearing appropriately
prudent, said the money has yet to be designated for any specific
purpose. It could pay for any urgent or unexpected expenses as the
military prepares for NATO membership, he said.
	   Changes in communications and air defense systems are among the
requirements for joining NATO.
	   Previous sales of items such as shoe strings, construction
equipment, mobile electricity generators and kitchens have raised 2
million zlotys (dlrs 580,000) for the ministry, and Jamrozek hopes
to get it another 18 million zlotys (dlrs 5.2 million) this month.
	   He needs a better outcome than Wednesday, when the single sale
fell far short of his goal of raising at least 67 million zlotys
(dlrs 19.4 million).
	   Wlodzimierz Wapinski, a potential bidder who owns a chemical
company in southern Poland, complained the prices were ``too
high.'' He wanted to pay 200,000 zlotys (dlrs 58,000) for a laundry
house in Gliwice, but the opening price was 440,000 zlotys (dlrs
127,000).
	   Jamrozek blamed independent appraisers for the pricing and said
another auction of the unsold properties in January would start
with lower prices.
	   The agency expects more success Thursday, when it auctions off a
34-hectare (84-acre) plot in Gluchow Gorny, 350 kilometers (210
miles) southwest of Warsaw.
	   It includes an air-conditioned nuclear shelter 15 meters (50
feet) underground that formerly was a Warsaw Pact secret war
headquarters and now could be a nice wine cellar, the agency notes.
The opening bid price is 800,000 zlotys (dlrs 231,000).
	   Agency spokesman Wieslaw Rozbicki said some property sells well,
such as barracks and other buildings close to Poland's western
border with Germany. NATO membership means a reduction in Polish
bases along the border with its new ally.
	   Military airports don't sell, he said, because they often cannot
be subdivided or developed for other uses.
	   He also said some Soviet MIG jet fighters from the 1960s have
been sold as collectors' items, with an American buying three at
the scrap price of 20,000 zlotys (dlrs 5,700) each.

Chekhov museum might be closed down over debts, director says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A museum devoted to the famous Russian
author and playwright Anton Chekhov in the Ukrainian city of Yalta
may soon be closed down over debts, the museum director said.
	   In an interview published Wednesday in the newspaper Fakty,
Hennady Shaliugin said the museum owes 13,500 hryvna (about dlrs
4,000) to guards provided by the Interior Ministry of Ukraine's
Black Sea peninsula of Crimea.
	   Shaliugin said he was summoned to an arbitration court in the
regional capital, Simferopol, and was told that the museum property
and bank accounts would be seized if the debt was not settled by
Dec. 15.
	   The museum, established by Chekhov's sister, is located in the
author's former house, which survived the Nazi occupation during
World War II.
	   ``What our enemies did not manage to do we're planning to do
ourselves,'' Shaliugin said bitterly.
	   Authorities at the museum, which contains more than 20,000
pieces of Chekhov memorabilia, have no money to pay the debts or
properly maintain the building. The workers have not received their
pay for the past three months and some rooms badly need repair,
Shaliugin said.
	   The bad news hit the museum as it was preparing for next April's
events celebrating 100 years since Chekhov settled in Yalta.
Chekhov, famous for his short stories and such classic plays as
``Uncle Vanya'' and ``The Seagull,'' died in Germany in 1904.
	   Another Crimean museum to a Russian 20th century novelist,
Sergei Sergeyev-Tsensky, already has been closed down by an
arbitration court because of debts, Fakty said.

in direct contravention of a Security Council resolution and the
tribunal, which has primacy over national courts.
	   Yugoslavia, which consists of Serbia and Montenegro, has refused
to extradite its citizens sought by the tribunal, citing a
constitutional ban on extradition.

	   PARIS (AP) _ A man slipped past security cameras, barbed wire
and high fences and then walked 50 kilometers (30 miles) through
the undersea Channel Tunnel _ dodging high-speed trains _ from
Britain to France, where he was arrested Wednesday.
	   A stunned Eurotunnel spokeswoman said the company is ``very
worried'' by the incident, the first time a pedestrian has ever
managed to dodge security and walk from Britain to France.
	   French police said the 36-year-old Russian man, whom they did
not identify by name, entered the tunnel sometime over the weekend
on the English side of the Channel.
	   Nobody knew what his motive was. ``We will be very interested in
knowing why,'' said Dominique Maire, spokeswoman for Eurotunnel in
Paris.
	   He was detected and then arrested Wednesday while still inside
the tunnel as he prepared to surface at Coquelles, six kilometers
(four miles) west of Calais, where the trains emerge.
	   ``We are still asking ourselves how this man could have gotten
into the tunnel because it is under such great surveillance by
police and Eurotunnel security,'' said Maire.
	   The entrances to the tunnel on both sides of the Channel are
closely watched by TV cameras. Barbed wire and high fences have
been set up to keep trespassers out.
	   The tunnel was checked for damage after the incident and other
intruders, but nothing was found.
	   Inside the tunnel, the rails are very close together and trains
racing at speeds of up to 150 kilometers (92 miles) an hour whip up
winds that act like a vacuum cleaner and could scoop up a human
being.
	   French police said it was a miracle the man survived.
	   Eurotunnel believes the intruder sought safe refuge while trains
went by in cross passages, small openings that are placed every 375
meters (yards) inside the tunnel.
	   Police already have returned the man to England, his point of
departure, where he now is being interrogated by British
immigration officers ``to ascertain his immigration status,'' a
British Home Office spokeswoman said on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The Russian Embassy in London said it was aware of the incident
but had no comment.
	   Millions of people take the train each year through the Channel
Tunnel, which opened in 1994.

Arafat on prisoners: Let Palestinian `heroes' go
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Israel-Palestinians &QL; 
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Prisoners Israel regards as murderers
are ``heroes,'' Yasser Arafat told cheering crowds Wednesday, four
days before U.S. President Bill Clinton arrives in the region to
prop up the teetering peace accord he helped broker.
	   Palestinians rioted Wednesday throughout the West Bank, the
fourth day of violence sparked by Israel's refusal to release
prisoners detained on terrorist charges.
	   ``We tell our heroes in the prisons we will not close our eyes
until we see them in front of our eyes,'' Arafat told about 1,000
people attending a conference of his Fatah faction.
	   The crowd cheered, ``If you want fighters, we will be your
fighters.''
	   Netanyahu has repeatedly denied that he agreed to release
Palestinians convicted of attacks on Israelis. He has sworn not to
release ``murderers.''
	   ``Why would anyone who declares that he wants peace would want
to release these type of people?'' Israeli government spokesman
Moshe Fogel said, in reaction to Arafat's remarks.
	   Arafat told the crowd that during the Wye River negotiations in
October, Clinton even named some of the security prisoners to be
released.
	   The Clinton Administration was scrambling to salvage the Wye
agreement before the president's arrival on Saturday. U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright demanded that Israel and the
Palestinians stick to its terms.
	   Her appeals _ and a firefighting visit to the region by top U.S.
Mideast envoy Dennis Ross _ appeared to go unheeded. Netanyahu
continued to insist that a troop withdrawal scheduled for next week
would be delayed.
	   Arafat told his followers that he had defied a plea by Ross to
avoid angering Israelis by not referring in public to a possible
unilateral declaration of statehood.
	   ``They told me not to use or say the word state,'' he said. ``I
told we have said it already and that is it.''
	   In a dig at Israeli apprehensions about the Clinton visit,
Arafat said he believed he had Clinton's implicit backing for
statehood in any case.
	   ``There are six ministers in the Israeli government who do not
welcome his coming,'' Arafat said of Clinton. ``He insists on
coming because he recognizes this people and homeland.''
	   ``We welcome the president's visit unequivocally,'' Fogel
countered.
	   Arafat pressed another button by pledging that Jerusalem _ which
Israel says will remain entirely under its sovereignty _ will one
day be Palestine's capital.
	   ``Jerusalem is the capital of the Palestinian state,'' Arafat
said.
	   On Wednesday _ the 11th anniversary of their uprising against
Israel _ hundreds of Palestinians stoned Israeli troops and
motorists throughout the West Bank.
	   Soldiers responded with rubber bullets, live rounds and tear
gas, killing a Palestinian teen-ager and injuring 69 others. Three
Israeli civilians and two Israeli troops were lightly hurt by
stones.
	   ``I am happy that this meeting is being held in view of the hard
challenges that you face every day from the Israeli army, the
settlers,'' Arafat said, alluding to the recent swell of violence.
	   That kind of statement indicated that the Palestinian Authority
_ despite its insistent denials _ was behind the violence,
according to the Israel government spokesman.
	   ``It is hypocritical to incite and encourage violence to be
directed at Israelis,'' Fogel said, ``and then bemoan the
consequences when Palestinians are injured in the course of this
violence.''

U.S. diplomat calls for urgent economic reforms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AIDA CERKEZ-ROBINSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnia must get rid itself
of its communist era financial structures and develop a
self-sustainable market economy soon or foreign businesses will
stay out, a senior U.S. diplomat said on Wednesday.
	   ``Bosnia-Herzegovina can no longer live on foreign aid,'' Robert
Gelbard said. ``The time of foreign aid has peaked and has begun to
decline.''
	   But if an appropriate business climate is not soon created, he
added, the aid will not be replaced by foreign investments and
business since potential investors are reluctant to do business
here.
	   ``The reasons were obvious: corruption, lack of adequate rule of
law, bad business climate,'' he said.
	   Gelbard urged local leaders to speed up their work in two
fundamental areas: privatization and the need for the development
of a new payment system in this country.
	   The current payment bureaus are instruments of state control
over the means of production, Gelbard said. ``They demonstrate a
system which is not used anywhere else in the World and show
medieval business practices.''
	   Banks do not operate like banks anywhere else in the world.
There are no checking accounts here, no use of credit cards, no
automatic banking machines, he said.
	   ``These are symbols, they are real, but they are symbols that
demonstrate that these structures are useless and over time need to
be replaced by new structures, so Bosnia-Herzegovina can join the
rest of Europe and the world,'' he said.
	   It is a natural evolution this country should be going through
and the key word in the process is transparency, he said.
	   Gelbard accused Bosnian Serb President Nikola Poplasen of
working against his own people by wanting to remove the pro-western
prime minister, Milorad Dodik.
	   Dodik recently made a move to reduce the influence of the
Yugoslav dinar in his part of Bosnia and raise the one of the new
common Bosnian currency that has been introduced recently.
	   Four different currencies were circulating around the country
and the new one was supposed to replace them.
	   The Muslim-Croat Federation switched to the new currency right
away, while the Bosnian Serbs in their half of the country remained
loyal to the Yugoslav dinar.
	   According to a World bank report, inflation in the first nine
month in the Muslim-Croat Federation has been almost zero. Thanks
to the new currency, Gelbard said.
	   In the same period, the Bosnian Serb half of the country
experienced a 30 percent inflation because they use the Yugoslav
dinar and make themselves dependent of the Belgrade-based Yugoslav
National bank that pursues a ``highly inflationary monetary
policy'' Gelbard cited the report.
	   Right now Serbia's most important export to the Bosnian Serbs is
inflation, he said. ``Not satisfied to destroy their own economy,
they are jealous of what's happening in Republika Srpska under the
Dodik government and they want to hurt theirs too.''

In wake of scandal, ICC calls for greater power to police sport
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING adding writethru designator &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Richards' quotes in 10th graf
 &UR; BY STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The head of cricket's world governing body on
Wednesday said the scandal surrounding Australian stars Shane Warne
and Mark Waugh was ``an embarrassment to the game'' and called for
greater powers to police the sport.
	   Pakistani cricketer Salim Malik, meanwhile, promised to sue the
two Australians, both of whom have accused him of match-fixing.
	   Former England captain Geoffrey Boycott, however, wasn't
surprised. He said what Warne and Waugh had done was common
practice, particularly in Asia.
	   Warne and Waugh, two of cricket's biggest stars, admitted on
Wednesday they were secretly fined by the Australian Cricket Board
for accepting money in 1994 from Indian bookmakers. They supplied
information on the pitch and weather conditions in Pakistan during
a tour against Sri Lanka and Pakistan.
	   The coverup _ as much as the money payments _ has sullied the
ACB and the London-based Internationl Cricket Council, which also
knew about the fines.
	   ``The image of the game is very important to everyone,'' David
Richards, ICC chief executive, said Wednesday. ``And these
situations should not have happened.''
	   ``It's something that has damaged the image of the game of
cricket,'' he said. ``When they do happen we need to face up to
them, deal with them sternly and them move on to make sure the next
generation of players don't find themselves in these situations.''
	   Richards defended the ICC's silence and said the organization's
powers were limited at the time.
	   ``In 1995 the powers were increased and I note that (ACB
chairman) Malcolm Speed is suggesting today that countries give the
ICC greater powers,'' Richards said.
	   ``At the time that this blew up in 1995, the structure of the
ICC wasn't what it is now. Historically, each country has had the
sovereign right to deal with its own players on discipline.''
	   He said the controversy was sure to top the agenda at the ICC's
executive board meetings next month in Christchurch, New Zealand.
	   In Lahore, Pakistan, Malik promised to sue the Australian pair
and suggested the case proved his innocence.
	   ``I am definitely going to take a legal action against Shane
Warne and Mark Waugh,'' Malik said. ``I have suffered so much
because of these false charges by these Australian cricketers. They
have really upset me and have spoiled my cricket for the last two
years.''
	   A court in Pakistan is looking into match-fixing charges against
Malik and former captain Wasim Akram. Australian Tim May, along
with Warne and Waugh, said Malik offered them thousands of dollars
to throw a match in 1994.
	   Former England cricket captain Geoffrey Boycott said it ``was
common knowledge'' that certain players in Asia gave bookmakers
pitch and weather information on mobile phones before matches.
	   ``It's fairly common knowledge that certain players have, on
their mobiles, given information to bookies about the pitch
conditions and the weather and who's likely to bat first and how
the match is likely to go,'' Boycott said.
	   ``Bookies out there where the betting is huge can alter the
odds,'' he added. ``It does them a favor, but it doesn't really
alter what's going to happen in the game.
	   ``But it doesn't sound right, does it?''
	   Boycott said the ICB and ACB made the situation worse by
covering it up.
	   ``Once you have a coverup, it never looks good,'' Boycott said.
``It leaves a nasty taste. The ACB amazes me. Can you believe the
Australian Cricket Board covering it up for that time?''
	   Former England and Kent wicketkeeper Godfrey Evans said he was
stunned by the news. Evans used to be the cricket oddsmaker for
British bookmakers Ladbrokes.
	   ``I'm very sorry to hear that,'' he said. ``I thought it was the
Pakistanis who were in trouble with the Australians bringing the
charges. It's very regrettable.''
	   Graham Cowdrey, a former Kent batsman and now cricket oddsmaker
for the betting firm City Index, said he was ``staggered.''
	   ``In my 15 years of playing first-class cricket in England I
never came across anything like this,'' he said.

Ukrainian parliament sets up commission on Lazarenko
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's parliament set up a commission
Wednesday to look into the arrest in Switzerland of former
Ukrainian prime minister Pavlo Lazarenko on money laundering
charges.
	   The commission, approved by a vote of 243-8, will be headed by
deputy speaker Viktor Medvedchuk and will also look into the
conduct of Ukraine's Foreign Ministry and other government
institutions in the case.
	   The Verkhovna Rada urged its speaker Oleksandr Tkachenko to
express lawmakers' concern over the arrest to Swiss authorities and
the Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly, and ask that the
case be resolved as soon as possible.
	   Lazarenko, now a centrist opposition legislator, was detained
last week upon entering Switzerland, and was charged last Friday in
connection with a ``relatively large'' sum of money.
	   On Tuesday, Lazarenko appeared before a Swiss court to deny
allegations of money laundering, while his supporters continued to
stage demonstrations in Kiev demanding his release.
	   The Geneva court will decide next Friday on the prosecution's
demands that Lazarenko be detained for an additional three months.
The defense is urging his release on bail of up to 5 million Swiss
francs (dlrs 3.6 million), saying the charges were insufficient.
	   Lazarenko has admitted moving money to Swiss accounts but
claimed he could prove it was not of criminal origin.
	   His backers in Ukraine say he is the victim of a political smear
campaign, and accuse the Ukrainian authorities of doing nothing to
help him.
	   Ukraine's Foreign Ministry, however, dismissed such criticism
Wednesday, saying it ``had done everything possible at this
stage,'' including verifying the circumstances of the arrest and
helping two lawmakers from Lazarenko's party to travel to
Switzerland.
	   Lazarenko has refused to meet with Ukrainian consular officers
in Geneva since the arrest.
	   He also was carrying a Panama passport, said First Deputy
Foreign Minister Oleksandr Chalyi. Ukraine, which has no dual
citizenship, has asked Panama to clarify whether such a passport
had been issued to Lazarenko, Chalyi said, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   Lazarenko was prime minister from 1996-97, and was then
dismissed by President Leonid Kuchma. Critics say Lazarenko reaped
huge profits from the distribution of natural gas supplies in the
former Soviet republic when he served as prime minister, but he and
his allies deny the charges.
	   In a statement Tuesday, Lazarenko's Hromada party said the
arrest in Switzerland was an ``unprecedented act of reprisal aimed
at discrediting an opposition leader.''
	   Lazarenko and his followers maintain that Ukrainian authorities
want to blacken his name before presidential elections in October
1999, and he has even accused Kuchma's close entourage of plotting
to kill him.
	   Hromada fared well in parliamentary elections this year and
Lazarenko was widely considered a top contender in the future
presidential race.
	   A Geneva judge, Laurent Kasper-Ansermet, is in Ukraine for the
investigation.

Last of Japan's Nakamuras falters; Wang takes gold for China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ South Korea harvested three judo gold
medals Wednesday at the Asian Games, while Olympic bronze medalist
Wang Xianbo ended China's drought with a dramatic victory over
Kimoto Nami of Japan.
	   Wang, 22, dominated Kimoto throughout the final bout of the
women's 63-kilogram category. But at the ring of the bell, Kimoto
cleanly threw Wang and the referee immediately pronounced the
Japanese the winner.
	   Wang, who said she had believed the match over and let down her
guard, knelt and wept with her head in her hands as the Chinese
team protested the decision.
	   After 10 minutes, the arbitration panel agreed, overruled the
referee and awarded her the gold. Kim Hwa-soo of Korea and Mei-ling
Wu of Taiwan shared the bronze.
	   South Korea took the other three gold medals at stake.
	   Yoo Sung-yeon upset the third of Japan's famed Nakamura brothers
competing in the Asian Games, 1993 world champion Yoshio, in the
90-kilogram category. The bronze was shared by D. Purevsuren of
Mongolia and Kamol Murodov of Uzbekistan.
	   In the men's 81-kilogram category, Cho In-chul beat North
Korea's Kwak Ok-chul. Sharing third were Kazem Sarikhani of Iran
and Ruslan Seilkhanov of Kazakhstan.
	   The women's 70-kilogram class gold was taken by Lim Jung-sook,
who defeated Miki Amao. The bronze went to Song Jianfeng of China
and Chen Chiu-ping of Taiwan.
	   Nakamura's defeat mirrored his Olympic champion brother Kenzo's
loss Tuesday to Haliun Boldbaatar of Mongolia in the 73-kilogram
class. Yukimasa Nakamura, an Olympic silver medalist, was the only
of the brothers to strike gold, on Monday. (pm-tjh)

European drug makers Zeneca and Astra confirm merger plans

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Sweden's Astra and Britain's Zeneca
confirmed today they will merge in a $37 billion deal that will
create one of the world's biggest drug manufacturers.
	   Astra is best known for Prilosec, an ulcer and heartburn
medication that's the world's top selling prescription drug. Zeneca
is the second biggest maker in the world of cancer drugs behind
U.S.-based Bristol-Myers Squibb.
	   The companies expect annual cost savings of $1.1 billion from
the new company, which will be called AstraZeneca. However, they
expect to incur about $1.2 billion in restructuring costs and cut
about 6,000 jobs, or 11 percent of their global workforce, in the
next three years.
	   The merger had been rumored for months. Confirmation boosted
Astra's shares by 12.9 percent, to 170.5 kronor (21 dlrs, 21 cents)
in trading Wednesday on Stockholm's bourse. Midway through the
session, the stock traded as high as 188 kronor (23 dlrs 38 cents),
up 24 percent.
	   Last week, Germany's Hoechst and France's Rhone-Poulenc agreed
to merge their drug and agrichemical businesses as the first step
toward a total merger. In France, Sanofi and Synthelabo recently
announced their $10 billion merger.
	   Behind all these mergers is the need to increase research
spending to compete with giants such as Pfizer, Glaxo Wellcome and
Merck, and the desire to pool resources to boost marketing.
	   ``If we are going to be competitive among world pharmaceutical
companies, we need this merger,'' said Hakan Mogren, chief
executive of Astra, who will be deputy chairman of the new company.
	   Sweden's Wallenberg family owns 12 percent of Astra, established
in 1913. The company is also the maker of lidocaine, one of the
leading local anesthesia drugs first developed in the 1940s.
	   While its best known for Prilosec, the drug is scheduled to lose
its patent protection in 2001. That will open the door for generic
firms to make a less expensive copy and slow the company's overall
sales growth.
	   Besides its cancer drugs, Zeneca also has a large agro-chemical
business and owns Salick Health Care, a U.S. operator of cancer
treatment and dialysis centers. Last year, the company marketed its
the migraine drug Zomig, which it bought from Glaxo Wellcome in
1995 while the drug was still being tested in humans.
	   But like Astra, Zeneca also has several drugs that are expected
to soon lose their patent protection. Analysts speculated that was
a leading factor influencing the merger.
	   The AstraZeneca corporate headquarters would be in London, the
research and development headquarters in Sweden.
	   The chairman of the new company would be Percy Barnevik, who
heads Investor AB, the investment arm of the Wallenberg family of
bankers and industrialists. Zeneca's top executive, Tom McKillop,
would be CEO.
	   The deal was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of
both companies.
	   Zeneca had $8.57 billion in sales in 1997 and has a current
market value of $38.62 billion. Astra posted $5.68 billion in sales
in 1997 and has a current market value of $24.48 billion.
	   Both companies had earnings of $1.2 billion in 1997.

<TEXT>
	   VAL D'ISERE, France (AP) _ Fritz Strobl led Wednesday's training
run in preparation for the first World Cup downhill of the season,
as the alpine ski circuit returns to European snow.
	   Strobl was the fastest down the 3,400-meter (11,154-foot)
Oreiller-Killy course, completing the opening training run in 1
minute, 59.48 seconds.
	   The 26-year-old Austrian, who won here last year, edged Italy's
Kristian Ghedina by 0.09 seconds.
	   Strobl's teammate Patrick Ortlieb clocked the third-fastest
time, crossing in 1:59.71, while compatriot Hermann Maier, double
Olympic champion, was fourth, 0.32 adrift.
	   Olympic downhill champion Jean-Luc Cretier of France, still
seeking his first career World Cup victory, finished a solid fifth,
0.44 back.
	   The Austrians, who have dominated the sport since the start of
the season, leading in all five disciplines, had five skiers in the
top ten, with Stephan Eberharter and Christian Greber finishing
seventh and ninth.
	   Italy was almost as successful with four skiers in the top ten,
including Luca Cattaneo in sixth and Pietro Vitalini in eighth.
	   The men will race the downhill on Saturday and a Super-G Sunday,
following the women's Super-G and giant slalom races Thursday and
Friday.
	   A second training run is set for Thursday.

	   PARIS (AP) _ National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen dismissed
his longtime lieutenant, Bruno Megret, from his party position
Wednesday, only hours after Megret defied him by calling for an
emergency party congress to solve their differences.
	   It was the latest rapid-fire development in the ugly feud
between Le Pen and his longtime lieutenant and heir apparent that
burst onto the surface over the weekend.
	   In a communique, Le Pen said he had named Carl Lang, the party's
vice president, as general delegate in place of Megret.

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Sweden's Astra and Britain's Zeneca
confirmed Wednesday they will merge in a dlrs 37 billion deal that
will create one of the world's biggest drug manufacturers.
	   Astra is best known for Prilosec, an ulcer and heartburn
medication that's the world's top selling prescription drug. Zeneca
is the second biggest maker in the world of cancer drugs behind
U.S.-based Bristol-Myers Squibb.
	   The companies expect annual cost savings of dlrs 1.1 billion
from the new company, which will be called AstraZeneca. However,
they expect to incur about dlrs 1.2 billion in restructuring costs
and cut about 6,000 jobs, or 11 percent of their global workforce,
in the next three years.
	   The merger had been rumored for months. Confirmation boosted
Astra's shares by 12.9 percent, to 170.5 kronor (21 dlrs, 21 cents)
in trading Wednesday on Stockholm's bourse. Midway through the
session, the stock traded as high as 188 kronor (23 dlrs 38 cents),
up 24 percent.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In a new challenge to the U.N. search for
illegal weapons in Iraq, a team of inspectors was turned back
Wednesday when it tried to enter a major office of the ruling Baath
Party, a key site of Saddam Hussein's government.
	   Richard Butler, head of the U.N. Special Commission, which
oversees inspections, called the Iraqi action ``a blockage.''
	   ``This was an absolutely legal no-notice inspection and they
blocked us,'' he told The Associated Press in New York.
	   The inspectors withdrew after an Iraqi official demanded that
they first provide a written declaration ``on the material and
items'' they sought, the official Iraqi News Agency said.
	   The incident _ which has the potential to blow into another
crisis _ came two days after Butler announced that he was ordering
the resumption of the so-called surprise inspections. On Tuesday,
the inspectors visited 32 sites.
	   Butler said the Iraqi demand for a written notice is ``simply
wrong'' and ``nonsense.''
	   Iraq, which had suspended the inspections in August, allowed
them to resume only last month, averting a military strike by the
United States and Britain. The two countries have left an armada in
the Gulf to ensure Iraq abides by its promise to cooperate fully
with the inspectors.
	   The United States reacted cautiously to Iraq's action Wednesday.
David Leavy, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said
the administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton awaits an
assessment by Butler next week of Iraq's overall compliance with
U.N. requirements.
	   ``As the president has said, if UNSCOM cannot do its job
effectively, we remain poised to act,'' Leavy said. He declined to
say what would trigger U.S. military action.
	   UNSCOM must certify that Iraq has eliminated its chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons as well as long-range missiles
before U.N. economic sanctions can be lifted.

Top Serbian officials: American plan for Kosovo unacceptable
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Senior Serbian officials on
Wednesday formally rejected an American plan for Kosovo,
reiterating support for a Serb draft which keeps the majority
ethnic Albanian province firmly within the republic.
	   In a statement issued after a meeting between President Milan
Milutinovic, top government officials and representatives of some
of Kosovo's minor ethnic groups said the U.S. plan for the region
was ``not acceptable.''
	   The statement carried by Tanjug news agency offered little
detail of the rejection, but said the American draft ``does not
rely upon key elements'' from the Serb plan, in an indication it
envisages loosening of Serbia's grip over Kosovo.
	   ``Numerous remarks and suggestions have been adopted, which
present response to the paper and a constructive contribution to
further coordination of the framework for the political solution,''
the statement added, again without elaboration.
	   Serbia's top politicians welcomed ``good hearted ideas'' in
finding solution for Kosovo, but reiterated the solution can only
be found in direct talks.
	   ``The form for solving the problem in Kosovo is widest possible
democratic self-rule within the legal system of Serbia and
Yugoslavia,'' and with equal rights for all ethnic groups in the
province, as envisaged in the Serb proposal, the statement said.
	   A top Serbian official in Kosovo, Veljko Odalovic, said
Wednesday the U.S. plan, drafted by envoy Christopher Hill, was
unacceptable because it ``brings into question'' the territorial
integrity of Serbia and Yugoslavia.
	   Earlier this week ethnic Albanian politicians in Kosovo also
rejected the American plan saying it was pro-Serb.
	   The Serbian officials also called for a census in Kosovo as soon
as possible.

Venezuela stocks soar after former coup leader wins presidency
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEVEN GUTKIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ President-elect Hugo Chavez said
Wednesday he was ``completely sure'' Washington would reverse its
policy of banning him from the United States. Local stocks soared
after his election, he said, because ``we have demonstrated to the
world that we are not savages.''
	   The Caracas stock exchange opened sharply higher for the second
straight day Wednesday, continuing a rally caused by Chavez's
conciliatory statements after his landslide victory Sunday. The
market was up 11.4 percent Wednesday morning, following a record 22
percent hike the previous day.
	   Investors had long feared Chavez, who as an army officer in 1992
staged an unsuccessful coup attempt, would roll back free market
economic reforms and civil liberties. But his statements in the
last two days promising fiscal discipline and calling for national
reconciliation have calmed investor fears, for now.
	   Speaking to reporters Wednesday after meeting with President
Rafael Caldera, Chavez, 44, said the stock market rally reflected
Venezuelans peaceful vote for change.
	   ``There is a fresh breeze,'' he said. ``We have broken our
chains.''
	   He said he met earlier Wednesday with U.S. Ambassador John
Maisto, who he said delivered a letter of congratulations from
President Bill Clinton. Because of his coup attempt, Chavez was
placed on a U.S. list of alien undesirables barred from entering
the United States.
	   In recent days, U.S. officials have to moved to improve
relations with Chavez, whose country is the number one exporter of
oil to the United States.
	   ``I am completely sure that within a few weeks I will be in the
United States,'' Chavez said.
	   On Monday, State Department spokesman James Foley said that
heads of state normally receive a diplomatic visa to visit the
United States, adding, ``The U.S. government is prepared to take
the necessary steps to address any request for a visa that
President-elect Chavez may make.''
	   During his press conference Wednesday, Chavez reiterated his
plans to root out corruption, review the country's oil policies and
call a constituent assembly to rewrite the constitution.
	   ``The country voted for transformation and now there is no
turning back,'' he said.

South Africa includes mixed-race player following criticism

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Batsman Herschelle Gibbs will
make his eighth appearance for South Africa in the second test
against the West Indies starting Thursday, adding a mixed-race
player to a side that was criticized for being all white in its
series-opening victory.
	   The addition of Gibbs, who last appeared for South Africa in
February in a drawn test against Pakistan at Johannesburg, comes
after the South African side was denounced by the National Sports
Council as well as Sports Minister Steve Tshwete following its
four-wicket victory over the West Indies on Nov. 30.
	   The United Cricket Board of South Africa has pledged to enforce
quota systems at the provincial level from next year, and to
constitute an advisory committee to the national selection panel to
guide it if black or mixed-race players can't be found for the
national side.
	   Gibbs, who has a 17.15 average in his 13 test innings, was
schooled at Cape Town's Diocesan College, one of the most exclusive
schools in the country, and a place renowned for its cricketing
facilities.
	   He will replace Adam Bacher as Gary Kisten's opening partner.
The young Western Province player has never opened at this level,
and has never been given an extended run in the test side.
	   ``He'll obviously have a bit of nerves but I think batting with
his province teammate Kirsten will also help settle him down,''
South African captain Hansie Cronje said.
	   Bacher was bowled for a single run in his first innings and only
six in his second against the West Indies in Johannesburg.
	   South Africa also learned that reserve seamer David Terbrugge
has been declared fit and available for duty.
	   Terbrugge, who has been struggling with a slight side strain,
was given approval after two strenuous workouts at St George's
Park.
	   ``I'm satisfied that he is 100 percent,'' selector Peter Pollock
said. ``So that's all there is to it. He is in the squad.''
	   The West Indies will be looking for much more from its captain,
Brian Lara, who hit for only 11 and seven in his two innings.
	   Lara's side is under a little more pressure and either expects
to be tied or down two matches.
	   ``I think it's either going to be 1-1 or 2-0,'' he said. ``It
looks like a result wicket and both teams have got good fast
bowlers and vulnerable batting. I don't see it as 1-0 after two and
it's very important that we are the winners in this particular
test.
	   ``We wouldn't like to be two down with three to play. It's very
important for West Indies cricket. We have come to South Africa,
not to look at the place, but to win the series.''
	   Lara's concerns include Curtly Ambrose, nursing a minor elbow
injury, and Franklyn Rose, who is still limping.
	   ``Curtly is a worry,'' Lara said. ``He hasn't done much bowling
in the nets, but he's 35 going on 36. I'm sure he'll be OK.''
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Teams &QC; 
	   West Indies: Brian Lara, Clayton Lambert, Philo Wallace,
Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Carl Hooper, Stuart Williams, Ridley
Jacobs, Nixon McLean, Curtly Ambrose, Courtney Walsh, Mervyn
Dillon, Rawl Lewis.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin was released from a hospital today
after more than two weeks of treatment for pneumonia. He moved to a
secluded country residence outside the capital, the Kremlin said.
	   The 67-year-old Yeltsin has rarely been seen or heard since he
was admitted to the Central Clinical Hospital on Nov. 22. He
appeared in the Kremlin for three hours Monday to fire several top
aides and then returned to his hospital bed.
	   Yeltsin's spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, said the president moved
to the wooded Rus residence, 60 miles outside Moscow, for a
``convalescence period.''
	   ``Doctors are generally satisfied with the president's
condition,'' Yakushkin told the Interfax news agency, adding that
Yeltsin will continue to receive ``periodic checkups at the
hospital.''
	   Yeltsin did not have any meetings planned today and there was no
word on when he might return to the Kremlin.
	   Yeltsin insists he has no serious health problems, but after so
many illnesses in recent years, few believe he will be able to
maintain a normal working schedule. He has said almost nothing
about Russia's economic crisis, which hit four months ago.
	   However, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who is dealing with
the economic turmoil, said Yeltsin can ``perfectly perform'' his
duties and will ``work until the end of his term'' in 2000. His
remarks were published today in the Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper.
	   Primakov has handled many presidential duties in recent months,
and he gathered his top ministers today to work out next year's
budget.
	   The president's latest illness clearly demonstrated that Yeltsin
is not involved in the day-to-day running of the government,
although he remains extremely sensitive to any suggestions that he
is a lame duck, or that he won't serve out his term.
	   The president's only major announcement during his illness was
the dismissal of his aides, some of whom had dared to comment on
his health problems.
	   Russia remains in a deep recession, with the economy expected to
shrink about 5 percent this year and forecasts pointing toward a
similar contraction, if not worse, next year.
	   Russia in the 1990s has suffered one of the worst depressions
ever experienced by an industrial nation, and Yeltsin no longer
even pretends to offer solutions to the country's entrenched
problems.

Trial of American-born Palestinian begins

 &UR; EDs: UPDATES throughout with background on Hamas crackdown, fresh
comment from lawyers; RAISES U.S. protests and color from trial &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BEIT EL, West Bank (AP) _ An 18-year-old American-born
Palestinian charged with membership in an Islamic militant group
went on trial Wednesday in an Israeli military court.
	   Hashem Mufleh's lawyer argued that the crimes his client are
accused of would not hold in the United States where Mufleh would
be protected by the Fifth Amendment.
	   Israel and the Palestinian Authority, as part of the
U.S.-brokered peace accords have been cracking down on Hamas, the
group which opposes peace and has carried out deadly attacks
against Israel.
	   As part of such measures, Israel arrested Mufleh, who has lived
with his mother for 16 years in the Palestinian-run West Bank city
of Ramallah, in August as he tried to board a flight to the United
States to attend college in Gallup, New Mexico, where his father
lives.
	   A few days after Mufleh's arrest, the U.S. State Department
protested his detention, his interrogation and the conditions under
which he was being kept. His family said that because of the
intervention of U.S. officials in Israel, Mufleh's prison
conditions have improved.
	   ``It's ironic that Americans are getting Palestinians to crack
down on Hamas and they totally support these military orders and
military courts and then they find an American citizen who is being
arrested and held without bail, basically for practicing American
freedoms,'' Kuttab said.
	   At his trial in an Israeli military court in Beit El, West Bank,
he was accused of membership in Hamas, throwing a stone and other
objects at moving Israeli vehicles, distributing Hamas leaflets and
participating in a demonstration commemorating Hamas bomb-maker
Mohyedin Sharif, who was killed in an explosion earlier this year.
	   Wearing a Miami Dolphins T-shirt, glasses, and dark Nike
basketball shoes, Mufleh counted Muslim prayer beads as he listened
to the Arabic translation of the proceedings, which were conducted
in Hebrew.
	   ``I'm not involved with Hamas. I'm religious. I'm a Muslim,'' he
told The Associated Press.
	   Two Israeli policemen testified that Mufleh had confessed of his
own free will but Kuttab claimed the confession was ``extracted
under torture.''
	   Moshe Levy, a police officer who took down Mufleh's statement
after he was questioned by interrogators from Israel's Shin Bet
security agency, said Mufleh did not appear to have been
ill-treated. ``As far as I remember he looked fine. I don't
remember seeing any marks on him,'' Levy told the court.
	   His mother, Itaf Mufleh said ``He studied the Koran and prayer.
Does that mean he belongs to Hamas?''
	   Kuttab argued that the Mufleh's actions would have been legal in
the United States and would be protected under the Constitution.
	   Kuttab's request to release his client on bail was denied two
weeks ago by a military judge.
	   Last month several Arab American and human rights groups
launched a campaign to press for Mufleh's release.

Prosecutors release second human rights activist
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARIAM SAMI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Prosecutors took in a human rights activist
for questioning Wednesday on an accusation of accepting foreign
money to damage Egypt's reputation, but then freed him on bail.
	   Mustafa Zeidan was the second official of the Egyptian
Organization for Human Rights to be detained over the group's
report that police arrested hundreds of Coptic Christians and
tortured dozens during a murder investigation in southern Egypt.
	   The report caused a furor in Egypt after foreign organizations
and some Egyptian Copts living abroad used it to support their
allegation that the government discriminates against the Christian
minority.
	   The group's report had not alleged discrimination against
Christians in the southern town of al-Kosheh, but said instead the
police behavior was typical of practices used against Egyptians in
general.
	   Zeidan was questioned for a few hours before being freed on 200
Egypt pounds (dlrs 60) bail. The rights group's secretary-general,
Hafez Abu Saada, was jailed for six days and released on bail on
Sunday.
	   Officials at the prosecutors' office said that Zeidan, who
visited al-Kosheh to investigate the arrests, denied he wrote the
report and offered to show prosecutors written statements from town
residents complaining they were tortured.
	   The prosecutors' charges are based, in part, on a report by
Al-Osboa, an Egyptian weekly, alleging that the human rights group
accepted a nearly dlrs 25,000 donation from the British Parliament
as ``payment'' for their report.
	   The group admitted it accepted the money but said it was for a
women's legal aid program. It announced it would stop accepting
money from foreign governments.
	   The group issued a statement Wednesday vowing to fight what it
said was a campaign ``that aims at tarnishing the organization's
image and that of the rest of human rights groups.''
	   The charge of accepting foreign money to damage Egypt carries a
prison sentence of up to 15 years at hard labor. But it was not
clear prosecutors would bring the case to court.
	   The government has denied the torture allegations, but
transferred four policeman from the town, pending an investigation.
On Tuesday, Interior Minister Habib el-Adly accused human rights
groups _ without naming any _ of dispersing ``false and baseless''
reports.
	   Also Wednesday, a Cairo criminal court opened a trial on a 10
billion British pound (dlrs 16.5 billion) suit against the British
newspaper The Telegraph for publishing an article on al-Kosheh.
	   Mustafa Ashoub, a lawyer who represents 100 Copts, said the
report harmed Egypt's image abroad. If he won the case, the money
would be earmarked for rural development in Egypt's poor south, he
added.
	   The court postponed the case until Dec. 30 and asked Ashoub to
provide an Arabic translation of the article.

	   ``The comments he has made ... and his call to rebellion justify
that I remove him from the position of general delegate that I had
given him,'' Le Pen's statement said.
	   Le Pen, 70, has been the absolute leader of the extreme-right
party for a quarter-century. But his increasingly public struggle
with the quieter and more pragmatic _ though no less ideological _
Megret has weakened his hand.
	   Megret held a news conference Wednesday afternoon to demand the
urgent meeting of the party's 50,000 or so members nationwide _ a
demand that Le Pen, in his statement, termed an effort ``to
destabilize the movement.''
	   ``I will never leave the National Front, neither by resigning
nor by being pushed out,'' Megret told a packed news conference.
	   ``The situation in the National Front is very serious,'' Megret
said. ``It is time to return to peace and unity.''
	   Megret insisted that his move was not aimed against Le Pen
personally.
	   ``If he sees this as a putsch, that is completely incorrect,''
Megret said.
	   Asked whether the party congress would consider electing a new
president, Megret said only: ``I don't want to enter into those
considerations.''

Britain allows Spain to start extradition of Pinochet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Straw's reasons for decision, Margaret Thatcher
calling it a ``grave mistake, other reaction; TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Home Secretary Jack Straw ruled Wednesday that
Spain can start extradition proceedings against former Chilean
dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet to face charges of genocide, torture
and kidnapping.
	   In a statement, Straw said the 83-year-old general appeared fit
to stand trial and rejected complaints that a judge who ruled
against Pinochet was biased because he heads the fund-raising arm
of the human rights organization Amnesty International.
	   ``The Spanish request for his extradition will now be considered
by the courts,'' the statement said.
	   The decision means that Pinochet, under armed guard at a mansion
outside London, now faces months and possibly years of battles
through British courts fighting extradition.
	   His lawyers have said they may seek an urgent review before a
judge, arguing that Straw would be wrong on legal points to let
Spain have the general.
	   Human rights organizations were esctatic, while Pinochet's
right-wingers supporters expressed outrage at this latest blow.
	   Former Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher said
Britain's Labor Party government had made a ``grave mistake.''
	   ``He had ample power to put an end to this shameful and damaging
episode,'' she said of Straw. ``He has chosen, instead, to prolong
it ... This was a political decision and it represents a failure of
political leadership.''
	   Carlos Reyas, leader of a Chilean exile group, was almost
speechless with delight, describing Straw's decision as a
``wonderful omen.''
	   Straw had agonized over the decision since Britain's highest
court, the House of Lords, said in a 3-2 ruling Nov. 25 that
Pinochet has no immunity from arrest under English law. He made his
announcement two days before Friday's deadline.
	   Pinochet, a regular visitor to Britain, was arrested Oct. 16 on
a Spanish warrant.
	   A Chilean government report says 3,197 people were murdered or
disappeared at the hands of the secret police during his 17-year
rule. He overthrew an elected Marxist, Salvador Allende, in a 1973
coup.
	   ``We congratulate the Home Secretary on this difficult but
courageous decision which brings us one step closer to the day when
Pinochet will have to answer to his victims,'' said Reed Brody,
spokesman for the New York-based Human Rights Watch.
	   Amnesty International, which earlier Wednesday failed to get a
High Court injunction to stop Pinochet fleeing if Straw had ruled
in his favor, said it was ``absolutely delighted.''
	   But the decision dealt a new blow to Britain's already strained
relations with Chile, which has waged a diplomatic battle for the
general's release partly because of fears that renewed tensions
between his supporters and opponents will threaten the country's
new democracy.
	   Chilean President Eduardo Frei, who heard the news of a visit to
Brazil, made no immediate comment.
	   The decision opened the prospect of a long legal fight by an old
man living _ and possibly dying _ under arrest in a foreign
country.
	   Pinochet remained at a mansion at Wentworth, some 20 miles (30
kms) west of London. He was moved there Dec. 1 after the north
London hospital where he spent more than a month said he did not
need medical attention.
	   Three judges in the House of Lords ruled that some crimes are
heinous beyond immunity. The one who tipped the decision against
Pinochet, South African-born Lord Justice Leonard Hoffmann, is the
director of the fund-raising arm of Amnesty International.

Hill says Kosovo diplomacy `still on track' despite problems
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met with
ethnic Albanian negotiators Wednesday and said efforts to find a
political settlement to the Kosovo conflict are ``still on track.''
	   He was scheduled to meet later with a spokesman for Kosovo
Albanian rebels before heading to Belgrade for talks Thursday with
Serbian government officials and on to Paris to report to the
international Contact Group on the Balkans.
	   ``We believe that our negotiations are still on track,'' he
said, despite criticism on all sides of the latest U.S. proposal.
	   ``Ultimately the responsibility of reaching a settlement rests
with both sides,'' he said. ``They need to find ways to
compromise.''
	   He acknowledged that the ethnic Albanians had objected
vociferously to the latest plan, while Belgrade ``had a lot of
problems with the (earlier) November draft.''
	   Shuttle diplomacy will continue between the sides in efforts to
reach a settlement, he said.
	   ``I think there is a very strong view that we need to speed up
the process, we need to get this political process to the
endgame,'' Hill said.
	   Wolfgang Petritsch, the European Union envoy for Kosovo,
accompanied Hill in the talks and expressed optimism that
``something should be achieved in the next couple of weeks.''
	   ``This is a very decisive point in time,'' he said. ``We mustn't
lose the momentum.''

Ukrainian parliament sets up commission on Lazarenko
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's parliament set up a commission
Wednesday to look into the arrest in Switzerland of former
Ukrainian prime minister Pavlo Lazarenko on money laundering
charges.
	   The commission, approved by a vote of 243-8, will be headed by
deputy speaker Viktor Medvedchuk and will also look into the
conduct of Ukraine's Foreign Ministry and other government
institutions in the case.
	   The Verkhovna Rada urged its speaker Oleksandr Tkachenko to
express lawmakers' concern over the arrest to Swiss authorities and
the Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly, and ask that the
case be resolved as soon as possible.
	   Lazarenko, now a centrist opposition legislator, was detained
last week upon entering Switzerland, and was charged last Friday in
connection with a ``relatively large'' sum of money.
	   On Tuesday, Lazarenko appeared before a Swiss court to deny
allegations of money laundering, while his supporters continued to
stage demonstrations in Kiev demanding his release.
	   The Geneva court will decide next Friday on the prosecution's
demands that Lazarenko be detained for an additional three months.
The defense is urging his release on bail of up to 5 million Swiss
francs (dlrs 3.6 million), saying the charges were insufficient.
	   Lazarenko has admitted moving money to Swiss accounts but
claimed he could prove it was not of criminal origin.
	   His backers in Ukraine say he is the victim of a political smear
campaign, and accuse the Ukrainian authorities of doing nothing to
help him.
	   Ukraine's Foreign Ministry, however, dismissed such criticism
Wednesday, saying it ``had done everything possible at this
stage,'' including verifying the circumstances of the arrest and
helping two lawmakers from Lazarenko's party to travel to
Switzerland.
	   Lazarenko has refused to meet with Ukrainian consular officers
in Geneva since the arrest.
	   He also was carrying a Panama passport, said First Deputy
Foreign Minister Oleksandr Chalyi. Ukraine, which has no dual
citizenship, has asked Panama to clarify whether such a passport
had been issued to Lazarenko, Chalyi said, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   Lazarenko was prime minister from 1996-97, and was then
dismissed by President Leonid Kuchma. Critics say Lazarenko reaped
huge profits from the distribution of natural gas supplies in the
former Soviet republic when he served as prime minister, but he and
his allies deny the charges.
	   In a statement Tuesday, Lazarenko's Hromada party said the
arrest in Switzerland was an ``unprecedented act of reprisal aimed
at discrediting an opposition leader.''
	   Lazarenko and his followers maintain that Ukrainian authorities
want to blacken his name before presidential elections in October
1999, and he has even accused Kuchma's close entourage of plotting
to kill him.
	   Hromada fared well in parliamentary elections this year and
Lazarenko was widely considered a top contender in the future
presidential race.
	   A Geneva judge, Laurent Kasper-Ansermet, is in Ukraine for the
investigation.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In a new challenge to the U.N. search for
illegal weapons in Iraq, a team of inspectors was turned back
Wednesday when it tried to enter a major office of the ruling
party, a key site of Saddam Hussein's government.
	   Richard Butler, head of the U.N. Special Commission, which
oversees inspections, called the Iraqi action ``a blockage.''
	   ``This was an absolutely legal no-notice inspection and they
blocked us,'' he told The Associated Press in New York.
	   The inspectors withdrew after an Iraqi official demanded that
they first provide a written declaration ``on the material and
items'' they sought, the official Iraqi News Agency said.
	   The incident _ which has the potential to blow into another
crisis _ came two days after Butler announced that he was ordering
the resumption of the so-called surprise inspections. On Tuesday,
the inspectors visited 32 sites.
	   Butler said the Iraqi demand for a written notice is ``simply
wrong'' and ``nonsense.''
	   Iraq, which had suspended the inspections in August, allowed
them to resume only last month, averting a military strike by the
United States and Britain. The two countries have left an armada in
the Gulf to ensure Iraq abides by its promise to cooperate fully
with the inspectors.
	   UNSCOM must certify that Iraq has eliminated its chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons as well as long-range missiles
before U.N. economic sanctions can be lifted.
	   The sanctions were imposed after the 1990 Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait, and Iraqi officials have long insisted they have eliminated
all illegal weapons.
	   The United States reacted cautiously Wednesday to Iraq's action.
David Leavy, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said
the U.S. government was awaiting an assessment by Butler next week
of Iraq's overall compliance with U.N. requirements.
	   ``As the president has said, if UNSCOM cannot do its job
effectively, we remain poised to act,'' Leavy said. He declined to
say what would trigger U.S. military action.
	   Wednesday's disagreement was played out outside one of the four
branch headquarters of the Baath Party in Baghdad.
	   A U.N. inspection team tried to get into the building Wednesday
morning ``in a surprising and provocative manner,'' INA said,
quoting Gen. Hossam Mohammed Amin, who heads an office that liaises
with the inspectors.
	   He complained that the team was seeking a confrontation.
	   ``The practices of the inspectors .... have the clear goal of
creating crises and problems,'' Amin said.
	   Ewen Buchanan, the inspectors' spokesman in New York, said this
round of inspections, which were scheduled to end Monday, would
continue. He did not know whether inspectors would try to enter the
site again.
	   Caroline Cross, a U.N. spokeswoman in Baghdad, said earlier that
``a little less than 200'' inspectors were working in Iraq. When
asked if they would carry out surprise visits, she said only the
``inspectors will carry on a full range of activities.''
	   Unannounced visits in the past have been a major source of
friction with Iraq, leading to three crises in the past year.
	   Iraqi newspapers carried further accounts Wednesday of comments
by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz in Moscow in which he said
there is a limit to Iraq's cooperation with the United Nations in
the search for weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``This situation is no longer acceptable,'' Aziz said, referring
to the U.N. sanctions that have blocked free export of Iraq's oil.
	   Meanwhile, in a letter released Wednesday, Iraqi Foreign
Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf appealed for help from Arab
countries, which he said had largely deserted Iraq.
	   ``Iraqis in their neighborhoods, cities and villages wonder
where are their brother Arabs and where is the Arab League and its
secretary general with what is happening to their brothers in
Iraq,'' al-Sahhaf in a letter to the Cairo-based league.
	   In November, several key Arab countries declared that Iraq would
be held responsible for any conflict.

Chechen leader says hostages killed while rescue was in works

	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechen police were searching Wednesday
for the bodies of four kidnapped foreigners who were beheaded
during a botched attempt to free them.
	   The deaths _ and the ostentatious display of the heads by
killers _ prompted neighboring Russian regions to close off roads
into Chechnya, and caused an outpouring of outrage and lament from
Russian and foreign officials.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said Wednesday that one
alleged kidnapper had been arrested and authorities gleaned enough
information to launch a rescue operation for the hostages, three
Britons and a New Zealander.
	   But during the rescue attempt the kidnappers panicked and
decapitated the captives, Maskhadov said, according to Russian
media reports.
	   ``A concrete criminal group was identified, an organizer of the
abductions was arrested and an approximate location of the hostages
was determined,'' Maskhadov said in a statement.
	   ``The criminals brutally executed the hostages while an
operation for their release was under way,'' he said.
	   The severed heads of the four men were found lined up along a
highway Tuesday outside Chechnya's capital Grozny, and hundreds of
Chechen law enforcement officers were searching for the bodies
Wednesday.
	   ``We will take all necessary steps to solve this horrible
crime,'' said Maskhadov, who has been unable to restore law and
order in Chechnya since being elected last year.
	   The victims _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf
Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were identified by their
former bodyguard. They had been abducted by unidentified gunmen
Oct. 3 in Grozny.
	   The men were employees of Britain's Granger Telecom, and were
working with Chechnya's communications firm, Chechen Telecom, to
set up a mobile phone network in Chechnya, which was devastated
during the 1994-96 war for independence from Russia.
	   The Chechen Telecom office was attacked before dawn Wednesday by
assailants using grenade launchers. One guard was wounded, security
officials said. Several Chechen Telecom employees have been
kidnapped in recent days.
	   It was not clear if there was any link between Wednesday's
attack and the deaths of the hostages.
	   However, there have been reports that rival groups in Chechnya
were seeking money from the contract to rebuild the country's phone
system.
	   Meanwhile, three Russian republics bordering Chechnya blocked
off all roads leading to and from the secessionist territory.
	   ``The Chechen republic has been sealed off from all sides,''
Magomet Khatuyev, the head of Chechnya's border service, told
Interfax.
	   Since the war ended, Chechnya has been running its own affairs.
But it has been plagued by criminal gangs and there are frequent
kidnappings for ransom. Most hostages have been released unharmed,
though dozens remain in captivity.
	   ``The Russian government throughout has sought to be as helpful
as it can within its power, but that power is very limited in
Chechnya,'' said British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who met his
Russian counterpart Igor Ivanov on Wednesday in Belgium.
	   British Foreign Office Minister Tony Lloyd told the House of
Commons Wednesday that the situation in Chechnya is ``unstable and
confused'' and said it wouldn't be wise to risk further lives by
sending British officials into the region to investigate.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair described the murder as ``tragic and
horrifying.''
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin expressed outrage at the
killings and urged law enforcement officials to crack down on
kidnappings.
	   Russia's Foreign Ministry on Wednesday reiterated its
recommendation that foreigners not visit Chechnya, Interfax said.

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ ``Clinton visits Palestine,'' read
the posters cluttering the Al Wan print shop.
	   Even if the U.S. president doesn't understand the Arabic caption
beneath his smiling face, the picture will be clear when he arrives
next week: Palestinians are getting ready for a state visit to an
entity Bill Clinton is not quite ready to call a state.
	   When he lands at Gaza International Airport on Monday, a
khaki-clad honor guard will blast ``The Star Spangled Banner'' on
bagpipes _ and then launch in to ``Biladi, Biladi'' (My Homeland,
My Homeland), a fiercely nationalist anthem that Israel banned
during its occupation of Gaza.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has made it clear that he sees
Clinton's visit as nothing less than a state visit, and there are
signs that the Clinton administration is edging closer to
recognizing Palestinian aspirations to statehood.
	   In May, Hillary Rodham Clinton expressed support for statehood,
speaking to a youth gathering in Geneva. Aides quickly said she was
speaking her own mind _ but the statement was seen as her husband's
trial balloon.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government is loathe to
confer any recognition of statehood on Arafat, arguing that this
would re-empt the outcome of future talks on the final status of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   Clinton has deferred to some Israeli concerns _ a helicopter
will land at Gaza airport instead of Air Force One, as originally
planned _ but both the Israelis and Palestinians agree that the
visit amounts to recognition.
	   Clinton will also visit Israel, but with the U.S.-brokered Wye
River peace accord collapsing under a wave of violence and mutual
recriminations two months after it was signed in Maryland, the
first-ever visit by a sitting president to Gaza stings in Israel.
	   The Yediot Ahronot newspaper reported that nine out of 17
ministers were now against the Clinton visit.
	   ``It's not the right time,'' Education Minister Yitzhak Levy
told Yediot. ``No doubt, the Palestinians will use his arrival for
international advances beyond the commitments'' of Wye.
	   The trappings of Clinton's visit are overwhelming its original
purpose, his presence at a convening of the Palestine National
Council that will delete passages from the PLO founding charter
calling for Israel's destruction.
	   The airport honor guard will be made up of members of Arafat's
elite bodyguard ``Force 17.''
	   If Clinton proceeds through Gaza city in a motorcade _
Palestinian security won't confirm that until Monday _ he will gaze
out at spotless streets, scrubbed clean for his visit.
	   He will pass marching high-school girls clad in blue uniforms,
high-school boys dressed in brown. Toddlers will line sidewalks,
armed with freshly-printed Palestinian and U.S. flags.
	   Clinton's presence had only one meaning for Al-Wan print shop
owner George Tarazi, commissioned by Arafat's office to print
10,000 posters.
	   ``This visit means for us, the Palestinians, that the United
States now is putting us again on the map of the world as an
independent state,'' he said Wednesday.
	   The Gaza municipal spokesman described the visit as
``historic.''
	   ``We asked the owner of the shops to paint their walls and we
are going to send our teams to clean the streets and to plant trees
in the Gaza Streets,'' Hamdi Abu-Kahresh said.
	   For one Gaza perfume merchant, U.S. recognition of statehood _
implicit or not _ had practical implications.
	   ``This visit will open a new page,'' he said, ``when American
businessmen can come here and invest in Palestine.''

Museveni promises donors to fight corruption, defends military

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Appealing for foreign assistance,
Uganda's president Wednesday promised to fight high level
corruption, but defended increased military expenditure, saying
instability in neighboring countries made it necessary.
	   ``One impediment to more rapid economic development is
corruption by state officials,'' Yoweri Museveni said at the
opening of a conference of more than 20 countries on financial aid
to Uganda.
	   Foreign donors have pledged dlrs 1,190 million over the next
three years for social and economic programs in Uganda, while
Uganda says it needs dlrs 2,176 million. The donors expect to
decide by the end of the conference Friday whether to cover the
dlrs 986 million balance.
	   Donors earlier this week said they were concerned that public
funds targeting poverty were disappearing into private hands and
warned that without better accountability foreign funding to Uganda
would not be forthcoming.
	   It also criticized Uganda for increasing its military budget to
dlrs 164 million this year, up dlrs 30 million from the previous
year.
	   ``The worries within the donor community about the financial
implications of military interventions abroad might affect
budgeting for poverty eradication,'' said Netherlands Embassy
official Saskia de Lang, representing donor countries at a meeting
in Kampala on Monday.
	   Uganda, along with neighboring Rwanda, has been openly sending
troops and equipment to Congolese rebels fighting since Aug. 2 to
oust Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
	   Both countries argue that Kabila has allowed Rwandan and Ugandan
rebels to operate freely in eastern Congo and launch cross-border
attacks into their countries of origin.
	   Uganda is also combating Ugandan rebels operating out of
war-torn southern Sudan.
	   Museveni said instability in the region made it vital that
Uganda modernize its military. He noted the army had complied with
World Bank and International Monetary Fund demands to scale down.
	   ``Until 1993, we had an army of 100,000 officers and men,''
Museveni said. ``We reduced this to 40,000 on the clear
understanding that the smaller force will have to be better
equipped. We have not achieved the required level of equipping ...
accelarated by the present crises in the region: Congo and Sudan.''
	   He said the Great Lakes region lacked a regional force to
maintain peace and safeguard security for countries bordering war
zones.
	   Museveni, whose country's annual budget is 50 percent funded by
other countries and multilateral institutions, acknowledged high
level corruption was a difficult problem. He said he wanted to set
up mechanisms of government plants inside the judiciary the revenue
machinery, the land office, the immigration department, police and
medical services to weed out graft.
	   ``The army was easier to reform than all the other organs of
state: judiciary, civil service and police,'' he said. ``This is
because it takes much longer to train a judge than to train an army
officer.''
	   ``I might be forced to import cadres from abroad,'' Museveni
added. ``We might even import judges from abroad and what is wrong
with that if they are doing a good job. They might not be
corrupt.''

	   The feud between Le Pen and Megret, long thought to be Le Pen's
heir apparent, has been obvious for months. But it burst into the
open over the weekend, at a noisy party meeting where Le Pen
ejected several Megret supporters he had fired a few days earlier.
	   On Monday, a Le Pen loyalist, Serge Martinez, spoke out against
his boss, and he was immediately fired _ along with three others
the same day.
	   Le Pen and Megret share similar ideas; their party, which has
been widely accused of racism and anti-Semitism, is opposed to
immigration and to European integration. But they have disagreed
over how to implement their ideas.
	   Since the events of the past week, speculation has mounted that
the National Front would finally split over the bitter struggle.
Some thought Megret might announce his departure on Wednesday.
	   But Megret was betting on the support of the majority of party
members. He said Wednesday that party organizations in 11 out of 22
regions supported his call for a congress.
	   Le Pen's daughter warned Megret in a newspaper interview
published Wednesday to back her father or leave the party.
	   ``Bruno Megret must disown the rebels and rejoin our cause or
face the consequences,'' Marine Le Pen told the daily Le Parisien.
	   A member of the party's central committee, Ms. Le Pen suggested
that Megret start his own party if he refuses to back down.

Arafat on prisoners: Let Palestinian `heroes' go

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with death of Palestinian, more injuries, 18th graf
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC;

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Prisoners Israel regards as murderers
are ``heroes,'' Yasser Arafat told cheering crowds Wednesday, four
days before U.S. President Bill Clinton arrives in the region to
prop up the teetering peace accord he helped broker.
	   Palestinians rioted throughout the West Bank on Wednesday, the
fourth day of violence sparked by Israel's refusal to release
prisoners detained on terrorist charges.
	   ``We tell our heroes in the prisons we will not close our eyes
until we see them in front of our eyes,'' Arafat told about 1,000
people attending a conference of his Fatah faction.
	   The crowd cheered, ``If you want fighters, we will be your
fighters.''
	   Netanyahu has repeatedly denied that he agreed to release
Palestinians convicted of attacks on Israelis. He has sworn not to
release ``murderers.''
	   ``Why would anyone who declares that he wants peace would want
to release these type of people?'' Israeli government spokesman
Moshe Fogel said, in reaction to Arafat's remarks.
	   Arafat told the crowd that during the Wye River negotiations in
October, Clinton even named some of the security prisoners to be
released.
	   The Clinton Administration was scrambling to salvage the Wye
agreement before the president's arrival on Saturday. U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright demanded that Israel and the
Palestinians stick to its terms.
	   Her appeals _ and a firefighting visit to the region by top U.S.
Mideast envoy Dennis Ross _ appeared to go unheeded. Netanyahu
continued to insist that a troop withdrawal scheduled for next week
would be delayed.
	   Arafat told his followers that he had defied a plea by Ross to
avoid angering Israelis by not referring in public to a possible
unilateral declaration of statehood.
	   ``They told me not to use or say the word state,'' he said. ``I
told we have said it already and that is it.''
	   In a dig at Israeli apprehensions about the Clinton visit,
Arafat said he believed he had Clinton's implicit backing for
statehood in any case.
	   ``There are six ministers in the Israeli government who do not
welcome his coming,'' Arafat said of Clinton. ``He insists on
coming because he recognizes this people and home land.''
	   ``We welcome the president's visit unequivocally,'' Fogel
countered.
	   Arafat pressed another button by pledging that Jerusalem _ which
Israel says will remain entirely under its sovereignty _ will one
day be Palestine's capital.
	   ``Jerusalem is the capital of the Palestinian state,'' Arafat
said.
	   On Wednesday _ the 11th anniversary of their uprising against
Israel _ hundreds of Palestinians stoned Israeli troops and
motorists throughout the West Bank.
	   Soldiers responded with rubber bullets, tear gas and live
bullets, killing a 17 year old Palestinian boy who was struck in
the chest with a live bullet. At least 67 Palestinians and six
Israelis were hurt.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Despite U.S. appeals to stop
violence, Palestinians stoned Israeli troops and motorists
Wednesday in the most widespread West Bank clashes in months, and a
Palestinian teen-ager was killed by Israeli army gunfire.
	   Helmeted soldiers in riot gear also fired rubber-coated steel
pellets and tear gas. In all, at least 67 Palestinians were hurt by
rubber bullets and three by live rounds. Three Israeli civilians
and two Israeli troops were lightly hurt by stones.
	   The death of Jihad Iyad, 17, who had been shot in the chest with
a live bullet, came just four days before the start of U.S.
President Bill Clinton's visit to Israel and the Palestinian areas
and was likely to trigger new violence.
	   A 21-year-old Palestinian university student, Nasr Erekat, who
was critically wounded by Israeli fire on Monday, died Wednesday
after being disconnected from life support. Erekat, a cousin of
chief Palestinian peace negotiator Saeb Erekat, was to be buried
Thursday.
	   Clashes erupted Wednesday on the outskirts of most West Bank
towns, with rioters pressing for the release of Palestinian
prisoners held by Israel and marking the 11th anniversary of their
uprising against Israeli occupation.

	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ An armed band massacred 45 people in an
overnight attack on a mountain town west of Algiers, security
forces announced Wednesday. It was the bloodiest attack in recent
months, and the latest in a new spiral of violence.
	   In a separate development, security forces digging up a well
used as a mass grave said Wednesday they have now pulled 45 bodies
out. The work to clear out the 55-meter (180-foot) deep well was
far from over, they said.
	   A statement by security forces provided no details about
Wednesday's pre-dawn massacre in Tadjena, near Chlef, about 200 kms
(125 miles) west of the capital.
	   The statement said only that the massacre was committed by a
``terrorist band,'' language signifying Muslim insurgents blamed
for numerous such massacres in recent years.
	   More than 75,000 people have died in seven years of violence in
this North African nation.

DaimlerChrysler plans new car plant in north Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Newly merged DaimlerChrysler said
Wednesday it plans to open a new manufacturing plant for small
transport vehicles in the north German town of Ludwigsfelde.
	   At least 1,250 jobs would be created, the company said.
	   The plant would be a welcome economic boost for Brandenburg, a
former east German state. Unemployment in the former communist
eastern states _ at 15.9 percent _ is nearly twice that in the west
and far above the national rate of 10.1 percent
	   The Brandenburg state government granted DaimlerChrysler a
subsidy of dlrs 136 million to build the plant. The European
Union's executive commission approved the grant at the beginning of
this month.
	   Daimler-Chrysler plans to invest dlrs 391 million in the new
plant and aims to sell 40,000-50,000 vehicles a year, starting in
2001.

	   Interior Minister Mustafa Benmansour visited the massacre site,
according to the statement.
	   The massacre raised the death toll since the start of the month
to at least 115 people.
	   The Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which starts Dec. 20 this
year, has brings an increase in violence. The trend appeared to
confirm itself this year, with the approach of Ramadan.
	   South of the capital, in an area now referred to as the
``Triangle of Death,'' security forces said Wednesday they have now
dug 45 bodies from a well at the Hafiz farm in Meftah.
	   It is not known how many more people may have been thrown into
the well, which clearly served as a mass grave.
	   Officials said that two days ago a bomb was vound inside the
well and there are now fears some bones could be booby-trapped.
	   Security forces are, therefore, working ``centimeter by
centimeter'' to reach the bottom of the well, which no longer
contains water.
	   Specialists date the mass grave from 1996 or 1997.
	   The insurgency erupted after the government canceled January
1992 elections the now banned Islamic Salvation Front was expected
to win.

Swiss concession over wine with famous name eases Europe accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with Swiss saying agreement reached, concession on
wine name. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland gave way Wednesday over the
famous name of a still wine from a small lakeside village, easing
the country closer to agreement in tough negotiations with the
European Union.
	   At issue was French displeasure over Swiss winemakers' use of
the prestigious Champagne name for their unbubbly white, which
sells around 50,000 bottles each year.
	   But the Swiss vintners protested that they are only following
the Swiss practice of naming their wine after their village, which
has been called Champagne, with variations on the spelling, since
the earliest documents in 885 A.D.
	   Swiss Champagners, who tend their vines above Lake Neuchatel in
Western Switzerland, have been making wine since the 10th century.
The French region began producing its famous sparkling wine at the
end of the 17th century.
	   After an overnight session with EU representatives in Brussels
became snagged on the Champagne issue, the Swiss agreed the name
must disappear from the labels of the Swiss wine, following a
transitional period of two years.
	   Last week, the EU and Switzerland struck a deal on transport,
concluding four years of tough negotiations.
	   The agreement cleared the way for the wider agreement covering
areas like air transport and labor.
	   The French say the Champagne name can only be used for the
famous sparkling white wine made in the Champagne region of France,
and held out against the bilateral trade agreements with
Switzerland.
	   Senior Swiss foreign ministry official Jakob Kellenberger told
reporters in Bern ``wide-ranging agreement'' had been reached,
subject to the approval by Thursday of the EU's 15 members.
	   Some technical issues have yet to be resolved, he added. The
agreement faces a long ratification process.
	   ``We can see the end of the tunnel but the European locomotive
hasn't yet arrived,'' Swiss government spokesman Achille Casanova
said.
	   The Swiss electorate voted six years ago against joining a loose
European free trade grouping.
	   Fearing another snub at the ballot box, the government has
frozen an application to join the more closely knit 15-nation EU
trade bloc, which now surrounds the country, and has concentrated
on the bilateral deals.
	   The villagers of Champagne themselves were resigned to losing
their right to use the name.
	   ``If the Swiss confederation gives in, it will have to look at
financial compensation,'' vineyard manager Albert Banderet was
quoted as saying in the daily Le Matin newspaper.

Le Pen dismisses Megret from party position
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Combines urgent series, minor editing. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOCELYN NOVECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen dismissed
his longtime lieutenant, Bruno Megret, from his position in the
extreme-right party Wednesday, only hours after Megret defied him
by calling for an emergency congress to solve their differences.
	   It was the latest rapid-fire development in the ugly feud
between Le Pen and his heir apparent that burst onto the surface
over the weekend.
	   In a statement, Le Pen said he had named Carl Lang, the party's
vice president, as general delegate in place of Megret.
	   ``The comments he has made ... and his call to rebellion justify
that I remove him from the position of general delegate,'' Le Pen's
statement said.
	   Le Pen, 70, has been the absolute leader of the far-right party
for a quarter-century. But his increasingly public struggle with
the quieter and more pragmatic _ though no less ideological _
Megret has weakened his hand.
	   Two hours before Le Pen's move, Megret had held a news
conference to demand the urgent meeting of the party's 50,000 or so
members nationwide _ a demand that Le Pen, in his statement, termed
an effort ``to destabilize the movement.''
	   ``I will never leave the National Front, neither by resigning
nor by being pushed out,'' Megret told the packed news conference.
	   ``The situation in the National Front is very serious,'' Megret
said. ``It is time to return to peace and unity.''
	   Megret insisted that his move was not aimed against Le Pen
personally.
	   ``If he sees this as a putsch, that is completely incorrect,''
Megret said.
	   But asked whether the party congress would consider electing a
new president, Megret said only: ``I don't want to enter into those
considerations.''
	   The feud between Le Pen and Megret has been obvious for months.
But it burst into the open over the weekend, at a noisy party
meeting where Le Pen ejected several Megret supporters he had fired
a few days earlier.
	   On Monday, a Le Pen loyalist, Serge Martinez, director of
personnel at the party, spoke out against his boss, and was
immediately fired _ along with three others the same day.
	   Le Pen and Megret share similar ideas; their party, which has
been widely accused of racism and anti-Semitism, is virulently
opposed to immigration and to European integration. But the men
have disagreed over how to implement their ideas.
	   With the events of the past week, speculation mounted that the
National Front would finally split over the bitter struggle. Some
thought Megret might announce his departure on Wednesday.
	   But Megret was betting on the support of the majority of party
members. He said Wednesday that party organizations in 11 out of 22
regions supported his call for a congress.

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistani cricketer Salim Malik on
Wednesday promised to sue accusers Shane Warne and Mark Waugh for
defamation following revelations his Australian counterparts were
fined for accepting money from Indian bookmakers.
	   Warne and Waugh, who have accused Malik of match fixing, were
secretly fined for accepting money in 1994 from Indian bookmakers
to supply information on the pitch and weather conditions in
Pakistan during a tour against Sri Lanka and Pakistan, the
Australian Cricket Board said Tuesday.
	   ``I am definitely going to take a legal action against Shane
Warne and Mark Waugh,'' Malik told The Associated Press in the
eastern city of Lahore, where he is preparing for Pakistan's second
test against Zimbabwe on Thursday.
	   ``I have suffered so much because of these false charges by
these Australian cricketers,'' said Malik. ``They have really upset
me and have spoiled my cricket for the last two years.''
	   In early 1995 the Australian pair were fined a total of dlrs
11,500 (Australian dollars 18,000) for accepting money from an
illegal Indian bookmaker in exchange for weather and pitch reports.
	   ``I am so happy that I really don't have words to express it,''
Malik saiod.
	   A judicial inquiry is underway in Pakistan probing match-fixing
charges against former captain Wasim Akram as well as Malik. Both
men have denied the charges.
	   Akram wasn't immediately available for comment on the charges
against Warne and Waugh.
	   Australia's Tim May, Waugh and Warne, have submitted affidavits
and Australian captain Mark Taylor and Waugh have given testimony
in the inquiry.
	   May, Waugh and Warne have said Malik offered them thousands of
dollars to throw a match in 1994 which they turned down.
	   ``They were taking money from the bookmakers . . . I am innocent
and they are the liars,'' Malik said. ``I will definitely sue them
in court.''
	   Justice Malik Mohammad Qayyum, judicial inquiry chief, said the
revelation that some Australian cricketers accepted bribes from
Indian bookmakers does not exonerate Malik.
	   But he said a new dimension has been added to the case following
the admissions by Warne and Waugh, he told reporters.
	   ``Authenticity of Australian allegations against Malik were
suspected. . . Legally they have weakened their case,'' he said.
	   Qayyum, whose report will be ready in two weeks, said he will
give the case further review.
	   ``I will definitely recommend a strong law against match fixing
and betting,'' he said.

Court reduces fine imposed on Ukraine's Communist leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A Kiev city court on Wednesday reduced the
fine imposed on Ukraine's Communist Party leader and a daily paper
for slandering a political scientist.
	   In October, a district court in Kiev ordered Petro Symonenko to
pay 20,000 hryvna (dlrs 5,800 at the time) in damages to Mykola
Tomenko, and ordered the Segodnya newspaper to come up with 10,000
hryvna (dlrs 2,900).
	   The sums were decreased following an appeal to 5,000 hryvna
(dlrs 1,460 at the current rate) for Symonenko and 2,500 hryvna
(dlrs 730) for the newspaper, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The scandal began last April when Symonenko, the Communist
leader, told Segodnya that Tomenko's independent Institute of
Politics had falsely claimed there were businessmen on the
Communist Party list in this year's parliamentary ballot.
	   Tomenko then sued Symonenko, saying the statements harmed him
and his professional reputation, seeking 100,000 hryvna (dlrs
24,240 at the time) in compensation from Symonenko and Segodnya.
	   The district court ruled that Symonenko's allegations harmed the
dignity and honor of Tomenko as a political scientist and a public
figure.
	   ``We're not satisfied by the court's decision to lower the sum
of the fine ... but will insist on it being implemented honestly,''
Tomenko told Interfax on Wednesday.
	   Tomenko said he might seek ``other ways of compensation'' from
Segodnya but was stricter about Symonenko. If the Communist leader
has no cash to pay the fine, he can sell his car, garage and some
land he owns, Tomenko said.

Gulf leaders agree to extend oil cuts until end of 1999
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES with fresh quotes by GCC secretary-general &QL; 
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Gulf Arab states on
Wednesday decided to extend until the end of 1999 an earlier cut in
oil production in a bid to hold up falling world prices that have
squeezed their petrodollar economies.
	   Ending a three-day summit, leaders of the six-nation Gulf
Cooperation Council also urged other oil producers to undertake
similar cuts ``to achieve market stability for the benefit of
producers and consumers.''
	   GCC Secretary-General Jamil al-Hojeilan told reporters that
production cut ``was one of the most important issues discussed by
the heads of state.''
	   A statement issued at the end of the summit said the GCC leaders
``agreed to extend their pledged cuts until the end of 1999.''
	   The statement refers to the pledges made in June by members of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and producers
outside the cartel to withdraw 3.1 million barrels a day from the
market for one year until June 1999. OPEC's share of that was 2.6
million barrels per day.
	   Four GCC's constituents _ Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar,
Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates _ are members of OPEC and
together control half the world's proven reserves of oil.
	   The non-OPEC members of GCC are Oman and Bahrain.
	   This year's summit was overshadowed by record-low oil prices
because of depressed demand in recession-hit Asia and a warm winter
in the West. The GCC states depend on oil exports for 75 percent of
their revenue.
	   Two weeks ago, OPEC ministers meeting at a year-end conference
failed to agree on measures to halt the slide in oil prices, but
decided to review the situation in March.
	   Al-Hojeilan refused to say whether the GCC would consider more
production cuts at the OPEC meeting, or during a proposed GCC
meeting of either ministers or heads of state.
	   A Gulf official said the leaders did not agree to deeper cuts
immediately because they were not convinced it would shore up the
market.
	   However, the decision could be reviewed at the OPEC meeting in
March if prices continue to slide, said the official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   On Tuesday, Hojeilan blamed overproduction by oil-rich nations
for the price slump.
	   He told the Middle East Broadcasting Corp., an Arabic TV
network, that ``the whole problem'' was caused by countries not
sticking to their production quotas.
	   Analysts say Venezuela, Iran, Indonesia and Qatar are the main
over-producers.
	   Shortly before the GCC meeting began, January futures contracts
for Brent crude _ a widely watched benchmark _ fell to a record low
of dlrs 9.92 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange in
London.
	   Gulf oil generally sells at a dollar or two less than the North
Sea's Brent _ which itself was selling for around dlrs 20 a barrel
as recently as 1997.
	   At the start of the summit Monday, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince
Abdullah warned that the oil boom days were over and that Gulf
states should face the new reality and tighten their belts.
	   The leaders at the summit also decided to draw up a customs
union by 1999 and implement it in the year 2001. The idea has been
discussed for 15 years.
	   The union, the first step to a common market, is a prerequisite
for free trade deals with other trading blocs such as the GCC's
main trading partner, the European Union.
	   The summit-end statement called on Iraq to unconditionally
respect all U.N. resolutions.
	   Referring to U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait, the communique blamed Iraq for the continuing U.N.
sanctions.
	   ``Iraq must admit that the invasion of Kuwait was illegal and
must prove its peaceful intentions towards Kuwait and other
regional nations,'' the communique said.
	   The resolution also urged Iran to work for a peaceful settlement
of a territorial dispute with the Emirates. Both states claim Abu
Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs, three tiny islands that Iran
annexed in 1992.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with decision allowing gymnasts to
continue &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ North Korea's female gymnasts were
cleared to continue at the Asian Games Wednesday when their
passports showed they were old enough to compete, Asia's top
Olympic official said.
	   The gymnasts were ordered to present their passports to verify
if they were 16 years or older after coaches from rival teams, as
well as doctors and officials, questioned the girls' ages.
	   Sheikh Ahmad Al-Sabah, president of the Olympic Council of Asia,
told The Associated Press: ``The passports say they are 16 years
old. That's all we can do.''
	   The North Korean team was given a deadline of midnight local
time (1700GMT) to present their passports. Al-Sabah announced the
clearance as the deadline passed.
	   Earlier a North Korean coach, Kim Song Sil, denied that any of
her charges were underage. ``All 16,'' she said.
	   Organizers called for the passport inspection after an official
from the Asian Gymnastics Union queried the age of their female
gymnasts.
	   ``She said I think we better check because their faces look very
young. They don't look 16,'' said Suebsai Boonveerabut, the
competition organizer.
	   But a meeting with the North Koreans shortly after the men's
all-around competition Wednesday proved inconclusive because the
passports were with another North Korean official who had gone to
the airport to meet someone, she said.
	   North Korea had three women competing in Wednesday's contest to
decide the best all-around gymnast. The top woman, Son Un-Hui,
finished 10th. The two youngest-looking members of the team, So
Jong Ok and Hwang Kum Hui, did not compete in the all-around
contest.
	   Earlier Jackie Fie, from the sport's governing body FIG, said
the matter would be over if the passports showed they were 16.
``You can't wage war with a government,'' Fie said.
	   Last year, the U.S. team had to leave three top gymnasts behind,
including national co-champion Vanessa Atler, for the world
championships because they were too young under the age 16 rule.
Partly as a result, the team finished sixth.

Greek naval chief visits Egypt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece's naval chief flew to Egypt
Wednesday for a five-day visit aimed at bolstering military ties
between the two countries.
	   Vice Admiral Giorgos Ioannidis' trip comes shortly after the two
countries held a week-long joint naval exercise earlier this month
as part of a defense pact, signed between the two countries when
Defense Minister Akis Tsochadzopoulos visited Cairo earlier year.
	   Greece and Egypt have expressed concern over expanding military
cooperation between Israel and Turkey, Athens' traditional rival.
	   In an apparent effort to alleviate Greek concerns, Israeli
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai will pay an official visit to
Greece this weekend.
	   Greek air force commander, Lt. Gen. Giorgos Antonetzis, visited
Israel last week.

IOC member families benefited from Salt Lake bid committee fund
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CARTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ Salt Lake Olympics officials disclosed
that six relatives of International Olympic Committee members
received scholarships before the city gained the 2002 Winter Games.
	   Salt Lake Organizing Committee officials insisted the bid
committee's privately financed dlrs 500,000 fund was for
humanitarian assistance _ not to secure votes of IOC members.
	   ``This was such a minute part of that effort, that to stretch it
to a campaign of vote influencing rather than a campaign to work in
the spirit of the Olympic movement, I don't think is justified,''
SLOC president Frank Joklik said Tuesday.
	   However, a bid official from Ostersund, Sweden, which lost the
2002 Winter Games to Salt Lake City, said last week that such
contributions gave the bidders who made them an unfair advantage.
	   ``We would consider it as a bribe,'' said Christer Persson, head
of Ostersund's three bids. ``We have understood now that we cannot
win competitions against countries that have other cultures than we
have in this respect because we can never do things like that.''
	   SLOC officials provided general details of the fund, which
operated between 1991 _ the year Salt Lake lost the bid for the
1998 Winter Games to Nagano, Japan _ and 1995, when it was awarded
the 2002 bid. Joklik said 13 individuals were given scholarships or
athletic training.
	   Six of them were ``direct relatives'' of IOC members, mostly
from Africa.
	   Joklik refused to identify the recipients or the IOC members
beyond Sonia Essomba, the daughter of the late Rene Essomba of
Cameroon. The controversy over the scholarships began when Salt
Lake television station KTVX disclosed that Sonia Essomba had been
a recipient.
	   She was given money to attend American University in Washington,
D.C.
	   From 1989 on, Rene Essomba, 66, was the secretary general of the
National Olympic Committees of Africa, a position that would have
given him considerable influence over the roughly 20 other IOC
members on that continent.
	   Regarding his refusal to identify the other recipients, Joklik
said, ``We thought it through and decided we won't want these young
people scrutinized. Nothing fruitful would be served at this stage
by exposing them to publicity.''
	   Joklik insisted the fund was set up to aid athletes and give a
leg-up to future leaders in poor countries.
	   ``Anyone who has had experience with the disparity in the living
conditions and the potential for human development in Africa versus
this country would find it difficult to argue affording educational
opportunities to children from those countries,'' he said.
	   He declined to characterize the coincidence that six of those
future leaders also happened to be relatives of IOC members.
	   And he acknowledged that it is likely the IOC relatives who
received money likely were from privileged and influential families
that would be in a better position than most in Africa.
	   Rene Essomba, for example, was a professor of surgery and former
chief of surgery at the University of Uaounde and had studied and
practiced medicine in France. He was a district governor and past
president of the Order of Doctors of Cameroon.
	   Of the seven who were not IOC relatives, only three were
athletes _ two members of the Sudanese athletics team and their
coach were brought to the United States to train at the U.S.
Olympic facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

Fired Westminster Abbey organist loses appeal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Westminster Abbey organist whose controversial
dismissal in April caused a backlash against the church's new dean,
lost his appeal Wednesday.
	   Music Director Martin Neary, who was decorated by Queen
Elizabeth II for his music program for the funeral of Princess
Diana last year, had appealed to the queen after being dismissed
amid allegations of financial impropriety leveled by the abbey
dean, the Right Rev. Wesley Carr.
	   Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle, a retired judge who heard the case
on behalf of the queen, ruled that Carr was justified in firing
Neary, and said the organist had undermined the relationship of
trust between him and the church in his handling of money received
from concerts.
	   Neary and his wife, Penelope, a part-time concerts secretary,
were dismissed in April after auditors raised questions about a
company they formed to handle the choir money.
	   The organist insisted it had been set up on the advice of
accountants to avoid tax problems and that there was no
impropriety. But Carr and other abbey leaders did not know of its
existence and the Nearys were accused of abusing their position
``to further their own financial gain.''
	   Neary's dismissal sent shock waves through the staff of the
900-year-old institution and brought wide criticism of Carr, whose
changes and modernization of procedures since his appointment last
year have established him as one of the more radical deans in the
abbey's history.
	   Neary had appealed to the queen because Westminster Abbey is a
``royal peculiar,'' falling under her sole jurisdiction, not that
of the church hierarchy.
	   Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey, spiritual leader of the
Church of England, called for a period of healing.
	   ``There may well be lessons for the future to be drawn from
recent events. There are certainly wounds to be healed,'' he said.
``But this must be a process of prayer and reflection, careful
thought and discussion.
	   ``Westminster Abbey is a special place with a special
significance for the church and for the nation. We all have an
interest in its continued well being.''

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Top U.S. economics and foreign policy specialists
arrived in Moscow on Wednesday for talks with top officials about
Russia's economic turmoil and the government's plans to tackle it.
	   The U.S. delegation, led by Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers and Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, was to
discuss reforms of the banking system, payments to creditors, and
preventing inflation.
	   Leon Fuerth, who assists Vice President Al Gore on foreign
policy issues, will also take part.
	   They were to meet with Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Yuri
Maslyukov on Thursday, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov on Friday, and
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Saturday, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   State Department deputy spokesman James Foley has said that
while the United States is worried by Russia's economic troubles,
it will only support Russia if it works harder to resolve its own
problems.
	   Primakov's government has yet to complete a budget for 1999. The
Cabinet was to tackle the tough task on Wednesday and Thursday.
	   Primakov has taken over day-to-day economic management as
President Boris Yeltsin has been suffering from a series of
illnesses this fall.

45 massacred, count of bodies pulled from well at 45

 &UR; By RACHID KHIARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ An armed band massacred 45 people in an
overnight attack on a mountain town west of Algiers, security
forces announced Wednesday. It was the bloodiest attack in recent
months, and the latest in a new spiral of violence.
	   In a separate development, security forces digging up a well
used as a mass grave said Wednesday they have now pulled 45 bodies
out. The work to clear out the 55-meter (180-foot) deep well was
far from over, they said.
	   A statement by security forces provided no details about
Wednesday's pre-dawn massacre in Tadjena, near Chlef, about 200 kms
(125 miles) west of the capital.
	   The statement said only that the massacre was committed by a
``terrorist band,'' language signifying Muslim insurgents blamed
for numerous such massacres in recent years.
	   Interior Minister Mustafa Benmansour visited the massacre site,
according to the statement.
	   More than 75,000 people have died in seven years of violence in
this North African nation.
	   While massacres have become a common form of violence here, the
last one to have taken such a high toll dates to last March when 52
people were reported killed at Had Sahary Youb, near Djelfa, some
250 kilometers (155miles) southwest of the capital.
	   Wednesday's massacre raised the death toll since the start of
the month to at least 115 people.
	   The Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which starts Dec. 20 this
year, has brings an increase in violence. The trend appeared to
confirm itself this year, with the approach of Ramadan.
	   South of the capital, in an area now referred to as the
``Triangle of Death,'' security forces said Wednesday they have now
dug 45 bodies from a well at the Hafiz farm in Meftah.
	   It is not known how many more people may have been thrown into
the well, which clearly served as a mass grave.
	   Officials said that two days ago a bomb was found inside the
well and there are now fears some bones could be booby-trapped.
	   Security forces are, therefore, working ``centimeter by
centimeter'' to reach the bottom of the well, which no longer
contains water.
	   Specialists date the mass grave from 1996 or 1997.
	   The insurgency erupted after the government canceled January
1992 elections the now banned Islamic Salvation Front was expected
to win.

Court reduces fine imposed on Ukraine's Communist leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A Kiev city court on Wednesday reduced the
fine imposed on Ukraine's Communist Party leader and a daily paper
for slandering a political scientist.
	   In October, a district court in Kiev ordered Petro Symonenko to
pay 20,000 hryvna (dlrs 5,800 at the time) in damages to Mykola
Tomenko, and ordered the Segodnya newspaper to come up with 10,000
hryvna (dlrs 2,900).
	   The sums were decreased following an appeal to 5,000 hryvna
(dlrs 1,460 at the current rate) for Symonenko and 2,500 hryvna
(dlrs 730) for the newspaper, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The scandal began last April when Symonenko, the Communist
leader, told Segodnya that Tomenko's independent Institute of
Politics had falsely claimed there were businessmen on the
Communist Party list in this year's parliamentary ballot.
	   Tomenko then sued Symonenko, saying the statements harmed him
and his professional reputation, seeking 100,000 hryvna (dlrs
24,240 at the time) in compensation from Symonenko and Segodnya.
	   The district court ruled that Symonenko's allegations harmed the
dignity and honor of Tomenko as a political scientist and a public
figure.
	   ``We're not satisfied by the court's decision to lower the sum
of the fine ... but will insist on it being implemented honestly,''
Tomenko told Interfax on Wednesday.
	   Tomenko said he might seek ``other ways of compensation'' from
Segodnya but was stricter about Symonenko. If the Communist leader
has no cash to pay the fine, he can sell his car, garage and some
land he owns, Tomenko said.

Russian intercepted after walking through the Channel Tunnel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DEBORAH SEWARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CALAIS, France (AP) _ A man was arrested today for walking
through the 30-mile undersea tunnel between England and France, a
feat that involved getting past heavy security and surviving the
vacuum-like winds of high-speed trains.
	   The jaywalker was arrested inside the tunnel not far from the
French port of Calais, where trains surface after racing under the
English Channel at speeds of up to 92 mph.
	   For reasons still unclear, the man apparently entered the tunnel
sometime over the weekend on the English side, police said.
	   They still were trying to figure out how the man, described only
as a 36-year-old Russian, was able to avoid detection by cameras
and get past high fences and barbed wire.
	   People have crossed the Channel by swimming but this is the
first time someone has walked across it, a feat that may be as
risky.
	   Police said it was a miracle the man survived because the train
rails are very close to each other and the high speed whips up
winds that can suck up objects like a vacuum cleaner.
	   Millions of people take the train each year through the Channel
Tunnel, which opened in 1994.

U.S. envoy insists Kosovo negotiations `still on track'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMS. UPDATES and RECASTS with Hill comments after talks,
details. Changes byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVE CARPENTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The top U.S. envoy for Kosovo
insisted Wednesday that diplomatic efforts aimed at resolving the
conflict are ``still on track'' despite rejection by all sides of
the latest peace proposals.
	   Christopher Hill spoke after launching a new round of shuttle
talks in the turbulent province, where the ethnic Albanian majority
and Serbian authorities have refused to budge from their main
demands.
	   An October truce that halted months of fighting between
separatist rebels and Serb forces is largely holding. But many
expect fighting to resume by spring if a political settlement is
not reached.
	   Hill, returning to the region from Washington, met for several
hours with ethnic Albanian negotiators in Pristina. He planned to
meet later with a political representative of the Kosovo Liberation
Army.
	   He has scheduled talks Thursday in Belgrade with the Serbian
side, which formally rejected the latest U.S. draft on Wednesday.
	   ``We believe that our negotiations are still on track,'' Hill,
who also is U.S. ambassador to neighboring Macedonia, told
reporters.
	   ``Ultimately the responsibility of reaching a settlement rests
with both sides,'' he said. ``They need to find ways to
compromise.''
	   Both Hill and Wolfgang Petritsch, the European Union envoy for
Kosovo, who joined in the talks, cited the urgency of trying to
reach a settlement soon in order to head off new fighting.
Petritsch expressed optimism that ``something should be achieved in
the next couple of weeks.''
	   ``This is a very decisive point in time,'' he said. ``We mustn't
lose the momentum.''
	   Based on their public statements, the gulf between the sides
appears huge. Hill admitted that ``it's not an easy process.''
	   The ethnic Albanian officials insist on a solution that would
break away Kosovo from Serbia, while the KLA has said it won't
accept anything short of outright independence.
	   Senior Serbian officials, including President Milan Milutinovic,
formally rejected the latest Hill plan Wednesday, reiterating
support for a Serb draft which keeps the province firmly within the
republic.
	   They did not elaborate in a statement issued by the official
Tanjug news agency. But a day earlier, Serbian negotiator Ratko
Markovic said the U.S. draft would require ``reconstructing the
whole of Yugoslavia'' and lead to independence for Kosovo.
	   Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians comprise about 90 percent of a
population of 2 million, had autonomy until then-Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic revoked it in 1989.
	   After KLA rebels began attacking the police forces that maintain
a massive presence in the province, Serbian forces launched a
crackdown last February that killed hundreds of people and uprooted
an estimated 300,000 from their homes.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ The investigation into the cause of the crash of
Swissair Flight 111 could take up to two years to complete, a
leading investigator told victims' families Wednesday.
	   Benoit Bouchard, chairman of Canada's Transportation Safety
Board, is meeting with the families of European victims in Paris
and Geneva to tell them how the investigation is proceeding.
	   He told journalists that the work was still at a very early
stage and he could not say how long it would take, but he ruled out
the possibility of it taking less than one year.
	   ``This inquiry is probably the most complicated that any country
has had to deal with in relation to an accident like this,'' said
Bouchard.
	   All 229 people on board were killed when the MD-11 jet bound
from New York to Geneva crashed into the sea off the coast of Nova
Scotia Sept. 2.
	   Bouchard said reconstruction of the debris would take much
longer than recovering the remains of the plane, which was
shattered by the force of the impact.
	   Investigators are concentrating on the cockpit area, where they
have found signs of extreme heat in the moments before the plane
went down. Some 80-85 per cent of the debris has been recovered.

U.N. team withdraws when refused entry to Baath Party office
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with seven U.N. teams visiting 10 sites, another team
arriving in Iraq in grafs 5th, 19th, 20th &QL; 
 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In a new challenge to the U.N. search for
illegal weapons in Iraq, a team of inspectors was turned back
Wednesday when it tried to enter a major office of the ruling Baath
Party, a key site of Saddam Hussein's government.
	   Richard Butler, head of the U.N. Special Commission, which
oversees inspections, called the Iraqi action ``a blockage.''
	   ``This was an absolutely legal no-notice inspection and they
blocked us,'' he told The Associated Press in New York.
	   The inspectors withdrew after an Iraqi official demanded that
they first provide a written declaration ``on the material and
items'' they sought, the official Iraqi News Agency said.
	   The incident _ which has the potential to blow into another
crisis _ came two days after Butler announced that he was ordering
the resumption of the so-called surprise inspections. On Tuesday,
the inspectors visited 32 sites and on Wednesday, 10 more.
	   Butler said the Iraqi demand for a written notice is ``simply
wrong'' and ``nonsense.''
	   Iraq, which had suspended the inspections in August, allowed
them to resume only last month, averting a military strike by the
United States and Britain. The two countries have left an armada in
the Gulf to ensure Iraq abides by its promise to cooperate with the
inspectors of the United Nations Special Commission.
	   But Wednesday's dispute elicited a cautious reaction from the
United States. David Leavy, a spokesman for the National Security
Council, said the administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton
awaits a report by Butler next week on Iraq's overall compliance
with U.N. requirements.
	   ``As the president has said, if UNSCOM cannot do its job
effectively, we remain poised to act,'' Leavy said. He declined to
say what would trigger U.S. military action.
	   UNSCOM must certify that Iraq has eliminated its chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons as well as long-range missiles
before U.N. economic sanctions can be lifted.
	   The sanctions were imposed after the 1990 Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait, and Iraqi officials have long insisted they have eliminated
all illegal weapons.
	   Wednesday's disagreement was played out outside one of the four
branch headquarters of the Baath Party in Baghdad.
	   A U.N. inspection team tried to get into the building at about 9
a.m. (0600 gmt) ``in a surprising and provocative manner,'' INA
said, quoting Gen. Hossam Mohammed Amin, who heads an office that
liaises with the inspectors.
	   He complained that the team was seeking a confrontation.
	   ``The practices of the inspectors .... have the clear goal of
creating crises and problems,'' Amin said.
	   The exact location of the headquarters was not immediately
known. But witnesses say a large team of U.N. inspectors gathered
in front of a Baath Party headquarters in the Baghdad neighborhood
of Adhamiya on Wednesday morning.
	   Ewen Buchanan, the inspectors' spokesman in New York, said this
round of inspections, which were scheduled to end Monday, would
continue. He did not know whether inspectors would try to enter the
site again.
	   As many as 140 inspectors on regular teams are working in Iraq
as well as some visiting experts, Caroline Cross, a U.N.
spokeswoman in Baghdad, said earlier. She would not give the exact
number involved but said it was ``a little less than 200,'' or the
entire contingent.
	   The Iraqi News Agency quoted Amin later as saying seven teams
visited 10 sites on Wednesday. Inspectors used helicopters in one
of the searches outside Baghdad, he said.
	   A team from the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is
responsible for inspections of Iraq's nuclear programs, also
arrived in Baghdad on Wednesday and met with Iraqi officials to
come up with a ``working schedule,'' Amin was quoted as saying.
	   Unannounced visits in the past have been a major source of
friction with Iraq, leading to three crises in the past year.
	   Iraqi newspapers carried further accounts Wednesday of comments
by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz in Moscow in which he said
there is a limit to Iraq's cooperation with the United Nations in
the search for weapons of mass destruction.
	   Meanwhile, in a letter released Wednesday, Iraqi Foreign
Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf appealed for help from Arab
countries, which he said had largely deserted Iraq.
	   In November, several key Arab countries declared that Iraq would
be held responsible for any conflict.

Palestinian killed in clashes ahead of Clinton visit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: For AMs, UPDATES throughout with quotes by Ross, Netanyahu &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Enraged by Israel's refusal to
release security prisoners, Palestinians stoned Israeli troops
Wednesday in the most widespread West Bank clashes in months. A
17-year-old stone mason was killed by Israeli gunfire and scores of
other Palestinians were injured.
	   The violence came despite U.S. appeals for calm and raised new
concerns that U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to the region
next week is triggering unrest, rather than reassuring Israelis and
Palestinians about their troubled peace accord, as intended.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu traded new recriminations Wednesday and said
they would not soften positions despite intensive U.S. efforts to
get the Wye River land-for-security accord back on track.
	   Netanyahu has suspended Israel's troop withdrawal in the West
Bank and said that with the Palestinians violating ``every part of
the agreement,'' he was not likely to change his views.
	   ``If they (the Palestinians) mend their ways, we'll continue
with the agreement,'' Netanyahu said. ``If they don't, we won't.''
	   A defiant Arafat said he would not drop demands that as part of
the Wye agreement, Israel release Palestinians jailed for
anti-Israeli activities and not just common criminals. ``We tell
our heroes in the prisons we will not close our eyes until we see
them in front of our eyes,'' Arafat told cheering supporters.
	   Netanyahu has said he told Arafat from the start that Israel
would not free those involved in attacks on Israelis and accused
the Palestinian Authority of inciting against Israel to achieve
with violence what it cannot get in negotiations.
	   While Wednesday's violent protests outside most West Bank towns
appeared to have been coordinated to some degree by Arafat's Fatah
faction, the issue also touched a raw nerve in Palestinian society
and many Palestinians joined in spontaneously. Nearly every family
has had members jailed by Israel in 30 years of occupation.
	   Assaf Barghouti, 21, who was shot in the arm by Israeli troops
during clashes north of the town of Ramallah, said he took to the
streets because his father has been held for three years without
charges and his uncle has already served 21 years of a life term
for an attack in which Israelis were killed.
	   ``If Netanyahu does not release the prisoners, this will be the
situation every day,'' Barghouti said from his hospital bed,
referring to the hours-long Ramallah clashes in which hundreds of
Palestinians burned tires and pelted Israeli troops with rocks.
	   Barghouti's grandfather, Salah, 74, dressed in a long brown
robe, said he backed the rioters. ``I was out there with them,
collecting rocks and giving them to the young men,'' he said.
	   A 17-year-old stone mason, Jihad Iyad, died at Ramallah Hospital
after being shot in the chest by Israeli troops. In Jerusalem, Nasr
Erekat, a 21-year-old university student and cousin of chief
Palestinian peace negotiator Saeb Erekat, died of injuries
sustained two days earlier. Both were to be buried Thursday.
	   In all, 87 Palestinians were injured Wednesday by rubber bullets
and three by live rounds. Six Israelis, including two soldiers and
two riot policemen, were hurt by stones.
	   Hoping to calm the situation before Clinton's arrival Saturday
night, the U.S. Mideast peace coordinator, Dennis Ross, held talks
with Netanyahu and Arafat to try to settle the disputes.
	   On the prisoner issue, Ross appeared to be siding with Israel,
saying that ``the prime minister is doing what he said he would
do.'' Under the Wye accord, Israel is to release 750 prisoners by
the end of January. In a first stage, Netanyahu freed 250, most of
them criminals.
	   Ross also said he was trying to prevent a new argument over the
procedures for revoking provisions in the PLO founding charter
calling for Israel's destruction.
	   On Monday, the Palestine National Council, the Palestinians'
parliament-in-exile, is to reaffirm a decision by lesser bodies to
annul those clauses. Both Arafat and Clinton will speak to the
delegates. Netanyahu insists the PNC take a vote, but the
Palestinians say a vote is not required. Invitations to the PNC
gathering inform delegates the purpose is to hear Clinton speak.
	   Ross said he was trying to arrange a compromise.
	   ``The procedure that will be worked out will make it very clear
once and for all that the charter is nullified,'' Ross said.

Spain silent over British decision on Pinochet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Britain-Pinochet

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Britain's decision to allow Spanish
extradition proceedings against Gen. Augusto Pinochet met with a
stony silence from the Spanish government Wednesday.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's office and the foreign
ministry both said they had no comment on the announcement by Home
Secretary Jack Straw in London.
	   Aznar's government has made clear it does not support Judge
Baltasar Garzon's efforts to put the former Chilean dictator on
trial in Spain on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture.
	   But Aznar has stated repeatedly since Pinochet was arrested in
London on Oct. 16 on a warrant from Garzon that the case was one
for the courts to decide and neither he nor his government would
interfere.
	   The Aznar government has said that eight years after Pinochet
stepped down, Chile still has delicate political dynamics because
of deep divisions between supporters and critics of Pinochet, now
83.
	   Spain also has lucrative trade ties and major investments in
Chile, and Aznar is seen as eager to protect them.
	   However, the government, sticking to its official position,
reluctantly passed on Garzon's formal extradition request on Nov.
5.
	   Meanwhile human rights groups welcomed Straw's decision, which
sets the stage for months of legal wrangling in Britain as Pinochet
fights extradition.
	   ``We believe it is a coherent decision,'' said Francisco Perez,
a human rights activist who works for United Left, a political
party that had filed suit three years ago asking Judge Garzon to
charge Pinochet.
	   ``We think it is the best possible news on the 50th anniversary
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,'' Perez said.
	   ``Human rights cannot be just a matter of idle talk. The British
government and Judge Garzon are showing that one can fight against
impunity.''
	   Carlos Iriart, head of the Movement against Impunity, a key
anti-Pinochet group in Spain, said, ``we are not used to receiving
good news.''
	   Of Straw's decision, he added: ``It represents a new orientation
in international law that ends the impunity of those who have
committed human rights. Today we can say that a new era has
begun.''

Eritrea: Sudan shelled two border villages in Eritrea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Eritrea has filed a complaint with the
United Nations, accusing Sudan of shelling two border villages, a
senior Eritrean official said Wednesday.
	   Presidential adviser Yemane Gebremeskel said the Sudanese army
fired long-range artillery shells on Saturday at Arbaate Asher and
Alighider, about 125 miles (200 kilometers) west of the capital,
Asmara.
	   No one was hurt and Eritrean forces did not retaliate,
Gebremeskel said.
	   Sudan has claimed its army was shelled from inside Eritrea last
month. It was unclear who was alleged to have fired the shells, but
Sudan says Eritrea allows Sudanese rebel bases on its territory _
an accusation Eritrea denies.
	   A Sudanese rebel office operates out of Eritrea's capital, while
Sudan acknowledges it supports Eritrean rebels.
	   The foreign ministers of the two countries met in Qatar on Nov.
10, and signed an agreement calling for regular talks. Sudanese
President Omar el-Bashir said in late November that a complete end
to hostilities with Eritrea was imminent.
	   Sudanese officials were not immediately available for coment.

Court throws out appeal in Mykonos trial convictions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ A federal court threw out an appeal
Wednesday by three men convicted in the 1992 slaying of four
Iranian-Kurdish opposition figures at Berlin's Mykonos Restaurant.
	   A three-judge panel rejected complaints that a Berlin court had
weighted evidence unfairly during the 1997 trial. It also ruled
that the court was correct in considering a confession by one of
the suspects, even though he had withdrawn the confession during
the trial.
	   The so-called Mykonos trial drew international attention as
possibly the first in the West where a court considered charges
that Iranian leaders directed the killings of dissidents abroad.
	   The ruling _ which implicated Iran's powerful spiritual leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani _
shook the foundation of German-Iranian relations.
	   Both countries withdrew their ambassadors within hours of the
verdict, and only this year did Iran and Germany's foreign
ministers re-establish direct communication in keeping with
improved ties.
	   The court in Berlin convicted two men of murder and two of being
accessories to murder in the Sept. 17, 1992, killing of Kurdish
leader Sadiq Sarafkindi and three of his associates.
	   The appeal was filed by Kazem Darabi, an Iranian, and Abbas
Rhayel, a Lebanese, both serving life prison sentences; and Mohamid
Atris, who is serving a sentence of five years and three months.
	   Youssef Amin, who was sentenced to 11 years in prison, did not
participate in the appeal.

Weightlifter returns positive test to banned substance

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Jordanian weightlifter returned a
positive test to a banned substance at the Asian Games, officials
said Thursday.
	   Ayed Jassar Khawaldeh, 25, tested positive to diuretic
triamterene and both A and B samples had been tested, the Olympic
Council of Asia said.
	   Khawaldeh admitted taking the substance, which helped him reduce
weight to compete in the 56-kilogram division, the OCA said. His
usual body weight is 60 kilograms but he weighed in at 55.8
kilograms on the day of competition Monday. He was seventh.
	   ``The weightlifter said that he used the substance when he was
on a three-week training camp,'' OCA said in a statement.
	   He has been expelled from the athletes' village, had his results
voided and will face a two-year ban from the International
Weightlifting Federation.

Poet Jose Hierro wins Cervantes literary prize
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spanish poet Jose Hierro, who wrote about
life in prison under the Franco regime, on Wednesday won the 1998
Miguel de Cervantes prize, considered the top literary award in the
Spanish-speaking world.
	   Hierro, 76, beat out a field of 38 Spanish and Latin American
authors, the Culture Ministry said.
	   ``He is an exceptional poet whose career has been tenacious,
demanding and honest,'' the jury said praising his verses as ``part
of a universal poetry.''
	   The Madrid-born writer published his first poems in different
Republican publications during Spain's 1936-39 Civil War.
	   After the war he spent four years in prison, an experience that
he would later capture in his most acclaimed works _ ``Lullaby for
a Prisoner'' and ``Report''.
	   Other well-known works include ``Land without Us'', ``Joy'',
``The Class of '42'' and ``With the Stones, with the Wind.''
	   A noisy bar in Madrid next to his home is known to be his
favorite place to sit and write. These poems, he has said, stem
from ``grief that is like hunger''.
	   Hierro has also won the Prince of Asturias prize for Literature
in 1981 and the Queen Sofia Prize for Iberoamerican Poetry in 1995.
	   The Cervantes Prize is presented for lifetime achievement and
not for any one specific work. King Juan Carlos will present the
winners 15 million pesetas (dlrs 105,000) during an April 23
ceremony to commemorate the 1616 death of Cervantes, the author of
``Don Quixote.''
	   Hierro's latest work is ``Notebook in New York'' which was
published this year.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Despite an impressive new stadium and rich Olympic
tradition, Paris starts as an outsider in its efforts to stage the
2008 Olympic Games.
	   But supporters of its bid, officially launched Tuesday, still
hope to succeed where France's two recent bids for the summer games
failed.
	   Bids by Paris for 1992 and Lille for 2004 lacked political will
and a major stadium, two problems that Paris bid organizers hope
are now resolved.
	   Officials hope that the 80,000-capacity Stade de France, built
for the World Cup and less than a year old, will help the French
cause.
	   ``With the Stade de France, we have a strong argument in our
favor,'' said Paul Huchon, president of the Paris regional council.
	   But Paris lacks other facilities, notably an Olympic pool and
cycling track, he said.
	   International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Juan Antonio
Samaranch welcomed the Paris candidacy, pointing out that Paris was
the home of modern Olympic movement founder Pierre de Coubertin.
	   And Henri Serandour, president of the French Olympic Committee,
said that the 2008 bid stands a much better chance of success than
France's two recent bids to hold the summer games.
	   ``Paris found itself in competition with Barcelona, Samaranch's
city, in 1992. And everyone knew that it would be difficult for
Lille, with great competition from important capitals like Rome and
Athens,'' Serandour said.
	   ``France confirmed its capacity to host global events with the
World Cup. And French sports have had excellent results this year,
which gives a good impression,'' Serandour said.
	   And Alain Danet, vice president of the 1992 Paris bid, said that
France obtained vital organizing experience with the Albertville
winter games in 1992 and the soccer World Cup.
	   ``In 1985 we could say `we will know what to do.' Now we can say
`we know what to do,''' Danet said.
	   Other candidates for the 2008 games include early favorite
Beijing; Toronto; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Buenos Aires, Argentina;
Istanbul, Turkey; Osaka, Japan, and Seville, Spain.
	   There is a strong body of opinion that cities rarely win an
Olympic bid on the first attempt and it's advisable to get into
position for a successful run four years later.
	   With Athens hosting the 2004 Olympics, the IOC is likely to
choose a non-European city in 2008. Paris could be in a strong
position for 2012.
	   ``It's true that we have a handicap because we are in Europe and
Athens will host the 2004 Games. And we have a rival in Beijing,
which was beaten by Sydney for 2000. So it will be difficult to win
the race,'' said Paris Mayor Jean Tiberi.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Researchers said Wednesday
they have discovered the oldest complete skeleton of a human
ancestor, a 4-foot-tall ape-man dating back 3.2 to 3.6 million
years.
	   The find could shed light on a pivotal debate about human
origins: was early man just a plains dweller or also a
tree-climber?
	   Ron Clarke, a British paleo-anthropologist at the University of
Witwatersrand who made the find, and his colleague Phillip Tobias
announced they uncovered the skull and leg bones belonging to foot
and ankle fragments Clarke found in 1994.
	   The skull and legs are still embedded in iron-hard rock in a
cave near Johannesburg. The rock is expected to yield the pelvis,
vertebrae and other limb bones as workers chip away the material
around them, said Clarke.
	   ``It's one of many missing links from ape to man,'' said Clarke
at a news conference.
	   He said the skeleton is ``closer to the ape end'' rather than
the modern human end of evolution. Human ancestors developed after
an evolutionary split with the ancestors of apes.
	   Clarke and Tobias contend that a large articulated big toe on
the 1994 find implied that human ancestors, as they evolved from
apes, walked upright like men and climbed trees like some primates.
	   But other paleontologists argue that to qualify as a human
ancestor, ape-men must have walked only on two feet, a development
they say took place on the open plains.
	   ``Everyone is pretty sure we came from tree-living animals,''
said Richard Sherwood, assistant professor of anthropology at the
University of Wisconsin in a telephone interview. ``It's a matter
of when the transition occurred somewhere.''
	   Once the bones are pried from the rock _ a process expected to
take another year _ they can be examined to see if the hip and leg
structures bear out the tree-climbing theory.
	   In a telephone interview from London, a top expert on human
origins said the finding of a complete skeleton is rare in the
study of early man, and potentially very important once it's out of
the ground.
	   But the expert, Chris Stringer, head of the human origins
research group at the Natural History Museum in London, added:
``Some people questioned whether (Clarke and Tobias) were going too
far in drawing a conclusion that it was a divergent big toe.''
	   The discovery, documented Wednesday in the South African Journal
of Science, was to be reported as a news item in the magazine
Nature in London on Thursday.
	   The skeleton was discovered underground at Sterkfontein, a
former lime quarry cave that has yielded a number of hominid skulls
since the 1930s.
	   Clarke and Tobias said it appeared the Australopithecus
africanus, as it is known scientifically, fell down a 15-meter
(45-foot) shaft. Believed to have been 4 feet tall (1.20 meters),
the creature lived in a wooded area and was capable of climbing
trees, Clarke said.
	   Scientists determined the creature's date of origin by examining
the rock. Fragments of older hominid fossils have been found in
Kenya, where Meave Leakey _ the daughter-in-law of famous East
African paleo-anthropologists Lawrence and Mary Leakey _ discovered
a 4 million year-old Australopithecus afarensis.
	   The skeleton _ unnamed until its sex can be determined _ could
provide vital information about links between early man in East and
southern Africa. Stringer said the skeleton could be an even more
primitive species than expected.
	   ``What was its life style, how much time did it spend on the
ground?'' Stringer asked. ``It will be important to see what this
is. Will it show links to East Africa?''
	   After the 1994 find, Clarke and his team said they uncovered
more bones belonging to the foot and ankle while rummaging through
animal bones at a university cupboard in 1997. The find sent them
back to Sterkfontein to search for the rest of the skeleton.
	   The find of a complete australopithecus skeleton will help
researchers fill the gaps in other discoveries, Clarke said.
	   Previously, the most complete early hominid was ``Lucy,'' a 3.2
million year old Australopithecus whose partial skeleton _ and only
fragments of the skull _ were discovered in 1974 in Ethiopia. The
oldest complete skeleton before this latest discovery dates was
Homo Erectus in Kenya. That dates back to 1.5 million years ago.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A North Korean and a South Korean
joined the weightlifting world record spree Wednesday, but a
Jordanian lifter was thrown out of the Asian Games after the
event's first positive drug test.
	   Ayed Jassar Khawaldeh, 25, was disqualified for using a banned
diuretic to drop down to a lower weight class, the Olympic Council
of Asia said. He placed seventh Monday in the 56-kilogram division.
The OCA said both his tests were positive, and he admitted taking
the substance.
	   In another investigation, North Korea's female gymnasts were
cleared of suspicion that they were underage. Officials demanded to
check their passports, and said the documents showed the gymnasts
met the minimum age of 16.
	   In competition, Japanese identical twins finished 1-2 in a
swimming sprint.
	   But even with a world champion sick and out of the lineup,
China's swimmers recovered from a shutout the previous night and
won three gold medals, contributing to a 12-gold day that pushed
the nation's leading total to 25 golds.
	   The Chinese added two more gymnastics golds to their collection,
and won three in shooting, two in weightlifting, one in canoeing
and one in fencing,
	   South Korea was the third day's other big winner, with eight
golds _ three of them in its native martial art of taekwondo and
three in Japan's sport of judo. Weightlifter Kim Hak-bong's world
record lift in the jerk contributed to another, and Lee Ji-yean,
averaging 221.67, led a South Korean medals sweep in women's
singles bowling.
	   That brought the Koreans even with Japan at 16 golds. Japan
managed only four Wednesday _ two in swimming, one in shooting and
one in billiards.
	   Kazakstan moved up to six with three in canoeing, an event in
which Uzbekistan won its first gold of these games.
	   In women's weightlifting, North Korean Ri Song Hui had to settle
for a silver medal behind China's Chen Yanqing in the 58-kilogram
division despite her record jerk.
	   Chen became the third Chinese woman in three nights to set a
world record, breaking her own 8-month-old record of 97.5 kilograms
in the snatch, lifting 98.0.
	   She also beat the old record in the jerk with a lift of 123.5,
but North Korea's Ri grabbed away the record minutes later by
hoisting 125.0. China's Xu Xiongying had set the old world mark of
123.0 in May.
	   Chen won the gold with a total of 220.0 to 217.5 for Ri.
Thailand's Khassaraporn Suta took the bronze with 210.0.
	   South Korean Kim's world record jerk of 195.0 kilograms was five
kilograms over the world standard set up as a basis for records
when weight classes were realigned.
	   With that, he won gold with a total of 340.0. China's Wan
Jianhui also had 340 _ a snatch of 155 and jerk of 185 _ but had to
settle for silver because of heavier body weight.
	   ``Unlucky, very unlucky,'' Wan said of his silver. ``I did not
expect that Kim could lift that much.''
	   At gymnastics, China added the men's and women's all-around
titles to its men's and women's team championships.
	   Liu Xuan finished far ahead in the women's all-around with
38.787 points to 37.912 for Kazakstan's Irina Yevdokimova and
37.300 for Japan's Risa Sugawara.
	   In the men's competition, Chinese veteran Huang Xu and newcomer
Yang Wei took gold and silver, ahead of Japan's Naoya Tsukahara,
the son of five-time Olympic gold medalist Mitsuo Tsukahara.
	   On the sidelines, games officials were demanding to see the
North Korean gymnasts' passports after rival coaches, as well as
officials and doctors, raised questions about their ages. None has
won any medals.
	   Japan's twin swimming speedsters are Shunsuke, the slightly
elder of the two 22-year-olds, and Shusuke Ito. Shunsuke was first
and Susuke second in the men's 100-meter freestyle.
	   ``I'm just really happy to have a 1-2 with my brother,'' the
winning brother said. They are good friends as well as strong
competitors and discussed their tactics before the race.
	   Japan's Tomoko Hagiwara was first in the women's 100 backstroke,
beating compatriot Mai Nakamura and South Korea's Choi Soo-min.
	   Fu Yong, one of seven Chinese swimmers who served a two-year ban
after testing positive for steroids at the 1994 games, made a
winning comeback in the men's 200-meter backstroke. Fu's time was
the fourth fastest in the world this year.
	   In the absence of world champion Chen Yan, out with a stomach
ailment, teammate Chen Hau won the women's 400-meter freestyle.
	   But even after China won the women's 4x100 freestyle relay, the
Chinese still trailed Japan 8-6 in golds after 15 swimming events.
	   China won three of the day's four golds in shooting, while Japan
beat China for the women's rifle team gold based on a tie-break
formula.
	   Host Thailand gained its fourth gold of these games when Prasert
Panturat, averaging 227, won the men's gold in bowling.
	   South Korea's judo victories included Yoo Sung-yeon's upset of
the third of Japan's famed Nakamura brothers in the games _ 1993
world champion Yoshio _ in the 90-kilogram category.

Gulf leaders agree to extend oil cuts until end of next year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with fresh quotes by GCC secretary-general &QL; 
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Gulf Arab states decided
Wednesday to extend an earlier cut in oil production until the end
of next year in a bid to hold up falling world prices that have
squeezed their petrodollar economies.
	   Ending a three-day summit, leaders of the six-nation Gulf
Cooperation Council also urged other oil producers to undertake
similar cuts ``to achieve market stability for the benefit of
producers and consumers.''
	   GCC Secretary-General Jamil al-Hojeilan said the production cut
``was one of the most important issues discussed by the heads of
state.''
	   A statement issued at the end of the summit said the GCC leaders
``agreed to extend their pledged cuts until the end of 1999.''
	   The statement referred to the pledges made in June by members of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and producers
outside the cartel to withdraw 3.1 million barrels a day from the
market for one year until June 1999. OPEC's share of that was 2.6
million barrels per day.
	   Four GCC constituents _ Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar,
Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates _ are also members of OPEC and
together control half the world's proven reserves of oil.
	   The non-OPEC members of GCC are Oman and Bahrain.
	   This year's summit was overshadowed by record-low oil prices
stemming from a depressed demand in recession-hit Asia and a warm
winter in the West. The GCC states depend on oil exports for 75
percent of their revenue.
	   Two weeks ago, OPEC ministers meeting at a year-end conference
failed to agree on measures to halt the slide in oil prices but
decided to review the situation in March.
	   Al-Hojeilan declined to say whether the GCC would consider more
production cuts at the OPEC meeting, or during a proposed GCC
meeting of either ministers or heads of state.
	   A Gulf official said the leaders did not agree to deeper cuts
immediately because they were not convinced that it would shore up
the market.
	   However, the decision could be reviewed at the OPEC meeting in
March if prices continue to slide, said the official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   On Tuesday, Hojeilan blamed overproduction by oil-rich nations
for the price slump.
	   He told the Middle East Broadcasting Corp., an Arabic TV
network, that ``the whole problem'' was caused by countries not
sticking to their production quotas.
	   Analysts say Venezuela, Iran, Indonesia and Qatar are the main
over-producers.
	   Shortly before the GCC meeting began, January futures contracts
for Brent crude _ a widely watched benchmark _ fell to a record low
of dlrs 9.92 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange in
London.
	   Gulf oil generally sells at a dollar or two less than the North
Sea's Brent _ which itself was selling for around dlrs 20 a barrel
as recently as 1997.
	   At the start of the summit Monday, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince
Abdullah warned that the oil boom days were over and that Gulf
states should face the new reality and tighten their belts.
	   The leaders at the summit also decided to draw up a customs
union and implement it in the year 2001. The idea has been
discussed for 15 years.
	   The union, the first step to a common market, is a prerequisite
for free trade deals with other trading blocs such as the GCC's
main trading partner, the European Union.
	   The summit-end statement also called on Iraq to unconditionally
respect all U.N. resolutions.
	   Referring to U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait, the communique blamed Iraq for the continuing U.N.
sanctions.
	   ``Iraq must admit that the invasion of Kuwait was illegal and
must prove its peaceful intentions towards Kuwait and other
regional nations,'' the communique said.
	   The resolution also urged Iran to work for a peaceful settlement
of a territorial dispute with the Emirates. Both states claim Abu
Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs, three small islands that
were annexed by Iran in 1992.

International officials, Bosnian Serbs sign agreement on police
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ After six months of
negotiations, Bosnian Serbs on Wednesday signed an agreement with
international officials to reorganize the police force in the part
of Bosnia they control.
	   The agreement calls for hiring non-Serbs for the Bosnian Serb
police force as well as changes in training and
``democratization.'' The agreement was signed with U.N. officials.
	   Restructuring of war-time Bosnian Serb police according to
international standards was envisaged by 1995 Dayton peace accords
which ended more than three years of fighting in Bosnia.
	   ``This agreement is a sign that Republika Srpska supports the
Dayton Agreement and is moving closer to its natural place in
Europe,'' said Elizabeth Rehn, the U.N. special envoy, referring to
the Serb-run half of Bosnia.
	   Rehn said months-long negotiations on the agreement had been
``difficult'' at some stages, particularly over hiring other ethnic
groups. But she said the agreement presented ``something Republika
Srpska could implement with pride.''
	   Bosnian Serbs fought the war against Muslims and Croats in
Bosnia with an aim to create their own state. The Dayton peace
accords divided Bosnia roughly in two halves with joint, central
institutions.
	   ``We believe this agreement provides for the highest level of
professionalism and structuring of the police according to civic
principles and equality,'' said Bosnian Serb president Nikola
Poplasen.
	   U.N. troops participating in international police units in
Bosnia will help train Bosnian Serb police.

Ciba Specialty Chemicals, Clariant call off merger
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ A month after they announced they
would merge, Swiss firms Ciba Specialty Chemicals and Clariant said
Wednesday they have called off merger talks.
	   The merger, which would have formed the world's largest maker of
specialty chemicals and dyes, was intended to counter the global
downturn that has undermined their sales growth.
	   But Ciba and Clariant said closer examination revealed
commercial, financial, legal and regulatory risks and constraints
in executing the planned transaction which would affect the future
merged company.
	   The companies' boards ``considered the risks to be so
significant as to undermine the future benefits and synergies as
stated as part of the planned merger,'' they said in a statement.
	   The firms regret having to terminate the planned merger after a
period of ``constructive and open negotiations,'' the statement
added. Both companies agreed not to disclose confidential
information.
	   The fusion would have created a chemical group with sales of
around 18 billion Swiss francs (dlrs 12.9 billion) a year.
	   Some two years ago, the firms' parent corporations joined to
form chemicals giant Novartis.
	   The merged company was to retain the Clariant name, which was
given to the spin off from the Swiss drug group Sandoz AG in the
Novartis creation. The merger would have caused the demise of the
Ciba name, left over from former parent Ciba-Geigy AG.
	   Specialty chemicals are used to enhance the durability,
performance, color and feel of materials used to produce clothes,
packaging, household appliances, automobiles and other industrial
and consumer goods.

Gulf leaders agree to extend oil cuts until end of 1999
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Gulf Arab states on
Wednesday decided to extend until the end of 1999 an earlier cut in
oil production in a bid to hold up falling world prices that have
squeezed their petrodollar economies.
	   Ending a three-day summit, leaders of the six-nation Gulf
Cooperation Council also urged other oil producers to undertake
similar cuts ``to achieve market stability for the benefit of
producers and consumers.''
	   GCC Secretary-General Jamil al-Hojeilan told reporters that
production cut ``was one of the most important issues discussed by
the heads of state.''
	   A statement issued at the end of the summit said the GCC leaders
``agreed to extend their pledged cuts until the end of 1999.''
	   The statement refers to the pledges made in June by members of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and producers
outside the cartel to withdraw 3.1 million barrels a day from the
market for one year until June 1999. OPEC's share of that was 2.6
million barrels per day.
	   Four GCC's constituents _ Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar,
Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates _ are members of OPEC and
together control half the world's proven reserves of oil.
	   The non-OPEC members of GCC are Oman and Bahrain.
	   On Tuesday, Gulf sources attending the meetings had told The
Associated Press that GCC oil ministers agreed to further
production cuts but that was denied by al-Hojeilan.
	   Oil producing countries have differed widely among themselves on
how to control the record-low oil prices, caused by depressed
demand in recession-hit Asia and a warm winter in the West. The GCC
states depend on oil exports for 75 percent of their revenue.

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Runaway Australian soccer star Marko
Viduka has been allowed by Celtic owner Fergus McCann to take a
short vacation and then return to Scotland to play for his new
team.
	   Viduka, who fled Scotland two days after signing for Celtic from
Croatia Zagreb last week, issued a statement saying he wanted to be
left alone during his vacation. But he promised he would soon be
playing for the Scottish club.
	   ``Of course I regret that my intention to play for Celtic has
not yet been fulfilled,'' he said in a statement issued through the
club. ``I do appreciate the club's understanding.
	   ``All I want right now is to be left alone to recover from the
stress of my last few months in Zagreb. I want to play football
again soon, and when I am ready, I want it to be for Celtic.''

EU takes Italy, Belgium and Finland to court over wild birds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission said Wednesday
it was taking legal action against Italy, Belgium and Finland over
their alleged failure to comply with regulations on the protection
of wild birds.
	   The Commission said it was hauling Belgium and Italy before at
the European Court of Justice, while Finland was sent an official
warning.
	   Last week the European Union's executive body asked the court to
impose daily fines on France for its failure to shorten the bird
hunting season in line with EU rules.
	   According to Commission statements, Belgium has failed to
implement EU legislation forbidding the sale of certain wild bird
products; Italy flaunts rules on the use of captured birds as
hunting decoys and Finland has not set up enough bird sancturaries.

Despite Israeli protests, Palestinians prepare for state visit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC_Israel-Palestinians
 &UR; Eds: FIXES style on print shop to Alwan in lead, graf 15 &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ ``Clinton visits Palestine,'' read
the posters cluttering the Alwan print shop.
	   Even if the U.S. president doesn't understand the Arabic caption
beneath his smiling face, the picture will be clear when he arrives
next week: Palestinians are getting ready for a state visit to an
entity Bill Clinton is not quite ready to call a state.
	   When he lands at Gaza International Airport on Monday, a
khaki-clad honor guard will blast ``The Star Spangled Banner'' on
bagpipes _ and then launch in to ``Biladi, Biladi'' (My Homeland,
My Homeland), a fiercely nationalist anthem that Israel banned
during its occupation of Gaza.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has made it clear that he sees
Clinton's visit as nothing less than a state visit, and there are
signs that the Clinton administration is edging closer to
recognizing Palestinian aspirations to statehood.
	   In May, Hillary Rodham Clinton expressed support for statehood,
speaking to a youth gathering in Geneva. Aides quickly said she was
speaking her own mind _ but the statement was seen as her husband's
trial balloon.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government is loathe to
confer any recognition of statehood on Arafat, arguing that this
would pre-empt the outcome of future talks on the final status of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   Clinton has deferred to some Israeli concerns _ a helicopter
will land at Gaza airport instead of Air Force One, as originally
planned _ but both the Israelis and Palestinians agree that the
visit amounts to recognition.
	   Clinton will also visit Israel, but with the U.S.-brokered Wye
River peace accord collapsing under a wave of violence and mutual
recriminations two months after it was signed in Maryland, the
first-ever visit by a sitting president to Gaza stings in Israel.
	   The Yediot Ahronot newspaper reported that nine out of 17
ministers were now against the Clinton visit.
	   ``It's not the right time,'' Education Minister Yitzhak Levy
told Yediot. ``No doubt, the Palestinians will use his arrival for
international advances beyond the commitments'' of Wye.
	   The trappings of Clinton's visit are overwhelming its original
purpose, his presence at a convening of the Palestine National
Council that will delete passages from the PLO founding charter
calling for Israel's destruction.
	   The airport honor guard will be made up of members of Arafat's
elite bodyguard ``Force 17.''
	   If Clinton proceeds through Gaza city in a motorcade _
Palestinian security won't confirm that until Monday _ he will gaze
out at spotless streets, scrubbed clean for his visit.
	   He will pass marching high-school girls clad in blue uniforms,
high-school boys dressed in brown. Toddlers will line sidewalks,
armed with freshly-printed Palestinian and U.S. flags.
	   Clinton's presence had only one meaning for Alwan print shop
owner George Tarazi, commissioned by Arafat's office to print
10,000 posters.
	   ``This visit means for us, the Palestinians, that the United
States now is putting us again on the map of the world as an
independent state,'' he said Wednesday.
	   The Gaza municipal spokesman described the visit as
``historic.''
	   ``We asked the owner of the shops to paint their walls and we
are going to send our teams to clean the streets and to plant trees
in the Gaza Streets,'' Hamdi Abu-Kahresh said.
	   For one Gaza perfume merchant, U.S. recognition of statehood _
implicit or not _ had practical implications.
	   ``This visit will open a new page,'' he said, ``when American
businessmen can come here and invest in Palestine.''

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A strike by private minibus drivers left
thousands of commuters stranded in downtown Nairobi Wednesday as
operators of the main mode of public transportation protested new
traffic regulations.
	   The privately-owned vans, known as ``matatus'', operate
transport throughout Kenya and provide an estimated 70 percent of
passanger transport in the capital Nairobi.
	   Last week, the Nairobi Provincial Commissioner Joseph Kaguthi
said the new regulations aimed at disciplining the animated, but
often reckless drivers and conductors, would take effect this week.
	   The regulations call for all matatus to remove music systems
from the vehicles, for each driver to have and maintain a
certificate of good conduct renewable every three months, and
insist the often multi-colored vans be painted in a single color.
	   In defiant protest, the matatus cruised downtown Nairobi in a
convoy Wednesday, playing loud music but refusing to pick up
passengers.
	   The conductors, known as touts who are often seen hanging out
the side door of the vans to solicit business, waved twigs out the
doors and shouted ``Kaguthi must go.''
	   Police deployed at the main downtown traffic circles to ensure
the matatus did not disrupt traffic.
	   Nairobi matatus are notorious for overloading the vans, driving
recklessly, playing loud music and obstructing traffic as they
aggressively compete for passengers.
	   The alternate means of public transport in Nairobi, the Kenya
Bus Service, runs a fleet of 191 buses, does not have capacity for
the capital's more than two million residents.
	   ``The country has a lot of problems, people are stealing
millions and nobody asks them. Is having several colors on a matatu
really a priority?'' said John Kamau, one of the drivers.
	   He said the drivers and touts were not objecting so much to the
new regulations as to the short time frame given them to make the
changes.

Turkish premier-designate seeks support for a minority government

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's premier-designate tried a new
tack Wednesday in trying to form a new, pro-secular government,
indicating he might settle for a smaller, weaker coalition that
would depend on outside parties for support.
	   Bulent Ecevit has tried for two weeks to form a viable governing
coalition without Parliament's largest party, the Islamic-oriented
Virtue Party. Former Premier Tansu Ciller made his effort harder
when she refused to join any coalition that included her chief
rival, former Premier Mesut Yilmaz.
	   Ecevit proposed Wednesday forming a center-left, minority
government _ a coalition whose parties in themselves could not
command a majority of votes in parliament. He did not say which
parties would be in the coalition.
	   Mrs. Ciller said her center-right True Path Party might support
the minority government, but not as a member of the coalition, and
only if all the other parties in parliament agreed as well.
	   ``We are supporting his bid _ with the condition that he
receives wider support in parliament,'' Mrs. Ciller said.
	   She has been insisting that on a broader coalition that would
include Islamic Virtue.
	   The military, self-appointed guardians of Turkey's secular
system, is adamantly opposed to the inclusion of Virtue.
	   Turkey's president asked Ecevit last week to try to form
Turkey's next government. The last government, led by Yilmaz, fell
Nov. 25 after 17 months in office. It was brought down by
corruption and mafia scandals.
	   With his sudden change of tactic, Ecevit signaled that he would
not return the mandate to form a new government to President
Suleyman Demirel before he tries out all options.
	   ``I don't give up easily,'' said Ecevit, leader of the
Democratic Left Party.
	   If he fails again, Demirel could choose any member of parliament
to head the government until elections in April.

Le Pen dismisses deputy, accusing him of inciting rebellion

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen dismissed
his longtime lieutenant, Bruno Megret, from his position in the
extreme-right party Wednesday, only hours after Megret defied him
by calling for an emergency congress to solve their differences.
	   It was the latest rapid-fire development in the ugly feud
between Le Pen and his heir apparent that burst onto the surface
over the weekend.
	   In a statement, Le Pen said he had named Carl Lang, the party's
vice president, as general delegate in place of Megret.
	   ``The comments he has made ... and his call to rebellion justify
that I remove him from the position of general delegate,'' Le Pen's
statement said.
	   Le Pen, 70, has been the absolute leader of the far-right party
for a quarter-century. But his increasingly public struggle with
the quieter and more pragmatic _ though no less ideological _
Megret has weakened his hand.
	   Two hours before Le Pen's move, Megret had held a news
conference to demand the urgent meeting of the party's 50,000 or so
members nationwide _ a demand that Le Pen, in his statement, termed
an effort ``to destabilize the movement.''
	   ``I will never leave the National Front, neither by resigning
nor by being pushed out,'' Megret told the packed news conference.
	   ``The situation in the National Front is very serious,'' Megret
said. ``It is time to return to peace and unity.''
	   Megret insisted that his move was not aimed against Le Pen
personally.
	   ``If he sees this as a putsch, that is completely incorrect,''
Megret said.
	   But asked whether the party congress would consider electing a
new president, Megret said only: ``I don't want to enter into those
considerations.''
	   The feud between Le Pen and Megret has been obvious for months.
But it burst into the open over the weekend, at a noisy party
meeting where Le Pen ejected several Megret supporters he had fired
a few days earlier.
	   On Monday, a Le Pen loyalist, Serge Martinez, director of
personnel at the party, spoke out against his boss, and was
immediately fired _ along with three others the same day.
	   Speculation mounted that the National Front would finally split
over the bitter struggle. Some thought Megret might announce his
departure on Wednesday.
	   But Megret was betting on the support of the majority of party
members. He said Wednesday that party organizations in 11 out of 22
regions supported his call for a congress.
	   Le Pen and Megret share similar ideas; their party, widely
accused of racism and anti-Semitism, is virulently opposed to
immigration and to European integration. But the men have disagreed
over how to implement their ideas.
	   One of their key disagreements was over Megret's strategy of
making electoral alliances with the mainstream right _ as the party
did in several regional elections in the spring.
	   Then in the summer, Megret opposed Le Pen's plan to put his
politically inexperienced wife, Jany, in his place at the top of
the list for European Parliament elections if his legal troubles
rendered him ineligible. Megret thought he, not Mrs. Le Pen, should
be at the top.
	   In the end, the issue was moot _ Le Pen is appealing a one-year
ban on running for office, which means the sentence is frozen for
the time being. But it put the two men on a clear collision course.

Greek central bank cuts interest rates
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout with commercial banks cutting rates &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece's central bank reduced interest
rates Wednesday, prompting similar cuts by commercial banks.
	   The Bank of Greece reduced its rate on 14-day deposits to 12.25
percent from 12.75 percent, a statement said.
	   It also plans to cut its key Lombard interest rate to 15.50
percent from 16 percent beginning Thursday. The rates, however,
remain significantly higher than in most other European Union
nations.
	   Two of Greece's major commercial banks, National Bank of Greece
and Ergobank, announced they will cut their key lending rates by up
to 3.25 percentage points beginning Monday. In the biggest drop,
the National Bank plans to cut its rate for consumer loans of up to
1 million drachmas (dlrs 3,570) to 16.75 percent from 20 percent.
	   Analysts predict other private banks will also cut rates.
	   The central bank partly attributed the rate cut to declining
inflation in Greece, where the government is struggling to meet EU
fiscal guidelines to take part in the single currency group by
2001.
	   Greek officials predict inflation should fall below 4 percent by
the end of the year. The EU-mandated target is 2 percent.

U.S. envoy ends shuttle between Ethiopia and Eritrea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ After two shuttle rounds to meet with
Ethiopia and Eritrea's leaders, U.S. envoy Anthony Lake left the
Eritrean capital Wednesday to return to Washington, D.C., the
Eritrean News Agency said.
	   Lake arrived in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa Dec. 4 on his
third visit to try to negotiate an end to a border conflict between
the formerly friendly neighbors.
	   After two weeks of heavy fighting in May and June that claimed
hundreds of lives, the conflict has simmered with sporadic
skirmishes and artillery exchanges between troops massed on both
sides of the border.
	   After meeting with Ethiopian leaders, Lake spent two days
holding meetings in Asmara and on Tuesday flew back to Addis Ababa
to hold a second meeting with Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi.
	   He returned to Asmara Tuesday evening.
	   Government and U.S. officials kept a tight lid on the contents
of the discussions.
	   But the Eritrean News Agency said Lake was expected to return to
the region for further talks.
	   An Organization of Africa Unity team led by the regional
agency's Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim is expected to arrive
in Eritrea Saturday.
	   The OAU is going to Eritrea for clarification and consultation,
before a meeting of the OAU central organ on Dec. 17 and 18, where
both countries are expected to submit responses to talking points
outlined during an OAU summit in November.
	   Ethiopia accepted the proposal, but Eritrea rejects the key
element demanding its forces withdraw from the disputed Badme area
to allow an Ethiopian administration to return.

Ukrainian opposition newspaper shut down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian authorities have shut down an
opposition newspaper, a move its editor charged Wednesday was
revenge for critical and anti-corruption materials he published.
	   Oleh Lyashko, editor-in-chief of the Politika newspaper, said he
was informed by a publishing house Tuesday that a Kiev court had
annulled the paper's registration.
	   Lyashko charged that the decision was apparently made ``in
retrospect,'' as it was dated Oct. 6 and no newspaper
representatives had been summoned to the court before the decision
became known Tuesday, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Lyashko said the court revoked Politika's registration because
the newspaper had unveiled unspecified state secrets in an article
about Ukraine's Security Service.
	   He said he was ``convinced'' that Politika was closed down over
a recent series of articles on alleged corruption in President
Leonid Kuchma's entourage.
	   ``In this case, I don't see the hand of the president. I think
it's an action by people who wish to arrange for Leonid Kuchma to
look as if he's strangling the press,'' Lyashko said.
	   Earlier this year, tax officials blocked Politika's bank
accounts and a criminal case was launched against the paper,
preventing it from being published for several months. The Kiev
arbitration court ruled against the tax authorities earlier this
month.
	   Opposition newspapers in Ukraine often allege persecution by
authorities, but government officials say the fault lies with the
newspapers, who often present faulty registration papers or publish
libelous materials.

Grenade blast kills 5 in India's Kashmir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A grenade lobbed by suspected Muslim
militants exploded at a crowded bus terminal in the northern
Jammu-Kashmir state Wednesday, killing five people and wounding 16,
a domestic news agency reported.
	   The injured were admitted to hospitals in Bandipora, 55
kilometers (34 miles) north of Srinagar, the summer capital of the
state where the explosion occurred, Press Trust of India said.
Thirteen people were in critical condition, the news agency said.
	   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the blast.
	   Nearly a dozen guerrilla groups in the frontier state of
Jammu-Kashmir are waging a nine-year-old war against Indian
security forces for independence or a merger with India's neighbor
and rival Pakistan.
	   India accuses Pakistan, with which it has fought two wars over
Kashmir, of arming and funding the insurgents. Pakistan denies the
charge.

Britain allows Spain to start extradition of Pinochet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UDPATES with Chile withdrawing ambassador from Britain &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Home Secretary Jack Straw ruled Wednesday that
Spain can start extradition proceedings against former Chilean
dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet to face charges of genocide, torture
and kidnapping.
	   In a statement, Straw said the 83-year-old general appeared fit
to stand trial and rejected complaints that a judge who ruled
against Pinochet was biased because he heads the fund-raising arm
of the human rights organization Amnesty International.
	   ``The Spanish request for his extradition will now be considered
by the courts,'' the statement said.
	   The decision means that Pinochet, under armed guard at a mansion
outside London, now faces months and possibly years of battles
through British courts fighting extradition.
	   His lawyers have said they may seek an urgent review before a
judge, arguing that Straw would be wrong on legal points to let
Spain have the general.
	   Human rights organizations were esctatic, while Pinochet's
right-wing supporters expressed outrage at this latest blow.
	   Chile withdrew its ambassador from Britain in protest, and
former Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher said Britain's
Labor Party government had made a ``grave mistake.''

Palestinian killed in clashes ahead of Clinton visit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with quotes by Ross, Netanyahu.

 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Enraged by Israel's refusal to
release security prisoners, Palestinians stoned Israeli troops
Wednesday in the most widespread West Bank clashes in months. A
17-year-old stone mason was killed by Israeli gunfire and scores of
other Palestinians were injured.
	   The violence came despite U.S. appeals for calm and raised new
concerns that U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to the region
next week is triggering unrest, rather than reassuring Israelis and
Palestinians about their troubled peace accord, as intended.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu traded accusations Wednesday and said they would
not soften positions despite intensive U.S. efforts to get the Wye
River land-for-security accord back on track.
	   Netanyahu has suspended Israel's troop withdrawal in the West
Bank and said that with the Palestinians violating ``every part of
the agreement,'' he was not likely to change his views.
	   ``If they (the Palestinians) mend their ways, we'll continue
with the agreement,'' Netanyahu said. ``If they don't, we won't.''
	   A defiant Arafat said he would not drop demands that as part of
the Wye agreement, Israel release Palestinians jailed for
anti-Israeli activities and not just common criminals. ``We tell
our heroes in the prisons we will not close our eyes until we see
them in front of our eyes,'' Arafat told cheering supporters.
	   Netanyahu has said he told Arafat from the start that Israel
would not free those involved in attacks on Israelis and accused
the Palestinian Authority of inciting against Israel to achieve
with violence what it cannot get in negotiations.
	   While Wednesday's violent protests outside most West Bank towns
appeared to have been coordinated to some degree by Arafat's Fatah
faction, the issue also touched a raw nerve in Palestinian society
and many Palestinians joined in spontaneously. Nearly every family
has had members jailed by Israel in 30 years of occupation.
	   Assaf Barghouti, 21, who was shot in the arm by Israeli troops
during clashes north of the town of Ramallah, said he took to the
streets because his father has been held for three years without
charges and his uncle has already served 21 years of a life term
for an attack in which Israelis were killed.
	   ``If Netanyahu does not release the prisoners, this will be the
situation every day,'' Barghouti said from his hospital bed,
referring to the hours-long Ramallah clashes in which hundreds of
Palestinians burned tires and pelted Israeli troops with rocks.
	   Barghouti's grandfather, Salah, 74, dressed in a long brown
robe, said he backed the rioters. ``I was out there with them,
collecting rocks and giving them to the young men,'' he said.
	   A 17-year-old stone mason, Jihad Iyad, died at Ramallah Hospital
after being shot in the chest by Israeli troops. In Jerusalem, Nasr
Erekat, a 21-year-old university student and cousin of chief
Palestinian peace negotiator Saeb Erekat, died of injuries
sustained two days earlier. Both were to be buried Thursday.
	   In all, 87 Palestinians were injured Wednesday by rubber bullets
and three by live rounds. Six Israelis, including two soldiers and
two riot policemen, were hurt by stones.
	   Hoping to calm the situation before Clinton's arrival Saturday
night, the U.S. Mideast peace coordinator, Dennis Ross, held talks
with Netanyahu and Arafat to try to settle the disputes.
	   On the prisoner issue, Ross appeared to be siding with Israel,
saying that ``the prime minister is doing what he said he would
do.'' Under the Wye accord, Israel is to release 750 prisoners by
the end of January. In a first stage, Netanyahu freed 250, most of
them criminals.
	   Ross also said he was trying to prevent a new argument over the
procedures for revoking provisions in the PLO founding charter
calling for Israel's destruction.
	   On Monday, the Palestine National Council, the Palestinians'
parliament-in-exile, is to reaffirm a decision by lesser bodies to
annul those clauses. Both Arafat and Clinton will speak to the
delegates. Netanyahu insists the PNC take a vote, but the
Palestinians say a vote is not required. Invitations to the PNC
gathering inform delegates the purpose is to hear Clinton speak.
	   Ross said he was trying to arrange a compromise.
	   ``The procedure that will be worked out will make it very clear
once and for all that the charter is nullified,'' Ross said.

Exhumations continue as murder charges pile up against doctor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HYDE, England (AP) _ Authorities exhumed a 12th body Wednesday
in the macabre investigation of a family doctor accused of killing
his female patients for their money.
	   Harold Shipman, 52, a general practitioner from the northern
England town of Hyde in greater Manchester, was charged with two
more murders this week, bringing the total to eight.
	   Detectives said he may have been responsible for as many as a
dozen more deaths of former women patients, from 1994 to June 1998.
The deaths of a total of 116 former patients are being examined.
	   Shipman was taken into custody and charged initially with four
murders after the first series of exhumations in September.
	   Details of how authorities believe Shipman killed the women have
not been disclosed.
	   Shipman appeared Tuesday in Liverpool Crown Court and pleaded
innocent to killing 81-year-old widow Kathleen Grundy, a former
Hyde mayor whose daughter sparked the investigation when she raised
concerns about her mother's death.
	   Shipman is accused of falsely obtaining cash and property worth
300,000 pounds (dlrs 500,000) from the Mrs. Grundy's estate and
forging a will and two letters.
	   The investigation by 40 detectives is expected to last 18
months.

Joy and anger mixes in Chile divided by Pinochet ruling

	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Survivors shed tears at the thought that
Chile's former dictator might be brought to justice. Officers who
served under him vowed to fight anew to secure the release of the
general who proudly ruled for 17 years.
	   Chile was divided Wednesday after Britain's decision to let
Spain start extradition proceedings against Gen. Augusto Pinochet,
who is wanted in the deaths and disappearances of more than 3,000
political opponents.
	   In London, British Home Secretary Jack Straw ruled that Spain
can begin proceedings against Pinochet, who faces charges of
genocide, torture and kidnapping.
	   Tears filled the eyes of Viviana Diaz, whose father was a
Communist leader who disappeared after being arrested by Pinochet's
security forces. She called the decision historic for the South
American country.
	   ``It is not only important for us and our loved ones, but for
all of mankind,'' said Viviana Diaz, who leads a group of the
relatives of those killed or missing. NAME???
	   She added that Britain's decision was especailly important
because it comes on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a universal
declaration of human rights.
	   ``I hope Pinochet is extradited to Spain and, finally, respond
before a court for his crimes,'' Diaz added.
	   But at the Pinochet Foundation, sorrow and anger followed the
decision. The foundation is a private organization of Pinochet
supporters, including many retired officers.
	   Foundation president Hernan Briones vowed Straw's decision would
be appealed.
	   ``This is not the end of our battle,'' he said. ``Our
sovereignty has been trampled.''
	   Chile's government did not immediately react. Officials said the
first word would come from President Eduardo Frei, on a visit to
Brazil.
	   In a communique announcing his decision, Straw said: ``I find an
authority to proceed in respect of Senator Pinochet today. The
Spanish request for his extradition will now be considered by the
courts.''
	   Chile's armed forces did not immediately comment. But Defense
Minister Jose Florencio Guzman, a civilian, said no problem should
be expected within the military.
	   Pinochet, a regular visitor to Britain, was arrested in London
Oct. 16 on a Spanish warrant seeking his extradition on charges of
genocide, kidnapping and torture during his 17-year rule. He
overthrew the elected president, Salvador Allende, in a 1973 coup.
	   Chile's leftist politicians reacted with a mixture of
satisfaction and caution.
	   ``This is good for justice and for human rights, but bad for
Chile and its stability,'' said socialist congressman Patricio
Hales.

Kuchma speaks in favor of floating hryvna rate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's President Leonid Kuchma urged the
central bank Wednesday to remove restrictions on the purchase of
dollars and introduce a floating rate for the country's hryvna
currency.
	   Kuchma said he was ``convinced ... that the limitations on
foreign currency trading should be lifted, as they always lead to
abuses.''
	   The remarks reflected Kuchma's recent support of softer monetary
policies _ including lifting currency controls and printing more
money _ to ease the government's mounting foreign and domestic debt
burden.
	   Last week, Kuchma ordered the Cabinet and the National Bank to
study the possibility of allowing the hryvna to float freely as of
Jan. 1, abandoning its present trading band, which limits the
exchange rate.
	   On Wednesday, speaking during a visit to a Kiev medicine plant,
Kuchma was more cautious and gave no precise date as to when the
floating rate might be introduced.
	   He said the government and the central bank must be ``very
careful and balanced in their calculations and see how the hard
currency behaves'' in case the hryvna is allowed to float.
	   The National Bank has worked to keep the hryvna stable since
November at about 3.4 to the U.S. dollar, within a government-set
trading band of 2.5 to 3.5 to the dollar.
	   The stabilization followed two months of financial troubles that
were caused in part by the economic crisis in neighboring Russia.
	   The National Bank has managed to temporarily stabilize the
markets over the past two months by imposing various currency
controls and limiting the dollar supply.
	   But the bank has warned repeatedly that the stability was too
fragile to permit looser monetary policies in the near future.

Slovenian parliament supports premier in intelligence affair
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) _ Opposition leader Janez Jansa failed
to get parliamentary support Wednesday to oust Premier Janez
Drnovsek after trying to hold him accountable for a secret deal
between Slovenian and Israeli intelligence services.
	   Only 24 deputies in the 90-seat parliament voted to oust
Drnovsek. An absolute majority was needed to approve the motion.
Jansa's 14 Social Democrats were joined by 10 deputies from the
opposition Christian Democrats in seeking to depose the premier.
	   Drnovsek's Social Liberals and their government coalition
partner, the People's Party, supported Drnovsek with 46 votes.
Other deputies abstained.
	   It was Jansa's second attempt to replace Drnovsek over the
affair. In May, the parliament also voted against the motion by the
former defense minister.
	   In 1995, the head of Slovenia's intelligence service signed a
secret deal with his Israeli counterpart on general cooperation.
	   According to the constitution, each legal act is to be public,
and Jansa holds Drnovsek responsible for that breach.
	   Drnovsek refused to take responsibility Wednesday. In his
defense before parliament, the prime minister said, ``I've seen no
evidence to prove my direct responsibility. One who accuses should
present proof.''
	   The move was largely seen as part of Jansa's continued attempts
to harm the standing of Drnovsek's ruling party.

Holocaust survivors meet protector with tears and flowers

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Sabina Grau Schnitzer greeted Julian Bilecki
with flowers and tears at Kennedy International Airport Tuesday,
offering thanks in Russian and Ukrainian to the man who saved her
life more than half a century ago.
	   When the two last saw each other, Bilecki was a gangly teen-ager
and Mrs. Grau Schnitzer a young girl fleeing wartime Poland with
her family. Bilecki and his family, Christians, hid 23 Jews,
including the Graus, in an underground bunker for a year during the
Holocaust.
	   Five of those survivors, New Yorkers now, waited anxiously for
him to arrive from Ukraine Tuesday on his first trip to the United
States. They hugged, kissed and cried when he stepped off the plane
with his son.
	   ``What I felt, it was very, very emotional,'' said Mrs. Grau
Schnitzer, now 65. ``I said to him in Russian and Ukrainian ...
'God should be praised for this moment, and thanks for all your
goodness.'''
	   Bilecki, 70, a retired bus driver who grew up in an area of
Poland that later became part of Ukraine, arrived for his monthlong
visit around 7 p.m. with just a gym bag and appeared overwhelmed,
said Stanlee Stahl, executive director of the Jewish Foundation for
the Righteous. The group plans to give him an award next week.
	   ``Julian walked in and he stopped and he was in shock,'' Ms.
Stahl said. ``He couldn't believe that they were all there. ...
Tears welled up into his eyes, and he looked around stunned. ...
This is his first airplane ride, first time out of his country. He
was overwhelmed.''
	   Bilecki, who does not speak English and did not want the town
where he now lives named, said he was amazed he and the survivors
had lived long enough to see each other again.
	   ``He said 'I remember you when you were young and didn't have
gray hair,''' Ms. Stahl said. ``'You have gray hair and so do I.
Look where we are now, did we ever think we could be here?'''
	   The group planned to spend the evening at the Brooklyn home of
Genia Melzer, 75, who the Nazis left for dead in a pile of corpses
after a mass shooting. She crawled out from among the bodies and
ran to the woods near the Podhajce ghetto in Poland, where Bilecki
found her covered with blood and took her in.
	   Nazis ``would have murdered (the Bileckis) on the spot if they
would have found out that they were helping us,'' Mrs. Grau
Schnitzer said. ``They had a heart, they were humanitarians, and we
want to show the world there were people like this.''
	   Bilecki's cousin, Roman, who helped Julian and his parents
protect and care for the hidden Jews, also attended the reunion. He
is now a retired mechanic living in Rochester.
	   The Bileckis hid 23 Jews who escaped from the Podhajce ghetto,
where nearly all the Jewish families from the town of Zawalow,
Poland, were killed by Nazis. The family showed the desperate Jews
where to hide, helped them move when they were almost detected and
brought food regularly.
	   ``In order not to leave traces in the snow, they would jump from
tree to tree ... in order to come to us,'' Mrs. Grau Schnitzer
said. ``They provided us with food, ... and moral support, and come
and visit us. It meant so much, it was like food for the soul.''
	   Mrs. Grau Schnitzer, then 9, left the ghetto with her parents to
bury a wagon full of dead bodies and then escaped. Her father and
uncle, who had known the Bileckis before the war, went to them for
help.
	   ``We knew that they were believers and we knew that they were
good people,'' she recalled. ``We had no choice, and we hoped that
they would not report us. ... We said 'Here we are, help us,' and
they helped us.''
	   The 23 Jews in the Bileckis' bunker went free when the Russian
army came through Poland in 1944. Many of the survivors have sent
packages of food and clothing over the years to the Bileckis, who
remained poor.
	   ``They had very hard times,'' Mrs. Grau Schnitzer said. ``The
country is poor, we tried to reciprocate in some way. ... They were
humanitarians, God-fearing people. If not for them, we wouldn't be
here today.''

category codes:
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Six years after leading a bloody coup
attempt, Hugo Chavez rode a wave of fierce public discontent to win
Venezuela's presidency by the largest margin in 40 years. The lower
classes that Chavez championed celebrated wildly in the streets
after Sunday's victory. Across the country, they honked horns, set
off fireworks and shouted ``Chavez! Chavez!'' Many donned the
winner's trademark red beret. Terrified by his fiery populist
rhetoric, Chavez's opponents had branded the cashiered lieutenant
colonel a dictator-in-waiting, poised to impose a socialist regime.
With 78 percent of the votes counted, Chavez had 56.5 percent to
39.5 percent for Salas, according to official results, and turnout
was high for Venezuela at 65 percent. (VENEZUELA-ELECTIONS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Briefly returning to work with a bang, President
Boris Yeltsin fired most of his top aides on Monday during a quick
trip to the Kremlin and assumed personal control of two key
government agencies. After just three hours at his office, Yeltsin
returned to the government hospital where he has been for the past
two weeks where he was being treated for pneumonia, a spokesman
said. The Kremlin shakeup removed several top aides who had
publicly questioned the president's health in recent weeks. Yeltsin
dismissed Chief of Staff Valentin Yumashev and his deputies Yuri
Yarov, Mikhail Komissar and Yevgeny Savostyanov. (RUSSIA-YELTSIN)
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ New satellite images providing the first
close-up views of Mars' north pole show it is a thick ice cap wider
than France but much smaller than previously thought. Planetary
scientists said Sunday that the ice cap revealed by the Mars Global
Surveyor is made of water ice. But even with Mars' very cold
climate, it is only half the size of the ice cap covering Greenland
and only 4 percent of the Antarctica's combined ice sheets. The new
three-dimensional images were discussed at the American Geophysical
Union meeting in San Francisco. The data will be published Friday
in the journal Science. (SCI-US MARS)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ In a startling turnaround, a key
witness whose allegations form the bulk of the sex charges against
Malaysia's jailed former No. 2 leader denied Monday that he was
ever sodomized by the ex-deputy prime minister. Azizan Abu Bakar,
who once worked as the driver of former deputy premier Anwar
Ibrahim's wife, now says Anwar did not force him into sodomy, a
crime in this predominantly Muslim nation. Anwar is currently on
trial for four counts of abuse of power. He will be tried later on
another charge of corruption and five charges of committing illegal
sex acts. He has denied any wrongdoing, calling the charges part of
a high-level conspiracy to ruin his political career.
(MALAYSIA-ANWAR TRIAL)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Speeding up a campaign to stamp out a would-be
political opposition party, Chinese authorities will put one of its
leading organizers on trial next week for subversion, a rights
group reported Monday. Court officials in Hangzhou city gave Wang
Youcai's wife an indictment Monday identifying him as a ringleader
of the China Democracy Party and outlining five charges he will
face at trial Dec. 17, the Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China reported. The principle charge accuses
Wang of linking up with overseas forces to ``incite the overthrow
of state power'' and is punishable by 10 years to life in prison,
the Hong Kong-based Information Center said. (CHINA-DISSIDENTS)

 &UR; Spanish man surrenders for lynching son's killer &LR; 
	   MADRID (Reuters) _ A man turned himself in to police in the
eastern city of Valencia after the lynching of a truck driver who
had run over and killed the man's 22-month-old son, officials
said.
	   Jose Munoz surrendered Sunday afternoon just as his son was
being buried. He was detained by police, who said they were still
investigating the case. Munoz is suspected of leading the group of
people that stabbed and beat to death 44-year old Antonio Civantos
_ the truck driver who ran over Munoz's son Friday evening.
	   When Civantos got out of his truck after hitting the boy he was
set upon by a group who attacked him with fists, knives and a club,
local media reported. Police said at least three people were
involved in the killing while others prevented Civantos from
fleeing the scene, El Pais newspaper reported.

 &UR; French sculptor Cesar dead at 77 &LR; 
	   PARIS (Reuters) _ French sculptor Cesar, best known for crushing
car wrecks into cubes, has died, radio and television said Monday.
He was 77.
	   Cesar, whose full name was Cesar Baldaccini, worked scrap metal
with a blowtorch to produce extravagant scupltures. A controversial
artist, he built a 500-tonne wall of piled up cars for the Venice
film festival in 1995, and a 12-metre-tall thumb standing in Paris'
La Defense business district.
	   Cesar was born in Marseille in 1921, the son of Italian
immigrants.

 &UR; At least 10 die in two Paris fires &LR; 
	   PARIS (Reuters) _ Seven people died in a fire at an old people's
home near Paris early Monday, firemen said. They said more than 30
people were injured in the blaze, which apparently started in a
bedroom.
	   Firemen were still searching for more possible casualties in the
ruins of the home, in the northern suburb of Livry-Gargan.
	   Another blaze in a five-storey apartment block in central Paris
took three lives, firemen said. One of the victims fell to her
death after jumping out of a window onto a parked car to escape the
blaze.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Ukrainian authorities cut off Russian fleet's telephones &LR; 
	   SEVASTOPOL, Ukraine (AP) _ A Ukrainian telephone company shut
off lines to Russia's Black Sea fleet because of unpaid bills,
fleet officials said Monday.
	   The state-owned Ukrtelecom company said the fleet owed more than
$223,000 Cdn in unpaid telephone bills, and have cut lines for the
fleet commander's deputies, top aides and senior staff, reported
the UNIAN news agency.
	   Russia rents naval bases in Sevastopol, a predominately ethnic
Russian city on the Crimean Peninsula, under a 1996 agreement
dividing the former Soviet fleet. The city's status _ which Russian
nationalists argue should belong to Russia _ has soured relations
between the two countries since the 1991 Soviet collapse.

 &UR; Ten horses befriended, then stabbed; two die &LR; 
	   BARLING, Ark. (AP) _ Authorities put ranchers in western
Arkansas on alert after two horses were stabbed to death and eight
others were wounded during the weekend.
	   Some of the horses were befriended in fields and others were
lured with food to the front of their barn stalls before being
attacked, said Barling police officer Larry Croom. Two of his
horses were wounded _ just over two weeks after another of his
horses was stabbed to death in a pasture.
	   The attacks occurred at three farms Saturday, all along the same
half-kilometre of a rural road. All but one of the horses were
stabbed in the neck or head, he said. ``It's very impersonal to
drive by and shoot a horse,'' police spokeswoman Victoria Harris
said. ``But it's another thing to be nice, befriend the horse and
then stab it to death. Anyone who can look into the soft, brown
eyes of a horse and then stab it has the profile of a serial
killer.''

 &UR; At least 10 killed in fighting in southern Somali port town &LR; 
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ At least 10 people were killed and
more than 15 wounded in clashes between rival militiamen in a
southern Somali port, reports from the town said Monday.
	   Fighting between rival factions of the Habar Gidir clan erupted
Sunday in Merca, about 100 km south of the capital Mogadishu,
forcing markets to close, according to witnesses contacted by VHF
radio.
	   Three people were killed and five wounded during an early
exchange between the rival Eyr and Sa'ad factions, which control
different parts of Merca, witnesses said. Later in the evening,
fighting intensified around the hospital, where a prominent
militiaman was being treated for wounds suffered earlier in the
day. Another seven people, including at least one woman bystander,
were killed, the reports said. Ten others were wounded.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Second World War bomb explodes, killing four Filipinos &LR; 
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A Second World War-vintage bomb dug
up from under a house exploded Monday, killing the owner of the
house and three others, Filipino police said.
	   Police said carpenters were installing a septic tank 15 days ago
when they found a bomb under a house in Tacloban, 580 km southeast
of the capital, Manila, but it was not reported to authorities.
	   The homeowner called three friends to help him open the bomb,
hoping to sell the gunpowder inside, a police investigator said.
The 450-kilogram bomb went off as they were tinkering with it,
instantly killing the four and destroying the house.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; UK doctor faces murder trial, 10th body exhumed &LR; 
	   MANCHESTER, England (Reuters) _ A British family doctor, charged
with murdering eight of his female patients, appeared in court
Monday as police exhumed the body of a 10th woman.
	   Harold Shipman, 52, was ordered to stand trial for the murders
of three of the women and court hearings regarding the deaths of
another five were scheduled for later this month and in January.
Investigations are continuing and the number of formal charges are
expected to rise.
	   Shipman, who ran a doctor's practice in the quiet village of
Hyde near the north-west city of Manchester, was first accused of
killing former patient Kathleen Grundy and forging her will to make
himself the sole beneficiary of her 300,000 pounds ($761,000 Cdn)
estate. He has denied all the charges against him.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Microsoft chairman Bill Gates portrayed
himself Monday as the victim of overzealous lawyers who don't
understand the ``incredibly fierce'' competition of the nation's
high-tech industry.
	   Citing last month's $4.2 billion purchase of Netscape
Communications Corp. by America Online Inc., Gates called it ``hard
to believe the government can continue to make its case with a
straight face.''
	   In a high-profile defection from the government's case, South
Carolina announced Monday it was ending its involvement in the
trial, leaving 19 states and the Justice Department to pursue
Microsoft. South Carolina Attorney General Charlie Condon, a
Republican, also cited the AOL-Netscape agreement as evidence that
``further government intervention or regulation is unnecessary and,
in my judgment, unwise.''

	   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) _ ScottishPower's $7.9 billion bid to buy
U.S. electric company PacifiCorp would be the first foreign
takeover of an American utility, if it makes it through a
regulatory maze that includes a law limiting overseas ownership of
utilities.
	   The deal announced Monday would create a company with 7 million
customers in Britain and the United States and 23,500 employees,
making it by some measures one of the world's top 10 utilities.
	   ``This is a strong partnership in a strong part of the U.S. with
opportunities to grow and expand,'' Alan Richardson,
ScottishPower's director of power systems, said at a news
conference here.

	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ Eli Lilly and Co. bought the rights to a new
and improved version of the depression drug Prozac on Monday in a
deal that could hurt generic companies waiting to roll out cheaper
copies of the drug.
	   Lilly will pay $90 million plus sales royalties to Sepracor
Inc., a small Massachusetts company that developed a modified form
of Prozac which promises a more effective treatment for depression,
possibly without some of the troubling side effects such as sexual
dysfunction.
	   The deal might allow Lilly to retain its lucrative franchise on
Prozac even if generic versions hit the market when the drug's main
patent expires in 2003. Lilly could move doctors from prescribing
the old Prozac to the new Prozac, and keep its price stable,
analysts said.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Consumers would get more choices for
high-speed Internet access if local phone companies were freed from
federal regulations, a new alliance of big telephone and computer
companies said Monday.
	   BellSouth, Bell Atlantic, SBC Communications, US West and GTE
have been pressing the Federal Communications Commission to ease
some regulations that they say discourage them from modernizing
their networks. Now, Compaq Computer, Gateway, Intel and Microsoft
are backing those efforts with the FCC.
	   But rivals, including AT&AMP;T, MCI WorldCom and Sprint, assailed
the plan, saying it would violate the law and blunt competition.
AT&AMP;T called it ``yet another backdoor attempt by the Bell companies
and GTE to undermine the very clear provisions of the Telecom
Act.''

	   LONDON (AP) _ Sema, a relatively obscure European computer
company, on Monday beat out several leading technology firms to
replace IBM as the Olympics' chief technology sponsor, starting in
2001.
	   International Business Machines Corp., the world's largest
computer company, said last August it would end its 38-year
partnership with the International Olympic Committee at the 2000
Sydney Games.
	   Olympics organizers on Monday described the eight-year deal with
Sema, a French-English company, as the biggest sports-related
information technology contract ever awarded. While figures weren't
disclosed, the deal was believed to be worth about $220 million.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The ruble flirted with a new low Monday as the
arrival of a World Bank team for more loan talks did little to
assuage fears that Russia will be left without foreign aid.
	   The ruble rate has been the main indicator of economic
confidence since Russian financial markets were virtually wiped out
in August, and its fall reflected fears that Russia will begin
printing large sums of money to pay off its debts and cover the
budget deficit.
	   Substantial money-printing is certain to trigger high inflation.
Russia printed 3.5 billion rubles ($172 million) in October, and 10
billion rubles ($490 million) in November to cover the deficit,
Central Bank deputy head Tatyana Paramonova said Monday, according
to the Interfax news agency.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The resilient economy fueled a surprising 7.1
percent rise in U.S. advertising spending this year, according to
the industry's best-known forecaster.
	   But growth in ad spending is expected to slow in 1999 as
economic growth cools, Robert Coen, senior vice president of the
McCann-Erickson Worldwide ad agency, said Monday. Next year's ad
spending will also suffer by comparison because of this year's
boost from the Winter Olympics and midterm elections.
	   Advertisers spent a projected $200.83 billion in the United
States in 1998, up from $187.52 billion in 1997, Coen said in his
annual address, which led off the PaineWebber media conference.
	    &UR; ___
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Faced with sagging sales and profits, Liz
Claiborne Inc. will eliminate about 400 jobs, close 30 retail
stores and try to improve its ailing business at department stores.
	   The women's clothing manufacturer said Monday the restructuring
will cost $13 million to $17 million and reduce its fourth-quarter
earnings by 20 cents to 26 cents a share. But the New York-based
company expects the cutbacks to boost its profits in the future by
lowering costs and improving its productivity.
	   Wall Street, which has sold off Liz Claiborne stock in recent
months, cheered the news. The company's stock rose $1.31\ to
$32.12{ in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
	    &UR; ___
	   SOUTHFIELD, Mich. (AP) _ Automotive supplier Lear Corp. said
Monday it will cut 2,800 jobs, or about 4 percent of its work
force, and close 18 plants as part of a previously announced plan
to cut costs.
	   About 1,100 of the jobs will be cut in North America, the rest
in Europe. Two of the plants to be closed are in North America, 15
in Europe and one in South America. Spokeswoman Karen Stewart would
not say which plants are affected. She said those details would be
given directly to employees.
	   Lear has been on a buying spree for the past few years, adding
more than 200 plants. This year, it bought the car seat business of
General Motors Corp.'s Delphi parts division, and parts companies
in Italy and Great Britain. It also announced plans to expand
production in Portugal and Russia. But since then, analysts said,
the company was not been able to meet its price targets.
	    &UR; ___
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Wall Street and the nation's bankers are
pushing the idea of personal investment accounts as the core of a
revamped Social Security system, a stand that puts them at odds
with several big civil rights groups.
	   The investment industry and banks issued statements Monday as
lawmakers prepared to offer detailed proposals to a White House
conference for changing the nation's retirement system. The
proposals revolve around privatization, investing in volatile but
potentially more lucrative securities such as stocks.
	   But the Rev. Jesse Jackson, part of the coalition of traditional
civil rights groups resisting the change, said: ``Privatization is
pro-market but it is anti-security, anti-worker and anti-family.''
	    &UR; ___
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 
	   Stocks advanced strongly Monday as Microsoft and a growing array
of hot Internet companies rocketed the Nasdaq to a new record high.
The Dow Jones industrial average rallied for a second consecutive
session, rising 54.33 to 9,070.47, putting a dent in last week's
316.94 drop.
	   The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 37.48 to close
at 2,040.64, eclipsing the record of 2,016.44 set Nov. 27. The
Nasdaq is now up 30 percent for the year, a return twice as high as
the Dow.
	   Natural gas, crude oil and its byproducts futures prices rose
sharply as pork futures prices slumped.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Facing Republican House Judiciary Committee
members who won't change their minds, President Bill Clinton's
legal team is mounting a vigorous impeachment defense aimed at
undecided Republican lawmakers who will decide Clinton's fate. The
21 Republicans on the 37-member committee have made clear that,
barring any new evidence favorable to Clinton, they would vote for
at least one article of impeachment this week. The expert White
House witnesses will argue that Clinton did not commit impeachable
conduct by trying to hide a sexual affair; that impeachment for
such concealment would set a dangerous precedent for attacking
future presidents, and that the Lewinsky matter is far less grave
than President Richard Nixon's official abuse of power in
Watergate. (US-CLINTON-IMPEACHMENT)
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ At least nine U.N. vans went into the field
in Iraq on Tuesday, the day chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard
Butler said a series of surprise visits would begin. Caroline
Cross, the inspectors' spokeswoman in Baghdad, did not characterize
the inspections as ``surprise,'' describing them instead as ``their
usual hard work.'' U.N. officials in Baghdad have been reticent
since work resumed Nov. 18 after the latest crisis with Iraq. The
Baghdad regime in August and October halted the work of the U.N.
Special Commission, which oversees the inspections. UNSCOM must
certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction
before punishing U.N. trade sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait, can be lifted. (UN-IRAQ)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ New clashes erupted Tuesday in the West Bank as
domestic pressure mounted on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to
abandon the Wye River land-for-security agreement with the
Palestinians. The renewed violence and Israel's political turmoil
came just days before U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to Israel
and the Palestinian areas next week. The trip was intended to shore
up the Wye agreement and restore calm to the region, but appeared
to be having the opposite effect. In the West Bank town of Ram just
north of Jerusalem, dozens of Palestinian students hurled stones at
Israeli soldiers who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets.
Four students were injured. Outside Netanyahu's office, dozens of
Jewish settlers staged a protest after assailants believed to be
Palestinian militants opened fire and wounded a West Bank settler
late Monday. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIAN)
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechen authorities found the decapitated
remains of four kidnapped foreigners Tuesday near a remote village
after a two-month search in the breakaway region in southern
Russia. An Associated Press reporter saw four severed heads near
the village of Assinovskaya, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of
Grozny, the Chechen capital. The heads were identified as those of
the four abducted foreigners by a bodyguard assigned to the four
when they were abducted Oct. 3 by unidentified gunmen in Grozny.
The hostages _ three Britons and a New Zealander _ were engineers.
They were working for Granger Telecom, a British telephone company,
installing 300,000 telephone lines across Chechnya.
(RUSSIA-YELTSIN)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The first report on human rights
in Malaysia ever compiled by a local group was released Tuesday,
and it painted a dismal picture of political oppression and police
violence in the Southeast Asian nation. The 258-page report
described Malaysia as a ``severely restricted democracy'' where an
armory of laws provides for ``detention without trial and
restrictions over basic freedoms.'' The report by the country's
main human rights group, SUARAM or Voice of Malaysian Peoples,
comes at a time when world attention is focused on Malaysia because
of the highly politicized trial of former deputy prime minister
Anwar Ibrahim. (MALAYSIA-HUMAN RIGHTS)

Amsterdam court outlaws claims that famed diary was forged
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ An Amsterdam court on Wednesday
outlawed claims that Anne Frank's famed diary was a forgery written
by her father after World War II.
	   The decision was hailed as a landmark legal victory by the Anne
Frank Foundation, which is headquartered in the Amsterdam canal
house-turned-museum where the young Jewish diarist and her family
hid from the Nazis.
	   ``It is a very important step,'' said the foundation's executive
director, Hans Westra.
	   Amsterdam District Court ruled that anyone found guilty of
denying the diary's authenticity can be fined 25,000 guilders (dlrs
13,000).
	   The ruling was based on the foundation's complaint against a
revisionist book by French author Robert Faurisson titled ``Anne
Frank, a Critical Approach,'' which describes the diary as a fake
created by Anne's father, Otto Frank.
	   The book was published by a group run by Belgian extreme
right-wing figure Siegfried Verbeke.
	   ``Today we have a very principled ruling from the Dutch court
that the diary is authentic and that it is forbidden to abuse Mr.
Frank,'' Westra said.
	   At a hearing in August, Verbeke said he would no longer
distribute or publish the book, but added that it was already
available on the Internet.
	   Neither Verbeke nor Faurisson, a former literature professor who
is well known in France for his Holocaust denials, were present in
court Wednesday for the ruling.
	   Westra conceded that cyberspace is a fertile ground for
revisionist ideas, and said the Anne Frank Foundation was
investigating whether measures could be taken to eradicate such
publications from the Internet.
	   ``The Diary of Anne Frank'' documents the difficulties she and
her family endured while hiding from the Nazis in a secret annex
hidden by a moveable bookcase from July 1942 until they were
captured in the fall of 1944.
	   Frank died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen camp just weeks before
it was liberated in the spring of 1945, and her diary was published
posthumously. It has become an international bestseller, translated
into more than 50 languages.

Lower house adopts controversial bill on umarried couples
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French lawmakers on Wednesday adopted a
controversial bill that would give legal status to unmarried
couples, but the measure could still be tripped up and is unlikely
to become law before mid-1999.
	   The so-called Civil Solidarity Pact, or PACS, was adopted in a
first reading 316-249, with the opposition right voting against the
bill that it has called a carte blanche for homosexual marriages.
	   The bill next goes to the Senate _ probably in March. Then it
must be taken up by the Constitutional Council.
	   This was the second attempt at passage in the lower house of
parliament. Rightist politicians finally stopped their delaying
tactics on Tuesday.
	   The bill, which has been laden with hundreds of amendments,
would allow two unrelated people to form a union that would, among
other things, allow them to file joint tax returns, gain
inheritance benefits, and share social security coverage.

Armenian gas service officials arrested after explosion

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ Two gas agency officials have been
charged in an explosion in a children's sanitarium in Armenia that
killed 12 people, officials said Wednesday.
	   Last week's blast in a cafeteria at the Dzhermuk resort was
caused by a defective gas pipe that had not been tested before use,
said Gurgen Ambarian, spokesman for Armenia's Prosecutor's Office.
	   Gas leaked through badly welded seams in the pipe, accumulated
in the cafeteria basement and eventually exploded, Ambarian said.
	   The regional gas service chief Knyaz Movsesian and his deputy
Karapet Yegoyan were arrested Tuesday and charged with abuse of
office that caused ``heavy consequences.''
	   If convicted, they could face 2 to 8 years in prison.
	   The children's sanitarium in Dzhermuk _ a well-known mineral
water resort 150 kilometers (90 miles) southeast of Armenia's
capital, Yerevan _ housed children accompanied by their mothers.
	   Thirteen people were also injured in the explosion.

Spain silent over British decision on Pinochet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Britain-Pinochet, Chile-Pinochet &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Britain's decision to let Spain continue
extradition proceedings against Gen. Augusto Pinochet met with a
stony silence from the Spanish government Wednesday.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's office and the foreign
ministry both said they had no comment on the announcement by Home
Secretary Jack Straw in London.
	   Aznar's government has made clear it does not support Judge
Baltasar Garzon's efforts to put the former Chilean dictator on
trial in Spain on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture.
	   Since Pinochet was arrested in London on Oct. 16 on a warrant
from Garzon, Aznar has repeated that neither he nor his government
would interfere in the case, which was for the courts to decide.
	   The Aznar government has said that eight years after Pinochet
stepped down, Chile still has delicate political dynamics because
of deep divisions between supporters and critics of Pinochet, now
83.
	   Spain also has lucrative trade ties and major investments in
Chile, and Aznar is seen as eager to protect them.
	   However, the government, sticking to its official position,
reluctantly passed on Garzon's formal extradition request on Nov.
5.
	   Meanwhile human rights groups welcomed Straw's decision, which
sets the stage for months of legal wrangling in Britain as Pinochet
fights extradition.
	   ``We believe it is a coherent decision,'' said Francisco Perez,
a human rights activist who works for United Left, a political
party that had filed suit three years ago asking Judge Garzon to
charge Pinochet.
	   ``We think it is the best possible news on the 50th anniversary
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,'' Perez said.
	   ``Human rights cannot be just a matter of idle talk. The British
government and Judge Garzon are showing that one can fight against
impunity.''
	   Carlos Iriart, head of the Movement against Impunity, a key
anti-Pinochet group in Spain, said, ``we are not used to receiving
good news.''
	   Of Straw's decision, he added: ``It represents a new orientation
in international law that ends the impunity of those who have
committed human rights. Today we can say that a new era has
begun.''

Hezbollah attacks Israelis after sonic booms panic residents

 &UR; Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with Hezbollah attacks on Israeli
outposts &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Hezbollah guerrillas fired mortars and
rockets on Israeli-held outposts Wednesday after Israeli warplanes
flew over Beirut, breaking the sound barrier to produce two booms
that panicked residents.
	   There were no casualties from the Hezbollah offensive on the
outposts of Israeli troops and their allied South Lebanon Army
militia, Lebanese security official said. They spoke on condition
of anonymity.
	   In a statement the Iranian-backed Hezbollah said it scored
``direct hits'' on the outposts in the Israeli-occupied border
enclave in South Lebanon. It did not elaborate.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Israeli jets and helicopters conducted mock
bombing runs over southern Lebanon, drawing anti-aircraft fire.
	   The Hezbollah and other guerrillas are fighting to oust 1,500
Israeli troops and 2,500 SLA militiamen from the occupied enclave
that Israel created in 1985 as a buffer against attacks on its
northern territory.
	   In Beirut, rush-hour traffic came to a momentary standstill in
some places when two Israeli planes flew low over the city at 9:10
a.m. (0710 GMT) at speeds of more than 1,200 kilometers per hour
(750 miles per hour).
	   The supersonic booms of the jets rattled windows of apartment
buildings. Some people said they were knocked off their chairs.
Others jumped from their beds thinking that bombs were falling.
	   Anti-aircraft guns fired at the jets from Naameh, a coastal
village 16 kilometers (10 miles) south of Beirut, security
officials said.
	   Israeli planes flew over the city again about two hours later,
but broke no sound barriers.
	   Prime Minister-designate Salim Hoss denounced the Israeli
flights as ``aggressive and provocative.''
	   ``We uphold our attitude toward liberating our territory from
the Israeli occupation,'' Hoss said in a statement broadcast by
state-run Beirut Radio.
	   Israeli jets frequently make high-altitude flights and break the
sound barrier over Beirut. But Wednesday's flights were the lowest
in years and reminded people of the Israeli invasion of 1982 when
the city came under severe bombardment.

'Alternative Nobel' recipients urge action
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Winners of this year's Right Livelihood
awards, the ''alternative Nobels,'' on Wednesday extolled the
effectiveness of individuals standing up against seeming monoliths
such as hatred and corporate exploitation.
	   ''Through not raising one's voice , this contributes to standing
up for and supporting a world in which too many people are killed.
While saying a loud 'no!' might at times look quite powerless, it
is still immensely more powerful than silence,'' Croatian peace
activist Vesna Terselic said in remarks prepared for delivery at
the awards ceremony.
	   Terselic and Katarina Kruhonja, another Croatian working for
post-war reconciliation, share one of this year's four awards. The
others went to cancer-prevention specialist Samuel Epstein, the
International Baby Food Action Network, and Juan Pablo Orrego, who
leads a campaign to prevent the damming of Chile's Bio Bio River.
	   The awards, each worth 450,000 kronor (dlrs 56,250), were
founded in 1980 by Jakob von Uexkull, a stamp dealer who sold his
collection to fund a program to recognize work that he believes
gets short shrift from the Nobel prizes.
	   ''In any rational society, their work would long ago have been
crowned with success ... but their struggles still go on,'' von
Uexkull said Wednesday.
	   The awards are presented in the Swedish Parliament, reflecting
the prestige the program has acquired.
	   Orrego, in his prepared remarks, made a call for two sorts of
action: working against ''the destructive pattern of growth of
urban-industrial societies,'' and undertaking the rigors of
spiritual exploration.
	   ''We need humility and a sort of rooted cosmic consciousness,
which is hard to find today,'' he said. ``We need to start by
including the non-huan in the 'us','' to understand the importance
of ecological concerns.
	   Ira Puspadewi of Indonesia, representing IBFAN, spoke of the
difficulty of encouraging breast-feeding in the face of infant
formula companies that have ''used every form of advertising
gimmick ... to persuade mothers, parents and health workers that
bottle-feeding is as good as or better than 'old-fashioned'
breast-feeding.''
	   Epstein, founder of the U.S. Cancer Prevention Coalition, was
critical both of companies that market carcinogenic chemicals, but
also of legal systems that don't punish the companies and of the
conventional anti-cancer strategies that focus on diagnosis and
treatment rather than on prevention.
	   ''I have reached the conclusion that the cancer establishment
bears a heavy burden of responsibility for losing the winnable war
against cancer,'' said Epstein, who is also director of the school
of public health at the University of Illinois-Chicago.
	   ''There is an overwhelming disparity between the full force of
criminal law and punishment directed at perpetrators of theft,
property damage or personal violence and the lenient civil
proceedings against ... industries that knowingly manipulate,
suppress or distort information on the ... hazards of their
processes,'' he said.

Ukrainian president to visit Belarus

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma will
travel to neighboring Belarus this weekend for an official visit to
focus on economic ties, his spokesman said Wednesday.
	   Kuchma is to meet with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko
and Prime Minister Sergei Ling for talks on ways to improve
economic links and business contacts and boost trade turnover
between the two former Soviet republics, said the spokesman,
Oleksandr Martynenko.
	   ``The decline in our mutual trade turnover is simply shameful
for us,'' Kuchma said Wednesday, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   The trade turnover fell by 16 percent this year following the
economic crisis in Russia, which has severely affected the
economies of Ukraine and Belarus. Russia remains the principal
trade partner of both nations.
	   The crisis and its economic and political consequences for
Russia and the neighboring states will feature prominently in the
talks, Kuchma said.
	   But the main task is to revive trade, he said.
	   ``We should make all our officials sit together and think how to
develop trade and economic ties,'' Kuchma added. ``In the present
complex economic situation, it is just senseless to wait for the
mechanisms to start working effectively by themselves.''
	   In Belarus, officials said the sides are expected to sign a
long-term economic cooperation agreement and approve a 10-year
cooperation plan, the UNIAN news agency reported.
	   During the visit Friday and Saturday, Kuchma also plans to
discuss exchanging Ukrainian flour for Belarusian-made tractors,
and to travel to the city of Brest for a meeting of officials and
businessmen in the border regions of the two countries.

formally proposed an emergency food aid package to Russia worth
nearly a half-billion dollars.
	   The dlrs 460 milliion aid proposal by the Commission, the
European Union's executive branch, must now be approved by the 15
EU member-nations and the European Parliament.
	   EU leaders are expected to discuss the aid at their two-day
summit starting Friday in Vienna, Austria, as part of a wider
debate on relations with Russia.
	   EU foreign ministers who agreed to back the package earlier this
week had insisted on tight controls to ensure the aid reaches the
needy _ not profiteers.
	   The ministers said they wanted independent monitoring of the
distribution of the aid, which includes hundreds of millions of
tons of grain, beef, milk powder and other basic foods. They also
demanded monthly reports from the Russian authorities.
	   In making its proposal, the EU Commission warned the risk of
abuse could not be ruled out despite the controls.
	   The Commission reiterated the case for the aid, saying nearly
half of Russia's 89 regions will have grain shortages this winter.
That is twice as high as a Commission estimate in mid-November.
	   The food aid will be sold in Russia at market prices, and
profits used to fund social projects.
	   The EU has been debating Russian aid since Nov. 9, four days
after the United States announced a dlrs 600 million food aid
package for Russia.
	   Russia's worst grain harvest in 40 years, coming on the heels of
the summer's financial collapse, has sent prices rising 50 percent
and prompted fears the poor won't be able to afford food throughout
the winter.

Yeltsin retreats to country residence after leaving hospital
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin retreated to a wooded
country home Wednesday after being released from a hospital, and it
appeared he would remain in hibernation despite the country's
pressing problems.
	   Yeltsin has not been a full-time president for months, and he
almost completely disappeared from public view for more than two
weeks in the Central Clinical Hospital, where he was treated for
pneumonia.
	   Yeltsin, 67, insists that he has no serious health problems, but
after so many illnesses in recent years _ including heart bypass
surgery in 1996, few believe he can maintain a normal working
schedule.
	   ``Doctors are generally satisfied with the president's
condition,'' Yeltsin's spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said after the
president was discharged.
	   But, he added, Yeltsin will receive periodic checkups at the
hospital and needs a ``convalescence period'' at his country home,
Rus, about 60 miles north of Moscow.
	   Yeltsin did not have any meetings Wednesday and there was no
word on when he might return to the Kremlin.
	   The president's latest illness clearly demonstrated that he is
not involved in the day-to-day running of the government, though he
remains extremely sensitive to any suggestions that he's a lame
duck, or that he won't serve out his term until the year 2000.
	   The president's only major announcement during his illness came
Monday, when he visited the Kremlin for three hours to dismiss
several top aides, some of whom had dared to comment on the
president's health problems. Yeltsin returned to his sickbed
immediately afterward.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who is dealing with the
country's economic turmoil, said Yeltsin can ``perfectly perform''
his duties and will ``work until the end of his term.'' His remarks
were published Wednesday in the Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper.
	   Primakov has handled many presidential duties in recent months,
and he gathered his top ministers Wednesday to work out next year's
austerity budget.
	   Yeltsin, meanwhile, has said almost nothing about Russia's
latest economic crisis, which hit four months ago, partly in
response to Asia's economic travails.
	   Russia in the 1990s has suffered one of the worst depressions
ever experienced by an industrial nation, and Yeltsin has given up
the pretense of suggesting solutions to the country's entrenched
problems.
	   Primakov said in Wednesday's interview that the government was
``not abandoning (economic) reforms, but the influence of the state
must be increased.''
	   He acknowledged that the currency was likely to continue
falling, and inflation, which will hit about 70 percent this year,
would probably keep rising.
	   ``We are doing our best to halt this slide (of the ruble) and
scale back inflation,'' he said.

Russia's nuclear chief hails deal with Iran
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Dismissing U.S. concerns, Russia's top nuclear
official said Wednesday that Moscow would go ahead with a project
to build a nuclear reactor in Iran, but won't hand over weapons
technology.
	   Russia signed an $800 million deal with Iran in 1995 to help
build a 1,000-megawatt light-water reactor at the country's Bushehr
power plant. Last month, Iranian officials asked Moscow to conduct
a feasibility study for building another three reactors at the same
site.
	   The United States and Israel have condemned the project, saying
it might help Iran obtain technology needed to develop nuclear
weapons.
	   Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov on Wednesday sought to
reassure Washington, but insisted Russia would go ahead with the
project, which he said was only for peaceful purposes and would
earn the country's nuclear program much-needed cash.
	   ``Naturally, we will not forget about our international
obligations in the field of nuclear nonproliferation,'' Adamov
said. ``Iran is our neighbor, and the appearance of nuclear weapons
there is far more dangerous to us than to the United States across
the ocean.''
	   The Russian government has acknowledged that Iran has tried to
acquire technology to build weapons of mass destruction, but
insists it has foiled all such efforts.
	   The New York Times reported Tuesday that Iran had recruited five
Russian scientists who worked on Russia's germ warfare program, and
was trying to lure more from research centers in Russia and
Kazakstan.
	   Russia's Foreign Ministry and the Iranian Embassy in Moscow both
declined to comment on the report.
	   Vladimir Orlov, the head of an independent Russian think-tank
that studies Iran's weapons programs, said he couldn't confirm the
report. But he said Russia has been lax in preventing the export of
weapons technology.
	   ``The government's action in the field has been clearly
inadequate,'' said Orlov, head of the PIR-Center for Policy
Studies. ``The facilities mentioned in the report have failed to
receive sufficient financing and protection by the state.''
	   Adamov lashed out Wednesday at the United States for what he
called its biased and politicized approach to the nuclear reactor
project.
	   ``This is purely a business deal that we carry out with extreme
precision, bearing in mind its political sensitivity,'' Adamov
said. ``Since Soviet times, our greatest potential has been in the
space, aviation and nuclear fields, and now the nation should earn
money using its intellectual and industrial potential.''
	   Adamov said he took Russian nuclear specialists to Iran last
month to discuss training Iranian nuclear scientists. Russia was
ready to provide extensive training, but Adamov declined to comment
on the details, saying they were still being finalized.
	   The Iranian project and similar deals with China and India will
generate more money for Russia's cash-strapped nuclear industry
than aid programs can provide, Adamov said.
	   The United States has been providing aid to Russian scientists
in hopes they will not be tempted to sell their expertise to
countries that want to develop nuclear arms and weapons of mass
destruction.
	   The U.S. Energy Department recently announced a plan aimed at
creating new jobs at Russia's 10 nuclear research centers.

U.N. team withdraws when refused entry to Baath Party office

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In a new challenge to the U.N. search for
illegal weapons in Iraq, a team of inspectors was turned back
Wednesday when it tried to enter a major office of the ruling Baath
Party, a key site of Saddam Hussein's government.
	   The incident _ which has the potential to blow into another
crisis _ came two days after Butler announced that he was ordering
the resumption of the so-called surprise inspections. On Tuesday,
the inspectors visited 32 sites and on Wednesday, 10 more.
	   Richard Butler, head of the U.N. Special Commission, which
oversees inspections, called the Iraqi action ``a blockage.''
	   ``This was an absolutely legal no-notice inspection and they
blocked us,'' he told The Associated Press in New York.
	   The inspectors withdrew after an Iraqi official demanded that
they first provide a written declaration ``on the material and
items'' they sought, the official Iraqi News Agency said.
	   Butler said the Iraqi demand for a written notice is ``simply
wrong'' and ``nonsense.''
	   Iraq, which had suspended the inspections in August, allowed
them to resume only last month, averting a military strike by the
United States and Britain. The two countries have left an armada in
the Gulf to ensure Iraq abides by its promise to cooperate with the
inspectors of the United Nations Special Commission.
	   But Wednesday's dispute elicited a cautious reaction from the
United States. David Leavy, a spokesman for the National Security
Council, said the administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton
awaits a report by Butler next week on Iraq's overall compliance
with U.N. requirements.
	   ``As the president has said, if UNSCOM cannot do its job
effectively, we remain poised to act,'' Leavy said. He declined to
say what would trigger U.S. military action.
	   UNSCOM must certify that Iraq has eliminated its chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons as well as long-range missiles
before U.N. economic sanctions can be lifted.
	   The sanctions were imposed after the 1990 Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait, and Iraqi officials have long insisted they have eliminated
all illegal weapons.
	   Wednesday's disagreement was played out outside one of the four
branches of Baath Party headquarters in Baghdad. The exact location
of the Baghdad office was not immediately known.
	   A U.N. inspection team tried to get into the building Wednesday
morning ``in a surprising and provocative manner,'' INA said,
quoting Gen. Hossam Mohammed Amin, who heads an office that liaises
with the inspectors.
	   He complained that the team was seeking a confrontation.
	   ``The practices of the inspectors ... have the clear goal of
creating crises and problems,'' Amin said.
	   Ewen Buchanan, the inspectors' spokesman in New York, said this
round of inspections, which were scheduled to end Monday, would
continue. He did not know whether inspectors would try to enter the
site again.
	   As many as 140 inspectors on regular teams are working in Iraq
as well as some visiting experts, Caroline Cross, a U.N.
spokeswoman in Baghdad, said earlier. She would not give the exact
number involved but said it was ``a little less than 200,'' or the
entire contingent.
	   The Iraqi News Agency quoted Amin later as saying seven teams
visited 10 sites on Wednesday. Inspectors used helicopters in one
of the searches outside Baghdad, he said.
	   A team from the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is
responsible for inspections of Iraq's nuclear programs, also
arrived in Baghdad on Wednesday and met with Iraqi officials to
come up with a ``working schedule,'' Amin was quoted as saying.
	   Unannounced visits in the past have been a major source of
friction with Iraq, leading to three crises in the past year.
	   Iraqi newspapers carried further accounts Wednesday of comments
by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz in Moscow in which he said
there is a limit to Iraq's cooperation with the United Nations in
the search for weapons of mass destruction.
	   Meanwhile, in a letter released Wednesday, Iraqi Foreign
Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf appealed for help from Arab
countries, which he said had largely deserted Iraq.
	   In November, several key Arab countries declared that Iraq would
be held responsible for any conflict.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Enraged by Israel's refusal to
release security prisoners, Palestinians stoned Israeli troops
Wednesday in the most widespread West Bank clashes in months. A
17-year-old stone mason was killed by Israeli gunfire and scores of
other Palestinians were injured.
	   The violence came despite U.S. appeals for calm and raised new
concerns that U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to the region
next week is triggering unrest, rather than reassuring Israelis and
Palestinians about their troubled peace accord, as intended.
	   On the outskirts of West Bank towns, thousands of Palestinians
hurled stones from slingshots at helmeted Israeli soldiers who
fired tear gas, live rounds and rubber-coated steel pellets.
	   In scences reminiscent of the 1987-1993 Palestinian uprising
which began exactly 11 years ago Wednesday, streets were littered
with rocks and overturned metal trash containers, and walls of
thick smoke from burning tires rose into the air.

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Nobel Peace laureates John Hume and David
Trimble, leaders of efforts to end Northern Ireland's three decades
of sectarian violence, both vowed Wednesday to overcome remaining
obstacles to peace.
	   ``I see this honor as a very powerful statement of support for
the peace process on our streets and that it will, in my opinion,
strengthen the peace process enormously,'' Hume, 61, said at a news
conference.
	   He and Trimble, 54, were named winners of the prize for their
work in pushing through an accord in April aimed at ending
bloodshed between those Catholics wanting Northern Ireland to
become a part of the Irish Republic, and Protestants wanting it to
remain a part of the United Kingdom.
	   Hume leads the Social Democratic and Labor Party, Northern
Ireland's largest Roman Catholic party, and Trimble heads the main
Protestant grouping, the Ulster Unionist Party.
	   Thursday's presentation of the prize comes in the shadow of a
dispute over Trimble's party demanding that the outlawed Irish
Republican Army begin to disarm before its political wing Sinn Fein
is allowed to join a new governing body for Northern Ireland.
	   Both Nobel laureates admitted that difficulties remain but said
peace must succeed.
	   ``There is no crisis,'' said Trimble, who shook hands with Hume
as they began a news conference. ``I don't accept that the process
is running into trouble. I know that it is not.''
	   At roughly the same time in London, Sinn Fein's chief negotiator
Martin McGuinness said Trimble has ``dismally failed'' in following
up the April peace accord. McGuinness accused Trimble of provoking
a crisis with his insistence that the IRA surrender its huge
weapons stockpiles.
	   In its October awards citation, the Nobel committee called Hume
``the clearest and most consistent of Northern Ireland's political
leaders in his work for a peaceful solution.'' The citation praised
Trimble for showing ``political courage ... at a critical stage in
the process.''
	   The latest dispute in peace process came last week with the
Ulster Unionist Party's demand for IRA disarmament before Sinn Fein
could be recognized.
	   The April peace agreement called for Protestant and Catholic
politicians forming a multiparty administration for Northern
Ireland and joint policy-making bodies with the Irish Republic by
October. Neither of those steps have been taken.
	   Despite delays, Trimble said he expected the body to be in place
in March or April.
	   Hume called the peace accord a watershed and said it was the
duty of all parties to carry out the will of the people, since
voters in both parts of Ireland had endorsed the plan in
referendums.
	   ``A couple of years ago, who would have thought that the two
governments and all the parties would have been in the same room in
a totally peaceful atmosphere? That in itself is a major progress
given our past.'' Hume said.
	   Hume said the people of Northern Ireland already felt safer,
while Trimble said one remaining problem was the creation of a
normal police force capable of dealing with the new danger of
organized crime.
	   The laureates were just two of many involved in the peace
process, including Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams.
	   At the news conference, Trimble was asked how he expects peace
to succeed when he refuses to even shake hands with Adams.
	   ``The original idea of a handshake is that someone offered us an
empty hand to show there were no weapons in it. I look forward to
the time Mr. Adams and his associates are able to show an empty
hand. That time will come,'' Trimble said
	   The Nobel Prizes, which include a 7.6 million Swedish kronor
(dlrs 950,000) award and a gold medal, are always presented on the
Dec. 10 anniversary of the death of their benefactor, Alfred Nobel,
a Swede who invented dynamite. The peace prize is awarded in Oslo
and the other prizes in Stockholm, Sweden.
	   Trimble and Hume are to accept their Nobel prize at a gala
ceremony in Oslo's city hall on Thursday, followed by a traditional
torchlight parade and a banquet in their honor. On Friday, events
celebrating their prize include the Nobel Peace Concert.

Supreme Court cancels army exemptions for rabbinical students

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a landmark decision which sent a jolt
through Israel's Orthodox Jewish community, Israel's Supreme Court
Wednesday ended a 50-year-old deal which allowed thousands of
rabbinical students a ticket out of Israel's military draft.
	   Secular Jews, who serve up to three years mandatory service in
the army, hailed the decision. Orthodox lawmakers and officials
called for a national dialogue to bridge the deepening divide
between the two communities. Only the seminary students appeared
unconcerned.
	   Army exemptions for some 30,000 seminary students has been one
of Israel's touchiest social issues, a banner for the on-going
conflict between secular and Orthodox Israelis and the role of
religion in a democracy.
	   Israeli men are drafted at the age of 18, serve three years in
the army, and return each year for up to 40 days of reserve duty
into their 40s. Women serve 20 months. By contrast, students in a
yeshiva - a Jewish seminary - are exempt from any kind of service
and are paid to study, and do not work.
	   For secular Jews who put their lives on the line as soldiers in
Lebanon or the West Bank and then must pay full college tuition on
their own, the exemption has created years of anger and resentment
towards the minority Orthodox community.
	   Voting unanimously, an unusually large 11-member panel of
Israeli Supreme Court justices declared the mass exemptions
``illegal,'' and ordered Israel's parliament to approve a new
arrangement within one year.
	   Amnon Rubinstein, a liberal lawmaker who helped sponsored the
petition to the high court, was triumphant. ``Enough is enough,''
he declared. ``It's about time they realize that they can't go on
with this public scandal of discrimination against us, our sons,
our friends, and our friends' sons.''
	   When Israel's first prime minister, David Ben Gurion, agreed to
exempt yeshiva students in a conciliatory gesture towards the
then-tiny Orthodox community at the state's inception, the
arrangement applied to 600 students. Today about 30,000 Israeli men
have acquired deferments.
	   Abuse of the exemptions angers Israelis as much as the system
itself. Local reporters and state comptroller reports have
repeatedly found large numbers of ultra-Orthodox men working or
loitering instead of studying, as required by their draft
deferments.
	   Translating the court's decision into a draft of religious
students will be an almost impossible task because of the political
clout of the ultra-Orthodox parties in Israel's parliament.
	   Oren Avaraham, a 24-year-old yeshiva student in an
ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of Jerusalem brushed off Wednesday's
decision. ``It'll never happen,'' he said.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government
depends on the support of the ultra-Orthodox political parties who
will fight to keep the exemptions which brings both money and
students to their religious educational institutions.
	   Netanyahu pledged that during the year allocated by the Supreme
Court, he would work out a deal ''that will prevent a split in the
people.''
	   For Yaakov Amar, a 17-year-old religious student, the new
decision could have a greater impact. Most Israelis his age are
preparing for induction into the military but Amar has other plans.
``I hope to be an important rabbi in Israel,'' said the intense
youth, outside his yeshiva on a narrow, old street in Jerusalem.
``I wish the others well; I feel bad for every Israeli soldier who
dies in Lebanon, but my place is here,'' he emphasized.

New threat by right-wingers against film depicting lesbian love
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Hindu right-wingers who attacked cinema
theaters in two cities have threatened to act in a third if
screenings of a film depicting lesbian love are not stopped,
theater owners said Wednesday.
	   ``They said the film screening had been stopped in Delhi and
Bombay and we should also do likewise, or they will take certain
steps,'' Mantu Bhattacharya, cinema theater owner in the eastern
metropolis of Calcutta, told the private STAR television network.
	   Activists from the right-wing Shiv Sena party have stormed
theaters in Bombay and New Delhi to block the screening of
``Fire.'' They call the sexual content of the film an affront to
Hindu values.
	   Fearing violence, the theater owners have discontinued screening
of the controversial film.
	   ``It is a kind of threat,'' Bhattacharya said.
	   The film is drawing huge Bengali crowds in Calcutta, capital of
the West Bengal state. Nandita Das, one of the two leading
actresses in the film, is Bengali.
	   ``Fire'' is the story of women in unhappy marriages to two
brothers living in New Delhi in what is called a joint family _ the
brothers, both their wives and their mother under one roof. The
sisters-in-law, seeking comfort, develops a lesbian relationship.
	   ``Fire'' tackles the issue rarely addressed in India.
	   The film, with scenes of two women kissing and a brief
full-frontal nude shot, created ripples in conservative India. It
ran to packed houses for three weeks before Shiv Sena began its
violent campaign.
	   Leading film personalities have petitioned India's Supreme Court
seeking protection for the film's screenings. The court Wednesday
set a hearing for next Tuesday, but chided the petitioners for
going to the press even while the case was being heard.
	   After the ruling, the film's director Deepa Mehta canceled a
packed press conference minutes before it was about to begin. Mehta
said she had been advised not to speak to the media by her lawyers.
	   Actress Das, and her co-actress Shabana Azmi, who is also a
lawmaker in the upper house of India's parliament, were also
scheduled to speak at the news conference.
	   Last week, the Hindu nationalists-led federal government sent
back the film to censors for a review. The film was earlier cleared
by the censors.
	   The Bharatiya Janata Party and the Shiva Sena are coalition
partners.

U.S. historian says Khrushchev opposed Berlin Wall
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CARL HARTMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev long opposed
building the Berlin Wall and only consented weeks before it went
up, says an American historian who has been mining archives in
Berlin and Moscow for eight years.
	   The wall, according to historian Hope M. Harrison, was
championed by Walter Ulbricht, head of East Germany's Stalinist
government. Often derided as a puppet, Ulbricht swung weight in
Moscow but it was largely ``strength through weakness,'' she said.
Conditions were so bad under his rule that he needed help from the
Soviets to maintain the communist system.
	   Russian opposition to the idea of a wall to keep East Germans
from fleeing west went back to the period just after Stalin's death
in 1953, according to documents quoted by Ms. Harrison.
	   ``The Soviets kept saying: in order to solve this refugee
problem you need to change your policy, you need to lighten up.
Don't make life so hard for all of these people and then they'll
stay,'' she said at a Cold War study program last weekend at the
Woodrow Wilson Center for Scholars.
	   ``And the East German leadership under Ulbricht, in contrast,
simply didn't want to lighten up in their policy and really wanted
to solve the refugee exodus in one way: namely closing the
border.''
	   The conflict continued into the 1960s.
	   ``(In) a speech (Ulbricht) was giving to the Warsaw Pact in
March of 1961 ... he asked to build the wall and was told (by
Khrushchev) 'Wait until I meet with Kennedy in June,' and after
that Khrushchev gave the go-ahead,'' she said.
	   Khrushchev told Kennedy at their Vienna summit that West Berlin
should be turned into a demilitarized ``free city'' on the
territory of East Germany, which surrounded it.
	   The following month, 30,415 refugees registered in West Berlin,
many of them fleeing by foot and subway from East Berlin. Losing so
many capable people threatened the economy of Ulbricht's ``German
Democratic Republic.''
	   Khrushchev finally saw no other way out for East Germany, which
he considered a showcase for communism and capable of surpassing
the booming economy of West Germany.
	   Until Aug. 13, 1961, when East German police began stringing
barbed wire on the western side of the Brandenburg Gate, the border
between East and West Berlin was virtually open. After the wall
went up, it was 28 years until the barriers were torn down,
allowing Germany to reunite in 1990.
	   David Murphy, CIA chief in Berlin at the time, said it's now
apparent that the ``East German tail wagged the Soviet dog much
more than the west realized.''
	   Murphy said the CIA warned President Dwight Eisenhower more than
a year before the wall went up that the Communists would have to do
something drastic about the refugees.
	   ``In May 1960 we pulled together reports snd the experience of
our officers and did a memorandum for U.S. delegates to the Paris
conference,'' he said.
	   ``I took it to Paris because I was assigned to the delegation as
a consultant. We predicted that the Soviets or the East Germans
would have to change the modalities of movement through the sector
border (in Berlin). They could not continue to allow a flow of this
magnitude without serious security problems.''
	   The Paris conference broke up when Eisenhower would not make a
formal apology to Khrushchev for Gary Powers' U-2 espionage flight,
shot down over the Soviet Union.
	   Ulbricht took a much riskier line than Khrushchev on relations
with the United States, which had troops in Berlin. After the wall
went up there was a tense stand-off at an international
crossing-point _ Checkpoint Charlie. Tanks rolled in to face the
lined-up American armor.
	   But not a shot was fired and eventually both sides pulled back.
	   Later Gen. Lucius Clay, President John F. Kennedy's sprecial
representative, told an Associated Press correspondent in an
interview during the crisis:
	   ``It was the greatest relief in my life when I found they were
Russian tanks, not East German tanks.''
	   It was off the record at the time. Clay died in 1978.
	   Ms. Harrison found Ulbricht's letter to Khrushchev on the Berlin
crisis in the party archives. ``I must say the adversary undertook
fewer counter-measures than were expected,'' Ulbricht wrote.
	   Khrushchev asked Ulbricht not to do anything to make the Berlin
situation worse, because of impending negotiations with the West.
	   Khrushchev was ousted in 1964 and died in 1971. Ulbricht died in
1973.
	   ___
	   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Carl Hartman, a reporter in Washington, was AP
correspondent in Berlin from 1959 thru 1961. He is the reporter who
interviewed Gen. Lucius Clay during the crisis over the wall.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The U.S. envoy for Kosovo headed
back to the region Wednesday to try to revive the stalled peace
process for the embattled Yugoslav province.
	   Christopher Hill, who is also the U.S. ambassador to neighboring
Macedonia, was due to meet members of the ethnic Albanian
negotiating team and the political representative for the
province's separatist guerrillas.
	   The United States and its allies are urging the Serbs and ethnic
Albanians to compromise after both sides rejected Washington's
latest peace plan.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also criticized the
two sides, warning the Serbs to stop threats of new offensives and
telling the ethnic Albanians to abandon their ``rhetoric of
independence.''
	   Last week, Hill offered a revised formula for greater self-rule
for Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's Serb republic, with a
majority ethnic Albanian population.

Chechen leader says hostages killed while rescue was in works
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with Chirac urging release of French hostage in new
last two grafs. &QL; 
 &UR; By RUSLAN MUSAYEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechen police were searching Wednesday
for the bodies of four kidnapped foreigners who were beheaded
during a botched attempt to free them.
	   The deaths _ and the ostentatious display of the heads by
killers _ prompted neighboring Russian regions to close off roads
into Chechnya, and caused an outpouring of outrage and lament from
Russian and foreign officials.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said Wednesday that one
alleged kidnapper had been arrested and authorities gleaned enough
information to launch a rescue operation for the hostages, three
Britons and a New Zealander.
	   But during the rescue attempt the kidnappers panicked and
decapitated the captives, Maskhadov said, according to Russian
media reports.
	   ``A concrete criminal group was identified, an organizer of the
abductions was arrested and an approximate location of the hostages
was determined,'' Maskhadov said in a statement.
	   The severed heads of the four men were found lined up along a
highway Tuesday outside Chechnya's capital Grozny, and hundreds of
Chechen law enforcement officers were searching for the bodies
Wednesday.
	   ``We will take all necessary steps to solve this horrible
crime,'' said Maskhadov, who has been unable to restore law and
order in Chechnya since being elected last year.
	   The victims _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf
Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were identified by their
former bodyguard. They had been abducted by unidentified gunmen
Oct. 3 in Grozny.
	   The men were employees of Britain's Granger Telecom, and were
working with Chechnya's communications firm, Chechen Telecom, to
set up a mobile phone network in Chechnya, which was devastated
during the 1994-96 war for independence from Russia.
	   The Chechen Telecom office was attacked before dawn Wednesday by
assailants using grenade launchers. One guard was wounded, security
officials said. Several Chechen Telecom employees have been
kidnapped in recent days.
	   It was unclear whether there was any link between Wednesday's
attack and the deaths of the hostages.
	   However, there have been reports that rival groups in Chechnya
were seeking money from the contract to rebuild the country's phone
system.
	   Meanwhile, three Russian republics bordering Chechnya blocked
off all roads leading to and from the secessionist territory.
	   ``The Chechen republic has been sealed off from all sides,''
Magomet Khatuyev, the head of Chechnya's border service, told
Interfax.
	   Since the war ended, Chechnya has been running its own affairs.
But it has been plagued by criminal gangs and there are frequent
kidnappings for ransom. Most hostages have been released unharmed,
though dozens remain in captivity.
	   ``The Russian government throughout has sought to be as helpful
as it can within its power, but that power is very limited in
Chechnya,'' said British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who met his
Russian counterpart Igor Ivanov on Wednesday in Belgium.
	   British Foreign Office Minister Tony Lloyd told the House of
Commons Wednesday that the situation in Chechnya is ``unstable and
confused'' and said it wouldn't be wise to risk further lives by
sending British officials into the region to investigate.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair described the murder as ``tragic and
horrifying.''
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin expressed outrage at the
killings and urged law enforcement officials to crack down on
kidnappings.
	   Russia's Foreign Ministry on Wednesday reiterated its
recommendation that foreigners not visit Chechnya, Interfax said.
	   French President Jacques Chirac telephoned Yeltsin on Wednesday
to urge a quick release of a French hostage believed to be held in
Chechnya, Russia's ORT television reported.
	   Vincent Cochetel, head of a regional office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees, was abducted Jan. 29 by three masked
gunmen in North Ossetia, near Chechnya.

Gulf leaders agree to extend oil cuts until end of 1999

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Gulf Arab states on
Wednesday decided to extend cuts in oil production until the end of
1999 in a bid to raise record-low prices that have squeezed their
petrodollar economies.
	   Ending a three-day summit, leaders of the six-nation Gulf
Cooperation Council also urged other oil producers to undertake
similar cuts ``to achieve market stability for the benefit of
producers and consumers.''
	   A statement issued at the end of the summit said the GCC leaders
``agreed to extend their pledged cuts until the end of 1999.''
	   The statement refers to the pledges made in June by members of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and producers
outside the cartel to withdraw 3.1 million barrels a day from the
market for one year until June 1999. OPEC's share of that was 2.6
million barrels per day.
	   Four GCC's constituents _ Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar,
Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates _ are members of OPEC and
together control half the world's proven reserves of oil.
	   The non-OPEC members of GCC are Oman and Bahrain.
	   On Tuesday, Gulf sources attending the meetings had told The
Associated Press that GCC oil ministers agreed to further
production cuts. But GCC Secretary-General Jamil al-Hojeilan denied
that.
	   Oil producing countries have differed widely on how to boost
record-low oil prices, caused by depressed demand in recession-hit
Asia and a warm winter in the West. The GCC states depend on oil
exports for 75 percent of their revenue.

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ The father of American gymnast Dominique Moceanu
testified Wendesday that he met with a private investigator to
learn where his estranged daughter was living.
	   Dumitru Moceanu spoke at a hearing in which a judge will decide
whether to grant the 17-year-old Olympic champion's request to make
permanent a temporary restraining order against her father.
	   Moceanu sometimes rolled her eyes during her father's testimony
under questioning by her court-appointed attorney, Ellen Yarrell.
She also ignored attempts by her mother, Camelia, to make eye
contact in the courtroom.
	   Dumitru Moceanu said he never paid a private investigator even
though he met with one three times. The gymnast had not told her
parents of her new address since state District Judge John
Montgomery granted her adult status on Oct. 28.
	   ``I talk with investigator just to find the address,'' said
Dumitru Moceanu, a Romanian immigrant. ``I don't pay him.''
	   Dumitru Moceanu also denied following his daughter, but conceded
that he asked her to pull over at a stoplight after school
recently.
	   Since she attained legal adulthood, Moceanu says she's endured
verbal threats and stalking by her father. Police also are
investigating a private investigator's claim that Dumitru Moceanu
offered to pay dlrs 10,000 to have a friend and her coach killed.
	   Tape recordings thought to include threats were submitted by the
Houston Police Department Wednesday morning for the judge's review
in chambers. They were not entered formally into evidence.
	   ``The threat of danger from my father hangs over me every day,''
the gymnast said in court papers filed a week ago for the
restraining order.
	   The gymnast was supported in court by several friends and her
publicist, Janey Miller. The conflict began when she decided to
fight for control over her millions in earnings and has escalated
ever since.

insisted Wednesday that diplomacy aimed at resolving the conflict
is ``still on track'' despite rejection by all sides of the latest
peace proposal.
	   Christopher Hill spoke after launching a new round of shuttle
talks in the turbulent province, where the ethnic Albanian majority
and Serbian authorities have refused to budge from their main
demands.
	   An October truce that halted months of combat between separatist
rebels and Serb forces is largely holding. But many expect fighting
to resume by spring if a political settlement is not reached.
	   Frequent shooting incidents have marred the shaky peace _ the
latest a report of attacks by gunmen on two Serb police patrols
Wednesday that injured two policeman.
	   Hill, returning to the region from Washington, met for several
hours with ethnic Albanian negotiators in Pristina. He planned to
meet later with a political representative of the Kosovo Liberation
Army.
	   He has scheduled talks Thursday in Belgrade with the Serbian
side, which formally rejected the latest U.S. draft on Wednesday.
	   ``We believe that our negotiations are still on track,'' Hill,
who also is U.S. ambassador to neighboring Macedonia, told
reporters.
	   ``Ultimately the responsibility of reaching a settlement rests
with both sides,'' he said. ``They need to find ways to
compromise.''
	   Both Hill and Wolfgang Petritsch, the European Union envoy for
Kosovo, who joined in the talks, cited the urgency of trying to
reach a settlement soon in order to head off new fighting.
Petritsch expressed optimism that ``something should be achieved in
the next couple of weeks.''
	   ``This is a very decisive point in time,'' he said. ``We mustn't
lose the momentum.''
	   Based on their public statements, the gulf between the sides
appears huge. Hill admitted that ``it's not an easy process.''
	   The ethnic Albanian officials insist on a solution that would
break away Kosovo from Serbia, while the KLA has said it won't
accept anything short of outright independence.
	   Senior Serbian officials, including President Milan Milutinovic,
formally rejected the latest Hill plan Wednesday, reiterating
support for a Serb draft which keeps the province firmly within the
republic.
	   They did not elaborate in a statement issued by the official
Tanjug news agency. But a day earlier, Serbian negotiator Ratko
Markovic said the U.S. draft would require ``reconstructing the
whole of Yugoslavia'' and lead to independence for Kosovo.
	   Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians comprise about 90 percent of a
population of 2 million, had autonomy until then-Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic revoked it in 1989.
	   After KLA rebels began attacking the police forces that maintain
a massive presence in the province, Serbian forces launched a
crackdown last February that killed hundreds of people and uprooted
an estimated 300,000 from their homes.
	   Periodic violence has continued. The pro-government Serb Media
Center said groups of armed Albanian gunmen attacked police patrols
Wednesday afternoon near Dolovo village in western Kosovo and
Opterusa in the southwest.
	   Two policemen were reported hospitalized as a result of the
Dolovo attack, including one with serious injuries.

Weightlifter returns positive test to diuretic

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Jordanian weightlifter Ayed Jasser
Khawaldeh was expelled after becoming the first athlete of these
Asian Games to return a positive drugs test, the Olympic Council of
Asia said Thursday.
	   Khawaldeh, 25, tested positive to diuretic triamterene and
admitted the offense at a meeting between OCA officials and the
Jordanian team, the OCA said.
	   ``(He) stated that he used the substance while he was on a
three-week training camp, knowing that it was a diuretic,'' the OCA
added in a statement released after a midnight meeting to discuss
the case. It said it had sent a ``strong warning'' to the Jordanian
Olympic Committee because of the test result.
	   The drug helped Khawaldeh lose weight to compete in the
56-kilogram class on Monday. He placed seventh.
	   The OCA said his usual body weight is 60 kilograms but he
weighed in at 55.8 kilograms on the day of competition.
	   Khawaldeh has been expelled from the athletes' village, had his
results voided and will face a two-year ban from the International
Weightlifting Federation.
	   OCA president Sheikh Ahmad Al-Sabah said he was surprised by the
positive result because Khawaldeh had not been expected to contend
for medals.
	   ``I'm still crossing my fingers that it will be the only case
because in Hiroshima we had, as everybody knows, 11 cases,'' Sheihk
Ahmad said. ``If we have one, maximum two, cases this will be very
useful for the movement in this continent and will show we are
solving the problem.''
	   Eleven Chinese team members returned positive tests at the
previous games in 1994 but they were not made public until after
the event.
	   OCA medical committee chairman Yoshio Kuroda said the organizers
had spent about dlrs 4.5 million on the drug fight here.
	   All drug tests at the games are being carried out with the most
sophisticated tool available, a half-million-dollar piece of
equipment called a carbon isotope ratio mass spectrometer.
	   The technology was first used at the Winter Olympics in Nagano,
Japan, earlier this year but for only one in every five drug tests.

Surgery is riskier than no treatment for some brain aneurysms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Surgery may be riskier than no treatment at all for many
patients with small brain aneurysms, spots where a weak wall in a
blood vessel has bulged out.
	   A major study found that if someone has never had a burst
aneurysm before, the chance that a small one in the front of the
brain will rupture and cause a stroke is less than one-twentieth of
1 percent a year.
	   By comparison, there is about a 10 percent risk of death or
brain damage from surgery to repair such an aneurysm, the study
found. A small aneurysm was defined as one about three-eighths of
an inch (.94 centimeters) or less.
	   ``It would be very difficult to improve upon that natural
history,'' said the study's director, Dr. David O. Wiebers of the
Mayo Clinic.
	   The risks of surgery were larger than previous studies
indicated, partly because this one included patients' problems in
thinking, while earlier studies looked at their problems with
movement and their ability to care for themselves.
	   About 5 percent of people _ 10 million to 15 million Americans _
either have or will develop an intracranial aneurysm, where a weak
spot balloons out in the wall of an artery in the brain.
	   These bulges are a small but very deadly cause of strokes. Burst
aneurysms cause about 20 percent of all strokes _ 600,000 out of 3
million in 1996 in the United States _ but about 80 percent of
stroke deaths, or about 128,300 deaths.
	   What hasn't been clear is whether doctors should operate to fix
these weak spots before they break. To help settle the issue,
Wiebers directed a study of 2,721 patients at 53 hospitals in the
United States, Canada and Europe.
	   It is the first big study to look at when surgery is needed to
fix aneurysms, said Dr. John Marler of the National Institutes of
Health, which paid for it.
	   Ten years ago, doctors found only one ballooned brain artery for
every nine that already had burst. But the question of preventive
surgery is coming up more and more often because brain scans
performed for other reasons are finding more aneurysms.
	   ``You don't like to be walking around knowing there's a weakness
in a blood vessel in your brain and it can pop out and kill you.
You want to think there's something you can do,'' Marler said.
``This helps answer the question: `What should I do now that you've
found this thing?'''
	   It is unclear how many operations could be avoided because of
the new study. Marler guessed that doctors operate on perhaps 1
percent of small aneurysms that aren't causing any other problems.
But even 1 percent translates to 100,000 operations.
	   Still, doctors warned that the study should not be taken as a
warning against any surgery. Each case must be decided on its own,
and a 60-year-old and a 30-year-old may have different ideas about
what risk is acceptable, they said.
	   ``A generalization that an intracranial aneurysm is little risk
and nothing needs to be done would be grossly misleading and
dangerous,'' said Dr. Neil Martin, a neurosurgeon and co-director
of the UCLA Stroke Center.

European drug makers Zeneca and Astra to merge

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Sweden's Astra and Britain's Zeneca
confirmed Wednesday they will merge in a dlrs 37 billion deal that
will create one of the world's biggest drug manufacturers.
	   Astra is best known for Prilosec, an ulcer and heartburn
medication that's the world's top selling prescription drug. Zeneca
is the second biggest maker in the world of cancer drugs behind
U.S.-based Bristol-Myers Squibb.
	   The companies said about 6,000 jobs, or 11 percent of the
combined global workforce, are expected to be lost in the next
three years as a result of the merger. They expect annual cost
savings of dlrs 1.1 billion from the new company, which will be
called AstraZeneca. However, they expect to incur about dlrs 1.2
billion in restructuring costs.
	   The merger had been rumored for months and was expected given
the wave of deals in the pharmaceutical industry. Last week,
Germany's Hoechst and France's Rhone-Poulenc agreed to merge their
drug and agrichemical businesses as the first step toward a total
merger. In France, Sanofi and Synthelabo recently announced their
dlrs 10 billion merger.
	   Behind all these mergers in Europe and the United States is the
need to increase research spending to compete with giants such as
Pfizer, Glaxo Wellcome and Merck, and the desire to pool resources
to boost marketing.
	   ``If we are going to be competitive among world pharmaceutical
companies, we need this merger,'' said Hakan Mogren, chief
executive of Astra, who will be deputy chairman of the new company.
	   Sweden's Wallenberg family owns 12 percent of Astra, established
in 1913. The company is also the maker of lidocaine, one of the
leading local anesthesia drugs first developed in the 1940s.
	   While its best known for Prilosec, the drug is scheduled to lose
its patent protection in 2001. That will open the door for generic
firms to make a less expensive copy and slow the company's overall
sales growth.
	   Besides its cancer drugs, Zeneca also has a large agrichemical
business and owns Salick Health Care, a U.S. operator of cancer
treatment and dialysis centers. Last year, the company marketed its
the migraine drug Zomig, which it bought from Glaxo Wellcome in
1995 while the drug was still being tested in humans.
	   But like Astra, Zeneca also has several drugs that are expected
to soon lose their patent protection. Analysts speculated that was
a leading factor influencing the merger.
	   ``This is a winning combination,'' said Sergio Traversa, an
analyst with Mehta Partners, a drug industry investment firm.
``Both are strong in limited areas.''
	   The AstraZeneca corporate headquarters would be in London, the
research and development headquarters in Sweden.
	   The chairman of the new company will be Percy Barnevik, who
heads Investor AB, the investment of arm of the Wallenberg family.
Zeneca's top executive, Tom McKillop, will be CEO.
	   The deal, which is considered a merger of equals, has already
been approved by the board of directors of both companies.
	   Zeneca had dlrs 8.57 billion in sales in 1997 and has a current
market value of dlrs 38.62 billion. Astra posted dlrs 5.68 billion
in sales in 1997 and has a current market value of dlrs 24.48
billion.
	   Both companies had earnings of dlrs 1.2 billion in 1997.

`White knight' from Quebec wades into Toronto newspaper battle
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Owners of the Toronto Sun, a tabloid targeted for
hostile takeover by crosstown rival The Toronto Star, said
Wednesday they have approved a friendly purchase offer from
Montreal-based publisher and printer Quebecor Inc.
	   Quebecor, publisher of the tabloid Le Journal de Montreal, made
a cash offer to Sun Media Corp. of dlrs 983 million (dlrs 639
million U.S.).
	   That topped the recently increased offer by Torstar Corp. of
dlrs 900 million (dlrs 585 million U.S.), up from its initial bid
in October of dlrs 748 million (dlrs 486 million U.S.).
	   Quebecor plans to combine Sun Media's assets with its own
newspapers in a new publishing division, to be headed by Sun
Media's chief executive, Paul Godfrey.
	   Torstar could try to outbid Quebecor by raising its own bid
again, but its chances of getting enough support among Sun Media
shareholders are slight, according to Quebecor and Sun Media
executives.
	   Sun Media said its board of directors has unanimously approved
the Quebecor offer and will recommend the bid to shareholders. The
offer is scheduled to be mailed by Dec. 18.
	   Torstar's takeover bid on Oct. 28 provoked anger at Sun Media
and surprise elsewhere in Canada, because the Star _ Canada's
largest circulation paper _ and the Toronto Sun are so different in
style and outlook.
	   The Star is perhaps the country's most earnestly liberal paper,
with strong sympathies for feminism, anti-poverty programs and gay
rights, among many other causes. The Sun is home to several of
Canada's most caustic right-wing columnists and features a
bikini-clad Sunshine Girl on Page Three each day.
	   ``The Torstar deal was all good for Torstar,'' Godfrey told Sun
employees. ``Torstar wanted to be more like Sun Media, but we
didn't think we wanted to be more like Torstar.''
	   Quebecor is Canada's largest commercial printer. It also
publishes daily papers in Montreal, Quebec City, Winnipeg,
Manitoba, and Sherbrooke, Quebec, and 56 weekly papers.
	   Sun Media publishes seven dailies, including Sun tabloids in
Toronto, Ottawa, Calgary and Edmonton.
	   The proposed deal would give Quebecor nearly a quarter of
national newspaper circulation, second to the 40 percent controlled
by Conrad Black's Hollinger and Southam groups.

Romania, Ukraine to sign military cooperation agreement

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine and Romania plan to sign a military
cooperation treaty next year and may set up a joint engineering
battalion to deal with natural calamities, officials said
Wednesday.
	   The cooperation will include officer exchanges, modernizing
Romania's T-85 tanks and Mig-29 warplanes, and joint sales of
weapons to third countries, said Ukrainian Defense Minister
Oleksandr Kuzmuk after talks Wednesday with visiting Romanian
Defense Minister Victor Babiuc.
	   Babiuc also held talks in Kiev with President Leonid Kuchma.
	   ``Cooperation is a necessity, because each country must
participate in maintaining regional security,'' Babiuc told
reporters Wednesday.
	   Kuzmuk said experts from both nations are to devise cooperation
projects by February 1999.
	   Kuzmuk also said that Kuchma supported setting up a joint
Ukrainian-Romanian engineering battalion, adding that the idea came
up following last month's devastating floods in western Ukraine.
	   ``Such a battalion can be the first to help'' in natural
disasters, and can also be used for peacekeeping missions, Kuzmuk
said.
	   Babiuc, who arrived in Kiev on Wednesday for a two-day official
visit, is due to tour a Ukrainian land forces training range and
visit the Armed Forces Academy before leaving Thursday.

Ukrainian opposition newspaper shut down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian authorities have shut down an
opposition newspaper, a move its editor charged Wednesday was
revenge for critical and anti-corruption materials he published.
	   Oleh Lyashko, editor-in-chief of the Politika newspaper, said he
was informed by a publishing house Tuesday that a Kiev court had
annulled the paper's registration.
	   Lyashko charged that the decision was apparently made ``in
retrospect,'' as it was dated Oct. 6 and no newspaper
representatives had been summoned to the court before the decision
became known Tuesday, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Lyashko said the court revoked Politika's registration because
the newspaper had unveiled unspecified state secrets in an article
about Ukraine's Security Service.
	   He said he was ``convinced'' that Politika was closed down over
a recent series of articles on alleged corruption in President
Leonid Kuchma's entourage.
	   ``In this case, I don't see the hand of the president. I think
it's an action by people who wish to arrange for Leonid Kuchma to
look as if he's strangling the press,'' Lyashko said.
	   Earlier this year, tax officials blocked Politika's bank
accounts and a criminal case was launched against the paper,
preventing it from being published for several months. The Kiev
arbitration court ruled against the tax authorities earlier this
month.
	   Opposition newspapers in Ukraine often allege persecution by
authorities, but government officials say the fault lies with the
newspapers, who often present faulty registration papers or publish
libelous materials.

Kuchma speaks in favor of floating hryvna rate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's President Leonid Kuchma urged the
central bank Wednesday to remove restrictions on the purchase of
dollars and introduce a floating rate for the country's hryvna
currency.
	   Kuchma said he was ``convinced ... that the limitations on
foreign currency trading should be lifted, as they always lead to
abuses.''
	   The remarks reflected Kuchma's recent support of softer monetary
policies _ including lifting currency controls and printing more
money _ to ease the government's mounting foreign and domestic debt
burden.
	   Last week, Kuchma ordered the Cabinet and the National Bank to
study the possibility of allowing the hryvna to float freely as of
Jan. 1, abandoning its present trading band, which limits the
exchange rate.
	   On Wednesday, speaking during a visit to a Kiev medicine plant,
Kuchma was more cautious and gave no precise date as to when the
floating rate might be introduced.
	   He said the government and the central bank must be ``very
careful and balanced in their calculations and see how the hard
currency behaves'' in case the hryvna is allowed to float.
	   The National Bank has worked to keep the hryvna stable since
November at about 3.4 to the U.S. dollar, within a government-set
trading band of 2.5 to 3.5 to the dollar.
	   The stabilization followed two months of financial troubles that
were caused in part by the economic crisis in neighboring Russia.
	   The National Bank has managed to temporarily stabilize the
markets over the past two months by imposing various currency
controls and limiting the dollar supply.
	   But the bank has warned repeatedly that the stability was too
fragile to permit looser monetary policies in the near future.

Armenian gas service officials arrested after explosion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ Two gas agency officials have been
charged in an explosion in a children's sanitarium in Armenia that
killed 12 people, officials said Wednesday.
	   Last week's blast in a cafeteria at the Dzhermuk resort was
caused by a defective gas pipe that had not been tested before use,
said Gurgen Ambarian, spokesman for Armenia's Prosecutor's Office.
	   Gas leaked through badly welded seams in the pipe, accumulated
in the cafeteria basement and eventually exploded, Ambarian said.
	   The regional gas service chief Knyaz Movsesian and his deputy
Karapet Yegoyan were arrested Tuesday and charged with abuse of
office that caused ``heavy consequences.''
	   If convicted, they could face 2 to 8 years in prison.
	   The children's sanitarium in Dzhermuk _ a well-known mineral
water resort 150 kilometers (90 miles) southeast of Armenia's
capital, Yerevan _ housed children accompanied by their mothers.
	   Thirteen people were also injured in the explosion.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine and Romania plan to sign a military
cooperation treaty next year and may set up a joint engineering
battalion to deal with natural calamities, officials said
Wednesday.
	   The cooperation will include officer exchanges, modernizing
Romania's T-85 tanks and Mig-29 warplanes, and joint sales of
weapons to third countries, said Ukrainian Defense Minister
Oleksandr Kuzmuk after talks Wednesday with visiting Romanian
Defense Minister Victor Babiuc.
	   Babiuc also held talks in Kiev with President Leonid Kuchma.
	   ``Cooperation is a necessity, because each country must
participate in maintaining regional security,'' Babiuc told
reporters Wednesday.
	   Kuzmuk said experts from both nations are to devise cooperation
projects by February 1999.
	   Kuzmuk also said that Kuchma supported setting up a joint
Ukrainian-Romanian engineering battalion, adding that the idea came
up following last month's devastating floods in western Ukraine.
	   ``Such a battalion can be the first to help'' in natural
disasters, and can also be used for peacekeeping missions, Kuzmuk
said.
	   Babiuc, who arrived in Kiev on Wednesday for a two-day official
visit, is due to tour a Ukrainian land forces training range and
visit the Armed Forces Academy before leaving Thursday.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Russian Deputy Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov
and his financial team met with the Paris Club of creditor nations
Wednesday, in part to discuss rescheduling payments of inherited
Soviet debt.
	   However, Paris Club officials said before the talks began that
they expected no formal rescheduling to come from this week's
talks, which continue Thursday and Friday.
	   Wednesday's talks at the Finance Ministry were expected to last
till midnight.
	   Russia is a creditor member of the Paris Club as well as a
debtor and rescheduling Russia's debts isn't on the rescheduling
agenda this week.
	   However, officials have said that they expected to discuss
Russia's debt situation.
	   Kasyanov, quoted by the ITAR-Tass news agency, told Russian
journalists that the Paris Club ``works only with the IMF, that is
only within the framework of a program which has yet to be
approved.''
	   Only after the program is approved can Russia and its creditors
begin ``concrete talks on the parameters of restructuring,''
Kasyanov said, according to ITAR-Tass.
	   Kasyanov added that Russia must reduce its foreign-debt service
to no more than dlrs 10 billion in 1999 from the dlrs 17.5 billion
maturing that year.
	   He said that Russia will pay all its post-Soviet debts on time
and in full, but must be allowed to reschedule the Soviet-era debt,
according to ITAR-Tass.
	   Kasyanov also said the international community should link the
Paris debt restructuring talks and the government's talks with the
International Monetary Fund.
	   ``Either international organizations must take more
responsibility in helping Russia, by giving it new credits, or
Paris Club must do this by reducing the size of Russian
foreign-debt payments,'' ITAR-Tass quoted him as saying.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Education officials on Wednesday suspended a teacher
in a small town outside Rome after he was accused of kicking a
12-year-old pupil hard enough to force removal of the boy's spleen.
	   Police are investigating the Dec. 3 incident at a public middle
school in Monterotondo.
	   The 45-year-old teacher allegedly kicked the boy as he stood in
a line with his classmates. The boy later fainted and was taken to
a hospital, where doctors removed his damaged spleen.
	   Authorities have refused to disclose the teacher's name. Italy's
ANSA news agency said the teacher admitted he had aimed what he
meant to be a light blow at the child. The child abruptly turned,
getting the full force of the kick, he allegedly said.
	   ``It was a freak accident, even though it shouldn't have
happened,'' said the school's vice principal, Maria Grazia
Ricciotti. ``The teacher is distraught. He doesn't deserve this.
He's a peaceful man, a friend of the children.''

Fate of 30 abused elephants still in doubt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ The fate of 30 elephants taken
from Botswana for export to zoos and game reserves took another
twist Wednesday with decisions by a German cabinet minister and a
South African judge.
	   The High Court in Pretoria, the capital, put a temporary hold on
a lower court's decision that the National Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty should take custody of the elephants from an
animal exporter whose trainers mistreated the animals.
	   Judge Buddy Swart ruled that the NSPCA will instead look after
the animals on the property of animal exporter Riccardo Ghiazza
until the court further deliberates the matter, said NSPCA
spokeswoman Marcelle French.
	   ``We'll be on the property 24 hours a day, looking after the
elephants,'' French vowed.
	   The judge's ruling applied to 23 of the elephants because
another court had already ruled that seven of the elephants could
be immediately exported to zoos and in Germany and in Switzerland
as Ghiazza had planned.
	   But German Environment Minister Juergen Trittin said Wednesday
he had barred the sale of the four elephants who were to have been
sent to zoos in Dresden and Erfurt.
	   ``An illegal business with threatened animals will not be done
with me,'' Trittin said in Bonn.
	   Three of the elephants were to go to a zoo in Bsel, Switzerland,
but there was no immediate word on whether the sale would proceed.
	   The NSPCA plans to care for all 30 elephants on Ghiazza's
property southwest of Pretoria until the fate of all of them is
determined, French said.
	   The capture in Augist of the 30 young elephants ignited outrage
among some international conservation groups, who say it was cruel
to snatch them from their family groups in Botswana.
	   Experts have testified that the elephants were prodded with
sharp sticks until they bled, that the wounds became infected and
that the animals were deprived of food and water.

U.S. envoy insists Kosovo negotiations `still on track'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The top U.S. envoy for Kosovo
insisted Wednesday that diplomatic efforts aimed at resolving the
conflict are ``still on track'' despite rejection by all sides of
the latest peace proposals.
	   Christopher Hill spoke after launching a new round of shuttle
talks in the turbulent province, where the ethnic Albanian majority
and Serbian authorities have refused to budge from their main
demands.
	   An October truce that halted months of fighting between
separatist rebels and Serb forces is largely holding. But many
expect fighting to resume by spring if a political settlement is
not reached.
	   Frequent shooting incidents have marred the shaky peace _ the
latest a report of attacks by gunmen on two Serb police patrols
Wednesday that injured two policeman, one seriously in the Kosovo
village of Dolovo.
	   After KLA rebels began attacking the police forces that maintain
a massive presence in the province, Serbian forces launched a
crackdown last February that killed hundreds of people and uprooted
an estimated 300,000 from their homes.
	   Hill, returning to the region from Washington, met for several
hours with ethnic Albanian negotiators in Pristina. He planned to
meet later with a political representative of the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   He has scheduled talks Thursday in Belgrade with the Serbian
side. Senior Serbian officials, including President Milan
Milutinovic, formally rejected the latest Hill plan Wednesday,
reiterating support for a Serb draft which keeps the province
firmly within the republic.
	   Ethnic Albanian negotiators insist on a solution that would
break away Kosovo from Serbia, while the KLA has said it won't
accept anything short of outright independence.
	   ``We believe that our negotiations are still on track,'' Hill,
who also is U.S. ambassador to neighboring Macedonia, said.
	   ``Ultimately the responsibility of reaching a settlement rests
with both sides,'' he said. ``They need to find ways to
compromise.''
	   Both Hill and Wolfgang Petritsch, the European Union envoy for
Kosovo, who also joined in the talks, cited the urgency of trying
to reach a settlement soon in order to head off new fighting.
Petritsch expressed optimism that ``something should be achieved in
the next couple of weeks.''
	   ``This is a very decisive point in time,'' he said. ``We mustn't
lose the momentum.''
	   Based on their public statements, the gulf between the Serbians
and Ethnic Albanians appears huge. Hill admitted that ``it's not an
easy process.''
	   Serbian negotiator Ratko Markovic said on Tuesday the U.S. draft
would require ``reconstructing the whole of Yugoslavia'' and lead
to independence for Kosovo.
	   Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians comprise about 90 percent of a
population of 2 million, had autonomy until then-Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic revoked it in 1989.

Le Pen dismisses deputy, accusing him of inciting rebellion

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The bitter feud that threatens to split the
far-right National Front reached new heights Wednesday when party
leader Jean-Marie Le Pen dismissed his ambitious heir apparent,
Bruno Megret, accusing him of inciting rebellion in party ranks.
	   Le Pen's move came only two hours after Megret broke his silence
of the past week to defy his boss and demand an emergency party
congress to solve their differences.
	   The rapid-fire events heralded a drawn-out showdown between the
two men _ sure to please opponents of a party that is widely seen
as racist and anti-Semitic, but consistently draws 15 percent of
French voters.
	   Le Pen, 70, has been the absolute leader of the party for a
quarter-century. But his increasingly public struggle with the
quieter and more pragmatic _ though no less ideological _ Megret
has weakened his hand.
	   At a packed news conference Wednesday, Megret said the party
``belongs to no one person. It belongs to the militants, all the
militants.''
	   ``I will never leave the National Front, neither by resigning
nor by being pushed out,'' Megret said.
	   He demanded an urgent meeting in January of the party's 50,000
or so members nationwide _ a demand that Le Pen, in a statement two
hours later, termed an effort ``to destabilize the movement.''
	   ``The comments he has made ... and his call to rebellion justify
that I remove him from the position of general delegate,'' Le Pen's
statement said.
	   He named Carl Lang, the party's vice-president, as a
replacement.
	   Megret had vainly insisted that his move was not aimed against
Le Pen personally.
	   ``If he sees this as a putsch, that is completely incorrect,''
Megret said.
	   But asked whether the party congress would consider choosing a
new president, Megret said only: ``I don't want to enter into those
considerations.''
	   The feud between Le Pen and Megret has been obvious for months.
But it burst into the open over the weekend, at a noisy party
meeting where Le Pen ejected several Megret supporters he'd fired a
few days earlier.
	   On Monday, a Le Pen loyalist, Serge Martinez, director of
personnel at the party, spoke out against his boss, and was
immediately fired.
	   Speculation mounted that the party would finally split. Some
thought Megret might announce his departure on Wednesday.
	   But Megret was betting on the support of the majority of party
members. He said Wednesday that party organizations in 11 of 22
regions support his call for a congress.
	   Le Pen and Megret share similar ideas; their party is virulently
opposed to immigration and to European integration. But the men
disagree over how to implement their ideas.
	   One of their key disputes was over Megret's strategy of making
electoral alliances with the mainstream right _ as the party did in
several regional elections in the spring.
	   Then, in the summer, Megret opposed Le Pen's plan to put his
politically inexperienced wife, Jany, in his place at the top of
the list for European Parliament elections if his legal troubles
rendered him ineligible.
	   In the end, the issue was moot _ Le Pen is appealing a one-year
ban on running for office, which means the sentence is frozen for
the time being. But it put the two men on a clear collision course.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The father of the 13-year-old heiress to
the Onassis shipping fortune was found guilty Wednesday of slander
and other charges leveled by the trustees of the girl's estate.
	   Thierry Roussel was sued by the four Greek trustees for slander,
perjury and filing a false lawsuit after he lost a court case in
which he accused them of fiscal mismanagement.
	   The verdict ended a five-week trial, during which Roussel and
the trustees exchanged heated exchanges. The court was expected to
later announce the penalty _ most likely a fine.
	   Athina Roussel, the granddaughter of the late shipping mogul
Aristotle Onassis, will inherit an estimated dlrs 600 million
fortune on her 18th birthday. Athina's mother, Christina Onassis,
died in 1988.
	   Athina lives in Switzerland with Roussel, his Swedish wife and
the couple's three children.
	   French-born Roussel and the trustees have been locked in a feud
over management of the estate. Roussel has failed in legal battles
in Greece to have the administration transferred to him.
	   A separate foundation manages the shipping and real estate
empire built by Onassis.

	   LONDON (AP) _ The Swedish and British drug makers Astra and
Zeneca announced Wednesday that they would merge in a bid to take
on the leading U.S. and European pharmaceutical companies.
	   The new company, AstraZeneca, will be the third-biggest company

with combined 1998 drug sales of about dlrs 11.5 billion.

the product mix, similar corporate cultures, and research and
development focus made the merger ``a good deal for both parties, a
good deal for the countries concerned, a good deal for
shareholders, and above all for patients.''
	   About 6,000 jobs _ 11 percent of the current combined workforce
of 54,000 _ will be eliminated, said Jon Symonds, finance director
of the new company. The losses will be spread throughout the world
over the next three years, he said.
	   AstraZeneca's corporate headquarters will be in London, with its
research and development headquarters in Sweden. The company will
be listed on the London, New York and Stockholm stock exchanges.
	   Tom McKillop, Zeneca's chief executive officer and the proposed
chief executive of the new company, said final merger documents are
expected by the end of the year and that he hoped for shareholder
and regulatory approval soon afterward.
	   ``I want AstraZeneca to be one of the world's great companies,''
McKillop said.
	   Last week, Germany's Hoechst and France's Rhone-Poulenc agreed
to merge their drug and agrochemical businesses as the first step
toward a total merger. In France, Sanofi and Synthelabo recently
announced their dlrs 10 billion merger.
	   Behind all these mergers is the need to increase research
spending to compete with giants such as Pfizer, Glaxo Wellcome and
Merck, and the desire to pool resources to boost marketing.
	   Astra and Zeneca, including non-pharmaceutical divisions, had
total 1997 sales of dlrs 15.9 billion, with pre-tax profit of dlrs
3.5 billion, the companies said. The combined market capitalization
was put at dlrs 67 billion. The companies said shares would be
merged on an equal-value basis.
	   Restructuring was projected to require three years' time and
cost about dlrs 1.2 billion, after which annual operating costs
would be lowered by about dlrs 1.1 billion.
	   ``Synergies are realistic and will be achieved, maybe even
exceeded,'' said Percy Barnevik, the proposed chairman of the
company. Barnevik currently heads Investor AB, the investment of
arm of Sweden's Wallenberg family, which owns 12 percent of Astra.
	   On the London Stock Exchange, Zeneca shares closed up 191 pence
(dlrs 3.05) at 2,711 pence (dlrs 43.37), while other pharmaceutical
companies' stocks also rose on speculation of further mergers.
Astra's shares rose by 12.9 percent, to 170.5 kronor (dlrs 21.21)
in trading on Stockholm's bourse.
	   Astra is best-known as the maker of Prilosec, an ulcer and
heartburn medication that is the world's best-selling prescription
drug. It comprises about half the company's total sales.
	   But the drug is scheduled to lose its patent protection in 2001,
opening the door for generic firms to make a less expensive copy
and slow the company's overall sales growth. Analysts speculated
that was a leading factor influencing the merger.
	   Astra, established in 1913, also makes lidocaine, a popular
local anesthesia.
	   Zeneca is the second-leading maker of cancer drugs behind
Bristol-Myers Squibb of the United States. It also has a large
agrochemical business and owns Salick Health Care, a U.S. operator
of cancer treatment and dialysis centers.
	   Last year, Zeneca introduced its migraine drug Zomig, and
earlier this year received clearance for a breast cancer drug. But
like Astra, Zeneca also has several cancer drugs expected to soon
lose their patent protection.

Libyan passengers commandeer Egyptian airliner in mid-air
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with plane flying with passengers to Cairo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Two masked men supported by some 150 Libyan
passengers took over a chartered Egyptian airliner in mid-air
Wednesday, demanding to be flown to Libya in violation of U.N.
sanctions.
	   The pilot, however, landed the plane in the Tunisian resort town
of Jerba where the protesters got off. But Tunisian authorities put
the passengers back on board and the aircraft flew to Cairo en
route to Yemen from where it had taken off.
	   Security forces surrounded the plane at the Cairo airport, and
reporters there did not see any passenger getting off. Officials
said the plane will refuel and fly to San`a, the Yemeni capital,
with the passengers.
	   It was not clear if the masked men were detained in Tunisia or
also sent back.
	   The drama began early Wednesday when two masked men burst into
the cockpit of the MD-90 aircraft soon after it took off for Tunis,
Tunisia. They wanted the plane to fly to the Libyan capital
Tripoli, Egyptian security officials said.
	   Many of the estimated 150 Libyans on board joined the masked
intruders and created a ruckus, the officials said quoting the
pilot who was in radio touch with Cairo airport. The officials
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   One Egyptian police official said the pilot was told by Egyptian
authorities that he could fly to Libya under duress without
violating sanctions, but the pilot apparently tricked the hijackers
and landed in Jerba, a Tunisian resort about 80 kilometers (50
miles) from Libya's northwest border.
	   Some passengers got off the plane in Jerba complaining of
exhaustion while many others remained on board demanding that the
aircraft be refueled, the officials said. But they too left the
aircraft later, said the officials.
	   Besides the Libyans, there were Tunisians and Yemenis on the
aircraft.
	   The aircraft was chartered by a private Egyptian company for a
flight by Libyan businessmen, the officials said. They said the
aircraft itself belongs to EgyptAir, the national carrier.
	   None of the passengers or crew was reported injured. Officials
said many of the passengers were carrying daggers, as is the custom
among Libyan and Yemeni men, but they did not use it to threaten
the crew.
	   Libya has frequently violated the U.N. flight ban, which was
adopted in 1992 to force Libya to turn over two suspects wanted for
the bombing of an Pan Am jet over Scotland in 1988.
	   Jerba, an island 350 kilometers (210 miles) south of the capital
Tunis, is frequently used as a transit point for travelers going on
to Libya by land without violating the sanctions.

Commonwealth chief says Ireland's return would be `natural

development' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ The secretary-general of the Commonwealth
predicted Wednesday that Ireland _ long proud of its hard-fought
independence from Britain _ would return to the fold.
	   Nigerian Chief Emeka Anyaoku, starting a four-day visit to the
capital of the Irish Republic, said it would be ``a very natural
development'' for Ireland to rejoin the Commonwealth, which binds
Britain with 53 of its past and present terrorities.
	   Ireland withdrew from the Commonwealth in 1948 when it declared
itself a republic, 26 years after negotiating independence from
Britain.
	   The idea of rejoining has gained momentum since the British and
Irish governments jointly oversaw April's peace accord in Northern
Ireland.
	   As part of that accord, the Irish government pledged to remove
the territorial claim to Northern Ireland contained in its 1937
constitution, but reaffirmed its desire to see the eventual
peaceful unfification of the island.
	   Political analysts have long considered rejoining the
Commonwealth a good way for the Irish Republic to make a further
gesture of reconciliation with Northern Ireland, which has a
British Protestant majority.
	   Anyaoku said Queen Elizabeth II's role as symbolic head of the
Commonwealth ``should not be overstated,'' since it didn't infringe
on any member's independence. He noted that many Commonwealth
members, like Ireland, have their own constitutions.
	   He added that Ireland, which is already enjoying the strongest
economic growth in Europe, could more easily build new trade and
commerce links with Commonwealth partners.

High prices hurt Brazilian coffee exports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilian coffee exports tumbled in
November, as high prices apparently scared off buyers, exporters
said Wednesday.
	   Exports last month fell to 1.67 million bags, down 18 percent
from October and the lowest since the crop year began in July, the
Brazilian Association of Coffee Exporters said.
	   Each bag contains 60 kilos (132 pounds) of coffee beans.
	   The slump ended a six-month streak of rising exports and
frustrated expectations that demand for Brazilian coffee would rise
after Hurricane Mitch ravaged Central America, a major
coffee-growing area, the association said.
	   Exporters blamed the decline on a price rise in late October and
early November.
	   Despite the drop, November exports still were 57 percent higher
than a year ago. Exports in the first eleven months totaled 14.92
million bags, compared to 13.46 million in the same period of 1997.
	   Even so, revenue fell to dlrs 2.13 billion from dlrs 2.55
billion a year earlier. The lower average prices were due in part
to a bumper coffee crop in Brazil.
	   The association is forecasting the largest coffee harvest of the
decade this year at 35.2 million bags. Brazil is the world's No.1
producer and exporter of coffee, and its main market is the United
States.

Spain insists Pinochet case is matter for courts

 &UR; With BC-Britain-Pinochet
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from gov't spokesman

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Britain's decision to allow Spanish
extradition proceedings against Gen. Augusto Pinochet met with
begrudging acceptance from the Spanish government Wednesday.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's government has made clear it
does not support Judge Baltasar Garzon's efforts to put the former
Chilean dictator on trial in Spain on charges of genocide,
terrorism and torture.
	   But Aznar has stated repeatedly since Pinochet was arrested in
London on Oct. 16 on a warrant from Garzon that the case was one
for the courts to decide and neither he nor his government would
interfere.
	   Spanish government spokesman Josep Pique reiterated this
Wednesday after the announcement in London by Home Secretary Jack
Straw that British courts will now process Garzon's extradition
request for Pinochet.
	   ``The government has always said, as far as Spain is concerned,
this case must remain strictly a judicial affair. It must not be
politicized,'' Pique told reporters.
	   The Aznar government has said that eight years after Pinochet
stepped down, Chile still has delicate political dynamics because
of deep divisions between supporters and critics of Pinochet, now
83.
	   Spain also has lucrative trade ties and major investments in
Chile, and Aznar is seen as eager to protect them.
	   However, the government, sticking to its official position,
reluctantly passed on Garzon's formal extradition request on Nov.
5.
	   Meanwhile human rights groups welcomed Straw's decision, which
sets the stage for months of legal wrangling in Britain as Pinochet
fights extradition.
	   ``We believe it is a coherent decision,'' said Francisco Perez,
a human rights activist who works for United Left, a political
party that had filed suit three years ago asking Judge Garzon to
charge Pinochet.
	   ``We think it is the best possible news on the 50th anniversary
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,'' Perez said.
	   ``Human rights cannot be just a matter of idle talk. The British
government and Judge Garzon are showing that one can fight against
impunity.''
	   Carlos Iriart, head of the Movement against Impunity, a key
anti-Pinochet group in Spain, said, ``we are not used to receiving
good news.''
	   Of Straw's decision, he added: ``It represents a new orientation
in international law that ends the impunity of those who have
committed human rights. Today we can say that a new era has
begun.''

Shell retakes control of export terminal in Nigeria

 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Shell retaking control of
terminal. No pickup. ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By GLENN McKENZIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Shell Oil retook control of a crude oil
export terminal Wednesday after youths had stormed the facility a
day earlier, an oil company official said.
	   Youths from the Ogulaga community in the southwestern Niger
River delta region stormed the Focades terminal on Tuesday, Shell
spokeswoman Olga Hart said. She did not say if they had caused any
damage to the terminal, which is located about 50 kilometers from
the southwestern city of Warri.
	   Workers at the terminal, the largest in the delta, were
evacuated but returned to the facility Wednesday, another Shell
official said on condition of anonymity. The standoff ended after
an ``interim arrangement'' was reached during talks between the
youths, local traditional chieftains and Shell employees, he said.
The terminal is expected to be operational again Thursday.
	   The youths were protesting because they said another oil
company, Mobil, had not fully paid a promised compensation package
after an enormous oil spill in January.
	   At least 1.6 million gallons leaked from a pipeline connecting
an offshore platform to a storage terminal in Nigeria's Akwa Ibom
state.
	   The Shell official said frustrated residents with no way to lash
out at Mobil had stormed the Shell facility instead _ hoping Shell
would in turn put pressure on Mobil.
	   Communities and youths in Nigeria's oil-rich delta region
regularly attack western oil firms, demanding they pay compensation
for environmental damage as a result of their operations there.
	   Nigeria is the world's sixth largest oil producer.

Ciba Specialty Chemicals, Clariant call off merger
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ A month after they announced they
would merge, Swiss firms Ciba Specialty Chemicals and Clariant said
Wednesday they have called off merger talks.
	   The merger, which would have formed the world's largest maker of
specialty chemicals and dyes, was intended to counter the global
downturn that has undermined their sales growth.
	   But Ciba and Clariant said closer examination revealed
commercial, financial, legal and regulatory risks and constraints
in executing the planned transaction which would affect the future
merged company.
	   The companies' boards ``considered the risks to be so
significant as to undermine the future benefits and synergies as
stated as part of the planned merger,'' they said in a statement.
	   The firms regret having to terminate the planned merger after a
period of ``constructive and open negotiations,'' the statement
added. Both companies agreed not to disclose confidential
information.
	   The fusion would have created a chemical group with sales of
around 18 billion Swiss francs (dlrs 12.9 billion) a year.
	   Some two years ago, the firms' parent corporations joined to
form chemicals giant Novartis.
	   The merged company was to retain the Clariant name, which was
given to the spin off from the Swiss drug group Sandoz AG in the
Novartis creation. The merger would have caused the demise of the
Ciba name, left over from former parent Ciba-Geigy AG.
	   Specialty chemicals are used to enhance the durability,
performance, color and feel of materials used to produce clothes,
packaging, household appliances, automobiles and other industrial
and consumer goods.

American textiles giant announces big Irish job cuts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUNCRANA, Ireland (AP) _ Fruit of the Loom Inc., facing pressure
to chop labor costs in its Irish T-shirt operations, announced 770
job cuts and the closure of three factories Wednesday.
	   The announcement confirmed the long-held fears of its more than
2,000 employees in County Donegal that the American textile giant _
the biggest employer in the Irish Republic's northernmost county _
couldn't reverse its operating losses and was on the way out.
	   Government agencies had offered Fruit of the Loom big grants and
other aid to encourage the manufacturer to the economically
deprived county in the 1980s. But comparatively high salaries have
made the company's Irish operations increasingly uneconomical.
	   The Kentucky-based company had already reduced the work week to
two days for all its employees, citing a backlog of unsold stock
across Europe, and earlier this week temporarily laid everyone off
over Christmas.
	   Wednesday's announcement didn't affect about 300 people employed
in Donegal's neighboring city of Londonderry in British-ruled
Northern Ireland, where Fruit of the Loom operates a high-tech yarn
plant in which wage costs are less of a factor.

Guatemalan archbishop says military responsible for bishop's death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Guatemala's archbishop is accusing the
military of killing a Roman Catholic bishop in April, saying the
act was retribution for a human rights report critical of the army.
	   Monsignor Prospero Penados told a Guatemala newspaper that the
military killed Bishop Juan Gerardi because of the report, in which
he said soldiers and pro-military death squads committed nearly 80
percent of the 200,000 killings and disappearances during
Guatemala's 36-year civil war.
	   ``They killed him for this rather than call for a dialogue,''
Penados was quoted as saying in Wednesday's edition of Siglo
Veintiuno.
	   Penados did not accuse anyone in particular.
	   The military's press office said it had no reaction to the
article.
	   Gerardi, 75, was bludgeoned to death in the garage of the
church's parish house two days after presenting the report on the
war, which ended two years ago.
	   Though suspicion immediately fell on soldiers or death squads,
police arrested a priest, Mario Najera Orantes, in July. The
archbishop said prosecutors have no reason to suspect Orantes.
	   ``They have not found any motive for this prisoner,'' the
newspaper quoted Penados as saying. ``There they have him and
Monsignor Gerardi is dead.''
	   Orantes has been under guard in a private hospital since last
week, suffering from an ulcer, pneumonia and stress. A Guatemalan
court has yet to decide whether to open judicial proceedings
against him.
	   The public prosecutor in charge of the case announced his
resignation last week, without giving a reason. His replacement has
not been named.

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Enraged by Israel's refusal to
release security prisoners, Palestinians stoned Israeli troops
Wednesday in the most widespread West Bank clashes in months. A
17-year-old stone mason was killed by Israeli gunfire and scores of
other Palestinians were injured.
	   The violence came despite U.S. appeals for calm and raised new
concerns that U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to the region
next week is triggering unrest, rather than reassuring Israelis and
Palestinians about their troubled peace accord, as intended.
	   On the outskirts of West Bank towns, thousands of Palestinians
hurled stones from slingshots at helmeted Israeli soldiers who
fired tear gas, live rounds and rubber-coated steel pellets.
	   In scences reminiscent of the 1987-1993 Palestinian uprising
which began exactly 11 years ago Wednesday, streets were littered
with rocks and overturned metal trash containers, and walls of
thick smoke from burning tires rose into the air.

'Alternative Nobel' recipients urge action
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Winners of this year's Right Livelihood
awards, the ``alternative Nobels,'' on Wednesday extolled the
effectiveness of individuals standing up against seeming monoliths
such as hatred and corporate exploitation.
	   ``Through not raising one's voice, this contributes to standing
up for and supporting a world in which too many people are killed.
While saying a loud 'no!' might at times look quite powerless, it
is still immensely more powerful than silence,'' Croatian peace
activist Vesna Terselic said in remarks prepared for delivery at
the awards ceremony.
	   Terselic and Katarina Kruhonja, another Croatian working for
post-war reconciliation, share one of this year's four awards. The
others went to cancer-prevention specialist Samuel Epstein, the
International Baby Food Action Network, and Juan Pablo Orrego, who
leads a campaign to prevent the damming of Chile's Bio Bio River.
	   The awards, each worth 450,000 kronor (dlrs 56,250), were
founded in 1980 by Jakob von Uexkull, a stamp dealer who sold his
collection to fund a program to recognize work that he believes
gets short shrift from the Nobel prizes.
	   ``In any rational society, their work would long ago have been
crowned with success ... but their struggles still go on,'' von
Uexkull said Wednesday.
	   The awards are presented in the Swedish Parliament, reflecting
the prestige the program has acquired.
	   Orrego, in his prepared remarks, made a call for two sorts of
action: working against ``the destructive pattern of growth of
urban-industrial societies,'' and undertaking the rigors of
spiritual exploration.
	   ``We need humility and a sort of rooted cosmic consciousness,
which is hard to find today,'' he said. ``We need to start by
including the non-huan in the 'us','' to understand the importance
of ecological concerns.
	   Ira Puspadewi of Indonesia, representing IBFAN, spoke of the
difficulty of encouraging breast-feeding in the face of infant
formula companies that have ``used every form of advertising
gimmick ... to persuade mothers, parents and health workers that
bottle-feeding is as good as or better than 'old-fashioned'
breast-feeding.''
	   Epstein, founder of the U.S. Cancer Prevention Coalition, was
critical both of companies that market carcinogenic chemicals, but
also of legal systems that don't punish the companies and of the
conventional anti-cancer strategies that focus on diagnosis and
treatment rather than on prevention.
	   ``I have reached the conclusion that the cancer establishment
bears a heavy burden of responsibility for losing the winnable war
against cancer,'' said Epstein, who is also director of the school
of public health at the University of Illinois-Chicago.
	   ``There is an overwhelming disparity between the full force of
criminal law and punishment directed at perpetrators of theft,
property damage or personal violence and the lenient civil
proceedings against ... industries that knowingly manipulate,
suppress or distort information on the ... hazards of their
processes,'' he said.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ The father of the 13-year-old heiress to
the Onassis shipping fortune was sentenced Wednesday to five years
in jail after being found guilty of slander and other charges
leveled by the trustees of the girl's estate.
	   Thierry Roussel filed an appeal and was not detained.
	   He was sued by the four Greek trustees for slander, perjury and
filing a false lawsuit after he lost a court case in which he
accused them of fiscal mismanagement.
	   The verdict ended a five-week trial, during which Roussel and
the trustees exchanged heated exchanges.
	   Athina Roussel, the granddaughter of the late shipping mogul
Aristotle Onassis, will inherit an estimated dlrs 600 million
fortune on her 18th birthday. Athina's mother, Christina Onassis,
died in 1988.
	   Athina lives in Switzerland with Roussel, his Swedish wife and
the couple's three children.
	   French-born Roussel and the trustees have been locked in a feud
over management of the estate. Roussel has failed in legal battles
in Greece to have the administration transferred to him.
	   A separate foundation manages the shipping and real estate
empire built by Onassis.

 &UR; European drug makers Zeneca and Astra confirm merger plans &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: AMS; RETRANSMITS to include other world points &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT SEELY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Swedish and British drug makers Astra and
Zeneca announced Wednesday that they would merge in a bid to take
on the leading U.S. and European pharmaceutical companies.
	   The new company, AstraZeneca, will be the third-biggest company
worldwide in its field, and Europe's No. 2 pharmaceutical company,
with combined 1998 drug sales of about dlrs 11.5 billion.
	   Sir David Barnes, deputy chairman of the new company, said that
the product mix, similar corporate cultures, and research and
development focus made the merger ``a good deal for both parties, a
good deal for the countries concerned, a good deal for
shareholders, and above all for patients.''
	   About 6,000 jobs _ 11 percent of the current combined workforce
of 54,000 _ will be eliminated, said Jon Symonds, finance director
of the new company. The losses will be spread throughout the world
over the next three years, he said.
	   AstraZeneca's corporate headquarters will be in London, with its
research and development headquarters in Sweden. The company will
be listed on the London, New York and Stockholm stock exchanges.
	   Tom McKillop, Zeneca's chief executive officer and the proposed
chief executive of the new company, said final merger documents are
expected by the end of the year and that he hoped for shareholder
and regulatory approval soon afterward.
	   ``I want AstraZeneca to be one of the world's great companies,''
McKillop said.
	   Last week, Germany's Hoechst and France's Rhone-Poulenc agreed
to merge their drug and agrochemical businesses as the first step
toward a total merger. In France, Sanofi and Synthelabo recently
announced their dlrs 10 billion merger.
	   Behind all these mergers is the need to increase research
spending to compete with giants such as Pfizer, Glaxo Wellcome and
Merck, and the desire to pool resources to boost marketing.
	   Astra and Zeneca, including non-pharmaceutical divisions, had
total 1997 sales of dlrs 15.9 billion, with pre-tax profit of dlrs
3.5 billion, the companies said. The combined market capitalization
was put at dlrs 67 billion. The companies said shares would be
merged on an equal-value basis.
	   Restructuring was projected to require three years' time and
cost about dlrs 1.2 billion, after which annual operating costs
would be lowered by about dlrs 1.1 billion.
	   ``Synergies are realistic and will be achieved, maybe even
exceeded,'' said Percy Barnevik, the proposed chairman of the
company. Barnevik currently heads Investor AB, the investment of
arm of Sweden's Wallenberg family, which owns 12 percent of Astra.
	   On the London Stock Exchange, Zeneca shares closed up 191 pence
(dlrs 3.05) at 2,711 pence (dlrs 43.37), while other pharmaceutical
companies' stocks also rose on speculation of further mergers.
Astra's shares rose by 12.9 percent, to 170.5 kronor (dlrs 21.21)
in trading on Stockholm's bourse.
	   Astra is best-known as the maker of Prilosec, an ulcer and
heartburn medication that is the world's best-selling prescription
drug. It comprises about half the company's total sales.
	   But the drug is scheduled to lose its patent protection in 2001,
opening the door for generic firms to make a less expensive copy
and slow the company's overall sales growth. Analysts speculated
that was a leading factor influencing the merger.
	   Astra, established in 1913, also makes lidocaine, a popular
local anesthesia.
	   Zeneca is the second-leading maker of cancer drugs behind
Bristol-Myers Squibb of the United States. It also has a large
agrochemical business and owns Salick Health Care, a U.S. operator
of cancer treatment and dialysis centers.
	   Last year, Zeneca introduced its migraine drug Zomig, and
earlier this year received clearance for a breast cancer drug. But
like Astra, Zeneca also has several cancer drugs expected to soon
lose their patent protection.

Russian intercepted after walking through the Channel Tunnel

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A man slipped past security cameras, barbed wire
and high fences and then walked 50 kilometers (30 miles) through
the undersea Channel Tunnel _ dodging high-speed trains _ from
Britain to France, where he was arrested Wednesday.
	   The 36-year-old Russian made the trek to France to try to join
the Foreign Legion, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency in
Moscow, dispelling the mystery about his motives.
	   A stunned Eurotunnel spokeswoman said the company is ``very
worried'' by the incident, the first time a pedestrian has ever
managed to dodge security and walk from Britain to France.
	   French police said the man, not identified by name, entered the
tunnel sometime over the weekend on the English side of the
Channel.
	   According to ITAR-Tass, the man is from Murmansk, works for the
Russian trading ship Polar Star and left England on Saturday.
	   His ship, the agency said, had arrived in Scotland in November.
But he decided to change careers, and hitchhiked across England to
make his way to France and the famed Foreign Legion.
	   He was detected and then arrested Wednesday while still inside
the tunnel as he prepared to surface at Coquelles, six kilometers
(four miles) west of Calais, where the trains emerge.
	   ``We are still asking ourselves how this man could have gotten
into the tunnel because it is under such great surveillance by
police and Eurotunnel security,'' said Dominique Maire, spokeswoman
for Eurotunnel in Paris.
	   The entrances to the tunnel on both sides of the Channel are
closely watched by TV cameras. Barbed wire and high fences have
been set up to keep trespassers out.
	   The tunnel was checked for damage after the incident and other
intruders, but nothing was found.
	   Inside the tunnel, the rails are very close together and trains
racing at speeds of up to 150 kilometers (92 miles) an hour whip up
winds that act like a vacuum cleaner and could scoop up a human
being.
	   French police said it was a miracle the man survived.
	   Eurotunnel believes the intruder sought safe refuge while trains
went by in cross passages, small openings that are placed every 375
meters (yards) inside the tunnel.
	   Police already have returned the man to England, his point of
departure, where he now is being interrogated by British
immigration officers ``to ascertain his immigration status,'' a
British Home Office spokeswoman said on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The Russian Embassy in London said it was aware of the incident
but had no comment.
	   Millions of people take the train each year through the Channel
Tunnel, which opened in 1994.

Seagram lowers earnings outlook for Universal

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Seagram Co. said Wednesday it will take an
earnings loss of dlrs 65 million because of the disappointing box
office performance at Universal Pictures, a unit of its Universal
Studios subsidiary.
	   The loss will be counted in the second quarter of the fiscal
year ending June 30. Film profits for the comparable quarter in
fiscal 1998 were $98 million.
	   Universal's recent box office disappointments have included
``Meet Joe Black'' and ``Babe: Pig in the City.''
	   Montreal-based Seagram is a liquor and entertainment giant which
owns film and music operations as well as its traditional spirits
and wine business.
	   Seagram reportedly is planning a major reorganization plan, when
it takes control of music giant PolyGram NV on Thursday. Seagram is
buying PolyGram in a dlrs 10.2-billion deal.

Little League World Series growing to 16 teams, two stadiums
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP GraphFacts &QL;

<TEXT>
	   WILLIAMSPORT, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Little League is getting
bigger.
	   In 2001, the Little League World Series will grow to 16 teams
competing over nine days in two stadiums as the baseball
championship of 11- and 12-year-olds expands for the first time
since 1947.
	   ``It is appropriate that as Little League Baseball continues
growing and expanding that more children be offered the opportunity
to participate in the Little League World Series,'' Stephen D.
Keener, president and chief executive officer of Little League
Baseball Inc., said Wednesday.
	   ``This is a pretty firm commitment to the area that we're
staying,'' Keener said.
	   Instead of four U.S. regional champions qualifying for the World
Series, eight will be crowned, representing the Northwest, West,
Midwest, Northeast, Mid-South, Southeast, Great Lakes and
Mid-Atlantic. Each region would include six to eight states,
according to a tentative blueprint.
	   Internationally, the national champions of Japan, Mexico and
Canada will go to Williamsport, plus the representatives from the
Far East (Asia), Central-South America and the Caribbean. Two
European teams will go: one made up of primarily native European
players and another composed of dependents from other nations, such
as the American children of Arab-American Oil Co. workers, who
often represent Saudi Arabia.
	   ``With all the other countries coming in, the possibility exists
that you might hear six or more languages being spoken at the 2001
Little League World Series,'' Keener said.
	   Under the new system, the 16 teams will compete in four pool
competitions, with the top two teams from each pool advancing to
the quarterfinals.
	   Currently, teams from four U.S. regions, Canada, Asia, Europe
and Latin America vie for the title in a week-long competition
every August. That format will stay in place for 1999 and 2000.
	   Construction will begin in 2000 on the new 5,000-seat stadium
just north of Howard J. Lamade Stadium.
	   The 10,000-seat Lamade Stadium, home to the World Series since
1959, will be renovated to include new rooms for series functions.

Russian intercepted after walking through the Channel Tunnel

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Russian news agency report saying man wanted to
join Foreign Legion, other info &QL;

	   PARIS (AP) _ A man slipped past security cameras, barbed wire
and high fences and then walked 50 kilometers (30 miles) through
the undersea Channel Tunnel _ dodging high-speed trains _ from
Britain to France, where he was arrested Wednesday.
	   The 36-year-old Russian made the trek to France to try to join
the Foreign Legion, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency in
Moscow, dispelling the mystery about his motives.
	   A stunned Eurotunnel spokeswoman said the company is ``very
worried'' by the incident, the first time a pedestrian has ever
managed to dodge security and walk from Britain to France.
	   French police said the man, not identified by name, entered the
tunnel sometime over the weekend on the English side of the
Channel.
	   According to ITAR-Tass, the man is from Murmansk, works for the
Russian trading ship Polar Star and left England on Saturday.
	   His ship, the agency said, had arrived in Scotland in November.
But he decided to change careers, and hitchhiked across England to
make his way to France and the famed Foreign Legion.
	   He was detected and then arrested Wednesday while still inside
the tunnel as he prepared to surface at Coquelles, six kilometers
(four miles) west of Calais, where the trains emerge.
	   ``We are still asking ourselves how this man could have gotten
into the tunnel because it is under such great surveillance by
police and Eurotunnel security,'' said Dominique Maire, spokeswoman
for Eurotunnel in Paris.
	   The entrances to the tunnel on both sides of the Channel are
closely watched by TV cameras. Barbed wire and high fences have
been set up to keep trespassers out.
	   The tunnel was checked for damage after the incident and other
intruders, but nothing was found.
	   Inside the tunnel, the rails are very close together and trains
racing at speeds of up to 150 kilometers (92 miles) an hour whip up
winds that act like a vacuum cleaner and could scoop up a human
being.
	   French police said it was a miracle the man survived.
	   Eurotunnel believes the intruder sought safe refuge while trains
went by in cross passages, small openings that are placed every 375
meters (yards) inside the tunnel.
	   Police already have returned the man to England, his point of
departure, where he now is being interrogated by British
immigration officers ``to ascertain his immigration status,'' a
British Home Office spokeswoman said on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   The Russian Embassy in London said it was aware of the incident
but had no comment.
	   Millions of people take the train each year through the Channel
Tunnel, which opened in 1994.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to ADD appointment of leftist as Interior Minister,
details on economic outlook, background on Chavez-Caldera meeting &QL; 
 &UR; By STEVEN GUTKIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ President-elect Hugo Chavez said
Wednesday he was ``completely sure'' Washington would reverse its
policy of banning him from the United States. Local stocks soared
after his election, he said, because ``we have demonstrated to the
world that we are not savages.''
	   The Caracas stock exchange opened sharply higher for the second
straight day Wednesday, continuing a rally caused by Chavez's
conciliatory statements after his landslide victory Sunday. The
market was up 11.4 percent Wednesday morning, following a record 22
percent hike the previous day.
	   Investors had long feared Chavez, who as an army officer in 1992
staged an unsuccessful coup attempt, would roll back free market
economic reforms and civil liberties. But his statements in the
last two days promising fiscal discipline and calling for national
reconciliation seem to have calmed investor fears.
	   On Wednesday, the president-elect appointed a 79-year-old
leftist politician named Luis Miquilena to oversee the national
police force as Interior Minister. It wasn't immediately clear if
that decision would affect the markets.
	   Chavez said he met earlier Wednesday with U.S. Ambassador John
Maisto, who he said delivered a letter of congratulations from U.S.
President Bill Clinton. Because of his earlier attempt to overthrow
the government, Chavez was placed on a U.S. list of alien
undesirables barred from entering the United States.
	   In recent days, U.S. officials have to moved to improve
relations with Chavez, whose country is the number one exporter of
oil to the United States.
	   ``I am completely sure that within a few weeks I will be in the
United States,'' Chavez said.
	   On Monday, State Department spokesman James Foley said that
heads of state normally receive a diplomatic visa to visit the
United States, adding, ``The U.S. government is prepared to take
the necessary steps to address any request for a visa that
President-elect Chavez may make.''
	   Chavez also met Wednesday morning with President Rafael Caldera
at the Miraflores presidential palace, the first time the former
lieutenant colonel had visited the site since storming it on Feb.
4, 1992 during the failed coup. Palace workers applauded and
cheered him.
	   Caldera, 82, was catapulted to the presidency partly because of
a speech he gave immediately after Chavez's coup, asking why people
would fight for democracy when it ``can't even give them enough to
eat.''
	   ``On the fourth of February two presidents were born,'' said
Chavez, who at 44 will be Venezuela's youngest president.
	   Speaking to reporters Wednesday after his meeting with Caldera,
Chavez said the stock market rally reflected Venezuelans' peaceful
vote for change.
	   ``There is a fresh breeze,'' he said. ``We have broken our
chains.''
	   During his press conference Wednesday, Chavez reiterated his
plans to root out corruption, review the country's oil policies and
call a constituent assembly to rewrite the constitution. Economists
say Chavez may have difficulty achieving his economic goals because
of a severe recession caused by slumping oil prices.
	   ``The country voted for transformation and now there is no
turning back,'' he said.

Russian woman kills infant, blames government

Supreme Court cancels army exemptions for rabbinical students

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a landmark decision which sent a jolt
through Israel's Orthodox Jewish community, Israel's Supreme Court
Wednesday ended a 50-year-old deal which gave thousands of
rabbinical students a ticket out of Israel's military draft.
	   Secular Jews, who serve up to three years mandatory service in
the army, hailed the decision. Orthodox lawmakers and officials
called for a national dialogue to bridge the deepening divide
between the two communities. Only the seminary students appeared
unconcerned.
	   Army exemptions for some 30,000 seminary students has been one
of Israel's touchiest social issues, a banner for the ongoing
conflict between secular and Orthodox Israelis and the role of
religion in a democracy.
	   Israeli men are drafted at the age of 18, serve three years in
the army, and return each year for up to 40 days of reserve duty
into their 40s. Women serve 20 months. By contrast, students in a
yeshiva _ a Jewish seminary _ are exempt from any kind of service
and are paid for study instead of work.
	   For secular Jews who put their lives on the line as soldiers in
Lebanon or the West Bank and then must pay full college tuition on
their own, the exemption has created years of anger and resentment
towards the minority Orthodox community.
	   Voting unanimously, an unusually large 11-member panel of
Israeli Supreme Court justices declared the mass exemptions
``illegal,'' and ordered Israel's parliament to approve a new
arrangement within one year.
	   Amnon Rubinstein, a liberal lawmaker who helped sponsored the
petition to the high court, was triumphant. ``Enough is enough,''
he declared. ``It's about time they realize that they can't go on
with this public scandal of discrimination against us, our sons,
our friends, and our friends' sons.''
	   When Israel's first prime minister, David Ben Gurion, agreed to
exempt yeshiva students in a conciliatory gesture towards the
then-tiny Orthodox community at the state's inception, the
arrangement applied to 600 students. Today about 30,000 Israeli men
have acquired deferments.
	   Abuse of the exemptions angers Israelis as much as the system
itself. Local reporters and state comptroller reports have
repeatedly found large numbers of ultra-Orthodox men working or
loitering instead of studying, as required by their draft
deferments.
	   Translating the court's decision into a draft of religious
students will be an almost impossible task because of the political
clout of the ultra-Orthodox parties in Israel's parliament.
	   Oren Avaraham, a 24-year-old yeshiva student in an
ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of Jerusalem brushed off Wednesday's
decision. ``It'll never happen,'' he said.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government
depends on the support of the ultra-Orthodox political parties who
will fight to keep the exemptions which brings both money and
students to their religious educational institutions.
	   Netanyahu pledged that during the year allocated by the Supreme
Court, he would work out a deal ``that will prevent a split in the
people.''
	   For Yaakov Amar, a 17-year-old religious student, the new
decision could have a greater impact. Most Israelis his age are
preparing for induction into the military but Amar has other plans.
``I hope to be an important rabbi in Israel,'' said the intense
youth, outside his yeshiva on a narrow, old street in Jerusalem.
``I wish the others well; I feel bad for every Israeli soldier who
dies in Lebanon, but my place is here,'' he emphasized.

U.N. team withdraws when refused entry to Baath Party office
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Iraqi official saying site was not ``sensitive,''
Butler trying to create crisis, description of the search, TRIMS
throughout. No pickup.
 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In a new challenge to the U.N. search for
illegal weapons in Iraq, a team of 12 inspectors was turned back
Wednesday when it tried to enter a major office of the ruling Baath
Party, a key site of Saddam Hussein's government.
	   Richard Butler, head of the U.N. Special Commission, which
oversees inspections, called the Iraqi action ``a blockage.''
	   ``This was an absolutely legal no-notice inspection and they
blocked us,'' he told The Associated Press in New York.
	   The inspectors withdrew after an Iraqi official demanded that
they first provide a written declaration ``on the material and
items'' they sought, the official Iraqi News Agency said.
	   Later Wednesday, however, an Iraqi official suggested the
standoff occurred because of a mistake by an Iraqi escort in
declaring the site sensitive.
	   The incident came two days after Butler announced that he was
ordering the resumption of the so-called surprise inspections. On
Tuesday, the inspectors visited 32 sites and on Wednesday, 10 more.
	   Iraq, which had suspended the inspections in August, allowed
them to resume only last month, averting a military strike by the
United States and Britain. The two countries have left an armada in
the Gulf to ensure Iraq abides by its promise to cooperate with
UNSCOM.
	   Wednesday's dispute elicited a cautious reaction from the United
States. David Leavy, a spokesman for the National Security Council,
said Washington awaits a report by Butler next week on Iraq's
overall compliance with U.N. requirements.
	   ``As the president has said, if UNSCOM cannot do its job
effectively, we remain poised to act,'' Leavy said. He declined to
say what would trigger U.S. military action.
	   UNSCOM must certify that Iraq has eliminated its chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons as well as long-range missiles
before U.N. economic sanctions can be lifted.
	   The sanctions, including an oil embargo, were imposed after the
1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and Iraqi officials have long
insisted they have eliminated all illegal weapons.
	   The latest disagreement was played out outside one of the four
branch headquarters of the Baath Party in the Baghdad neighborhood
of Adhamiya, near the Tigris River.
	   Oil Minister Amer Mohammed Rashid, a senior negotiator with U.N.
inspectors, said the team arrived Wednesday morning at the site,
which their escort declared as ``sensitive.''
	   The escort allowed four inspectors to enter briefly, Rashid
said. They came out and requested that a total of 12 inspectors be
allowed to enter.
	   ``This was refused by the Iraqi (escort),'' he said.
	   Rashid added that the escort was wrong in declaring the site
sensitive, which he said would include installations of the elite
Republican Guard and security services. He said the escort was
informed by higher Iraqi authorities that the site was not
sensitive.
	   Rashid, however, told a news conference that the inspectors are
deliberately seeking a confrontation.
	   He said Iraq did agree in a Feb. 23 agreement with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to allow surprise inspections. But, he
said, the United Nations also agreed ``to respect the security,
integrity and legitimate concerns of the Iraqi government,'' which
Rashid said included prior notice in visiting sites the government
considered sensitive.
	   U.N. inspectors have insisted that their searches should not be
restricted by the Iraqi government in any way.
	   Ewen Buchanan, the inspectors' spokesman in New York, said this
round of inspections, scheduled to end Monday, would continue. He
did not know whether inspectors would try to enter the site again.
	   As many as 140 inspectors on regular teams are working in Iraq
as well as some visiting experts, Caroline Cross, a U.N.
spokeswoman in Baghdad, said earlier. She said the number involved
was ``a little less than 200,'' or the entire contingent.
	   The Iraqi News Agency said seven teams visited 10 sites on
Wednesday. Inspectors used helicopters in one of the searches
outside Baghdad, it said quoting Gen. Hossam Mohammed Amin, who
heads an office that liaises with UNSCOM.
	   A team from the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is
responsible for inspections of Iraq's nuclear programs, also
arrived in Baghdad on Wednesday and met with Iraqi officials to
come up with a ``working schedule,'' Amin was quoted as saying.
	   Unannounced visits in the past have been a major source of
friction with Iraq, leading to three crises in the past year.

Britain gives go ahead for Pinochet extradition to Spain
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Saying Gen. Augusto Pinochet is fit enough to face
charges of genocide and torture, Britain on Wednesday allowed Spain
to start extraditing him, leaving the 83-year-old former dictator
to fight a long legal battle from a rented English mansion under
police guard.
	   Chile immediately announced the withdrawal of its ambassador in
protest as relations with Britain, a longtime ally, fell to a new
low.
	   In announcing his decision, Home Secretary Jack Straw rejected
complaints that a judge who swung a 3-2 court ruling against
Pinochet was biased because he heads the fundraising arm of the
human rights organization Amnesty International.
	   ``The Spanish request for his extradition will now be considered
by the courts,'' Straw said.
	   Bombarded by governments, lawyers, legislators, widows of
victims of Chilean police torture and widows of policemen slain by
leftists, Straw had agonized over the decision since Britain's
highest court, the House of Lords, ruled Nov. 25 that Pinochet has
no immunity from arrest under English law.
	   Pinochet, who has not been seen in public since his arrest Oct.
16 while recuperating from back surgery during a routine visit to
Britain, is scheduled to appear before a London magistrate Friday
afternoon.
	   Because of the expected crush of interest, court officials moved
the hearing _ routine under extradition law _ from central London
to Belmarsh Magistrate's Court, 10 miles (15 kms) from the center
of the capital.
	   Pinochet's lawyers may apply to a judge Thursday for an
emergency review of Straw's decision on the grounds that it is
wrong in law.
	   In Chile, amid the joy of his opponents and anger of supporters,
there was caution that the crisis could endanger the democracy
built on compromise since Pinochet stepped down in 1990 after 17
years in power _ armed with immunities from prosecution in his
native land.
	   Thus, the Chilean government wants Pinochet freed, although an
official Chilean report says 3,197 people were murdered or
disappeared at the hands of the secret police after he overthrew an
elected Marxist.
	   The extradition was instigated by a Spanish magistrate, Baltasar
Garzon, who has compiled _ with the help of human rights
organizations _ a detailed dossier against Pinochet.
	   Garzon initially cited 94 Spaniards among the victims as the
basis for the extradition, but since has broadened his warrant.
	   Rank-and-file legislators in the governing Labor Party hailed
Straw's decision. But the opposition Conservative Party accused
Prime Minister Tony Blair's government of affronting an ally in a
bid to demonstrate left-of-center credentials and a self-proclaimed
ethical foreign policy.
	   ``He had ample power to put an end to this shameful and damaging
episode,'' former Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher
said of Straw. ``This was a political decision and it represents a
failure of political leadership.''
	   Chile's departing ambassador, Mario Artaza, also said Straw had
political motives.
	   ``There were other factors involved _ it was more than just a
judicial decision,''' Artaza said before heading for London's
Gatwick Airport.
	   For human rights organizations, Straw's decision is a landmark
in what they hope is growing international consensus that crimes
against humanity, whether committed by Hutus in Rwanda or Serbs in
Bosnia, should be punished.
	   Amnesty International dubbed the British decision ``profoundly
uplifting,'' and the New York-based Human Rights Watch called it a
``tremendous birthday present'' for Thursday's 50th anniversary of
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
	   On Wednesday, police blocked the road leading to Pinochet's
mansion at Wentworth, an exclusive private estate overlooking a
championship golf course 20 miles (30 kms) west of London.

Cypriot women on hunger strike to mark Human Rights anniversary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ A group of 20 Greek Cypriot refugee women
began a three-day hunger strike Wednesday to protest Turkey's
refusal to allow them to return to their homes in northern Cyprus.
	   The strike came on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
	   To mark the occasion, President Glafcos Clerides urged U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan in a letter to ensure that Turkey
respects the rights of Greek Cypriot citizens.
	   It's tragic to observe the anniversary ``in the presence of
occupation troops'' that continue to ``forcibly divide'' the
island, Clerides said in the letter.
	   ``The people of Cyprus continue to rest their hopes in the
United Nations for the full restoration and safeguarding of their
human rights and fundamental freedoms,'' Clerides said.
	   Greek Cypriot political parties and refugee associations issued
similar statements as the refugee women began their hunger strike
in a tent next to a U.N. checkpoint on a fence that divides the
capital along with the rest of the country.
	   Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south and
a Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded and occupied its
northern third in 1974 in the wake of an abortive coup by
supporters of union with Greece. A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state
in the north is only recognized by Ankara which maintains 35,000
troops there.
	   The women strikers said in a statement that they are protesting
this way ``to remind the world of the continuing gross violations
of human rights by Turkey.''
	   The statement denounced the United Nations for its failure to
ensure implementation of its resolutions that call for the
reunification of the island and the return of 180,000 refugees to
their homes.
	   ``Those who tolerate and through their stand reward Turkey ...
have no right to talk about human rights,'' said the statement by
the Women's Association of Kyrenia. Kyrenia is a town in the
Turkish-occupied north.

 &UR; Romanian prime minister doesn't get support from unions

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Talks between Prime Minister Radu
Vasile and the country's main trade unions broke down Wednesday and
unions said they would stage street protests to show their
dissatisfaction at falling living standards.
	   Vasile met the leaders of several trade unions Wednesday to ask
them to hold off on organizing street protests for six months while
reforms are implemented, said Elena Marinescu, spokeswoman for the
Ministry of Industry and Trade.
	   After four hours of talks, union leader Dumitru Costin said the
government lacked credibility with labor and its proposed reforms
would mean delayed wages, unpaid bills and no bonuses, national
agency Rompres reported.
	   His union members will march through the capital and the city of
Brasov Thursday to underscore their discontent.
	   Costin heads the National Trade Union Bloc which has 600,000
members. Earlier, Marin Condescu, leader of the Miners Unions
Confederation, said that government reforms were merely
``gift-wrapped promises.''

Swiss concession over wine with famous name eases Europe accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with Swiss saying agreement reached, concession on
wine name. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland gave way Wednesday over the
famous name of a still wine from a small lakeside village, easing
the country closer to agreement in tough negotiations with the
European Union.
	   At issue was French displeasure over Swiss winemakers' use of
the prestigious Champagne name for their unbubbly white, which
sells around 50,000 bottles each year.
	   But the Swiss vintners protested that they are only following
the Swiss practice of naming their wine after their village, which
has been called Champagne, with variations on the spelling, since
the earliest documents in 885 A.D.
	   Swiss Champagners, who tend their vines above Lake Neuchatel in
Western Switzerland, have been making wine since the 10th century.
The French region began producing its famous sparkling wine at the
end of the 17th century.
	   After an overnight session with EU representatives in Brussels
became snagged on the Champagne issue, the Swiss agreed the name
must disappear from the labels of the Swiss wine, following a
transitional period of two years.
	   Last week, the EU and Switzerland struck a deal on transport,
concluding four years of tough negotiations.
	   The agreement cleared the way for the wider agreement covering
areas like air transport and labor.
	   The French say the Champagne name can only be used for the
famous sparkling white wine made in the Champagne region of France,
and held out against the bilateral trade agreements with
Switzerland.
	   Senior Swiss foreign ministry official Jakob Kellenberger told
reporters in Bern ``wide-ranging agreement'' had been reached,
subject to the approval by Thursday of the EU's 15 members.
	   Some technical issues have yet to be resolved, he added. The
agreement faces a long ratification process.
	   ``We can see the end of the tunnel but the European locomotive
hasn't yet arrived,'' Swiss government spokesman Achille Casanova
said.
	   The Swiss electorate voted six years ago against joining a loose
European free trade grouping.
	   Fearing another snub at the ballot box, the government has
frozen an application to join the more closely knit 15-nation EU
trade bloc, which now surrounds the country, and has concentrated
on the bilateral deals.
	   The villagers of Champagne themselves were resigned to losing
their right to use the name.
	   ``If the Swiss confederation gives in, it will have to look at
financial compensation,'' vineyard manager Albert Banderet was
quoted as saying in the daily Le Matin newspaper.

Chief inspector accuses Iraq of blocking legitimate inspection
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Butler speaking to U.N. secretary-general;
comments from Iraqi deputy ambassador, U.N. and UNSCOM spokesmen &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard
Butler accused Iraq on Wednesday of blocking a completely
legitimate inspection after promising unhindered access and full
cooperation.
	   ``This was an absolutely legal no-notice inspection and they
blocked us,'' he told The Associated Press. ``It was a blockage and
it's wrong.''
	   Despite the Iraqi interference, Butler plans to continue the
surprise searches, which began Tuesday and are expected to conclude
late this week or early next week, said U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard.
	   Butler said Monday he wanted to complete a series of tests of
Iraq's compliance before reporting to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan on whether Baghdad has kept its promise of full cooperation
with inspectors in the search for banned weapons.
	   ``He has told us that he will not make an assessment of overall
Iraqi compliance on the basis of a single incident, and he expects
to give his final report on that assessment early next week,''
Eckhard said.
	   State-run Iraqi radio disclosed the incident, saying a U.N.
weapons team tried to get into an office of President Saddam
Hussein's ruling Baath party Tuesday ``in a provocative manner ...
without previous announcement.''
	   The party official in charge demanded that the head of the U.N.
team give him a written declaration ``on the banned items'' the
team was seeking, according to the broadcast, which quoted the
official Iraqi News Agency. ``The team rejected this and
withdrew,'' it said.
	   Iraq's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Saeed Hasan said the building was
the headquarters of the Baghdad branch of the Baath party, which he
called ``a sensitive site.''
	   The Iraqis in the past have tried to block or thwart some
unannounced inspections, calling them provocative and an
infringement of sovereignty.
	   The U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, which Butler
heads, and the International Atomic Energy Agency must certify that
Baghdad has eliminated banned weapons before the Security Council
can lift sweeping economic sanctions imposed in 1990 after Iraq
invaded Kuwait.
	   Butler said Iraq's demand for ``notice from us in writing of
what we were looking for ... is simply wrong.''
	   ``Three weeks ago they solemnly promised the Security Council
that they would cooperate. And now this new requirement that we
tell them in advance in writing what we're looking for _ this is
nonsense,'' he said.
	   ``We have done inspections like this before,'' said UNSCOM
spokesman Ewen Buchanan. ``You can't have a credible verification
inspection regime if there are chunks off bounds.''
	   The Security Council met Wednesday morning but did not discuss
Iraq. Eckhard said Butler had not been asked by the council to
report on the incident.
	   Butler did speak to Annan about the incident Wednesday morning.
``The secretary-general has no public reaction at this time,''
Eckhard said.
	   Annan will report to the Security Council on Butler's findings
on Iraqi compliance.
	   The council must decide that Iraq is in full cooperation with
inspectors before it will undertake a comprehensive review of
Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions.
	   Iraqi leaders see the review as the quickest route to easing or
lifting economic sanctions but diplomats say it will merely
establish a list of Baghdad's outstanding obligations _ and the
United States insists there is no link to ending sanctions.

U.S. envoy insists Kosovo negotiations `still on track'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to UPDATE with Chirac, Rugova comments in Paris &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVE CARPENTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The top U.S. envoy for Kosovo
insisted Wednesday that diplomacy aimed at resolving the conflict
is ``still on track'' despite rejection by all sides of the latest
peace proposal.
	   Christopher Hill spoke after launching a new round of shuttle
talks in the turbulent province, where the ethnic Albanian majority
and Serbian authorities have refused to budge from their main
demands.
	   An October truce that halted months of combat between separatist
rebels and Serb forces is largely holding. But many expect fighting
to resume by spring if a political settlement is not reached.
	   Frequent shooting incidents have marred the shaky peace _ the
latest a report of attacks by gunmen on two Serb police patrols
Wednesday that injured two policeman.
	   Hill, returning to the region from Washington, met for several
hours with ethnic Albanian negotiators in Pristina. He planned to
meet later with a political representative of the Kosovo Liberation
Army.
	   He has scheduled talks Thursday in Belgrade with the Serbian
side, which formally rejected the latest U.S. draft on Wednesday.
	   ``We believe that our negotiations are still on track,'' Hill,
who also is U.S. ambassador to neighboring Macedonia, told
reporters.
	   ``Ultimately the responsibility of reaching a settlement rests
with both sides,'' he said. ``They need to find ways to
compromise.''
	   Both Hill and Wolfgang Petritsch, the European Union envoy for
Kosovo, who joined in the talks, cited the urgency of trying to
reach a settlement soon in order to head off new fighting.
Petritsch expressed optimism that ``something should be achieved in
the next couple of weeks.''
	   ``This is a very decisive point in time,'' he said. ``We mustn't
lose the momentum.''
	   Based on their public statements, the gulf between the sides
appears huge. Hill admitted that ``it's not an easy process.''
	   The ethnic Albanian officials insist on a solution that would
break away Kosovo from Serbia, while the KLA has said it won't
accept anything short of outright independence.
	   In Paris, French President Jacques Chirac told Kosovo's leading
ethnic Albanian politician, Ibrahim Rugova, of France's concern
over the ``absence of political will'' on both sides to resolve the
crisis.
	   A French official, briefing reporters on condition he not be
named, said Chirac said the two sides should begin talks without
delay on the future of the province.
	   ``I hope that with the efforts of the United States, the
European Union and also France ... that we will arrive at
something,'' Rugova told reporters after the 45-minute meeting.
	   Senior Serbian officials, including President Milan Milutinovic,
formally rejected the latest Hill plan Wednesday, reiterating
support for a Serb draft which keeps the province firmly within the
republic.
	   They did not elaborate in a statement issued by the official
Tanjug news agency. But a day earlier, Serbian negotiator Ratko
Markovic said the U.S. draft would require ``reconstructing the
whole of Yugoslavia'' and lead to independence for Kosovo.
	   Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians comprise about 90 percent of a
population of 2 million, had autonomy until then-Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic revoked it in 1989.
	   After KLA rebels began attacking the police forces that maintain
a massive presence in the province, Serbian forces launched a
crackdown last February that killed hundreds of people and uprooted
an estimated 300,000 from their homes.
	   Periodic violence has continued. The pro-government Serb Media
Center said groups of armed Albanian gunmen attacked police patrols
Wednesday afternoon near Dolovo village in western Kosovo and
Opterusa in the southwest.
	   Two policemen were reported hospitalized as a result of the
Dolovo attack, including one with serious injuries.

Chechen leader says hostages killed while rescue was in works
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with comment from sister of hostage in new grafs
9-11. &QL; 
 &UR; By RUSLAN MUSAYEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechen police were searching Wednesday
for the bodies of four kidnapped foreigners who were beheaded
during a botched attempt to free them.
	   The deaths _ and the ostentatious display of the heads by
killers _ prompted neighboring Russian regions to close off roads
into Chechnya, and caused an outpouring of outrage and lament from
Russian and foreign officials.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said Wednesday that one
alleged kidnapper had been arrested and authorities gleaned enough
information to launch a rescue operation for the hostages, three
Britons and a New Zealander.
	   But during the rescue attempt the kidnappers panicked and
decapitated the captives, Maskhadov said, according to Russian

	   ``A concrete criminal group was identified, an organizer of the
abductions was arrested and an approximate location of the hostages
was determined,'' Maskhadov said in a statement.
	   The severed heads of the four men were found lined up along a
highway Tuesday outside Chechnya's capital Grozny, and hundreds of
Chechen law enforcement officers were searching for the bodies
Wednesday.
	   ``We will take all necessary steps to solve this horrible
crime,'' said Maskhadov, who has been unable to restore law and
order in Chechnya since being elected last year.
	   The victims _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf
Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw _ were identified by their
former bodyguard. They had been abducted by unidentified gunmen
Oct. 3 in Grozny.
	   ``He was just making a career for himself,'' Hickey's sister
Deborah, 21, said Wednesday, fighting back tears. ``He was
fantastic with electrics and all that sort of stuff.''
	   The family had expected 26-year-old Hickey to be back at his
parents' pub in Thames Ditton, England, by Christmas.
	   ``Everything was going right, everyone was very optimistic''
that the hostages would be rescued, she told Britain's ITV. ``The
people that have done this to him, they deserve exactly the same
back.''

	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechen police were searching Wednesday
for the bodies of four kidnapped foreigners who were beheaded
during a botched attempt to free them.
	   The deaths _ and the ostentatious display of the heads by
killers _ prompted neighboring Russian regions to close off roads
into Chechnya, and caused an outpouring of outrage and lament from
Russian and foreign officials.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said Wednesday that one
alleged kidnapper had been arrested and authorities gleaned enough
information to launch a rescue operation for the hostages, three
Britons and a New Zealander.
	   But during the rescue attempt the kidnappers panicked and
decapitated the captives, Maskhadov said, according to Russian
media reports.
	   ``A concrete criminal group was identified, an organizer of the
abductions was arrested and an approximate location of the hostages
was determined,'' Maskhadov said in a statement.
	   The severed heads of the four men were found lined up along a

Lithuanian court declares death penalty unconstitutional
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) - Lithuania's highest court on Wednesday
declared the country's Soviet-era death penalty unconstitutional,
saying it violated provisions against cruelty and torture, the
Baltic News Service reported.
	   The death penalty has wide backing in Lithuania, with some 80
percent of respondents in a recent poll saying they supported
capital punishment. But the law has been criticized by European
human rights groups and the European Union has said it was an
obstacle to Lithuanian membership.
	   Like virtually all other former Soviet republics, Lithuania kept
its death penalty after independence. It hasn't carried out a death
sentence since 1995, but capital punishment has remained on the
books.
	   Wednesday ruling does not immediately abolish the death penalty,
but it should preclude parliament from including the capital
punishment in a new criminal code now being considered by
parliament, BNS said.
	   President Valdas Adamkus, one of the few Lithuanian politicians
who has spoken out against capital punishment, welcomed the high
court's ruling. But Stanislovas Buskevicius, a right-wing
legislator, warned that violent crime was bound to increase without
the death penalty.
	   ``Today is a victory for assassins,'' BNS quoted him as saying.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The bitter feud that threatens to split the
far-right National Front reached new heights Wednesday when party
leader Jean-Marie Le Pen dismissed his ambitious heir apparent,
Bruno Megret, accusing him of inciting rebellion in party ranks.
	   Le Pen's move came only two hours after Megret broke his silence
of the past week to defy his boss and demand an emergency party
congress to solve their differences.
	   That demand, Le Pen said, was divisive, inflammatory, and ``a
crime against the National Front as well as a crime against
France.''
	   The rapid-fire events heralded a drawn-out showdown between the
two men _ sure to please opponents of a party that is widely seen
as racist and anti-Semitic, but consistently draws 15 percent of
French voters.
	   Le Pen, 70, has been the absolute leader of the party for a
quarter-century. But his increasingly public struggle with the
quieter and more pragmatic _ though no less ideological _ Megret
has weakened his hand.
	   At a packed news conference Wednesday, Megret said the party
``belongs to no one person. It belongs to the militants, all the
militants.''
	   ``I will never leave the National Front, neither by resigning
nor by being pushed out,'' Megret said.
	   He demanded an urgent meeting in January of the party's 50,000
or so members nationwide _ a demand that Le Pen termed an effort
``to destabilize the movement.''
	   He named Carl Lang, the party's vice-president, as a
replacement.

 &UR; Ethnic Albanian leader warns of disaster in case of escalation &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova on Wednesday
expressed fear of a ``mass ethnic purification'' if the situation
in Kosovo escalates.
	   But Rugova, who had a 45-minute meeting with President Jacques
Chirac, also expressed hope that the worst would not come to pass.
	   The cease-fire is ``very fragile,'' he told reporters after the
meeting, but ``I hope that with the efforts of the United States,
the European Union, France also ... we'll reach something.''
	   However, Rugova, in Paris for 50th anniversary celebrations of
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, said that ``if there is
an escalation of the situation, that will signify the biggest
massacre seen to date and I fear -- this is not a phobia -- that we
could have a mass ethnic purification.''
	   He called for ``great attention'' to the situation from the
international community.
	   Chirac, in his talks with Rugova, underscored the need to
``start discussions without delay'' and warned against a wait which
extremists ``could profit from to restart the combat.''
	   Chirac's discussion was conveyed by sources at the presidential
Elysee Palace, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's Serb republic, with a
majority ethnic Albanian population, is seeking independence.
	   The October peace accord was seen as a way to buy time for a
diplomatic solution acceptable to both Serbs and ethnic Albanians.
But fears are mounting that full-scale fighting could erupt,
perhaps in the spring.

Libya warns against making Lockerbie suspects political scapegoats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ Libya's justice minister on Wednesday said
the two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner should
not become victims of Western politics when they go on trial.
	   ``We want to be sure that the only aim of the trial is to show
the truth ... and that it is held without a political or security
background,'' Justice Minister Mohammed Belgasim al-Zuwiy said.
	   He was addressing the General People's Congress, or Parliament,
which opened a debate that will decide the fate of the two men who
are wanted in connection with the Dec. 21, 1988 bombing. A total of
270 people on board and on ground were killed when the jetliner
blew up over the Scottish town of Lockerbie.
	   Libya has accepted in principle to a trial before a panel of
Scottish judges in the Netherlands. But the hand over of the
suspects has been held up over Libya's demand for a guarantee that
the two men, if convicted, will be jailed in Libya.
	   The United States and Britain insist that the two suspects serve
their prison term in Britain.
	   The Parliament meeting, expected to last five days, is being
held in the northern coastal town of Sirte and was broadcast live
on national television.
	   Libyan media have suggested that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi
does not have the authority to hand over the suspects and that any
decision would have to be approved by the Congress.
	   ``Our argument is that since this is an exceptional trial,
therefore this exception should include serving the jail term in
Libya, maybe under U.N. supervision,'' al-Zuwiy said.
	   He said Libya is seeking the guarantees from the West to ensure
that the trial will be ``honest, just .. and without loopholes that
(would) leave our citizens in illegal, unjust and inappropriate
circumstances.''
	   Opening the debate, Foreign Minister Omar al-Muntasser gave the
background to the controversy since the Security Council imposed
sanctions on Libya in 1992 to force it to hand over the Lockerbie
suspects for trial.
	   The sanctions include a ban on air travel from and to Libya,
restricting diplomatic personnel and banning the purchase of oil
equipment.
	   Al-Zuwiy, the justice minister, said the two suspects will have
the right to an appeal in the same court if it finds them guilty.
	   On Saturday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan met with Gadhafi
to iron out the details. No agreement was reached but Annan said
Libya is expected to reach a decision soon.

Oil minister: Spare parts can boost exports by 700,000 bpd
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq can increase its oil exports by more
than 700,000 barrels a day if it gets the badly needed spare parts,
the oil minister said Wednesday.
	   Iraq currently exports 1.8 million barrels of oil a day and Oil
Minister Amer Mohammed said that amount would increase to more than
2.5 million barrels if Baghdad could get the dlrs 300 million
dollars worth of spare parts approved by the United Nations for its
ailing oil industry.
	   The latest shipment arrived Nov. 25 and included material for
the treatment of crude oil and removal of impurities.
	   An acute shortage of spare parts has caused the quality of Iraqi
crude to plunge.
	   Mohammed blamed the U.S. representative on the U.N. sanctions
committee for blocking the approval of the spare parts.
	   ``He always blocks and puts contracts on hold,'' Mohammed told a
news conference.
	   The accusation echoes similar Iraqi complaints in the past that
the United States and Britain deliberately hold up contracts for
most items, a charge the two countries deny.
	   Iraq was banned from selling oil freely under U.N. sanctions
imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Under a U.N.
oil-for-food deal, Iraq is allowed to sell limited quantities of
oil to buy food, medicines and other humanitarian goods since
December 1996.
	   Mohammed said Iraq has signed 42 oil contracts since the fifth
phase of the oil-for-food deal began early this month.

Commission: Government should pay compensation for post-war
</HEADLINE>
insensitivity to Jews

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The government should pay 48
million guilders (dlrs 25 million) to Dutch Jewish organizations as
compensation for its insensitive treatment of Holocaust survivors
after World War II, an independent commission said in a report
published Wednesday.
	   During the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands, Jews were forced
to pay for the construction of two camps where they were held
before being deported to death camps like Auschwitz and
Bergen-Belsen. After the war, the government repaid only a fraction
of the money.
	   ``The (Dutch) camps ... were the gateways to camps like
Auschwitz,'' said commission leader Frans Kordes. ``This must be
put right.''
	   Jews also had to pay for the return of their stolen belongings
from Germany, Kordes said as he presented his report to Dutch
Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm.
	   After the war ``there was not enough feeling shown for what
these people had been through,'' Kordes said. His report described
the treatment of returning Jews as ``inhumane.''
	   Zalm had no immediate comment on the sums of money involved,
Dutch television news reported.
	   A prominent Dutch Jewish group criticized the proposals for not
going far enough.
	   ``The problem is that individual claims are considered no longer
valid,'' said Ronny Naftaniel, a spokesman for the Center for
Information and Documentation on Israel.
	   About three-quarters of Dutch Jews _ more than 100,000 people _
died in the Holocaust.

Hamas spiritual leader joins prisoners' hunger strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The spiritual leader of the Islamic militant
group Hamas joined hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in a hunger
strike Wednesday for their release.
	   The elderly wheel-chair bound Sheik Ahmed Yassin was put under
house arrest by Palestinian police in October.
	   Hamas spokesman Ismael Hania said Yassin would refuse food in
solidarity with Palestinians prisoners striking in Israeli jails
since last week. Hania visited Yassin in his Gaza home Tuesday.
	   Palestinians have held wide-spread demonstrations and strikes
throughout the West Bank to protest Israel's refusal to release
so-called security prisoners, those jailed for militant or
political acts against the Jewish state.
	   Israel has said that as part of the latest Mideast peace accord,
it is only bound to release 750 prisoners and will not release
those with ``blood on their hands.''

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Two masked men supported by some 150 Libyan
passengers took over a chartered Egyptian airliner in mid-air
Wednesday, demanding to be flown to Libya in violation of U.N.
sanctions.
	   The pilot, however, landed the plane in the Tunisian resort town
of Jerba where the protesters got off. But Tunisian authorities put
the passengers back on board and the aircraft flew to Cairo and
then on to Yemen from where it had taken off.
	   Security forces surrounded the plane at the Cairo airport, and
reporters there did not see any passenger getting off. After
refueling, the plane took off for San`a, the Yemeni capital, with
the passengers.

 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with teacher coming forward in TV
interview, Vatican newspaper calling violence unjustified. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Education officials on Wednesday suspended a
small-town teacher who kicked a 12-year-old pupil hard enough to
force removal of the boy's spleen.
	   The Dec. 3 incident at the middle school in Monterotondo,
outside Rome, became public only this week, making front-page
headlines Wednesday and drawing condemnation from the Vatican's
Osservatore Romano.
	   Enrico Landi, 45, kicked the boy as he stood in a line with his
classmates. The child later fainted and was taken to a hospital,
where doctors removed his damaged spleen.
	   The teacher said he had meant it only to be a light blow, but
said the child turned abruptly and took the full force of the blow.
	   ``It happened accidentally,'' Landi said, appearing on RAI state
television Wednesday almost in tears. ``It was a 1-in-1 million
thing. The important thing is that the boy's OK now.''
	   Colleagues defended the teacher, calling him an even-tempered
man who was a friend to his pupils.
	   ``It was a freak accident, even though it shouldn't have
happened,'' said the school's vice principal, Maria Grazia
Ricciotti.
	   The Vatican newspaper condemned the action, saying it was
unacceptable for a teacher to hit a pupil. ``It seems a resurgence
of archaic villainy, surfacing in absurd violence,'' Osservatore
Romano said.
	   Education authorities in Rome suspended the teacher pending the
outcome of a criminal investigation.

	   CALAIS, France (AP) _ People have swam the English Channel
before. Now someone has walked from England to France.
	   A 36-year-old Russian sailor was detained Wednesday in the
Channel Tunnel near where trains emerge on the French side. He
entered the 30-mile undersea tunnel over the weekend on the English
side, police said.
	   Police were still trying to figure out how he was able to avoid
detection by surveillance cameras and get past high fences and
barbed wire. But the real miracle, they said, was that he was still
alive.
	   The tunnel is supposed to be only for high-speed trains that
whiz up to 92 mph through the tunnel dozens of times a day,
whipping up winds that can suck up objects, even a human being.
	   The company that runs the tunnel believes the intruder survived
by taking refuge in small openings in the wall every 410 yards.
	   ``We are still asking ourselves how this man could have gotten
into the tunnel,'' said Dominique Maire, spokeswoman for Eurotunnel
in Paris.
	   The company is ``very worried'' by the incident, the first time
a pedestrian has used the channel, she said, adding ``we will be
very interested in knowing why.''
	   The man, who was not identified by name, wanted to join the
French Foreign Legion, the ITAR-Tass news agency in Moscow said.
	   ITAR-Tass said the man arrived in Scotland in November on the
Russian trading ship Polar Star, then hitchhiked across England to
make his way to France and the famed fighting force.
	   The man, who was not identified by name, was detected as he
prepared to surface at Coquelles, four miles west of the French
port of Calais.
	   French police returned the man to England, where he was being
questioned by immigration officers, the British Home Office said.
	   Millions of people take the train each year through the Channel
Tunnel, which opened in 1994.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Russia, the superpower emeritus of
Europe, warned NATO Wednesday that as the alliance develops its new
military and political strategy for the 21st century, it must
recognize that the ultimate authority for military action beyond
NATO borders is the United Nations.
	   ``The main decision-making body remains the United Nations,''
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said at a news conference
after a meeting of the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council. ``NATO
should keep this in mind while discussing its strategic concept.''
	   Ivanov spoke after NATO foreign ministers met Tuesday to discuss
updating the political and military principles that guide the
alliance.
	   He said that since the creation of the joint council in 1996,
the former enemies have made great progress in dealing with their
differences and finding areas for cooperation. But he made no
secret that serious differences remain.
	   For its part, NATO believes that continuing to cooperate despite
these differences is proof of the council's success. ``Kosovo is a
good example of that,'' NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said,
referring to the Serbian province in Yugoslavia where ethnic
Albanians are fighting for independence.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who told the allies
that Bosnia and Kosovo are prime examples of the kind of threats
that had to be faced outside NATO's borders, said it is only common
sense to deal with instability before it lands on the alliance's
doorstep.
	   The Russians vehemently disagreed with NATO's decision to
threaten air strikes in Kosovo without a specific mandate from the
United Nations. At the same time, however, they continued to work
with western countries to achieve a political solution and are
contributing to a task force of unarmed civilians who are now
patrolling the Serbian province and monitoring the cease-fire.
	   The Russians fear that NATO will effectively circumvent Russia's
veto on the U.N. Security Council. And, they wonder, if the world
has abandoned the principle of non-interference in the internal
affairs of countries, what standards will be used and who will
apply them?
	   Several ministers tried to explain to Ivanov the reasoning
behind NATO's action in Kosovo and allay Russia's concerns. They
said there was no attempt to circumvent the United Nations, but
that when the U.N. route became blocked, NATO had no choice but to
act to avert a humanitarian disaster.
	   In Tuesday's meeting, foreign ministers began updating NATO's
strategic concept, which in recent years turned away from defense
against a Soviet onslaught in Central Europe to regional conflicts,
ethnic violence, terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.
	   Russia is watching this process closely.
	   ``We cannot be indifferent to the plans and decisions taken by
NATO,'' said Ivanov. ``We've described our point of view on some
points that are being discussed now.''
	   He was adamant about the role of the United Nations.
	   NATO continues to keep its forces on alert for intervention in
Kosovo should Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic abandon the
cease-fire.
	   ``Today, there is no threat of humanitarian catastrophe in
Kosovo,'' Ivanov said. ``As to (the NATO forces), our position has
not changed. The question now is in the dimension of political
negotiations.''
	   Earlier in the day Ivanov held separate talks with Albright.
	   At a news conference, Albright said the two had gone over
several bilateral issues, including Russia's cooperation with Iran
and the START II nuclear disarmament treaty.
	   Russia's Communist-led parliament long has delayed ratification
of START II treaty, signed by the United States and Russia in 1993.
The treaty would halve their nuclear arsenals to about 3,000 to
3,500 warheads each.
	   Albright said the Russian minister had told her he expects the
Russian parliament to ratify START II by the end of December. The
U.S. Senate ratified the treaty in 1996.
	   ``I'm hoping that when I'm in Moscow at the end of January we
can begin the Start III talks,'' she said.

Spacewalking astronauts go back out to install antennas
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Spacewalk scheduled to last until 10 or 11 p.m. EST. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARCIA DUNN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Aerospace Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ Two astronauts ventured back out on
another spacewalk Wednesday to attach antennas to the international
space station under construction nearly 250 miles above Earth.
	   For the second time this week, Jerry Ross and James Newman
floated out the hatch of the shuttle Endeavour to work on the
seven-story, 35-ton station taking shape in the open cargo bay.
	   Their No. 1 priority was to attach two 100-pound antennas to
Unity, the American-made side of the space station. Their other
job, time permitting, was trickier: trying to open a stuck antenna
on Zarya, the Russian-built control module.
	   The planned seven-hour spacewalk was not nearly as difficult or
crucial as Monday night's outing, during which Ross and Newman
hooked up 40 electrical connections between Zarya and Unity.
	   The plan called for the men to lug two suitcase-size antennas
about halfway up Unity and install them on opposite sides of the
36-foot cylinder.
	   Once activated, the antennas will provide a direct, virtually
uninterrupted communication link between Unity and NASA's Mission
Control. Otherwise, U.S. flight controllers would have to rely on
the sporadic coverage provided by Russian ground stations.
	   The electronic and computer hookups for the antennas will be
made inside Unity on Thursday, after the entire crew enters the
orbiting station for the first time.
	   Other spacewalking chores for Ross and Newman on Wednesday
evening included erecting a sunshade over a computer mounted to the
outside of Unity.
	   Mission Control decided just before the spacewalk to let Newman
take a crack at unjamming the Zarya antenna.
	   Flight controllers urged caution. The antenna was rolled up on a
spool, and engineers worried the 3-foot strip might pop open with
enough force to hurt him if he got too close. Newman had a 10-foot
grappling hook for the job.
	   The antenna is one of two that failed to open properly following
Zarya's Nov. 20 launch from Kazakstan.
	   One more spacewalk is planned for Endeavour's 12-day mission: On
Saturday, Ross and Newman will conduct a photo survey and take out
a sack of tools that will be used by future station visitors.
Newman also may try to unjam the other Zarya antenna.
	   This was the sixth spacewalk for Ross during his 18-year NASA
career, the most by an American, and the third for Newman.

U.S. envoy insists Kosovo negotiations `still on track'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVE CARPENTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Diplomacy aimed at resolving the
conflict in Kosovo is ``still on track,'' the top U.S. envoy for
the troubled province insisted Wednesday _ even though all sides in
the dispute had rejected his latest peace proposal.
	   Christopher Hill spoke after launching a new round of shuttle
talks in the turbulent province, where the ethnic Albanian majority
seeks independence from Serbian rule.
	   An October truce that halted months of combat between the
separatist Kosovo Liberation Army rebels and Serb forces is largely
holding. But many expect fighting to resume by spring if a
political settlement is not reached.
	   Frequent shootings have marred the shaky peace _ the latest a
report of attacks by gunmen on two Serb police patrols Wednesday
that injured two policeman.
	   Hill, returning to the region from Washington, met for several
hours Wednesday with ethnic Albanian negotiators in Pristina. He
planned to meet later with a political representative of the KLA.
	   He has talks Thursday in Belgrade with Serb authorities, who
formally rejected the latest U.S. peace plan draft on Wednesday.
	   ``We believe that our negotiations are still on track,'' Hill,
who also is U.S. ambassador to neighboring Macedonia, told
reporters.
	   ``Ultimately the responsibility of reaching a settlement rests
with both sides,'' he said. ``They need to find ways to
compromise.''
	   Both Hill and Wolfgang Petritsch, the European Union envoy for
Kosovo who joined in the talks, cited the urgency of trying to
reach a settlement soon in order to head off new fighting.
Petritsch said ``something should be achieved in the next couple of
weeks.''
	   ``This is a very decisive point in time,'' he said. ``We mustn't
lose the momentum.''
	   But based on their public statements, the gulf between the sides
appears huge. Hill admitted ``it's not an easy process.''
	   Ethnic Albanian officials insist on a solution that would break
Kosovo away from Serbian control, while the KLA has said it won't
accept anything short of outright independence.
	   Senior Serbian officials back a Serb peace plan that keeps the
province firmly within the republic.
	   Serb negotiator Ratko Markovic said the U.S. draft would require
``reconstructing the whole of Yugoslavia'' and lead to independence
for Kosovo.
	   Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians comprise about 90 percent of a
population of 2 million, had autonomy until then-Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic revoked it in 1989.
	   After KLA rebels began attacking the police forces that maintain
a massive presence in the province, Serbian forces launched a
crackdown last February that killed hundreds of people and uprooted
an estimated 300,000 from their homes.
	   Periodic violence has continued. The pro-government Serb Media
Center said Albanian gunmen attacked police patrols Wednesday near
the village of Dolovo in western Kosovo and Opterusa in the
southwest.
	   Two policemen were hospitalized after the Dolovo attack.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Enraged by Israel's refusal to
release security prisoners, Palestinians stoned Israeli troops
Wednesday in the most widespread West Bank clashes in months. A
17-year-old stone mason was killed by Israeli gunfire and scores of
other Palestinians were injured.
	   The violence came despite U.S. appeals for calm and raised new
concerns that U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to the region
next week is triggering unrest, rather than reassuring Israelis and
Palestinians about their troubled peace accord, as intended.
	   On the outskirts of West Bank towns, thousands of Palestinians
hurled stones from slingshots at helmeted Israeli soldiers who
fired tear gas, live rounds and rubber-coated steel pellets.
	   In scenes reminiscent of the 1987-1993 Palestinian uprising
which began exactly 11 years ago Wednesday, streets were littered
with rocks and overturned metal trash containers, and walls of
thick smoke from burning tires rose into the air.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu traded new recriminations Wednesday and said
they would not soften positions despite intensive U.S. efforts to
get the Wye River land-for-security accord back on track.
	   Netanyahu has suspended Israel's troop withdrawal in the West
Bank and said that with the Palestinians violating ``every part of
the agreement,'' he was not likely to change his views.
	   ``If they (the Palestinians) mend their ways, we'll continue
with the agreement,'' Netanyahu said. ``If they don't, we won't.''
	   A defiant Arafat said he would not drop demands that as part of
the Wye agreement, Israel release Palestinians jailed for
anti-Israeli activities and not just common criminals. ``We tell
our heroes in the prisons we will not close our eyes until we see
them in front of our eyes,'' Arafat told cheering supporters.
	   Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin announced he would
refuse food in solidarity with hundreds of prisoners on hunger
strikes.
	   Netanyahu has said he told Arafat from the start that Israel
would not free those involved in attacks on Israelis and accused
the Palestinian Authority of inciting against Israel to achieve
with violence what it cannot get in negotiations.
	   While Wednesday's violent protests outside most West Bank towns
appeared to have been coordinated to some degree by Arafat's Fatah
faction, the issue also touched a raw nerve in Palestinian society
and many Palestinians joined in spontaneously. Nearly every family
has had members jailed by Israel in 30 years of occupation.
	   Asis Barghouti, 21, who was shot in the arm by Israeli troops
during clashes north of the town of Ramallah, said he took to the
streets because his father has been held for three years without
charges and his uncle has already served 21 years of a life term
for an attack in which Israelis were killed.
	   ``If Netanyahu does not release the prisoners, this will be the
situation every day,'' Barghouti said from his hospital bed,
referring to the hours-long Ramallah clashes in which hundreds of
Palestinians burned tires and pelted Israeli troops with rocks.
	   Barghouti's grandfather, Salah, 74, dressed in a long brown
robe, said he backed the rioters. ``I was out there with them,
collecting rocks and giving them to the young men,'' he said.
	   A 17-year-old stone mason, Jihad Iyad, died at Ramallah Hospital
after being shot in the chest by Israeli troops.
	   In Jerusalem, Nasr Erekat, a 21-year-old university student and
cousin of chief Palestinian peace negotiator Saeb Erekat, died of
injuries sustained two days earlier. Over a thousand people
attended his funeral Wednesday night, scores of them leaving the
procession to throw stones at nearby Israeli troops. The soldiers
responded with rubber bullets and tear gas.
	   In all, 87 Palestinians were injured Wednesday by rubber bullets
and three by live rounds. Nine Israelis, including four soldiers
and two riot policemen, were hurt by stones.
	   Hoping to calm the situation before Clinton's arrival Saturday
night, the U.S. Mideast peace coordinator, Dennis Ross, held talks
with Netanyahu and Arafat to try to settle the disputes.
	   On the prisoner issue, Ross appeared to be siding with Israel,
saying that ``the prime minister is doing what he said he would
do.'' Under the Wye accord, Israel is to release 750 prisoners by
the end of January. In a first stage, Netanyahu freed 250, most of
them criminals.
	   Ross also said he was trying to prevent a new argument over the
procedures for revoking provisions in the PLO founding charter
calling for Israel's destruction.
	   On Monday, the Palestine National Council, the Palestinians'
parliament-in-exile, is to reaffirm a decision by lesser bodies to
annul those clauses. Both Arafat and Clinton will speak to the
delegates. Netanyahu insists the PNC take a vote, but the
Palestinians say a vote is not required. Invitations to the PNC
gathering inform delegates the purpose is to hear Clinton speak.
	   ``The PNC doesn't intend to vote on anything,'' Palestinian
legislator Walid el Awadeh told Israel's Channel 2 TV. ``We are
committed only to what was decided in Wye River.''
	   Ross said he was trying to arrange a compromise.
	   ``The procedure that will be worked out will make it very clear
once and for all that the charter is nullified,'' Ross said.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The top U.S. envoy for Kosovo
insisted Wednesday that diplomatic efforts aimed at resolving the
conflict are ``still on track'' despite rejection by all sides of
the latest peace proposals.
	   Christopher Hill spoke after launching a new round of shuttle
talks in the turbulent province, where the ethnic Albanian majority
and Serbian authorities have refused to budge from their main
demands.
	   An October truce that halted months of fighting between
separatist rebels and Serb forces is largely holding. But many
expect fighting to resume by spring if a political settlement is
not reached.
	   Frequent shooting incidents have marred the shaky peace _ the
latest a report of attacks by gunmen on two Serb police patrols
Wednesday that injured two policeman, one seriously in the Kosovo
village of Dolovo.
	   After KLA rebels began attacking the police forces that maintain
a massive presence in the province, Serbian forces launched a
crackdown last February that killed hundreds of people and uprooted
an estimated 300,000 from their homes.
	   Hill, returning to the region from Washington, met for several
hours with ethnic Albanian negotiators in Pristina. He planned to
meet later with a political representative of the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   He has scheduled talks Thursday in Belgrade with the Serbian
side. Senior Serbian officials, including President Milan
Milutinovic, formally rejected the latest Hill plan Wednesday,
reiterating support for a Serb draft which keeps the province
firmly within the republic.
	   Ethnic Albanian negotiators insist on a solution that would
break away Kosovo from Serbia, while the KLA has said it won't
accept anything short of outright independence.
	   ``We believe that our negotiations are still on track,'' Hill,
who also is U.S. ambassador to neighboring Macedonia, said.
	   ``Ultimately the responsibility of reaching a settlement rests
with both sides,'' he said. ``They need to find ways to
compromise.''
	   Both Hill and Wolfgang Petritsch, the European Union envoy for
Kosovo, who also joined in the talks, cited the urgency of trying
to reach a settlement soon in order to head off new fighting.
Petritsch expressed optimism that ``something should be achieved in
the next couple of weeks.''
	   ``This is a very decisive point in time,'' he said. ``We mustn't
lose the momentum.''
	   In Paris, French President Jacques Chirac told Kosovo's leading
ethnic Albanian politician, Ibrahim Rugova, of France's concern
over the ``absence of political will'' on both sides to resolve the
crisis.
	   Chirac said the two sides should begin talks without delay on
the future of the province, according to a French official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   ``I hope that with the efforts of the United States, the
European Union and also France ... that we will arrive at
something,'' Rugova told reporters after the 45-minute meeting.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The top U.S. envoy for Kosovo

conflict are ``still on track'' despite rejection by all sides of

Janzen's premonition comes true
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ American golfer Lee Janzen left the
Tour Championship in Atlanta with two strong hunches that turned
out to be correct.
	   He was 13th in the Presidents Cup standings for the second
straight time,
	   and figured that wouldn't be enough to earn him a spot on the
team. He was right _ captain Jack Nicklaus took Fred Couples and
John Huston.
	   ``My wife and I had some strange feeling, even after the Tour
Championship, that the team wasn't finally set,'' Janzen said.
``Every other time I missed the team, I knew that was it. But I
thought for some reason there might be something.''
	   Janzen was selected as an alternate when Hal Sutton withdrew
after his father-in-law died of a heart attack.
	   ``The way I got in wasn't great,'' Janzen said.
	   Still, the timing could not have been better. Janzen had just
putted out on the 18th green in Taiwan when a tournament official
handed him a note to call PGA Tour officials. His flight home to
Florida was due to depart in less than two hours.
	   ``If they hadn't got ahold of me then, I probably would have
been in San Francisco before I found out,'' he said.
	   Instead, he made the nine-hour flight to Australia.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; CLOTHES SWAPPING: &LR;  When Janzen arrived at his hotel room in
Melbourne, Sutton's uniforms for the week were waiting on the bed.
	   The shirts were about the same size, but the pants didn't fit _
Sutton weighs about 12 kilograms (25 pounds) more than Janzen. He
soon learned that David Duval was having problems with his
tight-fitting pants, and ...
	   ``David's pants fit me better than they fit him, and Hal's pants
fit him better than they fit me,'' Janzen said. ``So we just
swapped. For the last year and a half, I would like to have been in
David's shoes.''
	   Duval has won seven times and more money than anyone in that
stretch.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; CUP BASHING: &LR;  Don't count former British Open champion Bob
Charles among
	   the fans of the Presidents Cup.
	   Charles returned home Wednesday to play the New Zealand Open and
promptly
	   criticized the amount of attention the Presidents Cup was
getting. The two captain's choices for the International team,
Frank Nobilo and Greg Turner, are from New Zealand.
	   Charles predicted the three-year-old event would eventually fade
away.
	   ``The Presidents Cup is a non-event as far as I'm concerned,''
Charles said. He compared it to the Davis Cup in tennis, which used
to get the top players around the world but now struggles to get
any of the top 30.
	   ``It will be the Americans who start losing interest in it
first,'' Charles predicted, adding that he still enjoys watching
the Ryder Cup.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; SOUTH AFRICA NEXT?: &LR;  Once it was decided that the Presidents
Cup had to leave the United States, most International team players
and captain Peter Thomson agreed that the only logical choice was
Australia.
	   The Presidents Cup will return to the Robert Trent Jones Golf
Club in Virginia in 2000 before going overseas again. Next time,
Nick Price would like to see it go to South Africa.
	   ``I don't think we could put the pressure on (PGA Tour
commissioner Tim) Finchem,'' Price said, ``but I think he
understands our feeling on it, and that we sort of believe in the
back of our minds than in the year 2002, it will go'' to South
Africa.
	   Price said he's been amazed at the reception the Presidents Cup
has received in Australia, and said the event can only be a huge
boost to the Australasian tour.
	   ``Those of us from southern Africa want it to do the same for
us,'' he said. ``I don't think Australia or South Africa has seen a
field of this quality gathered at one time. It would be a huge
thing for South African golf.'' (djp/df)

	   CALAIS, France (AP) _ People have swum the English Channel
before. Now someone has walked from England to France.
	   A 36-year-old Russian sailor was detained Wednesday in the
Channel Tunnel where trains emerge on the French side, near Calais.
He entered the 30-mile undersea tunnel over the weekend on the
English side, police said.
	   Police were still trying to figure out how he was able to avoid
detection by surveillance cameras and get past high fences and
barbed wire. But the real miracle, they said, was that he was still
alive.
	   The tunnel is supposed to be only for high-speed trains that
whiz up to 92 mph through the tunnel dozens of times a day,
whipping up winds that can suck up objects, even a human being.
	   The company that runs the tunnel believes the intruder survived
by taking refuge in small openings in the wall every 410 yards.
	   ``We are still asking ourselves how this man could have gotten
into the tunnel,'' said Dominique Maire, spokeswoman for Eurotunnel
in Paris.
	   The company is ``very worried'' by the incident, the first time
a pedestrian has used the channel, she said, adding ``we will be
very interested in knowing why.''
	   The man, who was not identified by name, wanted to join the
French Foreign Legion, the ITAR-Tass news agency in Moscow said.
	   ITAR-Tass said the man arrived in Scotland in November on the
Russian trading ship Polar Star, then hitchhiked across England to
make his way to France and the famed fighting force.
	   French police returned the man to England, where he was being
questioned by immigration officers, the British Home Office said.
	   Millions of people take the train each year through the Channel
Tunnel, which opened in 1994.

Contemporary painting sets record at auction
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A portrait by British artist Lucien Freud on
Wednesday became the most expensive contemporary work to be sold in
Europe, fetching 2.8 million pounds (4.62 million) at auction.
	   The ``Naked Portrait with Reflection'' was sold at Sotheby's for
more than double the expected sale price, the auction house said.
It was sold to an anonymous bidder.
	   The previous European record for a contemporary work was 2.5
million pounds (dlrs 4.12 million) in April 1990 for La Calipette,
a painting by French artist Jean Dubuffet.
	   The Freud portrait, from 1980, depicts a voluptuous women
reclining on a sofa in the nude.

Tibet facing new cultural revolution, spiritual leader says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with news conference &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Dalai Lama said Wednesday that conditions for
his fellow Tibetans are worsening under Chinese rule, and that
indirect communication with Beijing has failed to produce results.
	   ``The situation is very difficult, very grave, and it seems to
be like a new cultural revolution is taking place in Tibet at the
moment,'' the Tibetan spiritual leader said, referring to Chinese
political oppression from 1966-76.
	   ``We have to hope to improve our situation,'' he told a hall
filled with 2,000 supporters, answering a written question from the
audience. ``But things have become very difficult.''
	   The Dalai Lama, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, said he had
adopted a moderate position ``by adopting non-official canons of
communication. These canons don't work anymore.''
	   The Buddhist leader asked for continued support but also said
his movement ``does not want to be victorious, that there are
victors and vanquished. What we want is victory for both,'' he said
to applause.
	   In Paris for a 50th anniversary celebration of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, the Dalai Lama earlier Wednesday
renewed his call for a dialogue with Chinese leaders.
	   ``For the past 20 years, I have always said I was ready to start
a dialogue,'' he told Europe 1 radio.
	   The Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising
against Chinese rule, has been campaigning for greater autonomy for
the Himalayan region.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Enraged by Israel's refusal to
release security prisoners, Palestinians stoned Israeli troops
Wednesday in the most widespread West Bank clashes in months. A
17-year-old Palestinian was killed by Israeli gunfire, and at least
96 people were injured.
	   The violence came despite U.S. appeals for calm and raised new
concerns that U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to the region
next week is triggering unrest, rather than reassuring Israelis and
Palestinians about their troubled peace accord, as intended.
	   On the outskirts of West Bank towns, thousands of Palestinians
hurled stones from slingshots at helmeted Israeli soldiers who
fired tear gas, live rounds and rubber-coated steel pellets.
	   In scenes reminiscent of the 1987-1993 Palestinian uprising,
which began exactly 11 years ago Wednesday, streets were littered
with rocks and overturned metal trash containers, and walls of
thick smoke from burning tires rose into the air.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu traded new recriminations and said they would
not soften positions despite intensive U.S. efforts to get the Wye
River land-for-security accord back on track.
	   Netanyahu has suspended Israel's troop withdrawal in the West
Bank and said that with the Palestinians violating ``every part of
the agreement,'' he was not likely to change his views.
	   ``If they (the Palestinians) mend their ways, we'll continue
with the agreement,'' Netanyahu said. ``If they don't, we won't.''
	   A defiant Arafat said he would not drop demands that as part of
the Wye agreement, Israel release Palestinians jailed for
anti-Israeli activities and not just common criminals.
	   ``We tell our heroes in the prisons we will not close our eyes
until we see them in front of our eyes,'' Arafat told cheering
supporters.
	   Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin announced he would
refuse food in solidarity with hundreds of prisoners on hunger
strikes.
	   Netanyahu has said he told Arafat from the start that Israel
would not free those involved in attacks on Israelis and accused
the Palestinian Authority of inciting people against Israel to
achieve with violence what it cannot get in negotiations.
	   While the violent protests outside most West Bank towns appeared
to have been coordinated to some degree by Arafat's Fatah faction,
the issue also touched a raw nerve in Palestinian society and many
Palestinians joined in spontaneously. Nearly every family has had
members jailed by Israel in 30 years of occupation.
	   Asis Barghouti, 21, who was shot in the arm by Israeli troops
during clashes north of the town of Ramallah, said he took to the
streets because his father has been held for three years without
charges and his uncle has already served 21 years of a life term
for an attack in which Israelis were killed.
	   ``If Netanyahu does not release the prisoners, this will be the
situation every day,'' Barghouti said from his hospital bed.
	   A 17-year-old stone mason, Jihad Iyad, died at Ramallah Hospital
after being shot in the chest by Israeli troops.
	   In Jerusalem, Nasr Erekat, a 21-year-old university student and
cousin of chief Palestinian peace negotiator Saeb Erekat, died of
injuries sustained two days earlier. More than a thousand people
attended his funeral Wednesday night, scores of them leaving the
procession to throw stones at nearby Israeli troops. The soldiers
responded with rubber bullets and tear gas.
	   In all, 87 Palestinians were injured Wednesday. Nine Israelis,
including four soldiers and two riot policemen, were hurt by
stones.
	   Hoping to calm the situation before Clinton's arrival Saturday
night, the U.S. Mideast peace coordinator, Dennis Ross, held talks
with Netanyahu and Arafat.
	   On the prisoner issue, Ross appeared to be siding with Israel,
saying that ``the prime minister is doing what he said he would
do.'' Under the Wye accord, Israel is to release 750 prisoners by
the end of January. In a first stage, Netanyahu freed 250, most of
them criminals.
	   Ross also said he was trying to prevent a new argument over the
procedures for revoking provisions in the PLO founding charter
calling for Israel's destruction.
	   On Monday, the Palestine National Council, the Palestinians'
parliament-in-exile, is to reaffirm a decision by lesser bodies to
annul those clauses. Both Arafat and Clinton will speak to the
delegates. Netanyahu insists the PNC take a vote, but the
Palestinians say a vote is not required. Invitations to the PNC
gathering inform delegates the purpose is to hear Clinton speak.
	   ``The PNC doesn't intend to vote on anything,'' Palestinian
legislator Walid el Awadeh told Israel's Channel 2 TV. ``We are
committed only to what was decided in Wye River.''
	   Ross said he was trying to arrange a compromise.
	   ``The procedure that will be worked out will make it very clear
once and for all that the charter is nullified,'' Ross said.

	   KAISERSLAUTERN, Germany (AP) _ Kaiserslautern, already sure of a
place in the Champions League quarterfinals, cruised 5-2 past HJK
Helsinki on Wednesday, paced by three goals from Uwe Roesler.
	   The victory before 25,000 fans who braved a heavy snowfall
clinched first place for Kaiserslautern in Group F.
	   Helsinki massed its defense and relied on counterattacks to
threaten the German goal. The game plan paid off in the 31st minute
when Jari Ilola used a good pass from Aarno Turpeinen to shoot the
Finns ahead in the 29th minute.
	   Kaiserslautern tied the score two minutes before half-time on a
header by Roesler, a substitute who came on in the 38th minute.
	   Just four minutes into the second half, Olaf Marschall headed in
Kaiserslautern's second goal.
	   Roesler got his second in the 61st as Helsinki appeared to tire.
	   But the Finns managed to pull one back in the 68th through their
Brazilian, Luiz Antonio Moraes.
	   Roesler capped his great night by sealing the victory in the
80th. Juergen Rische added the fifth for the Germans in the 85th.

Champions Cup: Manchester United and Bayern qualify for last eight
</HEADLINE>
after 1-1 tie &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Manchester United and Bayern Munich
cruised into the quarterfinal of the European Champions Cup on
Wednesday after a 1-1 tie at OId Trafford.
	   Irish midfielder Roy Keane fired United into the lead two
minutes before half time and Bosnian forward Hasan Salihamidzic
leveled for Bayern in the 55th minute.
	   The result means that Bayern qualifies for the last eight by
finishing top of Group D and United gained its place by being one
of the best two runners up.
	   Playing at Old Trafford for the first time in its history,
Bayern almost fell behind in the sixth minute when David Beckham
set up a chance with a superb long pass to Ryan Giggs. Andy Cole
took possession and his shot was blocked by a defender's leg and
Dwight Yorke's follow-up drive shaved the crossbar.
	   But Giovane Elber almost gave the German team the lead in the
16th minute, his diving header from Bixente Lizarazu's leftwing
cross flashing wide of the post.
	   Cole fired inches wide in the 25th minute after a good touch on
by Giggs and then Bayern goalkeeper Oliver Kahn did well to save a
20-meter shot from the Reds' striker.
	   But United went ahead in the 43rd minute.
	   Giggs pulled a pass from almost by the left corner flag into a
big space on the edge of the Bayern area and Keane drove a low,
hard shot between Kahn and his right hand post.
	   Norwegian defender Ronny Johnsen should have made it 2-0 in the
opening minute of the second half when he completely missed the
ball in front of goal when Keane played Beckham's corner into his
path.
	   United's Danish goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel produced a brilliant
acrobatic save to keep out a well-struck drive by Sammy Kuffour in
the 54th minute and preserve his team's lead.
	   But Bayern leveled a minute later when Thomas Strunz headed on a
rightwing corner and Bosnian forward Hasan Salihamidzic forced the
ball over the line from barely two meters out.
	   Bayern almost went ahead in the 58th minute when Elber stuck out
a foot and prodded the ball over the top with only Schmeichel to
beat. At the other end Paul Scholes had a shot deflected wide and
Kahn made a good save from Dwight Yorke's overhead shot.
	   A glancing header from Cole went wide and Scholes fired too high
as United threatened again as both teams created chances even
though, with the score at 1-1, they were both headed for the
quarterfinal.

	   PORTO, Portugal (AP) _ Portugal's FC Porto beat visitor Ajax 3-0
Wednesday in the European Champions Cup, ending the Dutch club's
faint hopes of reaching the quarter-finals of the competition it
won four seasons ago.
	   The result left both clubs on seven points after six games in
Group A and out of contention for a quarter-final berth.
	   After a mostly slow-paced and uneventful first half, Zlatko
Zahovic opened the scoring after 55 minutes with a diving header
from short range after Brazilian Mario Jardel broke down the left
flank.
	   The Slovenian notched his second of the game, and his seventh in
the competition, 20 minutes later, once again linking up with
Jardel to beat goalie Edwin van der Sar.
	   Ljubimko Drulovic sealed it in the 80th minute after a solo run.

Champions Cup: Juventus 2, Rosenborg 0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Filippo Inzaghi and Nicola Amoruso fired in
first-half goals as Juventus of Turin beat Norway's Rosenborg 2-0
Wednesday and got help elsewhere to scrape into the Champions Cup
quarterfinals as Group B winner.
	   Inzaghi turned an errant Amoruso shot into a pass in the 16th
minute, latching onto the ball, splitting two defenders and sending
a low, left-footed shot inside the right post.
	   Amoruso, starting in place of injured star striker Alessandro
Del Piero, doubled the lead in the 35th. He chested down French
World Cup hero Zinedine Zidane's long cross and slotted home from 5
meters (yards), before about 10,000 spectators at cavernous Delle
Alpi Stadium.
	   But Juventus, a cup finalist the past three seasons and titlist
in 1996, got through thanks only to last-place Athletic Bilbao's
1-0 victory Wednesday over Galatasaray _ and a complicated
tiebreaking formula.
	   Juve, which had tied its first five outings, Rosenborg and
Galatasaray all finished group play with 8 points, but the Italians
advance because they had the best record in games involving the
three clubs.
	   Players on the Juventus bench jumped up and down and hugged each
other when news arrived from Spain that Athletic Bilbao had scored
against Turkey's Galatasaray.
	   It was strikingly similar to last year, when Juventus had to
beat England's Manchester United in the last group game and hope
Rosenborg would do no better than a draw against Greek club
Olympiakos.
	   It all worked out, with late goals in both games deciding the
outcomes, and Juventus went on to lose to Real Madrid in the cup
final.

	   LENS, France (AP) _ Profiting from a debatable sixth minute red
card to Lens captain Frederic Dehu, Dynamo Kiev beat the French
champion 1-0 on Wednesday to advance to the quarterfinals of the
Champions League for the second successive season.
	   After persistent Kiev pressure, midfield player Kakha Kaladze
scored the breakthrough goal in the 60th minute, heading in at the
far post after Serhiy Rebrov had flicked on a right wing corner.
	   Vladyslav Vashchuk made it 2-0 in the 75th minute, sliding to
tap in a Valentyn Belkevich cross.
	   Vladimir Smicer pulled one back in the 78th minute, with a fine
goal direct from a free kick, but Lens cause was lost.
	   As it pressed forward desperately in the final minutes Andriy
Shevchenko raced through to score a third and seal the win for
Kiev.
	   Lens, which has never reached the quarterfinals of European
competition, began like a team playing the most important match in
its 92-year history.
	   But its early enthusiasm was dashed when Slovakian referee Lubos
Michel sent off captain and key defender Dehu.
	   Andriy Husin played an outstanding defense-splitting pass to
dangerman Shevchenko behind the Lens back four.
	   As the striker raced toward goal, he was challenged late by
Dehu, before keeping his feet for two paces and diving theatrically
to the ground.
	   Kiev, which needed at least a 1-1 draw to have a chance of
advancing, pressed forward in numbers and dominated play.
	   Shevchenko was the main threat.
	   Midway through the first half, he was unlucky not to score, when
he chipped goalkeeper Guillaume Warmuz brilliantly with the outside
or his right boot from the edge of the penalty box, only to see the
ball strike the inside of the post.
	   Lens battled bravely, but looked second best against the gifted
Ukrainians as its ten men began to tire.
	   Warmuz made good saves from Shevchenko and Rebrov, but in attack
the French team badly missed the suspended Tony Vairelles, the
source of most of its best attacking ideas in this season's
Champions League.

	   GRAZ, Austria (AP) _ Cristiano Zanetti and Roberto Baggio scored
in the second half-time to give Inter Milan a 2-0 victory over
Sturm Graz on Wednesday and a place in the quarterfinals of the
Champions League.
	   The victory over the winless Austrians assured Inter of winning
Group C ahead of Real Madrid, which also advanced.
	   Ronaldo, Inter's Brazilian superstar who was making a comeback
after an injury, missed a great chance in the 3rd minute after
faking Austrian defenders. With an open goal before him, Ronaldo's
shot sailed over the net.
	   Ronaldo was taken out on the hour, apparently still not fully
fit for 90 minutes after his injury.
	   Only four minutes later, Zanetti scored Inter's goal, burying a
clear shot from the right side.
	   Baggio, a substitute, sealed the victory in the 80th minute.
	   A crowd of 14,000 at the Arnold Schwarzenegger stadium saw Graz
lose its fifth of six games in the group.
	   Sturm, with only one point from the previous five games, missed
several starters, including Austria's Player of the Year, Ivica
Vastic, who fell ill before the match.

Clash over surprise arms inspections erupts in Baghdad
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with Iraqi comment. &QL; 
 &UR; With UN-Iraq &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos BAG106-107 &QL; 
 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi officials blocked U.N. arms monitors
from holding a surprise inspection Wednesday at the Baghdad
headquarters of the ruling Baath Party, a key site in Saddam
Hussein's government. U.N. officials immediately denounced the
move.
	   The inspectors withdrew after an Iraqi official demanded that
they first provide a written declaration of what they were looking
for, the official Iraqi News Agency said.
	   ``This was an absolutely legal, no-notice inspection and they
blocked us,'' Richard Butler, head of the U.N. Special Commission
that oversees inspections, told The Associated Press in New York.
	   Later Wednesday, however, an Iraqi official suggested the
standoff occurred because of a mistake by an Iraqi escort in
declaring the site sensitive.
	   The incident _ which has the potential to blow up into another
U.N.-Iraq crisis _ came two days after Butler announced that he was
ordering the resumption of surprise inspections. On Tuesday, the
inspectors visited 32 sites and on Wednesday, 10 more.
	   Butler said the Iraqi demand for a written notice was ``simply
wrong'' and ``nonsense.''
	   Despite the Iraqi interference, Butler plans to continue the
searches, which are expected to conclude by early next week, said
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, speaking at a NATO
meeting in Brussels, Belgium, said Iraq had no choice but to work
with the inspectors as it has pledged to do.
	   ``There will be no comprehensive review (of sanctions against
Iraq) until it is evident that Iraq is cooperating with UNSCOM,''
she said, using the acronym for the weapons team.
	   Unannounced visits in the past have been a major source of
friction with Iraq, leading to three crises in the past year.
	   Iraq had suspended the inspections in August. It allowed them to
resume only last month, averting a military strike by the United
States and Britain. The two countries have left an armada in the
Gulf to ensure that Iraq abides by its promise to cooperate.
	   Still, Wednesday's dispute elicited a cautious reaction from the
United States.
	   David Leavy, spokesman for the National Security Council, said
Iraq's rebuff to inspectors did not bring the United States closer
to armed conflict with Iraq. He stressed that U.S. President Bill
Clinton's administration wants to hear Butler's report to the
Security Council on an overall assessment of Iraq's compliance _
not just on inspections but also in turning over documents.
	   UNSCOM must certify that Iraq has eliminated its chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons as well as long-range missiles
before U.N. economic sanctions can be lifted. The sanctions were
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which sparked the
Gulf War. Iraqi officials have long insisted they have eliminated
all illegal weapons.
	   In New York, Iraq's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Saeed Hasan said the
building in dispute was the headquarters of the Baghdad branch of
the Baath Party.
	   Oil Minister Amer Mohammed Rashid said the U.N. team arrived
Wednesday morning at the site, which their Iraqi escort declared as
``sensitive.''
	   The escort allowed four inspectors to enter briefly, Rashid
said. They came out and requested 12 inspectors be allowed to
enter. ``This was refused by the Iraqi (escort),'' he said.
	   Rashid added that the escort was wrong in declaring the site
sensitive, which he said would include installations of the elite
Republican Guard and security services.
	   The minister told a news conference, however, that the
inspectors are deliberately seeking a confrontation.
	   He said Iraq did agree in a Feb. 23 accord with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to allow surprise inspections. But, he
said, the United Nations also agreed ``to respect the security,
integrity and legitimate concerns of the Iraqi government,'' which
Rashid said included prior notice in visiting sites the government
considered sensitive.
	   U.N. inspectors have insisted that their searches should not be
restricted by Iraq in any way.
	   ``The practices of the inspectors ... have the clear goal of
creating crises and problems,'' the Iraqi News Agency quoted Gen.
Hossam Mohammed Amin as saying.
	   As many as 140 inspectors were working in Iraq on Wednesday, as
well as some visiting experts, said Caroline Cross, a U.N.
spokeswoman in Baghdad. She would not give the exact number
involved but said it was ``a little less than 200.''
	   Inspectors used helicopters in one of the searches Wednesday
outside Baghdad, Amin said.
	   A team from the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is
responsible for inspecting Iraq's nuclear programs, also arrived in
Baghdad on Wednesday and met with Iraqi officials, said Gen. Hossam
Mohammed Amin, who heads an office that works with UNSCOM.
	   Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf appealed
Wednesday for support from Arab countries.
	   In November, several key Arab countries declared that Iraq would
be held responsible for any conflict over arms inspections.

Real Madrid defeats Spartak 2-1 in Champions League

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Defending champions Real Madrid moved into
the quarter finals of the Champions League Wednesday with a 2-1 win
over Spartak Moscow.
	   Star striker Raul Gonzalez scored for the Spaniards in the 34th
minute, heading in a corner from Roberto Carlos.
	   Another header, this time by Savio Bartolini in the 65th minute
after a pass from Pedrag Mijatovic, gave Madrid its second goal.
	   The Russians scored in the 89th minute on a header by Dmitry
Khlestov.
	   Real Madrid had pressed hard in the opening stages, getting off
half a dozen shots on goal in the first ten minutes. Its best
chance was a shot by Mijatovic from five meters out that was
stopped by diving goalkeeper Andrei Tikhonov.
	   The Russian also stopped a blazing kick from Clarence Seedorf
from 20 yards out.
	   The Russians picked up the pace and counterattacked, keeping
Madrid pinned down in its zone as the half wore on.
	   Real Madrid dominated again in the second period, and with five
minutes to go had a chance to make it 3-0 as Mijatovic made a nifty
looping pass to Seedorf in the area but the Dutchman shot high.
	   The Russians scored virtually as time ran out to make it 2-1.

Court awards fan damages for stadium injury
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ A court ordered Italian League club AC Milan
on Wednesday to pay 115 million lire (dlrs 70,000) in damages to a
fan hurt at a match, a groundbreaking ruling.
	   The fan suffered an eye injury in the stands at Milan's home
game against Sampdoria of Genoa in October 1990.
	   The court ruled that soccer games ``have become dangerous
activities'' because of brawling by fans and said home teams must
compensate injured spectators if the clubs cannot prove they took
all possible security measures.
	   Wednesday's ruling ``contains contradictions,'' Milan club
lawyer Leandro Cantamessa told the ANSA news agency. ``It goes
against the jurisprudence of recent years, which has always held
that a soccer game is not a dangerous activity.''
	   The court made reference to ``the series of incidents, some even
fatal, that ruin each sports season.''
	   Italian major and minor league soccer is often marred by clashes
involving ``ultras,'' the equivalent of English hooligans.
	   The most recent example came Nov. 3, when an explosive device
was tossed onto the field during a UEFA Cup match between Italy's
Fiorentina and Switzerland's Grasshoppers. An official was injured,
and Fiorentina was kicked out of the competition.
	   In 1995, a 25-year-old Genoa supporter was stabbed to death in a
fight between rival fans outside the stadium before a Genoa-AC
Milan Serie A match. In response, Italian authorities canceled the
following Sunday's league schedule and other professional sports
events _ the nation's first game day without soccer in a
half-century.
	   ``It is a very dangerous precedent,'' Juventus club president
Vittorio Chiusano, a lawyer, said of Wednesday's court decision.
``Anything suffered by a fan at the stadium, regardless of the
circumstances, could lead to asking for damages.''

<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Profiting from a debatable sixth minute red
card to Lens captain Frederic Dehu, Dynamo Kiev beat the French
champion 3-1 on Wednesday to advance to the quarterfinals of the
Champions League for the second successive season.
	   After persistent Kiev pressure, midfield player Kakha Kaladze
scored the breakthrough goal in the 60th minute, heading in at the
far post after Serhiy Rebrov had flicked on a right wing corner.
	   Vladyslav Vashchuk made it 2-0 in the 75th minute, sliding to
tap in a Valentyn Belkevich cross.
	   Vladimir Smicer pulled one back in the 78th minute, with a fine
goal direct from a free kick, but Lens cause was lost.
	   As it pressed forward desperately in the final minutes Andriy
Shevchenko raced through to score a third and seal the win for
Kiev.
	   Lens, which has never reached the quarterfinals of European
competition, began like a team playing the most important match in
its 92-year history.
	   But its early enthusiasm was dashed when Slovakian referee Lubos
Michel sent off captain and key defender Dehu.
	   Andriy Husin played an outstanding defense-splitting pass to
dangerman Shevchenko behind the Lens back four.
	   As the striker raced toward goal, he was challenged late by
Dehu, before keeping his feet for two paces and diving theatrically
to the ground.
	   Kiev, which needed at least a 1-1 draw to have a chance of
advancing, pressed forward in numbers and dominated play.
	   Shevchenko was the main threat.
	   Midway through the first half, he was unlucky not to the outside
or his right boot from the edge of the penalty box, only to see the
ball strike the inside of the post.
	   Lens battled bravely, but looked second best against the gifted
Ukrainians as its ten men began to tire.
	   Warmuz made good saves from Shevchenko and Rebrov, but in attack
the French team badly missed the suspended Tony Vairelles, the
source of most of its best attacking ideas in this season's
Champions League.

	   EINDHOVEN, Netherlands (AP) _ Two goals from Benfica striker
Nuno Gomez helped the Portuguese side to a 2-2 draw at PSV
Eindhoven Wednesday in the final round of the Champions League.
	   PSV dominated the first 20 minutes but Benfica gradually came
back into the game and it was against the run of play when Russian
defender Dmitri Khokhlov headed PSV ahead on 41 minutes.
	   But Gomez was pulled down in the penalty area just two minutes
after the break and got up to convert the penalty himself and tie
the game up at 1-1.
	   Belgian Luc Nilis twice went close with free kicks for PSV but
Gomez popped up again to score on 65 minutes.
	   It took a goal two minutes from time by in-form forward Ruud van
Nistelrooy to save a deserved point for Bobby Robson's hard-working
PSV.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Juventus gained its first win in six attempts and
squeezed into the last eight of the European Champions Cup on
Wednesday.
	   Finalist for the last three seasons, La Juve downed Norway's
Rosenborg 2-0 and gained some help from already-eliminated Athletic
Bilbao, which downed Galatasaray 1-0 in another Group B game to
knock the Turks out.
	   Juventus had tied all its previous five matches but wound up
tying both Galatasaray and Rosenborg on points and advances on the
basis of head-to-head results against the other two.
	   Juventus joins Bayern Munich, Kaiserslautern, Dynamo Kiev, Inter
Milan and Olympiakos of Greece as group winners while defending
titlist and seven-time winner Real Madrid and Manchester United got
through as the best two runners up.
	   Ajax Amsterdam, winner four seasons ago and runner up a year
later, went out after losing 3-0 at FC Porto.

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Stelios Giannacopoulos shot Olympiakos
into the quarterfinals of the Champions League on Wednesday,
scoring in the 64th minute to give his team a vital 1-1 draw at
Croatia Zagreb.
	   It was the first serious chance for the visiting Olympiakos in
the match largely played before the its goal, with Croatia pressing
to achieve a 3-0 victory needed for it to advance.
	   Giannacopoulos managed to surprise Croatia's goalkeeper Drazen
Ladic. The Greek met a neatly lofted ball from the right and guided
it into the net past Ladic's arms.
	   In the end, Porto's 3-0 victory over Ajax Amsterdam dashed any
hopes Croatia could have had of advancing from Group A.
	   Josko Jelicic's goal for Croatia in the 35th minute had the
25,000-strong crowd jumping on their feet and screaming with joy.
	   The home team had numerous chances before that, keeping
Olympiakos goalkeeper Dimitris Eleftheropoulos very busy, but
failing to score.
	   Croatia kept on trying in the second half, and its coach Velimir
Zajec made several substitutions, but to no avail. Bosnian
international Edin Mujcin had the last chance for Croatia in 89th
minute, but the ball sailed wide of the goal.
	   The match was played on an icy pitch in subfreezing weather.

	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Filippo Inzaghi and Nicola Amoruso fired in
first-half goals as Juventus of Turin beat Norway's Rosenborg 2-0
Wednesday and got help elsewhere to scrape into the Champions Cup
quarterfinals as Group B winner.
	   Inzaghi turned an errant Amoruso shot into a pass in the 16th
minute, latching onto the ball, splitting two defenders and sending
a low, left-footed shot inside the right post.
	   Amoruso, starting in place of injured star striker Alessandro
Del Piero, doubled the lead in the 35th. He chested down French
World Cup hero Zinedine Zidane's long cross and slotted home from 5
meters (yards), before about 10,000 spectators at cavernous Delle
Alpi Stadium.
	   But Juventus, a cup finalist the past three seasons and titlist
in 1996, got through thanks only to last-place Athletic Bilbao's
1-0 victory Wednesday over Galatasaray _ and a complicated
tiebreaking formula.
	   Juve, which had tied its first five outings, Rosenborg and
Galatasaray all finished group play with 8 points, and the Italians
advance because they had the best record in games involving the
three clubs.
	   ``We hope this is a positive sign,'' said Juventus coach
Marcello Lippi, whose club has lost three of four games in Italian
League play. ``These have been very, very difficult months, but
this might turn the tables.''
	   Rosenborg came close to taking the lead Wednesday, though, when
captain Mini Jakobsen lobbed a shot from 15 meters (yards) over
charging 'keeper Angelo Peruzzi in the 11th minute. Uruguayan
defender Paolo Montero saved the hosts, arriving just in time to
head the ball over the crossbar on the run with his back to the
field.
	   Once Juve had built a two-goal lead, Juventus retreated into a
defensive stance, with coach Marcello Lippi pulling Amoruso in
favor of defender Mark Iuliano.
	   Peruzzi was called on once to make a tough save, jumping to his
left to block Roar Strand's drive from 15 meters (yards) with 30
minutes remaining.
	   Players on the Juventus bench jumped up and down and hugged each
other when news arrived from Spain that Athletic Bilbao had scored
against Turkey's Galatasaray.
	   ``There was hope, even if we were nervous,'' Lippi said. ``It
was not inconceivable that Bilbao could win. And, of course, we
knew that we could win.''
	   It was strikingly similar to last year, when Juventus had to
beat England's Manchester United in the last group game and hope
Rosenborg would do no better than a draw against Greek club
Olympiakos.
	   It all worked out then, too, with late goals in both games
deciding the outcomes, and Juventus went on to lose to Real Madrid
in the cup final.

meters (yards), before about 10,000 spectators at cavernous Delle
Alpi Stadium.
	   But Juventus, a cup finalist the past three seasons and titlist
in 1996, got through thanks only to last-place Athletic Bilbao's
1-0 victory Wednesday over Galatasaray _ and a complicated
tiebreaking formula.
	   Juve, which had tied its first five outings, Rosenborg and
Galatasaray all finished group play with 8 points, and the Italians
advance because they had the best record in head-to-head games
between the three clubs.

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ The father of American gymnast Dominique Moceanu
was ordered on Wednesday to stay away from her for a full year.
	   The gymnast wept and her father appeared dumbstruck as state
District Judge John Montgomery ruled that Dumitru Moceanu's recent
action constituted family violence under Texas law.
	   Montgomery, who declared the 16-year-old Olympic star a legal
adult on Oct. 28, ruled that Moceanu cannot get within 500 feet
(150 meters) of his daughter, cannot threaten or have her followed
in any way and may only contact her in writing through her lawyer.
	   ``This job comes with a robe and gavel, not a magic wand to make
the pain go away,'' Montgomery said.
	   The decision followed more than four hours of testimony in a
hearing called by the gymnast and her attorney.
	   Dumitru Moceanu told the court that he met with a private
investigator to learn where his estranged daughter was living.
	   Moceanu sometimes rolled her eyes during her father's testimony
under questioning by her court-appointed attorney, Ellen Yarrell.
She also ignored attempts by her mother, Camelia, to make eye
contact in the courtroom.
	   Dumitru Moceanu said he never paid a private investigator even
though he met with one three times. The gymnast had not told her
parents of her new address since Montgomery granted her adult
status.
	   ``I talk with investigator just to find the address,'' said
Dumitru Moceanu, a Romanian immigrant. ``I don't pay him.''
	   Her father also denied following his daughter, but conceded that
he asked her to pull over at a stoplight after school recently.
	   Since she attained legal adulthood, Moceanu says she's endured
verbal threats and stalking by her father. Police are also
investigating a private investigator's claim that Dumitru Moceanu
offered to pay dlrs 10,000 to have a friend and her coach killed.
	   Tape recordings thought to include threats were submitted by the
Houston Police Department this morning for the judge's review in
chambers. They were not entered formally into evidence.
	   ``The threat of danger from my father hangs over me every day,''
the gymnast said in court papers filed a week ago for the
restraining order.
	   The gymnast was supported in court by several friends and her
publicist, Janey Miller. The conflict began when she decided to
fight for control over her millions in earnings and has escalated
ever since.
	   ``It's just awful,'' Miller said. ``It is literally tearing them
apart.''
	   The stormy relationship between father and daughter caught
public notice in late October, when she fled from her home with the
help of friends Marcy and Brian Huggins and her coach, Luminita
Miscenco. Huggins had befriended the Olympian while performing some
work at the dlrs 4 million Moceanu Gymnastics Inc. facility north
of Houston.
	   ``Things have been getting rough for a while, a lot of people
don't know,'' Moceanu said in her original lawsuit. ``We've been
trying to keep things hidden.''
	   The Huggins have also obtained a restraining order against
Dumitru Moceanu.
	   Encouraged by fellow athletes, including gymnast Kurt Thomas, to
take more control of her finances, Moceanu dogged her father and
mother for answers about how her earnings, secured in a trust fund
that they alone have access to, were being spent.
	   ``I kill myself training and going to school, and what is he
doing with my money?'' Moceanu told the Houston Chronicle at the
time. ``They haven't been working since 1996. Where does their
income come from? Me.''
	   After months of stonewalling, the young athlete decided her only
alternative was the courtroom. With her coach by her side, the
gymnast phoned an attorney from a shopping mall pay phone. Within
days, she filed suit against her parents, asking a judge for adult
status so she could legally begin asking for an accounting of how
her trust fund was spent.
	   She also revealed how her every move was monitored by her
father, that she had yet to go unchaperoned on a date. She also
revealed that her father has hit her ``a couple of times'' and that
she ``never had a childhood.''
	   Dumitru and Camelia Moceanu fueled her Olympic dream starting at
age 3. They brought her to Houston so she could be coached by Bela
Karolyi. At 14, Miss Moceanu was the youngest American ever to win
an Olympic gold medal in gymnastics during the 1996 Summer Games in
Atlanta.

Chelsea edges Villa 2-1 to move up to third
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A last minute goal by substitute Tore Andre Flo
gave Chelsea a 2-1 win over Premier League leader Aston Villa on
Wednesday as the west London team moved up from sixth to third in
the standings with a game in hand.
	   Italian striker Gianfranco Zola fired Chelsea ahead in the 30th
minute only for Lee Hendrie to level two minutes later.
	   The game appeared headed for a tie but Flo, who came off the
bench in the 66th to replace Zola, grabbed winner with seconds
remaining.
	   It was the second time Chelsea had beaten Villa this season,
knocking the Birmingham team out of the League Cup a month ago.
This result means Villa has 30 points from 16 games, second place
Manchester United has 29 from 15 and Chelsea has 28, also from 15.

	   Dec. 8
	   Der Taggespiegel, Berlin, on verdict against former East German
coach who gave swimmers steroids:
	   Yesterday was the end of the pilot trial against state doping in
the former East Germany, and still a couple of observers falsely
assert that it was a political trial. The West, so goes the
accusation, avenges its victory over East Germany before the court.
Seldom has the argument been more absurd. Doctors and coaches were
before the court because they played unscrupulously with the health
of minors. ... More meaningful than the degree of the sentences is
that there was a verdict at all. That made clear that the criminal
methods used by the top East German functionaries has been punished
in court.
	   Dec. 8
	   Tribune de Geneve, Geneva, Switzerland, on elections in St.
Petersburg, Russia:
	   The city elections in St. Petersburg have attracted the
attention of the whole world.
	   This is partly because the assembly which is being elected, in
Russia's second city, has powers of control over the mayor, which
is still unusual in Russia.
	   But it is also because of the recent assassination of lawmaker
Galina Starovoitova, which highlights the dangerous state of
Russian politics, even in the most pro-western areas. ...
	   Once again, the West asks itself whether it should despair of
Russia ever adapting itself to the model of democracy and trade
which it has been recommending for ten years. ...
	   In relations between the West, taken aback by its victory over
Marxism, and the Russian pupil, it seems the wrong knowledge was
passed on.
	   The pupil was convinced that it must take on board the rawest
aspects of liberalism and the market economy. ...
	   Dec. 9
	   Il Giornale, Milan, Italy, on the Human Rights Declaration
anniversary:
	   The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, agreed fifty years
ago by the U.N. General Assembly, was inspired by worthy
principles. The words were to be followed by actions. This never
happened for the simple reason that the then-Soviet Union signed
the declaration in the knowledge that it did not and would not
respect it. The declaration became ever more hypocritical as many
other dictatorships were admitted to the UN. ...
	   The declaration only began to take effect when, forty years
after the agreement, with the fall of the Berlin wall.
	   Yet the United Nations refused to closely examine the situation
in communist countries.
	   We all know how difficult it is to put into practice noble
principles of such a declaration. The reasoning of international
morality is often at odds with political reasoning which is the art
of the possible, of compromise. ...
	   Human rights are sacred but the same rules must apply to
everyone.
	   Dec. 9
	   Clarin, Buenos Aires, on Venezuelan election:
	   The election of Hugo Chavez as president of Venezuela raises the
question of the unraveling of the political system in all of Latin
America and reveals the disillusionment some are feeling about
worsening social conditions that have not improved under
democratically-elected governments.
	   Venezuela began its democracy forty years ago with an unusual
pact between the two of the country's principal parties that
guaranteed an instutional stability not known in the region at that
time.
	   But, at the same time, the leaders of the country never
diversified the country's economy instead choosing to rely heavily
on its oil revenues.
	   As a result, the Venezuelan economy is highly suceptible to the
world market's price fluctations and has not diversified enough to
create jobs and allow for funds for programs of social support to
combat the rising unemployement and levels of poverty in the
country.
	   Chavez's victory also reflects the growing discontent with
Venezuela's traditional political system. But it also demonstrates
a phenomenon that is happening in other parts of the continent
where leaders with an authoritarian bent are also gaining support.

	   GRAZ, Austria (AP) _ Cristiano Zanetti and Roberto Baggio scored
in the second half-time to give Inter Milan a 2-0 victory over
Sturm Graz on Wednesday and a place in the quarterfinals of the
Champions League.
	   The victory over the winless Austrians assured Inter of winning
Group C ahead of Real Madrid, which also advanced.
	   Ronaldo, Inter's Brazilian superstar who was making a comeback
after an injury, missed a great chance in the 3rd minute after
faking Austrian defenders. With an open goal before him, Ronaldo's
shot sailed over the net.
	   Apart from Ronaldo's opportunity, both teams appeared sluggish
in the first half-time, struggling to fight bitterly cold,
subfreezing weather and a partly frozen field.
	   Ronaldo was taken out on the hour, apparently still not fully
fit for 90 minutes after his injury.
	   Only four minutes later, Zanetti scored Inter's goal, burying a
shot from nine meters from the right under the bar following a pass
from Diego Simeone.
	   Baggio, a substitute who had come in for Youri Djorkaeff ten
minutes earlier, sealed the victory in the 80th minute, netting
from close range after receiving a pass from Ze Elias.
	   A crowd of 14,000 at the Arnold Schwarzenegger stadium saw Graz
lose its fifth of six games in the group.
	   Sturm, with only one point from the previous five games, missed
several starters, including Austria's Player of the Year, Ivica
Vastic, who fell ill before the match.

Spain insists Pinochet case is matter for courts

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Britain's decision to allow Spanish
extradition proceedings against Gen. Augusto Pinochet met with
begrudging acceptance from the Spanish government Wednesday.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's government has made clear it
does not support Judge Baltasar Garzon's efforts to put the former
Chilean dictator on trial in Spain on charges of genocide,
terrorism and torture.
	   But Aznar has stated repeatedly since Pinochet was arrested in
London on Oct. 16 on a warrant from Garzon that the case was one
for the courts to decide and neither he nor his government would
interfere.
	   Spanish government spokesman Josep Pique reiterated this
Wednesday after the announcement in London by Home Secretary Jack
Straw that British courts will now process Garzon's extradition
request for Pinochet.
	   ``The government has always said, as far as Spain is concerned,
this case must remain strictly a judicial affair. It must not be
politicized,'' Pique told reporters.
	   The Aznar government has said that eight years after Pinochet
stepped down, Chile still has delicate political dynamics because
of deep divisions between supporters and critics of Pinochet, now
83.
	   Spain also has lucrative trade ties and major investments in
Chile, and Aznar is seen as eager to protect them.
	   However, the government, sticking to its official position,
reluctantly passed on Garzon's formal extradition request on Nov.
5.
	   Meanwhile human rights groups welcomed Straw's decision, which
sets the stage for months of legal wrangling in Britain as Pinochet
fights extradition.
	   ``We believe it is a coherent decision,'' said Francisco Perez,
a human rights activist who works for United Left, a political
party that had filed suit three years ago asking Judge Garzon to
charge Pinochet.
	   ``We think it is the best possible news on the 50th anniversary
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,'' Perez said.
	   ``Human rights cannot be just a matter of idle talk. The British
government and Judge Garzon are showing that one can fight against
impunity.''
	   Carlos Iriart, head of the Movement against Impunity, a key
anti-Pinochet group in Spain, said, ``we are not used to receiving
good news.''
	   Of Straw's decision, he added: ``It represents a new orientation
in international law that ends the impunity of those who have
committed human rights. Today we can say that a new era has
begun.''
	   Fernando Moran, who served as Spanish foreign minister under the
socialists in the 1980s, agreed. ``It is not important what
Pinochet says. What's important is that we are closing the century,
which has seen so many abuses of human rights, with a finishing
flourish which is the establishment of a principle of international
law.''

Chechen leader vows to catch kidnappers amid shock at beheadings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RUSLAN MUSAYEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Faced with international outrage that
threatened to isolate the territory, Chechnya's president vowed
Wednesday to track down kidnappers who beheaded four foreigners.
	   The deaths _ and the ostentatious display of the heads by the
killers _ prompted neighboring Russian regions to close off roads
into Chechnya and led to an outpouring of laments from Russian and
foreign officials.
	   ``We will take all necessary steps to solve this horrible
crime,'' Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said Wednesday.
	   The severed heads of the four men were found lined up along a
highway Tuesday outside Chechnya's capital, Grozny. Hundreds of
Chechen law enforcement officers searched for the bodies Wednesday.
	   The men _ Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf
Petschi, and Stanley Shaw of New Zealand _ were abducted Oct. 3
while working with Britain's Granger Telecom to set up a mobile
phone network for Chechnya.
	   Maskhadov said the kidnappers had panicked and decapitated the
hostages after authorities arrested one kidnapper and launched an
operation to rescue the foreigners.
	   ``The criminals brutally executed the hostages while an
operation for their release was underway,'' he said in a statement
carried by the Russian press.
	   Three Russian republics bordering Chechnya blocked off all roads
leading to and from the secessionist territory.
	   ``The Chechen republic has been sealed off from all sides,''
Magomet Khatuyev, the head of Chechnya's border service, told the
Interfax news agency.
	   Since Chechnya won de facto independence from Russia in a
1994-96 war, it has been plagued by criminal gangs and frequent
kidnappings for ransom. Most hostages have been released unharmed,
though dozens remain in captivity.
	   Hickey's sister, Deborah, 21, said her family had expected him
to be back in England by Christmas. ``Everything was going right,
everyone was very optimistic'' that the hostages would be rescued,
she told Britain's ITV.
	   ``The people that have done this to him, they deserve exactly
the same back,'' she said, fighting back tears.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair condemned the slayings as
``tragic and horrifying,'' while Foreign Minister Robin Cook
discussed the killings with his Russian counterpart Igor Ivanov in
Belgium on Wednesday.
	   British Foreign Office Minister Tony Lloyd, speaking in
parliament, cautioned against risking further lives by sending
British officials into the region to investigate.
	   Russia, meanwhile, reiterated its recommendation that foreigners
not visit Chechnya.

	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Midfielders Luis Figo and Rivaldo
scored first-half goals as Barcelona beat Brondby 2-0 in a
Champions League finale for both teams Wednesday night.
	   Both teams had already missed their chance to reach the
quarterfinal stage from Group D. Barcelona's victory came three
days after losing 2-1 to Deportivo La Coruna in the Spanish League
and it may improve Dutch coach Louis Van Gaal's chances to stay
with the club.
	   Barcelona, which is a disappointing fifth in the Spanish
standings, took the lead after only four minutes as Figo silenced a
near-capacity crowd of 40,892 at Parken Stadium that braved cold
weather with temperatures below freezing point.
	   Rivaldo made it 2-0 in the 35th minute for Barcelona, which
finished next to last in the final group D standings ahead of
Brondy.
	   Four minutes before half-time, Barca's midfielder Josep
Guardiola was ejected by referee Nikolai Lenikov of Russia after a
bad foul on a Danish player.
	   Bayern Munich, which drew Manchester United 1-1 away at Old
Trafford in the other Group D match, topped the standings. United
gained its place in the quarters by being one of the best two
runners-up.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ The Caracas stock market surged a
second day Wednesday, reaching its highest level in six months as
investors continued to show relief over President-elect Hugo
Chavez's conciliatory statements since winning election.
	   Chavez, a former coup leader, said the stock market rallied
after his election because ``we have demonstrated to the world that
we are not savages.''
	   The 19.4 percent surge in the main Caracas index on Wednesday
followed a record 22 percent hike the previous day. The exchange
was closed Monday for a holiday.
	   Investors had feared Chavez, who as an army officer in 1992
staged an unsuccessful coup attempt, would roll back free market
economic reforms and civil liberties. But his statements in the
last two days promising fiscal discipline and calling for national
reconciliation have calmed investor fears, for now.
	   Chavez's overtures to the business community also bolstered
Venezuela's currency, the bolivar, lifting it to a four-month high,
at a midrate of 565 bolivars per dollar, up from Tuesday's close of
571.75.
	   On Wednesday, Chavez appointed a 79-year-old leftist politician,
Luis Miquilena, to oversee the national police force as interior
minister.
	   He also met with President Rafael Caldera _ the first time he
visited the Miraflores presidential palace since storming it on
Feb. 4, 1992. Palace workers applauded and cheered him.
	   Caldera, 82, was catapulted to the presidency partly because of
a speech he gave immediately after Chavez's coup, asking why people
would fight for democracy when it ``can't even give them enough to
eat.''
	   ``On the fourth of February 1992 two presidents were born,''
said Chavez, who at 44 will be Venezuela's youngest president.
	   He said he met earlier with U.S. Ambassador John Maisto, who
delivered a letter of congratulations from U.S. President Bill
Clinton. Because of his coup attempt, Chavez was placed on a U.S.
list of alien undesirables barred from entering the United States.
	   ``You will confront many difficult challenges in implementing
the economic reforms you want for Venezuela,'' said Clinton's
letter, released in Spanish by Chavez's press office. ``I am sure
that your government will effectively deal with these problems
adhering to the democratic and constitutional principles that are
the emblem of Venezuelan democracy.''
	   In recent days, U.S. officials have moved to improve relations
with Chavez, whose country is the No. 1 exporter of oil to the
United States. State Department spokesman James Foley has said
heads of state normally receive diplomatic visas to visit the
United States and the government was prepared to address any such
request from Chavez.
	   ``I am completely sure that within a few weeks I will be in the
United States,'' Chavez said.

Russia's nuclear chief hails deal with Iran
</HEADLINE>

State Madeleine Albright. Picks up 4th graf pvs, `Atomic
Energy...' &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Dismissing U.S. concerns, Russia's top nuclear
official said Wednesday that Moscow would go ahead with a project
to build a nuclear reactor in Iran, but won't hand over weapons
technology.
	   Russia signed an $800 million deal with Iran in 1995 to help
build a 1,000-megawatt light-water reactor at the country's Bushehr
power plant. Last month, Iranian officials asked Moscow to conduct
a feasibility study for building another three reactors at the same
site.
	   The United States and Israel have condemned the project, saying
it might help Iran obtain technology needed to develop nuclear
weapons.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov that Russia's cooperation with Iran was ``of
major concern'' to the United States. The two spoke Wednesday
during a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels.
	   Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov on Wednesday sought to
reassure Washington, but insisted Russia would go ahead with the
project, which he said was only for peaceful purposes and would
earn the country's nuclear program much-needed cash.
	   ``Naturally, we will not forget about our international
obligations in the field of nuclear nonproliferation,'' Adamov
said. ``Iran is our neighbor, and the appearance of nuclear weapons
there is far more dangerous to us than to the United States across
the ocean.''
	   The Russian government has acknowledged that Iran has tried to
acquire technology to build weapons of mass destruction, but
insists it has foiled all such efforts.
	   The New York Times reported Tuesday that Iran had recruited five
Russian scientists who worked on Russia's germ warfare program, and
was trying to lure more from research centers in Russia and
Kazakstan.
	   Russia's Foreign Ministry and the Iranian Embassy in Moscow both
declined to comment on the report.
	   Vladimir Orlov, the head of an independent Russian think-tank
that studies Iran's weapons programs, said he couldn't confirm the
report. But he said Russia has been lax in preventing the export of
weapons technology.
	   ``The government's action in the field has been clearly
inadequate,'' said Orlov, head of the PIR-Center for Policy
Studies. ``The facilities mentioned in the report have failed to
receive sufficient financing and protection by the state.''
	   Adamov lashed out Wednesday at the United States for what he
called its biased and politicized approach to the nuclear reactor
project.
	   ``This is purely a business deal that we carry out with extreme
precision, bearing in mind its political sensitivity,'' Adamov
said. ``Since Soviet times, our greatest potential has been in the
space, aviation and nuclear fields, and now the nation should earn
money using its intellectual and industrial potential.''
	   Adamov said he took Russian nuclear specialists to Iran last
month to discuss training Iranian nuclear scientists. Russia was
ready to provide extensive training, but Adamov declined to comment
on the details, saying they were still being finalized.
	   The Iranian project and similar deals with China and India will
generate more money for Russia's cash-strapped nuclear industry
than aid programs can provide, Adamov said.
	   The United States has been providing aid to Russian scientists
in hopes they will not be tempted to sell their expertise to
countries that want to develop nuclear arms and weapons of mass
destruction.
	   The U.S. Energy Department recently announced a plan aimed at
creating new jobs at Russia's 10 nuclear research centers.

Canseco reaches agreement with Devil Rays
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Florida (AP) _ The Tampa Bay Devil Rays
addressed a need for right-handed power hitting, signing free agent
outfielder Jose Canseco on Wednesday.
	   Canseco hit a career-high 46 home runs for Toronto last season
and reportedly sought a three- or four-year deal worth more than
dlrs 6 million per season to return to the Blue Jays.
	   Toronto only offered a one-year deal for dlrs 3 million. He
rejected the proposal, and agent Juan Iglesias began discussion
with the Devil Rays, who were high on Canseco's preferred list of
destinations because Tampa Bay is close to his home in Miami.
	   Despite playing in hitter-friendly Tropicana Field, the Devil
Rays only hit 111 homers in their inaugural season.

Champions Cup: Panathinaikos 1, Arsenal 3
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Croatian midfielder Aljosa Asanovic scored
an own goal and Nicolas Anelka and Luis Boa Morte added two others
as Arsenal beat Panathinaikos Athens 3-1 Wednesday in a Group E
game for the Champions League.
	   With its victory, Arsenal completed its matches with a total of
eight points, three behind Dynamo Kiev which finished first in the
group and advanced to the quarter finals of the competition.
	   Despite the absence of many key players, Arsenal was more
aggressive in the opening minutes, forcing Panathinaikos' Polish
goalminder Jozef Wandzik to make at least two spectacular saves.
	   In the 19th minute, Angelos Bassinas' powerful shot went just
wide scraping past David Seaman's left upright.
	   Panathinaikos missed another scoring opportunity in the 34th
when Polish striker Krzysztof Warzycha face-to-face with Seaman
shot on the British goalie.
	   One minute into the second period, Anelka had a shot on
Panathinaikos' bar.
	   The visitors gained a free kick outside the area in the 65th.
Alberto Mendez's shot deflected on Asanovic to give the Arsenal a
1-0 lead.
	   Polish striker Igor Sypniewski, who replaced Blendar Kola in the
55th, levelled for the hosts in the 73rd.
	   But seven minutes later, Anelka gave Arsenal again the lead, and
	   Boa Morte made the final 3-1 in the 86th minute.
	   As Panathinaikos fans were leaving the Athens Olympic stadium at
the end if the game, a teenager died when he fell more than 40
meters from the top of the stands to the concrete below.
	   Police said that the death of Costas Tsakos, 16, appeared to be
an accident.

Russia has tough words for NATO despite warming relations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Russia, the superpower emeritus of
Europe, warned NATO on Wednesday that the ultimate authority for
military action beyond the alliance's borders is the United
Nations.
	   Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said that since the creation of the
Russia-NATO Permanent Joint Council in 1996, the former enemies
have made great progress in dealing with their differences and
finding areas for cooperation.
	   ``We have come a long way from mistrust to mutual
understanding,'' he told reporters after a meeting of the Council.
But he made no secret that serious differences remain.
	   For its part, NATO believes that continuing to cooperate despite
these differences is proof of the Council's success.
	   ``Kosovo is a good example of that,'' said NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana.
	   The Russians vehemently disagreed with NATO's decision to
threaten the use of airstrikes in Kosovo without a specific mandate
from the United Nations. At the same time, however, they continued
to work with the West to achieve a political solution and are
contributing to the task force of unarmed civilians who are now
patrolling the Serbian province and monitoring the cease-fire.
	   ``Any decision on the use of force in our view must only be
taken on the basis of Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter,'' Ivanov said.
	   The Russians have two fears. One is that if the alliance
continues to act without a U.N. mandate, then it will effectively
circumvent Russia's veto on the Security Council. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said Tuesday that NATO must be prepared to
take action beyond its borders.
	   Secondly, if the world has abandoned the principle of
non-interference in the internal affairs of countries, what
standards will be used and who will apply them?
	   A number of the ministers explained to Ivanov at length the
reasoning behind NATO's action in Kosovo. They said there was no
attempt to circumvent the United Nations, but that when the U.N.
route became blocked, NATO had no choice but to act if it was to
avert a humanitarian disaster.
	   ``We did try very hard today to explain why the Russians should
not worry,'' said one participant in the meeting, who spoke on
condition he not be identified.
	   On Tuesday, foreign ministers began updating NATO's strategic
concept, the military and political doctrine that guides the
alliance. This strategy has in recent years turned away from
defense against a Russian onslaught in Central Europe to facing
such threats as regional conflicts, ethnic violence, terrorism and
weapons of mass destruction.
	   Russia is watching this process closely.
	   ``We cannot be indifferent to the plans and decisions taken by
NATO,'' said Ivanov. ``We've described our point of view on some
points that are being discussed now.''
	   He was adamant about the role of the United Nations.
	   ``The main decision-making body remains the United Nations,'' he
said. ``NATO should keep this in mind while discussing its
strategic concept.''
	   NATO continues to keep its forces on alert for intervention in
Kosovo should Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic abandon the
cease-fire.
	   ``Today, there is no threat of humanitarian catastrophe in
Kosovo,'' Ivanov said. ``As to (the NATO forces), our position has
not changed. The question now is in the dimension of political
negotiations.''

Rights group: Body of missing Iranian writer found
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The body of a prominent Iranian writer
missing since last week was found Wednesday in a Tehran morgue, an
international human rights group said, adding that he appeared to
have been murdered.
	   The New York-based Human Rights Watch said morgue workers
reported the presence of Mohammed Mokhtari's body to his family.
	   Mokhtari's family or government officials in Iran could not
immediately be reached for comment.
	   Marks on Mokhtari's head and neck indicated that he had been
murdered, possibly by strangulation, although no autopsy has yet
been carried out, the Human Rights Watch said in a statement faxed
to The Associated Press in Cairo, Egypt.
	   This was the latest in a series of deaths under suspicious
circumstances of prominent critics of the Iranian government, the
statement said.
	   It said Mokhtari, who was last seen alive last Thursday while
going to a shop, was briefly arrested with five other writers in
October 1998.
	   The writer's association to which he belongs wrote a letter to
authorities asking them to look into his disappearance.
	   Increasingly, hard-line rivals of moderate President Mohammad
Khatami are resorting to violence to deal with opponents. Over the
past year, vigilantes have attacked dissidents, liberal newspapers
and even a reformist Cabinet minister.
	   None of the thugs has been arrested, leading to suspicions they
are backed by powerful hard-line clerics like spiritual leader Ali
Khamenei and Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, the head of the judiciary.
	   Last month the head of an Iranian opposition group, Dariush
Foruhar, and his wife Parvaneh were stabbed to death in their home.
	   Police have said they've made several arrests in the murders of
the Foruhars, after Khatami condemned the killings and ordered an
investigation. So far, the findings have not been made public.

Juventus squeezes into last eight

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Juventus gained its first win in six attempts and
squeezed into the last eight of the European Champions Cup on
Wednesday.
	   Finalist for the last three seasons, La Juve downed Norway's
Rosenborg 2-0 and had some help from already-eliminated Athletic
Bilbao, which downed Galatasaray 1-0 in another Group B game to
knock the Turks out.
	   Juventus had tied all its previous five matches but wound up
tying both Galatasaray and Rosenborg on points and advances on the
basis of head-to-head results against the other two.
	   Juventus joins Bayern Munich, Kaiserslautern, Dynamo Kiev, Inter
Milan and Olympiakos of Greece as group winners while defending
titlist and seven-time winner Real Madrid and Manchester United got
through as the best two runners up. The draw will be December 16.
	   Ajax Amsterdam, winner four seasons ago and runner up a year
later, won't be in it. The Dutch team, a four-time titlist, went
out after losing 3-0 at FC Porto.
	   Filippo Inzaghi and Nicola Amoruso grabbed the first half goals
to take Juventus into the last eight while Julen Guerrero's strike
for Bilbao a minute before half time downed the Turks.
	   ``We hope this is a positive sign,'' said Juventus coach
Marcello Lippi, whose club is struggling in the Italian league and
has lost top striker Alessandro Del Piero for the rest of the
season because of a serious knee injury.
	   ``These have been very, very difficult months, but this might
turn the tables.''
	   Goals by Argentine midfielder Javier Zanetti and Italian
superstar Roberto Baggio powered Inter to a 2-0 victory at last
place Sturm Graz while Raul Gonzalez and Savio netted for Real
Madrid against Moscow Dynamo.
	   Those results meant that Inter and Real stayed first and second
in Group C, the Spanish team going through with the best record of
the second place finishers.
	   Manchester United took the lead against Bayern Munich at Old
Trafford through Roy Keane but Bosnian forward Hasan Salihamidzic
replied for a 1-1 tie that took both teams through. Bayern finished
top while unbeaten United had the second best record of the runners
up.
	   Although the two teams created plenty of chances in the game,
they played keep-ball in the last five minutes when they knew a tie
would take them both into the last eight.
	   Dynamo Kiev gained a 3-1 win at Lens to top Group E with goals
by Kakha Kaladze, Vladyslav Vashchuk and Andriy Shevchenko after
the French champion had captain Frederic Dehu sent off for bringing
down a goalbound Shevchenko. The Lens players protested the Kiev
star took a dive.
	   Olympiakos finished top of Group A after a 1-1 tie at Croatia
Zagreb. Stelios Giannacopoulos leveled for the Greek champion after
Josko Jelicic's goal for Croatia had given the home team hope.
	   Ajax was buried by two goals for Porto by Slovenian forward
Zlatko Zahovic and one by Ljubimko Drulovic.
	   German champion Kaiserslautern had already guaranteed a place in
the last eight and celebrated with a 4-2 win over Finland's HJK
Helsinki with three goals from Uwe Rosler.
	   There was some joy for some of the teams already out.
	   Injury-hit Arsenal, without eight of its regular starters
through injury and suspension, gained a 3-1 win at Panathinaikos
while Barcelona, going through a rough spell domestically and in
European competition, gained a 2-0 win at Denmark's Brondy with
goals by Portuguese midfielder Luis Figo and Brazilian star
Rivaldo.
	   Benfica striker Nuno Gomez scored twice in a 2-2 tie at PSV
Eindhoven in Group F but both teams slid out. Russian defender
Dmitri Khokhlov and in-form forward Ruud van Nistelrooy replied for
the Dutch team.

<TEXT>
	   BILBAO, Spain (AP) _ Athletic Bilbao played spoiler in the
Champions League Wednesday, beating Galatasaray 1-0 to keep the
Turkish team from advancing to the quarter finals.
	   Bilbao, already eliminated from contention, got its goal in the
43rd minute from Julen Guerrero.
	   It was the Basque team's only victory in its first appearance in
Europe's most elite soccer tournament.
	   Galatasaray was sluggish throughout the first half of what was
billed at home as one of the biggest games in the history of
Turkish soccer.
	   Bilbao squandered a good chance to make it 2-0 early in the
second half as Santiago Ezquerro squared off against Turkish goalie
Claudio Taffarel but failed to put the ball past him.
	   The Turks appeared increasingly desperate as the game wore on
and their play bordered on sloppy. Their best chance to score was a
header by Okan Buruk that sailed high in the final minutes.

Britain's ruling against Pinochet divides Chileans anew

	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Tears welling in her eyes, the leader of
a group whose relatives disappeared during Gen. Augusto Pinochet's
rule praised Britain's decision Wednesday to let Spain begin steps
to extradite the former dictator.
	   ``It's not only important for us and our loved ones, but for all
of mankind,'' said Viviana Diaz, whose father, Victor, a top
Communist Party official, disappeared in 1974 after his arrest by
Pinochet's secret police.
	   It is time for Pinochet to ``finally respond before a court for
his crimes,'' Ms. Diaz said.
	   But although Ms. Diaz and the relatives of others who were
killed or disappeared during Pinochet's 17-year rule celebrated
Wednesday's decision, others expressed anger and sorrow.
	   The mixed reaction reflected the deep divisions in Chile about
Pinochet. The former dictator's Oct. 16 arrest in a London
hospital, where he was recovering from back surgery, set off days
of street protests by his supporters and detractors.
	   There were no demonstrations Wednesday after British Home
Secretary Jack Straw's ruling. However, Chile's government
immediately withdrew its ambassador in protest.
	   Interior Minister Raul Troncoso insisted there were no plans to
sever or suspend ties with Britain, and he appealed for calm,
urging Chileans to guard against ``impassioned reactions.''
	   Troncoso called the ruling a violation of Pinochet's immunity as
a Chilean senator and vowed the government would ``use all the
means possible to have this decision reversed.''
	   Chilean President Eduardo Frei, who was in Brazil for a trade
conference, said his country would appeal the decision, but he
called on relatives to be calm and ``not to be overtaken by
passion.''
	   Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza, who was with Frei in
Brazil, said the appeal would be filed by next week at the latest.
But, he said, he did not think the extradition proceedings would
undermine Chile's diplomatic relations with England or Spain.
	   Spain wants Pinochet to face charges of genocide, kidnapping and
torture in the deaths or disappearances of more than 3,000 people
during Pinochet's 1973-90 rule, including dozens of Spaniards.
	   Chilean radio and television suspended regular programming to
broadcast Wednesday's decision, and word of the ruling spread
quickly.
	   The Pinochet Foundation, a private organization of retired
military officers and Pinochet supporters, reacted with anger at
the prospect that he could face months or even years of legal
battles.
	   Foundation president Hernan Briones vowed Straw's decision would
be appealed.
	   ``This is not the end of our battle,'' he said, calling the
decision ``yet another expression of Britain's colonialism and
punishment for a small country that is struggling to develop.''
	   Leftist politicians expressed mixed feelings.
	   ``This is good for justice and for human rights, but bad for
Chile and its stability,'' said socialist congressman Patricio
Hales.
	   Sen. Gabriel Valdes, who was persecuted and jailed under
Pinochet, called the decision ``very bad news for Chile because it
violates our sovereignty. It harms our democracy.''
	   Right-wing congressman Victor Perez angrily termed the decision
an escalation of the ``socialist aggression'' against Chile and the
former dictator.
	   ``This decision shows not only the new violation of Chile's
sovereignty but also the total lack of influence of our government.
Britain simply didn't pay any attention to the government's efforts
on behalf of Pinochet,'' he said.
	   The army, which Pinochet commanded for a quarter of a century
until March, called the decision ``an abusive, humiliating measure,
contrary to basic judicial principles.''
	   The civilian defense minister, Jose Florencio Guzman, said he
did not expect any problems, however, within the armed forces.

Frei: Chile will appeal Pinochet extradition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAROLD OLMOS
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Chile will appeal Britain's
decision to allow Spain to begin extradition proceedings against
former dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet, Chilean President Eduardo
Frei said on Wednesday.
	   Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said the appeal
would be filed by next week, at the latest.
	   Britain ruled Wednesday that Spain can start extradition
proceedings against Pinochet on charges of human rights violations,
torture and kidnapping by his security forces during his 17-year
rule.
	   Frei and Insulza were in Rio for a summit of the countries that
make up the Mercosur trade bloc _ Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and
Uruguay. Chile and Bolivia are associate members.
	   The six presidents, who were to discuss mainly trade issues,
focused most of their attention on Britain's decision.
	   Frei said he strongly rejected the British decision, but he
called on Chileans to remain calm and to support his government's
efforts to prevent Pinochet from being extradited. He also called
on relatives of the former dictator to ``not to be overtaken by
passion.''
	   Insulza said Pinochet should be tried in Chile, but he did not
think the extradition proceedings would undermine Chile's
diplomatic relations with England or Spain.
	   ``Pinochet has become a symbol,'' Insulza said. ``He is not the
only one in the world responsible for human rights violations.''
	   Earlier, Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said he
was opposed to ``all dictatorships and dictators'' but that he
defends the judicial sovereignty of countries, according to
presidential spokesman Sergio Amaral.
	   A document signed by the presidents at the summit rejected the
unilateral and extra-territorial application of national laws that
violate a nation's sovereignty.
	   But at the same time the six countries supported the progress of
international laws regarding an individual's accountability for
``crimes of international dimension.''
	   Insulza said he was ``in total agreement'' with that statement.

Arsenal stops Panathinaikos 3-1

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Croatian midfielder Aljosa Asanovic scored
an own goal and Nicolas Anelka and Luis Boa Morte added two others
as Arsenal beat Panathinaikos Athens 3-1 Wednesday in a Group E
game for the Champions League.
	   With its victory, Arsenal completed its matches with a total of
eight points, three behind Dynamo Kiev which finished first in the
group and advanced to the quarter finals of the competition.
	   Despite the absence of many key players, Arsenal was more
aggressive in the opening minutes, forcing Panathinaikos' Polish
goalminder Jozef Wandzik to make at least two spectacular saves.
	   In the 19th minute, Angelos Bassinas' powerful shot went just
wide scraping past David Seaman's left upright.
	   Panathinaikos missed another scoring opportunity in the 34th
when Polish striker Krzysztof Warzycha face-to-face with Seaman
shot on the British goalie.
	   One minute into the second period, Anelka had a shot on
Panathinaikos' bar.
	   The visitors gained a free kick outside the area in the 65th.
Alberto Mendez's shot deflected on Asanovic to give the Arsenal a
1-0 lead.
	   Polish striker Igor Sypniewski, who replaced Blendar Kola in the
55th, levelled for the hosts in the 73rd.
	   But seven minutes later, Anelka gave Arsenal again the lead, and
	   Boa Morte made the final 3-1 in the 86th minute.
	   As Panathinaikos fans were leaving the Athens Olympic stadium at
the end if the game, a teenager died when he fell more than 40
meters from the top of the stands to the concrete below.
	   Police said that the death of Costas Tsakos, 16, appeared to be
an accident.

Champions Cup: Manchester United and Bayern qualify for last eight
</HEADLINE>
after 1-1 tie &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Manchester United and Bayern Munich
cruised into the quarterfinal of the European Champions Cup on
Wednesday after a 1-1 tie at OId Trafford.
	   Irish midfielder Roy Keane fired United into the lead two
minutes before half time and Bosnian forward Hasan Salihamidzic
leveled for Bayern in the 55th minute.
	   The result means that Bayern qualifies for the last eight by
finishing top of Group D and United gained its place by being one
of the best two runners up.
	   ``I felt a draw would be good enough,'' United manager Alex
Ferguson said. ``I was quite confident about that, but nevertheless
there were some nervy moments.
	   ``Bayern scored from a set-piece and they are very good at
set-pieces. They are a tremendous, efficient team with great
crossers of the ball and they put you under pressure.''
	   Playing at Old Trafford for the first time in its history,
Bayern almost fell behind in the sixth minute when David Beckham
set up a chance with a superb long pass to Ryan Giggs. Andy Cole
took possession and his shot was blocked by a defender's leg and
Dwight Yorke's follow-up drive shaved the crossbar.
	   But Giovane Elber almost gave the German team the lead in the
16th minute, his diving header from Bixente Lizarazu's leftwing
cross flashing wide of the post.
	   Cole fired inches wide in the 25th minute after a good touch on
by Giggs and then Bayern goalkeeper Oliver Kahn did well to save a
20-meter shot from the Reds' striker.
	   But United went ahead in the 43rd minute.
	   Giggs pulled a pass from almost by the left corner flag into a
big space on the edge of the Bayern area and Keane drove a low,
hard shot between Kahn and his right hand post.
	   Norwegian defender Ronny Johnsen should have made it 2-0 in the
opening minute of the second half when he completely missed the
ball in front of goal when Keane played Beckham's corner into his
path.
	   United's Danish goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel produced a brilliant
acrobatic save to keep out a well-struck drive by Sammy Kuffour in
the 54th minute and preserve his team's lead.
	   But Bayern leveled a minute later when Thomas Strunz headed on a
rightwing corner and Bosnian forward Hasan Salihamidzic forced the
ball over the line from barely two meters out.
	   Bayern almost went ahead in the 58th minute when Elber stuck out
a foot and prodded the ball over the top with only Schmeichel to
beat. At the other end Paul Scholes had a shot deflected wide and
Kahn made a good save from Dwight Yorke's overhead shot.
	   A glancing header from Cole went wide and Scholes fired too high
as United threatened again as both teams created chances even
though, with the score at 1-1, they were both headed for the
quarterfinal.
	   When news of other scores in the competition filtered through to
the players, both teams played keep-ball in the final five minutes,
knowing that a tie was good enough.

Libya warns against making Lockerbie suspects political scapegoats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) _ Libya's justice minister on Wednesday said
the two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner should
not become victims of Western politics when they go on trial.
	   ``We want to be sure that the only aim of the trial is to show
the truth ... and that it is held without a political or security
background,'' Justice Minister Mohammed Belgasim al-Zuwiy said.
	   He was addressing the General People's Congress, or Parliament,
which opened a debate that will decide the fate of the two men who
are wanted in connection with the Dec. 21, 1988, bombing. A total
of 270 people on board and on ground were killed when the jetliner
blew up over the Scottish town of Lockerbie.
	   Libya has accepted in principle to a trial before a panel of
Scottish judges in the Netherlands. But the handover of the
suspects has been held up because of Libya's demand for a guarantee
that the two men, if convicted, will be jailed in Libya.
	   The United States and Britain insist that the two suspects serve
their prison term in Britain.
	   The Parliament meeting, expected to last five days, is being
held in the northern coastal town of Sirte and was broadcast live
on national television.
	   Libyan media have suggested that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi
does not have the authority to hand over the suspects and that any
decision would have to be approved by the Congress.
	   Al-Zuwiy said Libya is seeking the guarantees from the West to
ensure that the trial will be ``honest, just ... and without
loopholes that (would) leave our citizens in illegal, unjust and
inappropriate circumstances.''
	   Opening the debate, Foreign Minister Omar al-Muntasser gave the
background to the controversy over sanctions imposed by the U.N.
Security Council in 1992 to force Libya to hand over the Lockerbie
suspects for trial.
	   The sanctions included a ban on air travel from and to Libya,
restricting diplomatic personnel and banning the purchase of oil
equipment.
	   Al-Zuwiy, the justice minister, said the two suspects should
have the right to an appeal if convicted.
	   On Saturday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan met with Gadhafi
to iron out the details. No agreement was reached but Annan said
Libya is expected to reach a decision soon.

Spain insists Pinochet case is matter for courts

socialist minister. &QL; 
 &UR; With Britain-Pinochet, Chile-Pinochet &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain's government begrudgingly accepted
Britain's decision Wednesday to allow Spanish extradition
proceedings against Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's government has made clear it
does not support Judge Baltasar Garzon's efforts to try the former
Chilean dictator on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture.
	   Since Pinochet was arrested in London on Oct. 16 on a warrant
from Garzon, however, Aznar has stated repeatedly that the case was
one for the courts to decide _ and that neither he nor his
government would interfere.
	   Spanish government spokesman Josep Pique reiterated this
Wednesday after the announcement in London by Home Secretary Jack
Straw that British courts will now process Garzon's extradition
request for Pinochet.
	   ``The government has always said, as far as Spain is concerned,
this case must remain strictly a judicial affair. It must not be
politicized,'' Pique told reporters.
	   The Aznar government has said that eight years after Pinochet
stepped down, Chile still has delicate political dynamics because
of deep divisions between supporters and critics of Pinochet, now
83.
	   Spain also has lucrative trade ties and major investments in
Chile, and Aznar is seen as eager to protect them.
	   However, the government, sticking to its official position,
reluctantly passed on Garzon's formal extradition request on Nov.
5.
	   Meanwhile human rights groups welcomed Straw's decision, which
sets the stage for months of legal wrangling in Britain as Pinochet
fights extradition.
	   ``We believe it is a coherent decision,'' said Francisco Perez,
a human rights activist who works for United Left, a political
party that had filed suit three years ago asking Judge Garzon to
charge Pinochet.
	   ``We think it is the best possible news on the 50th anniversary
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,'' Perez said.
	   ``Human rights cannot be just a matter of idle talk. The British
government and Judge Garzon are showing that one can fight against
impunity.''
	   Carlos Iriart, head of the Movement against Impunity, a key
anti-Pinochet group in Spain, said, ``we are not used to receiving
good news.''
	   Of Straw's decision, he added: ``It represents a new orientation
in international law that ends the impunity of those who have
committed human rights. Today we can say that a new era has
begun.''
	   Fernando Moran, who served as Spanish foreign minister under the
socialists in the 1980s, agreed.
	   ``It is not important what Pinochet says,'' Moran said. ``What's
important is that we are closing the century, which has seen so
many abuses of human rights, with a finishing flourish which is the
establishment of a principle of international law.''

Centennial of America's 'Splendid Little War' gets scant attention
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish-American War Centennial year is
slipping by with little fanfare other than a U.S. commemorative
stamp despite its historical significance for the United States,
Spain and the islands they fought over.
	   The Treaty of Paris that ended the conflict was signed on Dec.
10, 1898, 100 years ago Thursday.
	   Under the treaty Spain handed over Cuba, Puerto Rico and the
Philippines, the last vestiges of its already crumbling empire. For
the United States, victory demonstrated to the world its potential
as a global power.
	   ``There are black years, and 1898 was as black as the ink that
signed the surrender treaties,'' the newspaper Heraldo de Aragon
lamented in its New Year's edition a few weeks after the signing.
	   Spain's wounded pride has now healed, and a handful of
anniversary year commemorations, mostly art exhibitions and
academic seminars, looked on the bright side: a cultural flowering
inspired by the end of the empire.
	   The group of writers, philosophers, scientists and artists known
as the Generation of 98 created one of the most dynamic periods in
Spanish culture.
	   ``Defeat forged the image of a dead and powerless nation and
encouraged a profound pessimism, but there was also a sense of
relief from the impossible task of keeping the empire,'' Spanish
historian Santos Julia said in an interview.
	   Although he views the collapse of a 400-year-old empire as key
to modern Spanish history, Sebastian Balfour from the London School
of Economics believes the trauma has now been overcome.
	   ``The symbol of 1898 and the bitterness it caused were buried
under the wave of modernization that swept Spain in the 60s and
70s,'' he said in a telephone interview.
	   Newly confident and bolstered by major international companies
in telecommunications, energy, tourism and banking, Spain has today
embarked on a commercial ``reconquest'' by investing heavily in its
former colonies.
	   Meanwhile, in the U.S. commemorations of 1898 have focused on
the sinking of the USS Maine in Havana harbor on Feb. 15, killing
267 officers and sailors.
	   A commemorative stamp was issued, and memorial services and
exhibitions held around the U.S. and even in Cuba paying tribute to
the battleship enshrined in the American collective consciousness
by the battle cry ``Remember the Maine!''.
	   Although the cause of the ship's destruction has always been
disputed, 100 years ago the war-thirsty ``yellow press'' insisted
on blaming the ``perfidious Spanish,'' and so increased the
pressure on the U.S. government to go to war.
	   But beyond the Maine, the centennial of what President Teddy
Roosevelt called ``a splendid little war'' has gone virtually
unnoticed by Americans.
	   ``One of the conflicts with the greatest implications for
Americans even today has all but faded from the modern American
mind,'' wrote historian Patrick McSherry on the half finished
Spanish-American War Centennial website.
	   The war lasted less than four months, from April 25 to Aug. 12.
Only 332 Americans died in battle, although another 2,957 died from
diseases. The Spaniards lost 65,000 soldiers and sailors, 60,000 of
them to disease. The big killer was yellow fever.
	   The Americans fought in the name of freeing the Spanish
Caribbean and Pacific from the shackles of arcane Spanish
colonialism. Their troops were somewhat welcomed by independence
forces in all three colonies.
	   But Joseph Smith, who teaches U.S. history at Exeter University,
says the war ``soon became a bit embarrassing,'' because of the
ambiguous U.S. attitude toward colonialism, an uprising and
subsequent war in the Philippines and ongoing, delicate relations
with Cuba.
	   Spain and the United States are both happy to keep the forgotten
war forgotten and enjoy excellent bilateral relations.
	   ``The disaster freed the Spaniards of the need to go on hating
the Americans,'' Julia said, insisting that relations normalized
immediately after the Treaty of Paris.
	   For the Philippines, there was little to celebrate until 1946,
when the United States finally granted independence. Its first
declaration of independence was celebrated this year, not the war
that brought the Americans.
	   Puerto Rico observed the 100th anniversary of the U.S. invasion
with an official ceremony. But attention was focused more this year
on the war's legacy: the never-ending ``status debate'' as
preparations moved forward for a plebiscite on three choices:
continued commonwealth, statehood or independence.
	   Cuba, as it has for years, commemorated the deaths of its
independence heroes and ignored the U.S. role in getting rid of the
Spaniards.
	   One hundred years after the U.S. navy quashed the Spanish armada
in the name of Cuban independence, a visit to the Caribbean island
by a U.S. president is unthinkable.
	   Spain, on the other hand, will send King Juan Carlos on his
first visit to Cuba in the spring to show just how good relations
are between the former imperial power and the colony it signed away
to the United States.

Puerto Rico statehood advocate suing for `first-class' citizenship

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ David Efron was born in Cuba, moved
to the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico when he was 8 and was
naturalized a few years later, making him a full citizen of the
United States.
	   His daughter Jennifer, 14, is a U.S. citizen by her birth in
Puerto Rico. But the island's peculiar status makes her citizenship
``statutory'' and revocable by Congress, maintains Efron, a
supporter of making Puerto Rico the 51st state.
	   Supporters of the current ``commonwealth'' arrangement deny that
Puerto Ricans' citizenship is in any danger, and the issue has
become a central one in the status referendum to be held Sunday.
	   Over the past two years, Efron has poured tens of thousands of
dollars into a lawsuit demanding that the U.S. government
naturalize Jennifer _ seemingly redundant for someone who is
already a citizen.
	   ``I want my daughter to have a first-class, non-revocable type
of citizenship,'' said Efron, a lawyer and real estate developer
who divides his time between San Juan and Miami, where his family
has lived for 12 years.
	   But his real goal is to get the U.S. court system to formally
rule that the citizenship of Puerto Ricans is indeed revocable
under commonwealth.
	   The issue dates to the 1917 Jones Act, when Congress
unilaterally declared that Puerto Ricans ``shall be deemed and held
to be citizens of the United States.''
	   That citizenship was kept when Puerto Rico became a
``commonwealth'' in 1952. So Puerto Ricans can travel, live and
work in the mainland freely, even while enjoying trappings of
nationhood like their own Olympic team.
	   In the current campaign, statehood supporters have tried to sell
the change _ which many here fear would erode the island's Hispanic
culture _ as the only guarantor of citizenship.
	   Ivan Ortiz, local spokesman for the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service, would say only that ``as far as the INS is
concerned, a person born in Puerto Rico is a U.S. citizen.''
	   But in an recent article, former Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh said he agreed that Puerto Ricans' citizenship is
``granted by statute and not fully protected by the U.S.
Constitution.''
	   So far, the Supreme Court has not considered any case that would
clarify the issue.
	   Congress has never moved to revoke Puerto Ricans' citizenship.
But outgoing House Speaker Newt Gingrich and others have said
recently that commonwealth is not permanently acceptable,
suggesting that Puerto Rico should eventually choose between
statehood and independence.
	   In a non-binding 1993 vote, islanders narrowly preferred keeping
commonwealth.
	   Sunday's vote is again non-binding, but President Clinton has
said he hopes Congress will abide by the result.
	   The choice this time is between statehood, commonwealth,
independence, and a fourth option called ``free association,''
which is essentially independence with treaty ties.
	   The commonwealth movement has called on supporters to vote for
``none of the above,'' to protest the wording of the commonwealth
definition that suggests the citizenship can be revoked.
	   In Jennifer's case, the U.S. District Court in Southern Florida
rejected the naturalization petition, arguing there was
insufficient immediate danger that she would lose her rights.
	   The decision, however, said: ``The court notes that Congress, if
it does choose to revoke the `statutory' United States citizenship
of Puerto Ricans, may nevertheless make provisions for the
naturalization of persons, like Efron, who were granted `statutory'
United States citizenship.''
	   Efron said that wording constitutes agreement that Congress can
revoke the citizenship of the 3.8 million Puerto Ricans on the
island at some future date. Theoretically, it could also affect
those among the 2 million Puerto Ricans living on the mainland who
were born on the island.
	   ``Puerto Ricans treasure their U.S. citizenship _ but I don't
think they realize how fragile their citizenship is,'' Efron said.
	   It remains to be seen if the people of Puerto Rico agree _ but
at least one person is convinced.
	   ``My father explained it to me, and I'm afraid I can lose my
citizenship,'' Jennifer said by telephone from Miami. ``I'm, like,
American and everything, and I feel American _ but this makes me
different!''

Rights group: Body of missing Iranian writer found
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The body of a prominent Iranian writer
missing since last week was found Wednesday in a Tehran morgue, an
international human rights group said, adding that he appeared to
have been murdered.
	   The New York-based Human Rights Watch said morgue workers
reported the presence of Mohammed Mokhtari's body to his family.
	   Mokhtari's family or government officials in Iran could not be
reached for immediate comment.
	   Marks on Mokhtari's head and neck indicated that he had been
murdered, possibly by strangulation, although no autopsy has yet
been carried out, the Human Rights Watch said in a statement faxed
to The Associated Press in Cairo, Egypt.
	   This was the latest in a series of deaths under suspicious
circumstances of prominent critics of the Iranian government, the
statement said.
	   It said Mokhtari, who was last seen alive last Thursday while
going to a shop, was briefly arrested with five other writers in
October 1998.
	   The writer's association to which he belongs wrote a letter to
authorities asking them to look into his disappearance.
	   Increasingly, hard-line rivals of moderate President Mohammad
Khatami are resorting to violence to deal with opponents. Over the
past year, vigilantes have attacked dissidents, liberal newspapers
and even a reformist Cabinet minister.
	   Nobody has been charged in any of the attacks, leading to
suspicions that a campaign of violence is being backed by powerful
hard-line clerics like spiritual leader Ali Khamenei and Ayatollah
Mohammad Yazdi, the head of the judiciary.
	   Last month, the head of an Iranian opposition group, Dariush
Foruhar, and his wife Parvaneh were stabbed to death in their home.
	   Police said they've made several arrests in the murders of the
Foruhars, after Khatami condemned the killings and ordered an
investigation. But the findings have not been made public.

Libyan passengers commandeer Egyptian airliner in mid-air
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with plane flying to Yemen,
more details. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Two masked men supported by some 150 Libyan
passengers took over a chartered Egyptian airliner in mid-air
Wednesday, demanding to be flown to Libya _ a violation of U.N.
sanctions.
	   The pilot, however, landed the plane in the Tunisian resort town
of Jerba where the protesters got off. But Tunisian authorities put
the passengers back on board and the aircraft flew to Cairo, then
on to Yemen, where it had originated.
	   It was not clear if the masked men were detained in Tunisia or
also sent back.
	   None of the passengers or crew was reported injured. Officials
said many of the passengers were carrying daggers, as is the custom
among Libyan and Yemeni men, but they did not use it to threaten
the crew.
	   Libya has frequently violated the U.N. flight ban, which was
adopted in 1992 to force Libya to turn over two suspects wanted for
the bombing of a Pan Am jet over Scotland in 1988.
	   Jerba, an island 350 kilometers (210 miles) south of the
capital, Tunis, is frequently used as a transit point for travelers
going on to Libya by land without violating the sanctions.
	   The drama began early Wednesday when two masked men burst into
the cockpit of the MD-90 aircraft soon after it took off for Tunis.
They wanted the plane to fly to the Libyan capital, Tripoli,
Egyptian security officials said.
	   Many of the estimated 150 Libyans on board joined the masked
intruders and created a ruckus, the officials said quoting the
pilot who was in radio touch with Cairo airport. The officials
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   One Egyptian police official said the pilot was told by Egyptian
authorities that he could fly to Libya under duress without
violating sanctions, but the pilot apparently tricked the hijackers
and landed in Jerba, a Tunisian resort about 80 kilometers (50
miles) from Libya's northwest border.
	   Some passengers got off the plane in Jerba complaining of
exhaustion, while many others remained on board demanding that the
aircraft be refueled, the officials said. But they too left the
aircraft later, according to the officials.
	   Besides the Libyans, there were Tunisians and Yemenis on the
aircraft.
	   The aircraft was chartered by a private Egyptian company for a
flight by Libyan businessmen, the officials said. They said the
aircraft itself belongs to EgyptAir, the national carrier.

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Catcher Benito Santiago and the Chicago Cubs
agreed Wednesday to a dlrs 2 million, one-year contract with a team
option for 2000.
	   Santiago, 33, is a 12-year veteran who played in only 15 games
last season following an auto accident last January in which he
strained ligaments in his right knee. He rejoined the team in
September, batting .310 with five doubles and four RBIs in 29
at-bats.
	   ``He's 100 percent. The Cubs did their homework to make sure of
that,'' said Santiago's agent, Lonnie Cooper. ``This is where he
wanted to play. He's very comfortable with the manager and the
general manager.''
	   Santiago, Cubs manager Jim Riggleman and GM Ed Lynch all are
former employees of the San Diego Padres.
	   Santiago will give the Cubs a right-handed hitting catcher they
lost when the team did not offer salary arbitration to veteran
Scott Servais, who had become a free agent. Tyler Houston is the
Cubs' other catcher and a left-handed hitter.
	   Santiago has also played with the Padres, who signed him
initially in 1983, Florida, Cincinnati and Philadelphia. He has a
.261 career average with 163 homers and 641 RBIs.
	   A four-time All-Star, he was voted National League Rookie of the
Year in 1987, when he put together a 34-game hitting streak.
Santiago hit 30 homers in 1996, a career high.
	   Santiago gets a dlrs 1.5 million salary and the chance to earn
dlrs 500,000 in performance bonuses. Chicago's option is for dlrs
3.5 million with a dlrs 500,000 buyout.

Federal judge on Guam orders runoff election
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAGATNA, Guam (AP) _ A federal judge on Wednesday ordered a
runoff election between Guam's Gov. Carl Gutierrez and former Gov.
Joseph Ada, saying Gutierrez did not receive the necessary majority
of votes to be declared the winner.
	   U.S. District Judge John Unpingco said blank ballots should be
counted toward the vote total in the Nov. 3 general election. That
means Gutierrez did not receive the required 50 percent of the
votes cast plus one, as required by Guam's law.
	   The Guam Election Commission had certified Democrats Gutierrez
and Lt. Gov. Madeleine Bordallo as the winners after excluding
blank ballots, but Unpingco said the commission did not have the
jurisdiction to do so because it never approved the vote
percentages so ``the act was void.''
	   The judge also said that blank ballots were counted in two
previous elections.
	   Ada said Unpingco's ruling was a victory for democracy.
	   Gutierrez's lawyer said he would immediately appeal to the 9th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. He also will ask
for a temporary restraining order to prevent a runoff from being
held until his appeal is decided.
	   The Nov. 3 general election results have been surrounded by
controversy from the moment the polls closed.
	   Gutierrez and Bordallo received about 3,000 more votes than Ada
and runningmate Sen. Felix Camacho.
	   There also were 1,291 write-in votes and 1,312 ballots without
any votes for governor. Some ballots were disqualified for being
spoiled.
	   The election commission did not certify the results until nine
days later, but some Republican members said the meeting violated
the U.S. territory's open government law, so the certification may
not have been valid.
	   Also, the FBI has been investigating whether election fraud was
committed.
	   Ada, a Republican former two-term governor, said the election
was rife with ``wholesale ballot fraud.'' He charged in a Superior
Court lawsuit that votes were cast for Gutierrez by non-residents,
non-American citizens and people using the names of dead voters.
	   Guam is a U.S. territory about 3,700 miles (5,950 kilometers)
southwest of Hawaii.

Riots break out at student rally in Greece
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Rioters smashed store windows and burned
cars in Greece Wednesday during a rally by teachers and students
against education reforms.
	   People on the streets of Athens ran for cover as youths tailing
the march hurled rocks and gasoline bombs at stores and riot
police.
	   No serious injuries were reported. At least 11 people were
detained by police.
	   Joined by university students, an estimated 10,000 demonstrators
chanted slogans against Education Minister Gerasimos Arsenis. They
demanded the immediate repeal of reforms designed to change course
and grading systems at state schools and universities.
	   The protesters targeted banks, fast food restaurants and private
cars during running battles with police. One masked arsonist threw
a gasoline bomb into a McDonald's restaurant near the parliament
building.
	   Students also have blocked busy roads and occupied hundreds of
high-school buildings in a two-week campaign against the
government-mandated education reforms.
	   Teachers oppose changes in hiring policies that scrap a waiting
list system in favor of ranking according to exam results. The
students face a new university entrance system that gives more
weight to a series of tests rather than a single exam.
	   Arsenis has said the protesting students were being
``deliberately misinformed'' about the reforms by teachers and
private night schools, which most Greek children attend to keep up
with classes.
	   Greeks have a constitutional right to free schooling and
university, but education receives little public funding. Teachers
have for years been campaigning for better pay and work conditions.
	   They argue that schools are too poorly equipped for the reforms
to work.

Canadian lawmakers recommend changes to ease child-custody battles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ After months of rancorous hearings, a
parliamentary committee Wednesday recommended changes aimed at
easing bitter child-custody battles between divorced parents.
	   The thrust of the recommendations is to ensure that both parents
are involved in their children's upbringing, provided that joint
involvement is in the children's interest.
	   The committee said both parents should have access to
information on their children's development and activities, such as
school and medical records.
	   It also recommended steps to ensure that children from a broken
marriage can develop relationships with grandparents, siblings and
other extended family members.
	   The committee did not go as far as to recommend that joint
custody be a forced solution in every divorce case, as fathers'
advocates had hoped.
	   Instead, the report suggests that the current system, in which
courts are the final arbiters, should stay. But it wants the
interests of children to be put first.
	   ``It will mean that parents, post-divorce, will both be equal in
terms of their legal rights,'' said Roger Gallaway, co-chairman of
the committee. ``Children are entitled to two parents
post-divorce.''
	   Justice Minister Anne McLellan has said she would be willing to
consider changes to the Divorce Act if they improve the lot of
children.
	   Once she reviews the committee report, she would have to decide
on specific legislation to be introduced in Parliament.

	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Archie Moore, who knocked out more opponents
than anyone else in the history of boxing, died Wednesday at 84.
	   Moore's son, Billy, said his father was taken to a San Diego
Hospice about a week ago because of his poor health. The boxer's
children had kept vigil at his bedside.
	   Moore retired at 49 after a career that is considered one of the
most amazing examples of longevity in sports. He held the light
heavyweight boxing title for 11 of the 27 years he was in the ring,
knocking out 141 opponents in 228 bouts.

Lithuanian court declares death penalty unconstitutional
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ Lithuania's highest court on Wednesday
declared the country's Soviet-era death penalty unconstitutional,
saying it violated provisions against cruelty and torture, the
Baltic News Service reported.
	   The death penalty has wide backing in Lithuania, with some 80
percent of respondents in a recent poll saying they supported
capital punishment. But the law has been criticized by European
human rights groups and the European Union has said it was an
obstacle to Lithuanian membership.
	   Like virtually all other former Soviet republics, Lithuania kept
its death penalty after gaining independence in 1991. It hasn't
carried out a death sentence since 1995, but capital punishment has
remained on the books.
	   Wednesday ruling does not immediately abolish the death penalty,
but it should preclude parliament from including the capital
punishment in a new criminal code now being considered by
parliament, BNS said.
	   President Valdas Adamkus, one of the few Lithuanian politicians
who has spoken out against capital punishment, welcomed the high
court's ruling. But Stanislovas Buskevicius, a right-wing
legislator, warned that violent crime was bound to increase without
the death penalty.
	   ``Today is a victory for assassins,'' BNS quoted him as saying.

Leadbetter ends relationship with Pak
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ The complex and often confusing
relationship between David Leadbetter and Korean star Se Ri Pak
officially ended Wednesday when the swing coach said he was fed up
with dealing with innuendos about his job status.
	   Leadbetter, who just 10 days ago dispeled rumors that Pak was
leaving him and said he looked forward to helping her get to No. 1
in the world, cited ``extremely difficult circumstances'' in ending
a relationship that began two years ago.
	   ``You never know where you stand,'' Leadbetter told The
Associated Press. ``It's on again, off again, on again, off again.
I refuse to be a tennis ball. If she doesn't want to work with me,
fine. But make up your damn mind.''
	   Leadbetter said he has been unable to reach Pak but sent a
letter of his decision to ``one of her many managers.''
	   Leadbetter is most famous for rebuilding the swing that helped
Nick Faldo win six major championships, a 13-year relationship that
also ended with a letter, from Faldo. He also has worked with Nick
Price, Ernie Els and now Greg Norman.
	   ``I've never been involved with anything quite like this,''
Leadbetter said.
	   Leadbetter was hired in December 1996 by Samsung, the Korean
electronics giant and Pak's sponsor, which wanted him to help turn
Pak into one of the world's best women players.
	   The results came quickly.
	   She tied for first in the LPGA qualifying tournament, then
turned in a rookie season that took women's golf to front pages.
Pak won the LPGA Championship in May, then became the youngest
winner of the U.S. Women's Open a month later.
	   She won twice more, setting an LPGA scoring record in one
tournament, and finished the year second to Annika Sorenstam in
money and the player of the year points. Pak was voted LPGA player
of the year this week by the Golf Writers Association of America.
	   ``While Se Ri has enjoyed a fantastic year on the LPGA Tour, she
apparently is not satisfied,'' Leadbetter said. ``I sincerely hope
for Se Ri's sake that she finds the help she is looking for, not
only for her golf game but to help her balance her life.''
	   Word of their split surfaced three weeks ago during the LPGA
Tour Championship at Las Vegas, where Pak was seen working with
Butch Harmon and also played nine holes with Harmon's most famous
client _ Tiger Woods.
	   Golf World magazine cited sources as saying a deal was all but
finalized to have Pak work with Harmon, although Pak put out a
release last week saying her ``intentions were misinterpreted'' and
expressing ``great appreciation'' for Leadbetter.
	   While Leadbetter said at the time the reports were overblown, he
also said it was difficult working with a player who was controlled
by so many interests _ Samsung, her father and agents hired by
Samsung and the family.
	   ``Everybody wants a piece of her,'' he said. ``She doesn't have
a life, basically. You can see over the last few months. She used
to smile and laugh, but she's been miserable. How can you be
miserable after the year she's had?
	   ``She's definitely the most talented woman I've ever seen and
the most talented woman I've had the opportunity to work with,'' he
said. ``But she's headed for a fall.''
	   Leadbetter said he decided to quit this week after Pak asked him
to shoot video for Korean television on Monday, and then hearing
the next day that she might not work with him after next year.
	   ``Life's too short for this,'' he said. ``The first 18 months
were very enjoyable, but the last few months have been a pain.''

U.S. federal agents arrest alleged drug ring; seize dlrs 40

million &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Federal agents announced Wednesday
they arrested 30 people and seized dlrs 40 million in connection
with an alleged heroin smuggling and money-laundering ring based in
Puerto Rico.
	   A federal grand jury in San Juan indicted Ferrario Pozzi, 49,
the Italian owner of a long-distance telephone center allegedly
used to launder the money, on drug trafficking and money laundering
charges.
	   The Dominican owner of Multienvios Inc., Edna Jimenez, 38, faces
identical charges. Prosecutors claim a Colombian resident of Miami,
33-year-old Jesus Ivan Saenz, ran the ring. Both Saenz and Jimenez
were arrested Wednesday.
	   The other suspects are accused drug dealers and couriers
arrested in Puerto Rico and Florida, officials from the U.S.
Customs Service and U.S. Attorney's Office said at a news
conference in San Juan.
	   Federal prosecutors claim the ring used couriers to carry drugs
to Puerto Rico from St. Martin and Barbados on airline flights.
	   Investigators said money from drug sales was funneled through
long-distance telephone centers in San Juan that are popular with
tourists, cruise ship employees and residents who do not have
telephones in their homes. One of the three telephone centers used
was in the popular Old San Juan tourist district, investigators
said.
	   Drug dealers allegedly used the centers to wire money to banks
in Europe, Asia, the United States, and the Caribbean islands of
Barbados and St. Martin, said customs special agent Frank Figueroa.
	   The ring laundered about dlrs 50 million over two years, he
said.
	   The money seized was deposited in 64 bank accounts in Miami,
Pennsylvania, New York, Texas, California, Canada, Italy,
Switzerland, Spain, Japan, Korea, Britain and Argentina.

	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Archie Moore, who knocked out more opponents
than anyone else in the history of boxing , died Wednesday at 84.
	   Moore's son, Billy, said his father was taken to a San Diego
hospice about a week ago because of his poor health. The boxer's
children had kept vigil at his bedside.
	   Moore retired at 49 after a career that is considered one of the
most amazing examples of longevity in sports. He held the light
heavyweight title for 11 of the 27 years he was in the ring,
knocking out 141 opponents in 228 bouts.
	   ``His nickname is Ageless Archie,'' his son said. ``They named
him that because he wouldn't tell people how old he was when he
started boxing. Now, I guess it means something else _ that he will
live on forever.''
	   Moore, whose real name was Archibald Lee Wright, was born in
Benoit, Miss., on Dec. 13, 1913. He won his first professional
fight 23 years later, with a decision over Murray Allen in Quincy,
Illinois.
	   He won the light heavyweight title in 1952 at age 39 with a
victory over Joey Maxim. He successfully defended his title nine
more times, but along the way lost to heavyweight champions Rocky
Marciano, Floyd Patterson and Muhammad Ali. He was the only boxer
who fought Marciano and Ali.
	   Moore had some of his greatest battles with Harold Johnson, who
held a portion of the crown. They fought five times from 1949 to
1954 with Moore the winner all but once.
	   They met only once with the title at stake. Moore won that bout
at New York on Aug. 11, 1954, retaining his crown with a 14th-round
knockout. His other title defenses came against Bobo Olson, Yolande
Pompey, Tony Anthony, Guilio Rinaldi and twice against Yvon
Durelle.
	   Fighting in an era where fixed bouts were not uncommon, Moore
said he never took a dive. In a 1989 interview with Sports
Illustrated, Moore recalled valuable advice he received from an
aunt.
	   ``'Archie, take your rest, mind your trainer and bring no
disgrace to your family, like throwing fights,''' he quoted her as
saying.
	   Moore fought Marciano on Sept. 21, 1955, but lost on a
ninth-round knockout. It did nothing, however, to diminish his
image as one of the most courageous boxers ever.
	   Fighting an undefeated heavyweight king 10 years his junior,
Moore _ also known as the Mongoose _ floored Marciano in the second
round. Marciano eventually wore Moore down, to the point where the
referee wanted to stop the fight after eight rounds.
	   ``Oh, no,'' an exhausted Moore protested. ``I want to be counted
out. I'm a champion, too.''
	   But Moore's bloodiest fight was not his loss to Marciano, or his
wars with Johnson and Maxim. It came in 1958, in the first of his
title defenses against the Canadian Durelle.
	   Moore, who was to win on an 11th-round knockout, was floored
four times.
	   ``The first time he put me down ... I thought `Wow, this guy can
hit,''' Moore recalled. ``They said Marciano was a house wrecker,
and he was, but it took him a volley to get the job done. This guy
_ one punch.''
	   Moore was elected to the Boxing Hall of Fame in 1966, three
years after his final bout, a three-round knockout of Mike DiBiase,
and five years after he was stripped of his title by the National
Boxing Association because of politics.
	   Moore, whose trademark was a ready smile and knee-length boxing
trunks, traveled the world as an ambassador for the sport and spent
much of his retirement telling young boys to stay away from drugs.
	   The champion had a soft spot for youth, having spent 22 months
in a reformatory. His expertise was sought by President Eisenhower,
who invited Moore to the White House to join a group fighting
juvenile delinquency.
	   Eisenhower aides quoted the president as saying Moore should be
a congressman. ``Are you a Republican or a Democrat?'' he said.
	   ``Neither,'' Moore said with a laugh. ``I'm a diplomat.''

Hunter tells agents there will be a season
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Wednesday's developments &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Don't worry, there will be a National Basketball
Association season. At least that's what Billy Hunter was saying
Wednesday.
	   With his constituents growing increasingly nervous that the
lockout may indeed force the cancellation of the entire season,
Hunter tried to soothe the mood on a conference call with about 80
agents, some of whom were skeptical.
	   ``The union's negotiating team thinks there's another deal that
will come rolling in, and I don't see it. There's no reason for
confidence,'' said agent Harold McDonald, who represents Derrick
Coleman and Terry Mills.
	   ``The union should not sacrifice the earnings of the present
players for the sake of future players,'' said Norman Blass, who
represents Mookie Blaylock, Keith Askins and Derrick McKey.
	   The conference call lasted about 1 1/2 hours, and about 20
questions were posed to Hunter and union attorney Ron Klempner,
according to several people who participated in the call.
	   Among the topics discussed were the details of each side's
proposal on how to divide a projected dlrs 2 billion in revenue,
the owners' rejection of a mediator, the lack of sympathy the
players have gotten from the public, the exhibition game next
weekend in Atlantic City, and the prospects for forming a new
league.
	   As for the biggest question of all _ Will there be a season? _
Hunter was confident that the answer will be yes.
	   ``Billy's message was that as long as the players hold together
there will be a season,'' said agent Don Cronson, who represents
Anthony Mason, Jamal Mashburn and Mark Jackson. ``The sides are not
as far apart as people think, and management will have to come in
and really start negotiating _ talking about some of the things
that are important to us.''
	   ``What's going on here is that there are people afraid of losing
the season, but there's not much you can do. This is a David Stern
production with the goal of getting into December, making players
miss multiple paychecks and having them sweat,'' Cronson said.
	   For another day, there was no contact between Hunter and Stern.
It has been one week since the last negotiating session, and no new
talks are planned.
	   Stern has refused to set a date when it would be too late to
save the season, saying it will expire of its own accord in the not
too distant future.
	   That has left everyone wondering when the expiration date is.
	   Hunter has said it's Jan. 1, and others have said it could be as
late as Jan. 10. About five weeks would be needed from the time a
deal was reached in principle until the date the season could
start. It would take about two weeks to put the agreement in
writing and another three weeks to sign free agents, make trades
and hold training camps.
	   On Tuesday, after he canceled the All-Star game, Stern left the
door open just the slightest bit when he was asked if the season
could begin at the All-Star break in mid-February.
	   ``No, I don't think so, but I am going to leave that to the
Board of Governors,'' Stern said. ``But my personal view is no, not
at all. I don't think we would ever do that.''
	   If the season did start Feb. 12 and went until the end of April,
each team could play about 42 games.
	   Stern and deputy commissioner Russ Granik had previously said
having less than 50 games would be unacceptable. But Granik
recently admitted that if it was a choice between playing
40-something games and playing none, he'd choose the 40-something.
	   Stern and Granik have repeatedly denied that they are trying to
wear down the players' resolve, insisting they are only trying to
get a fair deal for the owners.

Commission: Government should pay compensation for post-war
</HEADLINE>
insensitivity to Jews &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The government should pay 48
million guilders (dlrs 25 million) to Dutch Jewish organizations as
compensation for its insensitive treatment of Holocaust survivors
after World War II, an independent commission said in a report
published Wednesday.
	   During the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands, Jews were forced
to pay for the construction of two camps where they were held
before being deported to death camps like Auschwitz and
Bergen-Belsen. After the war, the government repaid only a fraction
of the money.
	   ``The (Dutch) camps ... were the gateways to camps like
Auschwitz,'' said commission leader Frans Kordes. ``This must be
put right.''
	   Jews also had to pay for the return of their stolen belongings
from Germany, Kordes said as he presented his report to Dutch
Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm.
	   After the war ``there was not enough feeling shown for what
these people had been through,'' Kordes said. His report described
the treatment of returning Jews as ``inhumane.''
	   Zalm had no immediate comment on the sums of money involved,
Dutch television news reported.
	   A prominent Dutch Jewish group criticized the proposals for not
going far enough.
	   ``The problem is that individual claims are considered no longer
valid,'' said Ronny Naftaniel, a spokesman for the Center for
Information and Documentation on Israel.
	   About three-quarters of Dutch Jews _ more than 100,000 people _
died in the Holocaust.

Downer to urge Pacific solidarity on fishing monitoring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Foreign Minister Alexander Downer
will use a South Pacific visit to urge island leaders to stand firm
against Asian pressure and demand satellite monitoring of foreign
fishing vessels.
	   Downer flies Thursday to Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands,
Kiribati, Tuvalu and Fiji in his fourth visit to the region as
foreign minister.
	   Australia wants satellite-monitoring equipment a licensing
condition for foreign fishing vessels.
	   Elements among the fishing fleets of China, Taiwan, South Korea
and Japan oppose installing monitoring equipment in all vessels.
	   The proposed system could collapse without support of the island
nations, a Foreign Affairs Department spokesman said.
	   During the nine-day visit, Downer will urge members of the Forum
Fisheries Agency, which includes Australia and New Zealand, to
abide by their recent agreement on a vessel monitoring system.
	   ``There has been quite serious pressure from some of the distant
water fishing nations against that proposal,'' the source said,
speaking on the customary condition of anonymity.
	   ``They don't want to be monitored and, in some cases, they have
used the threat that they will withdraw from the zone of a
particular country or they have demanded that the cost of
installing the equipment be deducted from the licenses they paid.''
	   Downer begins his trip Thursday night in Port Moresby, where he
will dine with Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Bill Skate and
ministers.
	   While there, he will open a hospital and airstrip on Buka
Island, both completed with Australian government assistance as
part of the Bougainville rehabilitation program.
	   Downer also intended to use his visit to discuss with Solomon
Islands Prime Minister Ulufa'alu ways of taking the Bougainville
peace process further.
	   The minister will also attend the annual Australia Fiji
ministerial talks in Nadi on Dec. 18, where issues will include 1
billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 620 million) bilateral trade.
	   Downer will also use his trip to launch Australia's new Pacific
Islands Development Strategy, the first comprehensive three-year
strategy for Australia's aid to the island countries.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ In a historic drama played out in the shadow
of the Capitol, House Judiciary Committee Republicans drew up four
proposed articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton on
Wednesday. All cited his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky
and the long campaign to cover it up. Republicans cited Clinton on
two counts of perjury, one count of obstruction of justice and one
of abuse of power _ all adding up to ``high crimes and
misdemeanors,'' the draft articles said. Rep. Henry Hyde, the
panel's chairman, vowed to press for a vote by week's end.
Committee approval would set the stage for a vote in the House next
week, thus making Clinton only the second president in American
history to suffer the humiliation of an impeachment roll call in
Congress. (US-CLINTON-IMPEACHMENT)
	   LONDON (AP) _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet is fit to stand trial on
charges of genocide and Spain can start extradition proceedings
against him, Britain ruled Wednesday, delighting human rights
groups and leaving the 83-year-old former Chilean dictator to face
a long legal battle. Chile immediately withdrew its ambassador in
protest and promised to appeal the decision, pushing
already-strained relations with Britain, a longtime ally, to a new
low. In announcing his decision, Home Secretary Jack Straw rejected
complaints that a judge who cast the key vote in the 3-2 court
ruling against Pinochet was biased because he heads the
fund-raising arm of the human rights organization Amnesty
International. Pinochet, who has not been seen in public since his
arrest Oct. 16 while recuperating from back surgery at a London
hospital, was scheduled to appear before a London magistrate
Friday. (BRITAIN-PINOCHET, CHILE-PINOCHET)
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi officials blocked U.N. arms monitors
from holding a surprise inspection Wednesday at the Baghdad
headquarters of the ruling Baath Party, a key site in Saddam
Hussein's government. U.N. officials immediately denounced the
move. The inspectors withdrew after an Iraqi official demanded that
they first provide a written declaration of what they were looking
for, the official Iraqi News Agency said. ``This was an absolutely
legal, no-notice inspection and they blocked us,'' Richard Butler,
head of the U.N. Special Commission that oversees inspections, told
The Associated Press in New York. Later Wednesday, however, an
Iraqi official suggested the standoff occurred because of a mistake
by an Iraqi escort in declaring the site sensitive. The incident _
which has the potential to blow up into another U.N.-Iraq crisis _
came two days after Butler announced that he was ordering the
resumption of surprise inspections. On Tuesday, the inspectors
visited 32 sites and on Wednesday, 10 more. (IRAQ-UN, UN-IRAQ)
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Enraged by Israel's refusal to
release security prisoners, Palestinians stoned Israeli troops
Wednesday in the most widespread West Bank clashes in months. A
17-year-old was killed by Israeli gunfire and scores of other
Palestinians were injured. The violence came despite U.S. appeals
for calm and raised new concerns that U.S. President Bill Clinton's
visit to the region next week is triggering unrest, rather than
reassuring Israelis and Palestinians about their troubled peace
accord, as was intended. Thousands of Palestinians fired slingshots
at helmeted Israeli soldiers who responded with tear gas, live
rounds and rubber-coated steel pellets. In scenes reminiscent of
the 1987-93 Palestinian uprising, which began 11 years ago
Wednesday, streets were littered with rocks and overturned garbage
dumpsters, and walls of thick smoke from burning tires rose in the
air. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's former President Suharto
suffered the indignity of being quizzed by state prosecutors
Wednesday over allegations that he corruptly amassed a fortune
during his three decades in power. But with no guarantee that the
77-year-old retired army general will ever face trial, thousands of
students defied security forces and protested in the capital and
three other cities, denouncing the government probe as a sham. Some
threw rocks and clashed with riot police not far from the home of
President B.J. Habibie, Suharto's successor and one-time protege.
It was the third time since his resignation after deadly riots six
months ago that Suharto has been questioned by state lawyers. An
earlier probe said it had found no evidence of wrongdoing, sparking
a wave of protests that prompted Habibie to revive the
investigation. (INDONESIA)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks meandered to a mixed finish Wednesday,
with technology shares driving the Nasdaq market to another record
and the Dow edging lower amid profit worries for Merck, Procter and
Gamble and Coca-Cola. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 18.79
to 9,009.19 after drifting between 59-point loss and a 23-point
gain. It was the second straight day of modest losses for the Dow,
which lost 42 points on Tuesday and now sits about 365 points below
its record of 9,374.27 set Nov. 23. The Nasdaq composite index rose
15.67 to 2,050.42, topping Monday's record close of 2,040.64 and
extending this year's gain to 30.6 percent. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Sweden's Astra and Britain's Zeneca
confirmed Wednesday they will merge in a dlrs 37 billion deal that
will create one of the world's biggest drug manufacturers. Astra is
best known for Prilosec, an ulcer and heartburn medication that is
the world's top selling prescription drug. Zeneca is the second
biggest maker in the world of cancer drugs behind U.S.-based
Bristol-Myers Squibb. The companies expect annual cost savings of
dlrs 1.1 billion from the new company, which will be called
AstraZeneca. However, they expect to incur about dlrs 1.2 billion
in restructuring costs and about 6,000 jobs, or 11 percent of the
combined global workforce, are expected to be lost in the next
three years as a result of the merger. (ZENECA-ASTRA)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The overall U.S. trade deficit surged to dlrs
61.3 billion from July through September, a fourth consecutive
record, as the Asian financial crisis crashed even harder against
America's shores. U.S. exports of everything from soybeans to
computers are down for the year. The Commerce Department reported
Wednesday that the current-account deficit rose 8.1 percent in the
third quarter compared to a deficit of dlrs 56.7 billion in the
spring. The global economic crisis, which has leveled a number of
Asian countries and Russia, has sent American exports plunging,
pushing American farmers into their worst financial crisis in a
decade and triggering thousands of layoffs at manufacturing
companies. U.S. exports of soybeans, corn, autos, chemicals,
computers and lumber have plunged because of the loss of key
overseas markets. (US-ECONOMY)
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the giant U.S. retailer,
will buy 74 stores from the Spar supermarket chain, increasing its
presence in Germany. The deal, announced Wednesday, will make
Wal-Mart a significant force in German retailing at a time when
competition is heating up. Sales have been flat in recent years,
leading to a spate of acquisitions and restructuring by big
retailers. Terms of the deal were not released, but the companies
did say the 74 stores combined have annual sales of about dlrs 1.7
billion. No job cuts were expected. (GERMANY-WAL-MART)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov finally sat down
with his government Wednesday to discuss an austere 1999 budget _
one of the toughest tests of his short tenure, and a task the
Cabinet has repeatedly postponed. Primakov convened his top
ministers behind closed doors to discuss military spending before
it took on the rest of the budget, which is estimated at 575
billion rubles (dlrs 29 billion). The job is not easy: The
government must pay off huge debts to foreign lenders and to
Russian workers, while the country's revenues are shrinking and no
foreign aid has been promised to bail it out. The latest version of
the budget, according to the Interfax news agency, indicates that
the government will cut expenditures drastically and try to
streamline the country's unwieldy tax system. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)

Cube and Martial Solal. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTA ROSA, California (AP) _ A traveling art show featuring
lithographs by John Lennon was accompanied by an early Christmas
gift from Yoko Ono.
	   Ms. Ono had 33,000 pounds (15,000 kilos) of food delivered by
tractor-trailor Tuesday to the Redwood Empire Food Bank.
	   ``It's like the song, `Imagine there's no hunger,''' said
Michael Flood, whose organization distributes food to 120
charities.
	   The art show, which is touring the country, will be on view in
Santa Rosa from Friday through Sunday.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Bryn Terfel, one of opera's hottest stars, will
appear with Patti LuPone, one of Broadway's leading ladies, in
concert performances of ``Sweeney Todd'' with the New York
Philharmonic.
	   Terfel, the hit of the Metropolitan Opera season in Mozart's
``The Marriage of Figaro,'' will sing the Demon Barber of Fleet
Street.
	   Miss LuPone, who won a 1980 Tony for ``Evita,'' will sing Mrs.
Lovett, a baker who uses Todd's victims for her meat pies. It will
be Miss LuPone's New York Philharmonic debut.
	   The pair will sing three performances on May 4-6 in 2000 in
honor of ``Sweeney Todd'' creator Stephen Sondheim.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   REDONDO BEACH, California (AP) _ Police returned dlrs 1.5
million worth of stolen equipment and recordings to Ice Cube and
arrested a man on suspicion of theft.
	   ``I guess one way to gauge Ice Cube's satisfaction with the
Redondo Beach Police Department is to wait and listen to see if his
next rap song is `Thank the Police,''' Sgt. Phil Keenan said
Tuesday.
	   The rapper and the group NWA caused a stir with the 1980s
recording ``F--- tha Police.''
	   Police arrested the man Nov. 2 after watching him break into a
storage facility rented by Ice Cube, whose real name is O'Shea
Jackson.
	   The suspect's name was not released.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ French pianist and composer Martial
Solal won the 10th annual 200,000-kroner (dlrs 31,250) Jazzpar
Prize.
	   Solal ``is continuously expressing himself with versatility, an
inventiveness and a mastery of the piano that is astonishing if not
directly awesome,'' the award committee said. He won the award
Monday.
	   Born in Algiers, Algeria, in 1927, Solal is the first recipient
from a non-English-speaking country of the created in 1989 by the
Danish Jazz Center.
	   Solal ``has the instrument completely under his sway and uses
remarkable technique to carry into effect a synthesis of greater
part of jazz history, adding quite a bit of himself,'' according to
the committee which includes a panel of international jazz critics.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of people at two Indonesian
ports have looted supplies of raw sugar which were being
transported to a processing factory believed to be owned by a
daughter of former President Suharto, a report said Tuesday.
	   The looting began Monday after bags of unprocessed sugar were
loaded onto trucks in two ports in the Serang regency, about 100
kilometers (62 miles) west of Jakarta, the state-run Antara news
agency reported.
	   Outnumbered local policemen were unable to stop crowds, which
included high school students, from jumping onto the trucks and
stealing the bags of sugar, the report said.
	   It quoted some of those participating in the looting as saying
the action was prompted by rumors the supplies were bound for PT.
Bermis, a processing factory they believed to be owned by Suharto's
eldest daughter, Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana.
	   After 32 years of authoritarian rule over the Southeast Asian
country, Suharto quit in May amid civil unrest and political
turmoil.
	   But Indonesia has been rocked by continued unrest since then,
partially as a result of demands that the former president be put
on trial for alleged corruption.

Spacewalking astronauts go back out to install antennas
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 9 grafs to UPDATE with antennas installed, details,
quotes. Picks up 6th graf pvs, `Once activated, ...'; Spacewalk
scheduled to last until 10 or 11 p.m. EST. &QL;

	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ Two astronauts ventured out on
another spacewalk Wednesday and installed antennas on the
international space station under construction nearly 250 miles
above Earth.
	   For the second time this week, Jerry Ross and James Newman
floated out the hatch of the shuttle Endeavour to work on the
seven-story, 35-ton station taking shape in the open cargo bay.
	   Their No. 1 priority was to attach two 100-pound antennas to
Unity, the American-made side of the space station. Their other
job, time permitting, was trickier: trying to open a stuck antenna
on Zarya, the Russian-built control module.
	   The planned seven-hour spacewalk was not nearly as difficult or
crucial as Monday night's outing, during which Ross and Newman
hooked up 40 electrical connections between Zarya and Unity.
	   It was a struggle, though, to get the suitcase-size antennas out
of the narrow tunnel leading into the cargo bay. The spacewalkers
had to back out of the tunnel feet first with the bulky, swinging
antennas in tow.
	   ``Pretty tremendous view when you come out and look at that _
wow,'' Ross said, gazing up at the space station.
	   The astronauts hoisted the antennas halfway up the 36-foot Unity
on the end of the shuttle robot arm. Then they mounted the units on
opposite sides of the cylinder, where just an hour earlier they had
routed a communication cable.
	   The aluminum can gleamed in the sunlight, its ``Unity'' emblem
clearly visible.
	   ``Kind of neat working up here right by the Unity sign, isn't
it?'' Ross called to his partner.
	   Once activated, the antennas will provide a direct, virtually
uninterrupted communication link between Unity and NASA's Mission
Control. Otherwise, U.S. flight controllers would have to rely on
the sporadic coverage provided by Russian ground stations.
	   The electronic and computer hookups for the antennas will be
made inside Unity on Thursday, after the entire crew enters the
orbiting station for the first time.
	   Other spacewalking chores for Ross and Newman on Wednesday
evening included erecting a sunshade over a computer mounted to the
outside of Unity.
	   Mission Control decided just before the spacewalk to let Newman
take a crack at unjamming the Zarya antenna.
	   Flight controllers urged caution. The antenna was rolled up on a
spool, and engineers worried the 3-foot strip might pop open with
enough force to hurt him if he got too close. Newman had a 10-foot
grappling hook for the job.
	   The antenna is one of two that failed to open properly following
Zarya's Nov. 20 launch from Kazakstan.
	   One more spacewalk is planned for Endeavour's 12-day mission: On
Saturday, Ross and Newman will conduct a photo survey and take out
a sack of tools that will be used by future station visitors.
Newman also may try to unjam the other Zarya antenna.
	   This was the sixth spacewalk for Ross during his 18-year
astronaut career, the most by an American, and the third for
Newman.

	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Tears welling in her eyes, the leader of

Communist Party official, disappeared in 1974 after his arrest by
Pinochet's secret police.
	   It is time for Pinochet to ``finally respond before a court for
his crimes,'' Ms. Diaz said.
	   But although Ms. Diaz and the relatives of others who were
killed or disappeared during Pinochet's 17-year rule celebrated
Wednesday's decision, others expressed anger and sorrow.
	   The mixed reaction reflected the deep divisions in Chile about
Pinochet. The former dictator's Oct. 16 arrest in a London
hospital, where he was recovering from back surgery, set off days
of street protests by his supporters and detractors.
	   There were no demonstrations Wednesday after British Home
Secretary Jack Straw's ruling. However, Chile's government
immediately withdrew its ambassador in protest.
	   Interior Minister Raul Troncoso insisted there were no plans to
sever or suspend ties with Britain, and he appealed for calm,
urging Chileans to guard against ``impassioned reactions.''
	   Troncoso called the ruling a violation of Pinochet's immunity as
a Chilean senator and vowed the government would ``use all the
means possible to have this decision reversed.''
	   Chilean President Eduardo Frei, who was in Brazil for a trade
conference, said his country would appeal the decision, but he
called on relatives to be calm and ``not to be overtaken by
passion.''
	   Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza, who was with Frei in
Brazil, said the appeal would be filed by next week at the latest.
But, he said, he did not think the extradition proceedings would
undermine Chile's diplomatic relations with England or Spain.
	   Spain wants Pinochet to face charges of genocide, kidnapping and
torture in the deaths or disappearances of more than 3,000 people
during Pinochet's 1973-90 rule, including dozens of Spaniards.
	   Straw's ruling came the same day that Mario Ramirez was buried
in Santiago _ 25 years after he was executed by Pinochet's military
forces.
	   Ramirez, a 43-year-old university professor and a Socialist
Party member, was executed with 14 others on Oct. 16, 1973, a month
after Pinochet seized power in a bloody coup.
	   The victims' families were given official death certificates,
although the bodies were never handed over to them. The remains
were located and identified only two weeks ago, buried in a mass
grave.
	   Chilean radio and television suspended regular programming to
broadcast Wednesday's decision, and word of the ruling spread
quickly.
	   The Pinochet Foundation, a private organization of retired
military officers and Pinochet supporters, reacted with anger at
the prospect that he could face months or even years of legal
battles.
	   Foundation president Hernan Briones vowed Straw's decision would
be appealed.
	   ``This is not the end of our battle,'' he said, calling the
decision ``yet another expression of Britain's colonialism and
punishment for a small country that is struggling to develop.''
	   Leftist politicians expressed mixed feelings.
	   ``This is good for justice and for human rights, but bad for
Chile and its stability,'' said socialist congressman Patricio
Hales.
	   Sen. Gabriel Valdes, who was persecuted and jailed under
Pinochet, called the decision ``very bad news for Chile because it
violates our sovereignty. It harms our democracy.''
	   Right-wing congressman Victor Perez angrily termed the decision
an escalation of the ``socialist aggression'' against Chile and the
former dictator.
	   ``This decision shows not only the new violation of Chile's
sovereignty but also the total lack of influence of our government.
Britain simply didn't pay any attention to the government's efforts
on behalf of Pinochet,'' he said.
	   The army, which Pinochet commanded for a quarter of a century
until March, called the decision ``an abusive, humiliating measure,
contrary to basic judicial principles.''
	   The civilian defense minister, Jose Florencio Guzman, said he
did not expect any problems, however, within the armed forces.

Netanyahu and Arafat in trouble over Wye River accords
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat have a common problem: They have
been surprised by the depth of opposition among their supporters to
the Wye River accord.
	   Both apparently thought they could overcome the vagueness of the
key points in the agreement, but have failed to do so.
	   Now it will be up to U.S. President Bill Clinton to sell the
peace process all over again, and find a compromise so that further
West Bank withdrawals take place on schedule. He has sent envoy
Dennis Ross to lay the groundwork.
	   ``The gaps right now look very wide,'' Silvan Shalom, the
Israeli minister of science, told The Associated Press.
	   Arafat is facing pressure from the streets _ where riots are a
daily occurrence _ to win the release of political activists from
Israeli jails.
	   The issue has divided the Palestinian Authority, made up in
large part of Palestinians who came from exile abroad, and local
leaders who organized the ``intefadeh,'' the uprising that began
Dec. 9, 1987.
	   ``The Palestinian Authority must reach an agreement with the
popular leaders so that both will go together to struggle against
Israel and not themselves,'' said Abdel Wahab Darawshe, an Arafat
supporter and member of Israel's Knesset, or parliament.
	   To shore up his position, Arafat has dug in his heels on the
prisoner issue, calling those in jail his soldiers and ``heroes.''
	   Just as adamantly, Netanyahu has refused to hand over prisoners
with ``blood on their hands,'' and most of the Palestinians set
free so far were jailed for ordinary crimes.
	   Netanyahu, meanwhile, faces a revolt within his own coalition
and his government narrowly avoided collapse this week.
	   Nine Israeli Cabinet ministers oppose Clinton's visit, fearing
it will give impetus to Palestinian demands for statehood, which
Netanyahu's government opposes. But few are saying so publicly.
	   Israeli hard-liners are also upset because Netanyahu failed to
win a clear commitment that the Palestine National Council, the
600-member parliament in exile, will cancel the charter that calls
for Israel's destruction.
	   ``The PNC vote is very important because it will be the first
time that everyone in the world, including all the Arab nations and
the Palestinian people, will see that they are going to abandon the
dream of a greater Palestine in place of Israel,'' said Shalom, a
longtime Netanyahu ally.
	   Arafat did not get a written Israeli pledge in the Wye accord
that the Palestinians to be freed would be those who belonged to
political factions and not car thieves and burglars. The prisoner
issue is not even mentioned in the memorandum summing up the
agreement.
	   Darawshe said Arafat believed that Netanyahu and Clinton
understood that he meant political prisoners, ones who had been
jailed for being fighters _ not petty thieves.
	   Netanyahu did not get the clear statement his supporters
demanded to reassure Israelis who suspect that Arafat's true
intentions are to resume fighting Israel once he gets what he wants
in the way of land and sovereignty.
	   The agreement said members of the PNC would be invited along
with Palestinian officials from other organizations to reaffirm
support for the peace process and the decisions Palestinian bodies
had taken. There is nothing about a vote to abrogate the charter.
	   Purposeful ambiguity is often a tool used by diplomats to bring
about compromise, but in the case of the Wye accord, the ambiguity
has been unhelpful _ even destructive.
	   Both leaders now must hope Clinton can save it.

Judge orders gymnast's father to stay away for a year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with details from hearing &QL; 
 &UR; By TERRI LANGFORD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ The father of gymnast Dominique Moceanu must stay
away from his daughter for a full year, a judge ruled Wednesday.
	   The 17-year-old Olympian wept and Dumitru Moceanu appeared
visibly stunned as state District Judge John D. Montgomery
restricted any contact between the Romanian native and his gold
medalist daughter to letters or through her lawyer.
	   ``This job comes with a robe and gavel, not a magic wand to make
the pain go away,'' Montgomery said after issuing the permanent
protective order.
	   Montgomery, who declared the athlete a legal adult on Oct. 28,
ruled that Dumitru Moceanu cannot get within 500 feet of his
daughter and cannot threaten or have her followed in any way.
	   The decision followed more than four hours of testimony in a
hearing called by the gymnast and her lawyer.
	   ``I'm sad, but yet, in a way happy,'' Moceanu said, adding that
her life has been turned upside down since her emancipation from
her parents.
	   The Moceanus refused comment. Their lawyer, Katherine Scardino,
described the couple as ``devastated'' at the ruling.
	   ``She (Dominique) wouldn't even speak to them today,'' Scardino
said.
	   Montgomery had previously issued a temporary protective order
prohibiting contact with both parents.
	   Camelia Moceanu, her mother, no longer is restricted by the
court.
	   Dominique Moceanu testified that she and a friend so feared for
their safety that they left Houston for 10 days, including a brief
Caribbean stop, while police investigated alleged threats by her
father.
	   The pair left town after Houston homicide detectives informed
her Nov. 13 that Dumitru Moceanu allegedly wanted to harm Brian
Huggins, who had helped the gymnast hide from her family, and her
coach.
	   Asked Wednesday whether her father was capable of such a thing,
Moceanu said, ``At this point, anything's capable.''
	   Moceanu fled her home earlier this fall and called a lawyer to
begin seeking legal adulthood after friends prodded her to question
what her parents had done with the money she's earned as a star
athlete.
	   With earnings generated by public appearances and competition,
her parents built a 70,000 square-foot gym just north of Houston a
few years ago. The cost was reportedly around dlrs 4 million.
	   After her parents grudgingly allowed Moceanu to claim legal
adulthood, she testified that she saw her father's cars at school.
One day last month, her father pulled her over on a north Houston
road and engaged in a heated exchange that ended with him
regretting having signed the agreement, she said.
	   ``Ever since the emancipation, all we've had is arguments,'' she
said.
	   She learned of the alleged threats from police the next day,
including an investigator's claim that her father wanted Huggins
and coach Luminita Miscenco dead.
	   Soon thereafter, she and Huggins boarded a friend's private jet
and headed to Las Vegas to warn the coach, then flew to the Cayman
Islands, according to testimony.
	   She spent Thanksgiving in Phoenix with the family of Amanda
Borden, a teammate on the Olympic gold medal-winning U.S.
gymnastics team of 1996.
	   Asked about taped conversations dealing with the police
investigation into his alleged threats, Dumitru Moceanu took his
lawyer's advice: ``On the Fifth Amendment, I'm not going to
answer,'' he said, invoking his right not to answer potentially
self-incriminating questions.
	   The Houston Police Department handed over the tapes to
Montgomery, who later said he didn't need them to make his ruling.
	   Huggins and his wife also have obtained a temporary restraining
order against Moceanu.
	   Dumitru Moceanu testified that he met with a private
investigator three times trying to find his daughter's new address,
but added that no money changed hands.
	   ``I talk with investigator just to find the address,'' said
Moceanu, a Romanian immigrant. ``I don't pay him.''
	   Moceanu later testified that her father sent him a bouquet of
flowers as a way of informing her he knew where she lived.
	   Father and daughter were quietly expressive as the other
testified. She often rolled her eyes when he spoke, while he seemed
to be mouthing words when she was on the stand.
	   While nothing in the four hours of daughter-father testimony
during the hearing led Montgomery to believe Miss Moceanu's father
intentionally set out to harm his daughter, he found the Romanian
native's actions qualified as abuse under Texas law.
	   ``I do find family violence ... has occurred,'' the judge
explained. ``And it is likely to occur in the future.
	   The 1996 gold medalist recalled how her father pulled her onto a
scale a year ago, to weigh the athlete. When he noticed she had
gained weight, he began slapping her across the face, she said.
	   A stony-faced Camelia Moceanu, the gymnast's mother, sat
motionless through most of the hearing and was not asked to
testify.

Nike stands by Warne
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Sporting goods company Nike Inc. said
Thursday it will stand by Australian legspinner Shane Warne despite
his involvement in a bookmaker scandal.
	   In a statement, Nike said Warne made a serious misjudgment in
1994 when he and Mark Waugh took money from the illegal Indian
bookmaker to provide information on weather and pitch conditions
during a tour of Sri Lanka.
	   ``In response to recent revelations regarding cricketer Shane
Warne, we will continue our ongoing support of the Australian spin
bowler,'' said the statement.
	   ``We do not, however, condone these actions in any way. We
believe this was a serious misjudgment on Shane's behalf, however
he has been disciplined and subsequently fined by the Australian
Cricket Board for his misconduct.
	   ``Following our discussions with Shane, we understand it is a
decision he regrets, and we believe in the past four years he has
matured and learned from his mistake.''
	   Warne makes more money from endorsements than any other player
in Australian cricket history, earning about 600,000 US dlrs a
year. (djp)

Clash over surprise arms inspections erupts in Baghdad
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi officials blocked U.N. arms monitors
from holding a surprise inspection at the Baghdad headquarters of
the ruling Baath Party, a key site in Saddam Hussein's government.
U.N. officials immediately denounced the move.
	   The inspectors withdrew Wednesday after an Iraqi official
demanded that they first provide a written declaration of what they
were looking for, the official Iraqi News Agency said.
	   ``This was an absolutely legal, no-notice inspection and they
blocked us,'' Richard Butler, head of the U.N. Special Commission
that oversees inspections, told The Associated Press in New York.
	   Later Wednesday, however, an Iraqi official suggested the
standoff occurred because of a mistake by an Iraqi escort in
declaring the site sensitive.
	   The incident _ which has the potential to blow up into another
crisis _ came two days after Butler announced that he was ordering
the resumption of surprise inspections. On Tuesday, the inspectors
visited 32 sites and on Wednesday, 10 more.
	   Butler said the Iraqi demand for a written notice was ``simply
wrong'' and ``nonsense.''
	   Despite the Iraqi interference, Butler plans to continue the
searches, which are expected to conclude by early next week, said
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, speaking at a NATO
meeting in Brussels, Belgium, said Iraq had no choice but to work
with the inspectors as it has pledged to do.
	   ``There will be no comprehensive review (of sanctions against
Iraq) until it is evident that Iraq is cooperating with UNSCOM,''
she said, using the acronym for the weapons team.
	   Unannounced visits in the past have been a major source of
friction with Iraq, leading to three crises in the past year.
	   Iraq had suspended the inspections in August. It allowed them to
resume only last month, averting a military strike by the United
States and Britain. The two countries have left an armada in the
Gulf to ensure that Iraq abides by its promise to cooperate.
	   Still, Wednesday's dispute elicited a cautious reaction from the
United States.
	   David Leavy, spokesman for the National Security Council, said
Iraq's rebuff to inspectors did not bring the United States closer
to armed conflict with Iraq. He stressed that President Bill
Clinton's administration wants to hear Butler's report to the
Security Council on an overall assessment of Iraq's compliance _
not just on inspections but also in turning over documents.
	   UNSCOM must certify that Iraq has eliminated its chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons as well as long-range missiles
before U.N. economic sanctions can be lifted. The sanctions were
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Iraqi officials have
long insisted they have eliminated all illegal weapons.
	   In New York, Iraq's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Saeed Hasan said the
building in dispute was the headquarters of the Baghdad branch of
the Baath Party.
	   Oil Minister Amer Mohammed Rashid said the U.N. team arrived
Wednesday morning at the site, which their Iraqi escort declared as
``sensitive.''
	   The escort allowed four inspectors to enter briefly, Rashid
said. They came out and requested 12 inspectors be allowed to
enter. ``This was refused by the Iraqi (escort),'' he said.
	   Rashid added that the escort was wrong in declaring the site
sensitive, which he said would include installations of the elite
Republican Guard and security services.
	   The minister told a news conference, however, that the
inspectors are deliberately seeking a confrontation.
	   He said Iraq did agree in a Feb. 23 agreement with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to allow surprise inspections. But, he
said, the United Nations also agreed ``to respect the security,
integrity and legitimate concerns of the Iraqi government,'' which
Rashid said included prior notice in visiting sites the government
considered sensitive.
	   U.N. inspectors have insisted that their searches should not be
restricted by Iraq in any way.
	   ``The practices of the inspectors ... have the clear goal of
creating crises and problems,'' the Iraqi News Agency quoted Gen.
Hossam Mohammed Amin as saying. Amin heads an office that works
with UNSCOM.
	   As many as 140 inspectors were working in Iraq on Wednesday, as
well as some visiting experts, said Caroline Cross, a U.N.
spokeswoman in Baghdad. She would not give the exact number
involved but said it was ``a little less than 200.''
	   A team from the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is
responsible for inspecting Iraq's nuclear programs, also arrived in
Baghdad on Wednesday and met with Iraqi officials, said Amin.

IOC member: Salt Lake Olympic payments weren't legitimate
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CARTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ A controversy over scholarships given to
relatives of International Olympic Committee members will be
pressed by a prominent member of the IOC's executive committee, who
on Wednesday said the payments were inappropriate.
	   Marc Hodler of Switzerland, who heads the IOC's commission
overseeing Salt Lake's Winter Games preparation, told National
Public Radio's Howard Berkes that the payments were ``not
legitimate'' and that he'll pursue the issue at the IOC's quarterly
executive committee meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, this weekend.
	   ``Olympic organizers are not allowed to pay for that,'' Berkes
quoted Hodler as saying. ``Salt Lake City paid because they lost
twice and wanted to win.
	   ``I think it helped get votes,'' he said.
	   Berkes related Hodler's comments on NPR's ``All Things
Considered'' newscast Wednesday. Hodler, Berkes said, declined to
be taped.
	   Salt Lake Organization officials have denied the bid committee's
dlrs 500,000 ``humanitarian aid'' project was a veiled effort to
buy key IOC members' support in the four years between votes on the
1998 and 2002 Winter Games. Salt Lake lost to Nagano, Japan in
1991, when the program was begun. It won a landslide vote to host
the 2002 Games in the 1995 IOC vote in Budapest, Hungary.
	   In the interim, the bid committee _ under the direction of
former president Thomas Welch _ spent nearly dlrs 400,000 on
scholarships to 13 individuals _ six of them relatives of IOC
members, mostly from Africa.
	   Among those was Sonia Essomba, the daughter of the late Rene
Essomba of Camaroon. The elder Essomba, a prominent surgeon, was
the secretary general of the National Olympic Committees of Africa,
a position which would have given him considerable influence over
the roughly 20 other IOC members on that continent.
	   SLOC president Frank Joklik, in outlining an audit of the
program for reporters on Tuesday, refused to identify the other
recipients.
	   In an interview last week, Welch said no other IOC members were
involved in the scholarship program. A telephone message left at
his Park City, Utah, condominium was not returned Wednesday.
	   Meantime, the United States Olympic Committee is distancing
itself from the controversy. Over the weekend, USOC spokesman Mike
Moran characterized the fund as ``nurturing the Olympic family.''
	   On Wednesday, Moran said USOC will expect a full accounting of
SLOC's program. Moreover, Moran insisted the IOC must do more to
ensure its members are above reproach.
	   ``The IOC must wipe out even the appearance that its voting
members can be influenced,'' he said.
	   ``The IOC shares equal responsible in making sure that the
opportunities to create this kind of appearance do not exist any
longer,'' Moran said. ``The IOC has tried to make it clear ...
(that) gifts and excesses are no longer permitted.
	   Even the appearance of some misdeed ``damages the Olympic
movement,'' Moran said. ``I suspect the IOC will have to reinforce
that message.''
	   Hodler, too, placed much of the blame on the IOC recipients of
such largess. He told NPR one solution would be to take the process
for selecting host cities away from the general membership of the
IOC and place it with the 11-member executive committee, with the
help of selected experts. Another would be to expel IOC members who
accept such gifts.
	   Hodler is a Swiss lawyer and IOC member since 1963. Salt Lake
beat out Sion, Switzerland, for the 2002 Games in the 1995 vote.
	   Fallout from the SLOC revelations continued to fall in Utah,
where some SLOC board members criticized not only the bid committee
which dissolved when Salt Lake won the bid _ but also the
organizing committee for not being even more forthcoming.
	   SLOC officials complained the focus on what the bid committee
did six years ago is distracting and damaging to their efforts to
stage the Games three years hence.
	   ``This isn't good. It's not helpful,'' said Shelley Thomas,
SLOC's vice president in charge of communications. ``We can't be
looking backward.''

Dollar lower against yen, Japanese stocks mixed in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was lower against the yen early
Thursday after Japan's finance minister reportedly criticized U.S.
foreign exchange policy. Japanese stocks turned mixed.
	   The dollar bought 118.10 yen in early trading, down 0.68 yen
from late Wednesday in Tokyo but above its late New York rate of
117.82 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 4.02 points,
or 0.03 percent, to 14,927.88 in the first 30 minutes of trading.
On Wednesday, the average closed up 123.70 points, or 0.84 percent.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar's move followed reported
comments by Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa during a parliamentary
session Wednesday.
	   Kyodo News agency quoted Miyazawa as saying the United States
``desires a strong dollar when U.S. industry is robust and wishes
for the reverse when it is weak.''
	   Miyazawa said he sees nothing ``consistent'' in U.S. currency
policy, Kyodo said. He suggested that the United States feels
comfortable seeing the dollar at around 110 yen or 120 yen, the
report said.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the market's main index opened
lower on profit-taking following rises the past three days.
	   ``We've had a good rally,'' said Louis Tseng, the head of
derivatives at Jardine Fleming Securities.
	   Overseas on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average closed
at 9,009.19 points Wednesday, down 18.79.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up a marginal 1.18 points, or 0.10 percent, to
1,141.92. The TOPIX closed up 8.75 points, or 0.77 percent, the day
before.
	   Market players said investors remain somewhat cautious ahead of
the special quotation for the settlement of futures and options
contracts Friday, and the release of the Japanese central bank's
quarterly survey of business sentiment, or tankan, on Monday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.170 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.110
percent, driving its price down to 105.38 yen from 105.92 yen.

Doctor develops gentler surgery to correct sunken chest

<TEXT>
	   NORFOLK, Virginia (AP) _ Carden McKinley used to have a
depression in the middle of his chest so deep that a bar of soap
fit in it.
	   The 10-year-old boy suffered from a congenital condition called
pectus excavatum, or sunken or funnel chest, that occurs in about
one child in 1,000.
	   Pectus can cause chest pain and breathing problems because the
sternum turns inward, crowding the heart and reducing lung
capacity. In Carden's case, he had asthma attacks.
	   Although surgery is needed only in more severe cases, the
operation that has been available since 1910 to correct pectus is
brutal.
	   A doctor slices open the child's chest, removes the ribs, cuts
out a piece of the breastbone, elevates the breastbone and replaces
the ribs. In the 1950s, doctors also began inserting a steel bar to
support the breastbone.
	   Dr. Donald Nuss, a pediatric surgeon, decided there had to be an
easier way.
	   ``We all know that children have a soft chest,'' Nuss said. ``If
the chest is that soft, why do we need to cut out all the bones?''
	   Nuss devised a technique that involves cutting two small holes
on either side of the child's chest and pulling through a stainless
steel bar beneath the breastbone and ribs.
	   The curved bar ``pops'' out the depression. It is not visible
from the outside and stays in place for about two years. The bar is
removed as an outpatient procedure.
	   Nuss and his associates at Children's Hospital of the King's
Daughters have performed the surgery about 120 times since 1987.
	   His patients have included Carden, who had his surgery a year
ago. Carden's two older brothers also had pectus and underwent
Nuss' procedure in the spring.
	   ``I never would have done the other surgery. There was no way,''
said their mother, Lona McKinley, 40. The older technique seemed
too grisly, she said, and would have left their chests rigid,
making it unsafe for the boys to play sports.
	   After amassing 10 years of data that he believes proves the
long-term success of his technique, Nuss began telling other
doctors about the surgery.
	   In May 1997, he presented his work at an American Pediatric
Surgery Association meeting. His paper was published in April this
year in APSA's peer-reviewed Journal of Pediatric Surgery, and the
procedure was featured in a recent presentation at the Clinical
Congress of the American College of Surgeons, held in Orlando,
Florida.
	   At least 50 surgeons from the Mayo Clinic, Duke University
Medical Center, Medical College of Virginia and other institutions
have come to Norfolk to learn from Nuss how to perform the surgery.
And children have come to CHKD from across the mid-Atlantic states
and as far away as Maine, Florida and Kansas for the procedure.
	   Nuss' procedure has several advantages over the old technique,
said Dr. Deborah Billmire, a pediatric surgeon at St. Christopher's
Hospital for Children in Philadelphia who has observed Nuss perform
the surgery and has performed the technique herself.
	   ``It has superior cosmetic results, it has shortened healing
time and it takes quite a bit less time to do,'' she said.
	   The older surgery took three to six hours and some children lost
so much blood they needed transfusions. Recuperation took three to
six months and the patient was left with a large scar. In addition,
sometimes the ribs didn't grow back properly, causing breathing
problems.
	   Nuss' procedures take 45 minutes and leaves two small scars
under the armpits. Complications are minimal, Nuss said.
	   The child spends four to five days in the hospital and, after
discharge, can slowly resume normal activity. Most children return
to school after two weeks with restrictions such as no heavy
lifting.
	   After a month, the patient may return to regular activity _
including sports. Carden pitched on his school's baseball team in
the spring. His 11-year-old brother Philip is playing ball this
fall, and his 14-year-old brother Harrison has resumed playing
golf.
	   ``They're 110 percent,'' their mother said, also noting that
Carden hasn't had an asthma attack since the surgery.
	   The operation is easier and the recovery time is faster in
children 12 and younger because their bones and cartilage are more
flexible. However, Nuss has performed the surgery on patients as
old as 20.

Traditional parties regroup after devastating presidential loss in

Venezuela &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Venezuela's two major traditional
parties tried to regroup Wednesday after their devastating loss in
the nation's presidential race.
	   Former coup leader Hugo Chavez was elected president Sunday with
nearly 57 percent of the vote _ the first person from outside the
traditional party elite to win the presidency in 40 years of
democracy.
	   On Wednesday, rank-and-file members of one old-style party, the
center-right COPEI, called for the removal of the top leadership,
including former president Luis Herrera Campins. That could happen
at COPEI's general assembly in January.
	   One COPEI leader, Congressman Ramon Guillermo Aveledo, the
former president of the lower house, resigned from COPEI's national
directorate on Tuesday.
	   ``We must open the party to new and fresh generations,'' COPEI
secretary general Donald Ramirez said Wednesday.
	   Venezuela's other traditional party, the center-left Democratic
Action, also met Wednesday to discuss how to recover lost political
ground, but no decision was announced regarding the party
leadership.
	   In addition to winning the presidency, Chavez's Patriotic Pole
coalition won a plurality of Congress in Nov. 8 regional elections,
overnight becoming Venezuela's largest political force.

Unique cameras discover Asian tigers disappearing faster than

<TEXT>
	   TA PHAYA NATIONAL PARK, Thailand (AP) _ A network of
motion-sensitive cameras is revealing what conservationists have
long feared: one of Asia's most magnificent beasts, the tiger, is
even closer to extinction than previously thought.
	   Conservationists have long warned that hunting and loss of
habitat threaten the region's tigers with extinction. Now, the New
York-based Wildlife Conservation Society is conducting a survey to
determine the extent of the danger.
	   To the dismay of the scientists, the initial results indicate a
steeper than expected decline in the population of Southeast Asia's
biggest cat.
	   Leading the project in Thailand is Tony Lynam, 33, a zoologist
from Perth, Australia. For two years, he has combed the jungles,
searching for tiger tracks and gathering anecdotal evidence from
villagers.
	   The core of his research, though, is about 30 unmanned cameras
placed in waterproof boxes and strapped to trees close to the
ground along paths tigers are suspected of using.
	   Each camera sends out an infrared beam. Every time something
breaks the beam, the camera clicks. The technique, first used in
India, gives a rapid, comprehensive analysis of a forest's wildlife
and habitat.
	   Lynam and his Thai assistants space the cameras to cover 40
square kilometers (16 square miles) of forest. After a month to six
weeks, they return, collect the cameras and develop the film.
	   ``That's the really exciting part,'' Lynam says. ``You simply
don't know what you've got. It could be tigers, or it could just be
10 porcupines.''
	   The photos are breathtaking: candid shots of tigers on the
prowl, a split second before the shock of the camera flash
intrudes.
	   In one picture, a flesh wound in a tiger's flank is visible. In
another, the tiger is so close to the lens that the frame is filled
with its coat and distinctive stripes.
	   But the bad news is that although Lynam has 40 pictures of
tigers, they represent just six individual animals _ from four
major Thai national parks.
	   ``The alarm bells are ringing bloody loud,'' Lynam says. ``There
are fewer tigers than we'd ever thought out in those forests. What
it means is that tigers really are on their way out.''
	   No one knows how many tigers are left in the wild in Southeast
Asia. The entire Asian continent is thought to have only 5,000,
half of them in India. Some experts estimate that one tiger dies a
day.
	   Thailand is at the center of the tiger's global habitat.
Ideally, the animals should be most numerous in the center, but a
comparison with India underlines the reality.
	   In one Thai reserve of 200 square kilometres (80 square miles),
Lynam's team found a single tiger. There are 60 in an Indian
reserve of 640 square kilometres (246 square miles).
	   The Thai Royal Forestry Department is cooperating fully with the
project. Staff are being trained to carry on the work after Lynam's
team moves on.
	   ``The tiger is an indicator of the forest,'' says Viroj
Pimmanrojnagool, the department's director of wildlife research.
``If we have tigers, it means our forests are still rich with
biodiversity.''
	   The main reasons for the tiger's decline are loss of habitat to
human encroachment and poaching to provide tiger organs for Asian
traditional medicines.
	   Experts say that a forest of less than 135 square kilometres (54
square miles) cannot support tigers. As expanding settlements and
roads require more trees to be cut down, tigers are being squeezed
out of existence.
	   Although it's banned, hunting in Thailand's national parks is
common. For every shot Lynam's cameras take of a tiger, bear, deer
or elephant, there is another of a man, or group of men, walking
through the forest, guns in hand. Some pictures record hunters
going into the jungle in the morning empty-handed and returning in
the evening with bulging sacks.
	   Ta Phaya National Park is part of a forest complex that
stretches from central Thailand eastward to the Cambodian border.
It should be prime tiger territory, but it isn't.
	   During a recent trek to collect cameras, Lynam and his team
found snare after snare, including one rigged to fire a
rocket-propelled grenade. Thai army rangers assigned to protect
Lynam's team say banditry and hunting are major problems.
	   When research is completed in the next three to five years, the
World Conservation Society will make suggestions to the Thai and
other Southeast Asian governments on how to conserve tigers.
	   Lynam says the forests need to be protected, conservation areas
set aside, and anti-hunting laws enforced.
	   ``The tigers are still there _ look!'' Lynam says, jabbing at
his photos. ``The situation's critical, but it's not too late.''

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Archie Moore, the light heavyweight champion
who set the record for knockouts during his 27-year career and the
only boxer to fight Marciano and Ali, died Wednesday at 84.
	   Moore had undergone heart surgery a few years ago and his health
had deteriorated in the past two weeks, his son, Billy, said. Moore
was taken to a San Diego hospice last week and several of his eight
children had kept vigil at his bedside.
	   ``My dad lived a good life and we're not sad,'' Billy Moore
said. ``We know he's gone home to be with the Lord and we rejoice
in that.''
	   Moore retired at 49 in 1963 after a career considered one of the
most amazing examples of longevity in sports.
	   He held the light heavyweight title for 11 of the 27 years he
was in the ring, knocking out 141 opponents in 228 bouts, according
to the Boxing Record Book. Other sources list his knockout total at
145, while others say it was 129.
	   Moore, whose trademark was a ready smile and knee-length boxing
trunks, traveled the world as an ambassador for the sport and spent
much of his retirement telling young boys to stay away from drugs.
President Eisenhower once sought his expertise on the issue.
	   Moore, whose real name was Archibald Lee Wright, was born in
Benoit, Mississippi on Dec. 13, 1913. He won his first professional
fight 23 years later, with a decision over Murray Allen in Quincy,
Illinois.
	   He won the light heavyweight title in 1952 at age 39 with a
victory over Joey Maxim. He successfully defended it nine times,
but along the way lost to heavyweight champions Rocky Marciano,
Floyd Patterson and Muhammad Ali. He was the only boxer who fought
Marciano and Ali.
	   Moore had some of his greatest battles with Harold Johnson, who
held a portion of the crown. They fought five times from 1949 to
1954 with Moore the winner all but once.
	   They met only once with the title at stake. Moore won that bout
in New York on Aug. 11, 1954, retaining his crown with a 14th-round
knockout. He also defended the title against Bobo Olson, Yolande
Pompey, Tony Anthony, Guilio Rinaldi and twice against Maxim and
Yvon Durelle.
	   Fighting in an era where fixed bouts were not uncommon, Moore
said he never took a dive. In a 1989 interview with Sports
Illustrated, Moore recalled valuable advice he received from an
aunt.
	   ``'Archie, take your rest, mind your trainer and bring no
disgrace to your family, like throwing fights,''' he quoted her as
saying.
	   Moore fought Marciano on Sept. 21, 1955, losing on a ninth-round
knockout. Nevertheless, it did nothing to diminish his image as one
of the most courageous boxers ever.
	   Fighting an undefeated heavyweight king 10 years his junior,
Moore _ also known as the Mongoose _ floored Marciano in the second
round. Marciano eventually wore Moore down, to the point where the
referee wanted to stop the fight after eight rounds.
	   ``Oh, no,'' an exhausted Moore protested. ``I want to be counted
out. I'm a champion, too.''
	   But Moore's bloodiest fight was not his loss to Marciano, or his
wars with Johnson and Maxim. It came in 1958, in the first of his
title defenses against the Canadian Durelle.
	   Moore, who was to win on an 11th-round knockout, was floored
four times.
	   ``The first time he put me down ... I thought `Wow, this guy can
hit,''' Moore recalled. ``They said Marciano was a house wrecker,
and he was, but it took him a volley to get the job done. This guy
_ one punch.''
	   Moore was elected to the Boxing Hall of Fame in 1966, three
years after his final bout, a three-round knockout of Mike DiBiase,
and five years after he was stripped of his title by the National
Boxing Association because of politics.
	   The champion had a soft spot for youth, having spent 22 months
in a reformatory. Eisenhower invited Moore to the White House to
join a group fighting juvenile delinquency.
	   Eisenhower aides quoted the president as saying Moore should be
a congressman. ``Are you a Republican or a Democrat?'' he said.
	   ``Neither,'' Moore said with a laugh. ``I'm a diplomat.''
	   Moore's survivors include his wife, Joan, and his eight
children.

Church says aid still needed for Nicaraguan hurricane victims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RODOLFO GARCIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   POSOLTEGA, Nicaragua (AP) _ With Christmas just two weeks away,
a Roman Catholic Church spokesman has put out the call for greater
aid for the thousands of Nicaraguans who lost their homes to
Hurricane Mitch.
	   ``Posoltega, the eye of the disaster, has received little food
assistance,'' said Carlos Ivan Vergara, spokesman for the Rev.
Benjamin Villarreal, who is coordinating aid efforts.
	   He called Wednesday for international help, especially shipments
of medicine and clothing, and ``with Christmas coming, toys for the
thousands of children who were affected.''
	   Vergara said the Nicaraguan government has sent very little
relief to Posoltega, forcing victims to rely on contributions from
religious and charity groups.
	   ``We still do not understand why the government has not sent
sufficient aid to these people,'' he said.
	   The area near Posoltega, 70 miles (115 kms) northwest of
Managua, suffered the worst damage in Nicaragua during the Oct.
25-Nov. 2 storm.
	   Heavy rain caused a crater lake atop the Casitas Volcano to
burst its banks on Oct. 30, spilling tons of mud, water and trees
onto several villages. An estimated 2,000 people were killed, and
another 3,500 lost their homes.
	   Vergara said the Rev. Villarreal, who was out of town Wednesday,
also hopes to build a chapel and cemetery for the disaster victims,
which could be used by survivors to remember them.

O'Meara and Duval join forces again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Mark O'Meara and David Duval, the
best two players in America this year, will get a chance to keep
their Presidents Cup record perfect.
	   O'Meara, the PGA Tour player of the year after winning the
Masters and British Open, will be paired again with Duval, the
leading money winner, in the first of five alternate-shot matches
against the International team at Royal Melbourne Golf Club.
	   O'Meara and Duval, 3-0 in the 1996 matches, will go up against
Peter Thomson's two captains picks _ Greg Turner and Frank Nobilo
of New Zealand.
	   ``They said they would like to get out first, and I honored
their wish for that,'' said U.S. captain Jack Nicklaus.
	   Thomson also decided to put his top two Australians together _
Greg Norman and Steve Elkington _ in the second match against John
Huston and Jim Furyk. Norman and Elkington have never been paired
together in the Presidents Cup, but won the Shark Shootout together
last month in Norman's return to golf after shoulder surgery.
	   ``They wanted to play together if it was possible,'' Thomson
said. ``So I
	   made it possible.''
	   Tiger Woods, who went 1-2 while paired with O'Meara in the Ryder
Cup last year, will be paired with Fred Couples in the marquee
match _ they'll go up against two-time U.S. Open champion Ernie Els
and reigning U.S. PGA champion Vijay Singh.
	   Five alternate shot matches will be played Friday morning
followed by five best-ball matches in the afternoon.
	   ``I don't think there were any surprises,'' Nicklaus said.
``It's pretty difficult to get a surprise pairing when you have 24
of the world's best players.''
	   Unlike the Ryder Cup, every player must be in at least one match
on the first day. Nicklaus decided to sit out Phil Mickelson and
Mark Calcavecchia for the first batch of alternate-shot matches,
while Joe Ozaki of Japan and Carlos Franco of Paraguay will sit for
the International team.
	   Calcavecchia, on his first national team since the 1991 Ryder
Cup, is 0-4
	   in alternate-shot matches and 4-0 in the best-ball matches.
Mickelson is 1-3-1 in his alternate-shot matches in either the
Presidents or Ryder Cup.
	   That's not to say Nicklaus spent the night tossing and turning
about who will be paired together, or poring over spread sheets of
his squad's record in match play. He has said he would leave the
pairings largely up to the pairings, and that's exactly how it
turned out.
	   ``I think they were more responsible for making the teams on the
first day than I was,'' Nicklaus said. ``I wanted the guys to be
comfortable with who they are playing, happy with what they are
doing.''
	   Couples and Love have a history of playing together in cup
matches, but Nicklaus said Couples and Woods wanted to play
together. Love and Justin Leonard, who played in the World Cup of
Golf last year, are in the final pairing against Stuart Appleby and
Nick Price.
	   The other American pairing is Scott Hoch and Lee Janzen, the
last-minute substitute for Hal Sutton. Janzen and Hoch both live in
Orlando, Florida, and won an alternate-shot match together in the
Ryder Cup. They will play Shigeki Maruyama and Craig Parry.
	   In another variation from the Ryder Cup, instead of each captain
submitting his pairings and the order in which they will play, a
coin flip decided which captain filled in the first tee time, and
they took turns for all five matches.
	   Nicklaus won the coin toss and deferred.
	   ``I call heads-tails,'' he said. (df/djp)

Exploring the stratosphere on a gossamer wing

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Nineteen miles (30 kilometers) above the
Earth _ on a wing and a solar glare.
	   That's the goal of engineers conducting test flights of a
remotely piloted 206-foot (62.7-meter) flying wing they hope will
someday make a slow ascent into the cold, thin air of the
stratosphere using only sunlight.
	   Scientists want aircraft like the Centurion for atmospheric
research. Meteorologists may be able to use them for tracking major
storms. There's also interest in versions that could stay aloft for
weeks performing the same functions as satellites at a far cheaper
cost.
	   ``To fly in level flight at 100,000 feet (30,480 meters) will be
higher than any nonrocket-powered airplane has flown,'' said Ray
Morgan, vice president of AeroVironment Inc., which is developing
Centurion under NASA's Environmental Research Aircraft and Sensor
Technology program.
	   With 14 propellers and a wingspan bigger than a Boeing 747,
Centurion is a leap in size over predecessors. Yet it weighs just
1,175 pounds and cruises at about 20 mph (32 kph).
	   Eventually, the electrical power will come from panels of solar
cells atop the wing. For now, it's running on conventional
batteries during low-level test flights above a dry lakebed at
Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert.
	   Bad weather has interfered with flight plans so far this month,
but two tests in November went so well that the series of
developmental flights may be cut short. Morgan said there is
discussion of extending the wingspan another 45 to 100 feet (14 to
30 meters).
	   The wing is so stable that it could be cut into a half-dozen
sections and each would fly. In flight, the wing's flexibility
sometimes makes it look like an ocean swell, with a wave running
down to one tip and then running back.
	   ``It works like many aircraft flying in close formation, but
they do happen to be structurally interconnected,'' Morgan said.
	   Extensive automation of the control system is essential, not
just because Centurion is unmanned, but because the potential for
problems increases with the length of the span, Morgan said.
	   For example, because the wing is so long and its speed is so
slow, a turn could cause ``tip stall,'' when the wingtip on the
inside of the turn stops moving forward and essentially stops
flying.
	   AeroVironment of Monrovia, California, was founded by Paul
MacCready, a pioneer in super-light aircraft who gained fame for
designs used in human-powered flights.
	   Centurion follows that tradition. Construction materials include
carbon fiber, Kevlar, Styrofoam and plastic film. The step up to
Centurion follows tests of smaller solar-powered planes: Solar
Challenger, Pathfinder and Pathfinder Plus.
	   Pathfinder Plus, with a wingspan of 121 feet (36.8 meters) and
eight motors, reached an altitude of 80,285 feet (24,470 meters) in
August during testing over the Pacific near Hawaii. The altitude
was a record for a propeller-driven aircraft.
	   NASA's ERAST program is developing a variety of unpiloted
aircraft suitable for research at various altitudes and capable of
adaptation to commercial uses.
	   Scientists' interest in high-flying, solar-powered aircraft is
based on the need for atmospheric sampling without altering the
very air that is being collected.
	   Rockets can easily reach 100,000 feet (30,480 meters), and the
X-15 rocket plane flew three times that high. But such speed
affects atmospheric samples.
	   ``Once you start going supersonic it's no longer of great value,
the reason being that the heating associated with the compression
of the air as it moves through it changes the chemistry,'' Morgan
said.
	   Balloons are also used in high-altitude research but they tend
to ``off-gas,'' making it difficult for sensors to get unbiased
readings, he said. Balloons also have problems with altitude and
location control.
	   Morgan said developing the series of solar-powered planes has
cost about dlrs 30 million and it will take more to finish
Centurion. Only one high-efficiency solar panel, costing about dlrs
1.5 million, has been acquired. The program will need about dlrs 7
million more to acquire four more panels.
	   From a technical standpoint Centurion could be ready to attempt
100,000 feet (30,480 meters) as early as the year 2000, he said,
but it will probably be later.
	   Centurion is to be followed by Helios, designed to be able to
stay aloft for great lengths of time, using solar power during
daytime and solar-charged batteries at night.

Court finds Nomura manipulated Australian stock market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The Federal Court found Thursday that
investment house Nomura International Plc. manipulated the
Australian stock market by creating a ``false and misleading
appearance'' of active trading in a series of trades in March 1996.
	   On the day in question, the Japanese investment giant offloaded
587 million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 364 million) worth of
securities, selling in large parcels in the last few minutes of
trading and allowing some 12,900 futures contracts to expire.
	   Justice Ronald Sackville upheld allegations by the Australian
Securities and Investments Commission that Nomura knew its actions
would cause a fall in both the benchmark All Ordinaries Index, the
nation's basic stock market indicator, and the March share price
index (SPI).
	   Sackville said Nomura's actions on March 29, 1996, had
contravened both the Corporations Law and the Trade Practices Act.
	   He said the series of transactions made by Nomura, including the
creation of a bid basket for all securities in the benchmark all
ordinaries index at 5 to 20 percent below the previous day's
trading price, gave a false and misleading appearance of active
trading on the ASX in illiquid securities.
	   ``It also engaged in conduct intended to create a false or
misleading appearance with respect to the price of the illiquid
securities held by it on the same day,'' he said.
	   Sackville said Nomura knew that its actions would cause a fall
in the closing level of the all ords and the expiry price of SPI
contracts.
	   He also found that Nomura's creation of the bid basket was part
of its plan to lower the price of illiquid stocks at the close of
trading by engaging in ``self-trades at depressed prices.''
	   Nomura had traded with itself in respect to two securities and
was only saved from carrying out more such transactions by the
failure of various brokerages to fully carry out orders, he said.
	   The March sale orders were instructions given by Nomura to 10
separate brokers, requiring them to sell Nomura's basket of
securities very aggressively near the close of trading.
	   Sackville adjourned the matter to Dec. 18 when parties can make
submissions on any final orders.
	   Nomura International Plc., based in Sydney, is the wholly owned
Australian subsidiary of Nomura Securities Co., said Atsuko Toda, a
spokeswoman at Nomura headquarters in Tokyo.
	   Toda said the Tokyo office had yet to receive the contents of
the Federal Court's judgment and that local Nomura officials in
Australia were still examining the court papers.
	   ``We are not in a situation to comment right now,'' she said.

	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ A week after the first death squad was
sentenced for killings during Guatemala's 36-year civil war,
President Alvaro Arzu called Wednesday for a national ``day of
forgiveness'' on Dec. 29.
	   The holiday would coincide with the second anniversary of the
peace accords that ended the war.
	   Arzu said he will ``ask, in the name of the government, for
forgiveness for the excesses which may have occurred ... and in
particular, for the damage to all the people.''
	   Neither Arzu nor his National Advance Party held power during
the war, in which 150,000 people, most of them civilians, were
killed.
	   ``The wounds from the armed conflict have not yet healed,'' he
said. ``The pain persists. ... We did a lot of damage to one
another.''
	   A report by a Catholic Church human rights office this year
blamed the army for nearly 80 percent of the killings. Guatemala
did not declare any amnesty or pardon for military or paramilitary
forces for war crimes.
	   On Nov. 30, three former members of a pro-government ``defense
patrol'' were sentenced to death for their roles in a 1982 massacre
of Indian villagers, the first such convictions for killings in the
civil war.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Former Miss Universe Irene Saez
returned to her job as a local mayor Wednesday after losing
Venezuela's presidential race.
	   Saez, 36, finished a distant third in Sunday's election, which
former coup leader Hugo Chavez won in a landslide. Saez, who had
taken a leave as mayor of the affluent Chacao municipality in
Caracas, said she would finish out her three-year term, which ends
in June.
	   ``I will keep fighting for Venezuela and I will keep fighting
for my people,'' she told reporters.
	   The social Christian COPEI, one of Venezuela's two major
traditional parties, dumped Saez as its candidate in a last-ditch
effort to derail Chavez. The party threw its support to former
state gov. Henrique Salas Romer, who finished second.
	   Saez stayed in the race as an independent.

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ A federal judge on Wednesday
ordered a retired naval admiral from Argentina's ``dirty war''
years to be detained on charges of child kidnapping.
	   Ret. Adm. Jose Supicich is the fourth former military official
arrested this year as part of Argentine investigations into charges
the armed forces' illegally adopted children born to slain
dissidents.
	   The charges of child kidnapping are not covered under a 1990
presidential pardon extended to the military's top officers of the
1976-83 dictatorship.
	   According to a government report, nearly 9,000 Argentines,
disappeared during the military regime's war on leftists and
dissidents. Human rights, however, insist the figure is closer to
30,000.
	    &UR; ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ As Bolivia's president prepares for an
official visit, the leftist party that governs Mexico City has
declared him persona non grata, and the mayor is refusing to give
him the keys to the city.
	   The Democratic Revolution Party, known as the PRD, said
Wednesday that President Hugo Banzer, who led a military coup in
1971, should be tried for human rights abuses like former Chilean
dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who is under arrest in England on a
Spanish arrest warrant.
	   ``It is an affront that (Banzer) set foot on Mexican soil and
for the Mexican government to welcome him in an official visit,''
the PRD said in a statement.
	   In La Paz, the Bolivian capital, presidential aide Carlos
Iturralde said the PRD's position does not reflect that of the
Mexican government, and insisted the bilateral relationship between
Mexico and Bolivia ``is at its all-time best.''
	   Banzer's official state visit to Mexico City was scheduled to
begin Thursday. He planned to meet with President Ernesto Zedillo.
	   Mexico City Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the PRD's founder, said
he will not meet with Banzer or give him the keys to the city, as
is customary when foreign heads of state visit Mexico. It would be
the first time a foreign head of state was denied the honor.

Clinton lawyers offer concessions to save presidency
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QC; 
 &UR; By RON FOURNIER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Political Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The legalisms and technicalities are gone.
Instead, the White House is reaching out with a series of
concessions and olive branches designed to save Bill Clinton's
presidency.
	   On the second and last day of his defense before the House
Judiciary Committee, his own witnesses signaled or conceded that
Clinton:
	   _May have lied under oath.
	   _Would accept a stiff censure to avoid impeachment.
	   _Might be subject to criminal prosecution after he leaves
office.
	   And Democratic lawmakers, working with the knowledge of the
White House, drafted a tough censure resolution that would
reprimand Clinton for making ``false statements concerning his
reprehensible conduct with a subordinate.'' It also flatly says he
remains open to criminal and civil penalties.
	   These moves are designed to offer political and legal
alternatives to impeachment _ and appeal to Republicans on the
fence.
	   ``Clearly, they are now doing everything they can to apologize
and be humble and get away from the arrogant strategy of the
past,'' said Republican consultant Ralph Reed. ``I think that's
wise, but my concern for the White House would be: Is it too little
too late?''
	   Indeed, even as the White House made its last-ditch appeal, the
Republicans recommended four articles of impeachment.
	   Reed and other Republicans believe the tide turned against
Clinton after he sent vague responses last month to the committee's
81 questions, many of which sought answers to whether Clinton gave
``false and misleading'' testimony under oath. The president has
grudgingly admitted to misleading investigators, but has never
given ground to Republicans on suggestions that he gave false
responses or lied.
	   White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff caved on both counts
Wednesday.
	   Asked if Clinton lied under oath, he said, ``Reasonable people
... could determine that he crossed over that line and that, what
for him was truthful but misleading or nonresponsive and misleading
or evasive, was, in fact, false.'' But he said it did not
constitute perjury.
	   Another witness for the defense, former Massachusetts Gov.
William Weld, proposed a vote of censure combined with: a written
report on Clinton's conduct; written acknowledgment of wrongdoing
by the president; a fine paid by Clinton; and the possibility of
criminal prosecution once Clinton leaves office.
	   ``It's a political suggestion,'' Weld said. ``because this is in
part a political process.''
	   White House officials and Weld said the moderate Republican did
not discuss his proposal with the administration beforehand. Yet he
was urged to testify by White House lobbyist Susan Brophy, and
Clinton supporters say none of Weld's suggestions are off the table
as far as Clinton is concerned.
	   ``He will do what he needs to do to save his presidency,'' said
one White House official.
	   Clinton will now gauge the reaction of moderates and wavering
Democrats to the two-day defense. If he can avoid impeachment
without taking further action, he will. If more dramatic steps need
to be taken, Ruff and perhaps even Weld provided a road map for how
far Clinton might be willing to go.
	   Indeed, Ruff touched on the possibility of Clinton facing
criminal prosecution after leaving office, telling the Judiciary
Committee, ``He is prepared to accept the obloquy that flows from
his misconduct and he recognizes that, like any citizen, he is and
will be subject to the rule of law.''

Brain substance that promotes appetite linked to alcohol intake
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A brain substance best known for stimulating
appetite may dampen the taste for alcohol, a study in rats
suggests.
	   Rats that overproduced neuropeptide Y drank less alcohol than
normal rats, while animals without any neuropeptide Y drank more
than usual. The abnormal levels of the substance had been created
through genetic manipulation.
	   In addition, mice with high levels of the substance were more
sensitive than normal to alcohol's sedating effects, while animals
without the substance were unusually insensitive to alcohol.
	   The work is reported in the Nov. 26 issue of the journal Nature
by researchers at the University of Washington in Seattle.
	   Since neuropeptide Y stimulates appetite, some scientists have
proposed using drugs that interfere with it as an obesity
treatment. The new work suggests such drugs might encourage alcohol
consumption, scientists at London's Hammersmith Hospital note in a
Nature commentary.
	   It will be crucial to find a way to separate neuropeptide Y's
effects on appetite from those on alcohol consumption, the
commentary said.

	   ROCHESTER, New York (AP) _ Researchers are recommending routine
blood tests for excess iron, which can produce a disorder that puts
people at increased risk for diabetes, cirrhosis, chronic fatigue
and heart disease.
	   Routine screening for hemochromatosis, a common but
underdiagnosed hereditary disorder, would save more lives than
screening for cholesterol levels, said Dr. Pradyumna Phatak, chief
of hematology and medical oncology at Rochester General Hospital.
	   The tests cost about dlrs 15 and would save billions of dollars
in health care costs, said Phatak, the chief researcher of a
four-year study of hemochromatosis involving 16,031 Rochester
patients.
	   The findings were reported in this week's Annals of Internal
Medicine.
	   The disorder causes the bowel to absorb too much iron _ as much
as twice the amount that it should. The mineral is then stored in
the liver, pituitary, heart, pancreas and other organ systems that
can later be overwhelmed and damaged.
	   The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is not
yet willing to recommend widespread screenings for the disorder.
	   However, doctors should ``increase their index of suspicion''
and be more aware of how to diagnose hemochromatosis, said Dr.
Sharon McDonnell, a CDC epidemiologist.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Two men whose epileptic seizures couldn't be
prevented by drugs got relief after fetal pig cells were implanted
in their brains, an encouraging but very preliminary result.
	   One 40-year-old patient had been averaging about one seizure a
month in which he blacked out. He hasn't had any such episodes
since the surgery July 2, said neurologist Dr. Steven Schachter of
Harvard Medical School.
	   A 45-year-old man had 22 seizures in the three months before his
surgery last January, but only 13 in three months following the
procedure, Schachter said. The seizures made the man unresponsive
and sometimes caused convulsions and confusion.
	   Both patients continued on medications after the cells were
transplanted. The second man eventually had the seizure-triggering
site in his brain removed, Schachter said in a recent telephone
interview.
	   The men were part of a study to see if the transplants were
feasible and safe. It's too soon to tell how useful they might be,
Schachter said. No side effects were observed.
	   Schachter did the work with neurologist Dr. Donald Schomer of
Harvard.
	   The researchers think the cells can reduce seizures by pumping
out a natural substance called GABA. Schachter said he hopes
transplants could eventually help people with epilepsy who can't be
satisfactorily treated with drugs or standard surgery.

General Assembly adopts first resolution mentioning anti-Semitism
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ On the 50th anniversary of the U.N.
convention against genocide, which was adopted because of the Nazi
slaughter of the Jews, the General Assembly passed a resolution
Wednesday acknowledging anti-Semitism for the first time.
	   ``In 50 years the U.N. General Assembly has never mentioned,
discussed, or used the word anti-Semitism,'' said Felice D. Gaer,
director of the American Jewish Committee's Jacob Blaustein
Institute for the Advancement of Human Rights.
	   Hostility against Israel and its Jewish supporters by the Arab
bloc and the Soviet Union kept the word anti-Semitism from being
included in the U.N. Convention on Racial Discrimination, the
Declaration on Religious Intolerance and any U.N. resolution, she
said.
	   In 1975, the General Assembly riled Israel by adopting a
resolution equating Zionism _ the founding ideology of the state
that gathered in Jews from the corners of the Earth _ with racism.
It was rescinded in 1991.
	   This year, as a result of U.S. lobbying, the end of the Cold
War, and earlier progress towards Middle East peace, Gaer said an
assembly resolution included anti-Semitism in a list of
``contemporary forms of racism and racial discrimination.''
	   The resolution, which was approved by consensus Wednesday, urged
all governments to cooperate with a U.N. special rapporteur in
examining incidents of racism and racial discrimination ``against
blacks, Arabs and Muslims, xenophobia, Negrophobia, anti-Semitism
and related intolerance.''
	   During a visit to Israel in March, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan had called for the 50th anniversary year of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights to focus on the eradication of
anti-Semitism.
	   ``This resolution shows that sometimes the General Assembly
responds to the sensitivity that Kofi Annan has for Jews and all
people,'' Gaer said.
	   She said it was significant that the resolution was adopted on
Dec. 9, the 50th anniversary of the 1948 Convention on the
Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.
	   The convention, which has been ratified by 127 states, was the
first human rights treaty adopted by the United Nations. It was
pushed avidly by a Polish Jew, Raphael Lemkin, who came up with the
word genocide, and its roots were in the Holocaust, she said.
	   In a message marking the 50th anniversary, Annan recalled that
genocide against Jews and others by the Nazis shaped the founding
of the United Nations.
	   ``Ensuring that genocide could never be repeated became, in many
peoples' eyes, the new world organization's most important
mission,'' he said.
	   By adopting the convention, the world pledged to prevent
genocide and punish the perpetrators but ``to our eternal shame, we
didn't do enough,'' Annan said, citing mass killings and ethnic
cleansing in this decade in the Balkans and Africa.
	   ``Let us all undertake to end this ultimate denial of human
rights, and the impunity that has allowed it to continue,'' he
said.

Palestinian ex-fighters to be out in force for Clinton visit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ It's not exactly the kind of
company President Bill Clinton normally keeps.
	   In the Gaza Strip, the welcome mat is out not only for the
American leader, but for hundreds of now-aging veterans of the era
when Palestinians pressed their cause the world over by hijacking
airliners, shooting up airports and staging guerrilla raids.
	   The centerpiece of Clinton's visit to Gaza on Monday is a
meeting of the Palestine National Council, a nearly 600-member
parliament-in-exile, which along with other Palestinian groups is
to reaffirm in his presence that the Palestinians have renounced
the goal of destroying Israel.
	   Like much else connected with the visit _ and the Wye River
land-for-security accord Clinton is coming here to promote _ the
Gaza gathering is viewed very differently by the two sides.
	   Palestinians consider the ex-fighters attending the session to
be heroes of a national struggle that they hope will culminate in
Palestinian statehood.
	   Israelis, however, can't stand the prospect of bringing together
what they regard as a notorious who's who of terrorism, a rogues'
gallery responsible for taking hundreds of innocent lives.
	   ``It's certainly not a group or body that we value, to say the
least,'' Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel said of the
Palestine National Council.
	   Some former guerrillas are boycotting the meeting to express
their continuing opposition to any peace with Israel.
	   ``What will happen in Gaza does not represent the real will of
the Palestinian people,'' said PNC member Leila Khaled, a onetime
Palestinian commando who hijacked airliners in 1969 and 1970.
	   Those expected to attend include Mohammed Abbas, who oversaw the
1985 hijacking of the Achille Lauro cruise ship in which an elderly
American passenger was shot dead in his wheelchair, and Mohammed
Oudeh, implicated by Israeli and American intelligence experts in
planning the botched hostage-taking at the 1972 Munich Olympics
that left 11 Israeli athletes dead.
	   Using its security veto over who enters Gaza, Israel has banned
some ex-fighters now living abroad, including members of the
radical Syrian-based Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine,
from attending the session.
	   But Israel cannot keep too many PNC members away or it will
defeat the main purpose of the meeting, which it itself insisted
upon: amending the Palestinian national charter to nullify clauses
calling for Israel's destruction.
	   Israel and the Palestinians strongly disagree over exactly how
that should be accomplished.
	   The Palestinians say they already renounced the offending
clauses in a 1996 meeting of the PNC and in a subsequent letter
from Arafat to then-Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
	   Reflecting that, official Palestinian invitations to the
gathering merely ask those attending to listen to a speech by
Clinton in support of the peace accords.
	   Palestinian leaders have said the abandonment of a call to arms
against Israel will be affirmed by acclamation, not by an actual
vote. But Israel wants a formal tally, and warns that without one,
the peace accord is off.
	   ``We're not going to accept any halfway, vague actions by the
PNC,'' said Fogel, the Israeli spokesman.
	   Whatever distaste Israel feels about the session is amply
reciprocated by some of the former Palestinian fighters who plan to
attend.
	   Oudeh, who is better known by his code name of Abu Daoud,
singles out Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, whom many
Palestinians blame for the 1982 massacre of hundreds of Palestinian
refugees in Lebanon by Israeli-allied Christian militiamen.
	   ``Who is he to talk about us having blood on our hands?'' he
said.
	   Some of those who will be rubbing elbows with Clinton at the
Gaza gathering have distanced themselves from past acts of
violence.
	   Abbas, who oversaw the Achille Lauro hijacking, has said
publicly for several years now that the operation was a mistake.
	   Other PNC members remain defiant, insisting their bloody tactics
were a legitimate means of bringing the Palestinian plight to the
world's attention.
	   Leila Khaled, now a 54-year-old women's activist and mother of
two children, said in a telephone interview from Amman, Jordan,
that she had no regrets about her hijacker past.
	   Oudeh, 61 and a lawyer in the West Bank town of Ramallah, was
never charged in the Munich massacre and does not acknowledge
direct involvement in it. But he says attacks like it ultimately
led to peace negotiations with Israel.
	   ``It was a field of struggle,'' he said. ``Maybe we fought too
much, but we suffered too much too. Now we've come halfway across
the bridge. It's time the Israelis did too.''

Judge delays move to impeach witness in Anwar trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The judge in the trial of Anwar
Ibrahim delayed Thursday a move by the jailed politician's lawyers
to prove a key prosecution witness lied in court.
	   Trial Judge Augustine Paul, who on Wednesday allowed the defense
to begin impeachment proceedings against the witness, appeared to
change his mind as the court assembled Thursday.
	   The witness is a former employee of Anwar who alleges that the
ex-deputy prime minister repeatedly sodomized him. Defense lawyers
said this week there were glaring inconsistencies in the witness'
story.
	   Judge Paul said the impeachment move seemed to be based on
``mere speculation.''
	   ``I am afraid I will have to reconsider the decision I have
made,'' he said. Paul said a final ruling would be made later.
	   Defense lawyers did not react to the judge's remarks.
	   They had requested the impeachment of Azizan Abu Bakar after
Azizan appeared to contradict himself when he said during
cross-examination that he never had sex with the ousted deputy
prime minister.
	   If the defense can prove Azizan lied, it could weaken the
prosecution's case against Anwar and its goal of convicting him on
10 charges of corruption and illegal sex. Azizan's accusations form
the basis for the bulk of the prosecution's case.
	   Anwar is being tried on four counts of corruption. He will face
trial at a later date for one more charge of corruption and five
for alleged illegal sex acts.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar on Sept. 2, accusing
him of being morally unfit for office. The sacking led to demands
for political reforms and massive anti-government protests in the
normally placid Southeast Asian capital.

	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Tears welling in her eyes, the leader of
a group whose relatives disappeared during Gen. Augusto Pinochet's
rule praised Britain's decision Wednesday to let Spain begin steps
to extradite the former dictator.
	   ``It's not only important for us and our loved ones, but for all
of mankind,'' said Viviana Diaz, whose father, Victor, a top
Communist Party official, disappeared in 1974 after his arrest by
Pinochet's secret police.
	   It is time for Pinochet to ``finally respond before a court for
his crimes,'' Ms. Diaz said.
	   But although Ms. Diaz and the relatives of others who were
killed or disappeared during Pinochet's 17-year rule celebrated
Wednesday's decision, others expressed anger and sorrow.
	   Police used water cannons Wednesday night to disperse scores of
angry pro-Pinochet demonstrators near the British and Spanish
embassies in Santiago's upper-class Las Condes district. At least
13 demonstrators were detained.
	   About 80 anti-Pinochet demonstrators marched peacefully 30
blocks away in downtown Santiago to celebrate British Home
Secretary Jack Straw's ruling.
	   The mixed reaction reflected the deep divisions in Chile about
Pinochet. The former dictator's Oct. 16 arrest in a London
hospital, where he was recovering from back surgery, set off days
of street protests by his supporters and detractors.
	   Chile's government immediately withdrew its ambassador in
protest of Straw's ruling. But Interior Minister Raul Troncoso
insisted there were no plans to sever or suspend ties with Britain,
and he appealed for calm, urging Chileans to guard against
``impassioned reactions.''
	   Troncoso called the ruling a violation of Pinochet's immunity as
a Chilean senator and vowed the government would ``use all the
means possible to have this decision reversed.''
	   Chilean President Eduardo Frei, who was in Brazil for a trade
conference, said his country would appeal the decision,
	   Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza, who was with Frei in
Brazil, said the appeal would be filed by next week at the latest.
But, he said, he did not think the extradition proceedings would
undermine Chile's diplomatic relations with England or Spain.

Waugh and Warne find support in Australian test side
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Embattled Australian cricketers Wark
Waugh and Shane Warne, who have admitted to taking money from an
Indian bookmaker, have the full support of the Australian test
team, captain Mark Taylor said Thursday.
	   On the eve of the third Ashes test against England in Adelaide,
Taylor said he asked all members of the current team at a meeting
on Tuesday whether they had any problems playing with Waugh or
Warne _ all said they did not.
	   ``They have our full and 100 percent support,'' Taylor said.
	   Warne and Waugh, two of Australia's most popular and
highest-paid players, admitted Wednesday to being ``naive and
stupid'' for taking money from an Indian bookmaker during
Australia's 1994 tour of Sri Lanka.
	   The revelation, made worse by an admission by the Australian
Cricket Board (ACB) that it had covered up the affair and asked the
International Cricket Council to do the same, has plunged
Australian cricket into crisis.
	   Taylor said Thursday he knew about the matter during the 1994
tour, and described the pair as foolish.
	   ``It worried me at the time because they compromised
themselves,'' Taylor
	   said. ``But I knew they hadn't done anything to jeopardize
Australian cricket.
	   ``They did the wrong thing and took a cheap dollar.
	   ``Two guys took a fast buck, nothing more than that and their
records as individuals ... since 1994 (are) second to none.''
	   The ACB fined Waugh 10,000 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 6,400)
and Warne
	   8,000 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 5,100) for selling
information about weather and pitch conditions to the bookmaker.
	   The revelation shook the cricket world and is almost certain to
force the
	   International Cricket Council to address the subject of illegal
betting in the sport at its meeting next month in Christchurch, New
Zealand.
	   At a media conference Wednesday in Adelaide, Warne and Waugh
each read a statement but refused to answer questions, leaving ACB
chief executive Malcolm Speed to deal with the matter.
	   The ACB kept the matter secret until late Tuesday and Speed
admitted the incident's leaking had damaged Australian cricket's
reputation.
	   Both Waugh and Warne denied any involvement in match fixing or
bribery and told Speed they had never bet on cricket.
	   Taylor on Thursday joined in criticism of the ACB, saying it was
mistaken.
	   ``My feelings are exactly the same as they were at the time,
they made a mistake and they've admitted that mistake,'' Taylor
said of the board.
	   Waugh said he took money from the Delhi-based bookmaker to
provide information the batsman considered ``mundane.''
	   ``At no stage did I discuss team tactics or lineups,'' Waugh
said.
	   Warne, whose hopes of one day being the Australian cricket
captain will be damaged by the revelations, said he deeply
regretted the contact with the
	   bookmaker who gave him money in return for answering routine
questions about
	   the state of the pitch and the weather.
	   ``I've had no contact with the bookmaker since and am very
disappointed and sorry for my actions,'' he said.
	   Waugh and Warne's admissions and the ACB's behavior have been
widely condemned by cricket commentators, in newspaper editorials
and by the public generally. (rs/djp)

Rights group vows worldwide campaign for Egyptian activists
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BASSEM MROUE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Human Rights Watch will launch a worldwide
campaign to defend Egyptian activists, says an official who accused
the Egyptian government of intimidating those who ``expose its
grave human rights record.''
	   The campaign, which was to begin Thursday, is in response to the
Dec. 1 arrest of Hafez Abu Saada, head of the Egyptian Organization
for Human Rights, which recently reported widespread torture by
police of Coptic Christians in a southern village.
	   Police accused Abu Saada of accepting illegal foreign donations
and publishing false reports that damaged Egypt's image. Conviction
could result in a prison sentence of up to 15 years at hard labor.
Abu Saada was released on bail Sunday.
	   The accusations ``represent a direct threat to the entire human
rights community in Egypt,'' Hanny Megally of the New York-based
Human Rights Watch said in a statement.
	   ``It appears that the Egyptian government is trying to
intimidate and silence the voices that continue to expose its grave
human rights record,'' according to the statement.
	   The campaign was made public Thursday, the anniversary of the
50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
	   ``Today the world celebrates the principles of respect for human
rights. But the Egyptian government is betraying these values,''
said Megally, the executive director of his group's Middle East and
North Africa division.
	   In a telephone interview later, Megally said that beginning
Thursday, the group's representatives in Europe, the United States
and other countries will lobby local governments to pressure Egypt
on improving its human rights record.
	   He said a Human Rights Watch delegation will travel to Egypt to
meet activists, ambassadors and diplomats based in Cairo as part of
the campaign.
	   ``The danger we are seeing these days is that the human rights
movement in Egypt is under government pressure and it needs help.
We should defend it,'' he said.
	   Officials at Egypt's interior ministry were not available for
comment.
	   Abu Saada was detained after a weekly magazine disclosed that
his group, EOHR, took a dlrs 25,000 donation from a British
Parliament committee.
	   Police are investigating whether the money was a ``payment'' for
an EOHR report that accused police of arresting and torturing
hundreds of Copts in a criminal investigation in the village of
El-Kusheh in August.
	   The government has denied the torture allegations.
	   EOHR said the money was part of legitimate aid and has still
returned the money to prove its neutrality. Also Wednesday,
prosecutors arrested another EOHR activist, Mustafa Zeidan, who
visited al-Kusheh to investigate. He was freed on bail.
	   Megally's statement said the intimidation of human rights
defenders in Egypt is ``particularly troubling'' in light of wider
human rights abuses.
	   Egyptians, irrespective of gender, age, religious beliefs and
political orientation are subjected to ``indiscriminate brutality''
by security forces, sometimes leading to custody deaths, it said.

Satellite, cable TV operators see rosy future in Asia after crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JONATHAN DRAKE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Despite slower growth since the economic crisis
struck Asia, cable and satellite television operators meeting in
Singapore predict a generally rosy future for the industry in the
region.
	   ``We all agree its been a very tough year in Asia for all
industries, cable and satellite TV included,'' Frank Brown,
president of MTV Asia, told The Associated Press on Wednesday
during a conference of regional broadcasters.
	   But these TV operators will benefit from recent cost-cutting and
efficiency-boosting measures, he argued, and quick growth will
return when the region lifts itself out of the slowdown.
	   ``I think we're over the worst of it already,'' said Brown. ``I
think by the second half of 1999 we'll start to see recovery and
return to growth for individual economies of Asia and also for the
cable and satellite industry regionally.''
	   Last year, an estimated one in five Asian households already
subscribed to a cable and satellite service, and the numbers will
continue to rise, said Singapore's Information and Arts Minister
George Yeo during a speech opening the three-day conference.
	   ``Once the region recovers, which it would in a few years, the
broadcast industry would resume its rapid growth,'' said Yeo.
	   Much of the sector's early growth was due to public enthusiasm
over a wide choice of viewing choices after decades of extremely
limited options, CNBC Asia president Paul France said during a
panel discussion.
	   CNBC Asia is a regional television news broadcaster owned by
U.S. companies.
	   Although optimistic about the industry's potential in Asia,
France warned that viewers now are more discerning, so satellite
and cable TV operators must customize and market their product more
effectively to return to previously robust levels of growth.
	   He noted that several pay-TV markets in Asia have not yet
progressed past the simple provision of choice.
	   While most Asian operators have been hurt by the crisis, some
have managed to buck the trend of slower growth. MTV Asia, based in
Singapore, has seen its distribution skyrocket since the regional
economic slump started: from 57 million homes last year to 96
million homes.
	   MTV's Brown attributed this surprising performance to their
aggressive marketing, careful attention to customizing their
broadcast for particular countries and a young target audience that
has not suffered from the downturn as much as other segments of the
regional population.
	   But most cable and satellite services in Asia are especially
eager for an end to the regional downturn, when advertising
revenues are expected to pick up again.
	   ``I do believe though that if things do not improve as soon as
the second half of '99, then the industry is in a good position to
just hunker down and go for steady growth,'' added Brown.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Russian scientists are developing a cocktail of
bacteria to digest underpants in what is hoped will be an ``Eat my
shorts'' answer to the problem of what to do with astronauts' dirty
underwear, a magazine reports.
	   The project, aimed at long space missions lasting months, such
as a trip to Mars, is reported in this week's issue of New
Scientist, a London-based science magazine.
	   The resulting methane gas given off by the disposal unit could
then be used to power the spacecraft, the scientists told the
magazine.
	   ``This will be a revolution in the science of biodegradation,''
Vyacheslav Ilyin, head of the microbial ecology laboratory at the
Russian State Research Center's Institute for Biological and
Medical Problems, told the magazine.
	   Ilyin could not immediately be reached for comment Wednesday
night.
	   Onboard washing machines are not exactly a priority, and in the
United States, astronauts are rationed to a gallon and a half of
water a day for a shower. Underwear is changed daily on U.S.
shuttle missions and every three days on space station missions,
NASA said.
	   ``Cosmonauts identify waste as one of the most acute problems
they encounter in space,'' Ilyin was quoted as saying.
	   The search for the most suitable combination of microbes is
expected to take up to a decade, New Scientist said. Researchers
aim to have the device ready by 2017, when Russia hopes to launch
its first crewed interplanetary mission.
	   Aboard Mir, the Russian space station, waste is stored in sealed
containers until a module arrives with fresh supplies. The waste is
then transferred to the module to be burned up when the spacecraft
re-enters the Earth's atmosphere, the magazine said.
	   But the modules only call about twice a year, the magazine said.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Russian scientists are developing a cocktail of
bacteria to digest underpants in what is hoped will be an ``Eat my
shorts'' answer to the problem of what to do with astronauts' dirty
underwear, a magazine reports.
	   The project, aimed at long space missions lasting months, such
as a trip to Mars, is reported in this week's issue of New
Scientist, a London-based science magazine.
	   The resulting methane gas given off by the disposal unit could
then be used to power the spacecraft, the scientists told the
magazine.
	   ``This will be a revolution in the science of biodegradation,''
Vyacheslav Ilyin, head of the microbial ecology laboratory at the

Australians stunned, outraged, disillusioned with cricket scandal

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The prime minister suddenly appeared on
nationwide television, standing somberly in front of an Australian
flag, to say ``something that's going to deeply disturb
Australians.''
	   Though John Howard's demeanor was solemn enough for an
announcement of the death of the Queen, he spoke of something far
deeper and more dear to Aussies than Her Majesty -- the scandal
engulfing Australian cricket.
	   Newspapers, broadcasters and Australians in the street were
incandescent with rage Thursday that top cricketers Shane Warne and
Mark Waugh took money from an Indian bookie in 1994 for weather and
playing field tips.
	   The aspect that enraged most people even more though, was that
the Australian Cricket Board kept the matter secret until this week
-- a case of Cricket-gate.
	   ``The Australian Cricket Board is guilty of hypocrisy in its
attitude to cricket's gambling problem. The board has pressed for
an inquiry into allegations of match-fixing in Pakistan while
engaging in a concerted cover-up of its own betting scandal,'' The
Australian national newspaper said in a front-page editorial.
	   ``Australia Mourns as the Game Falls from its Pedestal,'' cried
the Sydney Morning Herald's headline Thursday.
	   Cricket is deeply ingrained in Australia's consciousness, with
the nation measuring itself against Britain, the mother country, on
the cricket green.
	   The Ashes tour, the big confrontation between Britain and
Australia, is now on, and the third match in the series begins
Friday in Adelaide.
	   The Australian team has bested Britain for years, but this
scandal turned two of the top Aussie players from ``heroes into
zeros overnight'' in the eyes of most people, the Australian
Broadcasting Corp. said.
	   ``I would imagine that, given the great passion that Australians
have for cricket, there's an intense feeling of disappointment
about the whole issue,'' said Howard, the prime minister.
	   ``Australians love their cricket and anything that looks as
though it's knocking cricket off its pedestal is something that's
going to deeply disturb Australians,'' he said, with considerable
understatement.
	   The Australian's headline read: ``The Bookie Scandal -- 11,000
Dollars: Price of Disgrace,'' referring to the Australian dollar
payments the bookie gave Warne and Waugh during the 1994 tour of
Sri Lanka.
	   Both players admitted they were ``naive and stupid'' at a news
conference Wednesday, then denied they had ever taken a bribe or
thrown a match and walked out without answering questions from
reporters.
	   ``Ashamed -- And So You Bloody Well Should Be!'' read the
headline in the tabloid Daily Telegraph of Sydney on Thursday. Its
editorial was headlined, ``Wounding the soul of a nation.''
	   ``I believe this may be cricket's biggest crisis since 1817,''
wrote Matthew Engel, editor of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack,
considered the ``Bible'' of cricket, in an essay in the Herald.
	   ``This calls into question the whole morality of the game, the
concept of what is and is not cricket,'' Engel wrote.
	   ``So what happened in 1817? The same thing. Cricket rose to
prominence in England in the 18th century as a gambling game.
Eventually, the betting overwhelmed the sport. Corruption took
over,'' he said. Bookies were banned -- until 1973.
	   Two weeks before Christmas, most Australians seem to feel they
same way they did after they learned, at some age, that Santa Claus
was a hoax -- disillusioned, enraged, ashamed at their own
gullibility.
	   They will go on to celebrate Christmas, and they will keep on
attending cricket matches, but only with a sense of innocence lost.

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Northern Ireland's David Trimble and John
Hume said their acceptance Thursday of the Nobel Peace Prize does
not mean an end to their efforts in trying to end nearly 30 years
of sectarian violence in the British province.
	   In their acceptance speeches, both said theirs was a prize for
an incomplete peace. An accord reached in April hit a new snag last
week over disarmament of paramilitary groups.
	   ``We have a peace in Ireland. But it is still something of an
armed peace,'' Trimble, the leader of Northern Ireland's largest
Protestant party, the Ulster Unionist Party, said according to a
text of his remarks released in advance.
	   ``It may seem strange that we receive the reward of a race run
while the race is still not quite finished. But the paramilitaries
are finished. But the politics are not finished,'' Trimble's text
said. He vowed to see the accord implemented.
	   In his own speech, Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and
Labor Party, Northern Ireland's largest Roman Catholic party, also
said there would be difficulties ahead.
	   But quoting another Nobel peace laureate, American civil rights
activist Martin Luther King Jr., Hume vowed that ``we shall
overcome,'' his advance text said.
	   The politicians were picked for the peace prize, which includes
a 7.6 million Swedish kronor (dlrs 938,000) cash award, because the
Norwegian awards committee saw them as the two key figures in talks
that lead to what is now called the Good Friday Agreement.
	   The five-member committee has often used the prize to nurture
difficult, ongoing peace processes. This is the second time it has
tried in Northern Ireland. The 1976 prize went to Betty Williams
and Mairead Corrigan for founding a peace movement that later
fizzled.
	   ``We all know that there are still major problems to be faced,''
said awards committee chairman Francis Sejersted, according to a
copy of his planned speech. But, he said, there could be no turning
back, even if there are setbacks.
	   Hume, 61, and Trimble, 54, accept their awards, which include a
gold medal, before about 1,000 people, including Norway's King
Harald V and Queen Sonja, at the Oslo City Hall.
	   The ceremony was being held in the shadow of a deadlock in the
peace process. Last week, Trimble's party demanded that the
outlawed Irish Republican Army begin to disarm before its political
wing Sinn Fein is allowed to join a new governing body for Northern
Ireland.
	   ``All I have asked for is a credible beginning. All I have asked
for is that they say the `war' is over. And that is proved by such
a beginning,'' Trimble's advance text said. ``Any further delay
will reinforce dark doubts about whether Sinn Fein are drinking
from the clear stream of democracy or still drinking from the dark
stream of fascism.''
	   On Thursday, Sinn Fein's chief negotiator Martin McGuinness
accused Trimble of provoking a crisis with his insistence that the
IRA surrender its huge weapons stockpiles.
	   The April peace agreement called for Protestant and Catholic
politicians forming a multiparty administration for Northern
Ireland and joint policy-making bodies with the Irish Republic by
October. Neither of those steps have been taken, even though Irish
voters endorsed the accord in May referendums.
	   ``We owe this peace to the ordinary people of Ireland,,'' said
Hume's text. He also credited the peace's backers, including U.S.
President Bill Clinton, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his
Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern.
	   ``Too many lives have already been lost in Ireland in the
pursuit of political goals,'' Hume's text said. ``The challenge
now, is to grasp and shape history.''
	   Trimble, who long resisted concessions to Northern Ireland's
Catholics, urged a pragmatic search for lasting peace.
	   ``We have started. And we will go on,'' he said.
	   The Nobel prizes were endowed by Swedish industrialist Alfred
Nobel, the inventor of dynamite. The prizes, first awarded in 1901,
are always presented on the Dec. 10 anniversary of Nobel's death.
The peace prize is awarded in Oslo, and the others in Stockholm,
Sweden.
	   Last year's peace prize went to the International Campaign to
Ban Landmines and its American coordinator Jody Williams.

Victims of human rights abuses remind world of violence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Zarghuna Waziri described how she was
beaten twice by Afghanistan's Taliban militia because she is a
woman. Polish sisters Justyna and Paulina recounted how traffickers
kidnapped them and dumped them at a German nightclub. And Maria
Gerardina Lopez told how exposure to pesticides at a banana
plantation in Costa Rica ruined her health and sex life.
	   On the eve of Thursday's 50th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, women who suffered human rights abuses
appeared at a mock tribunal to remind the world of the domestic
violence, widespread abuse, trafficking, and denial of property
rights that millions of women still face every day.
	   ``Fifty years after governments of the world proclaimed the
fundamental principles of all human rights for all, women
throughout the world remain woefully unprotected,'' said Charlotte
Bunch, director of the Center for Women's Global Leadership at
Rutger's University.
	   ``There have been many advances for women over the past 50 years
especially in the rhetorical commitments made to the idea of
equality. Yet, these advances are uneven and have not yet touched
the lives of millions around the world, even as they are being
threatened by the forces of backlash,'' she said.
	   During the past year, more than 250 organizations in 80
countries have participated in the center's 1998 Global Campaign
for Women's Rights. They have celebrated women's successes with
exhibits, lobbied politicians, and held marches, vigils and
tribunals from Bolivia to Nigeria to remind the United Nations and
governments of the promises they have made to ensure women's human
rights.
	   The campaign built on the 150-page blueprint adopted at the 1995
U.N. women's conference in Beijing to make equality of the sexes a
reality in the 21st century. But Bunch lamented Wednesday that even
though the Beijing platform was adopted by 189 states, at the rate
it is being implemented and funded by governments ``it will be more
like the 23rd century rather than the 21st before we see
substantial progress.''
	   In recent days, both the U.N. Security Council and the General
Assembly have condemned one of the worst denials of women's rights
_ the Taliban's refusal to allow Afghan women to go to school or
work outside their homes.
	   Waziri, a teacher, described how she was beaten unconscious by
the Taliban in June 1997 when she lifted a corner of her face
covering on a Kabul street because she had a bad headache and
couldn't breathe _ and how she was beaten again on April 22 along
with other women and children waiting at a Kabul hospital.
	   ``Sick babies in their mothers' arms fell on the floor,'' she
said, ``and then the Taliban started beating doctors with whips and
metal cables. We kept asking why? Why are you beating us?,'' she
said.
	   The Polish sisters, whose last name was not disclosed, described
how as 16 year olds in 1996 they were spirited across the border
and passed on to German traffickers. Their ordeal ended when the
club was raided, and they are now back in Poland at university, but
still undergoing counseling.
	   Even though the German traffickers were imprisoned for three
years, they were banned from entering Germany because they had
worked there without a permit. ``We were treated like criminals
even though we were victims,'' they complained.
	   Lopez Cortes said that she and other women are fighting for
compensation for the mental and physical damage caused by toxic
pesticides used on the banana plantations _ but the women who were
exposed ``will not have the strength or life span to bring to an
end this struggle.''

	   LONDON (AP) _ Relations between Britain and Chile plunged to a
new after Home Secretary Jack Straw decided to allow Spain to start
extraditing Gen. Augusto Pinochet on charges of torture and
conspiracy to murder.
	   Chile denounced the decision Wednesday as a violation of its
sovereignty, immediately withdrew its ambassador from Britain ''as
a gesture'' and pledged to appeal Straw's ruling on behalf of the
former Chilean dictator by next week.
	   Meanwhile, Britain's Foreign Secretary Robin Cook rushed to
limit the diplomatic damage by writing to his Chilean counterpart
Jose Miguel Insulza, saying he wanted ''to do everything possible
to maintain'' the relationship between the longtime allies.
	   But even as the government scrambled to prevent a fallout,
members of Straw's Labor Party could not hide their glee, breaking
into applause Wednesday evening when the home secretary entered the
House of Commons chamber.
	   Straw's decision to give the Spanish extradition request the
''authority to proceed'' came two weeks after Britain's highest
court, the House of Lords, ruled that Pinochet had no immunity from
arrest as a former foreign head of state. Spanish magistrate
Baltasar Garzon wants to try the general for human rights abuses
committed during his 17-year-regime.
	   A Chilean government report says 3,197 people were murdered or
disappeared at the hands of the secret police after Pinochet
overthrew Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist, in 1973.
	   In making his decision, Straw said he rejected complaints that a
judge who swung the 3-2 House of Lords ruling against Pinochet was
biased because of links to a human rights group. Straw also said he
did not find the general ''unfit to stand trial.''
	   Pinochet, who was arrested in his hospital bed Oct. 16 while
recuperating from back surgery in London, must now appear Friday
before a London magistrate. The general's lawyers, meanwhile, were
preparing to seek an immediate judicial review of Straw's decision.
	   This begins a legal battle that will likely stretch for months,
as both sides can appeal at every step of the process.
	   Human rights groups, who had been lobbying Straw as had the
Chilean government and others, hailed Wednesday's decision as a
landmark ruling, especially coming as it did on the eve of the 50th
anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
	   But the opposition Conservative Party condemned Straw's refusal
to consider Chile's request to send Pinochet home. The Chilean
government maintains that the crisis threatens the fragile
democracy set up after Pinochet stepped down in 1990, and that
crimes committed in Chile should be prosecuted in Chile. Before
relinquishing power, however, Pinochet gave himself widespread
immunity.
	   In Chile, reaction to Straw's move was mixed. Chilean President
Eduardo Frei, who was in Brazil for a trade conference, appealed
for calm and called on Pinochet's relatives to ''not be overtaken
by passion.'' An angry pro-Pinochet protest near the British and
Spanish embassies had to be dispersed Wednesday night by police
water canons. An anti-Pinochet march went on peacefully.
	   The British Foreign Office said it was monitoring the situation
with regard to any backlashes against Britons.

Surgery is riskier than no treatment for some brain aneurysms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to ADD that study in Thursday's New England
Journal of Medicine.
 &UR; By JANET McCONNAUGHEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) _ Surgery may be riskier than no treatment at
all for many patients with small brain aneurysms, spots where a
weak wall in a blood vessel has bulged out.
	   A major study found that if someone has never had a burst
aneurysm before, the chance that a small one in the front of the
brain will rupture and cause a stroke is less than one-twentieth of
1 percent a year.
	   By comparison, there is about a 10 percent risk of death or
brain damage from surgery to repair such an aneurysm, the study
found. A small aneurysm was defined as one about three-eighths of
an inch or less.
	   ``It would be very difficult to improve upon that natural
history,'' said the study's director, Dr. David O. Wiebers of the
Mayo Clinic.
	   The study is reported in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine.
	   The risks of surgery were larger than previous studies
indicated, partly because this one included patients' problems in
thinking, while earlier studies looked at their problems with
movement and their ability to care for themselves.
	   About 5 percent of people _ 10 million to 15 million Americans _
either have or will develop an intracranial aneurysm, where a weak
spot balloons out in the wall of an artery in the brain.
	   These bulges are a small but very deadly cause of strokes. Burst
aneurysms cause about 20 percent of all strokes _ 600,000 out of 3
million in 1996 in the United States _ but about 80 percent of
stroke deaths, or about 128,300 deaths.
	   What hasn't been clear is whether doctors should operate to fix
these weak spots before they break. To help settle the issue,
Wiebers directed a study of 2,721 patients at 53 hospitals in the
United States, Canada and Europe.
	   It is the first big study to look at when surgery is needed to
fix aneurysms, said Dr. John Marler of the National Institutes of
Health, which paid for it.
	   Ten years ago, doctors found only one ballooned brain artery for
every nine that already had burst. But the question of preventive
surgery is coming up more and more often because brain scans
performed for other reasons are finding more aneurysms.
	   ``You don't like to be walking around knowing there's a weakness
in a blood vessel in your brain and it can pop out and kill you.
You want to think there's something you can do,'' Marler said.
``This helps answer the question: `What should I do now that you've
found this thing?'''
	   It is unclear how many operations could be avoided because of
the new study. Marler guessed that doctors operate on perhaps 1
percent of small aneurysms that aren't causing any other problems.
But even 1 percent translates to 100,000 operations.
	   Still, doctors warned that the study should not be taken as a
warning against any surgery. Each case must be decided on its own,
and a 60-year-old and a 30-year-old may have different ideas about
what risk is acceptable, they said.
	   ``A generalization that an intracranial aneurysm is little risk
and nothing needs to be done would be grossly misleading and
dangerous,'' said Dr. Neil Martin, a neurosurgeon and co-director
of the UCLA Stroke Center.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar dropped against the yen Thursday
morning after Japan's finance minister reportedly criticized U.S.
foreign exchange policy. Japanese stock prices rose moderately.
	   The dollar bought 117.96 yen, down 0.82 yen from late Wednesday
in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 117.82 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 47.31
points, or 0.32 percent, to close the morning session at 14,979.21.
On Wednesday, the average closed up 123.70 points, or 0.84 percent.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar's move followed reported
comments by Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa during a parliamentary
session Wednesday.
	   Kyodo News agency quoted Miyazawa as saying the United States
``desires a strong dollar when U.S. industry is robust and wishes
for the reverse when it is weak.''
	   Miyazawa said he sees nothing ``consistent'' in U.S. currency
policy, Kyodo said. He suggested that the United States feels
comfortable seeing the dollar at around 110 yen or 120 yen, the
report said.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the market's main index opened
lower but climbed following blue chip buying by a Japanese
securities company, analysts said.
	   ``Daiwa Securities continued to buy wide baskets of blue chips,
propelling the market higher,'' said Dhia Amir, a senior trader at
Nomura Securities.
	   Speculation that public funds were buying ahead of the
government's fourth offering of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
shares also pushed stock prices higher, he said.
	   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 9009.19
points Wednesday, down 18.79.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 4.62 points, or 0.41 percent, to 1,145.36. The
TOPIX closed up 8.75 points, or 0.77 percent, the day before.
	   Market players said investors remain somewhat cautious ahead of
the special quotation for the settlement of futures and options
contracts Friday, and the release of the Japanese central bank's
quarterly survey of business sentiment, or tankan, on Monday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.180 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.110
percent, driving its price down to 105.29 yen from 105.92 yen.

Howard lauds Australian human rights record but warns Aborigines
</HEADLINE>
are vulnerable &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard on
Thursday lauded Australia's record on human rights as second to
none, but warning that Aborigines and indigenous people have
ongoing problems.
	   Howard was speaking on a motion recognizing the 50th anniversary
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
	   He said he was proud of Australia's stance on human rights,
while warning against hectoring other countries about their
records.
	   ``At home Australia has built a society which places the utmost
importance on the values of decency, fairness and tolerance,
respect for the rights and freedoms of others is a continuing
hallmark of our nation,'' he told Parliament.
	   ``Our record in this regard is second to none and as prime
minister I am always proud to promote it internationally.''
	   But he warned there were still problems in Australia.
	   ``I don't pretend for a moment our human rights record has been
without blemish and I don't pretend for a moment that continued
areas of poverty and deprivation and disadvantage within our
society in 1998 don't represent some diminution of the human rights
of the people who comprise those particular groups,'' he said.
	   That included indigenous people, he said.
	   Thee are fewer than 400,000 Aborigines among Australia's 18
million people, but they have always been the poorest,
shortest-lived and least healthy group in society.
	   Howard also warned against Australia lecturing other countries
on human rights.
	   ``Abroad Australian governments of all political stripes have
always taken seriously their responsibility to promote observance
of human rights throughout the world,'' he said.
	   ``That does not mean that we always engage in hectoring other
countries with different histories and different customs, but the
coalition government will always make its views clearly known on
the fundamental necessity of respect for human rights.''
	   The commitment to human rights started at home, he said.
	   ``If you don't respect the human rights of your own people, then
you can hardly put yourself in a position to lecture the rest of
the world,'' he said.

Top opposition leader's brother charged with raising illegal funds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The brother of the head of South
Korea's largest opposition party was arrested Thursday on charges
of raising illegal political funds during last year's presidential
election campaign.
	   Lee Hoi-sung, 54, an adviser to a government-funded energy
research center, was accused of collecting 15 billion won (dlrs
11.5 million) for his brother, Lee Hoi-chang, 62, then the ruling
party's presidential candidate.
	   The younger Lee allegedly colluded with top national tax
officials to pressure major business leaders to contribute funds to
his brother's campaign.
	   Under South Korean law, all political contributions should be
made through official party channels or a neutral election
management committee.
	   In the Dec. 18 election, Lee Hoi-chang lost to opposition
candidate Kim Dae-jung by a narrow margin. It marked the first
transfer of power from a ruling party to an opposition party in
South Korean history.
	   After the new government was installed early this year, Lim
Chae-ju, then head of the National Tax Office, was arrested for
alleged involvement in the illegal fund raising. His deputy, Lee
Suk-hee, fled to the United States to escape arrest.
	   Prosecutors said the tax officials gave tax cuts and other
favors to companies that contributed to Lee's campaign.
	   The opposition leader and his brother have denied involvement in
the scheme, but prosecutors said they have enough evidence to
incriminate them.
	   Prosecutors have said they will summon the opposition leader for
questioning.

UN mission in Bougainville to stay for another year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council decided to keep two
U.N. political officers in Bougainville, the secessionist island of
Papua New Guinea, for another year to help cement a cease-fire that
ended a decade-long conflict.
	   In a statement read Wednesday by council president Jassim
Mohammed Buallay of Bahrain, the council said it would review the
status of the tiny observer mission in another six months. Another
officer and two military advisers are expected to join the team.
	   The Bougainville conflict had been the longest war in the
Pacific since World War II before a cease-fire, brokered in part by
New Zealand, was signed Jan. 22.
	   The rebels initially took up arms in 1988 to protest
environmental damage caused by a part-Australian owned copper mine
and wring concessions from the Papua New Guinea government.
	   The mine was shut down by sabotage and the fighting evolved into
a campaign for independence. At least 20,000 people were killed and
up to 40,000 forced from their homes.
	   Truce-monitoring troops from New Zealand, Australia, Fiji and
Vanuatu, have been on Bougainville since early December.
	   The United Nations sent the observers to chair a committee on
the peace process and monitor the 300-strong regional peacekeeping
operation.

Doctors say DiMaggio a `tough guy'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo MH102 &QL; 
 &UR; By RACHEL LA CORTE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HOLLYWOOD, Florida (AP) _ Joe DiMaggio is a ``tough guy,''
showing his doctors a remarkable ability to fight back from several
serious setbacks since lung cancer surgery.
	   And most patients his age wouldn't have survived what the
84-year-old Hall of Famer has gone through, his doctor said.
	   DiMaggio, who rebounded from a fever and low white blood cell
count this weekend, was still on a respirator Wednesday at Memorial
Regional Hospital.
	   Dr. Earl Barron, who heads the team treating DiMaggio, said his
prognosis is guarded and his condition is stable. The next hope is
to get DiMaggio to breathe on his own.
	   ``If we get him off the respirator, we will then transfer him to
a rehabilitation floor and get him back on his feet,'' Barron said.
	   DiMaggio, who had a cancerous tumor removed from his right lung
Oct. 14, is fighting pneumonia in his left lung and an intestinal
infection. When his fever shot up over the weekend, doctors told
relatives and friends the former New York Yankees center fielder
might not make it.
	   Doctors even discussed having the family sign a ``do not
resuscitate'' form.
	   His improvement began after doctors inserted a tube into
DiMaggio's trachea on Monday to suction the infected area.
	   ``We're dealing with a man 84 years old,'' Barron said. ``The
greater percentage of patients that age who had gone through what
he's gone through probably would not have survived at this point.
But he's a tough guy.''
	   Barron sought to clarify what he called misinformation being
reported about DiMaggio's condition.
	   ``I'm not saying he's going to survive but he's certainly not
imminently dying,'' he said.
	   Friends and family know that the most recent upturn should not
cloud DiMaggio's overall health picture.
	   ``He's still in a lot of trouble,'' DiMaggio's friend and lawyer
Morris Engelberg said Tuesday. ``I'm worn out. I can't get excited
by any good news.''
	   Barron said it's impossible to predict how long DiMaggio will
remain in the hospital, and he said the family is holding up well,
considering the circumstances.
	   ``When you're dealing with a person you love, there's setbacks
and there's good times,'' Barron said. ``It's really hard to come
down from the highs and back up from the lows each time.''
	   Barron said DiMaggio's level of consciousness was down because
he was sedated.
	   ``We keep him sedated because it's a very anxiety-provoking
situation for anyone and here's a man who's not used to being
confined,'' he said. ``The sedation gives him time to rest and
hopefully to heal.''
	   DiMaggio entered the hospital just north of Miami on Oct. 12.
	   Since his surgery, he has had recurring pneumonia in his left
lung. Besides treatment with three antibiotics, he also has had
fluid drained from his lungs several times. His blood pressure
dropped so rapidly Nov. 16 that a Catholic priest was summoned to
administer last rites.

Report: Thai firms charge corruption in bidding on school equipment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Seven Thai companies have charged that
the bidding to supply a local university with dlrs 13.8 million
worth of science equipment was rigged, local papers reported on
Thursday.
	   The purchase of the equipment by the Ministry of Education was
funded with money from a dlrs 64 million World Bank loan to
Thailand, the Bangkok Post reported.
	   The allegations are the latest in a series of corruption
scandals that have plagued the Thai government and bureaucracy.
Recently, the minister of health and one of his deputies were
forced to resign over a similar price-fixing scam.
	   The seven companies that lost in the bidding said the winners
were awarded contracts despite quoting the highest prices for the
equipment, which is being supplied to the Rajabhat Institute, a
teacher's college, according to the Post.
	   They said the ministry would end up paying 50 million baht (dlrs
1.3 million) more than it should.
	   The losing companies said they lodged a complaint with the
Education Ministry, but an official at Rajabhat told the Post the
results had been approved by the World Bank and would not be
reviewed.
	   Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai has said that the rapid-fire
succession of corruption cases has eroded the popularity of his
government.
	   Chuan has a reputation as an honest politician, and as recently
as this week, he publicly vowed to fight graft and spare no one, no
matter what their position, involved in purloining public funds.
	   His governing coalition, however, contains some ministers with
less than savory reputations, and corruption has long been
acknowledged as being entrenched in the bureaucracy.
	   The Education Ministry, which after the military receives the
lion's share of the government's budget, has in the past been
headed by some politicians regarded as cronies of their prime
ministers. It has never been headed by an educator.

Two Korean arms dealers convicted of obtaining military secrets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Two South Korean arms dealers were
sentenced to up to one year in prison Thursday for obtaining
classified information on the nation's arms procurement programs.
	   A three-judge panel at the Seoul District Criminal Court gave a
one-year sentence to Kim Jang-hwan, 51, and a suspended 10-month
term to Shin Dong-yoon, 56.
	   The two were found guilty of obtaining classified information on
South Korea's plans to buy spy planes, jet fighters, missiles and
other modern weapons.
	   Four South Korean colonels also have been arrested in the case
and are being court-martialed, Defense Ministry officials said.
	   The two arms dealers passed the information to their U.S.-based
business partner, Linda Kim, 41, between February 1997 and last
March.
	   Linda Kim, who was not arrested, serves as a consultant for
E-Systems Inc. of Plano, Texas, prosecutors said.
	   South Korea is a major buyer of U.S. arms. It plans to spend
dlrs 33.6 billion on new weapons through 2004.

Bougainville leaders to set up reconciliation government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Leaders on the island of
Bougainville, which endured a 10-year secessionist civil war, have
agreed to set up their own reconciliation government, a report said
Thursday.
	   The Bougainville conflict had been the longest war in the
Pacific since World War II before a cease-fire, brokered in part by
New Zealand, was signed Jan. 22.
	   The new agreement to set up the Bougainville Peoples' Congress
on Dec. 31 was made between the current provincial island
government and Bougainville rebels, The National newspaper said.
	   The move to set up the congress comes despite the Papua New
Guinea national government's warning against it.
	   Bougainville leaders had said they would set up their own
reconciliation government after the national Parliament failed to
pass constitutional and provincial government amendments that would
have set up such a government.
	   After the failure of the legislation to pass through Parliament
earlier this month, Bougainville rebel leader Joseph Kabui said
Bougainvilleans would set up their own reconciliation government
whether or not it was illegal and unconstitutional.
	   Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Bill Skate warned such against
such a move, saying it was not possible to go against the
constitution.
	   A legally constituted interim Bougainville Reconciliation
government was to have been set up on Jan. 1 to take over from the
current island provincial Bougainville Transitional government,
which expires Dec. 31.
	   The rebels initially took up arms in 1988 to protest
environmental damage caused by a part-Australian owned copper mine
and wring concessions from the Papua New Guinea government.
	   The mine was shut down by sabotage and the fighting evolved into
a campaign for independence. At least 20,000 people were killed and
up to 40,000 forced from their homes.
	   Truce-monitoring troops from New Zealand, Australia, Fiji and
Vanuatu, have been on Bougainville since early December.

Kida brings pride, humility, humor from Japan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARRY ATKINS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ If his fastball is as quick as his wit, Japanese
right-hander Masao Kida may prove to be a real find for the Detroit
Tigers.
	   Dressed in the formal kimono of the samurai, Kida wowed
reporters with a great sense of humor during his introductory news
conference Wednesday with the Tigers.
	   Kida, 30, who has a 96-mph (154-kmph) fastball, signed a
two-year contract worth dlrs 3 million during the news conference.
After that, it was time to get acquainted.
	   Speaking through an interpreter, Kida told the reporters _ about
three-quarters of them from the Japanese media _ what he had been
doing since arriving in Detroit two days earlier. Clearly, he was
up on his American culture.
	   ``The first night, I went out for Japanese food,'' Kida said.
``But I was disappointed I couldn't meet Robo Cop.''
	   Tigers general manager Randy Smith, who made a 25-hour
round-trip flight to Japan to woo him just before Thanksgiving, was
full of praise for Kida. Smith said he was most impressed with
Kida's poise and intelligence.
	   Kida, a 6-foot-3 (1.88-meter), 210-pounder (95-kg) who played
last season for the Orix Blue Wave of the Japanese Pacific League,
compiled a 54-64 record with a 3.81 ERA in 10 seasons in the
Japanese leagues _ all but one with the Yomiuri Giants of the
Central League.
	   Last season, Kida began as a starter but was switched to the
bullpen on Aug. 7. After that, he was one of the league's most
effective relievers, earning 16 saves _ third-most in the league _
with a 1.38 ERA and a 1-1 record in 22 games.
	   Including his starts, Kida was 4-7 with a 4.72 ERA overall last
season.
	   Because the Tigers already have Todd Jones and Doug Brocail in
the bullpen, they will probably give Kida a chance to make the
rotation in spring training.
	   ``The one thing that impressed me was that he has experience
both as a starter and as a reliever,'' Smith said. ``Plus, his
size, and the fact that he has three good pitches he can throw for
strikes. All of those are pluses.''
	   Kida's signing highlights the trend of major league teams
turning to Japan to find new talent.
	   Japanese pitchers now in the majors include Hideki Irabu of the
New York Yankees, Hideo Nomo and Masato Yoshii of the New York Mets
and Shigetoshi Hasegawa of the Anaheim Angels. Kida said he was
grateful to those players for blazing the trail to America.
	   Still, this will be the longest Kida has ever been away from
Japan. Isn't he concerned that he might get homesick?
	   ``Well, I think I can get rid of that worry, if I can find a
nice girlfriend over here,'' Kida said with a smile. ``Please make
it known that I am single.''
	   Kida is the second free agent the Tigers have signed since the
end of the 1998 season. Earlier, they signed third baseman Dean
Palmer to a five-year, dlrs 36 million contract.
	   Smith still hopes to sign a catcher _ perhaps Bill Haselman who
hit .314 in 40 games for Texas last season as the backup to Ivan
Rodriguez.

Canseco signs with Devil Rays
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Florida (AP) _ Jose Canseco and the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays feel they're a perfect match.
	   The free agent outfielder likes the idea of playing closer to
his home in Miami, and the weak-hitting American League team likes
the power he figures to bring to the middle of its lineup.
	   Canseco, 34, agreed to terms Wednesday with the second-year
club, filling the need for a right-handed batter capable of taking
advantage of hitter-friendly Tropicana Field.
	   Contract figures were not announced.
	   The Devil Rays hit a major league-low 111 homers during their
inaugural season, while Canseco hit a career-high 46 for the
Toronto Blue Jays.
	   Six of Canseco's homers came against Tampa Bay, which got a
total of 33 homers from their most productive right-handed batters
_ Bubba Trammell (12), Bobby Smith (11) and Mike Kelly (10).
	   Canseco, who hit .237 with 107 RBIs and 29 stolen bases in 1998,
reportedly sought a three- or four-year deal worth more than dlrs 6
million per season to return to the Blue Jays.
	   Toronto only offered a one-year deal for dlrs 3 million. He
rejected the proposal, and agent Juan Iglesias began discussion
with the Devil Rays, who were high on Canseco's preferred list of
destinations because Tampa Bay is close to his home.
	   Tampa Bay general manager Chuck LaMar was unavailable for
comment. The team intends to formally announce the signing at a
news conference Thursday.
	   The left-handed hitting Paul Sorrento made 83 of his 126 starts
at designated hitter last season, and hit 17 homers _ two behind
team leader Fred McGriff, another lefty.
	   Although Canseco made it clear during negotiations that he hoped
to join the Devil Rays as an everyday outfielder, Tampa Bay is
expected to use him primarily as a DH because of his below-average
defensive skills.
	   Canseco is a .269 career hitter with 397 home runs and 1,214
RBIs in 14 seasons with the Blue Jays, Oakland Athletics, Texas
Rangers and Boston Red Sox.

Court finds Nomura manipulated Australian stock market
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Adds 3 grafs at end with `no comment' from Nomura's Tokyo
headquarters. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The Federal Court found Thursday that
investment house Nomura International Plc. manipulated the
Australian stock market by creating a ``false and misleading
appearance'' of active trading in a series of trades in March 1996.
	   On the day in question, the Japanese investment giant off-loaded
587 million Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 364 million) worth of
securities, selling in large parcels in the last few minutes of
trading and allowing some 12,900 futures contracts to expire.
	   Justice Ronald Sackville upheld allegations by the Australian
Securities and Investments Commission that Nomura knew its actions
would cause a fall in both the benchmark All Ordinaries Index, the
nation's basic stock market indicator, and the March share price
index (SPI).
	   Sackville said Nomura's actions on March 29, 1996, had
contravened both the Corporations Law and the Trade Practices Act.
	   He said the series of transactions made by Nomura, including the
creation of a bid basket for all securities in the benchmark all
ordinaries index at 5 to 20 percent below the previous day's
trading price, gave a false and misleading appearance of active
trading on the ASX in illiquid securities.
	   ``It also engaged in conduct intended to create a false or
misleading appearance with respect to the price of the illiquid
securities held by it on the same day,'' he said.
	   Sackville said Nomura knew that its actions would cause a fall
in the closing level of the all ords and the expiry price of SPI
contracts.
	   He also found that Nomura's creation of the bid basket was part
of its plan to lower the price of illiquid stocks at the close of
trading by engaging in ``self-trades at depressed prices.''
	   Nomura had traded with itself in respect to two securities and
was only saved from carrying out more such transactions by the
failure of various brokerages to fully carry out orders, he said.
	   The March sale orders were instructions given by Nomura to 10
separate brokers, requiring them to sell Nomura's basket of
securities very aggressively near the close of trading.
	   Sackville adjourned the matter to Dec. 18 when parties can make
submissions on any final orders.
	   Nomura International Plc., based in Sydney, is the wholly owned
Australian subsidiary of Nomura Securities Co., said Atsuko Toda, a
spokeswoman at Nomura headquarters in Tokyo.
	   Toda said the Tokyo office had yet to receive the contents of
the Federal Court's judgment and that local Nomura officials in
Australia were still examining the court papers.
	   ``We are not in a situation to comment right now,'' she said.

Three killed, dozens injured in Thai protest against power plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Three people were killed and dozens
injured and arrested when demonstrators and police clashed over the
building of three power plants in southern Thailand, local media
reported on Thursday.
	   Violence erupted Wednesday night when a force of 3,000 police
attempted to dislodge more than 5,000 demonstrators who had set up
road blocks on the Phet Kasem highway, the main road linking
Bangkok with the south.
	   Jor Sor Roi Radio and Daily News, a Thai-language daily,
reported that three people were killed, and the Bangkok Post said
50 protestors and 15 police were injured and taken to local
hospitals.
	   The battle was just one of several that have broken out in
recent years between police and members of communities opposed to
dams, power plants or other development projects in their areas.
	   More than 15,000 farmers and villagers descended on Government
House in Bangkok last year to protest that many development
projects were destroying their land and way of life while only
enriching the country's elite and wealthy businessmen.
	   The three power plants that ignited the current protest are
planned for Prachuab Khiri Khan, 230 kilometers (145 miles)
southwest of Bangkok, a port and industrial center.
	   They all use lignite, or brown coal, as their power source. The
demonstrators say that lignite is a major pollutant of the air and
water, and have cited as evidence the environmental havoc wreaked
by a lignite power plant in the northern Thai town of Mae Moh.
	   Mae Moh villagers attribute abnormally high rates of cancer,
lung diseases, birth defects and the poisoning of their soil and
water to residue from the lignite power plant.
	   The demonstrators in Prachuab Khiri Khan originally gathered in
front of the provincial hall on Tuesday where they burned an effigy
of Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai.
	   On Wednesday, having received no response from provincial
authorities, they decided to block the highway, stalling traffic
for six hours. Police were mobilized from several provinces to
force them off the road, the Post reported.
	   The demonstrators sent a delegation of four Buddhist monks to
ask the police to let the protest continue and not use force, but
their entreaties failed, the Post reported.
	   Police said trouble broke out at 7 p.m. (1200 GMT) when
demonstrators began destroying several cars belonging to stranded
motorists.
	   Officers then mounted a baton charge and drove trucks into the
crowd as a battering rams, the paper said. Demonstrators fought
back by throwing stones.
	   The protesters said they had been complaining to various
governments since 1996 that the community was strongly opposed to
lignite power plants in their area, but they have consistently been
ignored.

U.S. congressman flies to disputed Spratly Islands
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher
flew Thursday on a Philippine air force plane to the disputed
Spratly Islands in the South China Sea to observe structures being
built by China that Philippine officials say could be used for
military purposes.
	   Rohrabacher, accompanied by U.S. Embassy officials and Roilo
Golez, chairman of the Philippine House defense committee, said the
trip would help the U.S. Congress assess tensions in the South
China Sea.
	   Last month, Manila lodged a diplomatic protest with Beijing
after Chinese workers began enlarging buildings erected at Mischief
Reef in the Spratlys. Both countries claim the reef.
	   China says the concrete structures are shelters for fishermen,
but the Philippines says they could have military uses.
	   ``The fortification and intimidation by the Communist Chinese in
the Spratlys only shows they are bullying the democratic
Philippines,'' Rohrabacher said before boarding the C-130 plane.
	   ``We will make sure to meet the challenges and intimidation,''
the California Republican said.
	   The Chinese Embassy in Manila said without elaborating that it
is opposed to Rohrabacher's trip.
	   The trip to the Spratlys would be the first in recent years by
an official from a country not a party to the conflicting claims to
the territory.
	   The Spratlys, which straddle vital sea lanes in the South China
Sea, are claimed in whole by China, Vietnam and Taiwan, and in part
by Malaysia and the Philippines. Brunei claims one reef.
	   Mischief Reef, called Panganiban by the Philippines, is about
150 miles (240 kilometers) west of the western Philippine island of
Palawan.
	   Philippine Sen. Rodolfo Biazon, who heads the Senate committee
on national defense, criticized the trip, saying it could heighten
tension in the Spratlys, which many describe as a potential trouble
spot in Asia.
	   Aside from their strategic location, the Spratlys also are
believed to be sitting atop large deposits of oil and natural gas.

Jail uprising leaves 10 dead, 51 injured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ An uprising at a remote prison in the
Amazon jungle has left at least 10 inmates dead and 51 injured,
officials said.
	   Nine guards also were injured Wednesday when they tried to
restore order at El Dorado prison, located near the Brazil border
and 730 kilometers (440 miles) southeast of Caracas.
	   Justice Minister Hilarion Cardozo said the violence broke out
during a protest by inmates angry over tightened security measures
imposed after the recent escape of four prisoners.
	   Other authorities said guards opened fire when the prisoners
tried to set parts of the jail on fire during the protest.
	   El Dorado is one of the most violent jails in a prison system
described by U.S.-based Human Rights Watch as one of the worst in
the world. Some of Venezuela's most violent prisoners are sent to
El Dorado partly as punishment.
	   Last year, 325 inmates were killed in Venezuela's prisons, where
nearly three-fourths of prisoners have never been tried because of
a badly backlogged court system.

	   Morantes' goal came at 89 minutes in a game played by the two
Colombian squads on a poor quality field in which the goalkeepers
were rarely tested.
	   Atletico Nacional, of Medellin, had won the first game of the
playoff 3-1.
	   The Medellin team has been eliminated from Colombia's club
tournament but Deportivo Cali is still a contender and its coach,
Jose Hernandez, placed less importance on the Merconorte cup.
	   Hernandez kept many of his usual starters on the bench
Wednesday, saving them for the national tournament.
	   Wednesday night's victory, played before 7,000 fans, came nine
years after Atletico Nacional won the Libertadores de America cup.
	   Lineups:
	   DEPORTIVO CALI: Juan Carlos Mendoza; Freddy Hurtado, Manuel
Valencia, Andres Hurtado, Edwin Rivas; Omar Rogeiro, Felipe Arce,
Jairo Patino, Alexander Viveros; Max Torres y Jorge Diaz (Braham
Castillo, 70 minutes).
	   ATLETICO NACIONAL: Miguel Calero; Victor Marulanda, Ever
Palacios, Leiner Orejuela, Francisco Mosquera; Pedro Alvarez, Dumar
Rueda, Juan Guillermo Villa (Robinson Martinez, 65 minutes), Neider
Morantes; Carlos Vasquez (Daladier Ceballos, 46 minutes), Jailer
Moreno (Leon Dario Munoz, 88 minutes).
	   Referee: Oscar Julian Ruiz, Colombia.

Hooligan-free zone, mascot abuse, cash flow problems at Asian

Games &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ To ensure soccer hooliganism doesn't
mar the Asian Games, only ticket holders will be allowed to enter
one of the major sports complexes during soccer games _ especially
when Thailand is playing.
	   Thus far, football competition has proceeded with few problems,
although players from Thailand and Qatar exchanged punches and
kicks in a ``friendly'' pre-games match.
	   But just to be sure, organizers will be barring non-ticket
holders from the Hua Mark Sports Complex, where soccer events are
being staged at the Rajamangala National Stadium.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MASCOT ABUSE: The elephant mascot of the Asian Games,
``Chai-yo,'' is being cuddled by fans and held high by medal
winners at the victory podiums.
	   But off the playing fields, it's a far different story for the
real thing. Thailand's prime icon, the elephant, is being sorely
abused as it lumbers closer to extinction.
	   Its numbers have plunged from as many as 300,000 at the turn of
the century to at best 3,000 domesticated animals and some 1,400 in
the wild.
	   Once invaluable in transport and forest logging, domesticated
elephants and their keepers struggle to find jobs, sometimes ending
up begging in the polluted streets of Bangkok.
	   Others slave for illegal loggers, who feed them amphetamines and
sometimes hack at them with knives to keep them working. Wild
elephants are poached and confined to increasingly smaller areas.
	   Meanwhile at the Asian Games, stuffed ``Chai-yos'' are being
sold by the thousands, and each medal winner gets one as a
souvenir.
	   ``To people in Asia, this loving creature has been so helpful
that it has become a symbol of tender respect and proud prestige,''
says a public relations release from the organizers.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ROYAL RAM: An upcountry man has been charged with reckless
driving and tested for alcohol after the van he was driving rammed
into a limousine carrying Japan's Prince Tomohito, police said
Thursday.
	   Thailand's top police officer, Gen. Pracha Promnok, went to
apologize to the prince, a cousin of Emperor Akihito, after the
accident Wednesday.
	   According to police spokesman Maj. Gen. Chatchawan Suksomjit,
the van driver hit the front right-hand side of the limousine as it
was heading out of an expressway toll plaza.
	   There were no injuries and damage to the prince's limousine was
reportedly minor.
	   The accident occurred as the prince was being driven in a
police-escorted motorcade from a downtown hotel to an Asian Games
sports venue.
	   Chatchawan said the van driver, Cherdchai Pimpakham, 27, of
Kalasin province, was booked for reckless driving. Police were
awaiting results of an alcohol level test.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NO ASIAN CRISIS AT ASIAN GAMES: Asia's economic crisis doesn't
appear to have stopped fans from digging into their pocketbooks:
organizers say ticket sales are already 10 million baht (dlrs
278,000) ahead of target.
	   Sales have been especially brisk for soccer, volleyball,
basketball and badminton.
	   Keattisak Wongpanich, an official with the ticketing committee,
says students are flocking to the stadiums rather than taking
advantage of a two-week holiday during the games to travel out of
town.
	   ``It does not appear as though the current economic problems
being experienced in Thailand and throughout the region have
affected ticket sales,'' Keattisak said.
	   Free entry to a number of sports competition is also helping to
fill stadiums, while students are being offered tickets for as
little as 10 baht (28 U.S. cents).
	   ___ &QC; 
	   INTERNET OVERLOAD: The Asian Games official home page on the
Internet has taken more than 1 million hits, forcing organizers to
add a fourth server.
	   ``We added one more server after we found out that the ones we
provided were not enough,'' said Suphachai Chongsiri, chairman of
the games' information technology sub-committee.
	   The official website _ www.asiangames.th _ provides results of
competition as well as information on schedules, venues,
participating countries and Asian Games sports.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   CASH FLOW: The good news for Thailand is that its athletes are
winning medals at the Asian Game in greater than expected numbers.
	   The bad news is that the cash-strapped Thai government will have
to shell out more bonus money to winners than was anticipated. It
forked over a first slice of 9 million baht (dlrs 250,000)
Wednesday.
	   Hoping to improve on its miserly medal haul at the last Asian
Games in 1994, the government agreed to pay 1 million baht (dlrs
27,778) to each gold medal winner. Silver medalists will receive
300,000 baht (dlrs 8,333) and winners of bronze medals collect
200,000 baht (dlrs 5,556).
	   Thailand's tally for the first four days is already four golds,
seven silvers and 11 bronzes. And there are still 11 days to go.
	   While local fans will be cheering their soccer team, some
government officials might not prove as enthusiastic.
	   A gold medal in soccer would deplete the coffers by another 22
million baht (dlrs 611,111).

Winter bonuses of Japanese government employees rise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese government employees have something to
cheer about amid the country's severe recession: Their winter
bonuses, paid out Thursday, rose for the fourth year in a row.
	   The average bonus paid to central government employees was up
1.8 percent to 735,000 yen (dlrs 6,228) per worker from a year
earlier, the Management and Coordination Agency said.
	   The largest bonus payments of 6.97 million yen (dlrs 59,067)
went to Supreme Court Chief Justice Shigeru Yamaguchi, while Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi received 6.92 million yen (dlrs 58,644), the
second largest amount.
	   Satoshi Neriai, an official of the agency's Personnel Bureau,
said 4.49 million public workers, or 6.6 percent of Japan's total
wage-earners, were eligible for Thursday's bonuses.
	   In Japan, bonuses are considered part of both public and private
sector workers' salaries and a similar summer bonus is paid around
July or early August.
	   Neriai said the bonus payments for the government employees are
decided based on the previous year's actual payments by private
businesses.
	   The bonuses paid this winter by private companies fell 4.0
percent to 498,300 yen (dlrs 4,222) per worker, according to Sanwa
Research Institute, a major Japanese think tank.
	   It was the second consecutive year-on-year decline in winter
bonuses for private company workers after a 0.1 percent drop in
1997, the institute said.
	   Hit by Japan's worst recession in decades, many private
companies are implementing drastic restructuring measures,
including widespread layoffs.

School teacher rebuked for telling kids there is no Santa Claus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ A school teacher is in trouble
because she told her students that Santa Claus does not exist,
which sent some of them home in tears.
	   Angry parents complained and the local education minister, Bill
Stefaniak, a conservative politician who says he still believes in
Santa, agreed to take up their case.
	   He spoke to the headmaster at the Isabella Plains primary
school, who told the teacher, whom he would not name, that she
might have made an error of judgment.
	   But the teachers' union stuck up for the teacher, saying she
should be praised for speaking truthfully.
	   ``This is not as issue about a Christian belief in the
resurrection of Christ,'' Warren Lee, the local branch secretary of
the Australian Education Union said Thursday.
	   ``This is a story about a commercial fable.''
	   Stefaniak has no regrets.
	   ``There are lots of things that should not be discussed in
classrooms.'' Stefaniak added.
	   He is planning to tell all teachers in the territory's schools
exactly how they should respond to questions about Father Christmas
in future.

OCA blasts weightlifters after athlete tests positive for diuretic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Asia's top Olympic official has accused
weightlifting's governing body of not doing enough to combat doping
after a Jordanian lifter became the first Asian Games athlete to
test positive for drugs.
	   Jordanian weightlifter Ayed Khawaldeh was expelled from the
games after testing positive to triamterene, a diuretic which
athletes use to help them lose weight, allowing them to compete in
lower weight categories.
	   Khawaldeh, 25, admitted the offense at a meeting between Olympic
Council of Asia officials and the Jordanian team, the OCA said in a
statement announcing his disqualification.
	   ``The weightlifter stated that he used that substance while he
was on a three-week training camp, knowing that it was a
diuretic,'' the OCA said.
	   Khawaldeh has been expelled from the athletes' village, had his
results voided and will face a two-year ban from the International
Weightlifting Federation. The OCA also said it had sent a ``strong
warning'' to the Jordanian Olympic Committee because of the test
result.
	   But Jordan's team doctor said he hoped Khawaldeh would escape
with a caution. He said Khawaldeh had not known that the drug,
which he took in Turkey while preparing for the Games, was banned
and he was not trying to cheat.
	   ``He thought it was a simple drug like paracetemol,'' Dr.
Mohammad Abu-Ain said Thursday. ``He's a simple guy, he didn't
know.''
	   After a midnight meeting to discuss the case, OCA president
Sheikh Ahmad Al-Sabah criticized the International Weightlifting
Federation for not doing enough to educate its members about drugs.
He noted that an Egyptian lifter also failed a recent drugs test.
	   ``Weightlifting is facing a very big problem with doping in
their sport, and they have a very big war against doping,'' Sheikh
Ahmad told The Associated Press. He said the International
Federation for Weightlifting was not doing enough to educate their
competitors about drugs.
	   The drug helped Khawaldeh lose weight to compete in the
56-kilogram class on Monday. He placed seventh, so was caught in a
random test.
	   The OCA said his usual body weight is 60 kilograms but he
weighed in at 55.8 kilograms on the day of competition.
	   Sheikh Ahmad said he was ``really surprised'' by the positive
result because Khawaldeh had not been expected to contend for
medals.
	   ``I'm still crossing my fingers that it will be the only case
because in Hiroshima we had, as everybody knows, 11 cases,'' he
said. ``If we have one, maximum two, cases this will be very useful
for the movement in this continent and will show we are solving the
problem.''
	   Eleven Chinese team members returned positive tests at the
previous games in 1994 but the results were not made public until
after the event.
	   OCA medical committee chairman Yoshio Kuroda said the organizers
had spent about dlrs 4.5 million on the drug fight here.
	   ``This time we have very good technology and very good
equipment,'' Kuroda said.
	   All drug tests at the games are being carried out with the most
sophisticated tool available, a half-million-dollar piece of
equipment called a carbon isotope ratio mass spectrometer.
	   The technology was first used at the Winter Olympics in Nagano,
Japan, earlier this year but for only one in every five drug tests.

<TEXT>
	   CALI, Colombia (AP) _ Midfielder Neider Morantes scored off a
well-placed centering pass from Leon Dario Munoz on Wednesday to
give Atletico Nacional a 1-0 victory over Deportivo Cali and the
Merconorte cup championship.
	   Morantes' goal came at 89 minutes in a game played by the two
Colombian squads on a poor quality field in which the goalkeepers
were rarely tested.
	   Atletico Nacional, of Medellin, had won the first game of the
playoff 3-1.
	   It was the first year for the Merconorte tournament, in which
teams from Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela participated.
	   The Medellin team has been eliminated from Colombia's club
tournament but Deportivo Cali is still a contender and its coach,
Jose Hernandez, placed less importance on the Merconorte cup.
	   Hernandez kept many of his usual starters on the bench
Wednesday, saving them for the national tournament.
	   Wednesday night's victory, played before 7,000 fans, came nine
years after Atletico Nacional won the Libertadores de America cup.
	   Lineups:
	   DEPORTIVO CALI: Juan Carlos Mendoza; Freddy Hurtado, Manuel
Valencia, Andres Hurtado, Edwin Rivas; Omar Rogeiro, Felipe Arce,
Jairo Patino, Alexander Viveros; Max Torres y Jorge Diaz (Braham
Castillo, 70 minutes).
	   ATLETICO NACIONAL: Miguel Calero; Victor Marulanda, Ever
Palacios, Leiner Orejuela, Francisco Mosquera; Pedro Alvarez, Dumar
Rueda, Juan Guillermo Villa (Robinson Martinez, 65 minutes), Neider
Morantes; Carlos Vasquez (Daladier Ceballos, 46 minutes), Jailer
Moreno (Leon Dario Munoz, 88 minutes).

Royal Melbourne perfect locale for Presidents Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DENNIS PASSA
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Tiger Woods didn't waste any time
showing why Royal Melbourne is a made-to-order course for the
match-play format of this week's Presidents Cup.
	   Woods was starting a practice round with three American
teammates when he pulled out a driver and jettisoned a shot over
the left-side trees, cutting off the dogleg on the par-4, 324-meter
(354-yard) opening hole.
	   The ball pitched 20 meters short of the green, rolled on to the
putting surface, hit the edge of the cup and rolled 20 feet past.
	   ``If the pin was in, there was every chance it would have gone
in,'' said teammate Mark Calcavecchia, who was putting out with
David Duval when Woods' ball rolled through the green.
	   Woods, who declined to say whether he'd sunk the putt for eagle,
had a good time doing that _ he might even try it during the
matches that start Friday. But some of the other golfers here this
week think the fun will begin on the greens.
	   ``The putting is going to be such a key this week, and that's
what makes is such a great match-play course,'' said Zimbabwe's
Nick Price.
	   ``Depending on where the balls are positioned on the green, who
is going to be aggressive and who is going to be trying to
two-putt. I think for the fans who are out there and also for the
viewers on TV, they will get to understand where you don't want to
hit the ball.''
	   Royal Melbourne's composite course _ 12 holes from the West
(designed by Augusta National architect Alister Mackenzie) and 6
holes from the East _ has been the site of various championship
tournaments, the last being the 1996 Greg Norman Classic.
	   For the Presidents Cup, a rerouted par-72, 6,395-meter
(6,981-yard) layout using the same composite course has been mapped
out to have the golfers play the last few holes closer to the
clubhouse.
	   Phil Mickelson, who has played on the last two Presidents Cup
and Ryder Cup teams for the United States, agrees with Price that
putting will be the key.
	   ``The greens are playing a little faster, which is the way he
designed it to play,'' Mickelson said of Mackenzie's plans. ``It is
very similar to Augusta in that sense _ the character comes out in
the greens. There's not too much trouble to get into off the tee or
into the greens, but on and around the greens, we will see some
shots exchanged.''
	   Australian Craig Parry, who has played Royal Melbourne dozens of
times, says the course is in excellent shape, but warns golfers
that the greens aren't as fast as they might get.
	   ``I know they are not fast, because I know what they can get
like'' said Parry. ``But I think we're all going to enjoy it.''
	   Greg Norman, who will open the foursomes (alternating shot) with
teammate Steve Elkington against Americans Jim Furyk and John
Huston in one of five matches Friday morning, says the course is
playing perfect and rates it ``nine and a half out of 10.''
	   South Africa's Ernie Els, who played a practice round with
Parry, says that some of the three par-5s on the course _
particularly the 2nd _ will be reachable in two shots, also making
it a good match-play course.
	   ``So an eagle or three is a possibility,'' said Els.
	   ``It's such a great golf course, but you need to know where to
position yourself. You can't really go out there and just keep on
pounding a driver all over the place.''
	   Obviously, Tiger Woods doesn't feel the same way. (djp)

Whitney's goal lifts Panthers over Senators
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SUNRISE, Florida (AP) _ Ray Whitney scored Florida's fifth
power-play goal of the game, breaking a tie with 5:29 left
Wednesday night and giving the Florida Panthers a 6-5 victory over
the Ottawa Senators.
	   The Panthers took a 4-0 lead in the first period, and led 5-3
entering the third period. But Senators rookie Marian Hossa scored
his first NHL goal and then assisted on a breakaway goal by Radek
Bonk, tying it at 5 with 8:17 left.
	   Hossa was penalized for tripping with 6:10 remaining. Panthers
goaltender Sean Burke passed to Robert Svehla, who fed a streaking
Whitney for the breakaway goal that beat Ron Tugnutt.
	   Whitney also had two assists as Florida beat the Senators for
the first time in eight games (1-5-2).
 &UR; Avalanche 2, Rangers 1
	   In New York, Joe Sakic and Peter Forsberg scored within a
98-second span of the third period, lifting the Colorado Avalanche
over the New York Rangers in a battle of surging teams.
	   The Avalanche, who had trailed since the 1:29 mark of the second
period when Mathieu Schneider scored for New York, won their fifth
straight while stopping a five-game winning streak for the Rangers.
	   The Avalanche continued a climb toward the top of their
Northwest Division with a 13-7-1 record following an 0-4-1 start,
the worst in franchise history.
 &UR; Stars 3, Sharks 3
	   In Dallas, Darryl Sydor had a goal and two assists to help the
Dallas Stars rally from a two-goal, first-period deficit for a tie
with the San Jose Sharks.
	   Tony Hrkac's power-play goal late in the second period capped
Dallas' comeback, drawing the Stars even at 3. Sydor and Jere
Lehtinen also scored with the man advantage for the Stars, 4-1-1 in
their last six games and 9-2-2 at home this season.
	   Goals from Patrick Marleau, Owen Nolan and Mike Ricci put San
Jose ahead 3-1 in the first period before the Stars rallied.
 &UR; Blackhawks 3, Oilers 1
	   In Chicago, Eric Daze scored two goals and Jocelyn Thibault made
24 saves, allowing just a fluke score that deflected off a teammate
as the Chicago Blackhawks beat the Edmonton Oilers.
	   The victory was the fourth in five games for the Blackhawks.
Edmonton's season-longest winless streak was stretched to four
games (0-3-1).
