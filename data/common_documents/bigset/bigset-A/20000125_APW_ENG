<P>
    SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Karl Malone scored 31 points and John Stockton had 18
points, 15 assists and nine rebounds as the Utah Jazz outlasted the Los Angeles
Lakers 105-101 in double overtime Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Quincy Lewis scored six points in the second overtime and Stockton added
four as the Jazz sent the Lakers to their fourth loss in the last six games.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff Hornacek, the NBA's top free throw shooter who had missed the last
three games with knee and back strains, made two foul shots with 53 seconds left
to make it 99-95 and added two more with 7.9 seconds to play to make it 101-96.
</P>
<P>
	   Kobe Bryant made a long 3-pointer to cut it to 103-101 but Lewis sank two
more free throws and the Jazz escaped with their fifth win in six games.
</P>
<P>
	   Shaquille O'Neal lead all scorers with 36 points and played 55 minutes but
scored just four points after regulation. Bryant had 26 points on 9-of-24
shooting and Glen Rice added 20 for Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   The teams traded baskets through most of the first overtime before Stockton
hit a 3-pointer with 34 seconds left to put Utah up 91-89.
</P>
<P>
	   Bryant missed a shot but Rice rebounded and hit a turnaround jumper to tie
it again. Malone missed a 3-pointer at the buzzer to force another overtime.
</P>
<P>
	   Stockton, who has never had a triple-double in his 16 seasons, matched his
career high in rebounds with nine and played a season-high 47 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jazz trailed 72-70 when Malone began delivering for the Jazz. Malone
outscored the Lakers 9-4 with an array of jumpers and a free throw to give Utah
a 79-76 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Stockton made it 81-77 with a baseline jumper but in the last minute both
Malone and Stockton committed turnovers while Bryant and Rice hit jump shots to
tie the game. Rice had a chance to win it at the buzzer but missed a leaning
14-foot jumper.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neal scored the Lakers first 10 points of the second half and made a layup
to give Los Angeles a 61-60 lead with 2:28 left in the third.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neal went to the bench and the Jazz held the Lakers scoreless for the rest
of the quarter while hitting six free throws to take a 66-61 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Bryant sparked the Lakers with a breakaway reverse dunk during a 9-2 run to
open the fourth. Derek Fisher's baseline jumper knotted the game at 70 with 7:12
to play.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jazz took a 44-43 halftime lead behind Malone's 12 first-half points.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bush Win Iowa Caucuses  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Republican George W. Bush won Iowa's kickoff
caucuses Monday night, besting upstart Steve Forbes to set the stage for a
three-way presidential primary fight in New Hampshire. Democrats gave Al Gore a
thumping win over Bill Bradley who said he had ``a little more humility'' and
vowed to push his challenge.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I can't wait to get to New Hampshire,'' was Gore's battle cry and he said
he'd be campaigning Tuesday at dawn.
</P>
<P>
	   The results set the stage for a dramatic week in New Hampshire, first in a
furious flurry of primary elections that could determine the presidential
nominations by March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush described the caucus results as validation of his compassionate
conservative agenda. ``It's a solid victory and I'm humbled,'' he said as the
presidential campaigns put the best-possible spins on their finishes. The Texas
governor called his victory ``record-shattering'' and roused supporters with the
vow, ``tonight is the beginning of the end of the Clinton era.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes was at least as happy with the results, saying, ``We vastly
overperformed the polls and have emerged as the conservative candidate'' going
into New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes told AP that, ``we vastly overperformed the polls and have emerged as
the conservative candidate'' going into New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore outpolled Bradley 63 percent to 35 percent, and the former New Jersey
senator said, ``Tonight I have a little more humility but no less confidence
that I can win and do the job.''
</P>
<P>
	   Looking ahead to New Hampshire, Gore and Bradley were locked in a tie in
Granite state polls. Sen. John McCain of Arizona holds a slight lead over Bush
in most New Hampshire GOP polls, and he hoped to sustain it even after bypassing
Iowa. Forbes has been a distant third in New Hampshire, but hoped his Iowa
showing would improve his numbers.
</P>
<P>
	   With results from 95 percent of Iowa's counties, Bush had 41 percent of the
caucus vote and Forbes 30 percent. Former ambassador and talk show host Alan
Keyes was a respectable third at 14 percent, with Gary Bauer at 9 percent, John
McCain 5 and Orrin Hatch just 1 -- not even 900 votes.
</P>
<P>
	   Hatch planned a news conference Tuesday, and an adviser said he was likely
to drop out of the race. Bauer was said to be deeply disappointed and assessing
the future of his candidacy, but told 50 supporters he would forge on to New
Hampshire. ``I wasn't raised to be a quitter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush noted that the highest percentage achieved by a GOP victor in Iowa was
37.4, when Bob Dole beat Pat Robertson before stalling in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   The Iowa process will yield 47 delegates to the Democratic convention and 25
delegates to the GOP convention, a tiny fraction of the total a candidate needs
to win the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   AP's delegate count showed Gore with 29 and Bradley 18. Bush was likely to
earn 10 delegates, compared to eight for Forbes, four for Keyes, two for Bauer
and one for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes mounted, and funded, a particularly vigorous campaign here, calling
on fundamentalist and conservative support to challenge the more moderate Bush.
McCain passed up the contest to focus on more independent-oriented New
Hampshire. Keyes bested Bauer in their duel for GOP social activists, dealing
his rival a staggering blow.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's big margin blunted Bradley's challenge going into New Hampshire where
Bradley has polled even with Gore, or even ahead. In a sign of the tit-for-tat
to come, Gore accused Bradley of ``going negative'' in the final days of the
Iowa race -- and said the tactic backfired.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it was a mistake for his campagn to go to the so-called negative
approach but I'm not complaining,'' Gore said. ``But based on what I've heard
from from the voters out here they didn't expect that and didn't like it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley congratulated the vice president for his ``strong showing,'' giving
no hint of what aides say are plans to be more critical of Gore in coming days.
</P>
<P>
	   The caucuses were expected to draw no more than 100,000 voters from each
party, concluding a lengthy runup of debates, fund raising and grass-roots
campaigning here. Iowa launches the presidential race into a frantic six-week
stretch, with the New Hampshire primary a week away.
</P>
<P>
	   Iowans were attending caucuses across the sprawling state. In a display of
basic grass-roots politics, voters here brave the winter weather and visit
classrooms, libraries, fire stations, church basements, grain co-ops and even a
few private homes to play their unique role in the American political system.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush voters identified moral values and taxes as their top issues, and said
they voted for Bush because they believe he can win in November. Among Forbes
voters, the top issue was taxes and the top quality was that Forbes stands up
for what he believes in. These findings resulted from pre-caucus interviews
conducted by Voter News Service.
</P>
<P>
	   Enroute to the early contests, Republicans squabbled over taxes and
abortion, courting religious conservatives who make up a third of the
caucus-going population. Bush carefully calibrated his antiabortion views to
make clear his opposition to the Supreme Court ruling. Democrats were poised to
campaign on the issue if Bush were to win the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore and Bradley differed in tone more than substance. They wrestled
primarily over alternative approaches to federal health insurance policy. While
Bradley promised to provide big ideas to solve a few big problems. Gore said the
next president should not limit himself to a handful of issues.
</P>
<P>
	   After a ragged start, Gore led Bradley by more than 20 percentage points in
most pre-caucus polls. A string of setbacks, including recurrence of a minor
heart condition, threw Bradley off track in the final week.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Republican side, Bush's totals tracked his showing in pre-caucus
polls. Forbes did better than polling had suggested, siphoning off votes from
three others competing for the same pool of conservative votes. Entrance polls
showed that one third of voters who identified themselves as conservative
Christians supported Forbes, another third supported Bush and the remainder were
split among the other candidates.

<HEADLINE> Grief times three: Seton Hall fire victims mourned at funeral  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   LONG BRANCH, N.J. (AP) - The grief-stricken friends and family of three
Seton Hall University freshmen who died in a dormitory fire gathered to mourn
and wonder why.
<P>
	   But there were no answers. Not at St. Jerome Roman Catholic Church, where
Frank S. Caltabilota Jr. was remembered in a 90-minute Mass.
</P>
<P>
	   Not at St. Francis of Assisi in Vineland, where John Giunta was laid to
rest.
</P>
<P>
	   And not at St. John the Evangelist Roman Catholic Church in Dunellen, where
Aaron Karol was remembered as a "near-perfect kid."
</P>
<P>
	   "Today our faith cannot answer the question why," the Rev. William Sheridan,
assistant director of campus ministry at Seton Hall, told mourners in Vineland.
"Why did three die? Why did John die? Why?"
</P>
<P>
	   Caltabilota, of West Long Branch, was a three-sport standout at Shore
Regional High School who aspired to a career in medicine. An honor student, he
compared himself in his Seton Hall application essay to a basketball player who
chooses to pass to an open teammate instead of shooting the ball himself.
</P>
<P>
	   "My school counselor says that I am a natural caretaker. Maybe she's right,"
he wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 800 people filled St. Jerome for the service.
</P>
<P>
	   Caltabilota's girlfriend, Erin Brown, 18, had to pause several times during
a five-minute eulogy to gather herself. "You touched the lives of so many
people, even if you'd only known them five minutes," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Dunellen, about 450 people crowded into St. John the Evangelist Roman
Catholic Church to say goodbye to Karol, of Green Brook, a soccer enthusiast and
criminal justice major who hoped someday to work for the FBI.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was just an all-round, near-perfect kid," said Jimmy Byrnes, 17, a
soccer teammate at Watchung Hills Regional High School. "He had everything -
sports, popularity, smarts."
</P>
<P>
	   Weeping teen-agers carried the coffin down the aisle, followed by Karol's
family.
</P>
<P>
	   "Learn from the loss of this young man how precious life is," said the Rev.
John Morley, a Seton Hall priest. "And it does not come with guarantees."
</P>
<P>
	   ----
</P>
<P>
	   In Vineland, about 500 people - including three busloads of Seton Hall
students - turned out for Giunta's funeral Mass at St. Francis of Assisi Roman
Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
	   Giunta, an elementary education major who aspired to teaching in the inner
city, was remembered as a generous, loyal guy with a great future.
</P>
<P>
	   "He seemed like he had a dream ahead of him. He knew what he wanted to do,"
said John Henderson, 21, of Vineland, a high school classmate.
</P>
<P>
	   Classmates consoled each other, holding hands or patting one another on the
back.
</P>
<P>
	   "We say that Seton Hall is a family, and it is," said Seton Hall chancellor
Thomas Peterson, who spoke at Karol's funeral Mass. "We, like yourselves, have
lost a son."
</P>
<P>
	   There were prayers for the three elsewhere, too.
</P>
<P>
	   -In Rome, a group of American priests at the Vatican offered Mass for the
victims Monday, Morley said. One of the priests was a former Seton Hall faculty
member.
</P>
<P>
	   -In Washington, U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg read a resolution honoring the
three on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
	   -In Trenton, Gov. Christie Whitman departed from the prepared text of her
annual budget message to say, "We want the families to know they are in our
hearts and in our prayers."
</P>
<P>
	   At Seton Hall, meanwhile, some freshmen returned to their rooms at Boland
Hall for the first time since the fire.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents of the first two floors were allowed to move back into their
rooms, while third, fourth and fifth floor residents were relocated, university
officials said. The university banned media from the South Orange campus from
until a Tuesday memorial service.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire broke out around 4:30 a.m. Wednesday on the third floor of Boland
Hall, a six-story dormitory that housed 640 people. Five remained hospitalized
Monday, four in critical condition with burns.

<HEADLINE> Defense accuses police of "rushing to judgment" in 1973 slaying  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - Rather than wait to analyze all the crime-scene
evidence, police rushed ahead and charged a transvestite prostitute with killing
a businessman in 1973 on the basis of a coerced confession, a defense attorney
charged.
<P>
	   At the retrial of John Duval, 47, whose murder conviction was overturned
last spring after he'd spent 25 years in prison, attorney Reginald Towe pointed
out that authorities never presented any physical evidence against Duval at his
1973 trial.
</P>
<P>
	   "Police in the city of Rochester simply rushed to judgment in this matter
... before they had all the physical evidence analyzed," he said in opening
statements Monday. "They just simply didn't care."
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutor Joseph Curran promised to present jurors "credible evidence" that
Duval took part in the killing. "Free of any sympathy ... there will be but one
verdict," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A retired detective, Joseph Dominick, denied that he had ever threatened,
coerced or struck Duval during his 19 hours in custody, or saw anyone else do
so.
</P>
<P>
	   Duval and a fellow prostitute, Betty Tyson, got 25 years to life
imprisonment for the strangling of Timothy Haworth, a Philadelphia business
consultant who left his Rochester hotel late on May 24, 1973, apparently to look
for a prostitute.
</P>
<P>
	   They were convicted of murder on the basis of confessions they insist were
beaten out of them by a rogue detective, William Mahoney, and on the testimony
on two teen-age runaways, one of whom revealed in 1997 that he'd been terrorized
by Mahoney into lying.
</P>
<P>
	   The convictions were overturned after prosecutors then came upon a buried
synopsis of a police interview with the other teen-ager, Jon Jackson, in which
he denied seeing them with the victim - contrary to what he testified at trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Haworth, 52, was battered with a brick and asphyxiated with his necktie in
an alley. Police suspect the motive was robbery.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities found tire tracks near the body and rounded up prostitutes who
had cars. Only after Tyson and Duval were charged did they realize that her
car's tire treads didn't match.
</P>
<P>
	   Duval maintains that chief detective William Mahoney forced him to sign a
confession he later recanted. Mahoney, investigated at least 10 times for
allegedly abusing suspects, resigned in 1980 after fabricating evidence in an
unrelated case. He died in 1981.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors decided not to retry Tyson - the city gave her $1.2 million in
compensation - but went after Duval again. While Tyson had steadfastly
maintained her innocence, Duval had twice admitted his guilt before a parole
board.
</P>
<P>
	   Duval insists he lied because he didn't think he would be freed until he
admitted guilt.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani and Hillary Clinton visit state Capitol  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Their entourages in tow, expected Senate rivals
Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rudolph Giuliani missed each other by just a few
hours, but did manage to take swipes at each other in passing.
<P>
	   Gov. George Pataki and other Republican allies of the New York City mayor
accused Mrs. Clinton of trying to upstage the mayor on Monday as he made his
annual pilgrimage to Albany seeking more state aid for the city.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady arrived a couple of hours later to meet with Democratic
members of the state Legislature and mingle with gay rights activists.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no question in my mind that the first lady chose today to come
because she doesn't want people to hear the positive message of the successful
record of Mayor Giuliani," Pataki said at a news conference with the mayor by
his side.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady's camp denied any such motive and she said at a state Capitol
news conference that "at last count, I've been in upstate New York more than 30
times and I have never run into the mayor."
</P>
<P>
	   Patricia Lynch, a spokeswoman for state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver,
said the invitation from Silver to Mrs. Clinton went out "several months ago."
</P>
<P>
	   "One could say the governor's hastily staged news conference was in response
to her being here," Lynch huffed.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm just here working today at my full-time job being mayor of New York
City," Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm looking for political support," Mrs. Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a day for trading charges.
</P>
<P>
	   State Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, a Republican backer of the
mayor's expected Senate candidacy, repeatedly called Mrs. Clinton the "stranger
from Arkansas."
</P>
<P>
	   At a morning stop in Westchester County where she now lives, Mrs. Clinton
said the mayor's fund raising showed that if he were elected to the Senate he
would be "beholden to the far right of the Republican Party and fringe groups."
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani laughed.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're doing the right-wing conspiracy again? That's deja vu all over
again," the mayor responded.
</P>
<P>
	   Before President Clinton admitted to lying about his sexual relationship
with Monica Lewinsky, Mrs. Clinton had blamed a "vast, right-wing conspiracy"
for her husband's problems.
</P>
<P>
	   During an appearance before the state Legislature's budget committees,
Giuliani sought Monday to convince lawmakers that Pataki's latest $77 billion
state budget plan didn't do enough to help the city.
</P>
<P>
	   But unlike previous years, when Giuliani appeared almost confrontational
over what he saw as a shortchanging of the city by the state, the mayor opened
his testimony to lawmakers this year by praising "the very strong partnership
between the city and the state."
</P>
<P>
	   "Conditions in both the city of New York and the state of New York have
improved dramatically," the mayor told lawmakers at a public hearing on fellow
Republican Pataki's budget proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, at his news conference with Pataki, the mayor and governor seemed to
have developed a mutual admiration society.
</P>
<P>
	   "Let's keep this partnership and let's have it in Washington come the end of
this year," Pataki said at the end of their news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1994, Giuliani crossed party lines to endorse then-Gov. Mario Cuomo in
his unsuccessful bid for a fourth term against Pataki. Relations between the
Republican governor and the mayor have been frosty for most of the time since
then. They have warmed as Giuliani prepared to run against Mrs. Clinton.

New York for too much money to make amends for a bad land deal made 205 years
ago, says a state lawyer.
<P>
	   "This award should not be based on speculation, and, of course, it shouldn't
be based on sympathy," David R. Roberts said Monday as the historic land claim
damages trial began in U.S. District Court.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are asking you to do a factual, empirical, scientific study. It should
be a decision based on sound facts," Roberts told the nine-member jury.
</P>
<P>
	   An attorney for the Cayugas told jurors that the tribe should get at least
$335 million for its lost ancestral lands, money the tribe can use to pay for a
rebirth.
</P>
<P>
	   "The numbers involved in this case are very large, they are very
considerable. But they cover a substantial amount of land, they cover a
substantial period of time," attorney Martin R. Gold said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This case is about providing the Cayugas a sum that they can use to get
themselves started again. They could acquire land, they could build some
buildings ... They could make a home again," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury will determine how much money the Cayugas should receive for 64,015
acres - 100 square miles - of its former territory in Seneca and Cayuga
counties. Presiding U.S. District Judge Neal McCurn previously ruled that the
land was illegally acquired by New York state in 1795 and 1807 because the state
did not obtain the federal government's required approval for the transactions.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury will decide how much the Cayugas should be compensated for the
current market value of their lost lands as well as what rent they should be
paid for its occupancy and use over 205 years. It is the first of four pending
New York land claim cases to reach the damages phase.
</P>
<P>
	   McCurn has said the jury cannot award any land and that no present-day
property owners in the claim area would face eviction.
</P>
<P>
	   "To just kick everyone off and return the land to the Cayugas would be
trying to right an ancient wrong with a modern-day wrong," Gold told the jury,
although he said the tribe would use the money to buy land from willing sellers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cayugas, who once spread out over 3 million acres of upstate New York,
are the only landless tribe among the five aboriginal tribes of the Iroquois
Confederacy. Currently, about 500 Cayugas live in western New York on and around
the Seneca's Cattaraugus reservation. Two other groups of Cayugas live in Canada
and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys began by outlining the trial for the nine jurors.
</P>
<P>
	   Gold said the Cayugas would not call any witnesses and instead rely on the
federal government's single witness, a real estate appraiser who has placed the
land's current market value at $264.7 million and its rental value at $70.5
million.
</P>
<P>
	   The state, however, expected to call several witnesses and finish its case
with testimony from its own expert appraiser, who put the land's current worth
at between $25 million and $40 million and its rental value at no more than $6
million.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of the testimony will be about the different methods the two appraisers
used to do their calculations. On Monday, the attorneys took turns trumpeting
their side's method while telling jurors about the flaws it would show in the
other side's approach.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our role here is as tribal guardian," said Hank Meshorer, the lead attorney
for the U.S. Justice Department, suggesting the federal government's appraiser
was more credible. "The United States has nothing to gain or lose in this case.
He was told to appraise the land's value. No more, no less."
</P>
<P>
	   Among the differences, the state's appraiser calculated the land's value by
considering it as a large single tract, while the federal government's appraiser
figured it out as smaller subdivisions and used different formulas covering
three separate time periods.
</P>
<P>
	   Each side also used a different percentage to derive the land's rental
value. The state based its results on 2 percent of the property's market value
and the federal government used 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Roberts said jurors also would hear evidence that New York has been paying
the Cayugas a $1,800 annuity ever since purchasing the land in 1795.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial is expected to last two to three weeks.

<HEADLINE> Defense accuses police of "rushing to judgment" in 1973 slaying  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - Rather than wait to analyze all the crime-scene
evidence, police rushed ahead and charged a transvestite prostitute with killing
a businessman in 1973 on the basis of a coerced confession, a defense attorney
charged.
<P>
	   At the retrial of John Duval, 47, whose murder conviction was overturned
last spring after he'd spent 25 years in prison, attorney Reginald Towe pointed
out that authorities never presented any physical evidence against Duval at his
1973 trial.
</P>
<P>
	   "Police in the city of Rochester simply rushed to judgment in this matter
... before they had all the physical evidence analyzed," he said in opening
statements Monday. "They just simply didn't care."
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutor Joseph Curran promised to present jurors "credible evidence" that
Duval took part in the killing. "Free of any sympathy ... there will be but one
verdict," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A retired detective, Joseph Dominick, denied that he had ever threatened,
coerced or struck Duval during his 19 hours in custody, or saw anyone else do
so.
</P>
<P>
	   Duval and a fellow prostitute, Betty Tyson, got 25 years to life
imprisonment for the strangling of Timothy Haworth, a Philadelphia business
consultant who left his Rochester hotel late on May 24, 1973, apparently to look
for a prostitute.
</P>
<P>
	   They were convicted of murder on the basis of confessions they insist were
beaten out of them by a rogue detective, William Mahoney, and on the testimony
on two teen-age runaways, one of whom revealed in 1997 that he'd been terrorized
by Mahoney into lying.
</P>
<P>
	   The convictions were overturned after prosecutors then came upon a buried
synopsis of a police interview with the other teen-ager, Jon Jackson, in which
he denied seeing them with the victim - contrary to what he testified at trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Haworth, 52, was battered with a brick and asphyxiated with his necktie in
an alley. Police suspect the motive was robbery.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities found tire tracks near the body and rounded up prostitutes who
had cars. Only after Tyson and Duval were charged did they realize that her
car's tire treads didn't match.
</P>
<P>
	   Duval maintains that chief detective William Mahoney forced him to sign a
confession he later recanted. Mahoney, investigated at least 10 times for
allegedly abusing suspects, resigned in 1980 after fabricating evidence in an
unrelated case. He died in 1981.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors decided not to retry Tyson - the city gave her $1.2 million in
compensation - but went after Duval again. While Tyson had steadfastly
maintained her innocence, Duval had twice admitted his guilt before a parole
board.
</P>
<P>
	   Duval insists he lied because he didn't think he would be freed until he
admitted guilt.

<HEADLINE> New York, 15 other states sue Publishers Clearing House  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Publishers Clearing House surprises its sweepstakes
winners with its annual Super Bowl Sunday "Prize Patrol."
<P>
	   The Port Washington company got a surprise of its own Monday as sixteen
states broke off settlement negotiations and sued it for misleading consumers
into believing they had a better chance of winning if they ordered more
products.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are dismayed and disappointed that New York has chosen to abandon
negotiation and proceed with legal action against our company," said Bill Low,
lawyer and senior vice president for the sweepstakes company.
</P>
<P>
	   New Mexico Attorney General Patricia Madrid said states had to file suit
against the company "to put an end to its false, misleading and deceptive
mailings that induce New Mexicans, and particularly our senior citizens, to
purchase items that they do not truly want or need."
</P>
<P>
	   Also suing Monday were Colorado, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Jersey,
Illinois, Ohio, Oklahoma, Vermont, Oregon, Pennsylvania, West Virginia,
Louisiana, Georgia and California.
</P>
<P>
	   "Publishers Clearing House is very artful in stating half-truths to create
an overall impression that the particular consumer will be more likely to win an
enormous cash prize if he or she purchases something," Minnesota Attorney
General Mike Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuits were filed individually in local courts in each state. However,
New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said the lawsuits were sparked by a
multi-state investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   "This sweepstakes company has engaged in an elaborate scheme to increase its
bottom line, financed on the backs of some who can least afford it: the
elderly," Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
	   That brings the number of states suing Publishers Clearing House to 25.
Arizona, Texas, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, Washington
and Wisconsin already have sued the company.
</P>
<P>
	   Pennsylvania Attorney General Mike Fisher agreed with Spitzer. 'The
company's alleged illegal business practices shamelessly prey on older
Pennsylvanians who spend a lot of money on magazines and other items ...
convinced that the Prize Patrol is about to deliver thousands of dollars to
their door," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Publisher's Clearing House for years has been targeting the elderly and the
gullible with a blizzard of deceptive mailers that are really disguised sales
pitches," California Attorney General Bill Lockyer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Publishers Clearing House spokesman Chris Fisher denied it targets senior
citizens.
</P>
<P>
	   "Publishers Clearing House does not target the elderly," he said. "We don't
even know the ages of our consumers. ... Our market is the U.S. population."
</P>
<P>
	   The most recent lawsuit accuses the company of:
</P>
<P>
	   - Faking handwritten notes, internal memos, government documents and
personal letters to get people to apply quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   - Hiding bulk-rate mailings with official looking symbols and large bold
print warnings.
</P>
<P>
	   - Routinely asking customers for information that would only be needed if
they actually had won a prize.
</P>
<P>
	   - Requesting information for customers who order magazines that it does not
ask from people who do not order magazines.
</P>
<P>
	   Spitzer and the other attorneys general want Publishers Clearing House
banned from using its current promotions and for the company to pay unspecified
restitution.
</P>
<P>
	   Spitzer also wants civil penalties under the state's deceptive acts statute
and the state Prize Award Scheme Law, as well as an additional $10,000 for
violations of a state law enacted to penalize frauds perpetrated against the
elderly.

<HEADLINE> Report alleges intimate relation clouded office management  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The former director of a Connecticut agency that
serves the blind has resigned from state service in the wake of a report that
detailed sexual harassment and mismanagement in his office.
<P>
	   Kenneth R. Tripp was transferred from his position at the Board of Education
and Services for the Blind last month and assigned to a non-management job in
special education at the state Education Department.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for Gov. John G. Rowland said Tripp handed in his resignation on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General Richard Blumenthal earlier in the day announced an
investigation into Tripp found favoritism linked to an office affair,
mismanagement and an environment of sexual harassment and intimidation.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigation of Tripp was prompted by several complaints from workers
within the agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Blumenthal said problems were fueled by an affair between Tripp and Karen
Urciuoli, a clerical employee of the agency whom Tripp promoted three times
within 15 months to positions beyond her qualifications.
</P>
<P>
	   Blumenthal had recommended that Rowland, who appointed Tripp to the agency
in 1996, take appropriate disciplinary action to "send the critical message that
favoritism and intimidation, sexual or otherwise, have no place in state
government."
</P>
<P>
	   A spokeswoman for Blumenthal said the attorney general turned over a copy of
the report to the Chief State's Attorney's Office, although he is not
recommending criminal charges against Tripp.
</P>
<P>
	   Blumenthal's report also recommends action against John Whitman, the
director of operations under Tripp, and Steven J. Shapiro, the principal
personnel officer.
</P>
<P>
	   Tripp also hired Urciuoli's cousin, Susan Mannix, and then promoted her
within six months to executive secretary, according to Blumenthal, who said the
promotions violated state government personnel statutes and regulations.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the report, several workers claimed that Tripp inappropriately
touched many female workers and directed sexual comments, sexual innuendo and
profanity toward staff members.
</P>
<P>
	   Tripp, whose agency was formed to help the blind, was accused of being
insensitive to the blind and visually impaired, making jokes and removing them
from their jobs without justification.
</P>
<P>
	   In one instance, an agency worker testified, Tripp replaced a blind
receptionist at the agency's front desk because he thought blind people were
unattractive.
</P>
<P>
	   Tripp could not be reached for comment Monday. Phone calls to his office
number were not returned.
</P>
<P>
	   Blumenthal said 53 current and former employees of the agency were
subpoenaed and interviewed during the investigation, which was spurred by eight
whistle-blower complaints.

<HEADLINE> Officials blame financial mismanagement for Dempsey deficit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - University of Connecticut officials dispute a
state report that alleges financial mismanagement of the UConn Health Center.
<P>
	   The state Office of Health Care Access report, released Monday, says UConn
tried to hide a $21 million deficit, doled out questionable contracts and set up
multimillion dollar programs without proper approval.
</P>
<P>
	   Raymond Gorman, OHCA's commissioner, said he found the problems while
developing recommendations on what should be done with the money-losing John
Dempsey Hospital, which is part of the health center operation.
</P>
<P>
	   "The conclusions are not founded on fact," said Lorraine Aronson, UConn's
chief financial officer. "There is nothing that backs up any of the allegations
concerning financial problems in the report."
</P>
<P>
	   The report says the 204-bed hospital should stay open for now, but it needs
strict financial oversight.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't feel there has been sufficient oversight of the financial
operations at the health center," Gorman said.
</P>
<P>
	   The OHCA report was delivered to the General Assembly and the Attorney
General on Monday, Gorman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gorman said the UConn Health Care Center, which also includes the
university's medical and dental schools, should be reviewed by an independent
auditing agency. That could cost $500,000 and take up to nine months, Gorman
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The General Assembly allowed the health center to forego paying certain
taxes last June to save them from what was believed to be a $6.5 million
deficit. But Gorman said the problem was actually much worse.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Legislature was led to believe...that fixed the budget problems at John
Dempsey Hospital," Gorman said. "But the numbers were not based on reality."
</P>
<P>
	   In October, the health center reported a $14 million shortfall, and soon
revised that projection to a $21 million deficit.
</P>
<P>
	   Aronson acknowledged the health center's deficit, but said all other state
hospitals and many medical centers across the country also are in the red.
</P>
<P>
	   "We know where every penny is coming from where every penny is going and
we're fixing the problem," said Aronson.
</P>
<P>
	   Gorman said OHCA is also concerned about a $2.25 million contract UConn
entered into with a private company that manages OB/GYN and in-vitro
fertilization services at the health center.
</P>
<P>
	   Gorman questioned whether public money should be paying for a private
company to run a state operation.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that's something policy makers need to deal with," he said. "But
most importantly, we don't see any evidence that this was in the financial best
interest of the university."
</P>
<P>
	   Gorman said the health center also set up three new programs - including
units for a cardiac step-down service, ambulatory surgery and medical psychiatry
- without OHCA approval. New hospital services that cost more than $1 million
must have OHCA approval, Gorman said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Programs like that certainly would constitute a new service and in most
cases would also exceed the capital threshold of $1 million."
</P>
<P>
	   Aronson, a budget chief for former Gov. Lowell Weicker, said that allegation
is based on a misinterpretation of law, and criticized the OHCA report.
</P>
<P>
	   House Democratic leaders said last week they want to keep Dempsey Hospital
open, and are willing to help plug the health center's deficit. Lawmakers have
not said how much they'll give the health center, but insisted the facility
would not be given a blank check.
</P>
<P>
	   The OHCA report recommends that any money the Legislature hands over should
be a one-time bailout, and stressed that an independent board should oversee the
health center's finances.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Toni Harp, co-chairwoman of the legislature's Public Health Committee,
said the OHCA report is filled with speculation.
</P>
<P>
	   "I find the report's allegation of fraud...to be particularly
inappropriate," said Harp, D-New Haven. "There is no proof offered. Without
proof, the allegation is baseless and irresponsible."

<HEADLINE> Trail Blazers 101, Nets 87  </HEADLINE>
    By LANDON HALL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Arvydas Sabonis had 21 points and 13 rebounds and
Greg Anthony hit three fourth-quarter 3-pointers to help the Portland Trail
Blazers hold off the New Jersey Nets 101-87 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Rasheed Wallace added 17 points for the Blazers, who won their seventh
straight at home and pulled within 1 1/2 games of the Los Angeles Lakers in the
Pacific Division. The Lakers lost to the Utah Jazz in double-overtime.
</P>
<P>
	   Stephon Marbury led the Nets with 21 points, but had only three after
halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   The game went back and forth for most of the second half, and two straight
3-pointers by Lucious Harris put the Nets up for the last time, 74-73, with
10:43 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   Portland then went on a 17-2 run, and the third of Anthony's left-handed
3-pointers gave the Blazers a 86-76 lead with 7:23 to go. A short jumper by
Bonzi Wells and a layup by Detlef Schrempf off a dish from Wells made it 90-76
with 6:11 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Smith added 16 points and Scottie Pippen had 10 assists for the
Blazers, who were coming off their biggest win of the season, a 95-91 win at the
Lakers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey, which is 13-10 at home, fell to 4-14 on the road.
</P>
<P>
	   Keith Van Horn 17 points and Kendall Gill had 14 for New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nets, who began a four-game West Coast trip after winning two straight
at home, couldn't contain the 7-foot-3 Sabonis early. He scored 14 of the
Blazers' 26 points in the first quarter and had eight of their 16 rebounds, but
the 34-year-old Lithuanian stayed on the bench for nearly nine minutes in the
second quarter, and the Blazers stumbled.
</P>
<P>
	   Portland led by four to start the period, but got behind 50-37 when Marbury
hit a 19-foot jumper with 1:53 left. Damon Stoudamire hit a baseline jumper and
Sabonis and Smith hit four free throws to help the Blazers pull to 50-43.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blazers went on a 14-0 run on Stoudamire's steal and layup to put the
Blazers ahead 51-50 early in the third. The lead changed six times after that,

    SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Karl Malone scored 31 points and John Stockton had 18
points, 15 assists and nine rebounds as the Utah Jazz outlasted the Los Angeles
Lakers 105-101 in double overtime Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Quincy Lewis scored six points in the second overtime and Stockton added
four as the Jazz sent the Lakers to their fourth loss in the last six games.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff Hornacek, the NBA's top free throw shooter who had missed the last
three games with knee and back strains, made two foul shots with 53 seconds left
to make it 99-95 and added two more with 7.9 seconds to play to make it 101-96.
</P>
<P>
	   Kobe Bryant made a long 3-pointer to cut it to 103-101 but Lewis sank two
more free throws and the Jazz escaped with their fifth win in six games.
</P>
<P>
	   Shaquille O'Neal lead all scorers with 36 points and played 55 minutes but
scored just four points after regulation. Bryant had 26 points on 9-of-24
shooting and Glen Rice added 20 for Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   The teams traded baskets through most of the first overtime before Stockton
hit a 3-pointer with 34 seconds left to put Utah up 91-89.
</P>
<P>
	   Bryant missed a shot but Rice rebounded and hit a turnaround jumper to tie
it again. Malone missed a 3-pointer at the buzzer to force another overtime.
</P>
<P>
	   Stockton, who has never had a triple-double in his 16 seasons, matched his
career high in rebounds with nine and played a season-high 47 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jazz trailed 72-70 when Malone began delivering for the Jazz. Malone
outscored the Lakers 9-4 with an array of jumpers and a free throw to give Utah
a 79-76 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Stockton made it 81-77 with a baseline jumper but in the last minute both
Malone and Stockton committed turnovers while Bryant and Rice hit jump shots to
tie the game. Rice had a chance to win it at the buzzer but missed a leaning
14-foot jumper.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neal scored the Lakers first 10 points of the second half and made a layup
to give Los Angeles a 61-60 lead with 2:28 left in the third.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neal went to the bench and the Jazz held the Lakers scoreless for the rest
of the quarter while hitting six free throws to take a 66-61 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Bryant sparked the Lakers with a breakaway reverse dunk during a 9-2 run to
open the fourth. Derek Fisher's baseline jumper knotted the game at 70 with 7:12
to play.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jazz took a 44-43 halftime lead behind Malone's 12 first-half points.

<P>
    EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Sergei Krivokrasov scored 1:19 into overtime
Monday night to give the Nashville Predators a 3-2 victory over the Edmonton
Oilers.
</P>
<P>
	   Krivokrasov took a back-hand pass from Greg Johnson and jammed the puck past
Tommy Salo as the Oilers dropped to 0-7-13 in overtime this season. Mark Mowers
and Vitali Yachmenev also scored for Nashville, which went to overtime for the
third time in four games.
</P>
<P>
	   Janne Niinimaa and Josef Beranek scored for the Oilers, who are four games
shy of the NHL record for most overtime games, set by Philadelphia last season.
</P>
<P>
	   Mowers started the scoring with just three seconds left in the second
period. Drake Berehowsky slid the puck ahead just outside the Oilers' blue line
and Mowers fooled Salo on a long shot.
</P>
<P>
	   In the third period, Todd Marchant made an excellent cross-ice pass to
Niinimaa, who was racing in from the blue line and beat goalie Mike Dunham at
3:47 to make it 1-1.
</P>
<P>
	   Marchant has four goals and six assists in a career-high seven-game points
streak.
</P>
<P>
	   Eight minutes later, Yachmenev broke in with Ville Peltonen and beat Salo
with a screened shot from the high slot at 11:47 to give the Predators a 2-1.
Yachmenev has scored at least one goal in four consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
	   Beranek tied it with his first goal since Dec. 11. He beat Dunham with a
heavy shot from the top of the faceoff circle at 15:01.

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Rod Smith Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CASTLE ROCK, Colo. (AP) -- Denver Broncos wide receiver Rod Smith was
arrested Monday on charges of third-degree assault and harassment after an
altercation last week with his common-law wife, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith, 29, surrendered to the Douglas County Sheriff's Department on Monday
morning. He posted $5,000 bail and was released, sheriff's Sgt. Attila Denes
said.
</P>
<P>
	   An affidavit filed in Douglas County District Court alleges Smith choked,
beat and shoved 27-year-old Jami Mourglia during an argument Wednesday at their
home in Parker southeast of Denver.
</P>
<P>
	   The affidavit describes Mourglia as Smith's common-law wife. They have two
children.
</P>
<P>
	   Mourglia told officers she and Smith were having marital problems and were
arguing over who would get custody of the children if they separated, the
affidavit said.
</P>
<P>
	   She said Smith choked her, dragged her into another room, pulled her hair,
banged her head into the floor and hit her, and that she said she hit him back.
</P>
<P>
	   If convicted, Smith could be sentenced to two years in prison and fined
$5,000.
</P>
<P>
	   A judge issued a restraining order Monday directing Smith to stay away from
Mourglia.
</P>
<P>
	   Broncos spokesman Jim Saccomano, reached at the Super Bowl in Atlanta, said
he had not heard of Smith's arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith has played in the NFL for five years, all with the Broncos, and posted
more than 1,000 yards receiving in the 1999 season. His 80-yard reception in
Denver's NFL Championship win over Atlanta last year tied a record for the
second-longest touchdown catch in Super Bowl history.

<HEADLINE> Late-punch victim sues Tyson for alleged oral-contract breach  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A boxer who took a late punch from Mike Tyson in the
ring is charging in a $2 million lawsuit that the former heavyweight champion
has now sucker-punched him outside the ring.
<P>
	   Orlin Norris of Lubbock, Texas, says Tyson's manager, Shelly Finkel,
promised him an immediate rematch if he would say he believed Tyson's punch
after the first-round bell in their fight last Oct. 23 was accidental.
</P>
<P>
	   Norris, 34, says in papers filed Monday in Manhattan's State Supreme Court
that he reluctantly spoke up for Tyson but that Tyson's camp now is denying any
such deal was made.
</P>
<P>
	   Norris' lawyer, Judd Burstein, said he has at least four witnesses who heard
Finkel, afraid that Nevada boxing officials would suspend Tyson, make the offer
in Norris' dressing room after the fight in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevada had earlier suspended Tyson and fined him $3 million for biting off
part of Evander Holyfield's ear during a fight on June 28, 1997, in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
	   Burstein said Tyson now is trying to back out of the deal with Norris
because he's scared.
</P>
<P>
	   "Tyson's afraid to fight Norris, who hit him very hard two times as the
first-round bell rang," Burstein said. "Now that he knows he can expect a real
fight from Norris, he's ducking him."
</P>
<P>
	   Burstein continued: "For obvious reasons, he prefers to fight only those
fights he feels sure he can win. At the rate he's going, his next opponent will
be Britney Spears."
</P>
<P>
	   The Oct. 23 fight was stopped immediately and declared no contest after
Norris went down, got up and limped back to his corner with an injured knee,
which he apparently hurt when he hit the canvas.
</P>
<P>
	   Tyson is in England preparing for his Jan. 29 fight with Britain's Julius
Francis in Manchester.
</P>
<P>
	   Burstein says his client's lawsuit asks for $2 million because that is what
he was promised for his next fight with Tyson.
</P>
<P>
	   Norris' lawsuit asks the court to order Showtime, the cable network that
carries Tyson's matches, to freeze $2 million of the fighter's Jan. 29 purse.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Tyson's lawyer, Jim Jimmerson, says he has asked the U.S.
District Court in Las Vegas to declare that no oral agreement exists between
Tyson and Norris.
</P>
<P>
	   "My client wants to be free to fight whomever he chooses," said Jimmerson.
"It's not so much that he doesn't want to fight Norris. He just doesn't want to
be bound by some nonexistent agreement."
</P>
<P>
	   A few days after the Oct. 23 fight, boxing officials voted against punishing
Tyson for the late hit on Norris and released his $8.7 million purse, which they
had held since the fight.
</P>
<P>
	   Norris officially got $800,000 for the fight, but because of liens and
taxes, he actually collected a little more than $200,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Tyson's Nevada boxing license expired Dec. 31. Officials there have warned
that he will have a difficult time getting it renewed anytime soon.

<HEADLINE> Like it or not, the corset is here to stay  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A straight-laced woman is never loose. Or is she?
<P>
	   From Catherine de Medici to Madonna, women have cinched their bodies into
corsets of every imaginable description. Now the contraptions are on view at the
Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Corset: Fashioning the Body" spans 400 years of women - and a few men -
wearing corsets.
</P>
<P>
	   Men? Yup.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 19th century, both dandies and older men wore corsets, minus the
hourglass shape.
</P>
<P>
	   Apollo, an 1880-1890 corset made of metal and lace, was a favorite among
cavalry officers. And while most men wore corsets for medical reasons, there was
also the occasional cross-dresser.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, corsets are symbols of femininity, and the point of most is to mold a
woman's body into an hourglass shape.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 16th century, there was the rare all-metal corset, with its 14-inch
waist constructed from six horizontal strips of steel. Some historians think it
was an orthopedic device designed to correct spinal deformities.
</P>
<P>
	   As the centuries marched on, the corset evolved for ... um ... comfort.
</P>
<P>
	   The 19th century's Pretty Housemaid corset was mass produced and was
advertised as the strongest and cheapest corset ever made. Unlike many of its
predecessors, it was not made of whalebone, because the material was too
expensive. The elegant red bodice with white lace trim looks more wearable than
what appeared 100 years later.
</P>
<P>
	   But there's still a 1997 edition by Dean Sonnenberg and Anthony Pacesa, who
created a double-corseted dress with a 16-inch waist. (Not even Scarlett O'Hara
could swing that.)
</P>
<P>
	   The metallic leather and silk moirDe dress with a built-in internal corset
is owned by Catherine Jung, who is a tight-lacer. The outer layer silver-over
corset looks like a metal shield but is purely decorative and cannot be
adjusted.
</P>
<P>
	   The dress looks medieval.
</P>
<P>
	   "What hell our women have to go through tied and bound," to quote Montaigne.
</P>
<P>
	   So whose idea were these things?
</P>
<P>
	   "Women wore corsets for almost 400 years, because comfort was judged less
important than social status, feminine beauty and respectability," museum
curator Valerie Steele said Monday. "The corset was a status symbol, because it
constrained the wearer's physical mobility, thus supposedly demonstrating that
she could afford servants."
</P>
<P>
	   Today, it's not about servants; it's about the popular gym-sculpted look.
And when diets and exercise fail, or liposuction seems over the top, there's
still the corset.
</P>
<P>
	   The modern version, made this year by Malaysian designer Yeohlee, uses Lycra
strips rather than whalebone to hold its shape.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're going forward," Yeohlee said. "Clothes are more shaped and
comfortable."
</P>
<P>
	   Let's hope so.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 18th and 19th centuries, tight corsets caused shortness of breath and
fainting because they restricted the chest and reduced lung capacity. In some
cases, they even permanently altered body shape.
</P>
<P>
	   They've come a long way, baby.

<HEADLINE> Rose Receives Living Legend Award  </HEADLINE>
    By KEN BERGER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHERRY HILL, N.J. (AP) -- With a standing ovation and a wisecrack for
baseball, Pete Rose accepted the "living legend" award Monday night from the
Philadelphia Sports Writers Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Rose, a member of the Phillies team that won the 1980 World Series, thanked
the city's fans and media for their honesty and had a punchline for the sport
that banned him for life following a gambling investigation in 1989.
</P>
<P>
	   "Allen Iverson didn't make the Olympic team. I've got that figured out,"
Rose said. "Baseball must have selected that team."
</P>
<P>
	   When a cell phone rang during Rose's brief acceptance speech, he said,
"Quick, answer that. It's probably Bud Selig calling me."
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, there was some news regarding Rose's bid for reinstatement.
According to Rose's agent, Warren Greene, the commissioner's office has proposed
several dates next month for a meeting between Rose attorney Roger Makley and
baseball lawyer Bob DuPuy. Rose applied for reinstatement in 1997, but has
received no formal response.
</P>
<P>
	   "All we want is a dialogue," Greene said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also among those honored at the association's 96th annual banquet were
former NBA star Charles Barkley (career achievement), NBA scoring leader Iverson
(pro athlete of the year) and golfer Jay Sigel (most courageous athlete.)
</P>
<P>
	   Rose received support from several speakers, including current Phillies
manager Terry Francona, who played with Rose in 1984.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think a baseball player could ever hope to have a better teammate
than Pete Rose," Francona said. "Pete, whatever you hope for in the future, I
hope you get it, man. You've got a fan right here."
</P>
<P>
	   Philadelphia 76ers coach Larry Brown added, "Any athlete in any sport could
appreciate what he's done. We all hope we have players who play hard, play the
right way and respect the game. I think that's the way you played, Pete."
</P>
<P>
	   Rose, joined by former Phillies teammates Bob Boone, Tug McGraw and Larry
Christenson, did not directly address his bid to be reinstated. He did make an
unfortunate reference to gambling.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wanted to come here," Rose said of signing with the Phillies. "I could
have went to Atlanta, I could have went to Kansas City, I could have went to St.
Louis. In Pittsburgh, they offered me race horses. You can bet your ass, if I
was negotiating today and somebody offered me a casino, I'd be right there."
</P>
<P>
	   The banquet included a poignant moment when Philadelphia Flyers coach Roger
Neilson was introduced. Neilson, being treated for bone marrow cancer, got a
rousing ovation as he walked to the podium for a brief speech.
</P>
<P>
	   "You guys over there," Neilson said, gesturing toward the side of the stage
where Rose was sitting. "You've got to have cancer to get a hand like that."
</P>
<P>
	   Selina Gross, Chamberlain's sister, also received an ovation when she
accepted her brother's athlete of the century award.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'll leave you with something that he probably would have said," Gross
said. "Do the best you can, while you can, and hopefully you'll be around to
receive your accolades."

<HEADLINE> Rockies Sign Billy Taylor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DENVER (AP) -- Free agent reliever Billy Taylor and the Colorado Rockies
agreed Monday to a $950,000, one-year contract.
</P>
<P>
	   Taylor, 38, has 100 career saves and a 4.02 ERA in 299 games for Oakland and
the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
	   Taylor was 1-5 with 26 saves and a 3.98 ERA for the Athletics last season.
They traded him to the Mets on July 31 for pitchers Jason Isringhausen and Greg
McMichael.
</P>
<P>
	   The sidearming right-hander struggled with the Mets and never was a factor
in their bullpen. He was 0-1 with no saves and an 8.10 ERA in 18 games, and was
left off New York's postseason roster.
</P>
<P>
	   Taylor is the 17th player the Rockies have added to their roster since the
end of the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
	   Taylor broke into the majors in 1994 with Oakland. He missed the 1995 season
with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
	   He gets a $900,000, one-year contract with the chance to earn $900,000 in
performance bonuses. The Rockies have a 2001 option for 2000 earnings with a
$50,000 buyout.

<HEADLINE> Davidian Prosecutor Stepping Down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas (AP) -- The federal prosecutor who was removed from the Branch
Davidian case after raising questions about a possible government cover-up is
resigning, saying Justice Department leaders have been ``less than forthright.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Attorney Bill Johnston said he is leaving his job as chief federal
prosecutor in Waco in two weeks to practice civil law. While he said he needed a
break, he also referred to the Davidian controversy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's no secret I've been frustrated by the Department of Justice,''
Johnston said in Tuesday's Waco Tribune-Herald. ``The vast majority of people in
the agency are great people. But at the leadership level, I feel some people
have been less than forthright.''
</P>
<P>
	   A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment Tuesday, and Johnston's
supervisors in San Antonio did not return calls.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnston, 40, helped draft the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
search warrant that became the basis of the 1993 raid and ensuing 51-day siege
at the compound near Waco. He later helped convict nine Davidians.
</P>
<P>
	   He was removed from the case last fall 10 days after sending a letter to
Attorney General Janet Reno in which he warned that he had seen documents
indicating that government lawyers had known for years about pyrotechnic
grenades being used during the standoff.
</P>
<P>
	   The FBI has admitted that incendiary devices were used, but denies starting
the fire on April 19, 1993, in which Davidian leader David Koresh and about 80
others perished.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnston, appointed an assistant U.S. attorney in 1987, also drew criticism
from many inside the Justice Department last spring when he allowed Mike
McNulty, one of the producers of the Oscar-nominated documentary ``Waco: Rules
of Engagement,'' to tour a locker where Davidian evidence was stored.
</P>
<P>
	   McNulty reported finding FBI projectiles, which he said were capable of
starting a fire.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, FBI employees have reportedly testified that flashes seen in an
infrared surveillance video of the siege are ``glint,'' not gunfire.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tribune-Herald reviewed the statements of 20 FBI employees, including
technicians, pilots and infrared video operators. The agents were deposed for
the upcoming wrongful-death lawsuit filed against the government by surviving
Branch Davidians and their families.
</P>
<P>
	   The agents were not identified, the newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In one deposition, a pilot who flew the plane carrying the video camera said
``glint'' was ``an unexplained phenomenon'' that sometimes appears on infared
tape during the day. Another FBI employee likened the flashes to the shine from
a car fender or hood.
</P>
<P>
	   Plaintiffs' attorney Michael Caddell attacked the theory.
</P>
<P>
	   ``How did we distinguish between a glint and something else?'' Caddell asked
during a deposition. ``Is it a glint when it might have otherwise been gunfire
from an FBI agent?''
</P>
<P>
	   Federal officials have insisted that no government shots were fired when the
siege ended. Some of those who died had gunshot wounds, but the government says
the Davidians died by their own hands.

Bush, Gore Score Victories in Iowa
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Republican George W. Bush scored a
closer-than-expected victory Monday night in the Iowa presidential caucuses,
besting Steve Forbes to set the stage for a high-stakes three-way race in the
New Hampshire primary. Democrats gave Al Gore a big win over Bill Bradley who
said he had "a little more humility" and vowed to push his challenge. "I can't
wait to get to New Hampshire," was Gore's battle cry and he said he'd be
campaigning Tuesday at dawn. Bush described the caucus results as validation of
his compassionate conservative agenda. The Texas governor roused supporters with
the vow, "tonight is the beginning of the end of the Clinton era."

	   CAMPTON, N.H. (AP) -- Unlike Iowa, New Hampshire has presidential races on
both the Republican and Democratic sides that are too close to call -- thanks to
independent voters and effective appeals from well-funded insurgents. "It's
going to be very close," contended Arizona Sen. John McCain on Monday after
two-fisting his way through doughnuts, coffee and gummy bears toward his 100th
town hall-style meeting, this one in Plymouth. Polls suggest McCain is right.
Both he and former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley pose strong challenges in the

U.S. Attorney Bill Johnston said he is leaving his job as chief federal
prosecutor in Waco in two weeks to practice civil law. While he said he needed a

	   LYNCHBURG, Va. (AP) -- The Rev. Jerry Falwell has sued the White House and
the FBI for denying a request for information about him that he contends is kept
in a "secret" Justice Department database about religious and anti-abortion
leaders. Falwell sought the information last summer under the Freedom of
Information Act after being told of the alleged database by Judicial Watch, a
conservative Washington group that said it learned of the material through an
anonymous source. Falwell contends that keeping information about him in the
database is a violation of the Privacy Act, which makes it illegal for the
government to keep a file on a person without a lawful reason.

Cuban Boy Bill Filed in Congress

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A group of Florida lawmakers put in motion Monday a
process to give citizenship to 6-year-old Cuban refugee Elian Gonzalez, without
his father's consent. Meanwhile the boy's two grandmothers arrived in Washington
late Monday from Miami where they had waited five hours, but were unsuccessful
in their quest to meeting with their grandson. Sponsors hoped to whisk the
request through Congress, largely to remove the case from the jurisdiction of
the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which has ruled that the boy should
be returned to his father in Cuba. Passage would also render moot a federal
court appeal of the INS ruling by Elian's great-uncle.

White House Backs Geothermal Energy
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration hopes to spur the growth of
the fledgling geothermal energy industry with $4.8 million in research grants.
Despite its abundance, geothermal energy has so far failed to capture much of
the electricity market. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson announced the modest
series of grants Monday for research aimed at finding and producing the
electricity more cheaply. Geothermal energy is generated from water or steam
heated by the earth's magma. The process pollutes less than gasoline or even
natural gas typically used to generate electricity. But the costs of finding
drill sites and building electrical plants have hindered exploration and
development so far.

<TEXT>
<P>
    LAKE HAVASU CITY, Ariz. (AP) -- San Francisco 49ers quarterback Steve Young
says he still hasn't decided whether to return to the team next season.
</P>
<P>
	   Young, sidelined for the final 13 games of the 1999 season by concussions,
told students at Lake Havasu High School on Monday that he had been "playing for
30 years, and that's a long time."
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not sure if I'm coming back," he said. "I'm not sure if coming back is
the smartest thing to do."
</P>
<P>
	   Young suffered the fourth concussion of his professional career when he
played the Arizona Cardinals in the third game of the season on Sept. 27. The
blow from Aeneas Williams knocked Young unconscious, and Young remained on the
disabled list for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
	   Young's speech stressed the importance of not giving up.
</P>
<P>
	   And though San Francisco executive and former coach Bill Walsh told Fox
Sports reporter Jim Rome recently that he would like to see Young retire for
health reasons, Young said Monday he's not heard that comment directly from
Walsh.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've talked with Bill, we've had long talks about it (retirement). But I
don't know that he's ever said that to me," Young said.
</P>
<P>
	   Young said he would notify 49ers brass "within the next couple of months" of
his plans for the upcoming season.

<HEADLINE> Sharpton, Amadou Diallo's parents press for federal monitor of  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Rev. Al Sharpton promised prayer-filled protests
at the Albany trial of four white police officers charged with killing Amadou
Diallo, saying the protests would be nothing like the more raucous ones that
shook New York City.
<P>
	   "We're not dealing with New York City police problems in Albany," Sharpton
said Monday after a meeting with top Justice Department officials about the
case. "We're dealing with the case, and we're dealing with giving support to the
family."
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton said he would meet with Albany church groups tonight.
</P>
<P>
	   The No. 2 official at the Justice Department told Sharpton and Diallo's
parents on Monday that federal officials would monitor the trial of the four
officers charged with gunning down the unarmed black immigrant.
</P>
<P>
	   But Assistant Attorney General Eric Holder did not say specifically what
kind of federal scrutiny the racially charged case would face, according to
those at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   "We received no assurances except that we would receive a thorough review,"
Sharpton said after a meeting that lasted more than an hour with Holder and Bill
Lamb Lee, head of the Attorney General's Civil Rights Division.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-Harlem, and a handful of church officials joined the
Diallo family and Sharpton at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton and other black activists are upset that the trial of the officers
charged with firing 41 bullets at Diallo was moved from the Bronx, where the
shooting took place. Attorneys for the officers had argued the wave of pretrial
publicity would make it impossible to find an impartial jury in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton said he was optimistic because of the attention given to the case
by Holder, Attorney General Janet Reno's top assistant.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo family attorney Bob Conason said the hope is to have a Justice
Department official in the courtroom monitoring testimony in case federal
officials decide to pursue civil rights charges against the officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo's shooting touched off weeks of angry protests in New York City
alleging widespread police brutality against minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   Jury selection is set to begin in the case next week.
</P>
<P>
	   But Sharpton said on Monday although he opposed moving the trial upstate he
had no quarrel with Albany or the Albany police.
</P>
<P>
	   "What the courts decided should not be an excuse to divide the people in
Albany against the people of New York City," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Plainclothes Officers Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon, Richard Murphy and
Kenneth Boss were indicted on second-degree murder charges in March after
shooting Diallo 19 times while searching for violent criminals. Attorneys for
the officers claimed their clients mistakenly believed the street vendor was
reaching for a gun.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Shipwreck Splits Mom, Daughter  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN RICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARDENAS, Cuba (AP) -- As the world watches an international custody battle
over Cuban shipwreck survivor Elian Gonzalez, another child who started out on
the same boat also is at the center of a debate across the Florida Straits.
</P>
<P>
	   Estefani Herrera is a 5-year-old girl with curly hair that flies in the wind
as she races into her grandmother's arms in front of their house on Vives
Street, roughly a mile from the house where Elian's father lives in Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
	   She's lucky to be alive. But her future, like that of Elian, is tangled in
the sort of family disruption common to Cubans who have fled to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
	   Estefani's mother, Arianne Horta, started to take the child on the ill-fated
boat trip to the United States in late November. But when the boat had initial
problems and had to return to shore, she decided to leave Estefani behind,
hoping to send for her later, she told a Miami news conference on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   On the second attempt to reach the United States, the boat sank, killing 11
people. Only 6-year-old Elian, Horta, 22, and her boyfriend Nivaldo Fernandez
survived. Fernandez left a wife and two children behind in Cuba, according to
Cuba's state-run Radio Rebelde.
</P>
<P>
	   In her news conference, Horta appealed for help in reuniting with Estefani:
``From the moment she was born, she slept with me every night. Do you know how I
feel?''
</P>
<P>
	   Horta appealed for a way to bring her daughter to the United States as soon
as possible. Once she is a legal resident, she could apply to bring Estefani to
the United States. That process might keep the girl in Cuba for more than a
year, even if no one objects to her departure.
</P>
<P>
	   But back home in Cardenas, the child's grandmother and father, too, insist
they love the child and balk at the idea of giving her up, at least right now.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would not like it to be so soon,'' said the grandmother, Elsa
Alfonso.``Well, that doesn't mean that in the future I am going to refuse it
because she is her mother.''
</P>
<P>
	   She said she would like to see her daughter is ``stable someplace, that she
has work,'' before the child leaves. Horta and Estefani, her only daughter and
granddaughter, lived in her house.
</P>
<P>
	   The father, Victor Herrera, is more certain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm the father, and she has gone. If I have to take her into my house, I
will take her,'' he said at the Varadero hotel where he tends a bar facing the
famed Caribbean beach -- a coveted job in Cuba, especially because he receives
some income in dollars. He and Estefani's mother separated shortly after the
girl was born.
</P>
<P>
	   Alfonso seemed torn by a sense of joy at her daughter's survival and a sense
of loss at having her far away, with the prospect that her only granddaughter
might be leaving.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have always believed in God and after what happened with my daughter, I
believe much more,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The mutual affection is also obvious between Alfonso and the child who
tightly hugged her around the neck before racing out to play with friends.
</P>
<P>
	   Partly because a housing shortage often forces young married couples to
share a home with their parents, grandmothers in Cuba often play a far greater
role in child-rearing than they might in the United States
</P>
<P>
	   ``I raised my granddaughter. My granddaughter never was in anybody else's
house,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Estefani ``loves her grandmother very much,'' said the father, Herrera.
``And she also loved her mother very much. I imagine she is missing her.''
</P>
<P>
	   But he, too, said he loves his daughter and spends his free days with her.
</P>
<P>
	   When he heard that her mother had fled for the United States, ``I went
quickly to the house to see if the girl was there. When I saw her, I felt such
relief,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Alfonso said she has two brothers who live in the United States, and a
husband who works for Cuba's Interior Ministry, which is in charge of the
country's security.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Politics has nothing to do with sentiment,'' she said. But she admitted
Horta's departure had been hard on her husband.
</P>
<P>
	   Alfonso was angered by suggestions the case might be similar to that of
Elian, whose great-uncle in Miami is trying to prevent the child from being
returned to his father and grandparents in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That is criminal,'' she said. ``They are going to deny him a right to a
future.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's Miami relatives have been caring for him since he was found clinging
to an inner tube off the Florida coast on Nov. 25. His mother and 10 other
Cubans died in the attempt to reach the United States.

<HEADLINE> Croatian Voters Choosing President  </HEADLINE>
   By DANICA KIRKA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- Croatians turned away from their past in
presidential elections, voting overwhelmingly for two candidates who vowed to
cast aside the autocracy of the late President Franjo Tudjman and move toward
Western institutions.
</P>
<P>
	   In one of the highest turnouts ever in Croatia, 64 percent of voters cast
ballots Monday to replace the only leader the country has had since independence
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   Leading the nine-person field was Stipe Mesic, who won the support of more
than 40 percent of voters. Drazen Budisa, a leader of a left-leaning coalition
that won this month's parliamentary election, came in second with 28 percent.
The two will face off in a runoff Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
	   Voters seemed ready to be rid of Tudjman's style, discarding the late
leader's foreign minister, Mate Granic, a moderate who tried desperately to
distance himself from the authoritarian regime. He came in third with 21
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm satisfied with my campaign ... and what's most important, I'm
satisfied with the voters who gave me their confidence,'' Mesic said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mesic led the field going into the polls, espousing a clean break from
Tudjman's authoritarianism, which had left the country internationally isolated
and deep in economic recession.
</P>
<P>
	   Mesic and Budisa both pledged to direct the country into Western-oriented
institutions like the European Union and NATO, which shunned Croatia during the
Tudjman years.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Croats trekked in the snow only to wait hours to make their choice. A
total of 4.2 million voters, including citizens in 48 countries abroad, were
eligible to cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
	   Turnout was higher only at a 1991 referendum on Croatia's independence and
in parliamentary elections earlier this month, when Croats ousted Tudjman's
Croatian Democratic Union by a landslide, ending the nationalist party's almost
decade-long grip on power.
</P>
<P>
	   Tudjman, who led Croatia to independence, died Dec. 10.	   ``I want our new
president to lead us to Europe -- to make our lives better,'' said Inga Kobasic,
30, a secretary in the capital, Zagreb.
</P>
<P>
	   Western leaders welcomed the victory of a center-left coalition, which vowed
to institute radical economic and democratic reform and improve frayed ties with
the West.
</P>
<P>
	   As president of the junior partner in the victorious coalition, Budisa
seemed the most likely pick for voters seeking to bolster the coalition
government's goals. Opinion polls taken days before the contest, however, showed
that the 52-year-old trailed Mesic.
</P>
<P>
	   Political analysts and psychologists attributed Mesic's popularity to his
tongue-in-cheek manner and candid language -- a striking contrast to Tudjman's
somber demeanor.
</P>
<P>
	   The leading candidates publicly pledged to shift from Tudjman's course,
slashing state expenses while working on developing the brittle economy and
improving living standards. They pledged to fight corruption and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our new president must be honest -- that's all,'' said Tomislav Oresic, a
28-year-old doctor, alluding to widespread corruption and nepotism that
characterized Tudjman's tenure.

<HEADLINE> Test May Help Spot Stem Rot Disease  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL PEARSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARBONDALE, Ill. (AP) -- University researchers are working on a field test
for soybean stem rot that could help farmers spot the costly and untreatable
disease sooner, so they don't waste time and money raising a doomed crop.
</P>
<P>
	   Such a test, under development at Southern Illinois University, would also
give researchers a better tool to test varieties for resistance to the disease,
which is present in virtually every soybean field and can cost farmers 30
percent of their yield, said Craig Grau, a professor of plant pathology at the
University of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we had a faster method, and possibly more accurate method, this would
really be what we need," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Stem rot can be a significant problem for soybean farmers, although Illinois
growers have not suffered a major outbreak in recent years, according to Matt
Montgomery of the University of Illinois Extension Service in Sangamon County.
</P>
<P>
	   The disease mostly affects crops in the upper Midwest, including northern
Illinois, Iowa and Wisconsin. It is caused by a fungus present in the soil that
causes soybean plant stems to rot from the inside. In severe cases, the disease
spreads to other parts of the plant and can dramatically affect yields.
</P>
<P>
	   Current tests take three to four weeks to confirm the presence of stem rot,
meaning farmers must continue caring for crops that may produce little, if any
profit.
</P>
<P>
	   What the test researchers are aiming for would be similar to a home
pregnancy test in simplicity and speed, said SIU microbiologist John Martinko,
who is conducting the research under a grant from the Illinois Soybean Checkoff
Board.
</P>
<P>
	   The test kit would consist of a plastic strip coated with proteins taken
from stem-rot fungus and a solution containing antibodies produced by rabbits
injected with the fungus. Farmers would grind up part of a suspect soybean
plant, mix that material into the solution and then insert the plastic strip.
</P>
<P>
	   A strip that changes color would indicate a plant that is free of the
disease, Martinko said.
</P>
<P>
	   His team expects to complete work on the test by 2001, but it will be years
before a test might be commercially available to farmers.
</P>
<P>
	   With the kit, farmers could quickly and easily test for the disease and take
steps to replant the field with more soybean variety that is more resistant to
the disease, said Lynn Gray, a retired University of Illinois plant pathologist
who continues to guide research efforts in the area.
</P>
<P>
	   "This thing's real, real slow growing. It's hard to detect," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Grau, whose research focuses on what environmental factors lead to greater
incidence of soybean rot, said there is little likelihood of a treatment for the
disease in the near future.
</P>
<P>
	   But a rapid test would increase his lab's ability to check soybean plants
for resistance to the disease. That might make it easier for seed companies to
market strains more resistant to the stem rot.

    By HILLEL ITALIE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A former U.S. poet laureate, the latest winner of Britain's
Booker Prize and Argentina's most famous writer have been nominated for this
year's National Book Critics Circle awards.
</P>
<P>
	   Rita Dove, poet laureate from 1993 to 1995, was named a poetry finalist for
her collection "On the Bus With Rosa Parks." South African author J.M. Coetzee,
who recently won the Booker Prize for his post-apartheid novel "Disgrace," was
nominated for fiction.
</P>
<P>
	   The late Jorge Luis Borges was a finalist for criticism for his "Selected
Non-Fictions," which compiles everything from movie reviews to essays on Dante.
Borges, a native of Argentina known all over the world for his surreal stories
and parables, died in 1986.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the non-nominees: "Dutch," Edmund Morris' controversial biography of
former President Reagan, in which the author inserted himself as a fictional
character.
</P>
<P>
	   "We do not believe it represents the best of what biographies should be,"
NBCC president Barbara Hoffert said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   David Gates, a fiction nominee in 1999, was nominated this year for his
story collection "The Wonders of the Invisible World." Others cited were
Jonathan Lethem for "Motherless Brooklyn," Frederick Busch for "The Night
Inspector" and A. Manette Ansay for "Midnight Champagne."
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Caucuses Have Home on Cable TV  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Cable news viewers could be forgiven for thinking the Iowa
caucuses were the only thing going on in the world Monday night. And those tuned
to broadcast TV may have missed the story entirely.
</P>
<P>
	   CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC provided nonstop, prime-time coverage of the
2000 presidential campaign's first official contest, blanketing airtime with
sound bites, analysis and predictions.
</P>
<P>
	   The major broadcasters essentially stuck to game shows, movies and comedies,
interrupting only for quick political updates.
</P>
<P>
	   The contrast is consistent with a campaign so far waged largely on cable. A
study last week found that ABC, CBS and NBC evening news programs were spending
far less time on the presidential contest than they did four years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, this marks the first presidential primary season with
three competing cable news programs. Each has drawn strong ratings so far with
debates, and they treated Monday as opening day of their favorite season.
</P>
<P>
	   The cable networks used entrance polling to declare Vice President Al Gore
and Texas Gov. George W. Bush the winners, then struggled for secondary stories:
Did Republicans Steve Forbes and Alan Keyes exceed expectations? Is Bill Bradley
in an unrecoverable tailspin? Is Orrin Hatch out of the race before most
Americans knew he was in it?
</P>
<P>
	   On MSNBC, Lisa Myers noted that it's a game of survival for everyone but
Gore and Bush, who hope to essentially close out the campaign by next week's New
Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
	   With speculation about who could survive Iowa and who could not, CNN's Judy
Woodruff said, in effect, ``whoa.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't want to make it seem like the whole election's over with,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although analysts were good at reminding viewers that John McCain was
effectively not participating in the GOP caucus, there was little historical
context about Iowa's shaky record in picking eventual presidents.
</P>
<P>
	   The expectation game was in full swing, and often a little confusing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Where is the bar about what makes it a moral victory'' for Bradley, Fox
News Channel's Shepard Smith asked.
</P>
<P>
	   Wherever it was, he hadn't reached it, said CNN's Jeff Greenfield. ``There
ain't no way to spin that as anything but bad news for Bill Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
	   The much-traveled analyst Bill Kristol, who was canned from ABC's ``This
Week'' last month and has since shown up on CBS and NBC's Sunday morning
political talk shows, appeared Monday on Fox News Channel.
</P>
<P>
	   The broadcast stars -- Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings and Dan Rather -- all
anchored the evening news from Iowa. Sometimes it seemed their hearts weren't in
it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'll do our campaign duty and remind you what a caucus is,'' Jennings
said. The caucus was the third story on the ``CBS Evening News,'' after the
Cuban boy custody saga and Wall Street's woes.
</P>
<P>
	   When Rather was given a minute of network time at 8:27 p.m. EST, he spoke
fast as if a clock were ticking loudly in his earpiece.

<HEADLINE> Warring Sides in Congo Seek Peace  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- African leaders involved in Congo's war have pledged
to uphold a faltering cease-fire and work for peace, but they demanded the
United Nations also do its part by sending a peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States, which many see as the stumbling block to deployment, said
Monday it would support a peacekeeping force only if all sides make progress to
implement the cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   Talks on updating the 6-month-old accord were to continue today behind
closed doors, with consultations among Security Council members and a
mini-summit of a half-dozen African presidents led by Secretary-General Kofi
Annan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Africa will rise again, and peace will come to'' Congo, Namibian Foreign
Minister Theo-Ben Gurirab declared at the end of his speech to the extraordinary
reunion of African leaders gathered Monday in the Security Council chamber.
</P>
<P>
	   The war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has drawn in a half-dozen
African nations, with Uganda and Rwanda backing the rebels who rose up in arms
in August 1998 to oust Congolese President Laurent Kabila from power.
</P>
<P>
	   Kabila enlisted the support of Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia to fight a war
that has destabilized the entire Great Lakes region, killing untold numbers and
uprooting close to 1 million people from their homes.
</P>
<P>
	   The two sides signed the cease-fire agreement in Lusaka, Zambia, last July.
But fighting has continued, and deadlines in starting up joint committees have
been missed.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of his monthlong Africa initiative, U.S. Ambassador Richard
Holbrooke invited the leaders to New York to secure their pledges to the Lusaka
agreement and to update its timetables. No rebel groups, however, were
represented.
</P>
<P>
	   In his speech, Congolese President Laurent Kabila criticized the Security
Council for having allowed the conflict to go on for so long -- and for failing
to take action to remove the Rwandan and Ugandan troops from his country.
</P>
<P>
	   But he pledged to work for peace and establish a national dialogue inside
Congo, saying ``My government and I are looking for nothing more than peace and
security in the DRC and the Great Lakes region.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Lusaka agreement calls for the withdrawal of all foreign troops in
Congo, as well as for the United Nations to send in a peacekeeping force to
monitor the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, there are 79 U.N. military liaison officers in the region.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan recommended last week the force be increased to
5,500 men, including 500 military observers and 3,400 troops needed to protect
them. The next step would be a full-fledged peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
	   Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni acknowledged there was an enormous risk
and cost in setting up the mission, which U.N. officials estimate could require
25,000 peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But the cost of inaction, as witnessed in Rwanda, would be too ghastly,
more costly and morally repugnant,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told the African leaders that, if they
made progress in New York, she would work with the U.S. Congress to get speedy
approval for the force.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have learned much over the past decade about the do's and don'ts of
U.N. missions,'' she said. ``We must apply those lessons firmly and
realistically in this case. But we also must be resolute in our determination to
help the Congo move from war to peace.''
</P>
<P>
	   She may face an uphill battle. Last week, Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman
of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told U.N. ambassadors he wanted existing
international missions, such as those in Kosovo and Bosnia, to be strengthened
before the United Nations takes on any future peacekeeping responsibilities.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Address Nation Thursday  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A younger Bill Clinton's inclination toward late-night,
brainy exchanges with aides and advisers and an equal tendency to write a lot of
his own stuff meant that his first State of the Union address was very much a
skin-of-the-teeth affair.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I remember once they were typing it, like, an hour beforehand,'' said one
Clinton aide, recalling that the final version with the president's scribbled,
last-minute changes was rushed onto a computer disk, whisked across town to the
Capitol and popped into a TelePrompTer.
</P>
<P>
	   No word on what might have happened if the disk had failed.
</P>
<P>
	   Seven years later, things are much more organized for Clinton's final State
of the Union speech Thursday night. Most of the major themes and ideas were set
before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've had the general frame of the speech for some time,'' said deputy
White House spokesman Jake Siewert, who was among a small group of aides who
began work on the speech several months ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There will be changes -- burnishing, polishing -- right up to the
afternoon before, but it's minor stuff,'' said Don Baer, the president's former
chief speechwriter and still a regular adviser. ``It's a matter of presentation,
emphasis, et cetera. There's not a lot of last-minute, major things if they've
done their job right.''
</P>
<P>
	   Baer is among the advisers, Cabinet secretaries and outside scholars and
writers asked to submit a ``policy memo'' to the White House weeks or months
ahead of the speech. Often the memos are lengthy wish lists for what people from
very different worlds would like to hear in the president's address.
</P>
<P>
	   Sometimes the memos are political sops meant to flatter or appease one
constituency or another. More often they reflect the president's own reading
list or interests over the preceding year. Clinton reads every one, aides say.
</P>
<P>
	   The roughly hourlong speech is prepared in tandem with the fiscal 2001
budget proposal that Clinton will submit to Congress Feb. 7. Aides and Clinton
himself picked which among the spending requests to highlight in the speech.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of those have been leaked to reporters in recent weeks. Clinton also
has road-tested some major themes of the speech in appearances in New York,
Arizona and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   About a week ago, Clinton began practicing his delivery in the family
theater, a private screening room where small, changing audiences of aides
critique his lines. Speechwriters, advisers and the president himself tweak the
rhetorical riffs between practice runs.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, White House aides are figuring out theatrical details such
as who will be invited to watch the speech from the special VIP box in the House
chamber.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton still does a lot of the heavy lifting himself. In brainstorming
sessions, he grills aides about policy matters large and small -- in the process
reframing details of the speech.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You realize pretty quickly that he is the one person in the room who could
do everyone's job,'' said White House economic adviser Gene Sperling.
</P>
<P>
	   Domestic adviser Bruce Reed and Sperling, both longtime Clinton aides, acted
as the senior arbiters of domestic policy themes for the speech; an aide to
White House national security adviser Samuel Berger fine-tuned the foreign
policy and defense section.
</P>
<P>
	   Then, a team of four speechwriters knitted the whole thing together, with a
lot of input and rewriting from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To a great degree, the speech really is in his voice,'' Siewert said of
Clinton. ``It's his speech.''
</P>
<P>
	   This year, as in the past, the speech will blend specifics of the
president's agenda for the coming legislative year with general themes such as a
desire for improved race relations.
</P>
<P>
	   One major policy thrust and an accompanying slogan will likely emerge. Last
year it was ``Save Social Security First,'' a catchy phrase Clinton coined out
of a longer version suggested by advisers, an aide said.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides say Clinton loves preparing for the speech -- relishes the opportunity
to think big and talk long. Last year, his speech ran 77 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton and his aides are poignantly aware that this could be his last
opportunity to speak at length directly to a large audience of Americans. It
also is an opportunity to impress writers, reporters and others who will have a
say in how the whole eight-year Clinton presidency is judged.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This will be the big canvas upon which he wants people to view his
legacy,'' said Leonard Steinhorn, an American University government professor.
``It really is his last shot to speak with the American people as the center of
political attention.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Weighs in on Elians's Case  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An election-year Congress is entering the festering
debate over Elian Gonzalez's future, as legislation to declare the 6-year-old
Cuban refugee a U.S. citizen draws support in both chambers.
</P>
<P>
	   Adding to the drama, Elian's two grandmothers scheduled meetings with
lawmakers here today to press their case that the boy should be returned to his
homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   Versions of the citizenship bill were formally introduced Monday in both the
House and the Senate, and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told his
colleagues they might debate the measure as early as Wednesday. A vote Wednesday
was possible, but both sides said they doubted final action would occur until
next week at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
	   At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart declined to say what President
Clinton would do if Congress passed the bill -- sign it or veto it -- but said
the White House would consider the matter after Congress acts. The president has
indicated he does not believe Congress should get involved.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a real danger here that this can become a political issue, that
this young boy will be a political football,'' Lockhart said. ``And I think the
president has made it very clear to everyone that they ought to stay away from
politics here and stick to what the facts and the law dictate.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the House, rival but unbinding legislation was introduced urging that
Elian be repatriated with his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is time to put an end to his ordeal by reuniting him with his family
and his grandparents in Cuba,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., senior
Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders of both parties struggled to find a consensus, which did not exist
Monday, as lawmakers returned to work from their long winter break.
</P>
<P>
	   Both parties scheduled meetings today to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides to Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., a sponsor of legislation to end the
40-year-old trade embargo with Cuba, said Elian's grandmothers, visiting from
Cuba, planned to meet with Dodd this afternoon. They also were meeting with Rep.
Joseph Moakley, D-Mass., who believes the boy should be returned to his father,
Moakley's office said.
</P>
<P>
	   The two women flew here on Monday night by private jet after their attempt
to visit the boy in Miami failed. The boy's maternal grandmother, Raquel
Rodriguez, and paternal grandmother, Mariela Quintana, shunned an invitation to
have dinner Monday night at the home of Elian's relatives in Miami, who insisted
the meeting take place there. The grandmothers wanted to meet privately with
Elian at a neutral site.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of Elian's Miami relatives were planning to travel to Washington as
well.
</P>
<P>
	   Lott and a group of Florida lawmakers put in motion the process to bestow
citizenship on the boy, who has been cared for by the Miami relatives since he
was found clinging to an inner tube off the Florida coast on Nov. 25. His mother
and 10 other Cubans died in their ill-fated attempt to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Sponsors hoped to whisk the citizenship bill through Congress quickly,
largely to remove the case from jurisdiction of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, which has ruled that the boy should be returned to his
father on the island. Passage of the citizenship legislation also would render
moot a federal court appeal of the INS ruling by Elian's great-uncle in Miami,
sponsors said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This moves the decision-making out of the hands of the INS and into the
hands of the (state) courts,'' said Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., the measure's
chief Senate sponsor.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the Senate Judiciary Committee's top
Democrat, denounced the bill.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For the Congress to grant citizenship to a young boy over the father's
objection makes a mockery of family values and it hands Castro yet another
reason to portray the United States as the enemy,'' Leahy said. Cuban President
Fidel Castro's government has sponsored a series of mass demonstrations
demanding the boy's repatriation.
</P>
<P>
	   Bestowing American citizenship is a power Congress uses rarely.
</P>
<P>
	   It gave citizenship to Winston Churchill and Mother Teresa and posthumously
to Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat who saved tens of thousands of Hungarian
Jews in World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   But congressional involvement in individual immigration cases has declined
sharply in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
	   Some high-profile examples:
</P>
<P>
	   --In July 1997, Swiss bank guard Christoph Meili won permanent residency
status. He had lost his job after saving Holocaust-era bank documents from a
shredder.
</P>
<P>
	   --In 1968, three men -- from Italy, Ireland and Germany -- who died while
fighting with American units in Vietnam, posthumously received U.S. citizenship.
</P>
<P>
	   --In 1988, Michael Wilding, the son of actress Elizabeth Taylor and a former
stepson of Sen. John Warner, R-Va., won citizenship. The British subject had
renounced his U.S. citizenship in 1971, and the bill blocked a possible
deportation on a marijuana possession conviction.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Homeless Program Criticized  </HEADLINE>
   By ESTES THOMPSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- This quaint North Carolina village known for hosting
one of the nation's premier golfing events is balking at hosting something else
-- the homeless.
</P>
<P>
	   Some residents of Pinehurst object to a church-led plan to offer temporary
shelter to homeless families in the midst of their sedate golfing and retirement
community of 8,000.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't have a problem with the homeless,'' said Linda Cox, a
businesswoman and leader of a petition drive against the proposed shelters.
``I'm against putting a shelter in a residential neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pinehurst, which hosted the 1999 U.S. Open golf tournament and has been
tapped to host the 2005 competition, is one of the state's wealthiest
communities. Retirees live in homes surrounded by hedges, brick walls or white
picket fences.
</P>
<P>
	   The dispute began when two churches located across the street from the
gold-domed Pinehurst Hotel and Country Club offered to house up to 14 people a
week for about four weeks a year.
</P>
<P>
	   The candidates would be families with children who were screened to weed out
derelicts, drunks and drug addicts, said officials at the churches, the
Community Presbyterian Church and the Village Chapel.
</P>
<P>
	   But what started as an attempt to provide emergency housing for needy
families has evolved into a battle over how exclusive Pinehurst should remain.
</P>
<P>
	   Known for its contoured, humpback greens, the 97-year-old Pinehurst golf
club is a jewel of the county, attracting wealthy businessmen and sports fans
alike.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 60 percent of the county's tourist trade is tied directly to the golf,
according to Caleb Miles, chief executive of the Moore County tourist bureau.
Hosting the 1999 Open was expected to generate $40 million in revenue for the
area.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Ben Bishop, senior pastor at Community Presbyterian and himself a
Pinehurst Country Club member, said he well knows the village's atmosphere of
privilege and wealth.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You go five miles in either direction, and you're in the poor areas of
eastern North Carolina,'' Bishop said. ``We are an enclave.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bishop said housing the homeless is part of the Christian mission. The
village government shouldn't interfere with church activities, he said, except
to ensure safety.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents fear that offering transients places to stay -- however temporary
-- might be followed by begging or violence, destroying the area's quality of
life.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it's just ignorance in general,'' said Laticia Erwin, 30, as she
snuggled her 2-month-old son, Devonte, at the day center of a shelter in nearby
Aberdeen.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Erwin, a four-year Marine Corps veteran, left her baby's father and has
been relying on church-organized housing while she prepares to become a
paralegal.
</P>
<P>
	   The controversy over the homeless comes down to zoning. The town planner
notified the churches in September that the shelters would violate the
community's zoning ordinance for residential areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents now want to amend that ordinance to specifically exclude shelters
in residential zones. The churches contend the ordinance allows churches all
uses.
</P>
<P>
	   The hearing before the Village Council was scheduled for tonight.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Cox, who lives around the corner from Bishop's church, said the
proposal would devalue property around the churches ``for a problem that's
nonexistent. There aren't any homeless here.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Pam Stewart, a 27-year-old Pinehurst native who works as an aide at a
senior citizens' home, has been without shelter since Dec. 28 when her landlord
evicted her from a mobile home in neighboring Richmond County.
</P>
<P>
	   She said church assistance has helped her keep her two sons warm and safe,
first in a motel and later in the churches after she was accepted into the
residential program.
</P>
<P>
	   Without the help, she said, ``I would probably be out on the streets.''

Bush, Gore Win Iowa Presidential Caucuses

<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Republican George W. Bush scored a
closer-than-expected victory Monday night in the Iowa presidential caucuses,
besting Steve Forbes to set the stage for a high-stakes three-way race in the
New Hampshire primary. Democrats gave Al Gore a big win over Bill Bradley who
said he had "a little more humility" and vowed to push his challenge. "I can't
wait to get to New Hampshire," was Gore's battle cry and he said he'd be
campaigning Tuesday at dawn. Bush described the caucus results as validation of
his compassionate conservative agenda. The Texas governor roused supporters with
the vow, "tonight is the beginning of the end of the Clinton era."

Davidian case after raising questions about a possible government cover-up is
resigning, saying Justice Department leaders have been "less than forthright."
U.S. Attorney Bill Johnston said he is leaving his job as chief federal
prosecutor in Waco in two weeks to practice civil law. While he said he needed a
break, he also referred to the Davidian controversy. "There's no secret I've
been frustrated by the Department of Justice," Johnston said in Tuesday's Waco
Tribune-Herald.

Falwell Sues White House, FBI

<P>
	   LYNCHBURG, Va. (AP) -- The Rev. Jerry Falwell has sued the White House and
the FBI for denying a request for information about him that he contends is kept
in a "secret" Justice Department database about religious and anti-abortion
leaders. Falwell sought the information last summer under the Freedom of
Information Act after being told of the alleged database by Judicial Watch, a
conservative Washington group that said it learned of the material through an
anonymous source. Falwell contends that keeping information about him in the
database is a violation of the Privacy Act, which makes it illegal for the
government to keep a file on a person without a lawful reason.

White House Backs Geothermal Energy
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration hopes to spur the growth of
the fledgling geothermal energy industry with $4.8 million in research grants.
Despite its abundance, geothermal energy has so far failed to capture much of
the electricity market. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson announced the modest
series of grants Monday for research aimed at finding and producing the
electricity more cheaply. Geothermal energy is generated from water or steam
heated by the earth's magma. The process pollutes less than gasoline or even
natural gas typically used to generate electricity.

<HEADLINE> New Health Plan by Surgeon General  </HEADLINE>
   By KAREN GULLO Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The surgeon general is unveiling a 10-year health plan
for America that won't be popular with couch potatoes, particularly kids who'd
rather play computer video games than shoot baskets or run track.
</P>
<P>
	   It focuses on whipping kids into better shape, getting people to quit
smoking, cutting drug use and pushing teens to either abstain from sex or use
condoms.
</P>
<P>
	   Surgeon General David Satcher's blueprint aims for 30 percent of Americans
to exercise 30 minutes each day -- today only 15 percent of the population does
-- and reduce by half the number of overweight or obese children, which now
stands at about 11 percent of kids.
</P>
<P>
	   To get there, the surgeon general will begin measuring 10 areas -- called
``leading health indicators'' -- that address a broad range of health and, one
might argue, social concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to working on traditional health goals such as increasing the
number of kids getting vaccinated and persuading people to exercise more, the
surgeon general's Healthy People 2010 program will target depression, substance
abuse, sexual behavior, homicides, access to health insurance and even fatal car
crashes.
</P>
<P>
	   These categories have a direct effect on the health of Americans, Satcher
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The underlying premise of Healthy People 2010 is that the health of the
individual is inseparable from the health of the larger community,'' Satcher
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The new program is the first to establish a set of measurements. The surgeon
general's office will collect data from state and local health agencies and from
federal agencies that compile health statistics to track each year whether
Americans are reaching goals set by the program in the 10 areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Tracking 10 indicators is the cornerstone for another goal for the surgeon
general: eliminating racial disparities in health by 2010, an idea introduced by
President Clinton last year. The health program will emphasize prevention and
early intervention initiatives run by local public health agencies, community
groups, churches and schools.
</P>
<P>
	   Americans of all racial and ethnic groups are healthier than they were a
decade ago, but considerable disparities exist among whites and other races:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Black infants are twice as likely to die in the first year of life as
white infants. American Indian babies are one a half times as likely not to make
it through the first year.
</P>
<P>
	   -- White women are more likely to contract breast cancer, but black women
who get the disease are more likely to die from it.
</P>
<P>
	   -- The incidence of diabetes in American Indian tribes is three to five
times the national average.
</P>
<P>
	   Other goals of Healthy People 2010:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Reduce cigarette smoking by adolescents.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Reduce the number or adults and kids using drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Reduce binge drinking among adults.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Get adults into depression treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Reduce deaths from automobile accidents.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Reduce the number of nonsmokers exposed to secondhand smoke.

<HEADLINE> Police say they've nabbed Soccer Guy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Scams are easy to come by in New York City, where
three-card monte is still a booming business.
<P>
	   But now cops have come across a scam even seasoned veterans hadn't seen. For
months, Japanese men - tourists and residents - kept reporting that they had
been robbed by a man who demonstrated soccer moves on them.
</P>
<P>
	   The robber's fascinating footwork was enough to distract even the most
discerning person long enough for the suspect to grab his wallet and then walk
away.
</P>
<P>
	   But on Sunday, police say they nabbed their man, nicknamed the Soccer Guy.
</P>
<P>
	   Sgt. James Molloy of the New York Police Department's Grand Larceny Unit
said Monday he was one of two cops who witnessed the scofflaw doing his soccer
moves - kicking around the shins, a bump here, a bump there - in front of a
midtown Manhattan hotel.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not a soccer fan, but he was very convincing," Molloy said. "He looked
pretty apt on his feet."
</P>
<P>
	   Molloy said since last October, 15 or 16 men have reported being victims of
the Soccer Guy, but he believes there are many more.
</P>
<P>
	   Hirofumi Murabayashi, a spokesman for the Japanese Consulate's office here,
said his office has received several complaints from Japanese men about the
scam.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a new kind of crime targeting Japanese nationals," he said. "We
would like to call the attention of the Japanese community here to this in case
of similar crimes."
</P>
<P>
	   According to Molloy, Soccer Guy worked mostly around midtown Manhattan
hotels - 45th to 50th streets, between Broadway and Madison Avenue, sometimes
venturing up to Central Park South.
</P>
<P>
	   "He would approach Japanese males and asked them certain questions, like
'Where's Fifth Avenue?"' Molloy said.
</P>
<P>
	   This was apparently to see if the men spoke English, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   If the victims got drawn into a conversation, the suspect pulled out a
telephone calling card with a picture of popular soccer star Hidetoshi Nakata on
one side. Nakata, who plays for the Italian soccer team AS Roma, is a huge icon
in both Italy and Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   Then the soccer moves would begin - without a ball.
</P>
<P>
	   "He would pretend like he was playing soccer, kicking around their shins,
circling, bumping, circling, bumping, all the while feeling where they kept
their wallets," Molloy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Once the suspect had the wallet, he would casually walk away into the
midtown crowds. Police did not say how much money was taken, but victims
reported that any credit cards in their wallets were maxed out, Molloy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Molloy and Officer Tito Ramos, aware of reports about Soccer Guy, happened
upon the suspect as they were walking near the Hilton Hotel in midtown Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   "We observed an individual literally dancing around - he actually placed his
hand inside this individual's pocket, but the complainant pushed him away,"
Molloy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Molloy and Ramos followed the suspect as he got into the passenger side of a
waiting car. Ramos ordered the suspect out of the car; he ran into a nearby
subway entrance, then out the other end, where Ramos nabbed him. The driver sped
away and is being sought for questioning.
</P>
<P>
	   The suspect was identified by four victims at lineups, Molloy said.
Identified as Ben-Msyly Gil-Elie, 29, of Astoria, Queens, he faced misdemeanor
charges of attempted grand larceny, resisting arrest and jostling, a legal term
used to describe the act of trying to distract someone in order to pick his
pocket.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Governor Faces Corruption Trial  </HEADLINE>
   By NATALIE GOTT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Former Gov. Edwin Edwards has a reputation as of a
smooth talker, but his words may come back to haunt him as he attempts to defend
himself against federal corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors cite more than 1,500 hours of secretly recorded conversations
between Edwards and associates that they say will back up allegations that he
manipulated the state's riverboat casino licensing process.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards, 72, faces up to 350 years in prison and $7.2 million in fines if
convicted. Opening statements were scheduled for today.
</P>
<P>
	   The former governor, who has avoided convictions in two previous federal
racketeering trials, sounded confident as he left court on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They have not made a prosecutor yet who could ambush me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards, a charismatic high-rolling gambler and a four-term governor, is
charged with manipulating the riverboat casino licensing process and accepting
payoffs from friends and cronies seeking casino licenses.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to Edwards, his son, Stephen, state Sen. Greg Tarver and four
others are also on trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Former San Francisco 49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo and two others have already
pleaded guilty in connection with the case, and DeBartolo has agreed to testify
for the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities say the evidence against Edwards this time is stronger than in
the 1980s, when he was tried on federal racketeering charges involving a
hospital and nursing home venture. The first trial ended in a hung jury and the
second in an acquittal.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors say the casino schemes occurred after Edwards was out of office
in 1991, continued through his fourth and final term as governor from 1992 to
1996, and went on after he left office again but retained considerable political
clout.
</P>
<P>
	   The case came to light in April 1997, when FBI agents raided his home and
office and seized records and more than $400,000 in cash.
</P>
<P>
	   The money allegedly came from DeBartolo. He pleaded guilty to failing to
report a crime and was sentenced to two years' probation. His DeBartolo
Entertainment was seeking a riverboat license.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, a jury consisting of eight men and four women was seated for the
trial. Edwards was pleased with the final selection.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We feel like we have a fair and impartial jury,'' Edwards said. ``They
will do a good job.''

<HEADLINE> HMOs Dispute Black Doctors' Charges  </HEADLINE>
    By PAUL SHEPARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's managed health care industry rejected
charges raised by black doctors that HMOs systematically exclude them and reduce
black patients' chances of selecting physicians of similar racial backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, independent studies of the situation do not support the black doctors'
claims of racial discrimination in the hiring of HMO doctors.
</P>
<P>
	   "The argument that we would exclude black doctors makes no sense. We recruit
physicians to serve plan members. That's business we would lose if we excluded
doctors that patients want to see," said Charles M. Cutler, chief medical
officer of the American Association of Health Plans. The association represents
1,000 health maintenance organizations nationally.
</P>
<P>
	   Cutler's comments came in response to a news conference held Monday by
leaders of the National Medical Association, the nation's largest organization
of black doctors. Without citing specifics, the physicians said HMOs routinely
reject their applications for admission.
</P>
<P>
	   "This practice is not only racist but ultimately compromises patient care,"
said Dr. Gary C. Dennis, past president of the association, which represents
25,000 black physicians. "Patients feel more involved in their health-care
decisions when they receive care from doctors of a similar race."
</P>
<P>
	   A University of California, San Francisco, study published in the March 4,
1998, Journal of American Medicine showed that nonwhite doctors were no more
likely than white doctors to be denied or terminated from HMO contracts.
</P>
<P>
	   The study also showed that as many or more nonwhite doctors participated in
HMOs than white doctors. The study covered 13 large urban counties in
California.
</P>
<P>
	   Thirteen black doctors at the news conference acknowledged they have little
more than anecdotal evidence of any widespread move by HMOs to keep them out.
But they said they hope greater public awareness will fuel further research and
documentation of what they see as a dearth of black professionals in the health
maintenance industry.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Walter Shervington, chief executive officer at the New Orleans
Adolescent Hospital and current president of the National Medical Association,
likened the situation to that of blacks activists who insisted for decades that
police officers pulled over black drivers at disproportionately high rates.
</P>
<P>
	   Those complaints led to studies by the Justice Department and other
government agencies that confirmed in some jurisdictions the practice of police
harassment of black drivers.
</P>
<P>
	   HMO spokesman Cutler said problems of a racial nature may exist, but if so
they don't stem from discrimination by HMOs.
</P>
<P>
	   Cutler said the percentage of black doctors in America is dwarfed by the
percentage of blacks in the general population. That disparity, he said, might
give the impression that HMOs exclude blacks.
</P>
<P>
	   About 4 percent of the nation's 700,000 practicing physicians are black,
according to figures from the American Medical Association and the National
Medical Association. Blacks comprise about 12 percent of the U.S. population.
</P>
<P>
	   "Frankly we were taken aback by the news conference this morning, because we
don't understand why anyone would think managed care organizations would do
this," Cutler said. "We need a diverse network of providers because people want
doctors who can relate well to them."
</P>
<P>
	   He said he'd be happy to talk with the National Medical Association about
the matter but added: "It does not seem to be a problem of substance. It's more
a problem of perception."
</P>
<P>
	   An official of the health care organization said her group was preparing a
letter to the National Medical Association to meet and discuss the issue.

<HEADLINE> Standoff in Thai Hospital Ends  </HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW PENNINGTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RATCHABURI, Thailand (AP) -- Ending a 22-hour standoff, Thai security forces
stormed a hospital Tuesday and killed ten Myanmar rebels who had held hundreds
of patients, visitors and staff hostage.
</P>
<P>
	   The approximately 900 people who were in the walled, six-acre compound when
the ordeal began Monday morning were either freed, had escaped or were rescued
during the siege early Tuesday, said Lt. Gen. Thaweep Suwannasingha, regional
Thai army commander.
</P>
<P>
	   No hostages were injured, but two police officers were.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a successful operation,'' Thaweep said.
</P>
<P>
	   Once Thai troops secured the front of the hospital, a fleet of ambulances
drove in and began ferrying exhausted survivors -- some weeping -- to another
hospital for medical checks.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels belong to God's Army, a fringe group who took the hostages to
pressure the government to help their beleaguered movement.
</P>
<P>
	   The group is from the ethnic Karen minority and is led by twin 12-year-old
boys believed to have magical powers. The twins were not involved in the
takeover.
</P>
<P>
	   Like many Karens, the followers of God's Army are fundamentalist Christians
in a predominantly Buddhist country. They accuse Myanmar's military regime of
widespread murder, rape and arson.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said early Tuesday that nine gunmen had been killed and one was
believed missing. Thaweep discounted earlier reports that there had been 16
gunmen.
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Gen. Anant Heamathanong later said nine of the rebels had died at the
scene and the tenth was killed in a gun battle after fleeing. Ten bodies wrapped
in white cloth were dumped in front of a hospital building to be displayed to
the media.
</P>
<P>
	   Once the siege began, shooting erupted and police and soldiers armed with
M-16 assault rifles on foot and in trucks sped into the walled, six-acre
hospital compound.
</P>
<P>
	   Automatic weapons fire and explosions thudded in the night, possibly from
grenades, bombs or mines that the rebels had rigged around the hospital. The
pre-dawn assault lasted for an hour.
</P>
<P>
	   After the area was secured, explosives experts with mine detectors combed
the compound seeking booby-traps.
</P>
<P>
	   The hostage-takers had been in control of the five-story central
administration and emergency room buildings, but couldn't keep a grip over eight
outlying buildings. Many patients and staff there escaped Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   It was never known how many people they held at gunpoint during the siege,
though officials guessed it might have been 200.
</P>
<P>
	   The hostage-takers included at least one member of a faction of exiled
Myanmar students, the Vigorous Burmese Student Warriors, who seized their
country's embassy in Bangkok last year, said Interior Minister Sanan
Kachornprasart.
</P>
<P>
	   Myanmar's military regime was outraged when Thailand allowed the embassy
captors, whom they considered terrorists, to go free under a deal to release
their dozens of hostages unharmed.
</P>
<P>
	   Myanmar closed the border for two months in retaliation. Relations warmed
after Thailand vowed to arrest them if it got the chance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We tried the soft way before,'' Thaweep said Tuesday, explaining the
decision to launch the assault. ``We were concerned about patients in the
hospital and other innocent people. We had to do it.''
</P>
<P>
	   The students, who said they were fighting for democracy against a military
dictatorship that has ruled their country, also known as Burma, had holed up
with God's Army.
</P>
<P>
	   The groups came under attack inside Myanmar from government forces last week
in fighting that has driven 1,000 refugees into Thailand. Thai forces shelled
their positions to deter rebels from coming across.
</P>
<P>
	   The hostage-takers demanded Monday that Thailand grant refuge to civilians
and combatants and stop shelling their positions.
</P>
<P>
	   The episode began early Monday when the rebels hijacked a bus near the
border and forced the driver to take them 45 miles to Ratchaburi, where they
took over the sprawling provincial hospital compound.

<HEADLINE> Court To Rule on Campaign Spending  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Supreme Court decision reaffirming state authority to
limit individual campaign contributions has given new vigor to congressional
efforts to pass broad changes in campaign spending rules.
</P>
<P>
	   But proponents of banning large, unrestricted donations known as ``soft
money'' and other measures to rein in campaign spending still face an uphill
fight: The legislation is particularly touchy in an election year and is
strongly opposed by Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision Monday, reinstated Missouri's $1,075
cap on individual contributions to candidates for federal office. It was the
first time the high court had ruled on contribution limits since 1976.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Marty Meehan, D-Mass., who has joined with Republican Rep. Chris Shays
of Connecticut in authoring House campaign finance reform, called the decision a
``major victory.'' He said the decision ``puts to rest the myth that campaign
contributions limits are unconstitutional.''
</P>
<P>
	   The court has agreed, Shays said, that ``unlimited campaign contributions
distort the political process.''
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998 and again last year, Shays and Meehan succeeded in winning House
passage of legislation to ban ``soft money,'' the large sum donations made to
political parties by corporations and unions, and put curbs on ``issue ads''
which sometimes sharply criticize a candidate without directly advocating his
defeat.
</P>
<P>
	   But similar legislation proposed by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Russ
Feingold, D-Wis., has never been able to gain the 60 votes needed to cut off
debate in the Senate, even last year when McCain narrowed the bill to cover only
``soft money.''
</P>
<P>
	   Feingold, in an interview, said supporters are only five votes away from the
60-vote plateau and the court decision ``can change the dynamics'' by bringing
on board those senators who have opposed the bill on constitutional grounds.
``It doesn't take much to change the momentum.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republican leaders and other opponents have argued that limiting
contributions to campaigns violates constitutional rights to free speech.
Republicans, including top presidential contender George W. Bush, also assert
that the bills would hurt their party, which traditionally raises more than the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   Campaign finance is one issue that has sharply divided Bush and McCain, his
chief rival for the GOP presidential nomination, in candidate debates.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who heads the GOP Senate election committee and
is the body's leading foe of campaign finance bills, asserted that the Supreme
Court ruling was a ``narrow decision'' that ``had absolutely nothing to do with
soft money or contributions to political parties.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the court made clear that limits on contributions will be struck
down when they impede effective communication of a candidate's message.
</P>
<P>
	   The court ruled that fighting corruption, or even the perception of
corruption, justifies contribution limits. The three dissenters -- Justices
Anthony M. Kennedy, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas -- argued that the
decision trampled free-speech rights.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton, who has been a strong backer of the Shays-Meehan and
McCain-Feingold bills, hailed the court decision as a ``victory for democracy,''
saying in a statement that ``the American people know that our political system
needs to be fixed, and today's decision sets that stage for further reform.''

<HEADLINE> GOP, Democrats To Duel on Surplus  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An unusual decision by Congress' top budget analyst to
produce three separate surplus estimates is touching off an election-year battle
between Democrats and Republicans over how much black ink there will be.
</P>
<P>
	   Dan Crippen, director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, is
expected to release three surplus projections for the coming decade on
Wednesday. The figure Congress ultimately chooses will determine how much money
is available for tax cuts, spending increases and debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats are expected to embrace the smallest of three projections. That
total, for the 10 years ending 2010, will be roughly $1 trillion excluding
Social Security, say congressional aides speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans have not decided what to do, but many of them -- including
Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M. -- seem likely to endorse
a projection totaling about $2 trillion over the period, aides said. That is
about double what CBO projected last year, a figure that has grown because of
the persistently strong economy.
</P>
<P>
	   CBO will also release a third projection which, though arrived at
differently, also foresees about $2 trillion in black ink, aides said.
</P>
<P>
	   It is unusual for CBO to produce multiple surplus estimates without
endorsing one as the figure it believes most valid. CBO's decision to release
three projections highlights the immense political pressure on the agency as the
two parties vie over rival visions of how to use the government's projected
extra cash.
</P>
<P>
	   The figure Democrats like assumes that the one-third of the $1.7 trillion
federal budget that Congress must approve every year will grow annually at the
rate of inflation. That one-third of the budget covers everything but
automatically paid benefits like Social Security and interest on the federal
debt.
</P>
<P>
	   That option assumes the most spending -- with less money left over for the
GOP's proposed tax cuts -- than any of CBO's alternatives. It also most nearly
approaches what has actually happened in recent years, as lawmakers have
consistently increased spending for defense and many domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The number many Republicans like assumes that the money spent on that
one-third of the budget will remain frozen at roughly $620 billion, about what
is being spent this year. It assumes less spending than Democrats would like,
with more money left over for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   The third option assumes that spending limits on this portion of the budget
will be obeyed. These limits have been surpassed for the past two years by tens
of billions of dollars annually, and are virtually certain to be ignored again
this coming year. This calculation assumes bigger surpluses for the next few
years, but smaller surpluses in later years than the assumption Republicans will
use.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Republicans like the second option because it allows room for big tax
cuts over the decade, but does not make the unrealistic assumption that the
spending limits will be obeyed.
</P>
<P>
	   In the fiscal 2001 budget he introduces next month, President Clinton is
expected to embrace a surplus estimate that is a bit more generous than the $1
trillion figure congressional Democrats are expected to use.

<HEADLINE> Study Finds Small Market for Hemp  </HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government says there is little future in growing
industrial hemp even if federal drug agencies were to relent and legalize its
production.
</P>
<P>
	   Hemp, the non-halluciogenic cousin of marijuana, can be used for both
clothing and food, but there would only be a ``small, thin market'' for the
crop, according to a study by the Agriculture Department's Economic Research
Service.
</P>
<P>
	   All of the hemp fiber, yarn and fabric that the United States currently
imports could be grown on less than 2,000 acres of land, the study says.
</P>
<P>
	   The study is a blow to efforts by farmers in a number of states to get the
federal government to legalize production of industrial hemp. The Drug
Enforcement Administration and the White House drug policy office say that
legalizing hemp farming would make it more difficult to control marijuana
production.
</P>
<P>
	   Nine states -- Arkansas, California, Hawaii, Illinois, Minnesota, Montana,
New Mexico, North Dakota and Virginia -- passed pro-hemp bills last year that
provide for research, study or potential production of the crop, and the first
U.S. test plots were planted in Hawaii last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 35,000 acres were grown last year in Canada, which legalized hemp
production in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Hemp supporters say that new uses and markets for the crop will develop once
it is clear to investors and companies that there will be a supply available.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's like soybeans 30 years ago,'' Gale Glenn, a retired tobacco grower
who is vice chairwoman of the North American Industrial Hemp Council, said
Monday. ``The markets will grow, but the markets aren't going to grow until they
have the raw material.''
</P>
<P>
	   The USDA study doesn't foresee see much demand for any of hemp's uses:
</P>
<P>
	   --As a fiber, it's main competitor is linen, which is made from flax. There
is little textile flax production in the United States, despite the lack of
legal barriers, and that suggests there wouldn't be enough demand for hemp fiber
to make it profitable, the study said.
</P>
<P>
	   --Hemp seeds and flour are being added to nutrition bars, tortilla chips and
other food items. USDA says that will probably remain a small use, comparable to
the market for sesame and poppy seeds.
</P>
<P>
	   --As for hemp oil, it can't be used for frying, it has a short shelf life,
and it hasn't been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a salad oil.
Hemp oil is currently used in lotions, shampoo and other body-care products and
also is sold as a nutritional supplement.
</P>
<P>
	   With such limited markets, farmers run the risk of quickly overproducing the
crop and driving down prices, the study said, citing among other things the
collapse several years ago in the market for emu meat.

<HEADLINE> ABC's Iger Named No. 2 at Disney  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL WHITE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- Michael Eisner is getting some help at the Walt
Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
	   Eisner on Monday named ABC chief Robert Iger as his second-in-command and
promoted two other top executives in moves expected to ease investor concerns
about months of sagging stock prices and a parade of high-level executive
departures.
</P>
<P>
	   The management changes, plus the announcement of a 7 percent jump in
first-quarter earnings, won the applause of Wall Street analysts, who said the
company showed signs of a long-awaited rebound.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the beginning of a turnaround," said Jessica Reif Cohen, an analyst
with Merrill Lynch. "We expect modest improvements for the rest of the year."
</P>
<P>
	   Iger, 48, was named president of Disney, filling a vacancy that had been
left open since Michael Ovitz left the job in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   "Disney for some time has needed a strong No. 2 person to make sure the
trains are running on time," said Tom Wolzien, analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein
&AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Eisner also announced the promotion of chief strategic officer Peter Murphy
and chief financial officer Thomas O. Staggs to senior executive vice
presidents.
</P>
<P>
	   They will become members of a new executive management committee that will
include Eisner, Iger, Disney vice chairman Sanford M. Litvack and heads of
individual business units.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney also released a preview of first quarter results that showed net
income rose 7 percent to $515 million, or 25 cents per share, excluding its
Go.com Internet business. Official results will be released in February.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney announced in November that it planned to issue a separate stock for
Go.com, which is expected to yield a "substantial loss" in the first quarter due
to the cost of acquiring the Internet company Infoseek.
</P>
<P>
	   "There definitely are some major signs that things are working Disney's
way," said Jill Krutick, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a very savvy move by Michael Eisner solidify his management team.
Clearly the demands of shaping a major media company in today's world had become
an increasingly challenging task, although we think Eisner's really a
well-rounded, high-caliber executive."
</P>
<P>
	   She noted, however, that the company still has problems, including weak
sales in its merchandising unit.
</P>
<P>
	   The earnings increase exceeded Wall Street expectations and reflected the
strong performance of ABC, which benefited from better ad sales and the
popularity of the game show "Who Wants to be a Millionaire." Ad sales rose to a
record $1 billion during the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Disney rose 31 1/4 cents to $33.12 1/2 in trading on the New York
Stock Exchange before the news. That compares to a high of $41.50 1/64 hit in
April of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Iger previously was chairman of Disney's ABC Group, which included ABC, ESPN
and other properties, and president of Walt Disney International.
</P>
<P>
	   He joined Disney when the company acquired Capital Cities/ABC in 1996. He
went to work for ABC in 1974 and spent 12 years with ABC sports. Iger had been
named to become Capital Cities/ABC's chief executive officer when Disney
purchased the company.
</P>
<P>
	   Eisner credited Iger with supervising ABC's recent success.
</P>
<P>
	   "He has overseen the ABC Television Network's turnaround," Eisner said. "At
the same time, Bob has spearheaded the reorganization of our company's
international efforts. ... As a result, our entire company is now poised for
growth in the opportunity-laden overseas markets."
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement follows the departure last week of Disney studio chief Joe
Roth, who quit to start his own film company.
</P>
<P>
	   Roth was the latest in a string of top executives to leave the company.
Others to leave in recent years include chief financial officers Steve
Bollenbach and Richard Nanula, ABC TV and radio station chief Steve Burke, and
cable programming boss Geraldine Laybourne.
</P>
<P>
	   Finding someone to fill the president's job has been an issue since the 1994
death of Eisner's longtime friend and trusted second-in-command, Frank Wells.
Wells, who died in a helicopter accident, was widely credited with handling the
day-to-day details of running Disney, freeing Eisner to focus on creative
development and long-range plans.
</P>
<P>
	   As Disney's share price has lagged, board members reportedly have pressed
Eisner to get help.
</P>
<P>
	   "They have great conceptual management at the top, but a company as vast as
Disney needs somebody to make sure everybody's talking on a day-to-day basis,"
said analyst Wolzien.

<HEADLINE> Publishers Clearing House Sued  </HEADLINE>
    By ASHLEY H. GRANT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. PAUL (AP) -- Minnesota and 24 other states have filed separate lawsuits
against Publishers Clearing House, claiming false advertising by the sweepstakes
giant that sends its "Prize Patrol" minivan out on Super Bowl Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Publishers Clearing House's deceptive sweepstakes solicitations are
designed to convince consumers that they are on the verge of winning big and
that additional orders of magazines or goods are needed to improve their chances
of winning," Minnesota Attorney General Mike Hatch said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Port Washington, N.Y.-based company also misrepresents that it has a
"personal relationship with consumers" and induces people into believing that
they are guaranteed winners of multimillion dollar prizes, when they were
winners of $1 or costume jewelry, according to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   Christopher L. Irving, director of consumer affairs at Publishers Clearing
House of Port Washington, N.Y., denied the allegations and said the majority of
people who return their sweepstakes entries do so without ordering.
</P>
<P>
	   "The majority of our millionaire winners, 23 of 30, did not order with their
winning entry," Irving said.
</P>
<P>
	   Suing Monday were Colorado, New York, North Carolina, New Jersey, Illinois,
Ohio, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Vermont, Oregon, Pennsylvania, West Virginia,
Louisiana, Georgia and California. Similar complaints already had been filed in
nine states.
</P>
<P>
	   Hatch's office was contacted by more than 240 people about what they
considered deceptive practices by Publishers Clearing House. The lawsuit, filed
in Ramsey County District Court, seeks injunctive relief, restitution for
consumers and civil penalties of $25,000 per violation. Hatch also is seeking a
supplemental civil penalty of $10,000 for each violation against a senior
citizen.
</P>
<P>
	   Irving said the company does not target any age group or demographic.
</P>
<P>
	   "The audience that we seek is the United States population," he said, adding
that the company sells everything from Rolling Stone magazine to Glenn Miller
tapes.
</P>
<P>
	   The states sued Monday because a hearing was scheduled Tuesday in a proposed
settlement of a class-action lawsuit against the company. The attorneys general
feared a settlement might keep them from suing in the future. Hatch and others
think the class action does little for people victimized by misleading
sweepstakes contests and doesn't do enough to prohibit similar practices in the
future.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the lawyers who filed that suit, Steven A. Katz, expected consumers
to collect between $14 million and $16 million in that case. The deadline for
filing a claim was Nov. 5. The "fairness hearing" to finalize the case is
scheduled for Tuesday in U.S. District Court in East St. Louis, Ill.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 43 million consumers eligible in the class-action lawsuit, about
100,000 people responded, Irving said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, President Clinton signed into law a measure designed to help
protect people from sweepstakes scams.
</P>
<P>
	   The Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act bars sponsors from
implying that buying products can increase entrants' chances of winning big
prizes, requires prominent display of messages that no purchase is required and
bars telling recipients that they have won a prize unless they actually have.
</P>
<P>
	   It also imposes million-dollar fines on sweepstakes companies that violate
the law.
</P>
<P>
	   The states that had sued Publishers Clearing House earlier were Arizona,
Connecticut, Florida, Michigan, Missouri, Texas, Wisconsin, Washington and
Indiana.
</P>
<P>
	   Publishers Clearing House was founded in 1953 and has been holding
sweepstakes since 1967. The company has given out about $137 million in major
prizes and awards, Irving said. In 1997 and 1998, the company had annual sales
of about $375 million.

<HEADLINE> SEC Head Warns Mutual Fund Buyers  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's the kind of TV ad that attracts attention: A
tow-truck driver trades stocks online with a big brokerage firm and makes enough
money to buy his own island.
</P>
<P>
	   One person who was watching was the nation's top securities regulator,
Arthur Levitt, who publicly criticized such ads last spring, saying they held
out unrealistic promises of quick riches.
</P>
<P>
	   Now Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is turning
his attention to mutual fund ads that boast triple-digit returns.
</P>
<P>
	   The ads "play to people's emotions rather than their intellect," Levitt said
Monday in an interview with The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   He decried a recent proliferation of advertising by mutual fund companies
promsing huge returns that may have been pumped up by stocks whose shares soared
after an initial public offering. Only the fine print in the ads explains why
the performance was so strong, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors should look at mutual fund fees and other factors besides past
performance when choosing funds, Levitt said.
</P>
<P>
	   Elizabeth Powell, a spokeswoman for the Investment Company Institute, a
group representing the mutual fund industry, said, "We take very seriously our
responsibility to help people have realistic expectations."
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Powell said the group has been looking into the matter of advertising.
</P>
<P>
	   John Brennan, ICI's president, who also is the chief executive of big fund
company Vanguard Group, has said advertising that touts triple-digit returns is
undesirable because it ultimately will disappoint investors.
</P>
<P>
	   A few highly profitable initial public offerings, especially of technology
stocks, can bring extremely impressive results for small mutual funds -- a
performance that might not be repeated when the funds grow larger.
</P>
<P>
	   "Numbers, like images, are very malleable things. Be skeptical, read the
small print and don't forget that the past is a poor predictor of the future,"
said Marc Beauchamp, spokesman for the North American Securities Administrators
Association, which represents state securities regulators.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first case of its kind, the SEC last September went after a mutual
fund company for allegedly misleading investors in ads and disclosure documents
by not explaining how one of its funds made big first-year gains.
</P>
<P>
	   The company, Van Kampen Investment Advisory Corp., agreed to pay $100,000 in
a settlement. It neither admitted to nor denied the SEC's allegations. Other
enforcement action could follow.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC also is considering tightening the requirements for material
included in mutual fund prospectuses and other disclosure documents, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   At a time when 177 mutual funds are posting annual gains of 100 percent or
more, investors should avoid getting fixated on performance and should look at a
fund's costs, Levitt said. A 1 percent higher annual fee will reduce a fund
investor's ending balance by 18 percent after 20 years, he noted.
</P>
<P>
	   The stakes are high. Some 83 million Americans now invest in mutual funds,
whose total assets are estimated at $6 trillion, up from around $1 trillion in
1990.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   EDITOR'S NOTE -- The SEC's mutual fund tips are available on the Investor
Assistance section of the agency's Web site at www.sec.gov. The site also
includes a mutual fund cost calculator, designed to help investors compare the
long-term impact of sales charges, fees and expenses.

<HEADLINE> Steel Group Reports Earnings Drop  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Blaming a decline in steel prices due to overseas
competition, USX-U.S. Steel Group reported a 55 percent decline in earnings in
the fourth quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Without adjusting for nonrecurring items, net income was $34 million, or 35
cents a share, compared to $76 million, or 81 cents a share, in the fourth
quarter in 1998, USX reported Monday. Adjusting for those items -- including a
higher-than-expected foreign tax assessment -- net income for the fourth quarter
was $39 million, or 42 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourth quarter sales rose 7.7 percent to $1.46 billion from $1.36 billion in
the same quarter a year ago, the company reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts had predicted 43 cents per share in the quarter, according to
Zack's Investment Research. Consensus analyst estimates from First Call was 41
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   "More or less, it was in line with expectations," said Richard Aldrich, an
analyst with Lehman Brothers. "It looks like, if you back out the nonrecurring
items, they would break even in the steel segment, which was a little bit worse
than expected."
</P>
<P>
	   USX Corp. board chairman Thomas J. Usher noted that operating rates improved
and shipments increased more than 20 percent in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Shipments for the fourth quarter were 2.86 million net tons, up 22 percent
from 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Raw steel capability utilization in the fourth quarter was 97 percent, up
significantly from 76 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, net income was $44 million, or 40 cents per share, down 88
percent from $364 million, or $3.92 per share, in 1998. But 1999 sales dropped
15.5 percent to $5.31 billion from $6.28 billion for all of 1998, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1999 figure does not take into account an after-tax charge of $39
million, or 44 cents per share, associated with USX's investment in USS/Kobe
Steel Co. and costs related to the formation of Republic Technologies LLC. USX
Corp. completed its purchase of Kobe Steel's 50 percent interest in Lorain
Tubular Co. in Ohio late last year.

<HEADLINE> Ruling Favors Curbs on Tobacco Ads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BOSTON (AP) -- A federal judge has rejected a claim that Massachusetts's ban
on outdoor tobacco advertising near schools violates the tobacco industry's free
speech rights.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge William G. Young on Monday upheld state regulations that
prohibit outdoor ads for cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and cigars within 1,000
feet of schools and playgrounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Young also upheld a state requirement that cigar packages bear health
warnings. But he struck down a restriction on tobacco ads inside retail stores.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a great victory in our effort to combat underage smoking in
Massachusetts," Attorney General Tom Reilly said in a written statement. "The
goal of these regulations is to reduce the influence of tobacco advertising on
children."
</P>
<P>
	   Tobacco companies had already agreed to pull billboard ads nationwide to
settle litigation brought by states over the costs of treating smoking-related
illnesses. But the Massachusetts regulations also included a ban on tobacco ads
facing the street from stores near schools.
</P>
<P>
	   John Sorrells, a spokesman for Philip Morris Inc., said the company's
attorneys would study the opinion and decide whether to appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believe in commercial free speech -- and that was the reason we
challenged these regulations," he said. "We agree with Attorney General Reilly
that kids shouldn't smoke nor should they have access to tobacco products. But
we also believe strongly that we should have the right to communicate with our
adult consumers."
</P>
<P>
	   Young ruled in December that federal tobacco laws didn't prohibit the state
from placing its own restrictions on tobacco advertising. But Young at that time
did not address the industry's claim that such state bans violated the
industry's right to free speech.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Report Ponders Amtrak's Independence  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ARNOLD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amtrak supporters are fretting out loud that an oversight
committee may be setting too high a bar for the national railway if it is to
avoid potential liquidation and restructuring of operations.
</P>
<P>
	   The Amtrak Reform Council, in its first annual report, challenged Amtrak's
claim that it is on target to become self-sufficient by the end of fiscal year
2002, as required by Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the council's interpretation, Amtrak must save or earn an additional
$567 million by that deadline to avoid possible wholesale changes in its
operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Ross Capon, executive director of the National Association of Railroad
Passengers, said that financial gap could be nearly impossible to close.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you're going to raise the bar another $567 million, it seems to me it's
a no-brainer that they can't do it,'' he said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said the report ``mischaracterized
the intent of this administration'' on how to measure Amtrak's progress.
</P>
<P>
	   Using the standard it believes should apply -- which excludes the cost of
equipment depreciation and some equipment overhauls -- Amtrak says it is on pace
to be free of government operating subsidies by the end of fiscal year 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   But the council report said that, factoring in the disputed costs, Amtrak
will miss that mark by $567 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The report also found that Amtrak's ridership ``has remained virtually
unchanged'' during a decade of transportation growth in America and that Amtrak
continues to incur ``significant financial losses.'' It questioned whether
Amtrak productivity is improving.
</P>
<P>
	   Council Chairman Gil Carmichael said the report was written to raise
questions rather than offer conclusions and was not meant to be a condemnation
of Amtrak.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The council wants Amtrak to succeed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Amtrak officials said the report failed to recognize the railroad's
recent progress over the last few years in increasing riders and revenues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For the past two years we've been ahead of our business plan targets,''
Amtrak spokesman John Wolf said. ``Through the first quarter of this year, we're
ahead of our business targets again. You can't argue with that success.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sonny Hall, president of the AFL-CIO transportation trades department, said
the report should have been titled ``a preliminary death wish for Amtrak.''
</P>
<P>
	   The report was approved 8-3 by the council, with two dissenters writing
separate opinions.
</P>
<P>
	   Clarence Monin, the labor union representative, wrote that the council ``has
carved out an ideological agenda for itself which ... extends far beyond what
Congress intended.''
</P>
<P>
	   Jolene Molitoris, administrator of the Federal Rail Administration who
represents Slater on the council, wrote that the report ``works counter to our
shared goal'' of helping Amtrak.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, who chairs the Senate Commerce
subcommittee on surface transportation, said she hopes to hold hearings in March
on what standard should be apply to measure self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
	   Hutchison said it would be ``very myopic to cut Amtrak off and lose (it) ...
forever until we have given them every chance to succeed.''

<HEADLINE> Sundance Touts Female Directors  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- Heather Graham gets to karate-kick her male co-star
across a room. Director Mary Harron pulls the strings on a male psychopath
running loose with a chain saw. Golden Globe winner Janet McTeer fights an
academic glass ceiling in the early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
	   Better days are here for female filmmakers, at least on the independent
movie circuit. The lineup of 113 feature films at the Sundance Film Festival
through next weekend includes a record 29 pictures directed by women.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm thrilled at what's happening on a personal basis as a woman and as a
fan of these films," said Liz Manne, who co-founded film distributor Fine Line
Features and now is executive vice president of programming and marketing for
the Sundance channel. "The originality we're seeing from these women is
remarkable."
</P>
<P>
	   "Anyone who thinks these are a bunch of chick flicks is really making a
mistake," said festival co-director Geoffrey Gilmore.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the field:
</P>
<P>
	   --"American Psycho," Harron's brutish, bloody adaptation of Bret Easton
Ellis' novel about a 1980s Wall Streeter whose hobby is serial murder by ax,
pistol, chain saw or nail gun.
</P>
<P>
	   --Sofia Coppola's "The Virgin Suicides," a dark comic tale of a group of
spirited sisters in a repressive family. The director is the daughter of
filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola.
</P>
<P>
	   --Gurinder Chadha's "What's Cooking?", a skillfully layered love song to Los
Angeles told through the turmoil of four ethnically diverse families as they
prepare for Thanksgiving. The movie was the premiere feature for the festival's
opening night last week.
</P>
<P>
	   --Maggie Greenwald's "Songcatcher," starring McTeer, who won a Golden Globe
Sunday for "Tumbleweeds," as a musicologist in 1907 who embarks on independent
research in Appalachia after she's denied a promotion in male-centered academia.
</P>
<P>
	   --Karyn Kusama's "Girlfight," about a high school senior who bucks her
father and begins rigorous training as an amateur boxer.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you could open a dictionary to the word 'director' 40 years ago and it
had a picture, you would probably see some white guy with a beret and boots,"
said Lisa Krueger, director of "Committed," which stars Graham as a jilted wife
on a bold quest to stitch her life back together.
</P>
<P>
	   "Now the picture looks like 500 different people, men and women."
</P>
<P>
	   Krueger was honored at the festival over the weekend by Women in Film, which
called her a pioneer for "Committed" and her previous Sundance feature, "Manny
and Lo."
</P>
<P>
	   Even with film schools turning out more female graduates and more women
moving into studio management, female directors say they generally have a harder
time than their male counterparts finding money to make their movies.
</P>
<P>
	   Valerie Breiman said it took almost six years to finish her Sundance entry,
"Love and Sex," a screwball comedy starring Famke Janssen.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's great just to see the excitement among all these women who made movies
and got them here," Breiman said. "We're all just kind of jumping up and down. I
hope it's not just a fad. I hope women will be able to continue to make more and
more movies."
</P>
<P>
	   Financial success ultimately dictates whether a director will be able to
continue to make movies and graduate from low-budget independent films to
costlier productions. With exceptions such as Penny Marshall or Mimi Leder,
Hollywood rarely considers female directors for big-budget pictures.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's very important and interesting to tell stories about women, but
Hollywood unfortunately doesn't view a lot of those as profitable," said Zeinabu
irene Davis, who directed "Compensation."
</P>
<P>
	   The movie, which explores segregation and deaf culture through parallel
stories in two time frames, took Davis seven years to finish. She said she hopes
the Sundance exposure will help to land future directing jobs for her and other
female filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   "I certainly hope so," Davis said. "Otherwise, what am I doing here?"

<HEADLINE> Cuba-U.S. Trade Relations Warming  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- While the world focused on the fate of a 6-year-old Cuban
boy, a slow warming in U.S.-Cuban trade relations was quietly underway today as
exhibitors set up the first American trade show in communist Cuba in nearly four
decades.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Healthcare Exhibition, opening this morning, is the latest in a
series of small steps made in U.S.-Cuban relations since January 1999, when
President Clinton announced plans to increase contact between Americans and
Cubans.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 100 American companies were participating in the exhibition, all
of which have an ``interest in the future,'' said Peter W. Nathan, president of
exhibit organizer PWN Exhibicion LLC, a company based in Westport, Conn.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a market there. They want to be here when relations are
normalized,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Since Clinton announced measures to increase ``people-to-people'' contact,
Cuba has seen a significant increase in visits by American lawmakers, business
people, students and athletes.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the international custody battle over Elian Gonzalez -- the boy
rescued off the coast of Florida in November -- Cuba-U.S. relations have
actually improved over the past year. The debate over whether Elian should be
with his father on the island or with his relatives in Miami is more a dispute
between Cubans on the island and in the United States than a clash between two
governments.
</P>
<P>
	   In the last week, Oregon high school students held a debate with Cuban
students, the baseball team from the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul,
Minn., traveled here for a game with a Cuban team, and more than 600 college
students from the University of Pittsburgh's Semester at Sea arrived on a cruise
ship.
</P>
<P>
	   Other notable visitors over the past year included the Baltimore Orioles,
who played the Cuban national team, and Illinois Gov. George Ryan, who met with
President Fidel Castro and spoke out against the U.S. trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These may be small steps, but I think that they help normalize
relations,'' said Nathan, who has organized similar trade shows in the former
Soviet Union and communist China.
</P>
<P>
	   The trade embargo against Cuba, in effect since the early 1960s, remains
unchanged. But the American government has increasingly granted companies
licenses to sell medicine and healthcare products to Cuba, business experts say.
</P>
<P>
	   There also have been increased moves by some members of Congress to lift
restrictions in U.S. sales of both medicine and food to Cuba. So far, those
efforts have failed to receive full congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials say that since 1992, between 40 and 50 licenses have been
granted to American companies to sell medicines and medical supplies in Cuba,
and that only a handful of requests have been turned down.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. government says $19 million worth of American medical sales to Cuba
were licensed in 1998, and another $26 million were licensed in the first half
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Actual sales, however, were much lower. While Cuban officials complain the
Americans have rules that scare away sellers, U.S. officials say they believe
financially pressed Cuba won't be able to come up with the money to complete the
sales.
</P>
<P>
	   During this week's exhibition, which ends Saturday, products ranging from
pharmaceuticals to hospital beds to X-ray machines will be shown. The U.S.
license granted for the event will allow the exhibitors to sell products to the
Cuban government during or after the show.
</P>
<P>
	   Afterward, 90 percent of the products will be donated to the Cuban
government, Nathan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Agribusiness giant Archer Daniels Midland Co. is lead sponsor and will
exhibit vitamins and food supplements. Eastman Kodak will show imaging devices,
and Eli Lilly will exhibit pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
	   The last such U.S. trade show on the island was held in 1960 for American
travel agents.

<HEADLINE> FDA Issues Heartburn Drug Warning  </HEADLINE>
    By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is renewing attempts to protect heartburn
sufferers from deadly irregular heartbeats caused by the popular medication
Propulsid, ordering that patients not take the drug unless they first undergo
EKGs that ensure their hearts are healthy.
</P>
<P>
	   Patients now taking Propulsid for nighttime heartburn should ask their
doctors about switching medication, and no one with heart disease or a list of
other illnesses should ever use the drug, the Food and Drug Administration
warned Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA's unusually strong warning comes in the wake of 70 deaths and 200
other reports of heart rhythm problems, including the life-threatening irregular
heartbeat ventricular fibrillation, since Propulsid hit the market in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   Manufacturer Johnson &AMP; Johnson mailed the warning to thousands of physicians
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Propulsid had sales of about $970 million last year, according to analysts.
Johnson &AMP; Johnson shares closed Monday at $83.68 3/4, down 6.18 3/4, or 6.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA first warned that Propulsid can cause serious heart problems in June
1998, but reports of deaths and hospitalizations still mounted.
</P>
<P>
	   So Monday, the agency took additional steps to make sure Propulsid is used
only as a last resort, by patients whose severe nighttime heartburn is not
relieved by other drugs -- and who appear at low risk for the cardiac side
effects.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA said it was not pulling Propulsid off the market because the drug
can help some patients and because the new warnings should make using it safer.
</P>
<P>
	   The cardiac risk is relatively small considering an estimated 30 million
Propulsid prescriptions have been written since 1993, and most side-effect
sufferers had clear risk factors, said Dr. Florence Houn, FDA's chief of
gastrointestinal drugs. That means careful doctors who heed the new warnings
should be able to keep Propulsid away from the patients whose hearts are most
likely to be damaged, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want warnings to go out. We want education to the prescribers to be
reinforced," she said. "This drug requires careful prescription."
</P>
<P>
	   But an expert on drug-induced irregular heartbeats said it will be difficult
for the doctors who most prescribe Propulsid -- gastrointestinal specialists --
to comply.
</P>
<P>
	   "FDA warnings have not been as successful as we would like in being
translated into care," said Dr. Raymond Woosley, a pharmacologist at Georgetown
University Medical Center. "This one will be especially difficult because of the
fact that many physicians don't have an EKG" machine in their offices.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, some computerized EKG equipment doesn't accurately read a critical
type of heartbeat measurement called "QT prolongation," requiring doctors
skilled in reading EKGs to determine that manually, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Among FDA's warnings:
</P>
<P>
	   --Do not prescribe Propulsid to anyone with heart disease, including
valvular disease, or who has ever had an irregular heartbeat, abnormal EKG or QT
prolongation.
</P>
<P>
	   --Do not prescribe Propulsid to people with kidney disease; lung disease;
low blood levels of the electrolytes potassium, calcium or magnesium; an eating
disorder; dehydration or prolonged vomiting.
</P>
<P>
	   --Never take Propulsid while using some other medications, including
antibiotics like erythromycin; antifungals like ketoconazole; AIDS-fighting
protease inhibitors; drugs for irregular heartbeat; certain antidepressants and
antipsychotics such as Elavil or Serzone. Also do not take with grapefruit
juice.
</P>
<P>
	   --In addition to an EKG, patients being considered for Propulsid should
undergo blood tests to check electrolyte levels.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA will gather heartburn and cardiac experts for a special meeting
April 12 to determine whether the new Propulsid warnings are adequate.

<HEADLINE> Media Consultant Bob Squier Dies  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bob Squier, a Democratic media consultant whose work for
presidential candidates from Hubert Humphrey to Bill Clinton helped transform
the way political campaigns are waged, has died at age 65.
</P>
<P>
	   He had been battling colon cancer when he died Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton remembered Squier's ``path-breaking political commentary''
as an analyst on NBC's ``Today'' show and his work for progressive candidates.
``I owe him much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Throughout the course of his career, Bob was a pioneer in the art of
political communications,'' said Clinton. ``Bob helped make policy and politics
understandable and exciting for millions of Americans.''
</P>
<P>
	   An award-winning documentary filmmaker, Squier's first presidential campaign
work was for Hubert Humphrey in 1968. He made spots for Ed Muskie in 1972 and
Jimmy Carter in 1976. He was an architect of the Clinton-Gore re-election media
strategy in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Along the way, Squier had a hand in transforming advertising's role in
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   A professional partner, Bill Knapp, said Squier was ``a groundbreaking
political consultant'' and credited him with helping to create the modern
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In this business, you're kind of really judged by the number of wins you
have by your name, and no one had more than him,'' said fellow consultant James
Carville. ``He was to political consulting what Hank Aaron was to home runs.''
</P>
<P>
	   Squier had a reputation for hard-hitting spots, and was at times accused of
crossing the ethical line.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1990, one Squier spot charged a gubernatorial candidate in Massachusetts
was ``plagued by questions about his corruption record'' -- the questions were
about the candidate's record in prosecuting official wrongdoing. Another Squier
spot accused a Michigan candidate of voting ``to let dangerous criminals out of
state prisons early'' when Squier's client had put the same early release
program into effect.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet Squier was an advocate of greater media scrutiny of the claims made by
political advertisers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You've just got to be much tougher with people like us as we make our
spots and advance our claims,'' he told reporters at a 1988 forum.
</P>
<P>
	   Squier created ads for dozens of campaigns for the Senate, the House and
governorships. He was part of Clinton's creative team in 1992, and was a close
friend of Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's office released a statement from the presidential candidate that
called Squier ``one of the most talented and dedicated advisers the Democratic
Party has ever had.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Squier's role in the Gore presidential campaign was curtailed
when Carter Eskew, an estranged Squier protege, was brought on board to help
with his media strategy.
</P>
<P>
	   Eskew and Squier had a bitter falling out over problems related to their
shared consultancy a half-dozen years earlier, and the bad blood generated
headlines when they were brought back together.
</P>
<P>
	   Squier sought to put an end to the intrigue. ``The bottom line on this is we
are already working together with the common goal of getting Al Gore elected
president,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to his political work, Squier won awards for his documentaries,
including films on William Faulkner and Herman Melville. He was working on a
piece about Ernest Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
	   Squier leaves his wife, Prudence, and two sons.

<HEADLINE> Court To Rule on Campaign Spending  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Supreme Court decision reaffirming state authority to
limit individual campaign contributions has given new vigor to congressional
efforts to pass broad changes in campaign spending rules.
</P>
<P>
	   But proponents of banning large, unrestricted donations known as ``soft
money'' and other measures to rein in campaign spending still face an uphill
fight: The legislation is particularly touchy in an election year and is
strongly opposed by Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision Monday, reinstated Missouri's $1,075
cap on individual contributions to candidates for state office. It was the first
time the high court had ruled on contribution limits since 1976.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Marty Meehan, D-Mass., who has joined with Republican Rep. Chris Shays
of Connecticut in authoring House campaign finance reform, called the decision a
``major victory.'' He said the decision ``puts to rest the myth that campaign
contributions limits are unconstitutional.''
</P>
<P>
	   The court has agreed, Shays said, that ``unlimited campaign contributions
distort the political process.''
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998 and again last year, Shays and Meehan succeeded in winning House
passage of legislation to ban ``soft money,'' the large sum donations made to
political parties by corporations and unions, and put curbs on ``issue ads''
which sometimes sharply criticize a candidate without directly advocating his
defeat.
</P>
<P>
	   But similar legislation proposed by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Russ
Feingold, D-Wis., has never been able to gain the 60 votes needed to cut off
debate in the Senate, even last year when McCain narrowed the bill to cover only
``soft money.''
</P>
<P>
	   Feingold, in an interview, said supporters are only five votes away from the
60-vote plateau and the court decision ``can change the dynamics'' by bringing
on board those senators who have opposed the bill on constitutional grounds.
``It doesn't take much to change the momentum.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republican leaders and other opponents have argued that limiting
contributions to campaigns violates constitutional rights to free speech.
Republicans, including top presidential contender George W. Bush, also assert
that the bills would hurt their party, which traditionally raises more than the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   Campaign finance is one issue that has sharply divided Bush and McCain, his
chief rival for the GOP presidential nomination, in candidate debates.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who heads the GOP Senate election committee and
is the body's leading foe of campaign finance bills, asserted that the Supreme
Court ruling was a ``narrow decision'' that ``had absolutely nothing to do with
soft money or contributions to political parties.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the court made clear that limits on contributions will be struck
down when they impede effective communication of a candidate's message.
</P>
<P>
	   The court ruled that fighting corruption, or even the perception of
corruption, justifies contribution limits. The three dissenters -- Justices
Anthony M. Kennedy, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas -- argued that the
decision trampled free-speech rights.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton, who has been a strong backer of the Shays-Meehan and
McCain-Feingold bills, hailed the court decision as a ``victory for democracy,''
saying in a statement that ``the American people know that our political system
needs to be fixed, and today's decision sets that stage for further reform.''

<HEADLINE> East Hartford officials want road improvements in return for  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   EAST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Saying they fear the proposed UConn football
stadium would cause massive game-day traffic jams, East Hartford officials are
requesting that the state pay for road improvements that could exceed $50
million.
<P>
	   Mayor Timothy D. Larson and members of the East Hartford Town Council
envision ramps from I-84 and Route 2 sending vehicles directly into the stadium
site, as well as an access road connecting one entrance to the other.
</P>
<P>
	   But the state is taking a different view.
</P>
<P>
	   The Department of Transportation has issued an opinion that existing
highways and roads could handle the traffic generated by the 35,000-seat
stadium, and a formal traffic study should be completed within two weeks, said
Benson Cohn, executive finance officer with the state's Office of Policy and
Management.
</P>
<P>
	   Legislative leaders say they are wary of anything that could increase the
cost of the University of Connecticut stadium, which is estimated at about $90
million. Even some members of the East Hartford delegation are doubting whether
they can convince their colleagues of the need for improved roads.
</P>
<P>
	   "What we want and what is possible are two different things," said Sen. Gary
D. LeBeau, D-East Hartford. Referring to the road improvements, LeBeau said, "It
would just make the whole project impractical. It will put the stadium too far
out of reach."
</P>
<P>
	   But without the improvements, some East Hartford officials said they would
consider revoking their support for the stadium. They said the improvements,
first proposed when the owners of Six Flags amusement parks briefly considered
buying the land, are necessary to avoid game-day gridlock and backups on the
highways and in residential neighborhoods surrounding the nearby Pratt &AMP; Whitney
Aircraft factory. They also want to ensure further development of Rentschler
Field.
</P>
<P>
	   Relying on the existing roads "to simply carry the load is very
short-sighted," Larson said. "That is not an option."
</P>
<P>
	   Town Council Chairman Richard F. Kehoe said: "If they refuse to do the
improvements, then we certainly cannot guarantee that the stadium would be built
in timely fashion. This is not a stadium that we asked for. That is something we
will continue to stress."
</P>
<P>
	   Dean Pagani, the governor's press secretary, said the initial findings of
the transportation department show that the stadium would not require anywhere
near the same level of road improvements that were planned for the Six Flags
amusement park.
</P>
<P>
	   Pressure is on the state to move the UConn football program into a stadium
with at least 30,000 seats by 2003, a requirement for jumping to Division I-A in
the Big East from Division I-AA in the Atlantic 10 Conference.

<HEADLINE> Efforts to reduce traffic are slow going  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) - The plan to reduce rush-hour traffic on the
highways of Fairfield County is falling short of its goals, according to the
group overseeing the plan.
<P>
	   The Southwest Corridor Action Council was expected to release a report today
that concludes the state will not be able to reach its goal of reducing
rush-hour traffic by 5 percent from 1997 numbers unless more is done, The
Advocate of Stamford reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The 19-member group received a status report from state Department of
Transportation officials Monday. The DOT reported it has met 17.5 percent of the
goal by removing about 1,500 cars from Interstate 95, the Merritt Parkway and
Route 1 over the first two years of the plan, well behind its own estimates of
31 percent over that time.
</P>
<P>
	   Both the DOT and the action council must report to the General Assembly
about the traffic reduction plan by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
	   "Things are moving slowly it's fair to say," Christopher Bruhl, chairman of
the action council, said after the group's meeting Monday. "But it's also fair
to say you can't just take the first year or two years and automatically project
it over the five years."
</P>
<P>
	   In its report, DOT said a daily average of 1,504 vehicles have been removed
from the roadways between Greenwich and Branford. The department has said it
will need to remove 8,600 vehicles to meet the 5 percent goal by 2003. It had
projected a total of 1,700 vehicles over the first two years of the plan.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are making modest progress toward the five-year goal," said Harry
Harris, chief of the DOT's public transportation bureau. "But you can see we're
lagging behind somewhat."
</P>
<P>
	   Transportation officials have said that a 5 percent reduction in rush-hour
traffic will ease gridlock conditions, enabling vehicles to move at a steady
pace of about 45 mph.

<HEADLINE> Stocks in Asia Telecom Companies Up  </HEADLINE>
   By DIRK BEVERIDGE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HONG KONG (AP) -- Shares in the big Hong Kong and Singapore phone companies
soared today on news they may merge, and analysts said the move could be a valid
way to fight back against growing competition in their home markets.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies said late Mondaythey were contemplating a ``merger of equals''
to create a phone giant worth almost $60 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Executives declined to comment on details, but investors were optimistic
nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
	   Stock for Singapore Telecommunications Ltd. was up by 4.6 percent today on
news of the negotiations, while Hong Kong's Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT climbed 2.6
percent in early trading today.
</P>
<P>
	   The merger talks were made public three days after Singapore's government
announced it would open its local telephone market to full competition in April
-- two years ahead of schedule. The news sent SingTel's shares into a tailspin.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I wouldn't categorize this as desperation, but they are under pressure to
diversify,'' said Ali Naqvi, head of Singapore research at investment bank
Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the move seemed sensible because it came at a time when both
Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT and SingTel must confront increasingly competitive
pressures as their markets open to new players who probably will try to win
customers by slashing prices.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's good. They will be getting bigger and hopefully trimming costs a bit
by firing some redundant staff,'' said Stephen Leung, a telecommunications
analyst in Hong Kong for Daiwa Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   The two companies are strong, medium-sized players, both operating in highly
developed telecommunications markets that cater to the large financial
industries in Singapore and Hong Kong -- typically considered rivals on the
Asian business battlefield.
</P>
<P>
	   Although some analysts questioned whether bigger was necessarily better,
others said the similarities between SingTel and Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT could
provide any merged entity with useful synergies in dealing with corporate
clients throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
	   David Leow, associate research director at HSBC James Capel in Singapore,
said SingTel was wise to be ``going regional.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hong Kong's government last week took the latest step in opening its phone
market -- which already is more liberalized than the one in Singapore -- by
granting telecommunications licenses to 17 companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Five plan to operate wireless networks serving residential and business
customers, while the other 12 will operate international services via satellite
-- ending Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT's monopoly in that market.
</P>
<P>
	   Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT, which is 54 percent held by Cable &AMP; Wireless PLC of
Britain, had previously lost its local services monopoly.
</P>
<P>
	   Telecommunications buyouts have dramatically reshaped the phone industry in
the United States, and the merger mania recently spread to Europe. Such activity
has been more muted in Asia, but Leung said that could change if the Hong
Kong-Singapore deal is approved and other sizable companies see a need to seek
out partners.

<HEADLINE> Bush, Gore Shift to Difficult Stage  </HEADLINE>
   By WALTER R. MEARS AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- In the first act, Al Gore and George W. Bush, the
leading men of the 2000 presidential campaign, lived up to their billings. Now
the front-runners shift to a more difficult stage, New Hampshire, where their
challengers loom stronger than in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush gained 41 percent of the vote in a field of six in the Iowa Republican
caucuses Monday night, a GOP record, but second-place Steve Forbes cast himself
in the part he sought.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes got 30 percent of the GOP vote, emerging as the prime conservative
candidate against Texas Gov. Bush and Sen. John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
	   As expected, Forbes said he had beaten the expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Gore trounced Bill Bradley, 63 percent to 35 percent, which
certainly won't go unnoticed in New Hampshire's first of the presidential
primaries next week, although Gore said the contest there is ``not derivative
... it stands on its own.''
</P>
<P>
	   That's the only politically-correct thing for a candidate to say; New
Hampshire voters could feel slighted by any suggestion that Iowa will influence
them. ``New Hampshire will go its own way,'' said Kathy Sullivan, who chairs the
state Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
	   For the record, the Iowa caucuses have not echoed into New Hampshire.
Democrat Jimmy Carter won both on his way to the White House in 1976, but since
then, only incumbent presidents have done so, usually uncontested.
</P>
<P>
	   In New Hampshire, polls show Gore regaining the Democratic edge he had lost
to Bradley although his margins are narrow in most surveys.
</P>
<P>
	   Among Republicans, most polls rate the contest about even between Bush and
McCain. ``I'm predicting a very close outcome,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   With no days to spare in the campaign for the Feb. 1 primary, the Iowa
contestants were flying east within hours of the caucus verdict. The Bush and
Gore victories in Iowa were expected, forecast by the polls, and anticipated by
rival candidates, who had effectively conceded first place in advance.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley campaigned hard, and expensively, to close in on Gore, but tried to
take the edge off beforehand by saying 31 percent would be a good showing for an
insurgent candidate, since that was the share Sen. Edward M. Kennedy got against
President Carter in 1980. Kennedy, who is campaigning for Gore now, scoffed at
the idea.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said in defeat that it wasn't the end, it was the beginning. He said
he'll keep contesting Gore whatever happens in New Hampshire, into what he calls
the national primary campaign five weeks after that, when California and New
York are among 15 states holding primaries or caucuses on March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said he'd won ``a tremendous victory,'' that he was thrilled to have
gained more than 40 percent of the vote in a multi-candidate field.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the Bush camp had hoped to open a wider gap over Forbes, one that
might have undermined the GOP rival with the personal fortune to spend, and a
political past of using it on attack advertising in the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, Forbes ran strong enough to describe himself as the conservative
GOP alternative to Bush and McCain, candidates he called the moderates. With his
30 percent share, Forbes got more votes than his rivals on the right -- Alan
Keyes, who ran third with 14 percent and Gary Bauer, fourth at 9 percent, a blow
to his campaign future.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the 11 percent of Republican caucus voters who listed abortion as
their top issue, two-thirds voted for one of those three candidates. Bush had
been defending his position on the issue in the closing days of the campaign,
insisting that he has an anti-abortion record to match his rhetoric, although he
will not take the pledge Forbes demands, against nominating anyone who is not
against abortion to be a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
	   That sliced into his victory margin, showing the power of the conservative
Christians who helped relegate his father to an embarrassing third in the Iowa
caucuses in 1988, the year he was elected president.
</P>
<P>
	   In another survey, Gov. Bush got a near shutout among the 12 percent of Iowa
Republicans who said the candidate quality that concerned them most was the
ability to win the White House if nominated. Ninety-nine percent chose Bush.
That can-win standing is what made him the front-runner in the first place, and
keeps him far ahead in national polls.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's campaign strategist said Forbes wouldn't be able to match his Iowa
showing in the coming contests. ``This is his high water mark,'' said Karl Rove.
``New Hampshire might be the same for John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain didn't compete in Iowa, saving his money to concentrate on New
Hampshire and later contests, especially the South Carolina primary on Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the caucus outcome wouldn't affect his campaign. ``People in New
Hampshire don't pay a great deal of attention to what happens in Iowa,'' McCain
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In my view, the game is here,'' he told a New Hampshire campaign crowd
Monday night. He had played a bit part in Iowa, debating there twice. He got 5
percent, fifth out of six.
</P>
<P>
	   The only candidate behind him: Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, at 1 percent, and
all but done with his quixotic campaign. Hatch said that if he ran last, he
would consider quitting.

<HEADLINE> Voters Say Bush Best Choice  </HEADLINE>
   By KEN THOMAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Iowa Republicans rewarded George W. Bush for his
ability to restore the nation's moral values and said he was a strong leader who
can win the White House in November, a poll of participants found.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Vice President Al Gore's defeat of former Sen. Bill Bradley was
aided by key Democratic constituents such as older voters, union members and
voters with lower incomes.
</P>
<P>
	   In the race for second-place Monday night among the six-man Republican
field, publisher Steve Forbes won the backing of those who thought taxes was the
top issue. He had more than a 3-to-1 edge among those who picked abortion -- but
only 1 in 10 called it their top issue.
</P>
<P>
	   REPUBLICANS
</P>
<P>
	   Voters who comprised the party's social conservatives split their support
among Bush, Forbes and commentator Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush earned 37 percent of the one-third of voters who listed moral values as
their main issue, with Keyes drawing nearly three out of 10 voters.
</P>
<P>
	   During the campaign, Forbes presented himself as the main choice of social
conservatives. Bush, however, gained the most support from those who described
themselves as very conservative and somewhat conservative. Keyes received about
a fifth of the very conservative group.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes led among the 25 percent of caucus-goers who thought taxes were the
top issue, getting half while Bush gained the support of four of 10.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Steve Forbes will be an absolute pit bull when it comes to downsizing
government,'' said Sharlene Dunlap, 33, of Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes fared better than Bush among voters who said the most important
candidate qualities were standing up for beliefs, caring about the average
American and best representing conservative values.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush got the support of nearly all the roughly 12 percent of voters who said
the most important quality was being able to win in November.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bush is absolutely the most likely to be elected and to beat Al Gore,''
said Mary Lou Tappe at a caucus meeting in Albion, a small town in central Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   DEMOCRATS
</P>
<P>
	   Gore showed strength with a more than a 4-to-1 lead among the fifth of
Democratic voters who thought strong and decisive leadership was the top
quality. He also won more than 90 percent among another fifth of voters who
thought having the right experience was most important.
</P>
<P>
	   Health care became one of the focal issues in the Democratic race, with
Bradley offering a comprehensive plan that aims to provide universal coverage
for children and Gore offering a more limited option.
</P>
<P>
	   Voters appeared to lend their support to Gore on health care -- among the 16
percent who identified health care as their primary concern, Gore received 60
percent of the vote. The vice president also was favored by 75 percent of those
polled who listed Social Security and Medicare as top priorities.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president won the support of a broad range of voters, with a 3-to-1
edge among voters 60 and older, and almost a 4-to-1 edge among those who
approved of President Clinton's job performance.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore placed well among voters who earned between $30,000 and $50,000,
topping Bradley by a margin of nearly 3-to-1.
</P>
<P>
	   Among voters who identified themselves as liberal, Gore took about 60
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley drew support from a small slice of voters who called for new ideas
in the campaign and fared best among voters who earned more than $75,000. He and
Gore split support among the nearly 15 percent who called themselves
independents, and among the nearly half who had an unfavorable view of Clinton
as a person.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley led by more than 2-to-1 among those who disapproved of Clinton's job
performance, but fewer than a sixth of Democratic caucus participants held that
view.
</P>
<P>
	   The entrance polls were conducted by Voter News Service, a consortium of The
Associated Press, ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox and NBC. VNS surveyed 1,700 voters in the
GOP caucuses and 1,078 voters in the Democratic caucuses as they headed into
precincts Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points for the
overall Democratic sample and plus or minus 3 percentage points for Republicans,
larger for subgroups of each.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Head Back to N.H.  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the Iowa caucuses over, the presidential candidates
head back to New Hampshire with fresh, new TV ads aimed at an electorate that
appears closely divided among the leading contenders.
</P>
<P>
	   But they weren't missing in action.
</P>
<P>
	   While most candidates were off courting Iowans in advance of Monday night's
caucuses, their images lingered behind in ads on New Hampshire television.
</P>
<P>
	   But with just a week until that state's Feb. 1 primary, campaigns are
rolling out fresh spots aimed at delivering a final pitch or a powerful
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain and Democrat Bill Bradley
all have new ads ready to go. Vice President Al Gore is likely to release a new
one later this week. As the last of the undecided voters make up their minds,
the idea is to hit the one or two themes that matter most.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spent part of his last day in Iowa taping a new spot that aides called
a ``closer,'' hitting issues of taxes and education.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It focuses on those heart and soul issues that he seeks to do if he's
re-elected,'' said a Bush aide, speaking on condition of anonymity. The campaign
planned to release the ad today.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, Bush's chief rival for the GOP nomination, was pushing one of his
strongest credentials: military experience.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's only one man running for president who knows the military and
understands the world,'' says the new McCain ad, which began airing Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The spot, dubbed ``Commander,'' notes McCain's experience as a Navy pilot,
prisoner of war and U.S. senator. ``If America is to lead, then America's leader
must be prepared for that challenge,'' the narrator intones.
</P>
<P>
	   Media adviser Greg Stevens says the ad is meant to build on earlier
biographical spots that emphasized McCain's personal story, tying it together
with the duties of commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is one of our strongest messages of the campaign and we're using it
near the end here because it's something that distinguishes John McCain from the
rest of the field,'' Stevens said. ``It's time to remind voters in New Hampshire
what they like about John McCain -- that he's the adult in the crowd.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush aides said McCain was running away from the ongoing debate between the
two over how large a tax cut to promise voters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It appears Senator McCain is now trying to change the subject from the tax
debate,'' said Bush spokesman Scott McClellan.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, McCain continues to air an earlier ad on taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Democratic side, Bradley's new ad features Niki Tsongas, the widow of
Paul Tsongas, winner of the New Hampshire Democratic primary in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Tsongas compares Bradley to her late husband, saying Bradley supports
working people and trumpets ``big ideas,'' just as Tsongas did. And she swipes
at Gore without naming him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What disappoints me now is, just as with Paul, Bill's record is being
distorted,'' she says in the ad. ``But we don't have to listen to the
distortions.''
</P>
<P>
	   Like Bradley, Tsongas campaigned as a down-to-earth truth-teller.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She's a powerful figure,'' said Bradley spokeswoman Kristen Ludecke. ``Her
husband is well remembered in New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
	   Like other campaigns, Bradley's was ramping up ad spending in the New
Hampshire home stretch, shelling out nearly $350,000 on TV ads alone.

Bush, Gore Shift to Difficult Stage
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- In the first act, Al Gore and George W. Bush, the
leading men of the 2000 presidential campaign, lived up to their billings. Now
the front-runners shift to a more difficult stage, New Hampshire, where their
challengers loom stronger than in Iowa. Bush gained 41 percent of the vote in a
field of six in the Iowa Republican caucuses Monday night, a GOP record, but
second-place Steve Forbes cast himself in the part he sought. Forbes got 30
percent of the GOP vote, emerging as the prime conservative candidate against
Texas Gov. Bush and Sen. John McCain of Arizona.

<HEADLINE> No Assistant Coaches at Super Bowl  </HEADLINE>
    By BARRY WILNER AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Here's a new strategy for preparing to play the Super Bowl:
Leave the assistant coaches at home.
</P>
<P>
	   The St. Louis Rams did it. So did the Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
	   All of the assistants were breaking down film Monday and planed to put
together game plans today before heading to Atlanta on evening flights.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's a great idea," said Rams receiver Ricky Proehl, who caught the
winning touchdown pass in the NFC championship game Sunday. "They don't have to
come here and set up in a hurry and they can just do their job."
</P>
<P>
	   That job has been complicated by the lack of a one-week break between the
title games and the Super Bowl. While both teams and the head coaches were
required to be here on Monday, the NFL gave the Rams and Titans permission to
leave the assistants behind.
</P>
<P>
	   Further complicating matters for Tennessee were logistics. The Titans won
the AFC crown at Jacksonville on Sunday, then flew home. They attended a
celebration at Adelphia Coliseum that drew more than 30,000 fans, then had a
light workout Monday before traveling to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   "We left the staff back in Nashville to game-plan," Titans coach Jeff Fisher
said. "We don't have much time to think about this one. We want to get into a
normal routine as fast as we can."
</P>
<P>
	   Fisher met with his assistants before the team left Nashville.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're acquiring information now and putting it together," he said. "They
begin game-planning (today) with the first phase. They'll call me with it and if
I didn't like it, I told them I'd have one myself."
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams weren't quite so put out, because they won their title at home.
They also ran lightly and lifted weights Monday before heading to the site of
Sunday's big game.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're here to start a work week totally different than we have at any time
this year," Coach of the Year Dick Vermeil said. "Most of you probably recognize
that football coaches are terrible creatures of habit and feel very insecure
outside their normal routine.
</P>
<P>
	   "So right now I feel a little bit insecure, because I'm not working in our
normal routine. But hopefully, it won't show on Sunday. Other people are being
forced to do the same thing."
</P>
<P>
	   The people back home in St. Louis include offensive coordinator Mike Martz
and defensive coordinators John Bunting and Peter Giunta. They are charged with
putting together the game plan anyway, with Vermeil serving as an overseer.
Vermeil will stay busy breaking down film in a video room set up at the team's
hotel.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have outstanding coaches with tremendous experience that didn't take a
14-year layoff," said Vermeil, who returned to coaching in 1997. He led
Philadelphia to the Super Bowl in the 1980 season, where it lost to Oakland.
</P>
<P>
	   Fisher plays a bigger role in comprising the game plan, but also leaves the
bulk of the work to offensive coordinator Les Steckel and defensive coordinator
Gregg Williams.
</P>
<P>
	   Fisher, like Vermeil, said he prefers the one-week break, but has no control
over it.
</P>
<P>
	   "With the extra week, you get everything done, then have the next week to
rehearse it," Fisher said. "We don't have that luxury. The coaches are working
and will continue to work and will present the game plan to the players on
Wednesday as usual.
</P>
<P>
	   "We actually may have a little more time with them here, because they aren't
going home."

<HEADLINE> Rams Capture Super Bowl Entrance  </HEADLINE>
    By R.B. FALLSTROM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- The NFL's feel-good team of the year is taking its show to
the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly after the St. Louis Rams arrived at their hotel Monday to begin
preparations for the franchise's first Super Bowl in 20 years, defensive end
Kevin Carter said the season has been almost too good to be true.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams (15-3) were 4-12 last season and entered 1999 with the NFL's worst
record of the 1990s. Kurt Warner, their MVP quarterback, was stocking grocery
store shelves five years ago, coach Dick Vermeil returned to the sideline after
a 14-year absence and star running back Marshall Faulk found new life with a new
team.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a lot of heart-warming things about this team, and I think that's
the attraction," Carter said. "We don't have a bunch of guys who were maybe
beating their wives or selling drugs. We've got a lot of good guys."
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, they were good guys toting camcorders. When the Rams walked into
the team hotel, many of them captured the moment by recording the media horde
that was watching them.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've got so many cameras going, I figure I can nab somebody's tape and get
a couple of dubs," cornerback Todd Lyght said.
</P>
<P>
	   Linebacker Todd Collins gave teammates the idea when he stood on top of his
locker stall and shot the postgame celebration scene after Sunday's 11-6 victory
over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers that set up a rematch with the Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think about 20 players have them here," Collins said. "A bunch of players
went out and bought them last night."
</P>
<P>
	   Faulk was an exception to that wide-eyed delight, saying, "Some guys want to
record everything."
</P>
<P>
	   "It's just a normal business week with more media attention, that's what it
boils down to," Faulk said. "When we get on that field, it's the same game."
</P>
<P>
	   Faulk said he often wondered whether he'd make it to the big game.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you get this opportunity to compete, to be the best in the business,
there's nothing better," Faulk said. "You always think about it, and you hold
onto your dreams of when you were a little kid."
</P>
<P>
	   The same goes for Warner.
</P>
<P>
	   "I always thought someday I'd be there," Warner said. "I always felt I would
be the guy holding the trophy when it was all said and done. I think everyone on
both teams has probably had that dream."
</P>
<P>
	   Warner held up well through a bombardment of questions, just as he has all
season. By now, it's mostly a rerun for him.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just have to, I guess, regurgitate all the answers I've given over the
last 17-18 weeks," Warner said. "It's part of it."
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams arrived with few injury problems, and kicker Jeff Wilkins' sore
left knee remained the biggest concern. Wilkins missed a 44-yard attempt Sunday,
although Vermeil said the knee had improved Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Five days before the NFC championship game, 43-year-old Nick Lowery tried
out, and he remains Vermeil's safety valve.
</P>
<P>
	   "All field goal kickers miss field goals, and I can live with that for a
short period of time," Vermeil said with a laugh. "But as I told him, the fact
that he's had a sore leg cannot be used as an excuse."

<HEADLINE> Judge Gives Questioning Go-Ahead  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge has given permission for additional
questioning in a lawsuit by former government employees whose FBI background
files were collected by the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Turning aside objections by the Clinton administration, U.S. District Judge
Royce Lamberth ruled Monday that the conservative group that filed the suit
should be permitted to question former FBI official Larry Potts about his work
for a private investigative firm that also had been retained by Clinton's legal
team in the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton's lawyers objected to questions about contacts Potts had
with the FBI since he began working for the firm, Investigative Group
International, because it would force Potts to reveal privileged communications
he had with the president's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Clinton's and Potts's argument misses the point,'' Lamberth wrote. ``Not
all discussions among a group of people ... may be entitled to claim the
privilege.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for Judicial Watch want to question Potts about whether he and IGI
investigated Linda Tripp, whose secret tape-recordings triggered the perjury and
obstruction probe of the president.
</P>
<P>
	   The conservative group also wants to question Potts about contacts he or the
investigative firm may have had with the first lady, Clinton supporter James
Carville or White House aide Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House has said that the gathering of hundreds of FBI files of
employees from past Republican administrations was a bureaucratic blunder
committed by an Army detailee to the White House.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Spy Testifies in Hearing  </HEADLINE>
   By LINDA DEUTSCH AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- With the drama of a McCarthy hearing, a former Soviet
spy was led into a room with a black bag over his head and shielded by a screen
from the audience at a Congressional hearing on Russian espionage.
</P>
<P>
	   Stanislav Lunev was the star witness at Monday's sparsely attended House
Committee on Government Reform hearing called by Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind.
</P>
<P>
	   Much of Lunev's testimony was a repeat of allegations made in his 1998 book
in which he said Russia's post-Cold War leaders still see the United States as
the enemy.
</P>
<P>
	   Lunev, who is in the federal witness protection program, said he masqueraded
as a reporter for the Russian news agency ITAR-Tass for three years during which
he scouted ``drop sites'' for weapons caches in the U.S. But he said he has no
idea if they were ever planted.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., suggested in November that the spy caches might
include suitcase-sized nuclear weapons that can produce a 10-kiloton blast.
</P>
<P>
	   Weldon, who also testified Monday, stood at one point, holding up a large
briefcase and announced: ``I have a small atomic demolition device I'd like to
bring up to you.''
</P>
<P>
	   Burton quickly reassured the audience that it was ``a mockup'' created by
the CIA.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian officials have confirmed their arsenal includes such devices, but
investigators have said there is no evidence they are part of the purported
hidden stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
	   By the time the hearing ended, no one had been able to do more than
speculate that there were ``dead drop sites'' for Russian weapons in California.
</P>
<P>
	   Burton, who said earlier there were ``many potential targets for Russian
sabotage in California,'' was questioned by reporters about his motives for the
hearings and whether he knows of actual weapons sites in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know whether there's anything like that here nor does the
administration,'' he said, but he insisted that the Russians should be asked.
</P>
<P>
	   When he returned to the hearing room, Burton said, ``Some members of the
media are indicating we might be trying to create paranoia and a new Cold War.
That's untrue. ... I'm distressed that some members of the media think we're
trying to scare everyone to death.''
</P>
<P>
	   Burton said he has repeatedly asked the White House and the State Department
to investigate the question of weapons caches but they have never responded.

lawmakers here today to press their case that the boy should be returned to his
homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   Versions of the citizenship bill were formally introduced Monday in both the
House and the Senate, and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told his
colleagues they might debate the measure as early as Wednesday. A vote Wednesday
was possible, but both sides said they doubted final action would occur until
next week at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
	   At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart declined to say what President
Clinton would do if Congress passed the bill - sign it or veto it - but said the
White House would consider the matter after Congress acts. The president has
indicated he does not believe Congress should get involved.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is a real danger here that this can become a political issue, that
this young boy will be a political football," Lockhart said. "And I think the
president has made it very clear to everyone that they ought to stay away from
politics here and stick to what the facts and the law dictate."
</P>
<P>
	   In the House, rival but unbinding legislation was introduced urging that
Elian be repatriated with his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is time to put an end to his ordeal by reuniting him with his family and
his grandparents in Cuba," said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., senior Democrat on
the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders of both parties struggled to find a consensus, which did not exist
Monday, as lawmakers returned to work from their long winter break.
</P>
<P>
	   Both parties scheduled meetings today to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides to Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., a sponsor of legislation to end the
40-year-old trade embargo with Cuba, said Elian's grandmothers, who arrived in
New York from Cuba on Friday before traveling to Washington and Miami, planned
to meet with Dodd this afternoon. They also were meeting with Rep. Joseph
Moakley, D-Mass., who believes the boy should be returned to his father,
Moakley's office said.
</P>
<P>
	   The two women flew here on Monday night by private jet after their attempt
to visit the boy in Miami failed. The boy's maternal grandmother, Raquel
Rodriguez, and paternal grandmother, Mariela Quintana, shunned an invitation to
have dinner Monday night at the home of Elian's relatives in Miami, who insisted
the meeting take place there. The grandmothers wanted to meet privately with
Elian at a neutral site.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of Elian's Miami relatives were planning to travel to Washington as
well.
</P>
<P>
	   Lott and a group of Florida lawmakers put in motion the process to bestow
citizenship on the boy, who has been cared for by the Miami relatives since he
was found clinging to an inner tube off the Florida coast on Nov. 25. His mother
and 10 other Cubans died in their ill-fated attempt to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Sponsors hoped to whisk the citizenship bill through Congress quickly,
largely to remove the case from jurisdiction of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, which has ruled that the boy should be returned to his
father on the island. Passage of the citizenship legislation also would render
moot a federal court appeal of the INS ruling by Elian's great-uncle in Miami,
sponsors said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This moves the decision-making out of the hands of the INS and into the
hands of the (state) courts," said Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., the measure's chief
Senate sponsor.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the Senate Judiciary Committee's top
Democrat, denounced the bill.
</P>
<P>
	   "For the Congress to grant citizenship to a young boy over the father's
objection makes a mockery of family values and it hands Castro yet another
reason to portray the United States as the enemy," Leahy said. Cuban President
Fidel Castro's government has sponsored a series of mass demonstrations
demanding the boy's repatriation.
</P>
<P>
	   Bestowing American citizenship is a power Congress uses rarely.
</P>
<P>
	   It gave citizenship to Winston Churchill and Mother Teresa and posthumously
to Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat who saved tens of thousands of Hungarian
Jews in World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   But congressional involvement in individual immigration cases has declined
sharply in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
	   Some high-profile examples:
</P>
<P>
	   -In July 1997, Swiss bank guard Christoph Meili won permanent residency
status. He had lost his job after saving Holocaust-era bank documents from a
shredder.
</P>
<P>
	   -In 1968, three men - from Italy, Ireland and Germany - who died while
fighting with American units in Vietnam, posthumously received U.S. citizenship.
</P>
<P>
	   -In 1988, Michael Wilding, the son of actress Elizabeth Taylor and a former
stepson of Sen. John Warner, R-Va., won citizenship. The British subject had
renounced his U.S. citizenship in 1971, and the bill blocked a possible
deportation on a marijuana possession conviction.

<HEADLINE> Nor'easter pounds N.J. - with up to a foot of snow in forecast  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A powerful nor'easter walloped New Jersey with a
heavy windblown snowfall early today, creating dangerous travel conditions and
forcing widespread cancelations.
<P>
	   The National Weather Service predicted that up to a foot of snow would fall
by evening. Meteorologist Anthony Gigi said visibility was less than a mile
statewide after the snow began falling in the predawn hours.
</P>
<P>
	   The horizontal snowfall created hazardous driving conditions even for snow
plow drivers. John Dalrymple, 21, who was busy before dawn operating a private
snow plow in Mays Landing, said even he was forced to slow down along U.S. Route
40.
</P>
<P>
	   About four inches of snow fell in southern New Jersey in just a few hours
this morning.
</P>
<P>
	   "It just keeps coming," Dalrymple said. "As soon as you plow somewhere, you
have to go back and plow what you've already plowed."
</P>
<P>
	   The storm forced the cancelation of many schools and the closing of
businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Newark International Airport was still open in the morning, but departing
flights were delayed by one hour, said Port Authority police officer Vinny
Zapula.
</P>
<P>
	   Seton Hall University postponed its memorial service for the three freshman
who died in last week's dormitory fire. The service has been rescheduled for
Thursday at 10 a.m. All classes at Seton Hall are canceled today, a spokeswoman
said.
</P>
<P>
	   McGuire Air Force Base declared a "Phase A" alert, indicating that only
personnel necessary to maintain limited air operations should report for duty.
</P>
<P>
	   A winter storm warning remained in effect. Gigi said the snow could turn to
sleet or rain along the coast later. He said between 10 and 12 inches of snow
would fall throughout the rest of the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Skies were expected to clear by evening.

<HEADLINE> Mayor sends 1,200 plows to move the snow  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - New Yorkers struggled to work and school this morning as
an expected 6 to 8 inches of snow, sleet, rain and wind began to buffet the
city.
<P>
	   More than 1,500 snow-clearing vehicles and an army of workers were sent out
to clean the streets.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you see a sanitation worker out there, tell him 'thank you,' because
they've been out there working all morning," Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said by
telephone from his home.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor was meeting with officials from the Office of Emergency
Management, but no OEM intervention was likely.
</P>
<P>
	   The sanitation department dispatched 1,200 snow plows and 353 salt trucks at
5:30 a.m., when the first snowflakes fell. It expected to use more than 5,000
tons of salt throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
	   LaGuardia Airport was closed at 7 a.m. because of the weather, Port
Authority police said. Kennedy International Airport was experiencing delays of
about an hour on all flights.
</P>
<P>
	   Departing flights at Newark Airport in New Jersey were delayed an hour.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning for the city and
its suburbs to the north and west. It said residents of Rockland and Westchester
counties were in line for up to 9 inches of snow.
</P>
<P>
	   A winter weather advisory was issued for eastern Long Island, where 4 inches
of snow was expected.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani urged city workers and students to use mass transit. He said he
expected a slow and difficult commute into the city but a more treacherous one
out in the afternoon and evening.
</P>
<P>
	   He pleaded for workers to think about staggering the times they planned to
head home to avoid clogging buses and trains.
</P>
<P>
	   Temperatures were expected to hover around 25 or 30 degrees in the
metropolitan area throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
	   There were numerous reports of minor traffic accidents throughout the city
and its suburbs.

<HEADLINE> Funerals held for 3 who died in Seton Hall fire; weather postpones  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   LONG BRANCH, N.J. (AP) - The grief-stricken friends and family of three
Seton Hall University freshmen who died in a dormitory fire gathered Monday to
mourn and wonder why.
<P>
	   But there were no answers. Not at St. Jerome Roman Catholic Church, where
Frank S. Caltabilota Jr. was remembered in a 90-minute Mass.
</P>
<P>
	   Not at St. Francis of Assisi in Vineland, where John Giunta was laid to
rest.
</P>
<P>
	   And not at St. John the Evangelist Roman Catholic Church in Dunellen, where
Aaron Karol was remembered as a "near-perfect kid."
</P>
<P>
	   "Today our faith cannot answer the question why," the Rev. William Sheridan,
assistant director of campus ministry at Seton Hall, told mourners in Vineland.
"Why did three die? Why did John die? Why?"
</P>
<P>
	   Caltabilota, of West Long Branch, was a three-sport standout at Shore
Regional High School who aspired to a career in medicine. An honor student, he
compared himself in his Seton Hall application essay to a basketball player who
chooses to pass to an open teammate instead of shooting the ball himself.
</P>
<P>
	   "My school counselor says that I am a natural caretaker. Maybe she's right,"
he wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 800 people filled St. Jerome for the service.
</P>
<P>
	   Caltabilota's girlfriend, Erin Brown, 18, had to pause several times during
a five-minute eulogy to gather herself. "You touched the lives of so many
people, even if you'd only known them five minutes," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Dunellen, about 450 people crowded into St. John the Evangelist Roman
Catholic Church to say goodbye to Karol, of Green Brook, a soccer enthusiast and
criminal justice major who hoped someday to work for the FBI.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was just an all-round, near-perfect kid," said Jimmy Byrnes, 17, a
soccer teammate at Watchung Hills Regional High School. "He had everything -
sports, popularity, smarts."
</P>
<P>
	   Weeping teen-agers carried the coffin down the aisle, followed by Karol's
family.
</P>
<P>
	   "Learn from the loss of this young man how precious life is," said the Rev.
John Morley, a Seton Hall priest. "And it does not come with guarantees."
</P>
<P>
	   In Vineland, about 500 people - including three busloads of Seton Hall
students - turned out for Giunta's funeral Mass at St. Francis of Assisi Roman
Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
	   Giunta, an elementary education major who aspired to teaching in the inner
city, was remembered as a generous, loyal guy with a great future.
</P>
<P>
	   "He seemed like he had a dream ahead of him. He knew what he wanted to do,"
said John Henderson, 21, of Vineland, a high school classmate.
</P>
<P>
	   Classmates consoled each other, holding hands or patting one another on the
back.
</P>
<P>
	   "We say that Seton Hall is a family, and it is," said Seton Hall chancellor
Thomas Peterson, who spoke at Karol's funeral Mass. "We, like yourselves, have
lost a son."
</P>
<P>
	   There were prayers for the three elsewhere, too.
</P>
<P>
	   -In Rome, a group of American priests at the Vatican offered Mass for the
victims Monday, Morley said. One of the priests was a former Seton Hall faculty
member.
</P>
<P>
	   -In Washington, U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg read a resolution honoring the
three on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
	   -In Trenton, Gov. Christie Whitman departed from the prepared text of her
annual budget message to say, "We want the families to know they are in our
hearts and in our prayers."
</P>
<P>
	   At Seton Hall, meanwhile, some freshmen returned to their rooms at Boland
Hall for the first time since the fire.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents of the first two floors were allowed to move back into their
rooms, while third, fourth and fifth floor residents were relocated, university
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   A memorial service scheduled for today on the South Orange campus was
postponed as a major snowstorm hit the East Coast. It was rescheduled for
Thursday at 10 a.m. Classes were to resume this afternoon, but they too were
called off.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire broke out around 4:30 a.m. Wednesday on the third floor of Boland
Hall, a six-story dormitory that housed 640 people. Five remain hospitalized,
four in critical condition with burns.

	   "It just keeps coming," Dalrymple said. "As soon as you plow somewhere, you
have to go back and plow what you've already plowed."
</P>
<P>
	   Farther north, cars crawled on snow-covered highways, weaving in the middle
of lanes because snow had covered the markers dividing them. The speed limit on
the New Jersey Turnpike was reduced to 35 mph.
</P>
<P>
	   Pedestrians hunkered down in the streets with umbrellas that were useless
against the snow because wind drove it into their faces.
</P>
<P>
	   The wind was the worst part about this storm, said Luis Garcia of Newark.
"It blows the snow onto the windshield and it stays there," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can't move," said James Lyles of Hillside. "It hampers your mobility."
The Postal Service worker dusted snow off the windshield of his car in Newark
after finishing an overnight shift and preparing to drive home.
</P>
<P>
	   Yvette Manning was ready for the weather, standing outside Penn Station in
Newark in a wool hat and heavy coat.
</P>
<P>
	   "I prayed for it, because I like the snow," said Manning, 34, of Jersey
City. She also said she prayed to leave work early today so she could go home
and play with her son.
</P>
<P>
	   Franc Holonics plowed the driveway of his East Windsor home a little before
6 a.m., and then he and his brother, Dave, prepared to head north in a pickup
truck and a sport utility vehicle to clear snow from business parking lots and
driveways in northern New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   "I haven't the foggiest how long we'll be out today," he said. "It could be
all day. They say we'll get sort of a slingshot effect with the snow coming off
the ocean."
</P>
<P>
	   He estimated they would make $400 to $500 in a few hours - more if heavy
snow kept them out longer. "It could be a pretty good day," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm forced the cancellation of schools and the closing of many
businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Department of Transportation mobilized about 1,700 plows and 2,000
workers to clear roads. The crews were concentrating first on major highways,
said department spokesman John Dourgarian.
</P>
<P>
	   NJ Transit buses and trains were operating close to schedule this morning,
though commuters should allow extra time, said NJ Transit spokeswoman Penny
Bassett Hackett.
</P>
<P>
	   Newark International Airport was still open, but departing flights were

<HEADLINE> Intense swirling snowstorm pummels metropolitan area  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Swirling snow from an intense winter storm today closed
hundreds of schools and LaGuardia Airport, turned roads to slippery seas of
slush and made the commute for metropolitan residents a nightmare.
<P>
	   And that was the good news.
</P>
<P>
	   New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani warned that getting home would be even
tougher.
</P>
<P>
	   For John Keating, an iron worker from Orange County who sat on a bus for
more than 2 hours getting into the city, that came sooner than he expected. He
got to his construction job at the Queensborough Bridge only to find out, "They
shut the job down. I've come in. I'll turn around and I'll go home."
</P>
<P>
	   Jose Maldonado, who runs a street side coffee cart near Grand Central
Station, was ready to pack it in, too - at 7:30 a.m. With snowflakes coating his
eyelashes and covering his oversized umbrella, Maldonado said, "You've got to be
practical. Look at the way this is coming down. Who's going to stop in this?"
</P>
<P>
	   Weather officials predicted the storm would hit the metropolitan area
midweek but it developed more quickly than expected.
</P>
<P>
	   "We knew it was coming. It just decided to hit us a day earlier," said
National Weather Service meteorologist Tim Morrin. "It's an intense winter
storm, about as intense as we thought it could be and it's hitting us with its
full potential."
</P>
<P>
	   LaGuardia was closed at 7 a.m. and delays of up to 90 minutes were reported
at Kennedy and Newark airports. There were scattered 10- to 15-minute delays on
both the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North commuter lines, but no major
early morning problems were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Weather officials were predicting 4 to 6 inches in New York City and Nassau
County on Long Island and 2 to 4 inches in Suffolk County. The northern suburbs
and northern New Jersey were expected to be hardest hit - 6 to 9 inches. The
snow was expected to taper off by midday with periodic flurries expected into
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Early morning commuters who tried to get a jump on the storm got into the
city only to wait in long taxi queues at both the Port Authority and Grand
Central terminals.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm sorry I came in," said Susan LaRaus, who spent two hours getting into
Port Authority from New Brunswick, N.J. "I'm leaving early, absolutely."
</P>
<P>
	   New York City's 1,100 public schools remained open, although hundreds of
private and Catholic schools in the city - and suburban public schools - were
closed.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanitation workers, operating more than 1,500 snowplows and salt spreaders,
hit city streets shortly after the first flakes stuck to the ground around 5:30
a.m. The city expected to use 5,000 tons of salt on streets and highways.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you see a sanitation worker out there tell him thank you because they've
been out there working all morning," the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani urged employers to stagger closing times today, so the subways,
buses and commuter lines can handle an extra, early passenger load.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'Isn't She Great'  </HEADLINE>
    By CHRISTY LEMIRE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   "Isn't She Great" isn't great, but it is colorful and fun and has some good
laughs.
</P>
<P>
	   The film tells the story of Jacqueline Susann, author of "Valley of the
Dolls," the controversial 1966 novel about promiscuous, pill-popping actresses.
All she ever wanted was to be famous, and after several failures on stage, radio
and television, Susann finally finds her place in the spotlight with this racy
book.
</P>
<P>
	   Bette Midler plays Jackie, and is the perfect choice to portray the author's
outrageous life. All big hair and wild clothing and snappy one-liners, Midler,
like Jackie, is larger than life.
</P>
<P>
	   Nathan Lane plays Irving Mansfield, Jackie's manager and husband, whose
constant exclamations of "Isn't she great?" inspired the title. He sees a talent
in Jackie that no one else sees, and each is the other's most loyal fan.
</P>
<P>
	   The film follows Jackie as she struggles for stardom, then writes "Valley of
the Dolls" and goes on a cross-country book-selling tour with Irving, her poodle
and her publicist in tow. It also shows her battle with breast cancer, of which
she died in 1974, and her efforts to hide her affliction from the public.
</P>
<P>
	   The screenplay from Paul Rudnick ("In &AMP; Out") is based on an article Michael
Korda wrote about Jacqueline Susann for "The New Yorker." Andrew Bergman, who
directed "The Freshman" and "Honeymoon in Vegas" and wrote "Fletch" and
"Soapdish," is the director. Like their previous films, "Isn't She Great" has a
sort of wacky energy and several good jokes.
</P>
<P>
	   When Irving and Jackie first meet and are trying to impress each other, he
tells her, "Do you know Perry Como? I handle his brother."
</P>
<P>
	   Later, when Jackie seeks feedback on her first draft of "Valley of the
Dolls," Irving exclaims, "It's like 'Madame Bovary."'
</P>
<P>
	   "Name a real book," she responds.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's like 'Gone With the Wind,' only filthy," Irving says.
</P>
<P>
	   Midler and Lane bounce off each other beautifully, and the script highlights
both actors' superb comedic timing.
</P>
<P>
	   Stockard Channing gets some of the best lines of all as Jackie's close
friend, Florence.
</P>
<P>
	   Early in the film, when Jackie laments her acting failures, Florence tries
to encourage her by saying, "It can happen to you. Talent isn't everything."
Chain smoking and swilling martinis, Channing also gets to wear the best clothes
in the film -- stylish suits and huge hats, usually adorned with fur or
feathers.
</P>
<P>
	   David Hyde Pierce plays Michael, Jackie's uptight book editor. But it's a
role we've seen him do before -- just check him out his character Niles on TV's
"Frasier."
</P>
<P>
	   Unfortunately, the script is little more than a series of one-liners. We
don't learn much about Jackie beyond her yearnings for fame, her expensive
tastes and her love for Irving. The couple has an autistic son, whom they send
to a special school, and the two scenes in which they visit him feel forced and
out of place.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the time, there is no sense that we are watching real people as they
would truly interact with one another. They're fun to watch, but they seem
self-consciously on display.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, the original music from Burt Bacharach is too heavy-handed during the
sappy moments. His wistful horns seem to pipe in at all the feel-good times,
trying to wring every bit of emotion from the audience.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton raises gender issue in explaining criticism  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton said today that part of the
reason some people have such strong feelings against her may be because she is a
woman, or it could be her hairdo.
<P>
	   During a morning interview with Albany's WGY-AM radio, the expected Senate
candidate was told that "in certain circles, just mention your name and you've
got foaming at the mouth."
</P>
<P>
	   After momentary laughter from Mrs. Clinton, WGY's morning show host, Don
Weeks, asked if Mrs. Clinton "ever tried to understand that venom and does it
bother you?"
</P>
<P>
	   "I know that it's out there and I think some of it is because of the
positions that I've taken and maybe a little of it is because I'm a woman taking
those positions," the first lady said. "And, maybe some of it is people don't
like my hair style. I don't know what it is."
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton said she has received a "very warm welcome" from her new
neighbors in suburban Westchester County, but that she has "taken every chance I
could to apologize to my neighbors because there are satellite trucks and errant
press people tromping through their backyards with their telephoto lenses.
</P>
<P>
	   "Don't tell anybody this, but I don't have any curtains yet so, gosh, I
don't know what they might be seeing," she added.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton also stole a phrase out of her husband's dog-eared campaign
play book as she discussed her adopted state's high energy costs, stiff property
taxes and hefty in-state airfares.
</P>
<P>
	   "Now that I'm a resident, I can share your pain," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton's comments came the morning after she and her expected Senate
rival, Rudolph Giuliani, missed each other by just a few hours in Albany. They
did manage to take swipes at each other in passing.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. George Pataki and other Republican allies of the New York City mayor
accused Mrs. Clinton of trying to upstage the mayor on Monday as he made his
annual pilgrimage to Albany seeking more state aid for the city.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady arrived a couple of hours later to meet with Democratic
members of the state Legislature and mingle with gay rights activists.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no question in my mind that the first lady chose today to come
because she doesn't want people to hear the positive message of the successful
record of Mayor Giuliani," Pataki said at a news conference with the mayor by
his side.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady's camp denied any such motive and she said at a state Capitol
news conference that "at last count, I've been in upstate New York more than 30
times and I have never run into the mayor."
</P>
<P>
	   Patricia Lynch, a spokeswoman for state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver,
said the invitation from Silver to Mrs. Clinton went out "several months ago."
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm just here working today at my full-time job being mayor of New York
City," Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm looking for political support," Mrs. Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a day for trading charges.
</P>
<P>
	   At a Monday morning stop in Westchester County where she now lives, Mrs.
Clinton said the mayor's fund raising showed that if he were elected to the
Senate he would be "beholden to the far right of the Republican Party and fringe
groups."
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani laughed.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're doing the right-wing conspiracy again? That's deja vu all over
again," the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
	   Before President Clinton admitted to lying about his sexual relationship
with Monica Lewinsky, Mrs. Clinton had blamed a "vast, right-wing conspiracy"
for her husband's problems.

<HEADLINE> Nor'easter pounds N.J. - with up to a foot of snow in forecast  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A powerful nor'easter walloped New Jersey with a
heavy windblown snowfall early today, creating dangerous travel conditions and
forcing widespread cancellations.
<P>
	   The National Weather Service predicted that up to a foot of snow would fall
by evening. Meteorologist Anthony Gigi said visibility was less than a mile
statewide after the snow began falling in the predawn hours.
</P>
<P>
	   Snow had tapered off by midmorning in southern and central portions of the
state, but was expected to pick up again during the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   The coastal areas of southern New Jersey were expected to bear the brunt of
the storm, said National Weather Service meteorologist Roy Miller. By
midmorning, up to 8 inches had fallen already in some parts, he said. Wind gusts
of up to 60 mph and abnormally high tides were forecast for tonight in coastal
areas.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is probably the most snow that we've had since I guess the 1996
storm," Miller said.
</P>
<P>
	   That blizzard dumped up to 30 inches of snow in New Jersey and across the
street, crippling the state for two days.
</P>
<P>
	   The horizontal snowfall created hazardous driving conditions even for snow
plow drivers. John Dalrymple, 21, who was busy before dawn operating a private
snow plow in Mays Landing, said even he was forced to slow down along U.S. Route
40.
</P>
<P>
	   "It just keeps coming," Dalrymple said. "As soon as you plow somewhere, you
have to go back and plow what you've already plowed."
</P>
<P>
	   Farther north, cars crawled on snow-covered highways, weaving in the middle
of lanes because snow had covered the markers dividing them. The speed limit on
the New Jersey Turnpike was reduced to 35 mph. The Atlantic City Expressway also
imposed a 35 mph speed restriction.
</P>
<P>
	   Pedestrians hunkered down in the streets with umbrellas that were useless
against the snow because wind drove it into their faces.
</P>
<P>
	   The wind was the worst part about this storm, said Luis Garcia of Newark.
"It blows the snow onto the windshield and it stays there," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can't move," said James Lyles of Hillside. "It hampers your mobility."
The Postal Service worker dusted snow off the windshield of his car in Newark
after finishing an overnight shift and preparing to drive home.
</P>
<P>
	   Yvette Manning was ready for the weather, standing outside Penn Station in
Newark in a wool hat and heavy coat.
</P>
<P>
	   "I prayed for it, because I like the snow," said Manning, 34, of Jersey
City. She also said she prayed to leave work early today so she could go home
and play with her son.
</P>
<P>
	   Franc Holonics plowed the driveway of his East Windsor home a little before
6 a.m., and then he and his brother, Dave, prepared to head north in a pickup
truck and a sport utility vehicle to clear snow from business parking lots and
driveways in northern New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   "I haven't the foggiest how long we'll be out today," he said. "It could be
all day. They say we'll get sort of a slingshot effect with the snow coming off
the ocean."
</P>
<P>
	   He estimated they would make $400 to $500 in a few hours - more if heavy
snow kept them out longer. "It could be a pretty good day," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm forced the cancellation of schools statewide. State offices and
many businesses also were closed.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Department of Transportation mobilized about 1,700 plows and 2,000
workers to clear roads. The crews were concentrating first on major highways,
said department spokesman John Dourgarian.
</P>
<P>
	   NJ Transit buses and trains were operating close to schedule this morning,
though commuters should allow extra time, said NJ Transit spokeswoman Penny
Bassett Hackett.
</P>
<P>
	   Newark International Airport was still open, but most morning flights were
canceled, said Steve Coleman, spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   Seton Hall University postponed its memorial service for the three freshmen
who died in last week's dormitory fire. The service has been rescheduled for
Thursday at 10 a.m. All classes at Seton Hall were canceled, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
	   McGuire Air Force Base declared a "Phase A" alert, indicating that only
personnel necessary to maintain limited air operations should report for duty.
</P>
<P>
	   A winter storm warning remained in effect. Gigi said the snow could turn to
sleet or rain along the coast later. He said between 10 and 12 inches of snow
would fall throughout the rest of the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Skies were expected to clear by evening.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Up 47.47  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed at the start of trading today, with
blue-chip stocks edging back from Monday's steep decline on the strength of
corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 47.47 at 11,055.64.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up
6.67 at 1,408.58, and the Nasdaq composite index was down 4.38 at 4,091.70.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks moved higher in volatile trading as investors once again balanced
strong corporate profits with the fear of higher interest rates, which could
eventually cut into companies' profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Procter &AMP; Gamble rose 4 1/2 to 100 1/2. The company's stock price, which
tumbled last week as P&AMP;G held talks to acquire drug companies Warner-Lambert and
American Home Products, began its recovery yesterday after company officials
called off the talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, P&AMP;G posted fiscal second-quarter earnings that beat analysts'
expectations, providing further punch to the stock.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, Disney rose 4 1/2 to 37 after its earnings report topped expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   Trading was fairly volatile as investors contemplated next week's Federal
Reserve meeting. Central bankers are expected to raise interest rates a
quarter-percentage point, but many economists fear that increase next week will
be the first of several as the central bank works to hold off inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 133.60 million shares, behind Monday's
early pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.47 to 520.48.

	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.9 percent. In afternoon
trading, Germany's DAX index was down 0.9 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down
1.1 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Eyes Debt Payment by 2013  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will propose a budget plan next month
to pay off the government's $3.6 trillion publicly held debt by 2013, two years
sooner than expected, the White House said today.
</P>
<P>
	   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart offered no details of the president's
proposal, but said ``obviously the strong economy'' had provided the resources
to pay the debt down more quickly. He said Clinton's plan would devote the
interest savings to Social Security, allowing the program to remain solvent
beyond 2050.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The budget for 2001 will put America in a position to pay off the $3.6
trillion debt by 2013,'' Lockhart said. ``It's quite important that the
president will put a budget in place that will actually pay down the debt even
sooner than we thought we could. It would be the first time we've been debt-free
in this country since 1835.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans in Congress also are talking more about using the massive
revenues coming into the Treasury to eliminate the $3.6 trillion publicly held
federal debt rather than try again for a massive tax cut similar to the one
vetoed by Clinton last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The total federal debt is $5.76 trillion, including the $2 billion held by
large government trust funds, primarily the Social Security Trust Fund.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's proposal comes amid an election-year battle between Democrats and
Republicans over how much black ink there will be. That battle was touched off
by an unusual decision by Congress' top budget analyst to produce three separate
surplus estimates.
</P>
<P>
	   Dan Crippen, director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, is
expected to release three surplus projections for the coming decade on
Wednesday. The figure Congress ultimately chooses will determine how much money
is available for tax cuts, spending increases and debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats are expected to embrace the smallest of three projections. That
total, for the 10 years ending 2010, will be roughly $1 trillion excluding
Social Security, say congressional aides speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans have not decided what to do, but many of them -- including the
Senate Budget Committee chairman, Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M. -- seem likely to
endorse a projection totaling about $2 trillion over the period, aides said.
That is about double what CBO projected last year, a figure that has grown
because of the persistently strong economy.
</P>
<P>
	   CBO will also release a third projection which, though arrived at
differently, also foresees about $2 trillion in black ink, aides said.
</P>
<P>
	   It is unusual for CBO to produce multiple surplus estimates without
endorsing one as the figure it believes most valid. CBO's decision to release
three projections highlights the immense political pressure on the agency as the
two parties vie over rival visions of how to use the government's projected
extra cash.
</P>
<P>
	   The figure Democrats like assumes that the one-third of the $1.7 trillion
federal budget that Congress must approve every year will grow annually at the
rate of inflation. That one-third of the budget covers everything but
automatically paid benefits like Social Security and interest on the federal
debt.
</P>
<P>
	   That option assumes the most spending -- with less money left over for the
GOP's proposed tax cuts -- than any of CBO's alternatives. It also most nearly
approaches what has actually happened in recent years, as lawmakers have
consistently increased spending for defense and many domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The number many Republicans like assumes that the money spent on that
one-third of the budget will remain frozen at roughly $620 billion, about what
is being spent this year. It assumes less spending than Democrats would like,
with more money left over for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   The third option assumes that spending limits on this portion of the budget
will be obeyed. These limits have been surpassed for the past two years by tens
of billions of dollars annually, and are virtually certain to be ignored again
this coming year. This calculation assumes bigger surpluses for the next few
years, but smaller surpluses in later years than the assumption Republicans will
use.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Republicans like the second option because it allows room for big tax
cuts over the decade, but does not make the unrealistic assumption that the
spending limits will be obeyed.
</P>
<P>
	   In the fiscal 2001 budget he introduces next month, President Clinton is
expected to embrace a surplus estimate that is a bit more generous than the $1
trillion figure congressional Democrats are expected to use.

<HEADLINE> Feds To Watch Foster Care Agencies  </HEADLINE>
   By KAREN GULLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government will closely monitor state child
welfare agencies for the first time, holding them accountable if children are
abused or neglected in foster care and making sure permanent foster homes are
found quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   New rules that take effect in March give the Department of Health and Human
Services much broader monitoring responsibility over state agencies that provide
foster care, adoption and family services to low-income children.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of reviewing case files, which it had done in the past, the
department will do on-site reviews at agencies. The department will seek
extensive information about instances of child abuse in foster care homes and
efforts to recruit adoptive parents and interview children, parents and foster
parents.
</P>
<P>
	   HHS will also monitor state's adherence to new rules barring discrimination
against adoptive or foster care parents seeking to adopt children of another
race.
</P>
<P>
	   The department can withhold up to 14 percent of a state's federal funds each
year if agencies are doing a poor job ensuring child safety and haven't
corrected problems. However, the penalties won't be taken from money that goes
to foster families caring for children.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are taking a real step toward ensuring that vulnerable children will be
able to live safely, in permanent and loving homes,'' said HHS Secretary Donna
Shalala.
</P>
<P>
	   The rules, announced today, underpin new foster care and adoption laws that
put child safety ahead of family preservation. The laws were passed in response
to concerns over cases of gross abuse and neglect of children in foster care
homes supervised by state agencies.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 540,000 children are in foster care -- many removed from their
homes because of abuse and neglect. Most return to their parents, but more than
100,000 stay in foster care because family problems are still a threat to their
safety.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of these children need special assistance in finding homes because they
are older or have physical, mental or emotional disabilities.
</P>
<P>
	   The costs are shared by the federal government and the states. Last year the
federal share was estimated at $4 billion, with states paying $3.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   HHS will review agencies in 10 states this year and another 17 states in
2001. States out of compliance must correct problems within two years and will
be monitored quarterly.

<HEADLINE> Intense swirling snowstorm pummels metropolitan area  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Swirling snow from an intense winter storm today closed
hundreds of schools and LaGuardia Airport, turned roads to slippery seas of
slush and made the commute for metropolitan residents a nightmare.
<P>
	   And that was the good news.
</P>
<P>
	   New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani warned that getting home would be even
tougher.
</P>
<P>
	   For John Keating, an iron worker from Orange County who sat on a bus for
more than 2 hours getting into the city, that came sooner than he expected. He
got to his construction job at the Queensborough Bridge only to find out, "They
shut the job down. I've come in. I'll turn around and I'll go home."
</P>
<P>
	   Snowfall in Central Park measured 4.5 inches by mid-morning, as white fluff
began turning into a mixture of light sleet and rain.
</P>
<P>
	   Periodic flurries were predicted through Wednesday. The northern suburbs
were expected to be hardest hit with 6 to 9 inches of snow.
</P>
<P>
	   Snowplows hit the roads shortly after the first flakes began to stick to the
ground around 5:30 a.m. The city expected to use 5,000 tons of salt on streets
and highways.
</P>
<P>
	   Weather officials predicted the storm would hit the metropolitan area
midweek but it developed more quickly than expected.
</P>
<P>
	   "We knew it was coming. It just decided to hit us a day earlier," said
National Weather Service meteorologist Tim Morrin. "It's an intense winter
storm, about as intense as we thought it could be and it's hitting us with its
full potential."
</P>
<P>
	   LaGuardia was closed at 7 a.m. and although Kennedy and Newark remained
open, most morning flights out of those airports were cancelled by the airlines,
said Port Authority of New York and New Jersey spokesman Bill Cahill.
</P>
<P>
	   Cahill predicted there would be many delays and cancellations throughout the
day.
</P>
<P>
	   But Joao Nemeth, visiting from Brazil, already knew that. Nemeth, along with
his wife, two daughters, grandmother and grandfather, showed up at LaGuardia for
a 7:40 a.m. flight to Orlando, Fla., only to find the airport closed.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we didn't pick the best day for flying," he said, as he tried to
comfort his disappointed 11-year-old who was eager to get to Disney World.
</P>
<P>
	   Although inconvenienced, the Nemeth family experienced something new - their
first snowstorm. "They are enjoying it very well," he said. "It's something very
different. It's beautiful, really."
</P>
<P>
	   There was agreement from Janie Barnett, sipping coffee at a Brooklyn deli
after a hectic morning that included coercing her crying daughter - who wanted
to stay home and play in the snow - to go to school.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the whole world would just cancel life on a day like this, it would be
fine," said Barnett. "It's only the stress of trying to maintain your normal
life on a day like this that makes everybody crazy. Otherwise, we'd all be
happy, because it's glorious."
</P>
<P>
	   At the Thruway Diner in suburban New Rochelle, Jon Landers took a momentary
reprieve, sipping both a cup of coffee and a cup of hot chocolate. "Two-fisted
drinker," he said, explaining, "It's cold out there."
</P>
<P>
	   While morning commuters crawled their way to work on snow-clogged highways
and in overcrowded buses and subways, many were already looking to make an early
escape.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm sorry I came in," said Susan LaRaus, who spent two hours getting into
Port Authority from New Brunswick, N.J. "I'm leaving early, absolutely."
</P>
<P>
	   New York City's 1,100 public schools remained open but attendance was
lighter than usual, said Board of Education spokeswoman Margie Feinberg.
</P>
<P>
	   After-school and evening programs in the public schools were cancelled and
hundreds of private and Catholic schools in the city - and suburban public
schools - were closed as well.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor urged employers to stagger closing times today, so the subways,
buses and commuter lines can handle an extra, early passenger load.
</P>
<P>
	   While some could do without the snowy wonderland, Rudolph Williams surveyed
the slushy street from his doorman's perch at an Upper West Side building and
declared, "We need more snow. It adds beauty to this place. It adds life. It's
creative. ... This here is a winter's work of art!"

<HEADLINE> Nor'easter pounds N.J. - with up to a foot of snow in forecast  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A powerful nor'easter walloped New Jersey with a
heavy windblown snowfall early today, creating dangerous travel conditions and
forcing widespread cancellations.
<P>
	   The National Weather Service predicted that up to a foot of snow would fall
by evening. Meteorologist Anthony Gigi said visibility was less than a mile
statewide after the snow began falling in the predawn hours.
</P>
<P>
	   Snow had tapered off by midmorning in southern and central portions of the
state, but was expected to pick up again during the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   The coastal areas of southern New Jersey were expected to bear the brunt of
the storm, said National Weather Service meteorologist Roy Miller. Wind gusts of
up to 60 mph and abnormally high tides were forecast for tonight in coastal
areas.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey Turnpike Authority spokesman Thomas Suszka said that 10.25 inches
of snow fell in Deepwater, Salem County, near the Delaware Memorial Bridge.
Accumulations were about 5.5 inches in northern New Jersey, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The snow had changed to rain in the north by 11:30 a.m., Suszka said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is probably the most snow that we've had since I guess the 1996
storm," Miller said.
</P>
<P>
	   That blizzard dumped up to 30 inches of snow in New Jersey and across the
street, crippling the state for two days.
</P>
<P>
	   The horizontal snowfall created hazardous driving conditions even for snow
plow drivers. John Dalrymple, 21, who was busy before dawn operating a private
snow plow in Mays Landing, said even he was forced to slow down along U.S. Route
40.
</P>
<P>
	   "It just keeps coming," Dalrymple said. "As soon as you plow somewhere, you
have to go back and plow what you've already plowed."
</P>
<P>
	   Farther north, cars crawled on snow-covered highways, weaving in the middle
of lanes because snow had covered the markers dividing them. The speed limit on
the New Jersey Turnpike was reduced to 35 mph. The Atlantic City Expressway also
imposed a 35 mph speed restriction.
</P>
<P>
	   Pedestrians hunkered down in the streets with umbrellas that were useless
against the snow because wind drove it into their faces.
</P>
<P>
	   The wind was the worst part about this storm, said Luis Garcia of Newark.
"It blows the snow onto the windshield and it stays there," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can't move," said James Lyles of Hillside. "It hampers your mobility."
The Postal Service worker dusted snow off the windshield of his car in Newark
after finishing an overnight shift and preparing to drive home.
</P>
<P>
	   Yvette Manning was ready for the weather, standing outside Penn Station in
Newark in a wool hat and heavy coat.
</P>
<P>
	   "I prayed for it, because I like the snow," said Manning, 34, of Jersey
City. She also said she prayed to leave work early today so she could go home
and play with her son.
</P>
<P>
	   Franc Holonics plowed the driveway of his East Windsor home a little before
6 a.m., and then he and his brother, Dave, prepared to head north in a pickup
truck and a sport utility vehicle to clear snow from business parking lots and
driveways in northern New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   "I haven't the foggiest how long we'll be out today," he said. "It could be
all day. They say we'll get sort of a slingshot effect with the snow coming off
the ocean."
</P>
<P>
	   He estimated they would make $400 to $500 in a few hours - more if heavy
snow kept them out longer. "It could be a pretty good day," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm forced the cancellation of schools statewide. State offices and
many businesses also were closed.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Department of Transportation mobilized about 1,700 plows and 2,000
workers to clear roads. The crews were concentrating first on major highways,
said department spokesman John Dourgarian.
</P>
<P>
	   NJ Transit buses and trains were operating close to schedule this morning,
though commuters should allow extra time, said NJ Transit spokeswoman Penny
Bassett Hackett.
</P>
<P>
	   Newark International Airport was still open, but most morning flights were
canceled, said Steve Coleman, spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   Seton Hall University postponed its memorial service for the three freshmen
who died in last week's dormitory fire. The service has been rescheduled for
Thursday at 10 a.m. All classes at Seton Hall were canceled, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
	   McGuire Air Force Base declared a "Phase A" alert, indicating that only
personnel necessary to maintain limited air operations should report for duty.
</P>
<P>
	   A winter storm warning remained in effect. Gigi said the snow could turn to
sleet or rain along the coast later. He said between 10 and 12 inches of snow
would fall throughout the rest of the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Skies were expected to clear by evening.

<HEADLINE> Bush supporters knock McCain off ballot in two districts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Local election officials have knocked Sen. John
McCain off the March 7 Republican presidential Primary ballot in at least two
New York congressional districts.
<P>
	   Matt Graves, a spokesman for the New York City Board of Elections, said
today that McCain's presidential petitions for the 16th congressional district
in the South Bronx were thrown out.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain also was disqualified in a congressional district in Suffolk County
on Long Island and faces disqualification in another district that covers
counties in New York City, Queens and Brooklyn, said Jeff Buley, a lawyer
working for the Republican State Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain will not challenge the Bronx and Suffolk County disqualifications in
court, McCain campaign lawyer Henry Berger said. However, any other possible
disqualification will probably be challenged, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   With polls showing McCain running ahead of Bush in New Hampshire, the battle
over the New York primary ballot has taken on extra significance.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, GOP candidates must get a certain number of signatures from
party members to qualify for separate convention delegate slates in each of the
state's 31 congressional districts in which they wish to compete. In effect,
there are 31 separate GOP primaries in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   State Republican leaders, who support Texas Gov. George W. Bush, challenged
McCain's petitions in 16 of New York's 31 congressional districts, claiming he
failed to obtain the required number of signatures from party members.
</P>
<P>
	   Should all the challenges be upheld, McCain would find himself competing for
delegates in less than half the state.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 12th congressional district, which covers parts of Manhattan,
Brooklyn and Queens, local elections officials are giving McCain extra time to
prove that some of his petition signers actually are registered Republican
voters.
</P>
<P>
	   "If they can prove that they're Republicans, then we'll withdraw the
challenge," Buley said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has also sued to get on the New York primary ballot. McCain's lawsuit
will be heard in federal court at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush also faces some petition challenges from publisher Steve Forbes in six
New York City congressional districts. "We are highly, highly confident we will
prevail," Buley said.

<HEADLINE> Court Expands Review of ADA Suits  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today expanded its review of whether
state employees are protected by a key federal anti-discrimination law, the
Americans with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
	   In a brief order, the justices added an Arkansas dispute to a Florida case
granted review Friday. The two cases will be argued together in April, and a
decision is expected by July.
</P>
<P>
	   At issue is whether Congress exceeded its power by giving all state
employees the right to sue in federal court over the ADA. Depending on how
broadly the justices choose to rule on the law and states' 11th Amendment
immunity from being sued in federal courts, the court's ruling could determine
whether anyone can invoke the ADA to sue a state over alleged bias based on a
disability.
</P>
<P>
	   The law is best known for requiring equal access to public buildings.
</P>
<P>
	   In a Jan. 11 decision, the justices barred all state employees across the
nation from going into federal court to sue over age bias. The court, by a 5-4
vote, whittled away more of the federal government's power over states,
perpetuating a line of decisions legal scholars say amount to a states' rights
revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   In the case added to the court's decision docket today, Christopher Alsbrook
sued the Arkansas Commission on Law Enforcement Standards and Training, a state
regulatory agency, only to have the case thrown out on 11th Amendment grounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Alsbrook, a 1993 graduate of the agency's training academy, worked as a
policeman for the city of Maumelle, Ark., for three years before he was denied a
job with the Little Rock Police Department because he did not meet the state's
vision requirement.
</P>
<P>
	   The law enforcement commission then notified the Maumelle Police Department
that he was not certified for law enforcement duties. Maumelle officials
subsequently barred Alsbrook from doing any police-related duties.
</P>
<P>
	   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out Alsbrook's lawsuit, ruling
by a 6-4 vote that Congress was not authorized to allow ADA lawsuits against
state employers.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Florida case with which Alsbrook's case is paired, prison guard
Wellington Dickson sued in federal court after failing to get a promotion,
saying he was discriminated against because of his age and his heart condition.
His lawsuit invoked the two laws aimed at discrimination based on age and
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
	   An Atlanta-based federal appeals court said his claims under both laws could
proceed to trial, but the Supreme Court reversed that part of the decision
dealing with the age-bias law.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida authorities want the justices to also reverse the ADA portion of the
appeals court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration has told the court that the disabilities law is
``distinctly more detailed and nuanced'' than the age-bias law.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional findings and evidence compiled provide ``a solid foundation
for Congress' conclusion that state and local governments, like private
employers, engage in unconstitutional discrimination against persons with
disabilities and that the problem is sufficiently entrenched and widespread to
require a national response,'' Justice Department lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Alsbrook vs. Arkansas, 99-423.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 22.03; Nasdaq Up 3.15  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today, with selected blue-chip stocks
edging higher on the strength of corporate earnings while the broader market was
held lower by fears about rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was down
22.03 at 10,986.14.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were modestly higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 2.99 at 1,404.90, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 3.15 at
4,099.23.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks swung between positive and negative territory as investors once again
balanced strong corporate profits with the fear of higher interest rates, which
could eventually cut into company earnings.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow's technology companies pulled the average lower today, with IBM off
4 7/16 at 117 1/16 and Hewlett-Packard down 4 7/8 at 109 1/8.
</P>
<P>
	   But several other companies posted substantial gains.
</P>
<P>
	   Procter &AMP; Gamble rose 5 11/16 to 101 11/16. The company's stock price, which
tumbled last week as P&AMP;G held talks to acquire drug companies Warner-Lambert and
American Home Products, began its recovery yesterday after company officials
called off the talks. Today, P&AMP;G posted fiscal second-quarter earnings that beat
analysts' expectations, providing further punch to the stock.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney rose 4 9/16 to 37 1/16 a day after its earnings report topped
expectations. Disney shares also benefited from a management reorganization that
will elevate ABC network chief Robert Iger to second in command at Disney.
</P>
<P>
	   Trading was fairly volatile as investors contemplated next week's Federal
Reserve meeting. Central bankers are expected to raise interest rates a
quarter-percentage point, but many economists fear that increase next week will
be the first of several as the central bank works to hold off inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think people want to see how the market digests higher interest rates,"
said Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. in Kansas
City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, the Conference Board reported consumer confidence soared in January
to the highest level ever reached in the 32 years that the data has been
compiled. The report suggested consumer spending, the primary engine of the
nation's economic growth, will continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
	   The report may add to the Fed's concern that the economy is growing too
quickly, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 475.85 million shares, behind Monday's
pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.71 to 521.24.

<HEADLINE> Xerox profits fall 52 percent in fourth quarter  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - Xerox Corp. today said its profits fell 52
percent in the fourth quarter, as the company continued to struggle with
increased competitive pressure, the reorganization of its sales force and lower
sales caused by customer Y2K anxiety.
<P>
	   Xerox President Rick Thoman said the company would look for efficiencies and
cost-savings steps and may take a charge of "hundreds of millions of dollars" in
the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Virtually everything is on the table," Thoman said in a morning conference
call with industry analysts. "Some difficult choices must be made."
</P>
<P>
	   Net income in the fourth quarter was $294 million, or 41 cents per share,
compared with $615 million, or 84 cents per share, in the same period a year
ago. Revenues in the quarter fell 6 percent to $5.44 billion, compared with
$5.79 billion a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The company had warned last month that its fourth-quarter earnings would be
down, following an 11 percent decline in third-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
	   "We recognize our shareholders aren't satisfied. They shouldn't be," Thoman
said.
</P>
<P>
	   While the fourth quarter was "a major disappointment," Thoman said the
company has made progress on some key problems.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said its results were also affected by reduced revenue and
profits from Brazil and unfavorable currency exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, net income from continuing operations fell 16 percent to
$1.42 billion, or $1.96 per share, compared with $1.70 billion, or $2.33 per
share in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Including a 1998 restructuring charge of $1.10 billion and a discontinued
operations loss, Xerox reported 1998 net income of $395 million, or 52 cents per
share.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues for the full year fell 1 percent to $19.23 billion, compared with
$19.45 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Xerox warned again that the company will probably see a similar decline in
earnings in the first quarter and a smaller decline in the second quarter. The
company expects earnings growth later this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Thoman said the company has "turned the corner" on resolving its customer
administration issues in the United States and has completed its sales force
realignment. He also said the company would announce new products this year to
enhance its position in the digital office.
</P>
<P>
	   Xerox spokeswoman Christa Carone would not comment on whether there will be
more job cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   "We can't give any detail at all other than to say that ... we're looking at
all of our operations, with the exception of our sales force and our research
and development operations," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, the company streamlined its U.S. customer administration by
consolidating 36 billing centers across the country into three. It also
reorganized its 14,000-person sales force toward coverage of specific industries
and away from geographical coverage. Both moves caused disruption and slowed
productivity, the company said.

<HEADLINE> Congress weighs in on Cuban boy's case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - As support grew for legislation to grant U.S.
citizenship to Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old boy's grandmothers met with
lawmakers today to press for his return to Cuba. President Clinton left open the
possibility of a veto of any citizenship bill.
<P>
	   "I have not decided what to do and I would not rule that out," Clinton said
today. "I have not decided what to do."
</P>
<P>
	   The president urged Congress to delay action until the issue had played out
in court, and he urged lawmakers and others involved to think first about "what
is right for the child."
</P>
<P>
	   "No one can really know for sure, I suppose, what terrible and probably not
fully conscious burdens that child has already sustained because he lost his
mother," Clinton said, adding that the competition over young Elian also was
likely affecting him.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers' first stop today was at the offices of Rep. Sheila Jackson
Lee, D-Texas, who said she hoped the House would not take up legislation
granting citizenship or permanent residency to Elian. "What we are doing is
politicizing it by taking away the federal jurisdiction," Jackson Lee said.
</P>
<P>
	   The meeting had been delayed by a January snowstorm that shut down much of
the capital.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the first time they've seen snow," said the Rev. Joan Brown Campbell
of the National Council of Churches, which sponsored the grandmothers' trip.
"They wanted to know if they could go out and touch it."
</P>
<P>
	   Campbell said the women feared that if the legislation in Congress passed
"that they may not see him in his young years back in Cuba."
</P>
<P>
	   Versions of the citizenship bill were introduced Monday in both the House
and the Senate, and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told his
colleagues they might debate the measure as early as Wednesday. A vote Wednesday
is possible, but both sides said they doubt final action will occur until next
week at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
	   In the House, rival but unbinding legislation was introduced urging that
Elian be repatriated with his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is time to put an end to his ordeal by reuniting him with his family and
his grandparents in Cuba," said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., senior Democrat on
the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders of both parties struggled to find a consensus, which did not exist
Monday, as lawmakers returned to work from their long winter break.
</P>
<P>
	   Both parties scheduled meetings today to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides to Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., a sponsor of legislation to end the
40-year-old trade embargo with Cuba, said Elian's grandmothers, visiting from
Cuba, planned to meet with Dodd this afternoon. They also were meeting with Rep.
Joseph Moakley, D-Mass., who believes the boy should be returned to his father,
Moakley's office said.
</P>
<P>
	   The two women flew here on Monday night by private jet after their attempt
to visit the boy in Miami failed. The boy's maternal grandmother, Raquel
Rodriguez, and paternal grandmother, Mariela Quintana, shunned an invitation to
have dinner Monday night at the home of Elian's relatives in Miami, who insisted
the meeting take place there. The grandmothers wanted to meet privately with
Elian at a neutral site.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of Elian's Miami relatives were planning to travel to Washington as
well.
</P>
<P>
	   Lott and a group of Florida lawmakers put in motion the process to bestow
citizenship on the boy, who has been cared for by the Miami relatives since he
was found clinging to an inner tube off the Florida coast on Nov. 25. His mother
and 10 other Cubans died in their ill-fated attempt to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Sponsors hoped to whisk the citizenship bill through Congress quickly,
largely to remove the case from jurisdiction of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, which has ruled that the boy should be returned to his
father on the island. Passage of the citizenship legislation also would render
moot a federal court appeal of the INS ruling by Elian's great-uncle in Miami,
sponsors said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This moves the decision-making out of the hands of the INS and into the
hands of the (state) courts," said Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., the measure's chief
Senate sponsor.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the Senate Judiciary Committee's top
Democrat, denounced the bill.
</P>
<P>
	   "For the Congress to grant citizenship to a young boy over the father's
objection makes a mockery of family values and it hands Castro yet another
reason to portray the United States as the enemy," Leahy said. Cuban President
Fidel Castro's government has sponsored a series of mass demonstrations
demanding the boy's repatriation.
</P>
<P>
	   Bestowing American citizenship is a power Congress uses rarely.
</P>
<P>
	   It gave citizenship to Winston Churchill and Mother Teresa and posthumously
to Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat who saved tens of thousands of Hungarian
Jews in World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   But congressional involvement in individual immigration cases has declined
sharply in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
	   Some high-profile examples:
</P>
<P>
	   -In July 1997, Swiss bank guard Christoph Meili won permanent residency
status. He had lost his job after saving Holocaust-era bank documents from a
shredder.
</P>
<P>
	   -In 1968, three men - from Italy, Ireland and Germany - who died while
fighting with American units in Vietnam, posthumously received U.S. citizenship.
</P>
<P>
	   -In 1988, Michael Wilding, the son of actress Elizabeth Taylor and a former
stepson of Sen. John Warner, R-Va., won citizenship. The British subject had
renounced his U.S. citizenship in 1971, and the bill blocked a possible
deportation on a marijuana-possession conviction.

<HEADLINE> PBS Explores the Trouble Art Stirs  </HEADLINE>
    By FRAZIER MOORE AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- They'll be watching in Enid, Okla.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month, members of the Enid school board put off deciding the
fate of a certain literary classic until they could view "Born to Trouble:
'Adventures of Huckleberry Finn."'
</P>
<P>
	   Produced by WGBH/Boston and airing on PBS Wednesday at 9 p.m. EST, this
90-minute documentary is part of "Culture Shock," a splendid four-segment series
exploring how art -- be it a novel or a painting, music or the movies --
habitually makes trouble.
</P>
<P>
	   Art invites troublesome questions, such as: Does "Huckleberry Finn" promote
racism?
</P>
<P>
	   And here's another: Does the "wrong" kind of painting corrupt its audience?
Following "Born to Trouble" at 10:30 p.m., "The Shock of the Nude" revisits the
scandal of "Olympia," Edouard Manet's portrait of a harsh-looking tootsy
reclining in the raw.
</P>
<P>
	   In time it was embraced as a masterpiece. But in 1865, this painting
virtually mooned the artistic tradition of dreamy, demure nakedness. With its
brazen realism, "Olympia" outraged all who beheld it.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, Feb. 2, at 9 p.m., "Hollywood Censored" explores the
long-standing effort to rein in movie mischief.
</P>
<P>
	   As early as 1915, the documentary tells us, dozens of state and local
governments had established movie censorship boards, which was easy since the
U.S. Supreme Court then excluded movies from First Amendment protection.
</P>
<P>
	   But in the 1930s, Hollywood responded to threats of federal censorship with
a self-imposed Production Code. Among its many provisions: childbirth and the
use of illegal drugs could not be depicted; no brutal killings could be shown in
detail; and dozens of words (including "slut" and "eunuch") were taboo.
</P>
<P>
	   We see Joe Breen, hired to police the code, grandly put the world on notice:
"Cockeyed philosophies of life, ugly sex situations, cheap jokes and dirty
dialogue are not wanted."
</P>
<P>
	   Then at 10 p.m., "The Devil's Music" takes us back to the 1920s for the
crusade against jazz -- newfangled music widely condemned for triggering
race-mixing, animal lust and social chaos. (Carmaker Henry Ford's comprehensive
remedy: Everybody folk-dance!)
</P>
<P>
	   While each of the "Culture Shock" films is built around an artistic
"outrage" from the past, the series deftly draws connections between then and
now.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, "The Devil's Music" jumps from the '20s to the 1990s and the
current uproar over gangsta rap. In today's world, a grim William Bennett
unwittingly reprises yesterday's warnings about jazz: "I think that nothing less
is at stake than the preservation of civilization."
</P>
<P>
	   Why does art get us so darn riled?
</P>
<P>
	   With "Huckleberry Finn," author Mark Twain aimed to expose racism as an
atrocity -- not endorse it. Yet, more than a century later, this "buddy novel"
about a father-seeking white boy and a freedom-seeking black slave is the most
widely banned book in the nation for its depiction of blacks and heavy use of
racist language.
</P>
<P>
	   A black woman who filed suit in Tempe, Ariz., to have it removed from the
high school's required-reading list speaks repeatedly of the "pain" the book's
language causes her daughter.
</P>
<P>
	   A literary scholar who also happens to be black responds that learning can't
always be painless.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the word 'nigger' did not have meaning today," adds writer David
Bradley, "we wouldn't care that it was in 'Huckleberry Finn.' ... The hurt is,
that what happens on the playground is reflected in the book, not the other way
around."
</P>
<P>
	   But this is only the latest chapter in a turbulent history. The film
chronicles how "Huckleberry Finn" has been a literary bad boy since readers
first encountered it in 1885.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, the Concord, Mass., public library banned the book a month after its
publication, calling it "trash." The reason back then? Huck, this godless
ragamuffin who spoke in vulgar English, was considered a poor role model.
</P>
<P>
	   Not so long ago, the same thing was said about Bart Simpson.
</P>
<P>
	   Such parallels abound. In the v-chip era -- nearly a century after
"indecent" movies were first vilified -- the effects of media sex and violence
are still debated.
</P>
<P>
	   And 134 years after guards were hired to protect "Olympia" for its Paris
showing, a fed-up visitor to the Brooklyn Museum of Art tried to destroy a
painting of the Virgin Mary that, besides customary materials, was notoriously
rendered with elephant dung.
</P>
<P>
	   There's no mistaking the message of "Culture Shock": Art rages on, just as
it always has, angering its public at the liberties it takes.
</P>
<P>
	   Does that make art dangerous? Referring to "Huckleberry Finn," Bradley
concedes that a book can be the spark that sets off a powder keg. But then he
cautions: Don't mistake the art for the powder keg.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Eyes Debt Payment by 2013  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today he will propose a budget
plan next month to pay off the government's $3.6 trillion publicly held debt by
2013, two years sooner than expected. He urged Republican leaders: ``Put
politics aside and join me.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meantime, the Congressional Budget Office has upped the stakes in this
year's budget battle by projecting a huge surplus of up to $1.9 trillion over
the next decade, according to a congressional aide speaking on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, citing a combination of the prosperous economy and his fiscal
policies, said the debt is $1.7 trillion lower than it was projected to be when
he took office seven years ago. He said his proposal would devote interest
savings to Social Security, extending its solvency beyond 2050, and his plan
also would seek to ensure Medicare's survival until at least 2025.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now is not the time to let up on a strategy that is plainly working,'' he
said. ``Our children and their children will not inherit the crippling burden of
interests payments that we faced seven years ago.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said his plan would mean the United States would become debt-free
for the first time since 1835, when there were only 24 states and 15 million
citizens. He said it is important that political leaders in both parties commit
to using the budget surpluses to pay down the debt.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we're doing by taking this position is maximizing the choices the
next president and the next Congress will have,'' Clinton said. ``I ask the
Republican majority in Congress to put politics aside and join me.''
</P>
<P>
	   The administration's claim of making the government debt-free covers only
the two-thirds of the $5.7 trillion national debt that is held by the public in
the form of Treasury bonds and bills.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton program does not deal with the other $2 trillion of government
debt which is held by the government's trust funds, primarily Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   CBO's new surplus projections -- which exclude Social Security -- are nearly
twice the $1 trillion estimate that CBO made just last July. They mean that
there will be that much more on the table for Clinton and Congress to consider
as they battle over using the money for tax cuts, higher spending or reducing
the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   It will also affect the debate on the presidential campaign trail, where
contenders' proposals have included calls for tax cuts, expanding federal health
care aid and reducing the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional Republicans also are talking more about using the massive
revenues coming into the Treasury to eliminate the publicly held federal debt
rather than try again for a massive tax cut similar to the one vetoed by Clinton
last year.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked whether he believes there should be a tax cut this year, Clinton
said tax cuts are possible if they are modest, targeted and within the confines
of fiscal discipline.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But I do not believe we should have very big tax cuts that will explode in
the second five years of a 10-year period and ignore what the real needs of the
country will be,'' Clinton said. ``Those things are easy to do, but they are
difficult to undo if times get tough.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's debt proposal comes amid an election-year battle between Democrats
and Republicans over how much black ink there will be. That battle was touched
off by an unusual decision by Congress' top budget analyst to produce three
separate surplus estimates.
</P>
<P>
	   Dan Crippen, director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, is
expected to release three surplus projections for the coming decade on
Wednesday. The figure Congress ultimately chooses will determine how much money
is available for tax cuts, spending increases and debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats are expected to embrace the smallest of three projections. That
total, for the 10 years ending 2010, will be roughly $1 trillion excluding
Social Security, say congressional aides speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans have not decided what to do, but many of them -- including the
Senate Budget Committee chairman, Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M. -- seem likely to
endorse a projection totaling about $2 trillion over the period, aides said.
That is about double what CBO projected last year, a figure that has grown
because of the persistently strong economy.
</P>
<P>
	   CBO will also release a third projection which, though arrived at
differently, also foresees about $2 trillion in black ink, aides said.
</P>
<P>
	   It is unusual for CBO to produce multiple surplus estimates without
endorsing one as the figure it believes most valid. CBO's decision to release
three projections highlights the immense political pressure on the agency as the
two parties vie over rival visions of how to use the government's projected
extra cash.
</P>
<P>
	   The figure Democrats like assumes that the one-third of the $1.7 trillion
federal budget that Congress must approve every year will grow annually at the
rate of inflation. That one-third of the budget covers everything but
automatically paid benefits like Social Security and interest on the federal
debt.
</P>
<P>
	   That option assumes the most spending -- with less money left over for the
GOP's proposed tax cuts -- than any of CBO's alternatives. It also most nearly
approaches what has actually happened in recent years, as lawmakers have
consistently increased spending for defense and many domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The number many Republicans like assumes that the money spent on that
one-third of the budget will remain frozen at roughly $620 billion, about what
is being spent this year. It assumes less spending than Democrats would like,
with more money left over for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   The third option assumes that spending limits on this portion of the budget
will be obeyed even though these limits have been surpassed for the past two
years.

<HEADLINE> Poll shows Gore closing gap with Bradley  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) - A new poll has Al Gore and Bill Bradley tied among
voters in New Hampshire's Democratic primary, while John McCain maintains his
lead over George W. Bush on the Republican side.
<P>
	   The Quinnipiac College poll, released Tuesday, shows Gore closing a 10-point
gap over the past two weeks to tie Bradley at 44 percent each. The previous
Quinnipiac College poll, released Jan. 13, gave Bradley an edge over Gore, 47
percent to 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's favorability rating also improved in the latest poll, from 45 percent
to 54 percent. Bradley's remained virtually unchanged at 56 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Several other recent New Hampshire polls also show Gore running even with
Bradley, or ahead. The vice president and the former New Jersey senator have
been trading places in the polls since late fall.
</P>
<P>
	   With one week to go until the Feb. 1 primaries, the nation's earliest,
McCain held an 11-point lead over Bush, 39 percent to 28 percent. Other recent
polls show McCain, an Arizona senator, with an edge over the Texas governor or
running even in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's do or die for Senator McCain in New Hampshire, and it looks as if he
will do," said pollster Maurice Carroll. "If only Republicans voted in their
party's primary, Bush and McCain would be neck and neck, but the independent
voters love McCain."
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey publisher Steve Forbes trailed with 9 percent, conservative
activist Gary Bauer polled 7 percent, former ambassador Alan Keyes had 4 percent
and Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch had zero. The numbers remained basically unchanged
since the last poll.
</P>
<P>
	   Hatch, who came in last in the Iowa GOP caucuses Monday with only 1 percent
of the vote, planned to drop out of the race before the New Hampshire primary, a
senior aide said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll also found that one out of five New Hampshire voters have met at
least one of the candidates. Sixty-five percent have watched at least one of the
Republican debates and 55 percent have watched one of the Gore-Bradley debates.
</P>
<P>
	   "Give those New Hampshire voters credit," Carroll said. "Two-thirds of them
have watched a GOP debate and more than half of them have watched a Democratic
face-off."
</P>
<P>
	   The survey, conducted last Tuesday through Sunday, included 498 registered
Republicans and independents who plan to vote in the Republican primary, and 371
likely voters in the Democratic primary. The margin of error on the GOP side was
4.5 percentage points; it was 5 points for Democratic results.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Sees Colombia Aid Support  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Acknowledging the threat guerrilla groups and drug
traffickers pose to the Colombian government, President Clinton today predicted
bipartisan congressional support for his $1.6 billion aid package for Bogota.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's always a risk when you go out on a limb to try to save a neighbor
and help people to help themselves, that it won't work,'' Clinton said hours
before a scheduled meeting with Colombian President Andres Pastrana in the Oval
Office. ``I believe the risk in the investment is something that we ought to
do.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said Colombia's democracy is ``under the greatest stress perhaps in
its history,'' and held out the struggle in that large South American nation as
an example regimes across the globe will face in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you look at Colombia, that's in sort of the intersection of
narco-traffickers and the political rebels,'' he said, ``you see a picture of
what you might see much more of in the 21st century world ... enemies of
nation-states forming networks of support across national borders and across
otherwise discrete interests, like narco-traffickers, organized criminals and
political terrorists, weapons dealers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One of the things that we have to do is to try to help them gain some
measure of control over their own country again,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's two-year, $1.6 billion aid package will provide training for
special counternarcotics battalions and 30 Black Hawk and 33 Huey helicopters
for counterdrug activities. Funds also will be used for radar, aircraft and
airfield upgrades, and improved intelligence gathering.
</P>
<P>
	   Several Latin American analysts have questioned whether the assistance would
worsen Colombia's civil war, in which leftist guerrillas have been sparring with
government soldiers for decades.
</P>
<P>
	   But the plan appears to have substantial congressional support, especially
among Republican lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm going to work to build a bipartisan consensus on this, to take this
out of politics, because I believe that this is not only something we should do
for our friend and neighbor in a country that is either the production or
transit point for about 80 percent of the cocaine that gets dumped in this
country, but also, if you will, a test run for the kind of challenges that my
successors and our people will face in the years ahead,'' Clinton said.

<P>
	   CBO's bigger surplus projections are largely due to the economy's continuing
strong performance, which has poured unanticipated revenue into federal coffers.
The latest figures cover the fiscal years 2001 through 2010.
</P>
<P>
	   In good news for Republicans, CBO -- Congress' nonpartisan budget analyst --
is also projecting a $22 billion surplus this year without using Social Security
funds, said another aide also speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   GOP lawmakers promised not to spend Social Security funds when they
completed this year's spending bills last November, part of their effort to
assert that they want to protect the popular pension program. Though the final
figures won't be known until fiscal 2000 ends Oct. 1, the CBO figures showed
that for now, it looks like Republicans succeeded in not touching Social
Security money.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've stopped the raid on Social Security,'' said Emily Miller,
spokeswoman for House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Reflecting the enormous political pressure on CBO, the budget agency took
the unusual step of making three separate projections of the surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   One, likely to be embraced by Republicans, assumes that this year's
expenditure of nearly $620 billion will be unchanged for the decade and produces
a $1.9 trillion surplus. It assumes less spending than Democrats would like,
with more money left over for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   A second CBO projection assumes that spending every year will keep even with
inflation, and yields an $800 billion 10-year surplus estimate, an aide said.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats prefer this estimate, which assumes that more spending will occur
than the two other projections assume. It also most nearly approaches what has
actually happened in recent years, as lawmakers have consistently increased
spending for defense and many domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
	   A third assumes that spending limits on one-third of the $1.7 trillion
federal budget will be obeyed, and also produces a $1.9 trillion surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   Those limits have been ignored by tens of billions of dollars for two years,
and are virtually certain to be ignored again this year. Both parties have come
to view the spending limits as politically unrealistic, especially in an
election year.

<HEADLINE> Court Expands Review of ADA Suits  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court expanded its study of whether state
employees are protected by a key federal anti-discrimination law, the Americans
with Disabilities Act, by adding an Arkansas dispute to its decision docket
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In a brief order, the justices said they will hear arguments in the Arkansas
case in April along with one from Florida. The court is expected to decide both
cases by July.
</P>
<P>
	   At issue in both is whether Congress exceeded its power by giving all state
employees the right to sue in federal court over the ADA, a law best known for
requiring equal access to public buildings.
</P>
<P>
	   Depending on how broadly the justices choose to rule on the law and states'
11th Amendment immunity from being sued in federal courts, their ruling could
determine whether anyone can invoke the ADA and sue a state for alleged
discrimination based on a disability.
</P>
<P>
	   In a Jan. 11 decision, the justices barred all state employees from going
into federal court to sue over age bias. That 5-4 ruling whittled away the
federal government's power over states, perpetuating a line of decisions legal
scholars say amount to a states' rights revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Arkansas case, Christopher Alsbrook sued the Arkansas Commission on
Law Enforcement Standards and Training, a state regulatory agency, only to have
the case thrown out on 11th Amendment grounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Alsbrook, a 1993 graduate of the agency's training academy, worked as a
policeman for the city of Maumelle, Ark., for three years before he was denied a
job with the Little Rock Police Department because he did not meet the state's
vision requirement.
</P>
<P>
	   The law enforcement commission then notified the Maumelle Police Department
that he was not certified for law enforcement duties. Maumelle officials
subsequently barred Alsbrook from doing any police-related duties.
</P>
<P>
	   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out Alsbrook's lawsuit, ruling
by a 6-4 vote that Congress was not authorized to allow ADA lawsuits against
state employers.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Florida case with which Alsbrook's case is paired, prison guard
Wellington Dickson sued in federal court after failing to get a promotion,
saying he was discriminated against because, among other things, he has a heart
condition. His lawsuit was allowed by lower courts, and state officials are
appealing.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration has told the court the disabilities law is
``distinctly more detailed and nuanced'' than the age-bias law.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional findings and evidence compiled provide ``a solid foundation
for Congress' conclusion that state and local governments, like private
employers, engage in unconstitutional discrimination against persons with
disabilities and that the problem is sufficiently entrenched and widespread to
require a national response,'' Justice Department lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
	   In ruling that state employees cannot sue in federal court over age bias,
the court said Congress does not enjoy the same power to enforce the 14th
Amendment when seeking to protect older people as it does when the bias is based
on race or gender.
</P>
<P>
	   Laws and governmental policies that treat older people differently are
upheld as constitutional if courts find they are ``rationally related'' to some
legitimate objective, not a difficult standard to meet. But laws and policies
that treat someone differently because of race or gender are subjected to more
stringent review by courts.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices have never said that discrimination based on someone's
disabilities should be subjected to judicial scrutiny more stringent than the
rationality standard.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton raises gender issue in explaining criticism  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton said Tuesday some people may
dislike her because she is a woman in public life, or it could be her hairdo.
<P>
	   During a morning interview with Albany's WGY-AM radio, the expected Senate
candidate was told that "in certain circles, just mention your name and you've
got foaming at the mouth."
</P>
<P>
	   After momentary laughter from Mrs. Clinton, WGY's morning show host, Don
Weeks, asked if she "ever tried to understand that venom and does it bother
you?"
</P>
<P>
	   "I know that it's out there and I think some of it is because of the
positions that I've taken and maybe a little of it is because I'm a woman taking
those positions," the first lady said. "And, maybe some of it is people don't
like my hair style. I don't know what it is."
</P>
<P>
	   Some recent polls have shown Mrs. Clinton running almost even with her
expected Senate rival, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, among female
voters. The mayor is leading among white women voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Given that, independent pollster Lee Miringoff said it is little wonder that
Mrs. Clinton would try to appeal to women voters by portraying herself as a
victim of gender discrimination.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's been an eroding of the gender gap," the head of Marist College's
Institute for Public Opinion said. "Clearly, she needs to win and win big among
women to be successful."
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate comment from the Giuliani camp.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think gender has anything to do with it," said GOP Gov. George
Pataki, a Giuliani supporter. "When you don't live in a state, I don't care what
your gender is, it's a legitimate issue. When you have certain philosophical
positions that are, I believe, out of touch with the vast majority of New
Yorkers, that's a legitimate concern."
</P>
<P>
	   During her morning radio interview, Mrs. Clinton said she has received a
"very warm welcome" from her new neighbors in suburban Westchester County, but
that she has "taken every chance I could to apologize to my neighbors because
there are satellite trucks and errant press people tromping through their
backyards with their telephoto lenses.
</P>
<P>
	   "Don't tell anybody this, but I don't have any curtains yet so, gosh, I
don't know what they might be seeing," she added.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton also stole a phrase out of her husband's dog-eared campaign
play book as she discussed her adopted state's high energy costs, stiff property
taxes and hefty in-state airfares.
</P>
<P>
	   "Now that I'm a resident, I can share your pain," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Later Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton was to speak to a group of school
superintendents from across the state. She hopes to make education a major
campaign issue against the mayor.

<HEADLINE> Like it or not, the corset is here to stay  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A straight-laced woman is never loose. Or is she?
<P>
	   From Catherine de Medici to Madonna, women have cinched their bodies into
corsets of every imaginable description. Now the contraptions are on view at the
Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Corset: Fashioning the Body" spans 400 years of women - and a few men -
wearing corsets.
</P>
<P>
	   Men? Yup.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 19th century, both dandies and older men wore corsets, minus the
hourglass shape.
</P>
<P>
	   Apollo, an 1880-1890 corset made of metal and lace, was a favorite among
cavalry officers. And while most men wore corsets for medical reasons, there was
also the occasional cross-dresser.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, corsets are symbols of femininity, and the point of most is to mold a
woman's body into an hourglass shape.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 16th century, there was the rare all-metal corset, with its 14-inch
waist constructed from six horizontal strips of steel. Some historians think it
was an orthopedic device designed to correct spinal deformities.
</P>
<P>
	   As the centuries marched on, the corset evolved for ... um ... comfort.
</P>
<P>
	   The 19th century's Pretty Housemaid corset was mass produced and was
advertised as the strongest and cheapest corset ever made. Unlike many of its
predecessors, it was not made of whalebone, because the material was too
expensive. The elegant red bodice with white lace trim looks more wearable than
what appeared 100 years later.
</P>
<P>
	   But there's still a 1997 edition by Dean Sonnenberg and Anthony Pacesa, who
created a double-corseted dress with a 16-inch waist. (Not even Scarlett O'Hara
could swing that.)
</P>
<P>
	   The metallic leather and silk moirDe dress with a built-in internal corset
is owned by Catherine Jung, who is a tight-lacer. The outer layer silver-over
corset looks like a metal shield but is purely decorative and cannot be
adjusted.
</P>
<P>
	   The dress looks medieval.
</P>
<P>
	   "What hell our women have to go through tied and bound," to quote Montaigne.
</P>
<P>
	   So whose idea were these things?
</P>
<P>
	   "Women wore corsets for almost 400 years, because comfort was judged less
important than social status, feminine beauty and respectability," museum
curator Valerie Steele said Monday. "The corset was a status symbol, because it
constrained the wearer's physical mobility, thus supposedly demonstrating that
she could afford servants."
</P>
<P>
	   Today, it's not about servants; it's about the popular gym-sculpted look.
And when diets and exercise fail, or liposuction seems over the top, there's
still the corset.
</P>
<P>
	   The modern version, made this year by Malaysian designer Yeohlee, uses Lycra
strips rather than whalebone to hold its shape.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're going forward," Yeohlee said. "Clothes are more shaped and
comfortable."
</P>
<P>
	   Let's hope so.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 18th and 19th centuries, tight corsets caused shortness of breath and
fainting because they restricted the chest and reduced lung capacity. In some
cases, they even permanently altered body shape.
</P>
<P>
	   They've come a long way, baby.

<HEADLINE> East Hartford says stadium could cause traffic problems  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   EAST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - City officials want the state to pay for up
to $50 million in road improvements to avoid potential traffic headaches should
the proposed University of Connecticut football stadium be located in East
Hartford.
<P>
	   Mayor Timothy D. Larson and members of the East Hartford Town Council have
told state planners they envision ramps from Interstate 84 and Route 2 sending
vehicles directly into the stadium site, as well as an access road connecting
one entrance to the other.
</P>
<P>
	   But the state Department of Transportation has issued an opinion that
existing highways and roads could handle the traffic generated by the
35,000-seat stadium. A formal traffic study should be completed within two
weeks, said Benson Cohn, executive finance officer with the state's Office of
Policy and Management.
</P>
<P>
	   Legislative leaders say they have serious concerns about anything that could
increase the cost of the stadium, which is currently estimated at about $90
million. Even some members of the East Hartford delegation doubt whether they
can convince their colleagues of the need for improved roads.
</P>
<P>
	   "What we want and what is possible are two different things," said Sen. Gary
D. LeBeau, D-East Hartford. Referring to the road improvements, LeBeau said, "It
would just make the whole project impractical. It will put the stadium too far
out of reach."
</P>
<P>
	   But without the improvements, some East Hartford officials said they would
consider revoking their support for the stadium. They said the improvements,
first proposed when the owners of Six Flags amusement parks briefly considered
buying the land, are necessary to avoid game-day gridlock and backups on the
highways and in residential neighborhoods surrounding the nearby Pratt &AMP; Whitney
Aircraft factory.
</P>
<P>
	   They also want to ensure further development of Rentschler Field.
</P>
<P>
	   Relying on the existing roads "is very shortsighted," Larson said. "That is
not an option."
</P>
<P>
	   Town Council Chairman Richard F. Kehoe said: "If they refuse to do the
improvements, then we certainly cannot guarantee that the stadium would be built
in timely fashion. This is not a stadium that we asked for. That is something we
will continue to stress."
</P>
<P>
	   Dean Pagani, the governor's press secretary, said the initial findings of
the transportation department show that the stadium would not require anywhere
near the same level of road improvements that were planned for the Six Flags
amusement park.
</P>
<P>
	   Pressure is on the state to move the UConn football program into a stadium
with at least 30,000 seats by 2003, a requirement for jumping to Division I-A in
the Big East from Division I-AA in the Atlantic 10 Conference.

<HEADLINE> Judge to allow television coverage of Diallo trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - New York's law banning cameras from its courtrooms
is unconstitutional, opening the way for television coverage of the upcoming
trial of four New York City police officers accused of murdering an unarmed
immigrant, a judge ruled today.
<P>
	   "The quest for justice in any case must be accomplished under the eyes of
the public," Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi said.
</P>
<P>
	   However, only Court TV will be allowed to bring its camera into the
courtroom and the network can pool the video to other networks, he ruled.
</P>
<P>
	   "The denial of access to the vast majority will accomplish nothing but more
divisiveness while the broadcast of the trial will further the interests of
justice, enhance public understanding of the judicial system and maintain a high
level of public confidence in the judiciary," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Teresi said there is a presumptive First Amendment right of the media to
televise court proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   "As a presumptive right exists the per se ban is a barrier to the exercise
of basic constitutional rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jury selection begins Monday. Teresi said Court TV's camera will be allowed
in the courtroom starting with opening arguments.
</P>
<P>
	   Teresi said his ruling should apply not only to the Diallo trial, but to all
other trials in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   A grand jury indicted the plain clothes officers in March 1999 after they
fired 41 bullets at Diallo, an unarmed street vendor from West Africa, while
searching a Bronx neighborhood for a rape suspect on Feb. 4, 1999. Diallo was
hit by 19 bullets.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for the officers - Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and
Richard Murphy - have said their clients mistakenly believed the victim was
reaching for a gun. The four officers were charged with second-degree murder.
All pleaded innocent.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting touched off weeks of angry protests leading to more than 1,100
arrests.
</P>
<P>
	   A state appeals court moved the officers' trial to Albany, agreeing with
defense lawyers' contentions that a fair and impartial jury could not be
assembled in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
	   Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson had taken no position on the
constitutional aspect of keeping cameras in the courtroom. However, in concept,
he does support having cameras in the courtroom, Johnson spokesman Steven Reed
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Reed said Johnson hadn't seen the ruling and had no further comment on it
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer will not appeal Teresi's ruling, his
spokesman Marc Violette said. Spitzer believes that defense lawyers will argue
"vigorously" against allowing television coverage of the Diallo trial, and that
media lawyers and others will argue for the presence of the camera in the
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is not uncommon for the attorney general not to be allowed in a
challenge of the constitutionality of state laws," Violette said.
</P>
<P>
	   However, McMellon's lawyer, Stephen Worth, told New York City cable new
station New York 1 that the defense had no immediate plans to appeal. The
defense had asked the judge to follow the existing law, which would have banned
cameras from the trial.
</P>
<P>
	   But "we respect his ruling and this will probably be a good thing for
everyone," Worth said. "I think this will stop this issue that in any way things
are being hidden and that once the public sees all the evidence they're going to
understand why these officers did what they did."
</P>
<P>
	   David Bookstaver, a spokesman for the state court system, said they were
still evaluating Judge Teresi's decision.
</P>
<P>
	   It has been almost three years since trials and criminal court hearings were
televised in New York. Audio and video recording was first allowed into New
York's trial courts in 1987, but only on an experimental basis. The law was
extended a few years at a time. The last extender expired in June 1997 and state
lawmakers have, thus far, refused to renew the law allowing television and audio
recording equipment back into the state's trial courts.

<HEADLINE> Intense swirling snowstorm pummels metropolitan area  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Swirling snow from an intense winter storm today closed
hundreds of schools and LaGuardia Airport, turned roads to slippery seas of
slush and made the commute for metropolitan residents a nightmare.
<P>
	   And that was the good news.
</P>
<P>
	   New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani warned that getting home would be even
tougher.
</P>
<P>
	   For John Keating, an iron worker from Orange County who sat on a bus for
more than 2 hours getting into the city, that came sooner than he expected. He
got to his construction job at the Queensborough Bridge only to find out, "They
shut the job down. I've come in. I'll turn around and I'll go home."
</P>
<P>
	   Snowfall in Central Park measured 4.5 inches by mid-morning, as white fluff
began turning into a mixture of light sleet and rain.
</P>
<P>
	   Periodic flurries were predicted through Wednesday. The northern suburbs
were expected to be hardest hit with 6 to 9 inches of snow.
</P>
<P>
	   Snowplows hit the roads shortly after the first flakes began to stick to the
ground around 5:30 a.m. The city expected to use 5,000 tons of salt on streets
and highways.
</P>
<P>
	   Weather officials predicted the storm would hit the metropolitan area
midweek but it developed more quickly than expected.
</P>
<P>
	   "We knew it was coming. It just decided to hit us a day earlier," said
National Weather Service meteorologist Tim Morrin. "It's an intense winter
storm, about as intense as we thought it could be and it's hitting us with its
full potential."
</P>
<P>
	   LaGuardia was closed at 7 a.m., but one of its two runways reopened at 1:30
p.m. Although Kennedy and Newark remained open, most morning flights out of
those airports were canceled by the airlines, said Port Authority of New York
and New Jersey spokesman Bill Cahill.
</P>
<P>
	   Cahill predicted there would be many delays and cancellations throughout the
day.
</P>
<P>
	   But Joao Nemeth, visiting from Brazil, already knew that. Nemeth, along with
his wife, two daughters, grandmother and grandfather, showed up at LaGuardia for
a 7:40 a.m. flight to Orlando, Fla., only to find the airport closed.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we didn't pick the best day for flying," he said, as he tried to
comfort his disappointed 11-year-old who was eager to get to Disney World.
</P>
<P>
	   Although inconvenienced, the Nemeth family experienced something new - their
first snowstorm. "They are enjoying it very well," he said. "It's something very
different. It's beautiful, really."
</P>
<P>
	   There was agreement from Janie Barnett, sipping coffee at a Brooklyn deli
after a hectic morning that included coercing her crying daughter - who wanted
to stay home and play in the snow - to go to school.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the whole world would just cancel life on a day like this, it would be
fine," said Barnett. "It's only the stress of trying to maintain your normal
life on a day like this that makes everybody crazy. Otherwise, we'd all be
happy, because it's glorious."
</P>
<P>
	   At the Thruway Diner in suburban New Rochelle, Jon Landers took a momentary
reprieve, sipping both a cup of coffee and a cup of hot chocolate. "Two-fisted
drinker," he said, explaining, "It's cold out there."
</P>
<P>
	   While morning commuters crawled their way to work on snow-clogged highways
and in overcrowded buses and subways, many were already looking to make an early
escape.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm sorry I came in," said Susan LaRaus, who spent two hours getting into
Port Authority from New Brunswick, N.J. "I'm leaving early, absolutely."
</P>
<P>
	   New York City's 1,100 public schools remained open but attendance was
lighter than usual, said Board of Education spokeswoman Margie Feinberg.
</P>
<P>
	   After-school and evening programs in the public schools were cancelled and
hundreds of private and Catholic schools in the city - and suburban public
schools - were closed as well.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor urged employers to stagger closing times today, so the subways,
buses and commuter lines can handle an extra, early passenger load.
</P>
<P>
	   While some could do without the snowy wonderland, Rudolph Williams surveyed
the slushy street from his doorman's perch at an Upper West Side building and
declared, "We need more snow. It adds beauty to this place. It adds life. It's
creative. ... This here is a winter's work of art!"

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 109.21; Nasdaq Down38.99  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned mostly lower today as investors' worries
about higher interest rates outweighed another round of strong corporate profit
reports.
</P>
<P>
	   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was
down 109.21 at 10,898.96.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators had also turned lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 8.55 at 1,393.36, and the Nasdaq composite index was down 38.99
at 4,057.09.
</P>
<P>
	   After posting some modest gains in morning trading, stocks collapsed as
investors fell prey to worries about rising interest rates, which could
eventually cut into corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
	   Next week, the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates a

<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned mostly lower today as investors' worries
about higher interest rates outweighed another round of strong corporate profit

<HEADLINE> Yale study ponders psychology of bad hair days  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - Bad hair days affect not just what's on your
head, but what's in it.
<P>
	   A Yale University study of the psychology of bad hair days found that
people's self-esteem goes awry when their hair is out of place.
</P>
<P>
	   The results themselves are not surprising: Bad hair days make people feel,
well, bad.
</P>
<P>
	   But it's the way those days mess with people's lives - making them feel less
smart, less capable, more embarrassed and less sociable - that surprised
researchers.
</P>
<P>
	   "If bad hair has negative effects over and above thinking about other
things, then we've got something that's real - something that's important," said
Marianne LaFrance, the Yale professor who did the study as part of her research
into body language and gender differences.
</P>
<P>
	   Contrary to popular notions, men's self-esteem may take a greater licking
than women's when their hair just won't behave. Men were especially more likely
to feel less smart and less capable when their hair stuck out, was badly cut or
otherwise mussed, the study found.
</P>
<P>
	   "The cultural truism is (that) men are not affected by their appearance,"
LaFrance said. "This is not just the domain of women."
</P>
<P>
	   The study was paid for by Procter &AMP; Gamble, which plans a new hair care line
called Physique intended to provide more control over hair.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cincinnati-based company would not discuss how much the study cost or
what they planned to do with their newfound knowledge about the psychology of
bad hair. But a spokeswoman for the company promised to share the study results.
</P>
<P>
	   "People across America know bad hair days exist, but consumers wonder, 'Is
this real?"' said spokeswoman Tracey Long.
</P>
<P>
	   For the study, researchers in December questioned 60 men and 60 women ages
17 to 30, most of them Yale students. About half the students were white, 9
percent were black, 21 percent were Asian, 3 percent were Hispanic and the rest
were other races or did not answer.
</P>
<P>
	   The people were divided into three groups. One group was questioned about
times in their lives when they have had bad hair and what bad hair means to
them.
</P>
<P>
	   The second group went through the same questions, but were instead told to
think about bad packaging, as a way to get them in a negative mindset.
</P>
<P>
	   The third group was not asked to think about anything negative.
</P>
<P>
	   All three groups then were asked to respond to basic psychological tests on
self-esteem and self-judgment.
</P>
<P>
	   The people who pondered their bad hair days showed lower self-esteem than
the people who thought about something else.
</P>
<P>
	   Some people seemed surprised to hear that Yale was studying something as
mundane as bad hair, but sufferers said they were interested in what science can
reveal about the fickleness of their follicles.
</P>
<P>
	   Andrea Thomas of East Haven, who tames her thick, dark hair into a neatly
feathered style, said she has wrestled with bad hair days and the bad moods they
bring.
</P>
<P>
	   "On humid days, it gets really frizzy or limp and I can't do anything,"
Thomas said. "You just have a bad day in general, but during the course of the
day you learn to live with it."
</P>
<P>
	   LaFrance, who has also studied the psychology of smiles, facial expressions
and body language, said she would continue to look into the larger effect bad
hair has on people's lives.
</P>
<P>
	   "We all do research that at first pass might seem quite small. Yes, some of
my colleagues said, 'That's interesting, ha, ha.' But then, when we talk about
it, people are interested. People have pointed out more than once that God is in
the details," LaFrance said.

<HEADLINE> McCall: State board poorly monitoring contribution reports  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - State Comptroller H. Carl McCall criticized the
state Board of Elections Tuesday for not reviewing financial disclosure reports
filed at each of the state's 58 local election boards.
<P>
	   An audit released by McCall listed 34 potential violations of corporate
campaign contribution limits filed with boards of elections in Albany, Erie,
Rockland, Suffolk, Tompkins and Westchester counties and in New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   "The laws are weak and weakly enforced and corporations can exceed the
$5,000 legal contribution limit by spreading contributions around to several
candidates in one county," McCall said. "There is no one adding up all these
contributions and instead of a system that routinely reviews all financial
filings and enforces the law, we have what amounts to an honor system in New
York."
</P>
<P>
	   The state Board of Elections is responsible for determining if state
contribution limits have been violated. The board is also required to report
violators to local district attorneys.
</P>
<P>
	   But officials from the board said they do not have the personnel to visit
the 58 local boards and review thousands of campaign filing documents. McCall
agreed that not having enough personnel is a problem for the board.
</P>
<P>
	   "Something we've discussed, however, is an electronic filing system for the
counties," said Lee Daghlian, a spokesman for the state Board of Elections.
"We've got an electronic system in place where state candidates file their
financial statements with the board, it would only be a logical extension for us
to extend this to local and county government as well."
</P>
<P>
	   McCall said he favors the extension of such a system and has urged the
commissioners of state elections board to seek legislation requiring state and
local candidates to file electronically.
</P>
<P>
	   McCall's auditors reviewed records from 11 county boards of election and
found 58 corporations that appeared to have contributed more than the $5,000
limit to campaign committees.
</P>
<P>
	   In June, 1999, the auditors provided information on potential violations to
board officials for review and investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   As of Dec. 3, 1999, state Board officials reported they had conducted
follow-up inquiries and determined 24 had not violated the law. The board is
continuing to review the 34 remaining entities.
</P>
<P>
	   "In 1998, I was elected to my second term as state Comptroller and I'm here
to tell you that I hope I never have to run for office under the same campaign
finance rules again," McCall said. "Years ago when I started out in public life,
campaigns were about issues, today they are about one thing, and only one thing
- money."
</P>
<P>
	   An advisory committee has been formed to counsel McCall about a possible run
for governor in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   The comptroller has already hired a veteran Democratic fund-raiser to begin
putting together his campaign war chest, something that appears badly in need of
help.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month, Gov. George Pataki reported to the state Board of
Elections that his campaign committee had $2.3 million in the bank. McCall
reported that his campaign committee had less than $73,000.
</P>
<P>
	   McCall spoke Tuesday at Albany's First Lutheran Church in an appearance
sponsored by the state Community of Churches.

<HEADLINE> 1930s Record May Be Sinatra's First  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    HOBOKEN, N.J. (AP) -- Experts say a lacquered aluminum record from the 1930s
could contain Frank Sinatra's first recording as a solo artist.
</P>
<P>
	   The recording, made by amateur musician Walter Costello, features Sinatra
singing "Roses of Picardy," accompanied by Costello on the accordion.
</P>
<P>
	   "My opinion is that the record is for real," said Tom Owen, a voice
identification expert. "If it's not Sinatra, it's the best fake you could do."
</P>
<P>
	   Sometime over the past decade, sound from the warped record was transferred
to a CD.
</P>
<P>
	   Costello's widow, Angela "Dolly" Calandriello, said she has no plans for the
disc other than to display it at a Sinatra mini-museum in Hoboken, called From
Here to Eternity.

<HEADLINE> Web Offers Pipeline for Indie Films  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- Two years ago at the Sundance Film Festival, Jason
Reitman found only theoretical interest in his short-film entry.
</P>
<P>
	   This year, he found an eager buyer for his new short subject amid bidders
hungry for quick-hit entertainment to distribute over the Internet and through
other new channels.
</P>
<P>
	   The 22-year-old Reitman, son of "Ghostbusters" director Ivan Reitman, signed
with AtomFilms, which acquires shorts to broadcast on its Web site and sells its
movies to run in theaters, airplanes and on television.
</P>
<P>
	   The short-subject movie, once mainly a lab exercise for directors to show
their talent in hopes of breaking into feature films, is becoming an end in
itself as technology creates different ways to deliver material to viewers.
</P>
<P>
	   Interest in short movies is hotter than ever at Sundance. Internet buyers
are cutting deals with directors of the 50-plus short films showing through next
weekend and are being inundated with videos from short moviemakers whose
features did not make the festival cut.
</P>
<P>
	   The festival includes seminars on distributing or marketing films over the
Internet. There's an interactive lounge showcasing new entertainment technology.
Companies such as Mediatrip.com and IFilms.com trolled the festival to meet with
filmmakers and hunt for Web site content. AtomFilms' staff cruised Park City in
a recreational vehicle where directors could drop off videos for the company to
consider.
</P>
<P>
	   The Internet is "great for filmmakers. It's a breakthrough. It's not the
old, difficult audition process," said Skip Paul, chief executive of IFilm,
which is trying to become an all-purpose Web destination for movie-makers. "If
their film is good, there's immediate exposure for it."
</P>
<P>
	   At Sundance in 1998, Reitman kept hearing about buyers interested in short
films such as his "Operation," a comedy about kidney stealing. But the interest
was hazy, and "Operation" never sold.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'd be told people were purchasing short films and I'd ask, 'Why, what are
they going to do with them?"' Reitman said.
</P>
<P>
	   His entry this year, the life-after-death comedy "In God We Trust," was
bought a few days into the festival to run on the distributor's Web site,
www.atomfilms.com. The company said it also is working on a deal to sell the
16-minute movie to a cable-TV channel and looks to market it to other outlets.
</P>
<P>
	   Under AtomFilms' standard deal, filmmakers such as Reitman are paid $500 to
$1,000 upfront then receive a percentage of revenues if their movies sell to TV,
airlines or other places. The most successful of AtomFilms' 800 shorts have
brought in nearly $100,000, said company founder Mika Salmi.
</P>
<P>
	   Only a fraction of Internet users have high-speed, broadband connections
needed to make viewing films practical. The download time even for the shortest
of shorts generally is too long for Web browsers over a telephone line.
</P>
<P>
	   Many colleges, though, already are wired for broadband, making campuses a
prime market for Internet entertainment.
</P>
<P>
	   Festival organizers are encouraged by the interest in short films but say
time will tell if it benefits filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's good if it gets the films to audiences that want to see them," said
John Cooper, Sundance associate director. "I still want to see someone make his
money back on a short film."

<HEADLINE> 'Millionaire' Has Ratings Monopoly  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- This is getting monotonous: "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"
was the most-watched TV show last week. And the second most popular. And the
third.
</P>
<P>
	   The game show gave ABC another weekly Nielsen Media Research victory, and
made a tight season race even tighter.
</P>
<P>
	   "Millionaire" drew 29.5 million viewers Sunday, competing against the Golden
Globe awards on NBC, and 30.1 million last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Thursday was the best, when 32.4 million people watched, just under the game
show's all-time biggest audience. It gave ABC a win on a night NBC is used to
dominating.
</P>
<P>
	   The "Millionaire" success hasn't necessarily translated to its imitators.
NBC is doing well with its "Twenty One" revival, but CBS's "Winning Lines" and
Fox's "Greed" had mediocre showings last week.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC averaged 15.8 million viewers in prime time last week (10.1 household
rating, 16 share). CBS had 12.9 million viewers (8.9 rating, 14 share), NBC had
12.8 million viewers (9.0 rating, 14 share), and Fox had 11.3 million viewers
(7.3 rating, 11 share).
</P>
<P>
	   The competition for top-rated network this season is remarkably close. NBC
holds an edge by one-tenth of a household rating point over CBS, with ABC
four-tenths of a point behind.
</P>
<P>
	   Measured in viewers instead of homes, ABC actually has the lead. Only an
average of 50,000 viewers separate ABC, CBS and NBC -- Nielsen's equivalent of
splitting hairs.
</P>
<P>
	   "Malcolm in the Middle" continues as a success story for Fox. With 19.2
million viewers, it was second only to a "Friends" rerun for most popular comedy
or drama series last week.
</P>
<P>
	   It softened the blow of other bad news for Fox: "Beverly Hills 90210"
announced this week it is calling it quits after this season. "Party of Five,"
which sank to 84th place in the ratings last week, is likely a goner, too.
</P>
<P>
	   UPN led the mini-networks with 3.9 million viewers last week (2.5 rating, 4
share), while the WB had 3.6 million (2.5 rating, 4 share) and Pax TV had 1
million viewers (0.8 rating, 1 share).
</P>
<P>
	   NBC's "Nightly News" led the evening news competition with an average of
12.8 million viewers (9.3 rating, 17 share), ABC's "World News Tonight" had 12.4
million viewers (9.0 rating, 17 share), and the "CBS Evening News" had 10.5
million viewers (7.8 rating, 14 share).
</P>
<P>
	   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of the nation's
estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the percentage of in-use
televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
	   For the week of Jan. 17-23, the top 10 shows, their networks and ratings
were:
</P>
<P>
	   "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" (Thursday), ABC, 19.6; "Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire" (Tuesday), ABC, 19.2; "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" (Sunday),
ABC, 17.4; "Golden Globe Awards," NBC, 15.0; NFC Football Championship Post-Game
Show," Fox, 14.1; "Friends," NBC, 13.3; "Everybody Loves Raymond," CBS, 12.3;
"Frasier," NBC, 12.3; "Jesse," NBC, 11.8; "NYPD Blue," ABC, 11.5.

<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly lower in a volatile session today as
investors' worries about higher interest rates outweighed another round of
strong corporate profit reports.
</P>
<P>
	   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 32.58 at 10,975.59. The blue-chip index appeared
ready to close lower for a sixth consecutive session. The Dow hasn't fallen for
six sessions in a row since January 1995.
</P>

4,095.94.

quarter-percentage point in its latest move to slow the economy's growth and
head off inflation. A growing number of economists fear that an increase next
week will be the first of several this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Higher interest rates can cut into corporate profits as it becomes more
expensive to borrow money.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think people want to see how the market digests higher interest rates,"
said Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. in Kansas
City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, the Conference Board reported consumer confidence soared in January
to the highest level ever reached in the 32 years that the data has been
compiled. The report suggested consumer spending, the primary engine of the
nation's economic growth, will continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
	   The report may add to the Fed's concern that the economy is growing too
quickly, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow's technology companies pulled the average lower today, with IBM off
3 1/2 at 118 and Hewlett-Packard down 3 1/4 at 109 3/4. Their weakness diluted
some substantial gains from Dow components Procter &AMP; Gamble and Disney.
</P>
<P>
	   Procter &AMP; Gamble rose 3 13/16 to 99 13/16. The company's stock price, which
tumbled last week as P&AMP;G held talks to acquire drug companies Warner-Lambert and
American Home Products, began its recovery yesterday after company officials
called off the talks. Today, P&AMP;G posted fiscal second-quarter earnings that beat
analysts' expectations, providing further punch to the stock.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney rose 4 1/2 to 37 a day after its earnings report topped expectations.
Disney shares also benefited from a management reorganization that will elevate
ABC network chief Robert Iger to second in command at Disney.
</P>
<P>
	   Merrill Lynch became the latest Wall Street brokerage to benefit from the
strong run of the bull market in late 1999. The company's net income more than
doubled in the fourth quarter to $764 million, or $1.80 per share, from $359
million, or 86 cents a share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Merrill Lynch were up 4 1/16 at 79 3/4.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 9-to-5 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 860.85 million shares, slightly ahead of
Monday's pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 6.58 to 516.37.

<HEADLINE> Yale study ponders psychology of bad hair days  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - Bad hair days affect not just what's on your
head, but what's in it.
<P>
	   A Yale University study of the psychology of bad hair days found that
people's self-esteem goes awry when their hair is out of place.
</P>
<P>
	   The results themselves are not surprising: Bad hair days make people feel,
well, bad.
</P>
<P>
	   But it's the way those days mess with people's lives - making them feel less
smart, less capable, more embarrassed and less sociable - that surprised
researchers.
</P>
<P>
	   "If bad hair has negative effects over and above thinking about other
things, then we've got something that's real - something that's important," said
Marianne LaFrance, the Yale professor who did the study as part of her research
into body language and gender differences.
</P>
<P>
	   Contrary to popular notions, men's self-esteem may take a greater licking
than women's when their hair just won't behave. Men were especially more likely
to feel less smart and less capable when their hair stuck out, was badly cut or
otherwise mussed, the study found.
</P>
<P>
	   "The cultural truism is (that) men are not affected by their appearance,"
LaFrance said. "This is not just the domain of women."
</P>
<P>
	   The study was paid for by Procter &AMP; Gamble, which plans a new hair care line
called Physique intended to provide more control over hair.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cincinnati-based company would not discuss how much the study cost or
what they planned to do with their newfound knowledge about the psychology of
bad hair. But a spokeswoman for the company promised to share the study results.
</P>
<P>
	   "People across America know bad hair days exist, but consumers wonder, 'Is
this real?"' said spokeswoman Tracey Long.
</P>
<P>
	   Janet Hyde, a psychology professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison
who conducts studies of body image and self-esteem, said personal appearance can
have an enormous impact on people, especially adolescents.
</P>
<P>
	   But Hyde, who had not seen LaFrance's study, said she was surprised to hear
that bad hair had a stronger effect on men than on women in some cases.
</P>
<P>
	   "Traditionally we think of women being more concerned with appearance than
men. Although men certainly have some concerns, women are more socialized to
think these things are important," Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
	   For the study, researchers in December questioned 60 men and 60 women ages
17 to 30, most of them Yale students. About half the students were white, 9
percent were black, 21 percent were Asian, 3 percent were Hispanic and the rest
were other races or did not answer.
</P>
<P>
	   The people were divided into three groups. One group was questioned about
times in their lives when they have had bad hair and what bad hair means to
them.
</P>
<P>
	   The second group went through the same questions, but were instead told to
think about bad packaging, as a way to get them in a negative mindset.
</P>
<P>
	   The third group was not asked to think about anything negative.
</P>
<P>
	   All three groups then were asked to respond to basic psychological tests on
self-esteem and self-judgment.
</P>
<P>
	   The people who pondered their bad hair days showed lower self-esteem than
the people who thought about something else.
</P>
<P>
	   Some people seemed surprised to hear that Yale was studying something as
mundane as bad hair, but sufferers said they were interested in what science can
reveal about the fickleness of their follicles.
</P>
<P>
	   Andrea Thomas of East Haven, who tames her thick, dark hair into a neatly
feathered style, said she has wrestled with bad hair days and the bad moods they
bring.
</P>
<P>
	   "On humid days, it gets really frizzy or limp and I can't do anything,"
Thomas said. "You just have a bad day in general, but during the course of the
day you learn to live with it."
</P>
<P>
	   LaFrance, who has also studied the psychology of smiles, facial expressions
and body language, said she would continue to look into the larger effect bad
hair has on people's lives.
</P>
<P>
	   "We all do research that at first pass might seem quite small. Yes, some of
my colleagues said, 'That's interesting, ha, ha.' But then, when we talk about
it, people are interested. People have pointed out more than once that God is in
the details," LaFrance said.

<HEADLINE> Xerox profits fall 52 percent in fourth quarter  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - Xerox Corp. will take a new round of cost-cutting
steps and roll out new products to improve its bottom line after reporting
Tuesday that fourth-quarter profits fell 52 percent.
<P>
	   Xerox President Rick Thoman said the company would look for efficiencies and
savings and may take a charge of "hundreds of millions of dollars" in the first
quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Virtually everything is on the table," Thoman said in a conference call
with industry analysts. "Some difficult choices must be made."
</P>
<P>
	   Net income in the fourth quarter was $294 million, or 41 cents per share,
compared with $615 million, or 84 cents per share, in the same period a year
ago. Revenues in the quarter fell 6 percent to $5.44 billion, compared with
$5.79 billion a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The company had warned last month that its fourth-quarter earnings would be
down, following an 11 percent decline in third-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
	   Xerox said the disappointing report was due to increased competitive
pressure, the reorganization of its sales force, economic troubles in Brazil,
unfavorable currency exchange and lower sales caused by customer Y2K anxiety.
</P>
<P>
	   "We recognize our shareholders aren't satisfied. They shouldn't be," Thoman
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Analyst Daniel Kunstler of J.P. Morgan said Xerox leaders are saying the
things investors want to hear, especially the admission of troubles in Brazil
and strong competition from other makers of computer printers and copiers.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's sort of like, 'Let's put on a happy face on this. Let's try to drum up
some positive sentiment,"' Kunstler said. "I think they have at least stepped
forward, making the picture a little crisper and a little less dire."
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, net income from continuing operations fell 16 percent to
$1.42 billion, or $1.96 per share, compared with $1.70 billion, or $2.33 per
share in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Including a 1998 restructuring charge of $1.10 billion and a discontinued
operations loss, Xerox reported 1998 net income of $395 million, or 52 cents per
share.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues for the full year fell 1 percent to $19.23 billion, compared with
$19.45 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Xerox warned again that the company will probably see a similar decline in
earnings in the first quarter and a smaller decline in the second quarter. The
company expects earnings growth later this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Thoman said the company has "turned the corner" on resolving its customer
administration issues in the United States and has completed its sales force
realignment. He also said the company would announce new products this year to
enhance its position in the digital office.
</P>
<P>
	   Xerox spokeswoman Christa Carone would not comment on whether there will be
more job cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   "We can't give any detail at all other than to say that ... we're looking at
all of our operations, with the exception of our sales force and our research
and development operations," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, the company streamlined its U.S. customer administration by
consolidating 36 billing centers across the country into three. It also
reorganized its 14,000-person sales force toward coverage of specific industries
and away from geographical coverage. Both moves caused disruption and slowed
productivity, the company said.
</P>
<P>
	   Thoman refuted reports that Xerox's sales force was jumping ship to
competitors because of declining morale and poor performance.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nobody's happy with our performance or the fact that the stock's down,"
Thoman said, but he added that the vast bulk of the sales force is "committed to
the company."

<HEADLINE> Circus at City Hall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Send in the clowns?
<P>
	   Two protesters from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals tossed phony
money into the air Tuesday at City Hall, just inches from Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, who was accepting the title "Ringmaster for Life" from a real
ringmaster and clowns from Ringling Bros. and Barnum &AMP; Bailey Circus.
</P>
<P>
	   The protesters, who chanted, "The elephants can't buy their freedom, but
Ringling bought you," claim the historic circus is cruel to its animals and that
Giuliani has been "bought" by Ringling Bros. because his exploratory U.S. Senate
campaign has accepted $2,000 from Kenneth Feld, a member of the family that owns
the circus.
</P>
<P>
	   After the disruption, Giuliani said he originally believed the protesters
were part of the collection of clowns and other costumed characters who gather
with the mayor at City Hall each year to announce that the circus is coming to
town. Once Giuliani realized the activists were not part of the show, his face
tightened in fear, but when he realized they intended him no physical harm, he
began laughing.
</P>
<P>
	   The disruption lasted about 25 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   "That was not part of the show," he said, smiling as the pair was dragged
from the room, still chanting. "But maybe it is in New York City, part of the
show."
</P>
<P>
	   Later, he joked that the protest was part of "a left wing conspiracy" - a
reference to first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's insistence last year that the
impeachment proceedings against President Clinton were part of "a vast right
wing conspiracy."
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton is expected to be Giuliani's opponent for a seat in the U.S.
Senate this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said the two demonstrators impersonated New York University
journalism students to breach the tight security at City Hall. For the past
year-and-a-half, Giuliani has ordered a beefed-up security presence at the
building to prevent possible terrorist attacks, including pop-up barricades to
block vehicles and police officers stationed around the perimeter to prevent
people without business there from entering.
</P>
<P>
	   To get to the Blue Room, where the press conference was held, the PETA
demonstrators would have had to pass through at least three different police
checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
	   "If they can breach security, anyone can breach security," Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
	   PETA identified the protesters as Luke Downing, 20, of Lincoln, Neb. and
Arathi Jayaram, 23, of Norfolk, Va. The two were charged with trespassing and
disorderly conduct.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, outside City Hall, two other PETA activists placed themselves in
tiny cages in the 20-degree cold and snow for about an hour Tuesday to protest
the treatment of the circus animals.
</P>
<P>
	   "Giuliani's turning his back on the suffering of animals," said Melinda
Duval, 34, of Norfolk, Va., from inside one of the cages.
</P>
<P>
	   During the past two years, several of Ringling's animal performers have
died, including an elephant that died of respiratory failure and a tiger that
was shot by the brother of its trainer. The trainer had been previously mauled
by the tiger.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Ringling spokeswoman Barbara Flughaupt said the circus' animals
are treated "extremely well."
</P>
<P>
	   About PETA, she said, "they don't believe in the training any animals at
all. Incrementally, they are for the segregation of all animals and people."

<HEADLINE> Advertisers Drawn To Super Bowl  </HEADLINE>
    By SKIP WOLLENBERG AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Tennessee Titans and the St. Louis Rams won't be the
only fresh names trying to score some points in this Sunday's Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   About dozen Internet companies are forking over the highest prices ever paid
for TV commercials so they can join regulars like Anheuser-Busch, Pepsi-Cola and
FedEx on the NFL championship game broadcast.
</P>
<P>
	   There were only two dot-coms in last year's game -- three if you count
lingerie marketer Victoria's Secret which advertised its fashion show Webcast.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some companies are out there on hope and a prayer, but it's part of the new
economy," said Jeffrey Taylor, chief executive of online job site Monster.com,
one of the Internet advertisers in the 1999 game.
</P>
<P>
	   Monster and a rival employment site, Hotjobs.com, each said that visits to
their sites soared after last year's Super Bowl exposure, and both are back.
Their experience fired the hopes of several of this year's young Internet
entrants.
</P>
<P>
	   Among them are information provider Britannica.com; the job site Kforce.com;
and women's Web site Oxygen.com.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC officials say the Internet companies helped push the commercial price to
an average of $2.2 million -- an astounding $733,333 per second -- for 61
half-minute commercials in the game. The top price for an ad was said to be over
$3 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The average is a whopping 38 percent more than the previous record $1.6
million that the Fox network claimed for ads in last year's Super Bowl. The
price went up even though the average audience rating tumbled 9 percent last
year to the lowest level since 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   The attraction is that the Super Bowl delivers the year's highest TV ratings
and audiences in the 120 million to 130 million range.
</P>
<P>
	   Anheuser-Busch, brewer of Budweiser, is the single biggest Super Bowl
advertiser with five minutes of commercial time in the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Its ads include one designed to tug on your heart strings by showing the
birth of a new Clydesdale horse and another with former hockey star Wayne
Gretzky driving a tipsy friend home from a bar -- on a Zamboni machine.
</P>
<P>
	   Pepsi-Cola will pitch its hot-selling Mountain Dew. One ad shows a bike
rider chasing a cheetah across African plains, capturing and reaching inside the
cat to retrieve a stolen can of Dew.
</P>
<P>
	   FedEx inserts a delivery truck into clips from the classic "Wizard of Oz"
movie to show it reaches "places other shipping companies can only imagine."
</P>
<P>
	   Pets.com's ad features its sock puppet singing "Don't Go" in a plea to
owners to spend more time with their pets by using the Web retailer for pet
supplies. Hotjobs.com shows its new computer hand icon driving a hard bargain in
a job interview while Tropicana pitches orange juice as "the best 9.3 seconds
you can possibly spend on yourself."
</P>
<P>
	   The World Wrestling Federation and Seven-Up each had ads rejected by the ABC
standards office, but came up with alternatives. The WWF, which won't specify
what ABC found objectionable, says its new ad shows "the unabashed excitement of
WWF fans in unexpected places." Seven-Up's original ad got thrown out because it
contained an off-color phrase. Its new one may not be much better. It shows a
fictional marketing executive exhorting consumers to "show us your cans."
</P>
<P>
	   The dot-coms include the well-established like E-Trade with $700 million in
revenue last year. Others are startups that are using investors' money for their
ads because they haven't yet generated enough revenue to pay the bill. They
include the wedding stationery supplier OurBeginning.com., technology adviser
Computer.com and financial portal OnMoney.
</P>
<P>
	   August Busch IV, head of marketing for Anheuser-Busch, says anticipation of
these expensive bids for recognition could ultimately benefit established brands
like his Budweiser.
</P>
<P>
	   "It heightens consumers' interest in the 'other game' being played along
with the Big Game," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some media buyers say the two small-market teams in this year's game could
lead to lower ratings since neither has a national following.
</P>
<P>
	   But others say the Super Bowl will attract a big audience no matter who is
in it -- and that a close game is the key to retaining viewers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Virtually the whole country comes to a standstill when the Super Bowl comes
on," said veteran commercial buyer Bill Croasdale of Western Initiative Media.
</P>
<P>
	   The Super Bowl is also an advertising showcase and viewers know it. Eight
percent of those watching Sunday's game will be tuning in just to see the ads,
researcher Eisner Communications found.

<HEADLINE> American Home Matches Forecasts  </HEADLINE>
    By PHIL GALEWITZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- American Home Products Corp., in the midst of a takeover
battle for Warner-Lambert Co. said its fourth-quarter earnings rose 1 percent,
well below the pharmaceutical industry's double-digit average.
</P>
<P>
	   The performance matched analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson &AMP; Johnson said its fourth-quarter profit jumped 12 percent excluding
unusual charges, exceeding Wall Street forecasts by a cent.
</P>
<P>
	   Madison, N.J.-based American Home said it earned $593.2 million or 45 cents
per share in the fourth quarter, compared to $590.1 million or 44 cents per
share in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The year-ago figures reflect a $240.5 million restructuring charge.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home's results met the predictions of analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thomson Financial. Shares of American Home fell $2.25 to $40.75 on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales rose 7 percent in the latest quarter to $3.47 billion from $3.23
billion. Drug sales rose 8 percent to $2.39 billion on strong sales of American
Home's rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel, which is co-marketed by Immunex, and
its hormone replacement drug Premarin.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1999, American Home took a $3.29 billion charge to pay the legal costs
associated with a national settlement of its diet drug lawsuits. Including that
charge, American Home lost $1.23 billion or 94 cents per share in 1999, compared
to a profit of $2.47 billion or $1.85 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding the unusual charges, American Home had a $2.33 billion profit or
$1.78 per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales in 1999 rose 2 percent to $13.55 billion from $13.46 billion. Drug
sales rose 7 percent for the year to $9.50 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the huge diet drug settlement, American Home was plagued by
poor sales of its herbicides and pesticides. Agricultural product sales rose 3
percent in the quarter, but fell 24 percent for all of 1999 to $1.67 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home and rival Pfizer Inc. have both made offers to buy
Warner-Lambert. On Monday, Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. said it would not pursue a bid
for both American Home and Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding special charges, New Brunswick, N.J.-based Johnson &AMP; Johnson had a
fourth-quarter profit of $796 million or 56 cents per share, compared to $712
million or 50 cents a share a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The special charges, which totaled $42 million, included costs of buying
biotechnology firm Centocor in 1999 and layoffs that occurred in 1998. Including
those charges, fourth-quarter profit was $754 million, or 53 cents per share,
compared with $102 million or 7 cents per share, in the year ago period.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial predicted earnings per
share of 55 cents for the latest quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales in the quarter rose 6.3 percent to $6.88 billion from $6.47 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, excluding special charges, the company's profit rose 13
percent to $4.2 billion or $2.94 per share, from $3.7 billion or $2.12 per share
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Including the charges, J&AMP;J's profit a year ago was $3 billion a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales for all of 1999 rose 14.5 percent to $27.47 billion from $24 billion
in 1998. Drug sales rose 20.2 percent to $10.7 billion during 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The company cited strong sales growth of its key products, including the
anemia drug Procrit, and the antipsychotic drug Risperdol.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of J&AMP;J rose $2.50 to $86 on the NYSE.

<HEADLINE> Appraiser describes, defends methodology for valuing land  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - A land appraiser for the federal government
explained to jurors Tuesday how he determined that New York should pay $335
million to the Cayuga Indian Nation for its lost ancestral lands.
<P>
	   Arvel M. Hale, the key witness for the Cayugas, also found himself defending
his appraisal approach against a steady stream of questions and objections from
the state's attorney as the damages trial entered its second day in U.S.
District Court.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury's job is to decide how much money the Cayugas should receive for
64,015 acres of their former territory in Seneca and Cayuga counties. Presiding
Judge Neal McCurn previously ruled that the land was illegally acquired by New
York state in 1795 and 1807 because the state did not obtain the federal
government's required approval for the transactions.
</P>
<P>
	   The state has said the land is worth no more than $46 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Responding to questions from Justice Department lawyer Hank Meshorer, Hale
described in detail how he used county real estate records on land use and data
on selected sales to come up with his figure of $264.7 million for the
present-day fair market value of the land.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, during his first day on the witness stand, Hale testified that 69
percent of the claim area was in agricultural use while another 17 percent was
residential. Eight percent of the land was vacant while the remainder was either
wild forest or parks or used for commercial, recreational, community service,
industrial or public service purposes, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   To reach his conclusion, Hale said he considered 5,647 tracts in the claim
area. Assistant Attorney General David Roberts made sure jurors knew that Hale
only briefly toured the area and did not inspect the tracts individually.
</P>
<P>
	   Hale acknowledged that he didn't actually appraise any of the properties
himself. Instead, he obtained records on 14,407 property sales, a number he
pared down to 153 by eliminating all sales that occurred before 1996 and all
sales that involved improved tracts.
</P>
<P>
	   In a prior ruling, McCurn said the land must be valued as unimproved
property.
</P>
<P>
	   Roberts again tried to undermine Hale's approach by questioning how
extensively he reviewed each record.
</P>
<P>
	   "You didn't personally review each individual sale? You hit a button on your
computer and ran a program?" Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I did not physically look at each record ... I wrote the program for the
computer. I developed the rules," Hale said in defense of his method.
</P>
<P>
	   As Hale went over his appraisal method, he used a computer and video screen
to help jurors understand his approach. Roberts challenged several of the charts
as they were introduced into evidence.
</P>
<P>
	   Hale also testified that he used a three-pronged analysis to derive at a
rental value of $70.4 million for the use and occupancy of the land over 204
years.
</P>
<P>
	   Because only spotty records existed between 1795-1899, Hale said he
established a rental value for that period by considering all the land
agricultural and then using deeds and sales records to determine what the
average fair market price was for an acre for each year during that span.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he set the rental value at 6 percent of the fair market value after
researching what a fair rate of return was during those years based on the
interest rates on government treasury bonds and on the interest rate New York
assessed when it sold off the Cayuga land at public auction in 1796.
</P>
<P>
	   The state's appraiser set the rental value at 2 percent and Roberts raised
repeated questions about Hale's decision to use 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   For the period from 1900-1960, Hale told jurors he based the land's rental
value on commodity yields and prices because there were no reliable rental
records available. For the modern era, he was able to use actual rental data
obtained from U.S Department of Agriculture reports, Hale testified.
</P>
<P>
	   Testimony continues Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Hormone Combination May Pose Risk  </HEADLINE>
    By LINDSEY TANNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Menopausal women using the common hormone supplements
estrogen and progestin run a 20 percent higher risk of breast cancer than those
who get estrogen alone, a study found.
</P>
<P>
	   While the risk of breast cancer is still low for women who take both
hormones, the increased odds might further complicate the decision menopausal
women must make about their health.
</P>
<P>
	   Estrogen is often prescribed to ease hot flashes and other menopause
symptoms. It also has been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease and brittle
bones.
</P>
<P>
	   After research in the 1980s linked estrogen use to uterine cancer, doctors
began prescribing it along with progestin, a synthetic form of the hormone
progesterone. It helps block estrogen's effect on the uterine lining.
</P>
<P>
	   Some previous studies have linked estrogen supplements, either alone or
combined with progestin, with higher rates of breast cancer. Other research has
found no increased risk.
</P>
<P>
	   Hormone-therapy proponents say the risks noted in the current study --
published in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association -- were too
small to be significant. Others contend the findings bolster the notion that
women weighing hormone use should proceed with caution.
</P>
<P>
	   "If a woman is experiencing severe menopausal symptoms that affect her
quality of life, fear of breast cancer shouldn't discourage short-term use,"
said Catherine Schairer, a National Cancer Institute epidemiologist and the
study's lead author. With long-term use, she said, there is "considerably more
concern."
</P>
<P>
	   The study gathered data on hormone use from questionnaires given to 46,355
women participating in a nationwide breast cancer screening project from 1980
through 1995. The survey identified 2,082 breast cancer cases.
</P>
<P>
	   Compared with women who reported never using hormones, women who used
estrogen within the previous four years faced a 20 percent higher risk of breast
cancer. For current or previous users of estrogen-progestin, the risk was 40
percent higher than for non-users.
</P>
<P>
	   For each year of use, the risk of developing breast cancer increased 1
percent for estrogen-only users and 8 percent for estrogen-progestin users.
</P>
<P>
	   Women who had been off either treatment for more than four years faced no
increased risk, regardless of how long they had taken hormones.
</P>
<P>
	   Three Harvard University doctors, Walter Willett, Graham Colditz and Meir
Stampfer, wrote an accompanying editorial urging further study of the long-term
use of both hormones.
</P>
<P>
	   They said that the uncertainties raised by the new study and others suggest
that long-term treatments other than estrogen and progestin be considered.
</P>
<P>
	   "The commonly held belief that aging routinely requires pharmacological
management has unfortunately led to neglect of diet and lifestyle as the primary
means to achieve healthy aging," they wrote. "Now is an appropriate time to
reassess this emphasis."
</P>
<P>
	   Surveys by the North American Menopause Society show that about a third of
U.S. women ages 45 to 65 -- some 16 million women -- use hormone supplements,
either estrogen alone or combined with progestin.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Wolf Utian, executive director of the Menopause Society, said of the new
study, "I'd have to see another one or two papers at least before I'd accept
this as gospel."

<HEADLINE> Treatment for Mentally Ill Compared  </HEADLINE>
    By LINDSEY TANNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- A study of 113,000 heart attack victims found that people
with mental illnesses are much less likely to receive a bypass, angioplasty or
other common, aggressive treatments.
</P>
<P>
	   Previous research has found similar disparities in cardiac treatment for
women and blacks. The researchers in the new study suggested that for the
mentally ill, bias among doctors is at play.
</P>
<P>
	   "These differences in procedure rates could be used as a marker for
potentially larger difficulties in the health care system," said Dr. Benjamin G.
Druss, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Yale University. "They are a red
flag that we need to look at the issue more carefully."
</P>
<P>
	   The study was published in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
	   The authors reviewed data on Medicare recipients nationwide ages 65 and
older who were hospitalized for heart attacks in 1994 and 1995. Of those, 5,365
had been diagnosed with mental disorders such as schizophrenia, depression and
substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers examined what procedures the patients received, including
cardiac catheterization -- the "gold standard" diagnostic test for heart
disease. It involves squirting dye into cardiac arteries and X-raying them to
locate blockages and determine whether treatments such as angioplasty or bypass
surgery should follow.
</P>
<P>
	   Mental patients were 28 percent less likely to undergo catheterization, 25
percent less likely to undergo angioplasty -- in which a tiny balloon is
inflated inside an artery to clear away fatty buildup -- and 32 percent less
likely to have bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no significant differences in the death rates for both groups
within 30 days of hospital admission. However, Druss said that finding is not as
important as possible differences in the long-term outcome. The study did not
look beyond 30 days.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers said possible reasons for the treatment disparities include
the attitudes of mental patients and the doctors who treat them.
</P>
<P>
	   Some patients might reject a doctor's recommendations or be unable to give
informed consent about treatment. The researchers also said doctors might fear
mental patients would be unable to adhere to treatment regimens or might feel
they are less deserving of aggressive care.
</P>
<P>
	   "Mental disorders continue to carry stigma in both the general community and
medical settings," the researchers wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Roy Ziegelstein, a cardiologist at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center
in Baltimore, said the study "raises an incredibly important issue, and that is,
are people treated differently medically as a result of something other than the
medical disorder?"
</P>
<P>
	   "It doesn't really answer the question," he said. "It puts it on the radar
screen as an important issue to look at."

<HEADLINE> Advertisers Drawn To Super Bowl  </HEADLINE>
    By SKIP WOLLENBERG AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Tennessee Titans and the St. Louis Rams won't be the
only fresh names trying to score some points in this Sunday's Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   About dozen Internet companies are forking over the highest prices ever paid
for TV commercials so they can join regulars like Anheuser-Busch, Pepsi-Cola and
FedEx on the NFL championship game broadcast.
</P>
<P>
	   There were only two dot-coms in last year's game -- three if you count
lingerie marketer Victoria's Secret which advertised its fashion show Webcast.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some companies are out there on hope and a prayer, but it's part of the new
economy," said Jeffrey Taylor, chief executive of online job site Monster.com,
one of the Internet advertisers in the 1999 game.
</P>
<P>
	   Monster and a rival employment site, Hotjobs.com, each said that visits to
their sites soared after last year's Super Bowl exposure, and both are back.
Their experience fired the hopes of several of this year's young Internet
entrants.
</P>
<P>
	   Among them are information provider Britannica.com; the job site Kforce.com;
and women's Web site Oxygen.com.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC officials say the Internet companies helped push the commercial price to
an average of $2.2 million -- an astounding $73,333 per second -- for 61
half-minute commercials in the game. The top price for an ad was said to be over
$3 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The average is a whopping 38 percent more than the previous record $1.6
million that the Fox network claimed for ads in last year's Super Bowl. The
price went up even though the average audience rating tumbled 9 percent last
year to the lowest level since 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   The attraction is that the Super Bowl delivers the year's highest TV ratings
and audiences in the 120 million to 130 million range.
</P>
<P>
	   Anheuser-Busch, brewer of Budweiser, is the single biggest Super Bowl
advertiser with five minutes of commercial time in the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Its ads include one designed to tug on your heart strings by showing the
birth of a new Clydesdale horse and another with former hockey star Wayne
Gretzky driving a tipsy friend home from a bar -- on a Zamboni machine.
</P>
<P>
	   Pepsi-Cola will pitch its hot-selling Mountain Dew. One ad shows a bike
rider chasing a cheetah across African plains, capturing and reaching inside the
cat to retrieve a stolen can of Dew.
</P>
<P>
	   FedEx inserts a delivery truck into clips from the classic "Wizard of Oz"
movie to show it reaches "places other shipping companies can only imagine."
</P>
<P>
	   Pets.com's ad features its sock puppet singing "Don't Go" in a plea to
owners to spend more time with their pets by using the Web retailer for pet
supplies. Hotjobs.com shows its new computer hand icon driving a hard bargain in
a job interview while Tropicana pitches orange juice as "the best 9.3 seconds
you can possibly spend on yourself."
</P>
<P>
	   The World Wrestling Federation and Seven-Up each had ads rejected by the ABC
standards office, but came up with alternatives. The WWF, which won't specify
what ABC found objectionable, says its new ad shows "the unabashed excitement of
WWF fans in unexpected places." Seven-Up's original ad got thrown out because it
contained an off-color phrase. Its new one may not be much better. It shows a
fictional marketing executive exhorting consumers to "show us your cans."
</P>
<P>
	   The dot-coms include the well-established like E-Trade with $700 million in
revenue last year. Others are startups that are using investors' money for their
ads because they haven't yet generated enough revenue to pay the bill. They
include the wedding stationery supplier OurBeginning.com., technology adviser
Computer.com and financial portal OnMoney.
</P>
<P>
	   August Busch IV, head of marketing for Anheuser-Busch, says anticipation of
these expensive bids for recognition could ultimately benefit established brands
like his Budweiser.
</P>
<P>
	   "It heightens consumers' interest in the 'other game' being played along
with the Big Game," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some media buyers say the two small-market teams in this year's game could
lead to lower ratings since neither has a national following.
</P>
<P>
	   But others say the Super Bowl will attract a big audience no matter who is
in it -- and that a close game is the key to retaining viewers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Virtually the whole country comes to a standstill when the Super Bowl comes
on," said veteran commercial buyer Bill Croasdale of Western Initiative Media.
</P>
<P>
	   The Super Bowl is also an advertising showcase and viewers know it. Eight
percent of those watching Sunday's game will be tuning in just to see the ads,
researcher Eisner Communications found.

<HEADLINE> Teacher Exam Scores Delayed  </HEADLINE>
   By ANJETTA McQUEEN AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is buckling to pressure from
colleges in delaying a requirement that they report the scores of their
graduates on teacher licensing exams, a key Democrat in Congress charged
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The reports were to begin this April under a 1998 student aid law but the
Education Department is delaying them a year, claiming they didn't have enough
time to create one reporting system for varying state exams.
</P>
<P>
	   The law also directed states to publicly identify colleges that consistently
produced poor teaching candidates. And based on that information, the Education
Department was to begin withholding federal aid to poor-performing colleges.
</P>
<P>
	   ``College presidents are going to be embarrassed how poorly their schools of
education are doing; some governors are going to be embarrassed,'' Rep. George
Miller, D-Calif., said Tuesday. ``It's a political year and the administration
has made a political choice.''
</P>
<P>
	   Miller, a senior member of the House Education and the Workforce Committee,
wrote the report card requirement that colleges receiving federal financial aid
disclose how graduates perform on their state teacher licensing exams.
</P>
<P>
	   Maureen McLaughlin, an Education Department deputy, said the delay occurred
because the qualifying exams are different from state to state and colleges and
states had different ideas on just what should be reported.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, she said, some states allowed teacher candidates to take the
licensing test more than once. And colleges wanted the best score of their
graduates reported, not just the initial one.
</P>
<P>
	   Miller said in a telephone interview Tuesday he's still writing a protest
letter to Education Secretary Richard Riley. Sen. Jeff Bingaman, the New Mexico
Democrat who sponsored the law in the Senate, is also concerned about the delay,
said his spokesman, Jim Bonham.
</P>
<P>
	   Colleges are siding with the Education Department in the dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unlike law or medicine where everyone takes a single national test, there
are forty-some different testing programs and it's very difficult to develop a
single national indicator,'' said Terry Hartle, senior vice president of the
American Council on Education, a Washington-based college trade group.

<HEADLINE> Raytheon's Earnings Drop 79 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LEXINGTON, Mass. (AP) -- Raytheon Co. said Tuesday its fourth-quarter
earnings plunged 79 percent, a drop larger than Wall Street analysts had
projected for the defense contractor.
</P>
<P>
	   The company blamed a decline in revenue on lower missile shipments as well
as aircraft production delays and accounting changes mandated by the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   Net income was $72 million, or 21 cents a share, in the October-December
period, down from $341 million, or $1 per share, a year earlier. Analysts
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had predicted earnings of 22 cents a
share.
</P>
<P>
	   Raytheon said that accounting changes to bring it in compliance with SEC
rules resulted in fourth-quarter costs of 11 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue was $4.83 billion, down 8 percent from $5.26 billion the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
	   Raytheon last week warned investors that fourth-quarter earnings would be
lower than projected for the second straight quarter. The warning came after the
company announced plans in November to eliminate its biggest division, Raytheon
Systems Co., streamline management, and revise the way financial information is
shared within the company.
</P>
<P>
	   Class B shares in Raytheon were trading in late afternoon at $19.93 3/4, up
$1.62 1/2 or about 8.8 percent, on the New York Stock Exchange. Class A shares
were at $19.87 1/2, up $1.56 1/4 or about 8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Net income for the year was $404 million, or $1.19 a share, compared with
$844 million, or $2.47 a share, in 1998. Excluding a $53 million accounting
charge, net income in 1999 was $457 million, or $1.34 a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue for the year was $19.84 billion, up 2 percent from $19.42 billion in
1998. The company said the increase reflected stronger sales in missile defense
systems and some improvement in the power business of Raytheon Engineers &AMP;
Constructors.

<HEADLINE> Merrill Lynch Beats Expectations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The booming stock market allowed Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., the
largest brokerage firm in the United States, to double its fourth-quarter
earnings from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York-based company reported earnings Tuesday of $764 million, easily
beating analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's profits represent earnings of $1.80 a share, well above the
$1.39 a share analysts had predicted, according to First Call Corp. In the
fourth quarter of 1998, Merrill Lynch reported profits of $359 million, or 86
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourth-quarter profits were down across Wall Street last year, as securities
firms contended with the fallout from the Asian and Russian financial crises.
</P>
<P>
	   Merrill Lynch attributed the strong results to record revenues in its
investment banking business, which includes underwriting initial public stock
offerings and providing advice on mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
	   Total fourth-quarter revenues were $5.9 billion, up from $4.1 billion a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
	   "A strong fourth quarter capped a very strong year. Investors embraced our
new choice platform combining technology with advice and guidance, and brought
new assets to Merrill Lynch at an accelerating rate," said Merrill Lynch
chairman David Komansky.
</P>
<P>
	   Like many old line Wall Street brokerage firms, Merrill Lynch this year
began offering clients online trading services at lower rates than their
traditional full service brokerage fees.
</P>
<P>
	   For the full year, Merrill Lynch posted earnings of $2.6 billion, or $6.17 a
share, up from $1.3 billion, or $3 a share, in 1998, when the company reported a
one-time loss of $430 million related to staff layoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   Full year revenues came to $21.9 billion, compared to $17.5 billion a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors interpreted the earnings as good news, pushing shares of Merrill
Lynch up $3.87 1/2 cents to $79.56 1/4 in trading on the New York Stock
Exchange.

<HEADLINE> FDIC Proposes Doubling Funding  </HEADLINE>
   By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., concerned about its
biggest losses from bank failures since the early 1990s, is proposing doubling
the minimum required funding for banks that specialize in risky loans to people
with inferior credit histories.
</P>
<P>
	   Regulators have warned that the higher-interest loans, called subprime
loans, can increase the risk of defaults for the deposit insurance fund. They
played a role in some of the eight U.S. bank failures last year, which cost the
FDIC about $1 billion -- its biggest annual hit since the regional banking
crises of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   The failures, coming amid a booming economy, have worried regulators and
lawmakers. Compounding the concern, the FDIC is predicting that as many as 20
banks could go under this year.
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech last November, Donna Tanoue, the FDIC chairwoman, floated the
idea of increasing the required capital that banks and thrifts doing a lot of
subprime lending must have on hand.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe thrifts and banks with high concentrations of subprime loans
should be required to hold more capital than the current rules now dictate. A
lot more,'' Ms. Tanoue told bankers.
</P>
<P>
	   Now the FDIC has circulated a draft to the other federal banking agencies,
including the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,
which must all agree on a formal proposal to be put out for public comment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We know that they have a proposal out there for discussion purposes,''
David Runkel, a spokesman for the House Banking Committee, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of a federal government shutdown in Washington due to the East Coast
snowstorm, spokesmen for the FDIC and other banking agencies couldn't be reached
for comment on the proposal. It was first reported in Tuesday's editions of The
Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
	   There has been disagreement over the FDIC's proposed definition of subprime
borrowers, The Journal reported. Critics of the proposal have maintained that
under the definition -- borrowers who have made two payments 30 or more days
late or one payment 60 or more days late -- many community banks that lend to
low- and moderate-income people would be adversely affected.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDIC says it has found about 150 banks and thrifts with significantly
high levels of subprime loans. Together, those institutions hold about 5 percent
of total banking industry assets.
</P>
<P>
	   The Banking Commitee chairman, Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, recently proposed
legislation that would give the head of the FDIC more authority over troubled
banks. His proposal was prompted by the failure last fall of First National Bank
of Keystone, a bank based in Keystone, W.Va., that grew by paying high interest
rates to attract capital from across the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The estimated $750 million loss to the FDIC insurance fund caused by
Keystone's failure could make it one of the 10 most expensive ever in this
country, with losses approaching 70 percent of the bank's assets. Federal
regulators, who closed the bank in September, said they found evidence of
apparent fraud that resulted in the depletion of its capital. They alleged, for
example, that $515 million in loans fraudulently remained on Keystone's books
after they had been sold.
</P>
<P>
	   Leach has said there are indications the regulators may not have properly
supervised Keystone when it engaged in risky financial strategies, and that the
FDIC was stymied at key points by other federal banking agencies in its desire
to examine the bank's activities.
</P>
<P>
	   Leach didn't immediately return a telephone call seeking comment Tuesday on
the FDIC's capital requirement proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   The bank insurance fund, which backs each account up to $100,000, has an
adequate cushion -- now some $29 billion -- to cover depositors' losses.
</P>
<P>
	   Through most of the 1990s, there were fewer than 10 bank failures a year.
But in 1992, at the height of the banking crisis, 122 banks failed, mostly in
Texas and New England as their oil and real estate booms, respectively,
collapsed.

<HEADLINE> Treatment for Mentally Ill Compared  </HEADLINE>
    By LINDSEY TANNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- A study of 113,000 heart attack victims found that people
with mental illnesses are much less likely to receive a bypass, angioplasty or
other common, aggressive treatments.
</P>
<P>
	   Previous research has found smaller disparities in cardiac treatment for
women and blacks. The researchers in the new study suggested that for the
mentally ill, bias among doctors is at play.
</P>
<P>
	   "These differences in procedure rates could be used as a marker for
potentially larger difficulties in the health care system," said Dr. Benjamin G.
Druss, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Yale University. "They are a red
flag that we need to look at the issue more carefully."
</P>
<P>
	   The study was published in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
	   The authors reviewed data on Medicare recipients nationwide ages 65 and
older who were hospitalized for heart attacks in 1994 and 1995. Of those, 5,365
had been diagnosed with mental disorders such as schizophrenia, depression and
substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers examined what procedures the patients received, including
cardiac catheterization -- the "gold standard" diagnostic test for heart
disease. It involves squirting dye into cardiac arteries and X-raying them to
locate blockages and determine whether treatments such as angioplasty or bypass
surgery should follow.
</P>
<P>
	   Mental patients were 28 percent less likely to undergo catheterization, 25
percent less likely to undergo angioplasty -- in which a tiny balloon is
inflated inside an artery to clear away fatty buildup -- and 32 percent less
likely to have bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no significant differences in the death rates for both groups
within 30 days of hospital admission. However, Druss said that finding is not as
important as possible differences in the long-term outcome. The study did not
look beyond 30 days.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers said possible reasons for the treatment disparities include
the attitudes of mental patients and the doctors who treat them.
</P>
<P>
	   Some patients might reject a doctor's recommendations or be unable to give
informed consent about treatment. The researchers also said doctors might fear
mental patients would be unable to adhere to treatment regimens or might feel
they are less deserving of aggressive care.
</P>
<P>
	   "Mental disorders continue to carry stigma in both the general community and
medical settings," the researchers wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Roy Ziegelstein, a cardiologist at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center
in Baltimore, said the study "raises an incredibly important issue, and that is,
are people treated differently medically as a result of something other than the
medical disorder?"
</P>
<P>
	   "It doesn't really answer the question," he said. "It puts it on the radar
screen as an important issue to look at."

<HEADLINE> Consumer Confidence Hits High  </HEADLINE>
    By SETH SUTEL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Consumer confidence, a key indicator measuring the force
behind the economy's long expansion, soared in January to the highest level ever
reached in the 32 years that the data has been compiled, the Conference Board
reported today.
</P>
<P>
	   "People looking for confirmation that the consumer confidence bubble will
soon burst have a further wait in store," said Lynn Franco, research director
for the Conference Board.
</P>
<P>
	   "An expanding global economy and a robust job market suggest that consumer
optimism and consumer spending could rise even further in coming months," Franco
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The consumer confidence index rose to 144.7 in January, up from 141.7 in
December. It was the highest level measured in the 32 years that the
business-financed research group has been keeping records on the data and a
stronger-than-expected performance.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumer sentiment is closely watched by economists since spending by
consumers is a major engine behind the current economic boom, making up about
two-thirds of the nation's overall economic activity.
</P>
<P>
	   "Consumers have every reason to be optimistic. There is just nothing going
wrong," said Mark Zandi, an economist at Regional Financial Associates in West
Chester, Pa.
</P>
<P>
	   "Unemployment is as low as its ever been, wage growth is robust and
accelerating, and most important of all is the booming stock market," he said.
"Until the stock market cools, confidence will not weaken and consumers will not
stop spending."
</P>
<P>
	   Both components of the confidence index improved -- consumers' assessment of
current business conditions as well as their expectations for the future.
</P>
<P>
	   The monthly survey of 5,000 U.S. households reported 47 percent of those
responding rated the current business environment "good" and 54 percent said
jobs were "plentiful."
</P>
<P>
	   The strong reading is another indicator of the staying power of the current
expansion in the U.S. economy, which began in March of 1991. The expansion tied
the record 106-month expansion of the 1960s and surpasses it next month.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the report could also add to worries about inflation down the road
and pre-emptory strikes against it in the way of interest rate increases from
the Federal Reserve. The Fed's policy-making committee meets next week to decide
whether to change interest rates for the fourth time since last June.
</P>
<P>
	   In a separate report, the National Association of Realtors reported today
that sales of existing homes soared 4.6 percent last year, reaching a record
5.197 million. Rising mortgage rates, however, led to a 1.4 percent decline in
December.
</P>
<P>
	   The bond market, which is highly sensitive to concerns about inflation, took
the strong reading in stride. Most bond prices were slightly lower in afternoon
trading except for the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, which edged higher.
Stock prices closed higher, shaking off earlier losses.
</P>
<P>
	   The Conference Board's report also said that consumers' optimism about
future economic conditions is continuing to improve. The percentage of
respondents anticipating better business conditions over the next six months
rose to 19.6 percent from 17.5 percent last month. Those expecting conditions to
worsen fell to 3.3 percent from 4.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> New Health Plan by Surgeon General  </HEADLINE>
   By KAREN GULLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Like a demanding gym teacher with a very loud whistle,
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala exhorted Americans on Tuesday
to get off the couch and start walking, running or doing something -- anything
-- that resembles exercise.
</P>
<P>
	   With more and more people loosening their belts to accommodate a widening
girth, Surgeon General David Satcher and Shalala recommended that people start
eating more fruits and vegetables and that adults engage in moderate physical
activity for at least 30 minutes a day. They recommended that teens engage in 20
minutes of vigorous physical activity three or more times per week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we work together, if we dedicate ourselves to this national agenda,
America will become an even healthier nation 10 years from now,'' Shalala said.
``We had two important objectives in mind ... We wanted to ensure that Americans
not only added years to their lives, but added health to those years.''
</P>
<P>
	   Satcher and Shalala enlisted members of the U.S. women's World Cup
championship soccer team to help launch a campaign to improve the collective
health of the country. Goalkeeper Saskia Webber said she hopes to convince
people that physical education is as important to a child's schooling as English
and math.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One of the worst cutbacks I think in today's society is the physical
education programs in schools,'' Webber said. ``It's a fact that, women
especially, (who) are involved in athletics and soccer are more likely to
graduate, are less likely to become pregnant, are less likely to become drug
users.''
</P>
<P>
	   Shalala, the daughter of a gym teacher, characterized the loss of physical
education in many schools as a ``national tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Shalala's and Satcher's ``Healthy People 2010'' is the federal government's
third decade-long public health plan. But Shalala said there is added urgency to
the message this time because advances in modern medicine can only do so much to
reverse the effects of an unhealthy lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan aims for 30 percent of Americans to exercise 30 minutes each day --
today only 15 percent of the population does -- and reduce by half the number of
overweight or obese children, now about 11 percent of kids.
</P>
<P>
	   They want teen-agers to quit smoking, cut drug use and either abstain from
sex or use condoms.
</P>
<P>
	   The surgeon general will keep statistics on 10 topics -- called ``leading
health indicators'' -- that include a broad range of health issues and social
concerns. Satcher's office will collect data from state and local health
agencies and from federal agencies that will track each year whether Americans
are reaching goals set by the program.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to working on traditional health goals such as increasing the
number of children getting vaccinated and persuading people to exercise more,
the program targets increasing access to health insurance, reducing homicides
and even preventing fatal car crashes.
</P>
<P>
	   Tracking the 10 indicators is the cornerstone for another goal for the
surgeon general: eliminating racial disparities in health, an idea introduced by
President Clinton last year. Americans of all racial and ethnic groups are
healthier than they were a decade ago, but considerable disparities exist among
whites and other races.

<HEADLINE> Minnesota Congressman Visits Cuba  </HEADLINE>
   By FREDERIC J. FROMMER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Minnesota congressman plans to push for an agricultural
trade mission to Cuba this year with an eye toward ultimately lifting the U.S.
trade embargo against the communist country.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Dave Minge made a one-day trip to Cuba last weekend and met with
commerce and foreign ministries officials.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This trip has motivated me to take a keen interest in the embargo problem,
and try to end the embargo and open normal relations with Cuba,'' the four-term
Democrat said in an interview Tuesday. ``I think it's counterproductive. ... The
Cold War is over.''
</P>
<P>
	   The United States severed diplomatic relations with Cuba in January 1961,
two years after Fidel Castro's rise to power, and initiated a trade embargo in
1962. Travel to and from the country is restricted by the U.S. government, but
athletic, cultural and academic exchanges have been allowed.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration has consistently opposed ending the embargo, and
all major presidential candidates have taken similar stands.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, many farm-state lawmakers in both parties would like to see the
embargo lifted. They see the nation of 11 million people as a potential market
at a time of falling farm prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Minge, a member of the House Agriculture Committee, said Cuban officials
told him their country imports $62 million worth of powdered milk, $50 million
worth of beans and peas, $80 million worth of soy products and $77 million worth
of corn each year.
</P>
<P>
	   But before anything can change, ``the situation with the little boy needs to
be resolved,'' Minge said, referring to an international tug of war over
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, who was rescued at sea after his mother and
stepfather drowned trying to reach the United States.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Mostly Up; Dow Up 21.72  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks ended a highly volatile session mostly higher today
as investors rewarded companies that posted strong earnings reports for the
final quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   But market averages pitched wildly as the threat of rising interest rates
convinced many investors that corporate profits may be pinched later this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 21.72 to close at 11,029.89. The
blue-chip index dropped as much as 124.72 points earlier in the session and had
appeared to be on track for its sixth consecutive decline.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators also bounced back from major losses to finish
higher.
</P>
<P>
	   The the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 8.51 to 1,410.04, and the Nasdaq
composite index rose 71.34 to 4,167.42.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-5 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 1,771 down, 1,274 up and 473 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 1.06 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.10 billion in
the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.38 to 521.57.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors struggled to chart a course today as the latest reports of robust
corporate profits were nearly overshadowed by growing worries that rising
interest rates will make it difficult for companies to repeat their solid
performances.
</P>
<P>
	   Higher interest rates can cut into corporate profits as it becomes more
expensive to borrow money.
</P>
<P>
	   Next week, the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates a
quarter-percentage point in its latest move to slow the economy's growth and
head off inflation. A growing number of economists fear that an increase next
week will be the first of several this year.
</P>
<P>
	   "The market is volatile because investors have a lot of questions," said
Alan Skrainka, chief market strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis. "They're
wondering how aggressively the Fed will raise rates and whether the high
valuation of stocks is justified, especially if rates are going higher."
</P>
<P>
	   Many high-priced technology stocks fell today. Those companies are viewed as
especially vulnerable to rising interest rates, because they attract investors
by promising strong earnings growth in the future.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow's technology companies pulled the average lower today, with IBM and
Hewlett-Packard down substantially.
</P>
<P>
	   But investors found reasons to buy some moderately priced technology names.
Biogen rose, continuing a resurgence of biotechnology stocks. Software maker
Oracle also rose.
</P>
<P>
	   Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. in
Kansas City, Mo., said he expects bargain-hunting to continue while some
large-capitalization technology stocks languish.
</P>
<P>
	   "This year, I think we're seeing a more common-sense approach to the
market," he said. "Some of the big names are down, but people are doing some
good analysis and stock picking, and are looking for good deals."
</P>
<P>
	   Also today, investors rewarded blue-chip companies Procter &AMP; Gamble and
Disney for strong earnings reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Procter &AMP; Gamble, which saw its stock price edge higher Monday as it called
off takeover talks with drug companies Warner-Lambert and American Home
Products, rose substantially today. P&AMP;G also posted fiscal second-quarter
earnings that beat analysts' expectations, providing further punch to the stock.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney rose a day after its earnings report topped expectations. Investors
also applauded a management reorganization that will elevate ABC network chief
Robert Iger to second in command at Disney.
</P>
<P>
	   Merrill Lynch became the latest Wall Street brokerage to benefit from the
strong run of the bull market in late 1999. The company's net income more than
doubled in the fourth quarter to $764 million, or $1.80 per share, from $359
million, or 86 cents a share, a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton Raises Gender Issue  </HEADLINE>
   By MARC HUMBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton suggested Tuesday that some
people may dislike her because she is a woman in public life -- or maybe it's
her hairdo.
</P>
<P>
	   She later said she was kidding about the gender remark but added that ``it
would be great if New York joined the rest of the country in electing a woman
statewide.''
</P>
<P>
	   New York has never elected a woman running alone to statewide office, though
three have been elected lieutenant governor as part of a single ticket with a
governor.
</P>
<P>
	   The state's current governor, Republican George Pataki, said after being
told of Mrs. Clinton's remark: ``I don't think gender has anything to do with
it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki, a supporter of New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the Republican
expected to oppose Mrs. Clinton, a Democrat, in the Senate campaign this year,
said:
</P>
<P>
	   ``When you don't live in a state, I don't care what your gender is, it's a
legitimate issue. When you have certain philosophical positions that are, I
believe, out of touch with the vast majority of New Yorkers, that's a legitimate
concern.''
</P>
<P>
	   During a morning interview with Albany's WGY-AM radio, Mrs. Clinton was
told, ``In certain circles, just mention your name and you've got foaming at the
mouth.''
</P>
<P>
	   After laughter from the first lady, morning show host Don Weeks asked if she
``ever tried to understand that venom and does it bother you?''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know that it's out there and I think some of it is because of the
positions that I've taken and maybe a little of it is because I'm a woman taking
those positions,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``And, maybe some of it is people don't
like my hair style. I don't know what it is.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some recent polls have shown Mrs. Clinton running almost even with Giuliani
among female voters. Given that, independent pollster Lee Miringoff said it
would be logical to try to appeal to women voters by portraying herself as a
victim of gender discrimination.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's been an eroding of the gender gap,'' the head of Marist College's
Institute for Public Opinion said. ``Clearly, she needs to win and win big among
women to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
	   On another topic, Mrs. Clinton said she had received a warm welcome from her
new neighbors in suburban Westchester County but had ``taken every chance I
could to apologize to my neighbors because there are satellite trucks and errant
press people tromping through their backyards with their telephoto lenses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Don't tell anybody this, but I don't have any curtains yet so, gosh, I
don't know what they might be seeing,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton also stole a phrase from her husband as she discussed her
adopted state's high energy costs, stiff property taxes and hefty in-state
airfares.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now that I'm a resident, I can share your pain,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T 4Q Profits Decline  </HEADLINE>
    By BRUCE MEYERSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T is making big strides toward building its new
telephone and Web business over cable TV lines, but the high cost of reinventing
the company weighed on fourth-quarter profits.
</P>
<P>
	   By the end of the year, AT&AMP;T had 207,000 subscribers for high-speed Internet
access via cable, an increase of 80,000 during the final three months of 1999,
and the company was installing the service at about 1,000 homes a day.
</P>
<P>
	   Local phone service, meanwhile, was being tested on cable systems in nine
markets by year-end, AT&AMP;T said Tuesday, standing by projections that it would
have between 400,000 and 500,000 customers for that offering by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Naturally, however, the bottom line was hit hard by the hefty expense of
introducing those services on outdated cable systems, mostly those acquired with
Tele-Communications Inc., as well as upgrading and increasing capacity on AT&AMP;T's
overtaxed wireless network.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourth-quarter net income was $1.15 billion, or 36 cents a share, including
one-time factors. In the year-ago period, AT&AMP;T earned $1.99 billion, or 75 cents
a share, including a one-time gain.
</P>
<P>
	   The company didn't provide a quarterly tally of its capital expenditures
with its report on the final months of last year, but the total for all of 1999
reached $13.5 billion, with about three-quarters of the total going to
growth-oriented projects such as cable and wireless.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, AT&AMP;T topped most Wall Street forecasts for the fourth quarter,
earning $1.84 billion, or 57 cents per share, excluding one-time factors.
</P>
<P>
	   Those figures compared with an operating profit of $1.80 billion, or 68
cents per share, in the fourth quarter of 1998 -- including the performance of
the TCI cable operation and IBM Global Network, both of which AT&AMP;T was still in
the process of acquiring at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   Earnings per share declined even as total earnings rose because AT&AMP;T issued
billions of dollars worth of stock to pay for TCI and other purchases during the
year. So, by the end of 1999, there were 568 million more AT&AMP;T shares in
circulation compared with the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest results didn't reflect one-time charges of $496 million for
expenses such as upgrading AT&AMP;T's wireless network and severance pay for about
2,800 employees who lost their jobs or accepted a buyout during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourth-quarter revenues totaled $16.34 billion, an increase of 5.9 percent
from $15.42 billion in the same period in 1998, also adjusted to include the TCI
and IBM operations that had not yet been acquired.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's flagship long-distance calling business, the nation's biggest
by a wide margin, saw sales drop 4.5 percent in the fourth quarter as price wars
continued to eat away at revenues.
</P>
<P>
	   Notably, it was the first full quarter since the introduction of the "one
rate" plan charging seven cents per minute for long distance calls around the
clock.
</P>
<P>
	   At year end, there were about 500,000 subscribers to the new plan, one third
of whom had switched from other companies, and two-thirds of whose bills were
averaging at least $25 per month, the company said.
</P>
<P>
	   AT&AMP;T officials reiterated their view that long distance is just one aspect
of the new emphasis on bundled services, whether through cable or wireless -- or
even regular phone lines leased from rivals such as Bell Atlantic in New York,
where the company now has 150,000 customers buying both local and long-distance
service.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, AT&AMP;T's profit totaled $5.45 billion, or $1.74 per share,
down from $6.40 billion, or $2.37 a share, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year's operating profit amounted to $2.20 a share, down from $2.35 a
share in 1998, with both tallies adjusted to include a full year of results from
TCI and other operations acquired during 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Including the same adjustments, revenues for 1999 totaled $64.14 billion, an
increase of 6.2 percent from $60.39 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   In Tuesday at 5:15 EST on the New York Stock Exchange, AT&AMP;T was up 6 1/4
cents a share at $51.25.

<HEADLINE> FDIC Proposes Doubling Funding  </HEADLINE>
   By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., concerned about its
biggest losses from bank failures since the early 1990s, is proposing a doubling
of the capital requirements for banks that specialize in risky loans to people
with inferior credit histories.
</P>
<P>
	   Regulators have warned that the higher-interest loans, called subprime
loans, can increase the risk of defaults for the deposit insurance fund. They
played a role in some of the eight U.S. bank failures last year, which cost the
FDIC about $1 billion -- its biggest annual hit since the regional banking
crises of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   The failures, coming amid a booming economy, have worried regulators and
lawmakers. Compounding the concern, the FDIC is predicting that as many as 20
banks could go under this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Donna Tanoue, the FDIC chairwoman, floated the idea of increasing the
required capital for banks making higher-interest loans in a speech last year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe thrifts and banks with high concentrations of subprime loans
should be required to hold more capital than the current rules now dictate. A
lot more,'' Ms. Tanoue told bankers.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, the FDIC has circulated a draft to the other federal banking agencies,
including the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,
which must all agree on a formal proposal to be put out for public comment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We know that they have a proposal out there for discussion purposes,''
David Runkel, a spokesman for the House Banking Committee, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of snowstorm-related federal government closures in Washington,
spokesmen for the FDIC and other banking agencies couldn't be reached for
comment on the proposal. It was first reported in Tuesday's editions of The Wall
Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
	   There has been disagreement over the FDIC's proposed definition of subprime
borrowers, The Journal reported. Critics of the proposal have maintained that
under the definition -- borrowers who have made two payments 30 or more days
late or one payment 60 or more days late -- many community banks that lend to
low- and moderate-income people would be adversely affected.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDIC says it has found about 150 banks and thrifts with significantly
high levels of subprime loans. Together, those institutions hold about 5 percent
of total banking industry assets.
</P>
<P>
	   The Banking Committee chairman, Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, recently proposed
legislation that would give the head of the FDIC more authority over troubled
banks. His proposal was prompted by the failure last fall of First National Bank
of Keystone, a large bank based in Keystone, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
	   The estimated $750 million loss to the FDIC insurance fund caused by
Keystone's failure could make it one of the 10 most expensive ever in this
country. Federal regulators, who closed the bank in September, said they found
evidence of apparent fraud that resulted in the depletion of its capital.
</P>
<P>
	   Leach has said there are indications the regulators may not have properly
supervised Keystone when it engaged in risky financial strategies, and that the
FDIC was stymied at key points by other federal banking agencies in its desire
to examine the bank's activities.
</P>
<P>
	   Leach didn't immediately return a telephone call seeking comment Tuesday on
the FDIC's proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   The bank insurance fund, which backs each account up to $100,000, has an
adequate cushion -- now some $29 billion -- to cover depositors' losses.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Confidence Hits High  </HEADLINE>
    By SETH SUTEL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Consumer confidence, a driving force in the economy's long
expansion, has soared to its highest level in the 33 years the statistic has
been kept, driven by the booming stock market and plentiful jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   "Consumers have every reason to be optimistic. There is just nothing going
wrong," said economist Mark Zandi at Regional Financial Associates in West
Chester, Pa.
</P>
<P>
	   The Conference Board, which studies business and finance trends, reported
Tuesday that its Consumer Confidence Index rose to 144.7 in January, the highest
level reached since the business-financed group began keeping such records in
February 1967.
</P>
<P>
	   Wall Street analysts had only expected a reading of 141.5 in the index,
which is based on monthly interviews with 5,000 U.S. households and measures
consumer optimism about current and future business conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   Economists pay close attention to the index since consumer spending makes up
about two-thirds of the U.S. economy and is a major factor behind the current
U.S. growth streak, which is due next month to become the longest on record.
</P>
<P>
	   Zandi attributed the "euphoria" among consumers to a confluence of factors:
historically low levels of unemployment, a booming stock market, and low
inflation. "Until the stock market cools, confidence will not weaken and
consumers will not stop spending," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some economists caution, however, that the U.S. economy's heavy reliance on
consumer spending can be a mixed blessing since sentiment can be affected by
unforeseen factors such as political turmoil or sudden changes in economic
policies, like a tax increase.
</P>
<P>
	   "Any time you have an economy that is influenced so much by consumer
confidence you have to be on the lookout," said Gary R. Thayer, chief economist
at the A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. brokerage in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
	   "If there were unexpected world events, a sudden policy change, or an
aggressive rate raise by the Fed, then you could have problems," Thayer said.
</P>
<P>
	   One downside of the continued expansion is an inevitable rise in interest
rates. Bond yields have been creeping higher in recent months, and Federal
Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan has hinted that the Fed may raise interest rates
again at its meeting next week.
</P>
<P>
	   The cost of higher borrowing was evident in a separate report Tuesday that
showed a slight dip in existing home sales last month due to higher mortgage
rates.
</P>
<P>
	   Even with the 1.4 percent drop in December, sales of existing homes still
posted an impressive 4.6 percent gain for all of 1999, reaching a record 5.197
million, the National Association of Realtors reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The stock market slipped during the day on worries about higher interest
rates but bounced back in the afternoon with support from strong corporate
earnings reports. The Dow Jones industrial average, which plunged 243.54 on
Monday, was down almost 125 additional points during Tuesday's session. But it
finished with a gain of 21.72 points on the day at 11,029.89. Long-term bond
prices were slightly higher.
</P>
<P>
	   The Conference Board survey reported 47 percent of those responding rated
the current business environment "good" and 54 percent said jobs were
"plentiful."
</P>
<P>
	   The Conference Board's report also said that consumers' optimism about
future economic conditions is continuing to improve. The percentage of
respondents anticipating better business conditions over the next six months
rose to 19.6 percent from 17.5 percent last month. Those expecting conditions to
worsen fell to 3.3 percent from 4.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Conservatives Win a Round  </HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- Germany's conservatives got a rare respite in their slush
fund scandal Tuesday when prosecutors declined to look into alleged payoffs to
the party during a French-German business deal.
</P>
<P>
	   The Christian Democrats also fended off an opposition move to force new
elections in Hesse state, where millions in illegal campaign funds flowed while
Helmut Kohl was German chancellor and party leader.
</P>
<P>
	   While Kohl has said he solicited up to $1 million in covert cash
contributions during the 1990s, allegations that a ``French connection'' helped
finance his 1994 re-election bid could be much more explosive.
</P>
<P>
	   But the danger of a judicial probe receded Tuesday. The chief prosecutor in
Bonn, the former capital, said any alleged events would fall outside the
five-year statute of limitations on corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't see any reason to take action,'' prosecutor Bernd Koenig said.
</P>
<P>
	   A report by German and French television claimed last weekend that former
French President Francois Mitterrand arranged for payment of $15.7 million to
the Christian Democrats in 1992 to help his friend Kohl's campaign. A Kohl
spokesman has denied that.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said the money was part of $44 million in payoffs by France's Elf
Aquitaine for its 1992 purchase of a former East German refinery at Leuna.
</P>
<P>
	   Bonn prosecutors are already investigating possible criminal charges against
Kohl and two former aides, but that probe involves later illegal donations which
the former chancellor has admitted.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl also faced a renewed threat of legal steps by his own party over his
refusal to identify secret donors and help clear up the scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   Heiner Geissler, a senior party leader and longtime Kohl critic, said a
decision by the Christian Democrats on Monday to back off from legal action
against Kohl was not the final word.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We do not wish a court battle with Helmut Kohl, but this was a decision
only for the moment,'' Geissler said on West German Radio.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the scandal erupted last month, the Christian Democrats have produced
mounting evidence of irregularities in a system of secret accounts and cash
donations run by Kohl, who led Germany for 16 years until 1998 and headed the
party for a quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
	   Auditors have found more than $6.3 million from undetermined sources from
1989-1998 -- far greater than the amount Kohl admitted soliciting.
</P>
<P>
	   The figure, announced Monday, did not include $6.8 million the Hesse state
branch has admitted channeling through foreign accounts and declaring falsely.
</P>
<P>
	   An opposition motion to force a repeat of last year's election failed
Tuesday when the governing Christian Democrat-led alliance mobilized its slim
majority in the state legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   The motion by the Social Democrats and Greens in the state Wiesbaden, near
Frankfurt, argued that the illegal funding skewed the campaign and robbed them
of re-election in the state last year. The vote was 56-54.

<HEADLINE> Euro Slides To New Low  </HEADLINE>
    By BRUCE STANLEY AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Europe's single currency, the euro, slipped briefly to a new
low against the dollar Tuesday, with analysts citing the prospect of higher U.S.
interest rates as one of several factors in its renewed weakness.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro traded at 99.87 cents, below the 99.90 cents it hit on Dec. 3 when
it first slipped to parity with the dollar -- a psychologically significant if
economically meaningless threshold.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro bounced back later Tuesday to close in London at $1.0046. In
trading later in New York, it was at $1.0012.
</P>
<P>
	   "People got their fingers burned last year trying to guess when the euro had
bottomed out. There's a lot of reluctance to get back into it," said Sonja
Hellemann, a London-based currency analyst at the French bank Paribas.
</P>
<P>
	   The single currency has plunged 16 percent since its first day of trading,
Jan. 4, 1999, when it rose to an all-time high of $1.1886. It recovered somewhat
in late December and early January, but has subsequently resumed its slide.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, the euro fell to within a whisker of the dollar -- to $1.0001 --
after finance ministers and central bankers from the world's seven most
industrialized countries failed to express concern about the currency's weakness
during a weekend summit in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   Some analysts acknowledged confusion about the euro's latest slippage, which
has occurred in spite of recent weakness in U.S. equities markets and renewed
economic strength among countries that use the euro.
</P>
<P>
	   "Fundamentally, it's very hard to justify. I think it basically
psychological," said Lee Ferridge, chief currency strategist at Rabobank in
London.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday's weak performance by stock markets across Europe may have
undermined the beleaguered currency. Markets in London, Germany, Paris and Milan
all finished down more than 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "As soon as the Euroland markets opened down, the attractiveness of buying
the euro was effectively gone," said Neil Parker, a senior economist at the
Royal Bank of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
	   Ferridge and others said widespread expectations that the U.S. Federal
Reserve will raise interest rates next week were a key cause for the latest bout
of euro-phobia.
</P>
<P>
	   Higher U.S. interest rates would make assets priced in dollars a more
attractive investment than similar assets denominated in euros.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite a 7 percent drop in the Dow Jones industrial average over the last
several trading sessions, Chase Manhattan senior economist Adrian Schmidt noted
that continued strong growth in the U.S. economy and the need for European
companies to finance mergers and acquisitions there has attracted billions of
dollars in funds from euro-zone nations.
</P>
<P>
	   That money might otherwise have gone into investments at home and thereby
supported the euro.

<HEADLINE> Warring Sides in Congo Seek Peace  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Responding to African leaders' requests, the U.N.
Security Council was laying groundwork Tuesday for an eventual U.N. peacekeeping
force to shore up Congo's faltering cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
	   The gesture of support came after seven African heads of state -- including
major players in the regional war -- accused the Security Council of shirking
its responsibilities by delaying the deployment of peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
	   Congo's government, the country's rebels and the surrounding nations that
were drawn into the conflict signed a cease-fire accord last summer. The accord
envisioned U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
	   But the agreement has since teetered on the brink of collapse, with fighting
between the two sides in several parts of Congo. Meanwhile, the possibility of a
full-fledged peacekeeping mission has remained distant.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States has been seen as a major stumbling block to sending in
troops. But on Monday, it said it would support a peacekeeping force if all
sides begin consolidating peace.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, the current president of the Security
Council, told reporters Tuesday that a resolution now being drafted outlines
U.N. recommendations for an initial 5,500-man force, including 500 military
observers and 3,400 troops to protect them.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, there are 79 U.N. military liaison officers in Congo. Approval and
deployment of the observer mission could be weeks away, while authorization for
a full-fledged peacekeeping force is still in doubt.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Congress must approve any expansion of the current U.N. mission.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We think that yesterday's extraordinary meeting of the African presidents
illustrated both the fact that they all want to make progress, but that there
are serious problems, and that the U.N. has an important role to play there,''
Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
	   The war in Congo has drawn in a half-dozen African nations. Uganda and
Rwanda back the rebels who rose up in August 1998 to oust Congolese President
Laurent Kabila. Kabila, meanwhile, enlisted the support of Zimbabwe, Angola and
Namibia.
</P>
<P>
	   The war has destabilized the entire region, killing untold numbers of people
and uprooting close to 1 million from their homes.
</P>
<P>
	   Holbrooke invited leaders of the nations involved to New York this week to
renew their pledges to last summer's cease-fire agreement. The sides began talks
Monday. On Tuesday, they met in closed-door meetings to discuss details of
implementing the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
	   Kabila said Tuesday he still wants to make the peace process work. He said
the cease-fire agreement had failed thus far because it hadn't led to the
withdrawal of Rwandan and Ugandan troops from his country. The peace accord
calls for the full withdrawal of all foreign troops.
</P>
<P>
	   Rwanda and Uganda say they are supporting the Congolese rebels to protect
their own borders from attacks by Rwandan and Ugandan rebel groups based inside
Congo. Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu said Tuesday he was willing to
withdraw his troops ``even tomorrow'' as long as Rwandan Hutu militants in Congo
are permanently disarmed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't want them shooting us in our own backs,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Optimistic About Agenda  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, handicapping prospects for
congressional approval of his legislative agenda, said Tuesday there is ``some
significant chance'' for passage of an increase in the minimum wage, a patients'
bill of rights and tougher gun controls.
</P>
<P>
	   Beyond that, he said there is ``a better than 50-50 chance that a lot of the
investments I have proposed will eventually prevail.'' In particular, he
mentioned his proposal for $5 billion worth of tax incentives over 10 years to
encourage investment in depressed areas under a program he calls ``New
Markets.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president will outline his agenda at 9 p.m. Thursday night in his final
State of the Union address, presented before a joint session of Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Congress ignored the three initiatives that Clinton singled out
as having a significant chance for passing this year: background checks on
weapon sales at gun shows, an increase in the minimum wage beyond $5.15 an hour
and a patients' bill of rights to strengthen consumer protections in dealing
with managed care health insurance programs.
</P>
<P>
	   To drum up public interest about Clinton's speech, the White House created a
State of the Union Web site with a history of the presidential address, a
children's page and a place to send ideas to the president. The House Budget
Committee has created its own Web page of ``White House budget leaks'' tallying
the growing pricetag of Clinton's proposals. As of Tuesday, it said Clinton
would expand spending by $30.4 billion next year.
</P>
<P>
	   Going into his final year, Clinton said, ``I do feel some nostalgia. And I
think it's something I'm very much trying to fight off.'' He said it was
important to keep the attention focused on the future and to keep ``the energy
level very high.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president plans to propose a $110 billion expansion of health insurance
programs, a $10 billion expansion of the earned income tax credit for the
working poor, initiatives on education and gun enforcement and other areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite Clinton's lengthy agenda, Republican leaders of Congress say that an
election year does not leave a lot of time for big, new initiatives.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Arrested for War Crimes  </HEADLINE>
   By IRENA GAJIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VISEGRAD, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- NATO peacekeepers on Tuesday arrested a
suspected war criminal under a U.N. tribunal indictment charging him with
``extermination'' of Muslim men, women and children and other atrocities.
</P>
<P>
	   Visegrad Police Chief Vuceta Sipcic identified the arrested man as Mitar
Vasiljevic.
</P>
<P>
	   A statement from the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia in The
Hague, Netherlands, said Vasiljevic was suspected of ``participation in the mass
murder, torture and other cruel treatment of the Bosnian Muslim population,
including women, children and the elderly in and around Visegrad.''
</P>
<P>
	   The alleged crimes were committed between May 1992 and October 1994, said
the statement. It said Vasiljevic, 45, was charged with ``extermination ... of a
significant number of Bosnian Muslim civilians.''
</P>
<P>
	   Detailing one alleged crime, the indictment said that Vasiljevic
participated in forcing civilians into a house and then setting it on fire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some people tried to jump out of the windows, but the other member of the
paramilitary unit stood outside shooting at them while Mitar Vasiljevic (shone)
... a light on the victims,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   A statement issued in Brussels by NATO Secretary-General Lord Robertson said
Vasiljevic was being processed for transfer to the war crimes tribunal in The
Hague, Netherlands. It gave no details of where the arrest took place or which
troops took him into custody.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Vasiljevic was a member of the paramilitary unit 'White Eagles' operating
in the municipality of Visegrad and the surrounding area,'' the NATO statement
said. ``While a member of this unit, Mitar Vasiljevic is believed to have
committed serious crimes, including murder and inhumane treatment of Bosnian
Muslim and other non-Serb civilians.''
</P>
<P>
	   The statement said Tuesday's arrest, the third in two months, should ``serve
as a warning to those with guilty consciences. It's time to turn yourself in.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Sarajevo, a statement from the peacekeepers said Vasiljevic was
apprehended without casualties to NATO troops but left open whether anybody else
had been injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Visegrad, close to the Serbian border, is patrolled by French and German
members of the Bosnian peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bosnian Serb news agency, SRNA, said Vasiljevic had been a member of the
Bosnian Serb army during the war that started in 1992 with a Serb rebellion
against Bosnian independence and ended three years later with the Dayton treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   In another development, the top Muslim official in the Bosnian government on
Tuesday called for a revision of the Dayton treaty, arguing that the peace
agreement is based on the legalization of genocide -- and that is not being
implemented anyway.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Dayton Agreement is built on genocide, built on force,'' said Haris
Silajdzic, who shares the office of the Bosnian prime minister with a Serb. In
comments to reporters, he emphasized that he was expressing views as an
individual and not as the co-prime minister.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now we have public documents that prove that the international community
recognized ... that what happened in Bosnia was genocide,'' he said in reference
to three findings by the U.N. war crimes tribunal that genocide was part of the
1992-95 war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Silajdzic signed the 1995 agreement that stopped the war, he said
it remains controversial. Several key points of the agreement have yet to be
implemented, he said, such as returning refugees to their homes, drawing up a
common constitution, or recreating Bosnia's prewar multiethnic society,
particularly in the Bosnian Serb controlled half of the country.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dayton accord divided Bosnia into two entities -- a Bosnian Serb
republic and a Muslim-Croat Federation -- each with such powers that they seem
to act as independent states instead of two administrative regions of one
nation.

<HEADLINE> Consumers Affected by Fuel Costs  </HEADLINE>
    By DENISE LAVOIE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Alex Terentino feels like fuel suppliers have him
over a barrel -- twice over.
</P>
<P>
	   Terentino has seen the amount he pays for home heating oil go from 99 cents
a gallon to $1.89 a gallon in a matter of weeks, while his bill for natural gas
at his Stamford butcher shop has doubled in the last month.
</P>
<P>
	   "You've got no choice. You've got to pay," said Terentino, one of many
consumers across the country complaining about the sudden and rapid rise in fuel
costs.
</P>
<P>
	   With much of the Northeast gripped by frigid temperatures during the past
week, usage of home heating oil was way up, leading to supply shortages in some
areas.
</P>
<P>
	   In East Hartford, fire officials urged residents to lower their thermostats
to conserve fuel after a main supplier, Motiva Enterprices LLC, said it expects
to run out of oil by mid-week. Several residents in two town trailer parks went
without heat for two days when their fuel wasn't resupplied in time.
</P>
<P>
	   With supply decreasing, home heating oil prices have responded by rising
dramatically. In Connecticut, retail prices shot up at least 40 cents a gallon,
to between $1.70 and close to $2 per gallon. In Massachusetts, the average
retail price rose to $1.74 a gallon Monday, up 57 cents from a week ago and more
than double what it was this time last year. And in New Hampshire, retail prices
jumped 49 cents in six days, from $1.22 per gallon to $1.71.
</P>
<P>
	   Truckers are also feeling the pinch because of sharp increases in the costs
of diesel fuel. In New York, the retail price of diesel fuel rose from a low of
$1.349 per gallon to a high of $2.059 per gallon from Thursday to Monday,
according to the New York State Motor Truck Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Even kerosene users were seeing steep price increases. At French's Kwick
Stop, near Hegesvillle, West Virginia, kerosene prices have jumped from 99 cents
a gallon a week ago to $1.69.
</P>
<P>
	   "People are shocked. I've been here 30 years and that's the highest I've
seen it," said Donna French.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton, after being inundated with pleas for help from officials
in several states, on Tuesday directed an emergency release of home heating
assistance funds. The money was to go to Alaska and the Northeastern states
"which have experienced the greatest hardship."
</P>
<P>
	   "These funds will help keep more American families safe and warm, and we'll
get them out there just as quickly as we possibly can," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Industry analysts say the sudden price increases have been caused by several
factors, including the recent cold snap, OPEC's decision to extend existing
production cuts past an original March deadline and low petroleum supplies.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you look at global inventories, they are certainly at some of the lowest
they've been at in many years," said George Beranek, an analyst with Petroleum
Finance Co., a private consulting firm based in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
	   "The low inventories are the result of the decisions made by OPEC, however,"
he said. "It has not reached the stage where suppliers are not getting what they
need."
</P>
<P>
	   During the past year, as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries has reduced production, prices of oil and gas have skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, winter was warmer than normal, and heating oil prices remained
stable and in some cases, dropped slightly during the season. Wholesale prices
for heating oil for delivery the following month traded on the New York
Mercantile Exchange were hovering around 32 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, heating oil for February delivery closed at 90.38 cents a
gallon, off a high last week of 93.50 cents.
</P>
<P>
	   While some people accepted the supply-and-demand theory, others suggested
there is some price-gouging going on. As a result, officials in several states
are investigating the higher prices.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have clear indications that there are surcharges on bills, nondelivery
of product, possible anti-competitive actions and lack of required notices of
shortages -- all of which may show violations of law," said Connecticut Attorney
General Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas Prescott, of Johnny Prescott and Son Oil Co. in Concord, N.H., said
any so-called shortage is one created to make money.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no war in the Mideast, no refineries are down, there is no major
explosion in the market," he said. "It is a normal winter in terms of degree
days, and a cold snap of six to eight days should not force prices up one
nickel."

<HEADLINE> Drifter Says He Killed 10 in Brazil  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL ASTOR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- A drifter charged with sexual abuse and
murder in Sao Paulo state has confessed to killing at least 10 children over a
20-year period, police said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Larete Patrocinio Orpinelli, 47, a drifter with a long history of violent
behavior, confessed to three murders shortly after he was arrested on Jan. 14 in
Rio Claro, police chief Sueli Isler Batelochi said. In subsequent days, he
confessed to seven more killings and led police to the bodies.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said the victims, both boys and girls, ranged in age from five to 11.
It was unclear exactly when each victim was killed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He said nightmares he was having made him to confess to the crimes,''
Batelochi said by telephone from Rio Claro, 250 miles west of Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
	   Orpinelli, who earned a modest living greasing the runners of the steel
doors on bars and restaurants, had been committed to psychiatric hospitals five
times between 1967 and 1993. He said he was driven to kill the children after he
was unable to perform sexually.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I got angry when I was not able to have sex,'' Orpinelli told police in
his initial confession after he was arrested for two of the killings. ``So I hit
them and strangled them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Police said he generally smashed his victim's teeth, sexually abused them
and then either strangled or beat them to death. He would often cover the bodies
with branches from Eucalyptus trees -- apparently believing the smell of would
disguise the odor of the corpse, Batelochi said.
</P>
<P>
	   She said she believes the actual number of victims could run much higher.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 99 children between the ages of two and 12 are reported to have
disappeared from towns in Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul states,
where Orpinelli is believed to have traveled. Papers found with Orpinelli
detailing his whereabouts over several years are being studied to see if he can
be linked with other crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   Orpinelli was arrested in 1996 for attacking two children. At the time,
police found him carrying gum, candies and toys. He was eventually released for
lack of evidence.

    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks that have been moving substantially or trading
heavily today on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney reported earnings per share of 25 cents in its fiscal first quarter,
beating analysts' estimate of 20 cents due to strong results from the ABC
broadcast group. Merrill Lynch, Salomon Smith Barney and Goldman Sachs all
raised their ratings on the stock.
</P>
<P>
	   The company reported earnings of 51 cents a share, compared with Wall Street
expectations of 47 cents a share. Texas Instruments cited heavy demand for chips
used in wireless communications devices.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said it earned 21 cents per share in its fiscal third quarter,
well below analysts' forecast of 30 cents per share. McKesson officials said
they don't anticipate a meaningful rebound in software sales until late this
year.
</P>
<P>
	   The company earned 63 cents per share in its fourth quarter, up from 49
cents in the fourth quarter of 1998. Waters' businesses including liquid
chromatography and thermal analysis help develop new drugs, break down the
nutritional content of foods and test air and water quality.
</P>
<P>
	   The company met earnings expectations for the fourth quarter, but warned
that results for the first quarter of 2000 will suffer as the company spends
heavily on sales and marketing of new products. Tellabs makes equipment that
manages traffic on telephone networks.
</P>
<P>
	   The company expects to report fourth-quarter earnings of 20 to 22 cents a
share, below analysts' estimates of 37 cents per shares. Sykes said several
major customer contracts that were expected to be completed in the fourth
quarter were not formally executed.
</P>
<P>
	   The company earned 17 cents per share in its fiscal third quarter, down from
22 cents per share in the third quarter of 1998. PSS, a distributor of medical
products, said problems with suppliers hurt its revenues in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The company will be added to the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index on Friday.
Companies added to the index often get a boost as fund managers who try to

	   Stocks End Mostly Up; Dow Up 21.72
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks ended a highly volatile session mostly
higher today as investors rewarded companies that posted strong
earnings reports for the final quarter of 1999. But market averages
pitched wildly as the threat of rising interest rates convinced
many investors that corporate profits may be pinched later this
year. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 21.72 to close at
11,029.89. The blue-chip index dropped as much as 124.72 points
earlier in the session and had appeared to be on track for its
sixth consecutive decline. Broader stock indicators also bounced
back from major losses to finish higher. The Nasdaq composite index
rose 71.34 to 4,167.42.

	   Sales of Existing Homes Up 4.6 Percent
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sales of existing homes soared 4.6 percent in
1999 to a record 5.197 million as Americans feeling prosperous and
with money to spend snapped up homes despite rising mortgage rates.
Sales surpassed the previous record of 4.97 million set in 1998,
the National Association of Realtors said today. In December,
however, sales fell 1.4 percent from the month before to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.06 million units. Economists
read the December decline as a sign that rising mortgage rates have
begun to dampen demand.

	   Consumer Confidence Hits High
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A booming stock market and plentiful jobs pushed
consumer confidence, a driving force in the economy's long
expansion, to the highest level ever recorded by a private research
group that has been tracking the data for more than 32 years.
``Consumers have every reason to be optimistic. There is just
nothing going wrong,'' said economist Mark Zandi at Regional
Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa. The Conference Board,
which studies business and finance trends, reported today that its
Consumer Confidence Index rose to 144.7, a new high, in January,
Wall Street analysts had expected a reading of only 141.5.
</P>

</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The booming stock market allowed Merrill Lynch &AMP;
Co., the largest brokerage firm in the United States, to double its
fourth-quarter earnings from a year ago. The New York-based company
today reported earnings of $764 million, easily beating analysts'
expectations. The company's profits represent earnings of $1.80 a
share, well above the $1.39 a share analysts had predicted,
according to First Call Corp. In the fourth quarter of 1998,
Merrill Lynch reported profits of $359 million, or 86 cents a
share. Merrill Lynch stock was up 5 at 80 11/16.

	   Raytheon's Earnings Drop 79 Percent
</P>
<P>
	   LEXINGTON, Mass. (AP) -- Raytheon Co. said today its
fourth-quarter earnings plunged 79 percent, a drop larger than Wall
Street analysts had projected for the defense contractor. The
company blamed a decline in revenue on lower missile shipments as
well as aircraft production delays and accounting changes mandated
by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Net income was $72
million, or 21 cents a share, in the October-December period, down
from $341 million, or $1 per share, a year earlier. Analysts
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had predicted earnings of
22 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Exxon Mobil Earnings Rise 34 Percent
</P>
<P>
	   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Higher oil prices helped push Exxon Mobil
Corp.'s fourth-quarter earnings up nearly 34 percent and ahead of
Wall Street expectations. The oil company said today its net
operating income was $2.71 billion, or 77 cents a share, 2 cents
better than the 75 cents expected by analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thomson Financial. Earnings a year earlier were $2.03 billion,
or 58 cents a share. Including expenses related to last year's
merger between Exxon and Mobil, net income was $2.28 billion, or 65
cents a share, compared with $1.38 billion, or 39 cents a share in
the final quarter of 1998. Fourth-quarter revenue increased 30
percent to $55.96 billion from $43.14 billion. On Wall Street
today, Exxon's price was down 3/16 to 84 1/16.

<P>
	   Xerox Profits Fall 52 Percent
</P>
<P>
	   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Xerox Corp. reported today that its
profits fell 52 percent in the fourth quarter as it struggled with
increased competition and sales that were diminished by Y2K
anxiety. The company said it was pursuing cost-cutting steps but
did not say what they might be. Net income in the October-December
period was $294 million, or 41 cents per share, compared with $615
million, or 84 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by
First Call/Thomson Financial had expected earnings of 40 cents.
Revenues in the quarter fell 6 percent to $5.44 billion from $5.79
billion a year ago. On Wall Street today, Xerox's price was up 3/16
to 21 15/16.

<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- American Home Products Corp., in the midst of a

earnings rose 1 percent, well below the pharmaceutical industry's
double-digit average. The performance matched analysts'
expectations. Johnson &AMP; Johnson said its fourth-quarter profit
jumped 12 percent excluding unusual charges, exceeding Wall Street
forecasts by a cent. American Home Products said it earned $593.2
million or 45 cents per share in the fourth quarter, compared to
$590.1 million or 44 cents per share in the same period a year ago.
The year-ago figures reflect a $240.5 million restructuring charge.
Johnson &AMP; Johnson said that excluding special charges it had a
fourth-quarter profit of $796 million or 56 cents per share,
compared to $712 million or 50 cents a share a year ago.

	   Venator To Cut 3,700 Jobs

<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Venator Group Inc., formerly Woolworth, will
slash 3,700 jobs and close 358 stores, the its latest move to
restructure its business in an attempt to boost sales and profits.
It already, over the past few years, has closed thousands of stores
and sold off many of its noncore businesses so that it could focus
its efforts on its sporting goods divisions. Venator operates more
than 4,000 stores, mostly under the Foot Locker and Champs Sports
name. The retailer announced today that it would cut about 30
percent of its sales and corporate staff. That includes about 600
corporate staffers and 3,100 people who work in its stores. About
20 percent of the job cuts will be in Canada, and the rest will be
from its U.S. operations.

	   European Stocks Close Lower
</P>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Losses on Wall Street and fears of an interest

points to 398.92. The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 606 shares in
European companies fell 6.27 points to 360.18. The Dow Jones Stoxx
50 Index fell 71.7 points to 4477.0. In domestic markets, London's

Frankfurt's Xetra DAX Index fell 1.8 percent to 6,809.6. Among
decliners were Bayerische HypoVereinsbank, which closed down 6.4
percent on fears that the company could cut dividends and post weak
earnings for 1999. InP Paris, the CAC-40 Index ended down 1.6
percent to 5,597.50. Milan's MIB30 Index was down 2.2 percent to

<HEADLINE> Future Uncertain for Uranium Plants  </HEADLINE>
   By NANCY ZUCKERBROD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The company that owns and operates the nation's only two
uranium enrichment plants is considering cutting jobs and closing one of the
facilities, a spokeswoman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Falling prices for enriched uranium, used to fuel nuclear power plants, and
increased production costs prompted directors of U.S. Enrichment Corp. to
discuss cost-cutting options at a meeting Tuesday at an undisclosed
Washington-area location.
</P>
<P>
	   Issues on the table included possible layoffs or the eventual closing of a
gaseous diffusion plant, either in Paducah, Ky., or in Portsmouth, Ohio, USEC
spokeswoman Elizabeth Stuckle said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Neither of those decisions have been made as of yet,'' she said, adding
the directors plan to meet again next week.
</P>
<P>
	   Bethesda, Md.-based USEC was a government entity created to enrich uranium
for commercial nuclear plants. It was privatized in 1998 to better compete in a
global market.
</P>
<P>
	   USEC officials say while the company is profitable, it is losing money on a
contract to sell enriched uranium from Russia to utility companies worldwide.
The deal was set up by the U.S. government to keep Soviet-era warhead uranium
away from rogue nations and terrorists.
</P>
<P>
	   USEC asked the federal government in December to compensate the company for
up to $200 million lost on the Russian deal, but the government declined.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our industry is paying for world peace,'' said Dan Minter, president of
the Piketon, Ohio, chapter of the Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy
Workers International Union, which represents Portsmouth plant workers.
</P>
<P>
	   USEC employs about 2,100 people in Portsmouth and 1,700 in Paducah. The
company laid off 250 workers at each plant last year. Any additional layoffs
also would be divided between the two plants, Stuckle said.
</P>
<P>
	   Minter said employees did not know the board was considering layoffs or a
plant closing. He said the union is adopting a wait-and-see attitude.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't want to plan for the funerals until we have to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Miller, a Washington policy analyst for the workers' union, said the
layoffs or a plant closure would be devastating to both communities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It may be time for the government to reevaluate whether it should buy USEC
back,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
	   The House Commerce Committee has been investigating a variety of issues
stemming from the privatization of USEC. Chairman J. Thomas Bliley Jr., R-Va.,
has said he would schedule hearings early this year, but no date has been set.

<HEADLINE> SBC Communications Profits Grow  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Fourth-quarter profits grew 8.2 percent at SBC
Communications, the nation's largest local phone company, fueled by more strong
demand for data and wireless services and by international investments.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding one-time factors, SBC earned $1.85 billion or 54 cents per share
in the three-month period, meeting most forecasts among Wall Street analysts
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. In the fourth quarter of 1998, the
company posted an operating profit of $1.71 billion, or 50 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   But despite the solid showing, SBC's share fell $2.12 1/2 per share to
$39.87 1/2 in Tuesday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest results don't reflect a one-time gain of $1.38 billion from the
sale of wireless operations to satisfy anti-competitive concerns in the purchase
of Ameritech, the Baby Bell serving the Midwest. Also excluded were expenses of
$574 million related to the merger and other one-time gains.
</P>
<P>
	   With all those items factored in, SBC had fourth-quarter net income of $3.11
billion, or 90 cents a diluted share. In the final three months of 1998, net
profits totaled $1.53 billion, or 44 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourth-quarter revenue rose to $12.90 billion compared with $12.17 billion a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Edward E. Whitacre Jr., chairman and chief executive officer, said SBC got
off to a fast start during the quarter with Project Pronto, the company's $6
billion plan to accelerate the rollout of high-speed Internet access to more
than 80 percent of its local telephone customers by the end of 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are moving closer to our goal of becoming the only communications
company our customers will ever need," Whitacre said. SBC recently applied for
regulatory approval to sell long distance in Texas and plans to seek clearance
for California in the near future.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, operating profits increased to $7.44 billion, or $2.15 per
share, on revenues of $49.49 billion. That compares with 1998's tally of $6.61
billion, or $1.92 per share, on revenues of $46.21 billion.

	   TRAVEL COSTS: Business travelers are walking around with lighter pockets
these days. In cities like Boston, New York and Orlando, Fla., travel rates have
more than doubled since 1986, according to an analysis by Ruzenheimer
International.
</P>
<P>
	   The management consulting firm found that the business traveler in Boston
could eat three first-class meals and lodge overnight at a fancy hotel for $142
in 1986, but by 1999 that figure had more than doubled to $313.
</P>
<P>
	   The Big Apple remains the most expensive. An overnight stay averaged $403
last year, including meals, compared to $204 back then. In Orlando, costs
ballooned from $86 to $175.
</P>
<P>
	   Rolfe Shellenberger, senior travel consultant at the Rochester, Wis.-based
Ruzenheimer, suggests travelers stay at or near airport hotels to trim costs and
either rent a car or use public transportation, as an alternative to taxis.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   STARTING EARLY: Younger people are actively investing in their future. A new
study by the Investment Company Institute and the Employee Benefit Research
Institute found many 401(K) participants are approaching retirement age with
substantial funds.
</P>
<P>
	   While the average 401(K) asset allocations vary with the participant's age,
younger participants were likely to follow the footsteps of those before them,
favoring equity funds at first and investing in guaranteed investment contracts
and bond funds later.
</P>
<P>
	   On average, those in their 20s invested more than half their assets (62.1
percent) in equity funds, 4.7 percent in GICs and 4.7 percent in bond funds. By
comparison, people in their sixties invested 39.8 percent of their assets in
equities, 20.6 percent in GICs and 9 percent in bonds.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   CUT CALL COSTS: If your monthly phone bill has towering numbers, you might
be on the wrong calling plan, warns Consumer Reports.
</P>
<P>
	   To cut costs, the magazine suggests you first identify how much you really
use the phone. If your calls are brief and infrequent, you can get by on the
bare-bones service offered in your area. But if you chat often, have multiple
lines and carry a cell phone, you're better off looking for a provider with a
package deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Shop around. Look for local and long distance service providers that offer
discounted rates or unlimited calls for a set price. Don't pay for services you
don't need. If you have a calling card beware of hidden surcharges. And, above
all, check your bill for flaws.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Eyes Debt Payment by 2013  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Virtually doubling the size of the budget battlefield
this election year, the Congressional Budget Office said Tuesday that it now
expects federal surpluses over the next decade to total as much as a gigantic
$1.9 trillion.
</P>
<P>
	   With the soaring economy pouring billions in unforeseen revenue into federal
coffers, President Clinton said he will propose paying off the government's
entire $3.6 trillion federally held debt by 2013. That would be two years
earlier than he has previously aimed for, and puts him a step ahead of House
Republicans, who are working on a plan to pay off that portion of the debt by
2015.
</P>
<P>
	   The surplus estimate by CBO, for the 10 years ending 2010, represents a near
doubling of a $1 trillion forecast it issued only last July. The figures exclude
Social Security funds.
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides immediately claimed credit for the good news.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We got here by making hard choices and sticking to a strategy that works,
that builds opportunity and reinforces responsibility,'' Clinton said at the
White House. ``I remain committed to that strategy. I ask the Republican
majority in Congress to put politics aside and join me.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a written statement, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said, ``We
have this surplus because of the hard work of the American people, because of
the healthy American economy and because of prudent fiscal policies championed
by the Republican Congress.''
</P>
<P>
	   The ballooning surplus estimates by CBO, Congress' nonpartisan budget
analyst, mean there will be even more money at stake this election year as both
parties' presidential candidates, as well as Clinton and Congress, battle over
how much of it to use for possible tax cuts, spending increases and debt
reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the politicians for whom the forecast was good news is GOP
presidential contender George W. Bush, who has proposed a five-year, $483
billion tax cut that could be paid for by the new numbers. Some, including
Republican candidate Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., have said Bush's plan eats up
too much of the projected surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of likely political gridlock on issues this year, many analysts
expect that most of the surplus for fiscal 2001 -- which begins next Oct. 1 --
will go for debt reduction. CBO projected next year's surplus at up to $69
billion, plus another $166 billion in Social Security surpluses.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton provided no details about how he would eliminate the publicly held
debt, which is money the government owes investors who hold Treasury bonds,
bills and notes. The remaining $2 trillion of the $5.7 trillion national debt is
money held by the Social Security and other trust funds.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said his plan, to be included in the fiscal 2001 budget he releases
Feb. 7, will devote interest savings to Social Security, extending its solvency
beyond 2050. It will also seek to ensure Medicare's survival until at least
2025, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Taking a swipe at Republicans, the president said the national debt is $1.7
trillion less this year than was projected when he took office in 1993, despite
``repeated efforts to push us off the path of fiscal discipline with large and
irresponsible tax cuts.''
</P>
<P>
	   But GOP lawmakers scoffed at his plan, noting that he has already revealed
dozens of budget proposals that will cost tens of billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you're spiritual, it seems kind of miraculous'' that he can eliminate
the debt and boost spending, said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete
Domenici, R-N.M. ``If you're not, it sounds kind of magic.''
</P>
<P>
	   The new CBO figures were greeted with proclamations of victory by
Republicans, who had promised to not touch Social Security funds when they
finished writing this year's spending bills in the fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Though final figures for fiscal 2000 won't be known until Sept. 30, CBO
projected that there will be a $23 billion surplus this year without using
Social Security's own hefty surpluses.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional Democrats, however, said CBO's $1.9 trillion, 10-year surplus
estimates were unrealistic, because they assume that spending will be far lower
than is likely to actually occur.
</P>
<P>
	   Highlighting the political pressure it faced from both parties, CBO issued
three surplus forecasts, an unusual step for the agency. Two were for 10-year
surpluses of about $1.9 trillion, the other estimated $838 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats said the lower forecast was most accurate because it assumes
spending will grow enough to keep up with inflation every year for the one-third
of the $1.7 trillion budget Congress must approve annually. Those programs --
which include everything but automatically paid benefits like Social Security --
have grown at roughly that rate in recent years.
</P>
<P>
	   CBO projected a 10-year, $1.92 trillion surplus if spending limits
controlling that one-third of the budget are obeyed. They have been ignored the
last two years and are certain to be ignored again this year.
</P>
<P>
	   CBO also forecasts a $1.86 trillion, 10-year surplus if the approximately
$600 billion controlled by the spending limits is kept roughly the same for the
entire decade. Republicans are leaning toward using something like this
estimate.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Arrested for War Crimes  </HEADLINE>
   By IRENA GAJIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VISEGRAD, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- NATO peacekeepers on Tuesday arrested a
suspected war criminal under a U.N. tribunal indictment charging him with
``extermination'' of Muslim men, women and children and other atrocities.
</P>
<P>
	   Visegrad Police Chief Vuceta Sipcic identified the arrested man as Mitar
Vasiljevic.
</P>
<P>
	   A statement from the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia in The
Hague, Netherlands, said Vasiljevic was suspected of ``participation in the mass
murder, torture and other cruel treatment of the Bosnian Muslim population,
including women, children and the elderly in and around Visegrad.''
</P>
<P>
	   The alleged crimes were committed between May 1992 and October 1994, said
the statement. It said Vasiljevic, 45, was charged with ``extermination ... of a
significant number of Bosnian Muslim civilians.''
</P>
<P>
	   Detailing one alleged crime, the indictment said that Vasiljevic
participated in forcing civilians into a house and then setting it on fire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some people tried to jump out of the windows, but the other member of the
paramilitary unit stood outside shooting at them while Mitar Vasiljevic (shone)
... a light on the victims,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   A statement issued in Brussels by NATO Secretary-General Lord Robertson said
Vasiljevic was being processed for transfer to the war crimes tribunal in The
Hague, Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
	   In Paris, the French Defense Ministry said that French soldiers made the
arrest, but offered few details.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The prisoner was then turned over to representatives of the tribunal in
Sarajevo'' so he could be presented to the International court, a Defense
Ministry statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Vasiljevic was a member of the paramilitary unit 'White Eagles' operating
in the municipality of Visegrad and the surrounding area,'' the NATO statement
said. ``While a member of this unit, Mitar Vasiljevic is believed to have
committed serious crimes, including murder and inhumane treatment of Bosnian
Muslim and other non-Serb civilians.''
</P>
<P>
	   The statement said Tuesday's arrest, the third in two months, should ``serve
as a warning to those with guilty consciences. It's time to turn yourself in.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Sarajevo, a statement from the peacekeepers said Vasiljevic was
apprehended without casualties to NATO troops but left open whether anybody else
had been injured.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bosnian Serb news agency, SRNA, said Vasiljevic had been a member of the
Bosnian Serb army during the war that started in 1992 with a Serb rebellion
against Bosnian independence and ended three years later with the Dayton treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   In another development, the top Muslim official in the Bosnian government on
Tuesday called for a revision of the Dayton treaty, arguing that the peace
agreement is based on the legalization of genocide -- and that is not being
implemented anyway.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Dayton Agreement is built on genocide, built on force,'' said Haris
Silajdzic, who shares the office of the Bosnian prime minister with a Serb. In
comments to reporters, he emphasized that he was expressing views as an
individual and not as the co-prime minister.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now we have public documents that prove that the international community
recognized ... that what happened in Bosnia was genocide,'' he said in reference
to three findings by the U.N. war crimes tribunal that genocide was part of the
1992-95 war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Silajdzic signed the 1995 agreement that stopped the war, he said
it remains controversial. Several key points of the agreement have yet to be
implemented, he said, such as returning refugees to their homes, drawing up a
common constitution, or recreating Bosnia's prewar multiethnic society,
particularly in the Bosnian Serb controlled half of the country.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dayton accord divided Bosnia into two entities -- a Bosnian Serb
republic and a Muslim-Croat Federation -- each with such powers that they seem
to act as independent states instead of two administrative regions of one
nation.

<HEADLINE> Advertisers Drawn To Super Bowl  </HEADLINE>
    By SKIP WOLLENBERG AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Tennessee Titans and the St. Louis Rams won't be the
only fresh names trying to score some points in this Sunday's Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   About a dozen Internet companies are forking over the highest prices ever
paid for TV commercials so they can join regulars like Anheuser-Busch,
Pepsi-Cola and FedEx on the NFL championship game broadcast.
</P>
<P>
	   There were only two dot-coms in last year's game -- three if you count
lingerie marketer Victoria's Secret which advertised its fashion show Webcast.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some companies are out there on hope and a prayer, but it's part of the new
economy," said Jeffrey Taylor, chief executive of online job site Monster.com,
one of the Internet advertisers in the 1999 game.
</P>
<P>
	   Monster and a rival employment site, Hotjobs.com, each said that visits to
their sites soared after last year's Super Bowl exposure, and both are back.
Their experience fired the hopes of several of this year's young Internet
entrants.
</P>
<P>
	   Among them are information provider Britannica.com; the job site Kforce.com;
and women's Web site Oxygen.com.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC officials say the Internet companies helped push the commercial price to
an average of $2.2 million -- an astounding $73,333 per second -- for 61
half-minute commercials in the game. The top price for an ad was said to be over
$3 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The average is a whopping 38 percent more than the previous record $1.6
million that the Fox network claimed for ads in last year's Super Bowl. The
price went up even though the average audience rating tumbled 9 percent last
year to the lowest level since 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   The attraction is that the Super Bowl delivers the year's highest TV ratings
and audiences in the 120 million to 130 million range.
</P>
<P>
	   Anheuser-Busch, brewer of Budweiser, is the single biggest Super Bowl
advertiser with five minutes of commercial time in the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Its ads include one designed to tug on your heart strings by showing the
birth of a new Clydesdale horse and another with former hockey star Wayne
Gretzky driving a tipsy friend home from a bar -- on a Zamboni machine.
</P>
<P>
	   Pepsi-Cola will pitch its hot-selling Mountain Dew. One ad shows a bike
rider chasing a cheetah across African plains, capturing and reaching inside the
cat to retrieve a stolen can of Dew.
</P>
<P>
	   FedEx inserts a delivery truck into clips from the classic "Wizard of Oz"
movie to show it reaches "places other shipping companies can only imagine."
</P>
<P>
	   Pets.com's ad features its sock puppet singing "Don't Go" in a plea to
owners to spend more time with their pets by using the Web retailer for pet
supplies. Hotjobs.com shows its new computer hand icon driving a hard bargain in
a job interview while Tropicana pitches orange juice as "the best 9.3 seconds
you can possibly spend on yourself."
</P>
<P>
	   The World Wrestling Federation and Seven-Up each had ads rejected by the ABC
standards office, but came up with alternatives. The WWF, which won't specify
what ABC found objectionable, says its new ad shows "the unabashed excitement of
WWF fans in unexpected places." Seven-Up's original ad got thrown out because it
contained an off-color phrase. Its new one may not be much better. It shows a
fictional marketing executive exhorting consumers to "show us your cans."
</P>
<P>
	   The dot-coms include the well-established like E-Trade with $700 million in
revenue last year. Others are startups that are using investors' money for their
ads because they haven't yet generated enough revenue to pay the bill. They
include the wedding stationery supplier OurBeginning.com., technology adviser
Computer.com and financial portal OnMoney.
</P>
<P>
	   August Busch IV, head of marketing for Anheuser-Busch, says anticipation of
these expensive bids for recognition could ultimately benefit established brands
like his Budweiser.
</P>
<P>
	   "It heightens consumers' interest in the 'other game' being played along
with the Big Game," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some media buyers say the two small-market teams in this year's game could
lead to lower ratings since neither has a national following.
</P>
<P>
	   But others say the Super Bowl will attract a big audience no matter who is
in it -- and that a close game is the key to retaining viewers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Virtually the whole country comes to a standstill when the Super Bowl comes
on," said veteran commercial buyer Bill Croasdale of Western Initiative Media.
</P>
<P>
	   The Super Bowl is also an advertising showcase and viewers know it. Eight
percent of those watching Sunday's game will be tuning in just to see the ads,
researcher Eisner Communications found.

<HEADLINE> Euro Sets New Low Vs. Dollar  </HEADLINE>
    By PETER ALAN HARPER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The euro hit its lowest point yet against the dollar
Tuesday as investors decided the financial managers of the currency of 11
nations weren't worried about its weakness.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar also rose marginally against the yen as the Japanese currency
"got caught up in the slipstream of the dollar's advance against the euro," said
David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics in Essex, Conn.
</P>
<P>
	   In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0012, down from $1.0049
Monday. During the European trading day, the euro fell to 99.87 cents, below the
99.90 cents it hit on Dec. 3 when the euro first fell below $1.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar was quoted at 105.89 Japanese yen, up from 105.68.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro has fallen steadily since its introduction a year ago January at
$1.1668. Most of the currencies it replaces, including the German mark and the
French franc, are hovering at 10-year lows.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the weekend, finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrialized
nations failed to mention the currency at all at the end of their meeting in
Tokyo, giving traders the continued go-ahead to sell off the euro.
</P>
<P>
	   "The market still senses that European central bankers and finance ministers
have a benign-neglect policy today for the euro," Gilmore said.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar also was quoted at 1.6069 Swiss francs, up from 1.6044, and
1.4370 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4426. The British pound fell to $1.6460
from $1.6499.
</P>
<P>
	   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no longer
traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. Based on the euro's
rate, the dollar was worth: 1.9524 German marks, up from 1.9461; 6.5481 French
francs, up from 6.5269; and 1,932.89 Italian lire, up from 1.926.64.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Dissidents Held Before Meeting  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Police detained two of Cuba's best-known opposition leaders
Tuesday morning, hours before they were to hold a meeting of dissidents, a
leading human rights activist said.
</P>
<P>
	   Oswaldo Paya Sardinas and Hector Palacios were taken from their homes at
around 6 a.m., said Elizardo Sanchez, president of the Cuban Commission of Human
Rights and Reconciliation. Sanchez said he had been among those invited to a
meeting of 20 dissident figures scheduled for that afternoon at Palacios' home.
</P>
<P>
	   Palacios' wife, Gisela Delgado, was detained several hours after her
husband, Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
	   Paya is leader of the Christian Liberation Movement in Cuba. Palacios
founded the Democratic Solidarity Party and oversees a study center for the
opposition movements on the island.
</P>
<P>
	   Both have earned international recognition. They met with visiting Illinois
Gov. George Ryan in October and with Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar
when he traveled to Cuba for the Ibero-American summit in November.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are hoping that this is a short-term detention,'' said Sanchez, who
also ranks among the island's best-known opposition figures.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuba's communist government refers to dissidents as
``counterrevolutionaries'' and generally does not comment on such detentions.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Alejandro Gonzalez, among the few government
officials authorized to respond to press inquiries, did not answer phone calls
to his office Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanchez said he believes Cuba's communist leadership is taking advantage of
interest in the international custody dispute involving 6-year-old Elian
Gonzalez to crack down on opponents.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that the government is using its political success in that case to
neutralize the opposition, which really is quite small,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanchez himself spent many years in Cuban prisons. His commission issues a
report on civil rights every six months along with a list of people it considers
to be imprisoned for political reasons.
</P>
<P>
	   In a report earlier this month, Sanchez's organization listed 344 people it
said were fined, arrested or imprisoned for political reasons during the last
half of 1999, up from 324 during the first half. About 20 percent of those
people could be classified as prisoners of conscience under criteria established
by international human rights groups, Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cuban government says it holds no political prisoners, only common
criminals.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Head Denounces Military  </HEADLINE>
   By GONZALO SOLANO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Ecuador's new president declared Tuesday that his
government is not under the sway of military officers who toppled his
predecessor and put him in charge of this troubled Andean nation.
</P>
<P>
	   Gustavo Noboa, who was Ecuador's vice president until President Jamil Mahuad
was removed last week, said on television Tuesday that he was not beholden to
the military generals who put him in power.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Absolutely not,'' he said. ``I am here because I am fulfilling a duty that
I will carry out well.''
</P>
<P>
	   Noboa took office Saturday after Mahuad was forced out in a step the
military said was taken to avoid ``a social explosion'' after hundreds of
Indians and young military officers stormed the Congress building and declared a
new government.
</P>
<P>
	   However, some military experts and the former defense minister say the
generals who handed Noboa the presidency did so under pressure from Washington
and more than 20 regional commanders who rejected the overthrow of civilian
rule.
</P>
<P>
	   Armed forces chief Gen. Carlos Mendoza, who briefly took a place in the
junta before turning power over to Noboa, said he agreed to join the coup as a
stall tactic until democratic order could be restored.
</P>
<P>
	   He resigned his post and Gen. Telmo Sandoval took over as military
commander.
</P>
<P>
	   But Jose Gallardo, who had served as Mahuad's defense minister until a week
before the coup, said Mendoza and Sandoval knew of the plans by junior officers
to support the Indian protests and tried to take advantage of the situation to
seize power.
</P>
<P>
	   Gallardo, a retired army general, said the first thing that Noboa should do
is replace Sandoval, whom he described as politically ambitious ``and not to be
trusted.''
</P>
<P>
	   The new government must still confront Ecuador's worst economic crisis in
decades.
</P>
<P>
	   Inflation topped 60 percent last year, the highest in Latin America, and the
economy contracted 7.5 percent. Only one in three in the labor force has a
full-time job and 7 million of Ecuador's 12 million people are trapped in
poverty.
</P>
<P>
	   Another challenge will be combating rampant corruption and restoring trust
in politicians, many of whom seek public office for personal gain and have
little interest in improving the lives of the poor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I implore the nation's political class, please, for the first time in many
years, let us move forward together,'' Noboa said. ``The country deserves it.''

<HEADLINE> INS Orders Neutral Elian Meeting  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's Florida relatives must make the boy
available for a meeting with his Cuban grandmothers Wednesday at a neutral site,
the Justice Department ruled Tuesday. The grandmothers pressed their insistence
for the boy's return and pleaded with Congress not to force U.S. citizenship
upon him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He is only a 6-year-old boy. And he's a Cuban,'' said Mariela Quintana,
the child's paternal grandmother, after a meeting with lawmakers. President
Clinton said he would not rule out a veto if Congress passes the citizenship
bill.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, part of the Justice
Department, ordered the boy's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, to bring Elian to a
4 p.m. EST Wednesday meeting with the grandmothers at an ``appropriate neutral
location.''
</P>
<P>
	   The INS specified that location: the Miami Beach home of Barry University
President Jeanne O'Laughlin, a sister in the Dominican order.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling followed Gonzalez's rejection Monday of a meeting anywhere other
than his own home.
</P>
<P>
	   The meeting ``is only a visit'' and does not change the boy's status, said
the letter signed by Michael A. Pearson, executive associate immigration
commissioner for field operations.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS has ruled that the boy should be returned to his father in Cuba.
Elian's Florida relatives have challenged that order in federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have everybody's word that the child will not be taken away,''
O'Laughlin said in an interview with The Associated Press. ``I wouldn't
participate if that was the case.''
</P>
<P>
	   If the relatives refuse to bring the boy to the meeting, Justice attorneys
could go into federal court in Miami for an order directing compliance, said
department officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy was found clinging to a life preserver in the Atlantic on Nov. 25
after his mother and others died when their boat sank en route from Cuba to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Carol Fouke, a spokeswoman for the National Council of Churches, which
sponsored the grandmothers' trip, applauded the order for Wednesday's meeting
and said the grandmothers planned to leave Washington for Miami early Wednesday
morning, weather permitting. Washington was in the grips of a fierce snowstorm
that blanketed the area with more than a foot of snow.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers told reporters they had never seen snow before -- and were
surprised it was so cold.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the snowstorm, which closed many congressional offices, the two
women made the rounds of Capitol Hill on Tuesday, meeting with legislators
sympathetic to their wish to have Elian returned to his father's custody in Cuba
and their opposition to congressionally imposed citizenship on Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The only one who has a legal right with that child is his father,''
Quintana said.
</P>
<P>
	   Several Democratic senators suggested after meetings with the grandmothers
that they would wage a filibuster on the Senate floor, if necessary, to try to
block the citizenship bill.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It doesn't belong on the Senate floor,'' said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.
Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., agreed, saying, ``This boy ought to go home and
be with his father.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., and others who met with the women said the
grandmothers told them Elian's mother was on the ill-fated boat not to flee
Castro's oppression but because of pressure from her boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We asked some rather pointed questions,'' Hagel said. ``She was forced on
that boat.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, said after her meeting with the
grandmothers that she has asked Clinton to fight the citizenship legislation,
even if it means he has to veto it. ``Elian Gonzalez is not an orphan,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers brought with them a photo album and displayed a page with
an enlarged picture of Elian's Cuban family -- minus Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   Suggesting the picture showed how much Elian was missed, Raquel Rodriquez,
Elian's maternal grandmother, said that after losing her daughter in the boat
disaster, having U.S. citizenship forced upon Elian ``would be more painful''
and prolong the agony.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have no one else,'' she said, tears streaming down her face.
</P>
<P>
	   At the White House, Clinton urged Congress to delay action until the issue
had played out in court and to think first about ``what is right for the
child.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if he would veto such a bill, Clinton said, ``I have not decided what
to do and I would not rule that out.''
</P>
<P>
	   Versions of the citizenship bill were introduced Monday in both the House
and the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   The measure, drafted by members of the Florida congressional delegation,
would confer U.S. citizenship on Elian, thus removing the INS jurisdiction from
the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., a supporter of the bill, told
reporters Tuesday the Senate likely will debate the bill early next week, rather
than Wednesday as he earlier predicted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we're trying to do is find the best way to have an impartial,
nonpolitical decision made for the young boy,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sponsors blamed the delay on the snowstorm and the large number of senators
still out of town.
</P>
<P>
	   In his letter, Pearson of the INS said the site for the meeting -- Sister
O'Laughlin's home -- is in a gated area where security can be assured.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Laughlin said the INS asked her Monday night whether her home could be
used.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm trying to keep the child in my prayers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The decision (on custody) either way is not my priority,'' she added. ``My
priority is to really see that love can truly conquer all. This child, I really
believe, is loved by both sides and I don't know how that will resolve itself.
To facilitate their unity around him is very important.''

<HEADLINE> Police Warn of IRA Dissident Threat  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Ireland's security chief warned Tuesday
that Irish Republican Army dissidents are actively planning to wreck the peace
in Northern Ireland and likely will evade police surveillance sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have been successful in dealing with them over a period, but we have to
be vigilant all the time. They have to be lucky only once,'' said Pat Byrne,
commissioner of the police force in the neighboring Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
	   His force arrested two more people Tuesday on suspicion of trying to break
the IRA's 30-month-old truce.
</P>
<P>
	   Byrne spoke shortly before a Belfast-based disarmament commission announced
it would publish a long-awaited report on Monday that assesses whether the IRA
is finally willing to disarm in support of the 1998 peace accord.
</P>
<P>
	   The unresolved issue of disarmament, so long at the center of difficulties
in Northern Ireland peacemaking, is threatening to dissolve the province's
Protestant-Catholic administration just weeks after its formation.
</P>
<P>
	   David Trimble, the Protestant leader of the four-party administration formed
last month, expects the Cabinet to be suspended -- and powers handed at least
temporarily back to the British government in London -- if next Monday's report
confirms the IRA has not yet begun to disarm.
</P>
<P>
	   Otherwise, Trimble has promised his Protestant supporters to withdraw his
Ulster Unionist Party from the Cabinet. This, too, would force the suspension of
a coalition that includes the IRA-linked Sinn Fein party.
</P>
<P>
	   Trimble called on Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams to stop blaming Protestant
politicians for the impending crisis, and to start getting the IRA to disarm.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have done our bit, but the leaders of Sinn Fein and the IRA have yet to
do theirs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, senior IRA figures began meeting the disarmament commission's
chairman, Canadian Gen. John de Chastelain, in secret.
</P>
<P>
	   But the IRA has offered no sign it will identify any of its weapons dumps --
most of which are hidden in the Irish Republic countryside -- in line with the
peace accord's expectation of total disarmament by all paramilitary groups by
May.
</P>
<P>
	   The Continuity IRA and Real IRA, two splinter groups founded by
disillusioned IRA members opposed to compromise, have appealed in recent weeks
for fresh defectors.
</P>
<P>
	   Both factions oppose Sinn Fein's newfound involvement in governing Northern
Ireland, a Protestant-majority state the IRA long pledged to destroy.
</P>
<P>
	   The Real IRA was responsible for killing 29 people in a 1998 car-bomb attack
on the Northern Irish town of Omagh -- the bloodiest terrorist strike in three
decades of strife.

<HEADLINE> Feds To Watch Foster Care Agencies  </HEADLINE>
   By KAREN GULLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prompted by moving tales of neglect and abuse, the
federal government seized new powers Tuesday to protect the nation's
half-million foster children and push states to find them permanent homes more
quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   Under federal rules that will take effect in March, federal health officials
will, for the first time, interview children and foster parents to check for
signs of abuse or neglect, conduct inspections at state agencies and monitor
programs for recruiting adoptive parents.
</P>
<P>
	   States would also be required to conduct criminal background checks on
prospective foster and adoptive parents. Those states cited for doing a poor job
protecting children could lose up to 14 percent of their federal child welfare
funds each year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This regulation demonstrates a critical and significant shift in holding
states accountable for children's safety and permanency while promoting their
well-being,'' Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said.
</P>
<P>
	   The new powers were granted to Shalala's department in recent laws passed by
Congress that shifted the focus in foster care to protecting children from abuse
rather than making their return to their biological families the first priority.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 540,000 U.S. children are in foster care -- many removed from
homes because of abuse and neglect. Most return to their parents, but others
stay in foster care because of continuing threats.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers began acting in 1997 to give the government a greater voice in the
$7.5 billion a year foster care system, $4 billion of which is paid by the
federal government. They were moved in part by harrowing tales of neglect and
abuse in some state programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The Child Welfare League of America reported that in 1996, the last year for
which there are statistics, more than 3,000 children were abused or neglected by
foster parents and 14 died.
</P>
<P>
	   Even after Congress acted, more sad examples emerged.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, a Philadelphia woman was charged with beating her 6-year-old foster
daughter to death, stuffing the body into a duffel bag and tossing it into a
river.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at the city's human services bureau said the agency had no
indication that there was violence in the household.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the new regulations, states will be held accountable if children are
abused or neglected in foster care.
</P>
<P>
	   Welfare officials applauded the landmark change but raised concerns that the
government is providing no new money to help states comply with new reporting
and oversight requirements.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Historically the system that was used for accountability was a system that
measured processes. What's dramatic and different is now we're saying let's
measure for safety and permanency,'' said William Waldman, executive director,
American Public Human Services Association, whose members include state welfare
agencies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've taken the position that if they're going to make new requirements,
they need to provide the funds.''
</P>
<P>
	   The regulations were required by the 1997 Adoption and Safe Families Act,
which focused on protecting children and speeding up adoptions. Foster children
often spend up to three years in foster care while state agencies attempt to
improve conditions in the home.
</P>
<P>
	   The new regulations clarify that states don't have to return children to
their birth homes if safety is an issue but should speed efforts to find
permanent homes.
</P>
<P>
	   States must obtain a court order once a year explaining why children are
still in foster care and must begin termination of parental rights for children
who are in foster care 15 out of the previous 22 months.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past, the department simply reviewed case files to gauge how well the
states were serving children. There were no penalties if children languished in
foster homes for years or were neglected.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, states could lose one percent of their child welfare funding for each
infraction up to a maximum of 14 percent. They are required to fix the problems
within two years and penalties increase each year if problems persist.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a wonderful beginning,'' said Shirley Marcus Allen, acting
co-director of the Child Welfare League of America, noting the new measure had
``teeth.''
</P>
<P>
	   States also face punishment if they discriminate against adoptive parents
who want to give a home to a child of another race. A 1996 adoption law prevents
states from using race as a basis for placing children.

<HEADLINE> Venator To Cut 3,700 Jobs  </HEADLINE>
    By RACHEL BECK AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The belt got even tighter at Venator Group Inc. on Tuesday
as the retailer formerly known as Woolworth took another stab at restructuring
its troubled business by slashing about 3,700 jobs and closing 358
underperforming stores.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent years, the company has shuttered thousands of stores and sold many
of its noncore divisions as its shifted its focus primarily to sporting goods.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is taking a while but they are doing what they need to do to get this
business in shape," said Lee Backus, senior vice president at Buckingham
Research Group in New York. "I believe in the end they could emerge the winners
in the sporting goods market."
</P>
<P>
	   The retailer will cut about 30 percent of its sales and corporate staff in
the United States and Canada. That includes about 600 corporate staffers and
3,100 people who work in its stores. About four of every five jobs eliminated
will be in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Venator also will close 123 Foot Locker, Lady Foot Locker and Kids Foot
Locker stores, 27 Champs stores and 208 Northern Group clothing stores. That
includes the disposal of all the Northern Getaway and Northern Elements stores
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Venator also said it will consolidate the management teams of its Kids and
Lady Foot Locker stores. In addition, it will close the Champs distribution
center in Maumelle, Ark., and consolidate its operation with the Foot Locker
facility located in Junction City, Kan.
</P>
<P>
	   The company is moving its corporate offices out of the historic Woolworth
building in downtown Manhattan, which it sold in 1998. Its new base will be at
its midtownFoot Locker headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   Venator will take an after-tax charge against earnings in the fourth quarter
of $53 million, or 39 cents a share, to cover the costs of the restructuring.
But it said it expects the cutbacks to add $50 million a yearto its pretax
earnings, starting in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
	   On the news, Venator stock rose 12 1/2 cents to $6.50 a share as of 5:15
p.m. EST on the New York Stock Exchange. That's still substantially below the
52-week high of $12 reached in May.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday's announcement is only the latest restructuring. In recent years,
Venator has attempted to lift sagging profits by reducing costs and closing
stores -- including all of its Woolworth five-and-dime and Kinney Shoe stores.
</P>
<P>
	   Venator also has sold many of it businesses -- including the accessories
chain Afterthoughts and the Colorado Group of shoe and clothing stores in
Australia -- that weren't tied to its core sporting goods divisions.
</P>
<P>
	   Venator now operates more than 4,000 stores, mostly under the Foot Locker
and Champs Sports name.
</P>
<P>
	   Its efforts seem to be helping boost its bottom line. Venator's profits for
the third quarter were $7 million, or 5 cents a share, compared with a loss of
$155 million, or $1.14 a share, in the same quarter a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The company is expected to report its fourth-quarter or year-end results in
the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Al Kingsley, senior managing director at Greenway Partners -- which owns
more than 14 percent of Venator's stock and has been one of the company's most
vocal critics -- said the cutbacks were another step towards bringing the
company back to health.
</P>
<P>
	   He lauded Venator for getting rid of stores that aren't bringing in
satisfactory sales and paring down its costs.
</P>
<P>
	   "The whole athletic footwear and apparel industry is shrinking, and Venator
is helping it by shrinking a lot. That is good for everyone in the business,"
Kingsley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, analysts warn that Venator isn't out of trouble yet. The sporting
goods industry is a tough market to be in right now, with shoppers buying far
fewer sneakers and athletic apparel than they did in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   Rival Just For Feet filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection from
its creditors in November, and Sports Authority has seen its sales slump.
</P>
<P>
	   For the first nine months of 1999, total sales in the athletic footwear
market were $9.93 billion, down 1 percent from the same period the year before
and off 10 percent from 1997, according to the Sporting Goods Manufacturers
Association and The NPD Group, a market research firm.
</P>
<P>
	   During that period, the number of pairs of footwear sold fell by 5 percent
from 1998 and 13 percent from 1997.

<HEADLINE> Putin Steps Into Opposition Boycott  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM HEINTZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Acting President Vladimir Putin stepped into the opposition
boycott of parliament on Tuesday, meeting with a top opposition leader in an
attempt to end the walkout.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers from three liberal and centrist parties left the State Duma's
first session last week to protest a deal between the chamber's two largest
groups, the Communists and Unity, a pro-government bloc. Under the deal,
Communist Gennady Seleznyov was elected Duma speaker and the parties divided
control of most of the chamber's posts.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal raised questions about Putin's commitment to democratic reforms.
Unity labels itself as centrist and its willingness to work with the Communists,
who call for a return to the Soviet system, alarmed many Russians.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Putin and Boris Gryzlov, head of Unity's parliamentary faction,
met with Sergei Kiriyenko, head of the Union of Right Forces party, to discuss a
compromise. Kiriyenko said the talks ``managed a breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kiriyenko's party and the two other parties that walked out -- Yabloko and
Fatherland-All Russia -- were to meet Wednesday to discuss the potential
compromise.
</P>
<P>
	   Seleznyov, the speaker, said earlier Tuesday that the parties had two days
to accept an offer of several committee posts or be frozen out of the Duma
leadership.
</P>
<P>
	   ``On Friday we must draw a line,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Seleznyov said that up to three new committees could be created, with the
chairmanships going to the opposition groups in addition to posts they already
had been offered. Initially, the Union of Right Forces and Fatherland-All
Russia, were offered one committee chairmanship each; Yabloko was offered none.
</P>
<P>
	   Kiriyenko said his party had rejected the idea of dividing committee posts.
But after the meeting with Putin, he said Unity had agreed to support his
party's law proposals and procedural changes that would defend the interests of
smaller parties.
</P>
<P>
	   There were signs earlier Tuesday that the protesters' unity was breaking
down. The Regions of Russia group, some of whose members had joined in the
parliamentary walkout, accepted the chairmanship of the budget committee and one
of the deputy speaker's posts.
</P>
<P>
	   Grigory Yavlinsky, head of Yabloko, said that the minority could not afford
to leave the Duma in the hands of the ultranationalist leader Vladimir
Zhirinovsky, the Kremlin and the Communists.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a gray force that cannot pass the laws the country needs,''
Yavlinsky said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile Tuesday, the head of the Central Bank said Russia intends to pay
this year's foreign debt with its own resources. Viktor Gerashchenko said the
Central Bank has ``saved a bit of reserve funds'' and could give the Finance
Ministry up to $1 billion if needed, ITAR-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
	   Moscow already has met $750 million in obligations this month and would pay
in full the $1.05 billion due in January for post-Soviet debt, said First Deputy
Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov. Russia has defaulted on about $100 billion in
Soviet-era debt, but tried to remain current on about $50 billion run up since
1991.
</P>
<P>
	   An International Monetary Fund team arrived in Moscow on Tuesday for talks
with top government officials. The IMF froze its lending program to Russia in
September, saying reforms have been insufficient. Gerashchenko did not expect
IMF lending to resume at least until April.

<HEADLINE> McGraw-Hill Posts Jump in Profits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The McGraw-Hill Cos. reported a 30 percent jump in
fourth-quarter profits due to strong showings in textbook publishing, the
Standard &AMP; Poor's financial information service and Business Week magazine.
</P>
<P>
	   McGraw-Hill said Tuesday its net income for the quarter was $96.6 million
compared to $74.4 million in the same period a year ago. Per-share earnings rose
to 49 cents from 37 cents. The figures excluded a one-time gain of $39.7 million
in 1999 on the sale of two special-interest magazines.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues rose 10 percent to $1.03 billion from $938.2 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Harold McGraw III, chairman and CEO, said the company had an unexpectedly
strong fourth quarter in all three of its business groups -- financial services,
book publishing and media.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial services revenues jumped 12 percent as Standard &AMP; Poor's ratings
service saw strong growth in Europe, where the introduction of the euro, the
currency used by 11 nations, prompted new issues of several kinds of debt.
</P>
<P>
	   Operating profits from textbooks and professional book publishing jumped 26
percent in 1999, excluding a one-time charge, while operating profits from the
company's media group, which includes Business Week magazine, grew 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   McGraw-Hill also publishes several special interest magazines, including
Aviation Week and publications covering the construction, health care and energy
industries.
</P>
<P>
	   For the full year, net profits were $401.6 million, or $2.02 per share,
compared to $335.4 million, or $1.68 per share in 1998. Revenues rose 7 percent
to $3.99 billion from $3.73 billion.

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks that are moving substantially or trading heavily
today on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney reported earnings per share of 25 cents in its fiscal first quarter,
beating analysts' estimate of 20 cents due to strong results from the ABC
broadcast group. Merrill Lynch, Salomon Smith Barney and Goldman Sachs all
raised their ratings on the stock.
</P>
<P>
	   The company reported earnings of 51 cents a share, compared with Wall Street
expectations of 47 cents a share. Texas Instruments cited heavy demand for chips
used in wireless communications devices.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said it earned 21 cents per share in its fiscal third quarter,
well below analysts' forecast of 30 cents per share. McKesson officials said
they don't anticipate a meaningful rebound in software sales until late this
year.
</P>
<P>
	   The company earned 63 cents per share in its fourth quarter, up from 49
cents in the fourth quarter of 1998. Waters' businesses including liquid
chromatography and thermal analysis help develop new drugs, break down the
nutritional content of foods and test air and water quality.
</P>
<P>
	   The company met earnings expectations for the fourth quarter, but warned
that results for the first quarter of 2000 will suffer as the company spends
heavily on sales and marketing of new products. Tellabs makes equipment that
manages traffic on telephone networks.
</P>
<P>
	   The company expects to report fourth-quarter earnings of 20 to 22 cents a
share, below analysts' estimates of 37 cents per shares. Sykes said several
major customer contracts that were expected to be completed in the fourth
quarter were not formally executed.
</P>
<P>
	   The company earned 17 cents per share in its fiscal third quarter, down from
22 cents per share in the third quarter of 1998. PSS, a distributor of medical
products, said problems with suppliers hurt its revenues in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The company will be added to the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index on Friday.
Companies added to the index often get a boost as fund managers who try to
mirror the index's performance buy shares of the newly added company.

<HEADLINE> Competitors Appeal Tabloid Ruling  </HEADLINE>
    By BILL BERGSTROM AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A group of newspaper publishers filed an appeal Tuesday
seeking to overturn a federal judge's decision that allowed a new competitor to
continue distributing newspapers at area train, subway and bus stops.
</P>
<P>
	   The publishers of The Philadelphia Inquirer, the Philadelphia Daily News,
The New York Times and USA Today have argued that Metro enjoys an unfair
advantage because of an unconstitutional agreement with the Southeastern
Pennsylvania Transportation Authority.
</P>
<P>
	   The tabloid published its second edition Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The other newspapers argue that Metro's contract with SEPTA is
unconstitutional because it allows a government agency to assert control over a
newspaper and allows the free paper to be distributed where other publications
cannot be sold.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Robert F. Kelly denied the newspapers a temporary
restraining order Monday, saying they failed to show that they would suffer
"immediate and irreparable harm" if the order was not granted.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspapers appealed Kelly's decision to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals and filed a motion seeking an injunction barring the distribution of
Metro pending the appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the clerk's office was open, Kelly's office was closed because of
heavy snow. Michael Schwartz, attorney for the newspapers challenging Metro,
said he did not know when to expect action on his requests.

<HEADLINE> Heating Oil Prices Up Again  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Heating oil prices surged 4 percent Tuesday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange as an East Coast snowstorm revived an explosive rally that had begun
fizzling the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   Crude oil futures also advanced.
</P>
<P>
	   In other commodities markets, soybean prices rose to new three-month highs
and pork bellies gained.
</P>
<P>
	   After sinking 8 percent Monday on profit-taking and milder weather for the
Northeast, quelling a rally that had padded the price by 44 percent over two
weeks, heating oil prices resumed their sharply upward path.
</P>
<P>
	   Heating oil for February delivery rose 4.03 cents to 90.38 cents a gallon --
just 3.12 cents short of the nine-year high it reached after skyrocketing on
frigid weather in the Northeast last week.
</P>
<P>
	   That puts a tighter squeeze on heating oil retailers and, ultimately,
consumers at a time when midwinter demand is soaring and supplies are tight.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest catalyst in the market was the worst snowstorm to hit the
Northeast since the blizzard of January 1996. Snow fell from Maine to South
Carolina and parts of North Carolina got two feet in the kind of storm that
sends heating oil demand soaring.
</P>
<P>
	   Phil Flynn, energy analyst for Alaron Trading Corp. in Chicago, said
Monday's pullback turned out to have been only a correction in a market still
bullish over shrinking petroleum supplies as a result of continuing lower oil
production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
	   "As soon as they (investors) took profits yesterday, they realized we're
still facing another winter storm and some really tight supplies," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're still in the same boat. It appears OPEC's going to continue to hold
the line on production. Supplies are very, very tight, and people are nervous,
people are panicky," Flynn said.
</P>
<P>
	   March intermediate crude rose 45 cents to $28.28 a barrel; February unleaded
gasoline rose 1.31 cents to 76.79 cents a gallon; February natural gas rose 8.8
cents to $2.616 per 1,000 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
	   In London, March Brent oil from the North Sea rose 48 cents to $26.54 a
barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Soybeans pushed to a second straight high on the Chicago Board of Trade amid
continued dryness in key growing regions of South America. The long arid stretch
has raised questions about crop quantity and could have a substantial impact on
world supplies.
</P>
<P>
	   March soybeans rose 5 cents to $5.17 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
	   Frozen pork bellies, which are cured to make bacon, climbed higher on
continued high demand for bacon sandwiches -- used increasingly by U.S.
fast-food chains.
</P>
<P>
	   February bellies rose 1.22 cents to 88.77 cents a pound on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Top Managers Shuffled at Fidelity  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BOSTON (AP) -- J. Gary Burkhead, a vice chairman of Fidelity Investments and
president of its Personal Investments and Brokerage Group, is retiring, Fidelity
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Gail J. McGovern, a senior operating officer in Personal Investments, will
take his place.
</P>
<P>
	   Burkhead, 58, will remain a director of FMR Corp., the parent company of
Fidelity Investments.
</P>
<P>
	   As president of Fidelity Personal Investments and Brokerage Group, Burkhead
was responsible for Fidelity's retail mutual fund and brokerage operations;
related systems and processing groups; and institutional brokerage.
</P>
<P>
	   In a related announcement, the company said that Stephen A. Cone has
resigned from his position as president, retail and corporate marketing, to
pursue a new career opportunity in New York. McGovern also assumes Cone's
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
	   Eric Kobren, executive editor of Fidelity Insight, an independent newsletter
on Fidelity funds and services, said the announcement wasn't a surprise. He said
Burkhead had groomed McGovern as his successor.
</P>
<P>
	   "I see this as a positive end to a process that was laid out over two years
ago to bring in some new blood into retail marketing and take it forward," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Prices Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Long-term treasury bond prices rose slightly Tuesday after
President Clinton said he would propose paying off the government's debt earlier
than projected.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the 30-year note climbed 3/16 point, or $1.87 1/2 per $1,000 in
face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.63
percent from 6.64 percent late Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Trading was light in other issues, which closed with little change.
Investors were awaiting congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan. Greenspan, whose appearance before the Senate Budget Committee was
canceled Tuesday due to a winter storm, has another date before legislators on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Prices of short-term Treasury securities fell by between 1/32 point and 1/16
point, and intermediate maturities fell by 1/32 to 3/32 point, as reported
Bridge Telerate, a financial information service.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.56 percent as the discount rose
0.01 percentage point from Monday's auction to 5.40 percent. Six-month yields
were 5.77 percent, as the discount rose 0.01 percentage point from the weekly
auction, to 5.53 percent. One-year yields were 6.09 percent as the discount rose
0.02 percentage point from late Monday to 5.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the
interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was
steady at 5.50 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bond Buyer index for municipal bonds rose 1/32 to 91 7/32 point. The
yield was 6.31 percent, unchanged from late Monday.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T 4Q Profits Decline  </HEADLINE>
    By BRUCE MEYERSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T is making big strides toward building its new
telephone and Web business over cable TV lines, but the high cost of reinventing
the company weighed on fourth-quarter profits.
</P>
<P>
	   By the end of the year, AT&AMP;T had 207,000 subscribers for high-speed Internet
access via cable, an increase of 80,000 during the final three months of 1999,
and the company was installing the service at about 1,000 homes a day.
</P>
<P>
	   Local phone service, meanwhile, was being tested on cable systems in nine
markets by year-end, AT&AMP;T said Tuesday, standing by projections that it would
have between 400,000 and 500,000 customers for that offering by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Naturally, however, the bottom line was hit hard by the hefty expense of
introducing those services on outdated cable systems, mostly those acquired with
Tele-Communications Inc., as well as upgrading and increasing capacity on AT&AMP;T's
overtaxed wireless network.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourth-quarter net income was $1.15 billion, or 36 cents a share, including
one-time factors. In the year-ago period, AT&AMP;T earned $1.99 billion, or 75 cents
a share, including a one-time gain.
</P>
<P>
	   The company didn't provide a quarterly tally of its capital expenditures
with its report on the final months of last year, but the total for all of 1999
reached $13.5 billion, with about three-quarters of the total going to
growth-oriented projects such as cable and wireless.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, AT&AMP;T topped most Wall Street forecasts for the fourth quarter,
earning $1.84 billion, or 57 cents per share, excluding one-time factors.
</P>
<P>
	   Those figures compared with an operating profit of $1.80 billion, or 68
cents per share, in the fourth quarter of 1998 -- including the performance of
the TCI cable operation and IBM Global Network, both of which AT&AMP;T was still in
the process of acquiring at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   Earnings per share declined even as total earnings rose because AT&AMP;T issued
billions of dollars worth of stock to pay for TCI and other purchases during the
year. So, by the end of 1999, there were 568 million more AT&AMP;T shares in
circulation compared with the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest results didn't reflect one-time charges of $496 million for
expenses such as upgrading AT&AMP;T's wireless network and severance pay for about
2,800 employees who lost their jobs or accepted a buyout during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourth-quarter revenues totaled $16.34 billion, an increase of 5.9 percent
from $15.42 billion in the same period in 1998, also adjusted to include the TCI
and IBM operations that had not yet been acquired.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's flagship long-distance calling business, the nation's biggest
by a wide margin, saw sales drop 4.5 percent in the fourth quarter as price wars
continued to eat away at revenues.
</P>
<P>
	   Notably, it was the first full quarter since the introduction of the "one
rate" plan charging seven cents per minute for long distance calls around the
clock.
</P>
<P>
	   At year end, there were about 500,000 subscribers to the new plan, one third
of whom had switched from other companies, and two-thirds of whose bills were
averaging at least $25 per month, the company said.
</P>
<P>
	   AT&AMP;T officials reiterated their view that long distance is just one aspect
of the new emphasis on bundled services, whether through cable or wireless -- or
even regular phone lines leased from rivals such as Bell Atlantic in New York,
where the company now has 150,000 customers buying both local and long-distance
service.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, AT&AMP;T's profit totaled $5.45 billion, or $1.74 per share,
down from $6.40 billion, or $2.37 a share, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year's operating profit amounted to $2.20 a share, down from $2.35 a
share in 1998, with both tallies adjusted to include a full year of results from
TCI and other operations acquired during 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Including the same adjustments, revenues for 1999 totaled $64.14 billion, an
increase of 6.2 percent from $60.39 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   In Tuesday at 5:15 EST on the New York Stock Exchange, AT&AMP;T rose 81 1/4
cents a share to $51.31 1/4.

<HEADLINE> Leader: No Puppet Gov't in Ecuador  </HEADLINE>
   By GONZALO SOLANO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Ecuador's new president declared Tuesday that his
government is not under the sway of military officers who toppled his
predecessor and put him in charge of this troubled Andean nation.
</P>
<P>
	   Gustavo Noboa, who was Ecuador's vice president until President Jamil Mahuad
was removed last week, said on television Tuesday that he was not beholden to
the military generals who put him in power.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Absolutely not,'' he said. ``I am here because I am fulfilling a duty that
I will carry out well.''
</P>
<P>
	   Noboa took office Saturday after Mahuad was forced out in a step the
military said was taken to avoid ``a social explosion'' after hundreds of
Indians and young military officers stormed the Congress building and declared a
new government.
</P>
<P>
	   However, some military experts and the former defense minister say the
generals who handed Noboa the presidency did so under pressure from Washington
and more than 20 regional commanders who rejected the overthrow of civilian
rule.
</P>
<P>
	   Armed forces chief Gen. Carlos Mendoza, who briefly took a place in the
junta before turning power over to Noboa, said he agreed to join the coup as a
stall tactic until democratic order could be restored.
</P>
<P>
	   He resigned his post and Gen. Telmo Sandoval took over as military
commander.
</P>
<P>
	   But Jose Gallardo, who had served as Mahuad's defense minister until a week
before the coup, said Mendoza and Sandoval knew of the plans by junior officers
to support the Indian protests and tried to take advantage of the situation to
seize power.
</P>
<P>
	   Gallardo, a retired army general, said the first thing that Noboa should do
is replace Sandoval, whom he described as politically ambitious ``and not to be
trusted.''
</P>
<P>
	   The new government must still confront Ecuador's worst economic crisis in
decades.
</P>
<P>
	   Inflation topped 60 percent last year, the highest in Latin America, and the
economy contracted 7.5 percent. Only one in three in the labor force has a
full-time job and 7 million of Ecuador's 12 million people are trapped in
poverty.
</P>
<P>
	   Another challenge will be combating rampant corruption and restoring trust
in politicians, many of whom seek public office for personal gain and have
little interest in improving the lives of the poor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I implore the nation's political class, please, for the first time in many
years, let us move forward together,'' Noboa said. ``The country deserves it.''

<HEADLINE> Merrill Lynch Beats Expectations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The booming stock market allowed Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., the
largest brokerage firm in the United States, to double its fourth-quarter
earnings from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York-based company reported earnings Tuesday of $764 million, easily
beating analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's profits represent earnings of $1.80 a share, well above the
$1.39 a share analysts had predicted, according to First Call Corp. In the
fourth quarter of 1998, Merrill Lynch reported profits of $359 million, or 86
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourth-quarter profits were down across Wall Street last year, as securities
firms contended with the fallout from the Asian and Russian financial crises.
</P>
<P>
	   Merrill Lynch attributed the strong results to record revenues in its
investment banking business, which includes underwriting initial public stock
offerings and providing advice on mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
	   Total fourth-quarter revenues were $5.9 billion, up from $4.1 billion a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
	   "A strong fourth quarter capped a very strong year. Investors embraced our
new choice platform combining technology with advice and guidance, and brought
new assets to Merrill Lynch at an accelerating rate," said Merrill Lynch
chairman David Komansky.
</P>
<P>
	   Like many old line Wall Street brokerage firms, Merrill Lynch this year
began offering clients online trading services at lower rates than their
traditional full service brokerage fees.
</P>
<P>
	   For the full year, Merrill Lynch posted earnings of $2.6 billion, or $6.17 a
share, up from $1.3 billion, or $3 a share, in 1998, when the company reported a
one-time loss of $430 million related to staff layoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   Full year revenues came to $21.9 billion, compared to $17.5 billion a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors interpreted the earnings as good news, pushing shares of Merrill
Lynch up $5 to $80.68 3/4 in trading at 5:15 p.m. on the New York Stock
Exchange.

<HEADLINE> N.M. Woman Contracts Plague  </HEADLINE>
   By MATT MYGATT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Debra Welsh is feeling better, thank you,
considering her brush with bubonic plague.
</P>
<P>
	   And she's learned a lesson: Don't touch wobbly mice.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those little drunken, wobbly mice would get into the house and you could
get right up to them and pick them up by their tails and drop them in the
toilet,'' she said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``And they would die real fast. We found six of them over the past six
months,'' Welsh said from her St. Joseph Hospital bed, where a tube trickled
antibiotics into her body to fight the disease.
</P>
<P>
	   Welsh, 43, who lives just north of Albuquerque, was confirmed late Monday as
suffering from the disease -- the first human plague case of the year in New
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She's in fine condition,'' said Dr. David Keller, chief of the infectious
disease epidemiology program at the state Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
	   Keller said the department is trying to determine how Welsh got the plague,
but she has an idea. She found the last wobbly mouse around Christmas.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I actually saw it and it ran behind a cabinet. Then one of the dogs was
scratching at something, and the mouse had died at the foot of the pedestal
table,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Welsh used a paper towel to pick up the mouse and tossed it in the garbage,
then washed her hands with antibacterial soap.
</P>
<P>
	   She became ill Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I noticed that I had a swollen lymph node, then it quickly went downhill
from there. The chills. Lower back pain like you can get with the flu,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, she went to see a doctor, who immediately ordered her
hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
	   Plague is typically thought to be a summertime disease, but can strike
year-round. The last human plague death in the state was in 1994 -- an
8-year-old northern New Mexico boy.
</P>
<P>
	   Bubonic plague, also known as the Black Death, killed an estimated 25
million people in Europe between 1346 and 1351, wiping out nearly one-third of
the population. It is a bacterial disease, generally transmitted to humans from
the bites of fleas infected by dead or dying rodents. Most people lapse into
illness within seven days after exposure.
</P>
<P>
	   Symptoms include chills and fever; painful, swollen lymph nodes in the
groin, armpit or neck; and sometimes headache, vomiting and diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Department of Health recommends that pets and people keep away
from sick or dead rodents, keep children from playing near rodent nests or
burrows and clean areas near houses where rodents could live.
</P>
<P>
	   Welsh said construction is still being done on her house, so it's easy for
mice and other critters to get in. But she won't ever again try to get rid of
rodents on her own.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The state is coming out,'' she said. ``I think they're going to
exterminate around the house.''

<HEADLINE> American Home Matches Forecasts  </HEADLINE>
    By PHIL GALEWITZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- American Home Products Corp., in the midst of a takeover
battle for Warner-Lambert Co. said its fourth-quarter earnings rose 1 percent,
well below the pharmaceutical industry's double-digit average.
</P>
<P>
	   The performance matched analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson &AMP; Johnson said its fourth-quarter profit jumped 12 percent excluding
unusual charges, exceeding Wall Street forecasts by a cent.
</P>
<P>
	   Madison, N.J.-based American Home said it earned $593.2 million or 45 cents
per share in the fourth quarter, compared to $590.1 million or 44 cents per
share in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The year-ago figures reflect a $240.5 million restructuring charge.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home's results met the predictions of analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thomson Financial. Shares of American Home fell $2.06 1/4 to $40.50 in
trading at 5:15 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales rose 7 percent in the latest quarter to $3.47 billion from $3.23
billion. Drug sales rose 8 percent to $2.39 billion on strong sales of American
Home's rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel, which is co-marketed by Immunex, and
its hormone replacement drug Premarin.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1999, American Home took a $3.29 billion charge to pay the legal costs
associated with a national settlement of its diet drug lawsuits. Including that
charge, American Home lost $1.23 billion or 94 cents per share in 1999, compared
to a profit of $2.47 billion or $1.85 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding the unusual charges, American Home had a $2.33 billion profit or
$1.78 per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales in 1999 rose 2 percent to $13.55 billion from $13.46 billion. Drug
sales rose 7 percent for the year to $9.50 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the huge diet drug settlement, American Home was plagued by
poor sales of its herbicides and pesticides. Agricultural product sales rose 3
percent in the quarter, but fell 24 percent for all of 1999 to $1.67 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   American Home and rival Pfizer Inc. have both made offers to buy
Warner-Lambert. On Monday, Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. said it would not pursue a bid
for both American Home and Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding special charges, New Brunswick, N.J.-based Johnson &AMP; Johnson had a
fourth-quarter profit of $796 million or 56 cents per share, compared to $712
million or 50 cents a share a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The special charges, which totaled $42 million, included costs of buying
biotechnology firm Centocor in 1999 and layoffs that occurred in 1998. Including
those charges, fourth-quarter profit was $754 million, or 53 cents per share,
compared with $102 million or 7 cents per share, in the year ago period.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial predicted earnings per
share of 55 cents for the latest quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales in the quarter rose 6.3 percent to $6.88 billion from $6.47 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, excluding special charges, the company's profit rose 13
percent to $4.2 billion or $2.94 per share, from $3.7 billion or $2.12 per share
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Including the charges, J&AMP;J's profit a year ago was $3 billion a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales for all of 1999 rose 14.5 percent to $27.47 billion from $24 billion
in 1998. Drug sales rose 20.2 percent to $10.7 billion during 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The company cited strong sales growth of its key products, including the
anemia drug Procrit, and the antipsychotic drug Risperdol.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of J&AMP;J rose $1.56 1/4 to $85.25 in trading at 5:15 p.m. on the NYSE.

	   And she's learned a lesson: Don't touch wobbly mice.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those little drunken, wobbly mice would get into the house and you could
get right up to them and pick them up by their tails and drop them in the
toilet,'' she said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``And they would die real fast. We found six of them over the past six
months,'' Welsh said from her St. Joseph Hospital bed, where a tube trickled
antibiotics into her body to fight the disease.
</P>
<P>
	   Welsh, 43, who lives just north of Albuquerque, was confirmed late Monday as
suffering from the disease -- the first human plague case of the year in New
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She's in fine condition,'' said Dr. David Keller, chief of the infectious
disease epidemiology program at the state Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
	   Keller said the department is trying to determine how Welsh got the plague,
but she has an idea. She found the last wobbly mouse around Christmas.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I actually saw it and it ran behind a cabinet. Then one of the dogs was
scratching at something, and the mouse had died at the foot of the pedestal
table,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Welsh used a paper towel to pick up the mouse and tossed it in the garbage,
then washed her hands with antibacterial soap.
</P>
<P>
	   She became ill Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I noticed that I had a swollen lymph node, then it quickly went downhill
from there. The chills. Lower back pain like you can get with the flu,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, she went to see a doctor, who immediately ordered her
hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
	   Plague is typically thought to be a summertime disease, but can strike
year-round. The last human plague death in the state was in 1994 -- an
8-year-old northern New Mexico boy.
</P>
<P>
	   Bubonic plague, also known as the Black Death, killed an estimated 25
million people in Europe between 1346 and 1351, wiping out nearly one-third of
the population. It is a bacterial disease, generally transmitted to humans from
the bites of fleas infected by dead or dying rodents. Most people lapse into
illness within seven days after exposure.
</P>
<P>
	   Symptoms include chills and fever; painful, swollen lymph nodes in the
groin, armpit or neck; and sometimes headache, vomiting and diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Department of Health recommends that pets and people keep away
from sick or dead rodents, keep children from playing near rodent nests or
burrows and clean areas near houses where rodents could live.
</P>
<P>
	   Welsh said construction is still being done on her house, so it's easy for
mice and other critters to get in. But she won't ever again try to get rid of
rodents on her own.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The state is coming out,'' she said. ``I think they're going to
exterminate around the house.''

<HEADLINE> Energy Secretary Mulls Fuel Prices  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite soaring fuel prices and tightening supplies,
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson on Tuesday ruled out using the U.S. strategic
reserve to help ease the price spiral, which has included a sudden jump in the
cost of heating oil.
</P>
<P>
	   In a wide-ranging interview with The Associated Press, Richardson said he
hasn't decided against seeking elective office again in the future. But the
former congressman says he now prefers an ``executive-type position'' --
possibly a hint at his feelings about speculation that he could become Al Gore's
running mate.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson said while the administration is concerned about increasing oil
prices, ``the market should dictate prices'' and not government intervention.
``I do not anticipate triggering the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Those (stocks)
are used for emergencies.''
</P>
<P>
	   As Richardson spoke, President Clinton at the White House announced he would
boost heating oil assistance for low-income families under a program
administered by the Health and Human Services Department.
</P>
<P>
	   The amount of additional assistance was still being decided, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The move, aimed largely at New England where there is heavy reliance on oil
for heating, came as a winter blizzard dumped 10 to 16 inches of snow on the
Northeast -- and just a week before the critical New Hampshire presidential
primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson, in the AP interview, also said:
</P>
<P>
	   --Security at federal nuclear weapons laboratories has improved dramatically
over the past year since the firing of a scientists at the Los Alamos lab put
the spotlight on the potential for espionage.
</P>
<P>
	   --There is a possibility of summer power outages because of problems in the
power grids stemming from the electricity industry's shift from local monopolies
to competition. He urged Congress to pass an industry restructuring bill that
addresses reliability improvements.
</P>
<P>
	   --He's worried about the loss of scientists at federal research labs and he
hopes a balance between security and academic freedom will ease potential
``brain drain.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are concerned with the prices (of oil and heating oil) right now,''
Richardson said. In recent weeks he has tried to jawbone the fuel industry and
world oil producers in hopes of stopping price increases.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, oil prices are nearing $30 a barrel, after increasing $5 in a week,
from less than $12 a barrel a year ago. Heating oil prices have jumped by more
than 50 percent in recent weeks, doubling in some areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, inventories of crude oil and petroleum products such as gasoline
and heating oil have declined sharply, leading some economists to worry about
supplies.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson said he will meet with oil ministers from Saudi Arabia, Mexico,
Venezuela and other countries in coming weeks to discuss oil prices and yearlong
production curbs by producers belonging to the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials hope the production limits will ease after an upcoming OPEC
ministers meeting in March.
</P>
<P>
	   But Richardson ruled out trying to influence short-term prices by releasing
oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, more than 500 million barrels of oil
kept in salt caverns in Louisiana. The reserve is to be used to counter supply
shortages and not as ``a manipulative mechanism to deal with oil prices,'' said
Richardson.
</P>
<P>
	   While some members of Congress, especially from the Northeast, have urged
the administration to release some of the emergency oil to dampen prices, most
energy economists argue such a release would do little but prompt world
producers to further limit production.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about his political aspirations, Richardson deflected questions about
being Al Gore's running mate on a Democratic ticket. ``I don't want to limit the
vice president's flexibility. I just want to see him elected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson's name has come up in connection with a Gore ticket and the
former congressman, U.N. ambassador and now energy secretary has never dampened
the speculation. Richardson also has expressed interest in running for governor
in his home state of New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm a political politician,'' said Richardson. ``I see myself running
again, either in New Mexico or whatever.''

<HEADLINE> Candy Theft Charges Dropped Vs. Cop  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALISBURY, Md. (AP) -- Prosecutors have dropped theft charges against a
police officer accused of stealing candy and beef jerky from a convenience store
on his beat.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm pleased with the results, but it should never have gone this far,''
said Mike Davey, Officer Robert Joseph Riccio's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
	   Riccio, 32, was charged in October after a videotape showed him taking candy
and beef jerky from a 7-Eleven while he talked to a store clerk. Davey said
officers are often given food to keep them near stores.
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear why prosecutors dropped the charges Monday. Their offices
were closed Tuesday because of snow.
</P>
<P>
	   Riccio was exonerated by an internal affairs investigation but has been on
paid leave since Sept. 29.

<HEADLINE> State of Emergency Declared in N.C.  </HEADLINE>
   By ESTES THOMPSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- In this part of the country, a weather emergency
usually means a hurricane. Not 2 feet of snow.
</P>
<P>
	   But that was exactly what North Carolina got on Tuesday. A snowstorm closed
roads, knocked out power to more than a quarter-million people, and prompted
Gov. Jim Hunt to declare a state of emergency and call out the National Guard to
help clear streets and rescue stranded motorists.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There may be other snowstorms like this in Alaska or something, but never
in North Carolina,'' said Thomas Allen, whose car was buried by the snow.
</P>
<P>
	   It was North Carolina's fourth winter storm in a week, but the one with the
most punch.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor urged people to stay home and check on their neighbors. ``This
is a dangerous storm, and it should be treated as such,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Weather Service measured 2 feet of snow in Montgomery County,
where the entire county was without power, and 20 inches in Orange County. The
Raleigh-Durham airport had a record 18.2 inches.
</P>
<P>
	   Wind, snow and ice wreaked havoc on utilities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The early damage reports are devastating, with trees and power lines down
across the worst-affected areas of North and South Carolina,'' said Jeff
Corbett, Carolina Power &AMP; Light storm coordinator. ``We are seeing
hurricane-like damage.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Wake County, one of the hardest hit, emergency medical services were
delayed up to an hour by the deep snow.
</P>
<P>
	   Shelters were opened in several counties.
</P>
<P>
	   But on one of the best sledding hills in Charlotte, behind St. Patrick's
Cathedral, Donna Lampke enjoyed every bit of the snow with her sons, Peter, 6,
and Jake, 4.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I just took the red eye in from California yesterday morning and I was
feeling sorry for myself because I thought I missed the big snowstorm of 2000,''
she said as the boys flew down the steep hill on their sleds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I woke up to this,'' she said. ``I'm ecstatic, total bliss.''
</P>
<P>
	   Niki Dewberry, 3, got to make her first snowman with her dad, Darryl.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We used Oreos for the eyes and a carrot for the nose,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Rejects U.S. Request  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHY GANNON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Afghanistan's ruling Taliban and Pakistan's
military leaders have rebuffed U.S. appeals to crack down on terrorism, and one
militant group warned Tuesday of a violent backlash if they tried.
</P>
<P>
	   On a visit to the region last week, a top American envoy urged the outlawing
of a group blamed for hijacking an Indian plane last month and that steps also
be taken to bring terror suspect Osama bin Laden to justice.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan did not agree to any specific actions. India charges that Pakistan
had a hand in the hijacking, a claim that the United States has rejected. And in
neighboring Afghanistan, Taliban leaders have refused to hand over bin Laden,
charged in the United States with masterminding the deadly bombings of U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Of particular concern to the United States is Harkat ul-Mujahedeen, the
successor to a Pakistani-based organization that has been declared a terrorist
group by Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for a sister organization, Harkat ul-Jehad, warned of violence
if the government tried to close the group's offices in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will not hesitate to take any action and believe me there will be a
free-for-all here in Pakistan. It will be anarchy,'' Abu Mahmood Ashraf said. He
added that his group trains in Pakistan and Afghanistan to fight in Kashmir --
the flashpoint of two wars between India and Pakistan -- and ``in other Muslim
countries where Muslims are being attacked.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ashraf also called bin Laden a hero to Muslims worldwide. ``Any injury or
his death would be a great shock to us and we would not stop until we have
severely punished the United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   India accuses Harkat ul-Mujahedeen of staging the Indian Airlines hijacking
that ended with 155 hostages freed in exchange for the Indian government's
release of three members of the group.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton said Tuesday there was no evidence that Pakistan supported
the hijacking, which Pakistan strongly condemned again on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The government of Pakistan regards the highjacking as abhorrent and is
commited to prosecute any person or persons found and apprended on our
territory, or in Kashmir, who may be suspected of havng committed that crime. If
they are convicted they will be subject to the death penalty,'' a spokesman for
Pakistan's foreign ministry said.
</P>
<P>
	   But State Department spokesman James P. Rubin cited concerns for some time
``that agencies of the Pakistani government have provided general support to a
number of groups operating in Kashmir, including Harkat ul-Mujahedeen.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth discussed terrorism
concerns last week when he met ruling Gen. Pervez Musharraf and other leaders of
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We hope that the government of Pakistan will take steps against such
extremist groups which carry out acts of violence inside Pakistan, as well as in
the region,'' Inderfurth said, specifically naming Harkat ul-Mujahedeen.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan did not promise to crack down on such groups. What Inderfurth got
was a statement sharing Washington's concern about terrorism.
</P>
<P>
	   Two days before the Oct. 12 military coup that ended civilian rule in
Pakistan, then-Interior Minister Shujaat Hussein told The Associated Press that
militant Islamic groups were created by Pakistan, its military and its
intelligence agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Hussein said his government had asked the Taliban to shut down camps in
Afghanistan, where Pakistanis were receiving military training. While publicly
denying the existence of these camps, Hussein said the Taliban privately
promised Pakistan to close them.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States also has asked Pakistan, one of only three countries to
recognize the Taliban, to use its influence against bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
	   Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil, the Taliban's foreign minister, said Monday that bin
Laden won't be extradited or handed over to the United States or a third country
for trial. Taliban leaders had met with Inderfurth, but of further discussions
with the United States, Muttawakil said ``we don't want to talk to them.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-La. Governor's Trial Opens  </HEADLINE>
   By NATALIE GOTT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Former Gov. Edwin Edwards, who has long delighted
in matching wits with prosecutors, went on trial on corruption charges Tuesday,
with the government saying this time it has him on video handing over a roll of
cash.
</P>
<P>
	   The colorful Edwards -- a high-rolling gambler and ladies' man with a kind
of rogue charm that plays well in New Orleans -- is charged along with his son
and five other people in a scheme to extort millions in payoffs from applicants
for riverboat casino licenses.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards, 72, could get up to 350 years in prison and $7.2 million in fines.
</P>
<P>
	   It is the third time in 40 years of public life that the four-term governor
has found himself sitting at the defense table. He was indicted by federal
prosecutors during his third term in 1985 in a health care investment scheme.
The first trial ended in a hung jury, the second in his acquittal.
</P>
<P>
	   By his own count, Edwards has been the subject of almost two dozen state or
federal investigations going back to his days as a congressman in the 1960s. He
was governor on and off during the 1970s, '80s and 90s.
</P>
<P>
	   This time, the trial centers on one of his favorite activities -- gambling.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You will see Edwin Edwards hand a roll of cash'' to former Rep. Cleo
Fields, prosecutor Jim Letten told the jury in opening statements.
</P>
<P>
	   On the secretly made tape, Fields asks for a piece of paper and a rubber
band to secure the roll of cash Edwards hands him, Letten said. Edwards
admonishes him to be careful because ``that guy is under serious, serious,
serious investigation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Letten said the ``guy'' was state Sen. Greg Tarver, who is among those on
trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Fields is not charged with any wrongdoing. His attorney, Mike Small,
declined comment, citing a court gag order, but said that Fields was never a
target of the federal probe.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards lawyer Daniel Small likened the prosecution's case to one of his
children's jigsaw puzzles with missing pieces. ``You cannot convict someone of a
crime as serious as this on bits and pieces,'' he told the jury.
</P>
<P>
	   Bolstering his claim that extortion did indeed take place, Letten said one
alleged victim, former casino owner Robert Guidry, was so incensed at having to
make monthly $100,000 payments that he began putting the money in garbage bins.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He made sure they would have to soil themselves to get the money,'' Letten
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Guidry has pleaded guilty to funneling money to Edwards and may be a
prosecution witness.

<HEADLINE> Exxon Mobil Earnings Rise 34 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Higher oil prices helped push Exxon Mobil Corp.'s
fourth-quarter earnings up nearly 34 percent and ahead of Wall Street
expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   The oil company said Tuesday its net operating income was $2.71 billion, or
77 cents a share, 2 cents better than the 75 cents expected by analysts surveyed
by First Call/Thomson Financial. Earnings a year earlier were $2.03 billion, or
58 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Including expenses related to last year's merger between Exxon and Mobil,
net income was $2.28 billion, or 65 cents a share, compared with $1.38 billion,
or 39 cents a share in the final quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourth-quarter revenue increased 30 percent to $55.96 billion from $43.14
billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Exxon Mobil fell 18 3/4 cents to $84.06 1/4 in trading at 5:15
p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Exxon Mobil chairman Lee Raymond said exploration and production results
benefited from the continued rise in crude oil prices, which averaged more than
$24 a barrel in the fourth quarter -- about $12 higher than a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   The same trend, however, depressed Exxon Mobil's refining and marketing
revenues because the company couldn't raise product prices in line with rising
crude oil prices, he said. As a result, refining and marketing lost money in the
quarter, Raymond said.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, the company said net income excluding special items was $8.38
billion, or $2.38 a share, compared with $8.81 billion, or $2.49 a share in
1998. Including merger-related expenses and special items, net income for 1999
was $7.91 billion, or $2.25 a share, compared with $8.07 billion, or $2.28 a
share, in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue was $186.91 billion, up 10 percent from $169.64 billion.

<HEADLINE> Xerox Profits Fall 52 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Xerox Corp. reported Tuesday its profits fell 52
percent in the fourth quarter as it struggled with increased competition and
sales that were diminished by Y2K anxiety. The company said it was pursuing
cost-cutting steps but did not say what they might be.
</P>
<P>
	   Net income in the October-December period was $294 million, or 41 cents per
share, compared with $615 million, or 84 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected earnings of 40 cents.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues in the quarter fell 6 percent to $5.44 billion from $5.79 billion a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The company had warned last month that its earnings, which fell 11 percent
in the third quarter, would drop again in the fourth. It said Tuesday it
probably will see a similar decline in earnings in the first quarter and a
smaller decline in the second before earnings start rising again.
</P>
<P>
	   In a conference call with industry analysts Xerox president Rick Thoman said
the company would look for efficiencies and cost-savings steps and may take a
charge of "hundreds of millions of dollars" in the first quarter of this year.
Thoman, who called the fourth-quarter results a major disappointment, said
"virtually everything is on the table" to get costs down.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Xerox rose 18 3/4 cents to $21.93 3/4 in trading at 5:15 p.m. on
the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said that in addition to Year 2000 computer fears, its results
were hurt by reduced earnings from Brazil, its own customer administration
reorganization and unfavorable currency exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, net income from continuing operations fell 16 percent to
$1.42 billion, or $1.96 a share, from $1.69 billion, or $2.33 a share, in 1998.
Including special items, such as a restructuring charge of $1.11 billion, net
income in 1998 was $395 million, or 52 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues fell 1 percent to $19.23 billion from $19.45 billion in 1998.

<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Two teen-agers must spend at least a year in custody for
leading a plot to conduct a Columbine-style massacre a high school, while two
accomplices must be held for at least six months, a judge ruled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Each of the boys could be held until age 21, the maximum penalty under state
juvenile law, depending on his behavior.
</P>
<P>
	   Plot ringleaders Andy Napier, 15, and Benjamin Balducci, 16, pleaded guilty
to conspiracy to commit murder.
</P>
<P>
	   Adam Gruber, 14, and John Borowski, 15, pleaded guilty to inducing panic and

</P>
<P>
	   The plot was discovered when a student tipped off South High School
officials that the teen-agers planned to open fire on Oct. 29, the day of the
school's homecoming dance and football game.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities closed the school for a day. While police found no weapons or
bombs in the building, they confiscated a total of eight guns from two of the
suspects' houses.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said the youths wanted to carry out the attack because they felt
alienated from their classmates.

<HEADLINE> MidEast Peace Talks in Stalemate  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE COPANS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- With only three weeks to go before a crucial deadline in
the peace talks, Israel and the Palestinians accused one another Tuesday of not
taking the process seriously.
</P>
<P>
	   The sides had set Feb. 13 as a deadline for creating the outline of an
agreement on the thorniest issues between them, including borders, Palestinian
refugees, Jewish settlers and the fate of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
	   But Palestinian negotiator Ahmed Qureia said that after 21 meetings on the
final status talks, nothing had been achieved and it was unlikely the sides
would meet the deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe it is because the Israelis are still hesitant to proceed
seriously and to empower the delegation,'' Qureia said. Lead Israeli negotiator
Oded Eran has also said meeting the Feb. 13 deadline is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
	   Hoping to spur the peace talks, the Palestinians had proposed a summit in
Davos, Switzerland this weekend. The summit was to include Prime Minister Ehud
Barak, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and President Clinton, but the event
appeared unlikely to take place late Tuesday because Barak has all but rejected
the idea and Clinton never expressed any interest in it.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinians blamed Israel for what they called the summit's collapse,
saying Barak was ``hesitant.'' That provoked a strong reaction from Barak's
office, which said that the summit was never seriously considered.
</P>
<P>
	   The prime minister has not yet ruled out traveling to Davos but preferred
that disputes between the sides be settled on home turf, said his spokesman Gadi
Baltiansky.
</P>
<P>
	   Blaming Barak for the collapse of the summit ``does not demonstrate the
seriousness needed to ensure the success of the negotiations,'' Baltiansky said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinians want intensive U.S. involvement in the process, believing that
Clinton's eagerness for a rapid resolution will lead him to pressure Barak into
coming around to some Palestinian demands.
</P>
<P>
	   In another sign the talks were in trouble, Arafat said he would declare a
Palestinian state this year even if differences with Israel have not been worked
out.
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat has throughout the peace process used a the threat of a unilateral
declaration of statehood to press Israel into accelerating talks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This year is the year of the Palestinian state,'' Arafat said in the Gaza
Strip as he returned from talks in Cairo with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
	   Senior Palestinian Liberation Organization officials warned earlier this
month that a statehood declaration could conceivably come as early as Feb. 2,
when the PLO's policy-making Central Council meets.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Arafat said Palestinian statehood would be ``one of the main
issues'' at that meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak has not objected to Palestinian statehood, but Israeli opponents to
the peace process would likely use a unilateral statehood declaration as proof
that the prime minister had lost control of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Tuesday, 5,000 protesters rallied against the Palestinians getting any
part of Jerusalem as part of any permanent peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak has pledged to keep the city undivided, but ministers close to the
prime minister have suggested that three Arab suburbs of Jerusalem could
eventually become the Palestinian capital.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We came to demonstrate to our fellow Jews that the government is selling
Jerusalem,'' said Moshe Cohen, 47, a protester who lives in a West Bank
settlement. ``This signifies the extinction of Zionism.''

<HEADLINE> Procter &AMP; Gamble's Earnings Flat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CINCINNATI (AP) -- Procter &AMP; Gamble Co., a day after deciding against a bid
for drug makers Warner-Lambert and American Home Products, reported
second-quarter earnings that were little changed from a year earlier but that
beat Wall Street expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   P&AMP;G said Tuesday its earnings totaled $1.13 billion, or 78 cents per share,
in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with $1.14 billion, or 78 cents per
share, in the same period last year. When costs of P&AMP;G's ongoing corporate
restructuring are excluded, earnings were $1.3 billion, or 88 cents per share,
matching the prediction of securities analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson
Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales rose 7 percent to $10.59 billion from $9.93 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Management said the restructuring, intended to reduce internal bureaucracy
and get new products to market more quickly, helped P&AMP;G achieve its largest
quarterly sales increase since 1997. Unfavorable currency exchange rates reduced
sales by 2 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   For the first six months of P&AMP;G's fiscal year, earnings totaled $2.27
billion, or $1.58 per share, on sales of $20.5 billion, compared with $2.31
billion, or $1.58 per share, on sales of $19.4 billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Excluding the restructuring costs, P&AMP;G earned $2.53 billion and $1.76 per
share in the quarter ended Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cincinnati-based company, whose products include Tide detergent and
Pampers diapers, abandoned negotiations Monday to expand its prescription drug
business by acquiring Warner-Lambert and American Home Products.
</P>
<P>
	   News reports about Procter &AMP; Gamble's discussions to buy the drug companies
for more than $140 billion in stock alarmed investors and sent P&AMP;G's shares down
almost 20 percent in four days, making any potential deal much more expensive
for P&AMP;G shareholders. Durk Jager, P&AMP;G's chairman and chief executive, said
speculation about the deal had made it difficult to continue the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   P&AMP;G said that while it still is in the market for an acquisition, it no
longer would be looking at drug companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Procter &AMP; Gamble fell $5.37 1/2, or 5 percent, to $97.50 in
trading Tuesday at 5:15 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Steel Group Reports Earnings Drop  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Blaming a decline in steel prices due to overseas
competition, USX-U.S. Steel Group reported a 55 percent decline in earnings in
the fourth quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Without adjusting for nonrecurring items, net income was $34 million, or 35
cents a share, compared to $76 million, or 81 cents a share, in the fourth
quarter in 1998, USX reported Monday. Adjusting for those items -- including a
higher-than-expected foreign tax assessment -- net income for the fourth quarter
was $39 million, or 42 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourth quarter sales rose 7.7 percent to $1.46 billion from $1.36 billion in
the same quarter a year ago, the company reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts had predicted 43 cents per share in the quarter, according to
Zack's Investment Research. Consensus analyst estimates from First Call was 41
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   "More or less, it was in line with expectations," said Richard Aldrich, an
analyst with Lehman Brothers. "It looks like, if you back out the nonrecurring
items, they would break even in the steel segment, which was a little bit worse
than expected."
</P>
<P>
	   USX Corp. board chairman Thomas J. Usher noted that operating rates improved
and shipments increased more than 20 percent in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Shipments for the fourth quarter were 2.86 million net tons, up 22 percent
from 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Raw steel capability utilization in the fourth quarter was 97 percent, up
significantly from 76 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, net income was $44 million, or 40 cents per share, down 88
percent from $364 million, or $3.92 per share, in 1998. But 1999 sales dropped
15.5 percent to $5.31 billion from $6.28 billion for all of 1998, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1999 figure does not take into account an after-tax charge of $39
million, or 44 cents per share, associated with USX's investment in USS/Kobe
Steel Co. and costs related to the formation of Republic Technologies LLC. USX
Corp. completed its purchase of Kobe Steel's 50 percent interest in Lorain
Tubular Co. in Ohio late last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of USX rose 31 1/4 cents to $26.50 in trading Tuesday at 5:15 p.m. on
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Eyes Debt Payment by 2013  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Virtually doubling the size of the budget battlefield
this election year, the Congressional Budget Office said Tuesday that it now
expects federal surpluses over the next decade to total as much as a gigantic
$1.9 trillion.
</P>
<P>
	   With the soaring economy pouring billions in unforeseen revenue into federal
coffers, President Clinton said he will propose paying off the government's
entire $3.6 trillion federally held debt by 2013. That would be two years
earlier than he has previously aimed for, and puts him a step ahead of House
Republicans, who are working on a plan to pay off that portion of the debt by
2015.
</P>
<P>
	   The surplus estimate by CBO, for the 10 years ending 2010, represents a near
doubling of a $1 trillion forecast it issued only last July. The figures exclude
Social Security funds.
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides immediately claimed credit for the good news.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We got here by making hard choices and sticking to a strategy that works,
that builds opportunity and reinforces responsibility,'' Clinton said at the
White House. ``I remain committed to that strategy. I ask the Republican
majority in Congress to put politics aside and join me.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a written statement, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said, ``We
have this surplus because of the hard work of the American people, because of
the healthy American economy and because of prudent fiscal policies championed
by the Republican Congress.''
</P>
<P>
	   The ballooning surplus estimates by CBO, Congress' nonpartisan budget
analyst, mean there will be even more money at stake this election year as both
parties' presidential candidates, as well as Clinton and Congress, battle over
how much of it to use for possible tax cuts, spending increases and debt
reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the politicians for whom the forecast was good news is GOP
presidential contender George W. Bush, who has proposed a five-year, $483
billion tax cut that could be paid for by the new numbers. Some, including
Republican candidate Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., have said Bush's plan eats up
too much of the projected surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of likely political gridlock on issues this year, many analysts
expect most of the surplus for fiscal 2001 -- which begins next Oct. 1 -- to go
for debt reduction. CBO projected next year's surplus at up to $69 billion, plus
$166 billion in Social Security surpluses.
</P>
<P>
	   In testimony prepared for delivery Wednesday to the Senate Budget Committee,
CBO Director Dan Crippen said the projections were based on ``the midrange of
possible outcomes for the economy and the budget.'' The actual surplus for 2010
-- which CBO estimated at up to $703 billion, including Social Security -- could
be up to $800 billion higher or lower, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton provided no details about how he would eliminate the publicly held
debt, which is money the government owes investors who hold Treasury bonds,
bills and notes. The remaining $2 trillion of the $5.7 trillion national debt is
money held by the Social Security and other trust funds.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said his plan, to be included in the fiscal 2001 budget he releases
Feb. 7, will devote interest savings to Social Security, extending its solvency
beyond 2050. It will also seek to ensure Medicare's survival until at least
2025, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Taking a swipe at Republicans, the president said the national debt is $1.7
trillion less this year than was projected when he took office in 1993, despite
``repeated efforts to push us off the path of fiscal discipline with large and
irresponsible tax cuts.''
</P>
<P>
	   But GOP lawmakers scoffed at his plan, noting that he has already revealed
dozens of budget proposals that will cost tens of billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you're spiritual, it seems kind of miraculous'' that he can eliminate
the debt and boost spending, said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete
Domenici, R-N.M. ``If you're not, it sounds kind of magic.''
</P>
<P>
	   The new CBO figures were greeted with proclamations of victory by
Republicans, who had promised to not touch Social Security funds when they
finished writing this year's spending bills in the fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Though final figures for fiscal 2000 won't be known until Sept. 30, CBO
projected that there will be a $23 billion surplus this year without using
Social Security's own hefty surpluses.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional Democrats, however, said CBO's $1.9 trillion, 10-year surplus
estimates were unrealistic, because they assume that spending will be far lower
than is likely to actually occur.
</P>
<P>
	   Highlighting the political pressure it faced from both parties, CBO issued
three surplus forecasts, an unusual step for the agency. Two were for 10-year
surpluses of about $1.9 trillion, the other estimated $838 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats said the lower forecast was most accurate because it assumes
spending will grow enough to keep up with inflation every year for the one-third
of the $1.7 trillion budget Congress must approve annually. Those programs --
which include everything but automatically paid benefits like Social Security --
have grown at roughly that rate in recent years.
</P>
<P>
	   CBO projected a 10-year, $1.92 trillion surplus if spending limits
controlling that one-third of the budget are obeyed. They have been ignored the
last two years and are certain to be ignored again this year.
</P>
<P>
	   CBO also forecasts a $1.86 trillion, 10-year surplus if the approximately
$600 billion controlled by the spending limits is kept roughly the same for the
entire decade. Republicans are leaning toward using something like this
estimate.
</P>
<P>
	   Including Social Security's surpluses, the budget agency projected that over
the decade, federal black ink would total as much as $4.23 trillion.

<HEADLINE> Raytheon's Earnings Drop 79 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LEXINGTON, Mass. (AP) -- Raytheon Co. said Tuesday its fourth-quarter
earnings plunged 79 percent, a drop larger than Wall Street analysts had
projected for the defense contractor.
</P>
<P>
	   The company blamed a decline in revenue on lower missile shipments as well
as aircraft production delays and accounting changes mandated by the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   Net income was $72 million, or 21 cents a share, in the October-December
period, down from $341 million, or $1 per share, a year earlier. Analysts
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had predicted earnings of 22 cents a
share.
</P>
<P>
	   Raytheon said that accounting changes to bring it in compliance with SEC
rules resulted in fourth-quarter costs of 11 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue was $4.83 billion, down 8 percent from $5.26 billion the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
	   Raytheon last week warned investors that fourth-quarter earnings would be
lower than projected for the second straight quarter. The warning came after the
company announced plans in November to eliminate its biggest division, Raytheon
Systems Co., streamline management, and revise the way financial information is
shared within the company.
</P>
<P>
	   Class B shares in Raytheon rose $1.68, or 9 percent, to $20 in trading at
5:15 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange. Class A shares rose $1.56, or 8.5
percent, to $19.87 1/2.
</P>
<P>
	   Net income for the year was $404 million, or $1.19 a share, compared with
$844 million, or $2.47 a share, in 1998. Excluding a $53 million accounting
charge, net income in 1999 was $457 million, or $1.34 a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue for the year was $19.84 billion, up 2 percent from $19.42 billion in
1998. The company said the increase reflected stronger sales in missile defense
systems and some improvement in the power business of Raytheon Engineers &AMP;
Constructors.

<HEADLINE> Storm Dumps Foot of Snow in East  </HEADLINE>
   By ROGER PETTERSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   A surprisingly fast-moving storm blanketed the East Coast with up to 2 feet
of wind-blown snow Tuesday, closing airports and schools, paralyzing the
nation's capital and leaving North Carolina looking more like North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The snow has completely covered my car. It's gone, I can't even see it,''
Thomas Allen said in Raleigh, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   At least four people were killed in weather-related traffic accidents in the
Carolinas, and a 5-year-old girl was missing and feared dead in Massachusetts
after falling into an icy river while walking to school in heavy snow.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm even intruded on the presidential campaign. Most of the candidates
flew to New Hampshire after the Iowa caucuses, but Republican Alan Keyes got
stuck in Detroit, unable to fly into Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm -- known as a nor'easter -- drove northward along the coast, with
moist air from the ocean colliding with cold air over the land. During the
morning, snow fell from South Carolina all the way to Maine.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm raced into the Northeast with a speed that surprised forecasters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We knew it was coming. It just decided to hit us a day earlier,'' said
National Weather Service meteorologist Tim Morrin in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the third snowfall in a week for some states, but for much of the
region it was the first major storm in a season that has seen little snow. It
was also the worst snowstorm to hit the area since the blizzard of January 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Most federal agencies shut down in Washington. Legislative meetings were
called off in Delaware, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania, and Delaware Gov. Thomas
Carper had to postpone his State of the State address for the second time in a
week because of snow.
</P>
<P>
	   Schools were closed from South Carolina to Maine, including nearly all
schools in New Jersey and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourteen inches of snow had fallen by early afternoon at Petersburg, Va.,
and snow piled up in 4- to 5-foot drifts outside Richmond. A foot had fallen at
Jaffrey, N.H. The Baltimore-Washington International Airport got more than seven
inches. Ten inches had accumulated outside Philadelphia at King of Prussia, and
New York City measured 6.
</P>
<P>
	   Boston had only 3 1/2 inches, but snow up to 18 inches deep was forecast by
the end of the storm in the Berkshire hills of western Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm hit hardest in the Carolinas. North Carolina got 2 feet of snow in
Montgomery County and a record 18 inches at the Raleigh-Durham airport.
</P>
<P>
	   The North Carolina utility CP&AMP;L had 142,000 customers without power, Duke
Power Co. reported 120,000 without power in North and South Carolina, and the
storm stalled repairs. Virginia Power reported 5,600 customers without power,
mostly in Virginia Beach, where ice was more of a problem than snow.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With wind gusts at 40 miles per hour, it's just not safe to have somebody
up there working on a power line in a bucket truck,'' said CP&AMP;L spokeswoman
Sally Ramey.
</P>
<P>
	   North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt declared a state of emergency, activating the
National Guard to help clear streets and rescue stranded motorists. Stalled cars
and trucks shut down five miles of Interstate 85.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There may be other snowstorms like this in Alaska or something, but never
in North Carolina,'' said Allen, the motorist whose car was buried in Raleigh,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm closed major Eastern airports, including New York's LaGuardia and
Washington Reagan National Airport, and others had delays and cancellations. US
Airways canceled all of its afternoon East Coast service between North Carolina
and New York.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think we didn't pick the best day for flying,'' Brazilian visitor Joao
Nemeth said at LaGuardia as he comforted an 11-year-old daughter who had
expected to fly to Walt Disney World.
</P>
<P>
	   A memorial service scheduled Tuesday in New Jersey at Seton Hall University
for three freshmen killed in a dormitory fire last week had to be rescheduled
because of the snow.
</P>
<P>
	   A few people appreciated the snow.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It adds beauty to this place,'' Rudolph Williams said in New York City.
``It adds life. It's creative. This here is a winter's work of art!''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Clears Pakistan in Hijacking  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Tuesday that there is no evidence
Pakistan supported the hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane last month.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the hijackers may have been linked to a terrorist group that
operates in Kashmir -- a territory disputed by Pakistan and India -- according
to the State Department.
</P>
<P>
	   The group, known as Harkat ul-Mujahedeen, was placed on the department's
list of terrorist organizations in 1997 when it was called Harkat ul-Ansar.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department's coordinator for counter terrorism, Michael Sheehan,
and other senior administration officials have conveyed their concern to the
Pakistani government about possible ties to the hijacking group and also concern
about training of terrorists in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   The anxious hijacking incident ended with 155 hostages freed in exchange for
the Indian government's release of three members of the group.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, responding to a published report that implicated the Pakistani
government, said at the White House: ``We don't have any evidence that the
Pakistani government was involved in that hijacking.''
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said, meanwhile, ``we have no
reason to believe that the government of Pakistan had foreknowledge, supported
or helped carry out'' the hijacking.
</P>
<P>
	   Consequences for Pakistan, had the country been implicated, could have
included being placed on the State Department's list of countries that sponsor
terrorism. The seven countries on that list are ineligible for virtually all
U.S. assistance and for American support in international lending institutions.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton and his senior advisers are weighing a decision whether he should
visit Pakistan in March on a planned trip to India and Bangladesh. Normally, a
stop in Pakistan would be in order diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
	   But the military takeover of Pakistan by Gen. Pervez Musharraf last October
has prompted an internal debate within the administration.
</P>
<P>
	   A decision is expected soon.
</P>
<P>
	   Because Pakistan has friendly relations with the Taliban government in
Afghanistan, Musharraf could play a helpful role in U.S. efforts to force the
expulsion from Afghanistan of Osama bin Laden, accused by the United States of
operating a terrorism network that arranged for the bombing of U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, relations between India and Pakistan have soured again, and the
familiar concern in Washington is heightened by the fact that both have achieved
nuclear weapons capability.
</P>
<P>
	   India has accused Pakistan of masterminding the hijacking.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department's Rubin said: ``We have been concerned for some time
about the fact that agencies of the Pakistani government have provided general
support to a number of groups operating in Kashmir, including Harkat
ul-Mujahedeen,'' And, he said, ``We also have reason to believe that the
hijackers were affiliated with the Harkat ul-Mujahedeen.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lanny Davis, an attorney representing Pakistan in Washington, denounced the
Indian government accusations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The big lie technique cynically used by the government of India falsely
and without any evidence suggesting that the government of Pakistan was involved
in the hijacking or sympathetic with the hijacking is reprehensible,'' said
Davis. ``They have refused to present any evidence because they have none and we
are grateful that the U.S. government today has rejected those scurrilous
charges,'' he added.

<HEADLINE> Church of England Mulls Remarriage  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BARR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- The Church of England, established by the much-wedded King
Henry VIII, took a step Tuesday toward approving remarriage for divorcees -- an
issue that may be of keen interest to Britain's next king.
</P>
<P>
	   Recommendations published by a group of bishops, if adopted by the church's
governing General Synod in 2002, could make it easier for Prince Charles to
contemplate marriage to his longtime love, Camilla Parker Bowles.
</P>
<P>
	   But the church's main concern is dealing with the realities of a nation with
one of the highest divorce rates in Europe. Roughly one-third of Anglican
priests already remarry divorcees, and the church says 10 percent of its
marriages now involve divorcees.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If these proposals win acceptance, the church will not simply marry anyone
who turns up and asks to be married,'' said the Right Rev. Michael Scott-Joynt,
bishop of Winchester and chairman of the bishops' working party on remarriage.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the conditions: Divorced people should be honest about the reasons for
the failure of their previous marriage, adequate provision should be made for
supporting children, the new relationship should not be the cause of breaking up
the previous marriage, and ``a reasonable time'' should have passed since the
divorce.
</P>
<P>
	   Bishops also recommended that remarriage should normally not be permitted
for people who have been involved in more than one divorce.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision in each case would be made by the local priest in consultation
with the bishop. The recommendations say that no priest should be compelled to
preside at a remarriage against his or her conscience.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This report in effect codifies what has already become practice in many
parishes,'' said the Right Rev. Mark Santer, bishop of Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposals would have to be approved by two-thirds majorities in all
three houses of the General Synod -- bishops, clergy and lay members.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1981, the General Synod adopted a resolution affirming its belief that
``marriage should always be undertaken as a lifelong commitment,'' but noted
that circumstances exist in which it would be right for a divorced person to
remarry in church while the former partner remains alive.
</P>
<P>
	   At a news conference announcing the recommendations, church officials
refused to be drawn into comment on the case of Prince Charles, who is next in
line to succeed Queen Elizabeth II as monarch and temporal head of the church.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles, who has been free to remarry since former wife Princess Diana died
in a 1997 car crash, has said he has no intention of doing so.
</P>
<P>
	   He has acknowledged adultery with Mrs. Parker Bowles while they each were
still married. Diana blamed Mrs. Parker Bowles for the dissolution of her
marriage, but Charles has said he was faithful to Diana until their marriage
broke down.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly 40 percent of marriages in England and Wales end in divorce -- one of
the highest rates in Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   The church, which broke from Rome because of King Henry VIII's wish to be
freed of his first wife, has officially barred second weddings in church for
divorcees since the 17th century.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1955, the queen's sister, Princess Margaret, decided against marrying the
man she loved, Group Capt. Peter Townsend, because he was divorced. The queen's
uncle, Edward VIII, abdicated in 1936 to marry a twice-divorced American, Wallis
Simpson.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles' divorced sister, Princess Anne, married her second husband in the
Church of Scotland, a Presbyterian church that is not part of the Anglican
Communion.
</P>
<P>
	   The bishops' recommendation applies only to churches in England. Other
Anglican churches around the world are free to set their own policy, as they
have done on the issue of ordaining women. In the United States, for instance,
the Episcopal Church has long performed marriages for divorced members with few
restrictions.

<HEADLINE> Future Uncertain for Uranium Plants  </HEADLINE>
   By NANCY ZUCKERBROD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The company that owns and operates the nation's only two
uranium enrichment plants is considering cutting jobs and closing one of the
facilities, a spokeswoman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Falling prices for enriched uranium, used to fuel nuclear power plants, and
increased production costs prompted directors of U.S. Enrichment Corp. to
discuss cost-cutting options at a meeting Tuesday at an undisclosed
Washington-area location.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The board discussed company initiatives and cost-cutting reviews,'' said
USEC spokeswoman Elizabeth Stuckle.
</P>
<P>
	   Cost-cutting measures the company has considered in the past few months have
included possible layoffs or the eventual closing of a gaseous diffusion plant,
either in Paducah, Ky., or in Portsmouth, Ohio, Stuckle said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Neither of those decisions have been made as of yet,'' she said, adding
the directors plan to meet again next week.
</P>
<P>
	   Bethesda, Md.-based USEC was a government entity created to enrich uranium
for commercial nuclear plants. It was privatized in 1998 to better compete in a
global market.
</P>
<P>
	   USEC officials say while the company is profitable, it is losing money on a
contract to sell enriched uranium from Russia to utility companies worldwide.
The deal was set up by the U.S. government to keep Soviet-era warhead uranium
away from rogue nations and terrorists.
</P>
<P>
	   USEC asked the federal government in December to compensate the company for
up to $200 million lost on the Russian deal, but the government declined.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our industry is paying for world peace,'' said Dan Minter, president of
the Piketon, Ohio, chapter of the Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy
Workers International Union, which represents Portsmouth plant workers.
</P>
<P>
	   USEC employs about 2,100 people in Portsmouth and 1,700 in Paducah. The
company laid off 250 workers at each plant last year. Any additional layoffs
also would be divided between the two plants, Stuckle said.
</P>
<P>
	   Minter said employees did not know the board was considering layoffs or a
plant closing. He said the union is adopting a wait-and-see attitude.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't want to plan for the funerals until we have to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Miller, a Washington policy analyst for the workers' union, said the
layoffs or a plant closure would be devastating to both communities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It may be time for the government to reevaluate whether it should buy USEC
back,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
	   The House Commerce Committee has been investigating a variety of issues
stemming from the privatization of USEC. Chairman J. Thomas Bliley Jr., R-Va.,
has said he would schedule hearings early this year, but no date has been set.

<HEADLINE> Two Broadway Plays Announce Close  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- "Wrong Mountain," the one new play currently on Broadway,
will close Feb. 5 after a run of less than a month and a loss of more than $1.5
million.
</P>
<P>
	   The comedy by David Hirson about a cranky poet who writes a play will have
had 28 performances. "Wrong Mountain" opened Jan. 13 to largely negative
reviews, although it had fierce supporters. Many of them also championed
Hirson's previous Broadway effort, "La Bete," which also had a short New York
run.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Price," a revival of the 1968 Arthur Miller drama, also has put up a
closing notice. The production ends a money-losing, nearly four-month engagement
March 5. Its theater, the Royale, already has been booked with the highly
anticipated "Copenhagen" by Michael Frayn. The play, which stars Philip Bosco,
Blair Brown and Michael Cumpsty, has been a success in London. It opens in New
York on April 11.

<HEADLINE> Chief Prosecutor in Waco Resigns  </HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN PARROTT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WACO, Texas (AP) -- The federal prosecutor who warned Attorney General Janet
Reno of a possible government cover-up after the 1993 Branch Davidian siege
resigned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Johnston, whose willingness to re-examine
evidence from the deadly standoff touched off a re-investigation of the
government's actions, handed in his resignation to his boss, U.S. Attorney James
Blagg in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnston, 40, acknowledged mounting frustration with Justice officials, whom
he called ``less than forthright.'' And he said his job had been awkward ever
since he wrote Reno last August.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Any time you are at odds with someone who is your boss, it is difficult to
even have conversation. You just avoid one another,'' Johnston said Tuesday
during an interview with The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnston, the chief federal prosecutor in Waco, has been at odds with
Justice officials since he paved the way last year for independent filmmakers to
review evidence sifted from the charred ruins of the Davidians' compound.
</P>
<P>
	   Filmmaker Michael McNulty's discovery of a spent pyrotechnic tear gas
canister forced the FBI to recant its longstanding denials that potentially
incendiary devices were fired on April 19, 1993, when Branch Davidian leader
David Koresh and about 80 followers died in a fire at their compound.
</P>
<P>
	   The FBI's about-face has triggered investigations by Congress and a special
counsel appointed by Reno.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnston's tension with his superiors was heightened in August, when he
wrote Reno that government lawyers had known for years about the use of
pyrotechnic tear-gas canisters, which were fired hours before the Davidians'
compound erupted in flames.
</P>
<P>
	   Ten days after he wrote the letter, Johnston was abruptly pulled from the
case, as was Blagg's entire office.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I wasn't going to be a party to misleading the American public about this
issue, when I full well knew the import of it,'' Johnston told CBS' ''60 Minutes
II'' in an interview airing Tuesday night. ``We cannot hide the ball, in
criminal or civil cases, and feel good about it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Johnston's resignation was lamented Tuesday on Capitol Hill, where
congressional committees are probing whether a government cover-up occurred in
the Waco operation's aftermath. They also are investigating the military's role
during the standoff and whether federal forces discharged their weapons on April
19, 1993 -- a contention strongly denied by federal officials.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're sorry that there doesn't seem to be a place for good, hardworking,
honest public servants like Bill Johnston in this Justice Department,'' said
Mark Corallo, a spokesman for House Government Reform Committee Chairman Dan
Burton, R-Ind., who has been critical of Reno and the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnston's involvement in the Branch Davidian controversy dates to its
earliest days.
</P>
<P>
	   He helped draft the search warrant that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms attempted to execute on Feb. 28, 1993, in a botched raid that sparked
the 51-day standoff at the Davidians' retreat. Johnston later helped convict
nine Davidians during their criminal trial.

<HEADLINE> 'Southern Living' Founder Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Emory O. Cunningham, who introduced the nation to
Old South favorites like cheese grits and magnolias by founding Southern Living
magazine, has died. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
	   Cunningham, a native of Alabama, died Monday. He began a magazine about
Southern hospitality in the 1960s amid the civil rights struggle.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, the Birmingham-based Southern Living claims about 2.5 million monthly
readers, many outside the South. The magazine is owned by Time Inc., which
purchased Southern Progress Corp., its holding company, in 1985.
</P>
<P>
	   Cunningham joined Southern Progress in 1948, rose through the ranks and as a
corporate executive convinced the company to launch Southern Living in 1966. He
became president and chief executive officer in 1968 and remained in those posts
until his retirement in 1987, though he remained an adviser.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Emory had an enormous impact on how the South is viewed,'' said William
Muse, president of Auburn University, where Cunningham was a trustee from 1987
to 1999. ``The idea for Southern Living was rooted in the idea of seeing the
culture of the South more fully appreciated and understood.''
</P>
<P>
	   Cunningham is survived by his wife, Jeanne Loftis Cunningham, and four
children.

<HEADLINE> Chevron's Earnings Soar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Chevron Corp.'s fourth-quarter earnings surged higher
on a jump in oil prices and beat analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
	   The second-largest U.S. oil firm said Tuesday it earned $809 million, or
$1.23 a share, for the October-December period compared with a loss of $206
million, or 31 cents a share, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Operating earnings, which exclude special items, were $819 million, or $1.24
per share, up from $503 million, or 76 cents per share, a year earlier. The
performance was a penny above the $1.23 estimate from analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue, boosted by a doubling of crude oil prices, totaled $10.98 billion
in the fourth quarter, up more than 50 percent from $7.28 billion a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   On the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Chevron fell 25 cents to $88.56.
</P>
<P>
	   "Earnings for the fourth quarter ... benefited from a rebound in crude oil
prices that began last spring," Chevron chairman and chief executive officer
Dave O'Reilly said. "Earnings were given a further boost by higher crude oil and
natural gas production and lower unit operating expenses."
</P>
<P>
	   O'Reilly took over managing the San Francisco-based company late last year.
</P>
<P>
	   While higher crude prices boosted income from exploration and production, it
resulted in lower margins for refining and marketing divisions as the costs
could not all be passed on to consumers. The company said output also was
affected by a March fire at its Richmond, Calif., refinery.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, net income was $2.07 billion, or $3.14 a share, compared
with $1.34 billion, or $2.04 a share in 1998. Excluding one-time items, earnings
were $2.29 billion, or $3.47 a share, in 1999, compared with $1.95 billion, or
$2.96 a share in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue was $35.45 billion, up 16 percent from $30.56 billion in 1998.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Cuba Trade Show Opens  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN RICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- The first American trade show in Cuba in four decades opened
Tuesday, evidence of quiet improvements in U.S.-Cuban relations occurring
beneath the political roar over 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's been 40 years between shows. It's sort of hard to say what to
expect,'' said Julio W. Seibel, who was trying to interest Cubans in a $62,000
lathe for producing plastic lenses for glasses.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Healthcare Exhibition is the latest small advance in U.S.-Cuban
relations since January 1999, when President Clinton changed rules to allow
increased contact between Americans and Cubans and to ease sales of medical
goods.
</P>
<P>
	   Ninety-seven U.S. companies took part in the exhibition, said Peter W.
Nathan, president of the organizer, PWN Exhibicion LLC of Westport, Conn.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is just the first step. There are many obstacles to overcome beyond
today,'' said Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., who inaugurated the event. She said
she had obtained Clinton's intervention to help overcome bureaucratic
roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
	   Even here, the debate over Elian Gonzalez intruded. ``I dedicate this to all
of the children of Cuba, especially Elian,'' Waters said.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the exhibitors said they were exploring a long-closed market rather
than looking for immediate sales. Cuba has limited cash and a heavy debt to many
foreign companies. Payments to U.S. companies are complicated by the U.S. trade
embargo.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is like a first step for all the companies here. We're trying to
learn about the market here. To tell the truth, I don't think we can
(immediately) sell anything,'' said Denisse Garcia, Latin American operations
manager for Datex-Ohmedia, which was showing computerized anesthesia machines
and infant incubators.
</P>
<P>
	   While rules limiting medical exports were eased last year, proposals to
fully lift restrictions on food and medical sales have foundered in Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban physicians are reputed to be very skillful, but they must struggle
with a lack of equipment and medicines because of Cuba's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials say that since 1992 they have granted 40 to 50 licenses to
American companies to sell medicines and medical supplies in Cuba, and that only
a handful of requests have been turned down.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. government says it licensed $19 million worth of American medical
sales to Cuba in 1998 and $26 million worth in the first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   But actual sales have been ``zero,'' said Hector Manuel Perez, president of
the Cuban Chamber of Commerce. ``The information I have is that there have been
none.'' U.S. officials say that at least some sales have gone through.
</P>
<P>
	   Perez said Cubans often turn to other suppliers while waiting for the U.S.
licenses to be granted. Financing or transportation arrangements sometimes fall
through.
</P>
<P>
	   Major U.S. corporations have increasingly shown irritation at the U.S.
embargo of Cuba and have pressed for the ability to compete for sales here.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My purpose is to see to it that the American businessman does not get
slotted out of this market, which I think has great potential,'' Nathan said.
``All the other industrialized countries are dealing with Cuba now and I think
the American businessman deserves that opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban doctors and ministry officials wandered through booths offering X-ray
imaging by Eastman Kodak, Vicks cough drops from Procter &AMP; Gamble,
vision-testing devices from Zeiss Humphrey Systems.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It gives us the chance to know about the advances that have been made in
the world,'' said Gisela Cartaya, an ophthalmology specialist at the Hermanos
Almeijeiras Hospital, after Oscar Layne of Humphrey Systems demonstrated a
$7,500 glaucoma detection machine which printed out a numerical and graphical
report on her eyes.
</P>
<P>
	   She said her hospital had equipment that performs similar functions. But
Layne, his company's Latin American sales director, said only a few companies in
the world produce equivalent devices. ``This is the standard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The last such U.S. trade show on the island is believed to have been a 1960
meeting for American travel agents.
</P>
<P>
	   Seibel, the Latin America manager for Gerber Coburn Co. of Miami, said he'd
been working in nearby Miami for 31 years. ``This is the first time I've been
able to offer something to Cuba.''

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under government orders, the Florida relatives of Elian
Gonzalez agreed Tuesday to make the boy available for a meeting with his Cuban

Congress not to force U.S. citizenship upon him.

	   Florman said the government had reassured the relatives that Wednesday's

<HEADLINE> Real Estate Developer Found Guilty  </HEADLINE>
   By SAMUEL MAULL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Real estate developer Abe Hirschfeld was found guilty
Tuesday of contempt of court for violating a judge's order to keep quiet about
his trial for allegedly trying to have his partner killed.
</P>
<P>
	   State Supreme Court Harold Beeler said Hirschfeld had disobeyed the gag
order by running advertisements in newspapers, apparently in an attempt to
influence jurors in Hirschfeld's trial on a criminal solicitation charge.
</P>
<P>
	   Beeler scheduled sentencing on the contempt charge for March 8. Hirschfeld
faces up to 30 days in jail and a $1,000 fine on each of the eight counts of
contempt.
</P>
<P>
	   Hirschfeld slumped in his seat after hearing Beeler's verdict, but said
nothing. Outside court, he had no comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge told lawyers to submit sentencing memos that include comment on
Hirschfeld's health. During the contempt hearing, Hirschfeld, 80, complained of
feeling ill and was taken to Beekman-Downtown Hospital for observation.
</P>
<P>
	   Hirschfeld was accused of trying to hire a hit man to kill business partner
Stanley Stahl in 1996. Stahl died in August of natural causes. Hirschfeld's
first case ended in a mistrial and his second trial is set to begin in February.
</P>
<P>
	   Acting as his own lawyer at the contempt hearing, Hirschfeld admitted that
he paid for newspaper ads reprinting a Daily News article from Oct. 7, 1999. The
article highlighted inconsistencies in the testimony of a key prosecution
witness.
</P>
<P>
	   Hirschfeld argued that he did not believe he violated the gag order because
he only paid to reprint an article that had already appeared in a widely
circulated newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Austria Leader Mulls New Coalition  </HEADLINE>
   By ROLAND PRINZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Austria's Socialist chancellor said Tuesday that he
was abandoning efforts to form a minority government after Joerg Haider's
far-right Freedom Party began talks with another conservative party on possibly
forming a new coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   Social Democratic Chancellor Viktor Klima told Austrian television that he
will meet Thursday with President Thomas Klestil to inform him that he saw no
chance of forming a new government to break the political stalemate that began
after inconclusive elections nearly four months ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Klima's decision increases the chances that the Freedom Party and its
controversial leader will share power in a new Austrian government.
</P>
<P>
	   Klestil's decision to ask Klima to try and form a minority government has
drawn sharp criticism. It came after talks between the Social Democrats and the
conservative Austrian People's Party -- who ran a coalition government for the
past 13 years -- failed last week.
</P>
<P>
	   With the prospects of a new coalition with the Social Democrats having
collapsed, the two conservative parties opened talks Tuesday, although they do
not have a formal mandate from the president.
</P>
<P>
	   At the end of their first round of talks, Haider spoke of a ``good start''
in which both sides ``demonstrated the desire to do something good for
Austria.''
</P>
<P>
	   Schuessel was more concrete, outlining key points he was looking for in the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   Any government arising from the talks must be one ``that says a clear `yes,'
to Europe,'' he said, alluding to Haider's past skepticism about the European
Union, of which Austria is a member.
</P>
<P>
	   Austria must specifically endorse EU expansion, said Schuessel -- something
Haider's party has opposed in the past, arguing that any early entry of former
Soviet bloc countries Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic would result in a
mass inflow of cheap labor to Austria.
</P>
<P>
	   The growing possibility that Haider's party would share power has alarmed
some foreigners and Austrians who oppose the Carinthia state governor's
opposition to immigration, position on the EU and controversial statements about
the Nazi regime.
</P>
<P>
	   A decade ago, Haider won international notoriety after he praised Adolf
Hitler's employment policies and described veterans of the Waffen SS as ``men of
character.'' Haider has been apologizing for those comments ever since.
</P>
<P>
	   Hours prior to the talks with the People's Party, Haider told reporters he
would not seek the post of chancellor.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, reaction in Israel to the news that Haider's party may form
part of a future Austrian government was swift.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel's Justice Minister Yossi Beilin said Tuesday that his government
should recall its ambassador from Vienna in such an event.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The moment he is there, in my opinion we will have to withdraw our
ambassador,'' Beilin told Israeli radio. ``We cannot accept such a phenomenon as
Haider, even if -- heaven forbid -- the entire world does.''
</P>
<P>
	   Beilin would have little to say in recalling an ambassador, but his views
likely represent those of the government.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel's Foreign Ministry, which would authorize such a move, did not
comment Tuesday, but Foreign Minister David Levy threatened to break off
diplomatic relations with Austria if Haider joined the government after election
results were announced in October, revealing that his party had moved into
second place.
</P>
<P>
	   Reiterating comments made by Haider on Austrian state TV late Monday,
Freedom Party official Thomas Prinzhorn said Tuesday that the two groups could
put together a coalition by the end of next week. Otherwise, he added, ``the
negotiations would have to be considered a failure.''

<HEADLINE> Cuban Grandmothers To Meet Elian  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under government orders, the Florida relatives of Elian
Gonzalez agreed Tuesday to make the boy available for a meeting with his Cuban
grandmothers Wednesday at a neutral site, the Justice Department said. The
grandmothers pressed their insistence for the boy's return and pleaded with
Congress not to force U.S. citizenship upon him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The meeting will take place at the time and site selected by the
Immigration Service,'' Justice spokeswoman Carole Florman said Tuesday evening.
The agreement culminated a long day of negotiations marked by an order from the
Immigration and Naturalization Service for the meeting, that had been thwarted
on Monday by the relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Florman said the government had reassured the relatives that Wednesday's
session at the Miami Beach home of the president of a Dominican college would be
just a visit and would not result in his being taken back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, after meeting lawmakers on Capitol Hill, Mariela Quintana, the
child's paternal grandmother, said, ''`He is only a 6-year-old boy. And he's a
Cuban.'' President Clinton said he would not rule out a veto if Congress passes
the citizenship bill.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS, part of the Justice Department, ordered the boy's great-uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez, to bring Elian to a meeting with the grandmothers at an
``appropriate neutral location'' at 4 p.m. EST Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS specified that location: the Miami Beach home of Barry University
President Jeanne O'Laughlin, a sister in the Roman Catholic Dominican order.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling followed Gonzalez's rejection Monday of a meeting anywhere other
than his own home.
</P>
<P>
	   The meeting ``is only a visit'' and does not change the boy's status, said
the letter signed by Michael A. Pearson, executive associate immigration
commissioner for field operations.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS has ruled that the boy should be returned to his father in Cuba.
Elian's Florida relatives have challenged that order in federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have everybody's word that the child will not be taken away,''
O'Laughlin said in an interview with The Associated Press. ``I wouldn't
participate if that was the case.''
</P>
<P>
	   If the relatives had refused to bring the boy to the meeting, Justice
attorneys could have gone into federal court in Miami for an order directing
compliance, said department officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy was found clinging to a life preserver in the Atlantic on Nov. 25
after his mother and 10 others died when their boat sank en route from Cuba to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Carol Fouke, a spokeswoman for the National Council of Churches, which
sponsored the grandmothers' trip, applauded the order for Wednesday's meeting
and said the grandmothers planned to leave Washington for Miami early Wednesday
morning, weather permitting. Washington was in the grips of a fierce snowstorm
that blanketed the area with more than a foot of snow.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers told reporters they had never seen snow before -- and were
surprised it was so cold.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the snowstorm, which closed many congressional offices, the two
women made the rounds of Capitol Hill on Tuesday, meeting with legislators
sympathetic to their wish to have Elian returned to his father's custody in Cuba
and their opposition to congressionally imposed citizenship on Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The only one who has a legal right with that child is his father,''
Quintana said.
</P>
<P>
	   Several Democratic senators suggested after meetings with the grandmothers
that they would wage a filibuster on the Senate floor, if necessary, to try to
block the citizenship bill.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It doesn't belong on the Senate floor,'' said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.
Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., agreed, saying, ``This boy ought to go home and
be with his father.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., and others who met with the women said the
grandmothers told them Elian's mother was on the ill-fated boat not to flee
Castro's oppression but because of pressure from her boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We asked some rather pointed questions,'' Hagel said. ``She was forced on
that boat.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, said after her meeting with the
grandmothers that she has asked Clinton to fight the citizenship legislation,
even if it means he has to veto it. ``Elian Gonzalez is not an orphan,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers brought with them a photo album and displayed a page with
an enlarged picture of Elian's Cuban family -- minus Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   Suggesting the picture showed how much Elian was missed, Raquel Rodriquez,
Elian's maternal grandmother, said that after losing her daughter in the boat
disaster, having U.S. citizenship forced upon Elian ``would be more painful''
and prolong the agony.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have no one else,'' she said, tears streaming down her face.
</P>
<P>
	   At the White House, Clinton urged Congress to delay action until the issue
had played out in court and to think first about ``what is right for the
child.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if he would veto such a bill, Clinton said, ``I have not decided what
to do and I would not rule that out.''
</P>
<P>
	   Versions of the citizenship bill were introduced Monday in both the House
and the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   The measure, drafted by members of the Florida congressional delegation,
would confer U.S. citizenship on Elian, thus removing the INS jurisdiction from
the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., a supporter of the bill, told
reporters Tuesday the Senate likely will debate the bill early next week, rather
than Wednesday as he earlier predicted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we're trying to do is find the best way to have an impartial,
nonpolitical decision made for the young boy,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sponsors blamed the delay on the snowstorm and the large number of senators
still out of town.

	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Sen. John McCain dropped efforts Tuesday to compete in
the Republican presidential primary in two New York congressional districts. But
he promised to keep fighting state Republicans' attempts to keep him off the
ballot in the rest.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was knocked off the ballot in three congressional districts this week
by local election officials after state Republicans challenged signatures on his
presidential petitions.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, R-Ariz., will not sue to overturn the dismissals for the South Bronx
and Suffolk County districts, his campaign lawyer, Henry Berger said. However,
other possible disqualifications will be challenged, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   State Republican leaders, who support Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the GOP
front-runner, challenged McCain's petitions in 16 of New York's 31 congressional
districts on grounds that he failed to obtain the required number of signatures.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Board of Election will hear eight additional challenges to
McCain's petitions on Wednesday.

	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- After arguing that state Republicans' plans for a
Feb. 19 presidential primary break federal voting rights laws, South Carolina
Democrats are dropping plans to hold a primary of their own.
</P>
<P>
	   That would take the state Democratic Party far from its early hopes of a
national-spotlight-grabbing primary to the relative obscurity of caucuses March
9, according to Scott Anderson, the party's executive director.
</P>
<P>
	   A final decision is expected by the end of the week, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   State Democratic leaders had hoped to hold a primary on the same day as the
GOP. But the Democratic National Committee would not bend its rules to allow an
early primary.
</P>
<P>
	   State Rep. Todd Rutherford and seven other voters complained Jan. 4 to the
U.S. Justice Department that the GOP primary would violate the Voting Rights Act
by keeping polling places in predominantly white precincts at the expense of
precincts in predominantly black areas.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department then asked state Democrats for information on their
primary plans as well.
</P>
<P>
	   State Democratic Party Chairman Dick Harpootlian said the Justice
Department's review of both South Carolina primaries was a factor in the
decision to move to caucuses.

	   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate John McCain's
campaign dismissed a full-page newspaper ad Tuesday accusing the former prisoner
of war of working against the interests of other Vietnam POWs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not going to dignify that ad with a response,'' said Mike Dennehy,
McCain's regional campaign director.
</P>
<P>
	   The ad, in The Union Leader of Manchester, accused the Arizona senator of
working to keep POW documents sealed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If released to the public, would these documents prove him to be an
authentic war hero or a traitorous collaborator?'' it asked.
</P>
<P>
	   The ad's accusations are not new.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, held captive in Vietnam for more than five years after his Navy jet
was shot down, has broad support among veterans, including other former POWs.
</P>
<P>
	   But a few ex-POWs have castigated McCain and others for supporting U.S.
diplomatic relations with Vietnam and for dismissing reports that some Americans
were left behind alive when other POWs were brought home in 1973.
</P>
<P>
	   The ad claims that McCain, as a member of a Senate investigation in the
early 1990s, belittled and threatened witnesses who claimed that live prisoners
were left behind.

</P>

<HEADLINE> FDIC Proposes Doubling Funding  </HEADLINE>
   By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., concerned about its
biggest losses from bank failures since the early 1990s, is proposing doubling
the minimum required funding for banks that specialize in risky loans to people
with inferior credit histories.
</P>
<P>
	   Regulators have warned that the higher-interest loans, called subprime
loans, can increase the risk of defaults for the deposit insurance fund. They
played a role in some of the eight U.S. bank failures last year. The eight
failures and another one in late 1998 cost the FDIC about $1 billion last year
-- its biggest annual hit since the regional banking crises of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   The failures, coming amid a booming economy, have worried regulators and
lawmakers. Compounding the concern, the FDIC is predicting that as many as 20
banks could go under this year.
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech last November, Donna Tanoue, the FDIC chairwoman, floated the
idea of increasing the required capital that banks and thrifts doing a lot of
subprime lending must have on hand.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe thrifts and banks with high concentrations of subprime loans
should be required to hold more capital than the current rules now dictate. A
lot more,'' Ms. Tanoue told bankers.
</P>
<P>
	   Now the FDIC has circulated a draft to the other federal banking agencies,
including the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,
which must all agree on a formal proposal to be put out for public comment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We know that they have a proposal out there for discussion purposes,''
David Runkel, a spokesman for the House Banking Committee, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of a federal government shutdown in Washington due to the East Coast
snowstorm, spokesmen for the FDIC and other banking agencies couldn't be reached
for comment on the proposal. It was first reported in Tuesday's editions of The
Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
	   There has been disagreement over the FDIC's proposed definition of subprime
borrowers, The Journal reported. Critics of the proposal have maintained that
under the definition -- borrowers who have made two payments 30 or more days
late or one payment 60 or more days late -- many community banks that lend to
low- and moderate-income people would be adversely affected.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal applies to all forms of consumer credit, including home
mortgages, credit cards, auto loans and personal loans.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDIC says it has found about 150 banks and thrifts with significantly
high levels of subprime loans. Together, those institutions hold about 5 percent
of total banking industry assets.
</P>
<P>
	   The Banking Committee chairman, Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, recently proposed
legislation that would give the head of the FDIC more authority over troubled
banks. His proposal was prompted by the failure last fall of First National Bank
of Keystone, a bank based in Keystone, W.Va., that grew by paying high interest
rates to attract capital from across the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The estimated $750 million loss to the FDIC insurance fund caused by
Keystone's failure could make it one of the 10 most expensive ever in this
country, with losses approaching 70 percent of the bank's assets. Federal
regulators, who closed the bank in September, said they found evidence of
apparent fraud that resulted in the depletion of its capital. They alleged, for
example, that $515 million in loans fraudulently remained on Keystone's books
after they had been sold.
</P>
<P>
	   Leach has said there are indications the regulators may not have properly
supervised Keystone when it engaged in risky financial strategies, and that the
FDIC was stymied at key points by other federal banking agencies in its desire
to examine the bank's activities.
</P>
<P>
	   Leach didn't immediately return a telephone call seeking comment Tuesday on
the FDIC's capital requirement proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   The bank insurance fund, which backs each account up to $100,000, has an
adequate cushion -- now some $29 billion -- to cover depositors' losses.
</P>
<P>
	   Through most of the 1990s, there were fewer than 10 bank failures a year.
But in 1992, at the height of the banking crisis, 122 banks failed, mostly in
Texas and New England as their oil and real estate booms, respectively,
collapsed.

<HEADLINE> Consumers Affected by Fuel Costs  </HEADLINE>
    By DENISE LAVOIE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Alex Terentino feels like fuel suppliers have him
over a barrel -- twice over.
</P>
<P>
	   Terentino has seen the amount he pays for home heating oil go from 99 cents
a gallon to $1.89 a gallon in a matter of weeks, while his bill for natural gas
at his Stamford butcher shop has doubled in the last month.
</P>
<P>
	   "You've got no choice. You've got to pay," said Terentino, one of many
consumers across the country complaining about the sudden and rapid rise in fuel
costs.
</P>
<P>
	   With much of the Northeast gripped by frigid temperatures during the past
week, usage of home heating oil was way up, leading to supply shortages in some
areas.
</P>
<P>
	   In East Hartford, fire officials urged residents to lower their thermostats
to conserve fuel after a main supplier, Motiva Enterprices LLC, said it expects
to run out of oil by mid-week. Several residents in two town trailer parks went
without heat for two days when their fuel wasn't resupplied in time.
</P>
<P>
	   With supply decreasing, home heating oil prices have responded by rising
dramatically. In Connecticut, retail prices shot up at least 40 cents a gallon,
to between $1.70 and close to $2 per gallon. In Massachusetts, the average
retail price rose to $1.74 a gallon Monday, up 57 cents from a week ago and more
than double what it was this time last year. And in New Hampshire, retail prices
jumped 49 cents in six days, from $1.22 per gallon to $1.71.
</P>
<P>
	   Truckers are also feeling the pinch because of sharp increases in the costs
of diesel fuel. In New York, the retail price of diesel fuel rose from a low of
$1.349 per gallon to a high of $2.059 per gallon from Thursday to Monday,
according to the New York State Motor Truck Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Even kerosene users were seeing steep price increases. At French's Kwick
Stop, near Hegesvillle, West Virginia, kerosene prices have jumped from 99 cents
a gallon a week ago to $1.69.
</P>
<P>
	   "People are shocked. I've been here 30 years and that's the highest I've
seen it," said Donna French.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton, after being inundated with pleas for help from officials
in several states, on Tuesday directed an emergency release of home heating
assistance funds. The money was to go to Alaska and the Northeastern states
"which have experienced the greatest hardship."
</P>
<P>
	   "These funds will help keep more American families safe and warm, and we'll
get them out there just as quickly as we possibly can," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Industry analysts say the sudden price increases have been caused by several
factors, including the recent cold snap, OPEC's decision to extend existing
production cuts past an original March deadline and low petroleum supplies.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you look at global inventories, they are certainly at some of the lowest
they've been at in many years," said George Beranek, an analyst with Petroleum
Finance Co., a private consulting firm based in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
	   "The low inventories are the result of the decisions made by OPEC, however,"
he said. "It has not reached the stage where suppliers are not getting what they
need."
</P>
<P>
	   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson on Tuesday ruled out using the U.S.
strategic oil reserve to help ease the price spiral. He said, however, that he
plans to meet with oil ministers from Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Venezuela and other
countries in coming weeks to discuss oil prices and yearlong production curbs by
OPEC producers.
</P>
<P>
	   During the past year, as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries has reduced production, prices of oil and gas have skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, winter was warmer than normal, and heating oil prices remained
stable and in some cases, dropped slightly during the season. Wholesale prices
for heating oil for delivery the following month traded on the New York
Mercantile Exchange were hovering around 32 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, heating oil for February delivery closed at 90.38 cents a
gallon, off a high last week of 93.50 cents.
</P>
<P>
	   While some people accepted the supply-and-demand theory, others suggested
there is some price-gouging going on. As a result, officials in several states
are investigating the higher prices.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have clear indications that there are surcharges on bills, nondelivery
of product, possible anti-competitive actions and lack of required notices of
shortages -- all of which may show violations of law," said Connecticut Attorney
General Richard Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas Prescott, of Johnny Prescott and Son Oil Co. in Concord, N.H., said
any so-called shortage is one created to make money.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no war in the Mideast, no refineries are down, there is no major
explosion in the market," he said. "It is a normal winter in terms of degree
days, and a cold snap of six to eight days should not force prices up one
nickel."

<HEADLINE> Seamus Heaney Wins Whitbread Prize  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Irish poet Seamus Heaney won the Whitbread Book of the Year
Award Tuesday for his translation of the 1,000-year-old Anglo-Saxon epic
``Beowulf.''
</P>
<P>
	   Children's writer J.K. Rowling, author of ``Harry Potter and the Prisoner of
Azkaban,'' came second.
</P>
<P>
	   It is the second time in four years that Nobel Prize-winning Heaney, 60,
picked up the Whitbread literary award, worth $35,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Judges struggled over whether a translation should be allowed to win but
they were unanimous that his book stood alone on merit, said Eric Anderson,
chairman of the judging panel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We felt this was a master poet breathing new life into a work that has
only been known to a tiny number of academics in the past,'' said Anderson.
</P>
<P>
	   The panel, which included model Jerry Hall and actress Imogen Stubbs, also
praised Heaney for retrieving a ``buried treasure.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Beowulf'' is the elegiac narrative of the adventures of a Scandinavian
hero who saves the Danes from the seemingly invincible monster Grendel and later
from Grendel's mother. He returns to his own country and dies in old age in a
vivid fight against a dragon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Russian poet Osip Mandelstan said that the poet's work is directed to
the reader in history, so for what I am translating I am grateful to receive
this award on my own,'' said Heaney in his acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
	   Heaney lives in Dublin and has taught at Harvard University since 1980.
</P>
<P>
	   His first major collection of poems, ``Death of a Naturalist,'' won several
prizes, and Heaney was awarded the Nobel Prize for his works in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Four years ago, he scooped the Whitbread Book of the Year Award for his book
``The Spirit Level.''
</P>
<P>
	   In total, 414 books were entered for the five award categories.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitbread's Children's Book of the Year was awarded to J.K. Rowling for the
third of her novels about apprentice wizard Harry Potter, ``Harry Potter and the
Prisoner of Azkaban.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rose Tremain's ``Music and Silence'' was named this year's best novel. Tim
Lott's ``White City Blue'' was named best first novel, and David Cairns's
``Berlioz, Volume Two'' was declared best biography.

<HEADLINE> LA Police Corruption Cases Dismissed  </HEADLINE>
   By LINDA DEUTSCH AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In the latest aftershock from a police scandal that has
shaken Los Angeles, a judge on Tuesday dismissed 10 drug and weapons convictions
because they were tainted by corruption.
</P>
<P>
	   That brought to 22 the number of cases thrown out because of police
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
	   The scandal is ``the most important case I have seen this office handle in
my 31 years here. It goes to the heart of the criminal justice system,'' said
Los Angeles County District Attorney Gil Garcetti, who sought the dismissals.
</P>
<P>
	   Garcetti said his office probably will seek reversal of another two to three
dozen cases contaminated by false testimony and the planting of evidence.
</P>
<P>
	   The scandal, the worst for LAPD in decades, has centered on an anti-gang
unit in the LAPD's Rampart Division. Twenty officers have either resigned or
been suspended.
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Thompson, 34, had his conviction overturned and was ordered immediately
freed from prison. He has served half of a six-year sentence for being a felon
in possession of a firearm.
</P>
<P>
	   Disgraced former LAPD officer Rafael Perez has admitted he testified falsely
during Thompson's trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Thompson plans to sue but remains fearful of police, said his attorney,
Carlos Spiga.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's afraid the police will try to dirty him up and compromise any civil
action,'' Spiga told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Also reversed was the drug conviction of Octavio Davalos. The 41-year-old
upholstery worker served 91 days and received three years of probation after
pleading guilty to possessing and selling cocaine and marijuana. Perez has said
he falsified the police report.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was never guilty of nothing,'' Davalos told reporters. He said he agreed
to a plea bargain because he was threatened with eight years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Davalos' lawyer told Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler his client would
like to recover expenses in connection with the case. Fidler said a civil lawyer
would surely be able to advise him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Since you are the first person present on this matter, the court's
apologies,'' the judge told Davalos.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the cases reversed Tuesday involved defendants who pleaded guilty or
no contest in return for probation or short prison sentences. Perez said he and
his former partner, Nino Durden, planted evidence in the cases or lied in police
reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Perez, a former Rampart anti-gang officer, pleaded guilty to stealing
evidence cocaine from a police locker. He has been cooperating with the
corruption probe in an attempt to lighten his sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   Durden has not been charged in the scandal, but Garcetti said he is under
investigation.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Grandmothers To Meet Elian  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under government orders, the Florida relatives of Elian
Gonzalez agreed Tuesday to make the boy available for a meeting with his Cuban
grandmothers Wednesday at a neutral site, the Justice Department said. The
grandmothers pressed their insistence for the boy's return and pleaded with
Congress not to force U.S. citizenship upon him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The meeting will take place at the time and site selected by the
Immigration Service,'' Justice spokeswoman Carole Florman said Tuesday evening.
The agreement culminated a long day of negotiations marked by an order from the
Immigration and Naturalization Service to hold the neutral-site meeting, that
had been thwarted on Monday by the relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Florman said the government had reassured the relatives that Wednesday's
session at the Miami Beach home of the president of a Dominican college would be
just a visit and would not result in his being taken back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers will see Elian privately, but the boy's Florida relatives
will be nearby in the house at the time, Florman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, after meeting lawmakers on Capitol Hill, Mariela Quintana, the
child's paternal grandmother, said, ``He is only a 6-year-old boy. And he's a
Cuban.'' President Clinton said he would not rule out a veto if Congress passes
the citizenship bill.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS, part of the Justice Department, ordered the boy's great-uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez, to bring Elian to a meeting with the grandmothers at an
``appropriate neutral location'' at 4 p.m. EST Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS specified that location: the Miami Beach home of Barry University
President Jeanne O'Laughlin, a sister in the Roman Catholic Dominican order.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling followed Gonzalez's rejection Monday of a meeting anywhere other
than his own home.
</P>
<P>
	   The meeting ``is only a visit'' and does not change the boy's status, said
the letter signed by Michael A. Pearson, executive associate immigration
commissioner for field operations.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS has ruled that the boy should be returned to his father in Cuba.
Elian's Florida relatives have challenged that order in federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have everybody's word that the child will not be taken away,''
O'Laughlin said in an interview with The Associated Press. ``I wouldn't
participate if that was the case.''
</P>
<P>
	   If the relatives had refused to bring the boy to the meeting, Justice
attorneys could have gone into federal court in Miami for an order directing
compliance, said department officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy was found clinging to a life preserver in the Atlantic on Nov. 25
after his mother and 10 others died when their boat sank en route from Cuba to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Carol Fouke, a spokeswoman for the National Council of Churches, which
sponsored the grandmothers' trip, applauded the order for Wednesday's meeting
and said the grandmothers planned to leave Washington for Miami early Wednesday
morning, weather permitting. Washington was in the grips of a fierce snowstorm
that blanketed the area with more than a foot of snow.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers told reporters they had never seen snow before -- and were
surprised it was so cold.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the snowstorm, which closed many congressional offices, the two
women made the rounds of Capitol Hill on Tuesday, meeting with legislators
sympathetic to their wish to have Elian returned to his father's custody in Cuba
and their opposition to congressionally imposed citizenship on Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The only one who has a legal right with that child is his father,''
Quintana said.
</P>
<P>
	   Several Democratic senators suggested after meetings with the grandmothers
that they would wage a filibuster on the Senate floor, if necessary, to try to
block the citizenship bill.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It doesn't belong on the Senate floor,'' said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.
Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., agreed, saying, ``This boy ought to go home and
be with his father.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., and others who met with the women said the
grandmothers told them Elian's mother was on the ill-fated boat not to flee
Castro's oppression but because of pressure from her boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We asked some rather pointed questions,'' Hagel said. ``She was forced on
that boat.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, said after her meeting with the
grandmothers that she has asked Clinton to fight the citizenship legislation,
even if it means he has to veto it. ``Elian Gonzalez is not an orphan,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers brought with them a photo album and displayed a page with
an enlarged picture of Elian's Cuban family -- minus Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   Suggesting the picture showed how much Elian was missed, Raquel Rodriquez,
Elian's maternal grandmother, said that after losing her daughter in the boat
disaster, having U.S. citizenship forced upon Elian ``would be more painful''
and prolong the agony.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have no one else,'' she said, tears streaming down her face.
</P>
<P>
	   At the White House, Clinton urged Congress to delay action until the issue
had played out in court and to think first about ``what is right for the
child.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if he would veto such a bill, Clinton said, ``I have not decided what
to do and I would not rule that out.''
</P>
<P>
	   Versions of the citizenship bill were introduced Monday in both the House
and the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   The measure, drafted by members of the Florida congressional delegation,
would confer U.S. citizenship on Elian, thus removing the INS jurisdiction from
the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., a supporter of the bill, told
reporters Tuesday the Senate likely will debate the bill early next week, rather
than Wednesday as he earlier predicted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we're trying to do is find the best way to have an impartial,
nonpolitical decision made for the young boy,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sponsors blamed the delay on the snowstorm and the large number of senators
still out of town.

<HEADLINE> National Labs Improve Security  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The lax security that allowed a Los Alamos scientist to
transfer and copy hundreds of nuclear weapons codes six years ago has been
corrected, but computer security at the labs still is not 100 percent, the
Energy Department's top security official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Eugene Habiger, the department's head of security, said he is ''99.5 percent
confident'' that America's nuclear secrets are protected from cyber-espionage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But when it comes to computer stuff to say impossible is pretty tough,''
said Habiger at a news conference in which the department's top security and
counterintelligence officials ticked off dozens of actions taken over the past
year to improve protection of nuclear secrets at the weapons labs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've dramatically improved security,'' said Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson in a separate interview Tuesday. He said that the security and
counterespionage activities at the labs have improved so much that security
should not be an issue in Congress this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The firing of computer scientist Wen Ho Lee from the Los Alamos National
Laboratory for security violations last March and a congressional report on
alleged Chinese espionage unleashed months of criticism of the Energy
Department's security and counterintelligence operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee last month was arrested and charged with illegally transferring files of
nuclear weapons codes from a highly secure computer system to a system
accessible to outside hackers, and copying the files onto computer tapes. The
violations occurred in 1993 and 1994 and seven of the tapes have not been
recovered, the government contends.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson said that couldn't happen with the security improvements now in
place. And Habiger, whom Richardson calls his ``security czar'' said new
procedures including an ``air gap'' -- or physical separation of the secure and
unsecure computer systems -- and ``elaborate controls'' on any physical
transfers would prevent a repeat of what Lee has acknowledged he did.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee admits he transferred the files, but insists he never provided the data
to anyone, including the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson said that a series of security tests over the past summer and
fall at the three labs --Sandia and Los Alamos in New Mexico and Lawrence
Livermore in California -- showed ``dramatic'' improvements.
</P>
<P>
	   A year-end status report gave each of the labs ``satisfactory'' grades --
the highest possible -- in overall security in December. Lawrence Livermore
continued to be ``marginal'' in unclassified cyber-security in December, but
officials said they expected improvement in coming months.
</P>
<P>
	   Glenn Podonsky, whose office conducted the tests, said he could not
elaborate on Lawrence Livermore's shortcomings because such details are
classified.
</P>
<P>
	   The DOE security ``Progress Report'' put together by Habiger's office cited
``monumental strides in improving security'' from improvements in security badge
identification to hiring additional cyber-security experts and greater awareness
about security by lab scientists.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, the review by Habiger's office said it is still possible --
though increasingly difficult -- to remove data from a classified computer
system.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the tasks left, said the report is ``complete ongoing programs to
ensure physical incompatibility between classified and unclassified computer
systems as well as totally restricting any capability of removing data from a
classified system.''

<HEADLINE> Man Convicted in Murder on Tape  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- A man who fatally shot his ex-wife at a
cemetery while a TV camera rolled was found guilty of murder.
</P>
<P>
	   A jury took just over an hour Tuesday to convict Emilio Nunez, 40, in the
slaying of Maritza Martin.
</P>
<P>
	   Broward Circuit Judge Daniel Andrews sentenced Nunez to life in prison with
a minimum of 25 years before he can be considered for parole. Nunez was given
credit for the seven years he has already served while awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
	   A reporter for the Spanish-language network Telemundo was interviewing Nunez
in 1993 at the grave of his 15-year-old daughter, who had killed herself.
Nunez's ex-wife arrived unexpectedly, and he accused her of causing their
daughter's suicide by slapping the girl because she was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
	   Nunez then pulled a gun, shot Ms. Martin in the head and fired 11 more times
as she lay on the ground.
</P>
<P>
	   The reporter, Ingrid Cruz, and her cameraman ran for cover, but not before
filming much of the shooting. The tape was shown in court.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorney Reemberto Diaz told the jury that Nunez was angered by the
reporter's questions. The attorney said Cruz had asked questions designed to get
an emotional response.
</P>
<P>
	   Telemundo spokesman Ted Guefen countered last week: ``It is irresponsible to
suggest that Telemundo or Ingrid Cruz are in any way responsible for this
terrible tragedy.''

<HEADLINE> Dallas Councilman Convicted  </HEADLINE>
   By PAM EASTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AMARILLO, Texas (AP) -- A federal jury convicted a Dallas city council
member on Tuesday of 65 counts of bribery and conspiracy after deciding that
$36,000 in cash payments influenced his votes.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury deliberated about four hours before convicting Al Lipscomb, a
74-year-old black civil rights activist. He faces up to life in prison and a
fine up to $16.2 million when the sentencing phase begins next week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The evidence against him was compelling,'' said prosecutor Michael Uhl.
``Nobody's above the law -- no matter how old you are, what you've done in life
or what color you are.''
</P>
<P>
	   Defense lawyers said race was an issue in the jury's verdict. All 12 jurors
were white.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unfortunately, I was right when I told Al he should plead in Dallas,
because he couldn't get a jury of his peers in Amarillo,'' attorney Billy
Ravkind said.
</P>
<P>
	   In closing arguments earlier Tuesday, defense attorneys contended the
government had not proven its public corruption case.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Where's the evidence of the bribe?'' asked attorney Tom Melsheimer. ``Do
you think Al Lipscomb waited until he was 70 and then became a crooked
politician?''
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorneys said Lipscomb received money from a number of people
supporting his civil rights causes but that his voting on the council hasn't
been swayed.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecution contended Lipscomb was influenced by $36,000 he received
from a Dallas cab company owner when taxi-related issues came before the
council.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Lipscomb acknowledged that blanks on his campaign finance reports
had cast a cloud of suspicion over him and said he put ``not applicable'' on the
forms to protect contributors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Coming from my era ... I have always made it an effort to protect the
people who have helped me in the struggle,'' he testified.
</P>
<P>
	   Lipscomb contended his voting record was beyond reproach.
</P>
<P>
	   He was elected to the council in 1984 and has served all but two years
since. His 1971 long-shot mayoral race was the first time a black had run for
the office in Dallas.
</P>

<HEADLINE> California Ranks Public Schools  </HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER KERR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- California ranked its nearly 7,000 public schools
for the first time Tuesday as part of an ambitious attempt to boost dismal test
scores, and those with high numbers of minority and poor children drew the
lowest marks.
</P>
<P>
	   The state also broke down student performance on achievement tests by
certain demographic factors. Black, Hispanic and poor students scored well below
the median ranking, while white and Asian students were above it, according to a
computer-assisted analysis by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   The Academic Performance Index is a key piece of Democratic Gov. Gray Davis'
plan to turn around the state's struggling public school system and part of a
national trend toward setting educational standards.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Starting today, the era of accountability has finally begun in public
education,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
	   Each school's rating, based on 1999 student achievement test scores, will
serve as its base score for determining whether it will take part in a
three-year, $96 million improvement program or share in $146 million in rewards
after the 2000 test.
</P>
<P>
	   Schools that fail to improve within three years could face sanctions as
severe as closing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It gives every school a chance to demonstrate improvement,'' Davis said.
``Schools are measured solely against themselves. All they have to do is show
they got better next year compared to last year.''
</P>
<P>
	   California is among 26 states that publicly rank public schools, according
to the Education Commission for the States, a Denver-based organization that
helps states improve education.
</P>
<P>
	   The state is in ``kind of the second wave'' of the better-schools movement,
behind pioneers such as Kentucky, Texas and North Carolina, but is still ahead
of half of the states with no such systems, said Kathy Christie, a policy
analyst for the commission.
</P>
<P>
	   California's ratings were prompted by years of below-average scores on
standardized tests. In the most recent National Assessment of Education Progress
scores, only 20 percent of California fourth-graders scored at or above the
proficient level.
</P>
<P>
	   In the ratings released Tuesday, each school received a score from 200 to
1,000 based on their students' scores on last year's statewide achievement test.
</P>
<P>
	   The statewide median score was 627. Davis' goal is getting all schools to
800; 5,951 fell below that, while 779 schools met or exceeded it.
</P>
<P>
	   The lowest-scoring schools had high percentages of students on free lunches,
of minority children, of English learners and of teachers working on emergency
credentials. Six of the 10 lowest scores came from elementary schools in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   The lowest score in the state is 302 for Saul Martinez Elementary School in
Mecca, a small farming community in Southern California near the Salton Sea.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the school's 693 students come from migrant farmworker families and
don't speak English, said Martha Tureen, assistant superintendent of educational
services for the Coachella Valley Unified School District. More than 90 percent
qualify for free lunches.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The poverty has a huge effect,'' Ms. Tureen said. ``We take for granted
that children come from homes with books and TVs and computers. A lot of these
kids are living in cars.''
</P>
<P>
	   The highest-scoring schools were in affluent suburbs or catered to gifted
students.
</P>
<P>
	   The top score of 966 went to Gretchen Whitney High School in Cerritos, about
20 miles southeast of Los Angeles. All of its graduates go to college, 65
percent of them to the University of California.

<HEADLINE> GOP Nomination Fight Shifts to N.H.  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NASHUA, N.H. (AP) -- George W. Bush said Tuesday he looked forward to a
``spirited contest'' for New Hampshire votes as his chief GOP rival John McCain
declared himself more prepared to lead and Steve Forbes said he was the
``authentic conservative'' in the race.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, who limped out of Iowa's Monday night caucuses with a
slim 1 percent of the vote, planned to drop out of the nominating contest on
Wednesday, an aide said, leaving a five-man Republican field with Gary Bauer and
Alan Keyes still in the race.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, who won Iowa's contest -- the first voting of the campaign season --
with 41 percent of the vote called the outcome a ``good beginning'' for his
front-running campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The people of Iowa heard my message and I believe the people of New
Hampshire will as well,'' the Texas governor said at a Bedford stop. ``It is
going to be a spirited contest here.''
</P>
<P>
	   Calling himself the ``authentic conservative'' in the race, Forbes sought to
capitalize on his unexpectedly strong showing in Iowa with 30 percent of the
vote for a second-place finish.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Republican establishment has met its match,'' Forbes said at a news
conference in Nashua.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes said he was not worried about his distant third-place standing in the
New Hampshire polls because surveys in Iowa also showed him doing poorly there.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think we are going to have a dramatic three-way race in New Hampshire,''
Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush rejected the notion that Forbes is a threat and said he would focus on
beating McCain, who is leading Bush in New Hampshire polls after skipping Iowa
to concentrate on the Granite State.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Obviously, the race in New Hampshire is with John McCain,'' Bush told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. McCain of Arizona called himself the most qualified GOP candidate for
the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am fully prepared to be president of the United States -- more prepared
than any other candidate,'' he told reporters, without naming any names.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who has emphasized campaign finance reform, said Monday's Supreme
Court decision ``vindicated'' his crusade to rid the nation of big money
politics. By 6-3 vote, the justices reaffirmed states' power to impose limits on
political campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Not only vindicated, but this is what the whole campaign was about, is
about,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   Abortion, a hot-button topic in Republican politics, helped Forbes win
conservative votes in Iowa with his flat anti-abortion stance. Bush also faced
questions three days in a row last week on the topic, and at one point said he
supports the Republican anti-abortion platform -- although it doesn't allow for
exceptions he backs in cases of rape, incest or to save the mother's life.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, asked Tuesday whether he would favor changing the abortion ban in
the GOP platform to allow such abortion exceptions, said, ``I would support the
change.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``That is the position of (Rep.) Henry Hyde, who is a leader of the pro-life
movement,'' McCain told reporters in Sunapee, N.H., although he declined to say
whether he would actively seek such a change.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if he was worried about competition from Forbes, McCain said: ``The
more the merrier.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., dismissed Forbes'
Iowa showing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This was his high water mark. He'll go down, hopefully fast,'' Lott
predicted. ``What is he, publisher of a magazine? Great ... Alan Keyes is more
qualified to be president than he is.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and McCain have argued about their rival tax plans, with the Texas
governor looking for a new line of attack nearly every day. On Tuesday, Bush
pointed to new government projections of a possible $1.9 trillion surplus over a
decade, and said he would use half that for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The difference between that and Senator McCain's plan is that 25 cents of
the proverbial dollar goes to tax cuts under my plan, and five cents under his
-- and therein lies one the debates of this campaign,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said Bush ``can't win'' with the tax debate because too many details
confuse people.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you can't win on the big issues, then go into the details,'' McCain
said dismissively.
</P>
<P>
	   A blizzard that dumped nearly a foot of snow clogged the campaign trail as
GOP contenders struggled to pack campaign events into the one day between Iowa
and their debate Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Barbara Fields, of Washington, N.H., advised the candidates to keep slogging
through the snow.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People here like to talk to them one on one, themselves, so in that way I
think it's different than Iowa,'' Fields, 68, said after loading friends into
her husband's truck for the 10-mile trip to see McCain at the American Legion
hall in Hillsboro. ``If we're here, they'd better be here.''

<HEADLINE> Profits Drop at Washington Post Co.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Washington Post Co. said Tuesday that net profits
fell 4 percent in the fourth quarter due to losses from its investment in
BrassRing Inc., an online job search and recruiting service.
</P>
<P>
	   The Washington Post, whose holdings include its flagship newspaper and
Newsweek magazine, earned $61.0 million, or $6.09 per share, in the fourth
quarter, compared with $63.8 million, or $6.30 per share, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had anticipated earnings
of $7.23 per share. Shares of The Washington Post fell $4.75 to $562 on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   The Washington Post said revenue edged 1 percent higher in the fourth
quarter, to $598.4 million, compared with $591.4 million in the fourth quarter
of 1998. Operating income rose 8 percent to $118.1 million from $109.5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   For fiscal year 1999, the Washington Post said earnings per share declined
46 percent from 1998, when profits were swelled by several one-time gains. Those
gains included proceeds from the sale of the company's 28 percent interest in
Cowles Media Company, the sale of 14 small cable systems and the sale of the
company's interest in Junglee, an Internet commerce company.
</P>
<P>
	   Without the one-time gains in 1998, profits would have risen 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Washington Post had net income of $225.8 million for its fiscal year
ended January 2, 2000, compared with net income of $417.3 million for the fiscal
year ended January 3, 1999. Earnings per share totaled $22.30 in 1999, compared
to $41.10 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Operating income rose 3 percent in 1999 to $388.5 million from $378.9
million in 1998, helped along by an increase in advertising revenues at The
Washington Post and Newsweek. Also, the company cited growth in subscriber
revenues at the cable division and a 19 percent decline in newsprint costs.

<HEADLINE> Large Fine Ordered for Brazil Spill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- President Fernando Henrique Cardoso ordered
the federal oil company, Petrobras, to pay the maximum fine possible for a
massive oil spill in Rio's Guanabara Bay, the environment ministry said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Minister Jose Sarney Filho said Petrobras will likely be charged with four
counts of breaking Brazil's tough environmental law. The maximum fine is $28
million.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The fine will likely be much higher because they could be fined separately
on each of the four counts,'' said Sarney Filho aide, Eliana Lucena by telephone
from Brasilia. ``The fine will be fully applied in cleaning up the bay.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, a pipeline at the company's Reduc oil refinery broke and spewed
338,000 gallons of crude into the bay. The oil polluted protected mangrove
swamps, fouled beaches and killed seabirds, fish and crustaceans.
</P>
<P>
	   Rio de Janeiro state prosecutors reportedly will seek a temporary closing of
the refinery, which is operating without a license from the state environmental
office.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Peace Talks in Stalemate  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE COPANS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- With only three weeks to go before a crucial deadline in
the peace talks, Israel and the Palestinians accused one another Tuesday of not
taking the process seriously.
</P>
<P>
	   The sides had set Feb. 13 as a deadline for creating the outline of an
agreement on the thorniest issues between them, including borders, Palestinian
refugees, Jewish settlers and the fate of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
	   But Palestinian negotiator Ahmed Qureia said that after 21 meetings on the
final status talks, nothing had been achieved and it was unlikely the sides
would meet the deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe it is because the Israelis are still hesitant to proceed
seriously and to empower the delegation,'' Qureia said. Lead Israeli negotiator
Oded Eran has also said meeting the Feb. 13 deadline is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
	   Hoping to spur the peace talks, the Palestinians had proposed a summit in
Davos, Switzerland this weekend. The summit was to include Prime Minister Ehud
Barak, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and President Clinton, but the event
appeared unlikely to take place late Tuesday because Barak has all but rejected
the idea and Clinton never expressed any interest in it.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinians blamed Israel for what they called the summit's collapse,
saying Barak was ``hesitant.'' That provoked a strong reaction from Barak's
office, which said that the summit was never seriously considered.
</P>
<P>
	   The prime minister has not yet ruled out traveling to Davos but preferred
that disputes between the sides be settled on home turf, said his spokesman Gadi
Baltiansky.
</P>
<P>
	   Blaming Barak for the collapse of the summit ``does not demonstrate the
seriousness needed to ensure the success of the negotiations,'' Baltiansky said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinians want intensive U.S. involvement in the process, believing that
Clinton's eagerness for a rapid resolution will lead him to pressure Barak into
coming around to some Palestinian demands.
</P>
<P>
	   In another sign the talks were in trouble, Arafat said he would declare a
Palestinian state this year even if differences with Israel have not been worked
out.
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat has throughout the peace process used a the threat of a unilateral
declaration of statehood to press Israel into accelerating talks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This year is the year of the Palestinian state,'' Arafat said in the Gaza
Strip as he returned from talks in Cairo with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
	   Senior Palestinian Liberation Organization officials warned earlier this
month that a statehood declaration could conceivably come as early as Feb. 2,
when the PLO's policy-making Central Council meets.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Arafat said Palestinian statehood would be ``one of the main
issues'' at that meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak has not objected to Palestinian statehood, but Israeli opponents to
the peace process would likely use a unilateral statehood declaration as proof
that the prime minister had lost control of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Tuesday, 5,000 protesters rallied against the Palestinians getting any
part of Jerusalem as part of any permanent peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak has pledged to keep the city undivided, but ministers close to the
prime minister have suggested that three Arab suburbs of Jerusalem could
eventually become the Palestinian capital.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We came to demonstrate to our fellow Jews that the government is selling
Jerusalem,'' said Moshe Cohen, 47, a protester who lives in a West Bank
settlement. ``This signifies the extinction of Zionism.''

<HEADLINE> Candidates Now Headed to N.H.  </HEADLINE>
   By CAROL ANN RIHA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Charter flights were carrying the presidential
candidates eastward to New Hampshire even as the final numbers from the Iowa
caucuses were still flipping on the tote boards.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore, former Sen. Bill Bradley, Texas Gov. George W. Bush
and publisher Steve Forbes all scurried to the airport to board planes set to
converge on the Manchester, N.H., airport about 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was just a mad rush of everybody at once,'' said Pam Dunston, who
was on the flight desk Monday night at Signature Flight Support at the Des
Moines airport.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was very busy because we had all their motorcades that had to get out
to the planes, all their different press people, cameramen from NBC and
everywhere trying to get out there'' to the tarmac, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dunston said Gore, Bush and Forbes flew big planes loaded with press. There
also were separate planes loaded with media.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think this year was probably bigger than the past ...'' said Bill
Flannery, aviation director for the Des Moines International Airport. ``But
January tends to be a slow month, and certainly ... airlines and car rental
people do a nice business in January because of the caucuses.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes' entourage -- on a commercial flight -- was turned back by a
snowstorm on the East Coast. After changing planes in Detroit, they were an hour
out of Boston's Logan Airport when it was closed because of whiteout conditions.
The plane returned to Detroit.
</P>
<P>
	   The former diplomat had planned to attend a fund-raiser in Keene, N.H., on
Tuesday night, but met instead with Detroit-area media and appeared on several
television news programs via satellite, said Keyes spokesman Peter Malvey.
</P>
<P>
	   Malvey said Keyes would be on a flight early Wednesday to participate in a
debate in Manchester, NH. ``We'll do whatever it takes to get the ambassador to
the debate.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Orrin Hatch, who finished with a 1 percent showing in Iowa, crept
quietly out of town. He was expected to announced Wednesday he was dropping out
of the race.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Iowa Historical Building on Tuesday, NBC crews were still dismantling
the two full-size studios they built on the museum's third-floor terrace to
showcase the view of Iowa's golden domed Capitol. CBS crews, which had set up on
the second floor of the Capitol law library, were still packing up Tuesday
morning.

<HEADLINE> LA Police Corruption Cases Dismissed  </HEADLINE>
   By LINDA DEUTSCH AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In the latest aftershock from a police scandal that has
shaken Los Angeles, a judge on Tuesday dismissed 10 drug and weapons convictions
because they were tainted by corruption.
</P>
<P>
	   That brought to 22 the number of cases thrown out because of police
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
	   The scandal is ``the most important case I have seen this office handle in
my 31 years here. It goes to the heart of the criminal justice system,'' said
Los Angeles County District Attorney Gil Garcetti, who sought the dismissals.
</P>
<P>
	   Garcetti said his office probably will seek reversal of another two to three
dozen cases contaminated by false testimony and the planting of evidence.
</P>
<P>
	   The scandal, the worst for LAPD in decades, has centered on an anti-gang
unit in the LAPD's Rampart Division. Twenty officers have either resigned or
been suspended.
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Thompson, 34, had his conviction overturned and was ordered immediately
freed from prison. He has served half of a six-year sentence for being a felon
in possession of a firearm.
</P>
<P>
	   Disgraced former LAPD officer Rafael Perez has admitted he testified falsely
during Thompson's trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Thompson plans to sue but remains fearful of police, said his attorney,
Carlos Spiga.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's afraid the police will try to dirty him up and compromise any civil
action,'' Spiga told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Also reversed was the drug conviction of Octavio Davalos. The 41-year-old
upholstery worker served 91 days and received three years of probation after
pleading guilty to possessing and selling cocaine and marijuana. Perez has said
he falsified the police report.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was never guilty of nothing,'' Davalos told reporters. He said he agreed
to a plea bargain because he was threatened with eight years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Davalos' lawyer told Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler his client would
like to recover expenses in connection with the case. Fidler said a civil lawyer
would surely be able to advise him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Since you are the first person present on this matter, the court's
apologies,'' the judge told Davalos.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the cases reversed Tuesday involved defendants who pleaded guilty or
no contest in return for probation or short prison sentences. Perez said he and
his former partner, Nino Durden, planted evidence in the cases or lied in police
reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Perez, a former Rampart anti-gang officer, pleaded guilty to stealing
evidence cocaine from a police locker. He has been cooperating with the
corruption probe in an attempt to lighten his sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   Durden has not been charged in the scandal, but Garcetti said he is under
investigation.

<HEADLINE> Hearst Corp. Sweetens Examiner Deal  </HEADLINE>
    By KIM CURTIS AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The Hearst Corp. is making a new effort to find a
buyer for the San Francisco Examiner, adding trucks, printing presses and other
assets to the deal along with the newspaper's name and subscriber list.
</P>
<P>
	   Examiner publisher Timothy O. White said Tuesday the offer was sweetened to
hasten the sale of the paper and alleviate antitrust concerns from local, state
and federal officials about Hearst's proposed purchase of the paper's longtime
rival, the morning San Francisco Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel that the logjam we have lived with for five months is being broken,"
White told the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
	   In August, Hearst said it planned to buy the Chronicle for $660 million and
sell the afternoon Examiner, but only its name and goodwill, not the physical
assets needed to put out a paper. If no qualified buyer were found, Hearst said
it would merge the two newspapers.
</P>
<P>
	   The original offer attracted no buyers, White said Tuesday. "Whether this
was seen as a phony offer or sham ... this should set those criticisms aside,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department is continuing its investigation, spokeswoman Gina
Talamona said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Stephen Barnett, a professor at the University of California's Boalt Law
School and expert on newspaper competition issues, said the change in terms
"creates a more realistic chance of selling the Examiner."
</P>
<P>
	   For the public, he said, "It means there is a chance of not only continuing
to have two daily papers, but having two daily papers that really compete with
each other."
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1965, the papers have been subject to a joint operating agreement,
employing separate news staffs and competing for stories, but sharing printing
and business operations and profits. The San Francisco JOA expires in 2005, but
last year the owners of Chronicle Publishing decided to sell the company's
assets.
</P>
<P>
	   Whether the JOA might be transferred to a new Examiner owner was not
specifically addressed in Hearst's statement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Knight Ridder CEO Tony Ridder said in November he might be interested in
buying the paper "if we could step into Hearst's shoes and have the Examiner and
their position in the JOA." He was traveling Tuesday and unavailable for
comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The Chronicle is the nation's 13th-largest daily newspaper, with a
circulation of 456,000. The Examiner, the flagship of the media empire William
Randolph Hearst began 112 years ago, has a circulation of 107,129 daily, and
578,541 when its news sections are combined with Chronicle features on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Seeks New Hampshire Support  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HUDSON, N.H. (AP) -- Democrat Bill Bradley appealed to the independent
streak of New Hampshire voters to revive his presidential hopes Tuesday, saying
Al Gore's Iowa victory would carry little weight here. Gore leapt to agree:
``New Hampshire doesn't take its cue or lead from anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley also was looking for a quick way to sharpen his differences with the
vice president and give voters better reasons to support him before next
Tuesday's primary.
</P>
<P>
	   The two men square off in a debate Wednesday night at 9 p.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
	   The day after his one-sided loss to Gore in Iowa, Bradley got a rousing
airport welcome from supporters at 3:30 a.m. and spoke later in the day at a
high school. He also spent considerable time resting up from the Iowa
campaigning and preparing for the debate.
</P>
<P>
	   An upbeat Gore, with campaign events through the day, jokingly dismissed the
snowstorm that arrived in New Hampshire along with the candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They know how to deal with snow here,'' Gore said after picking up a stash
of donuts and hot coffee for a snowplow crew. ``In Washington, you get one flake
and forget it.''
</P>
<P>
	   He emphasized his energy through the day, telling reporters he had had only
an hour of sleep and was ``running on adrenaline.''
</P>
<P>
	   He took what was supposed to be an abbreviated schedule and rewrote it as he
went along, crisscrossing from a school to the donut shop to the snowplow
garage, back to the school and then to a surprise drop-in at MTV's ``Choose or
Lose'' youth voter drive and rock concert at New Hampshire College.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said at his high school stop that his nontraditional campaign style
works well in this state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``New Hampshire is a bastion of independent thinking,'' he said. ``Nobody
tells them what to do. They make up their own minds.''
</P>
<P>
	   Aides had billed his speech as kicking off a new phase of the campaign,
redefining and sharpening the differences with Gore. But in the speech, the
former New Jersey senator did not mention the vice president or the results in
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, he talked in larger themes about changing the political culture,
pointing to what he argued was a 20-year record of leadership on economic issues
and his opposition to attack politics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you are tired of misrepresentation in political campaigns to pursue a
personal agenda, if you are tired of what you have seen in the last decade in
this country, then you can send a message,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore was careful to keep his remarks free of any overconfidence, mindful of
the state's reputation for rejecting front-runners.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a tough fight and we are not going to take anything for granted,''
Gore said at a rally so smoothly staged that it resembled a White House event.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I understand very clearly that New Hampshire doesn't take its cue or lead
from anywhere else,'' he said. ``You make your own decisions and I'm asking you
for your vote.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore defeated Bradley 65 percent to 35 percent in Iowa, but polls show a
much closer race in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   While aides argued that Bradley would be more aggressive as he resumed his
New Hampshire campaign, outside analysts said he faced a delicate task in
confronting Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's outrageously high risk'' said unaligned Democratic consultant Dana
Strother. Strother argued that a core Bradley appeal is depicting himself as a
nontraditional politician and venturing into personal attacks could risk that
image. Others said Bradley has suffered early in the campaign because he has
been slow to respond to attacks from Gore, and warned that time may be running
out.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It may be too late,'' said University of Virginia political science
professor Larry Sabato. ``He's sitting in the middle of the ring and letting
Gore pound him.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley himself said Tuesday that voters respond to his disdain for
``excessive partisanship'' and ``politics as usual.'' Focusing on issues where
he says he differs from Gore, he argued that both the health care and tax
proposals he's offered would work better than Gore's for middle class voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore was dogged at each stop Tuesday by two men trying to make a negative
point about his 1996 fund-raising tactics at a Buddhist monastery.
</P>
<P>
	   Justin Bonner, 20, and Brian McHugh, 19, said they had driven up from Boston
to follow Gore around in maroon and saffron robes and flesh colored skull caps.
They carried a briefcase labeled, ``Al Gore Finance Committee.''

<HEADLINE> Britain Lets Gay Couple's Twins Stay  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Surrogate twins brought into Britain by a gay couple have been
given permission to stay indefinitely, the Home Office said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The twins were born Dec. 9 to a surrogate mother in Modesto, Calif. with the
help of an American egg donor and an American surrogate mother. Sperm was taken
from one of the British partners.
</P>
<P>
	   The fathers, Barrie Drewitt, 35, and Tony Barlow, 32, won a landmark case in
California to have their names recorded on the birth certificates as parents of
the twins. Under British law however, the legal parents of twins Saffron and
Aspen are still the surrogate mother and her husband.
</P>
<P>
	   Home Secretary Jack Straw took into account the exceptional circumstances of
the case and the needs of the children while making his decision, his office
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Although UK law does not recognize Messrs Drewitt-Barlow as Saffron and
Aspen's parents, the Home Secretary has been in no doubt that it would not be in
the children's interests to be returned to the United States,'' the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision will allow the twins to remain in Britain or travel for short
periods. If they were to remain abroad for several years their case would be
reexamined, the Home Office said.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision also means the twins will retain citizenship in the United
States although they would be free to apply for British citizenship.
</P>
<P>
	   Drewitt and Barlow have signed a contract with a newspaper and were not
prepared to comment on the latest development, said their lawyer Alison Stanley.
</P>
<P>
	   Veronica Drewitt, the twins' grandmother, said her son was ``delighted.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He phoned me a few hours ago and said 'The children can stay.' He was
hysterical,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> FDIC Proposes Doubling Funding  </HEADLINE>
   By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., concerned about its
biggest losses from bank failures since the early 1990s, is proposing a doubling
of the capital requirements for banks that specialize in risky loans to people
with inferior credit histories.
</P>
<P>
	   Regulators have warned that the higher-interest loans, called subprime
loans, can increase the risk of defaults for the deposit insurance fund. They
played a role in some of the eight U.S. bank failures last year. The eight
failures and another one in late 1998 cost the FDIC about $1 billion last year
-- its biggest annual hit since the regional banking crises of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   The failures, coming amid a booming economy, have worried regulators and
lawmakers. Compounding the concern, the FDIC is predicting that as many as 20
banks could go under this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Donna Tanoue, the FDIC chairwoman, floated the idea of increasing the
required capital for banks making a lot of higher-interest loans in a speech
last year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe thrifts and banks with high concentrations of subprime loans
should be required to hold more capital than the current rules now dictate. A
lot more,'' Ms. Tanoue told bankers.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, the FDIC has circulated a draft to the other federal banking agencies,
including the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,
which must all agree on a formal proposal to be put out for public comment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We know that they have a proposal out there for discussion purposes,''
David Runkel, a spokesman for the House Banking Committee, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of snowstorm-related federal government closures in Washington,
spokesmen for the FDIC and other banking agencies couldn't be reached for
comment on the proposal. It was first reported in Tuesday's editions of The Wall
Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
	   There has been disagreement over the FDIC's proposed definition of subprime
borrowers, The Journal reported. Critics of the proposal have maintained that
under the definition -- borrowers who have made two payments 30 or more days
late or one payment 60 or more days late -- many community banks that lend to
low- and moderate-income people would be adversely affected.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal applies to all forms of consumer credit, including home
mortgages, credit cards, auto loans and personal loans.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDIC says it has found about 150 banks and thrifts with significantly
high levels of subprime loans. Together, those institutions hold about 5 percent
of total banking industry assets.
</P>
<P>
	   The Banking Committee chairman, Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, recently proposed
legislation that would give the head of the FDIC more authority over troubled
banks. His proposal was prompted by the failure last fall of First National Bank
of Keystone, a large bank based in Keystone, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
	   The estimated $750 million loss to the FDIC insurance fund caused by
Keystone's failure could make it one of the 10 most expensive ever in this
country. Federal regulators, who closed the bank in September, said they found
evidence of apparent fraud that resulted in the depletion of its capital.
</P>
<P>
	   Leach has said there are indications the regulators may not have properly
supervised Keystone when it engaged in risky financial strategies, and that the
FDIC was stymied at key points by other federal banking agencies in its desire
to examine the bank's activities.
</P>
<P>
	   Leach didn't immediately return a telephone call seeking comment Tuesday on
the FDIC's proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   The bank insurance fund, which backs each account up to $100,000, has an
adequate cushion -- now some $29 billion -- to cover depositors' losses.

<HEADLINE> Right-Wing Councilman Shot in Milan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILAN, Italy (AP) -- A gunman opened fire on a right-wing city councilman in
Milan on Tuesday, hitting him once in the leg.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities expressed doubt about a claim of responsibility in the name of
Italy's armed leftist Red Brigades.
</P>
<P>
	   Emilio Santomauro, 36, was shot once below the knee as he left his office in
Milan at the end of the day. Police said at least three shots were fired. He is
a member of Gianfranco Fini's National Alliance.
</P>
<P>
	   Milan's Il Giorno newspaper received an anonymous call claiming
responsibility on behalf of the Red Brigades. Investigators were skeptical,
saying the claim came after news of the attack was broadcast and that the Red
Brigades had never been known to use the type of gun used in the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   The Red Brigades fought for the destruction of the Italian state in the
1970s and 1980s, claiming former Premier Aldo Moro as their most prominent
victim in 1978.
</P>
<P>
	   The killing of a government aide in May, claimed on behalf of the Red
Brigades, raised fears the long-dormant terror group was reawakening. Police
have yet to verify the claim or identify the killer.

<HEADLINE> Storm Dumps Foot of Snow in East  </HEADLINE>
   By ROGER PETTERSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   A surprisingly fast-moving storm blanketed the East Coast with up to 2 feet
of wind-blown snow Tuesday, closing airports and schools, paralyzing the
nation's capital and leaving North Carolina looking more like North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The snow has completely covered my car. It's gone, I can't even see it,''
Thomas Allen said in Raleigh, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   At least four people were killed in weather-related traffic accidents in the
Carolinas, and a 5-year-old girl was missing and feared dead in Massachusetts
after falling into an icy river while walking to school in heavy snow.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm even intruded on the presidential campaign. Most of the candidates
flew to New Hampshire after the Iowa caucuses, but Republican Alan Keyes got
stuck in Detroit, unable to fly into Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm -- known as a nor'easter -- drove northward along the coast, with
moist air from the ocean colliding with cold air over the land. During the
morning, snow fell from South Carolina all the way to Maine.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm raced into the Northeast with a speed that surprised forecasters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We knew it was coming. It just decided to hit us a day earlier,'' said
National Weather Service meteorologist Tim Morrin in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the third snowfall in a week for some states, but for much of the
region it was the first major storm in a season that has seen little snow. It
was also the worst snowstorm to hit the area since the blizzard of January 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Most federal agencies shut down in Washington. Legislative meetings were
called off in Delaware, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania, and Delaware Gov. Thomas
Carper had to postpone his State of the State address for the second time in a
week because of snow.
</P>
<P>
	   Schools were closed from South Carolina to Maine, including nearly all
schools in New Jersey and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourteen inches of snow had fallen by early afternoon at Petersburg, Va.,
and snow piled up in 4- to 5-foot drifts outside Richmond. A foot had fallen at
Jaffrey, N.H. The Baltimore-Washington International Airport got more than seven
inches. Ten inches had accumulated outside Philadelphia at King of Prussia, and
New York City measured 6.
</P>
<P>
	   Boston had only 3 1/2 inches, but snow up to 18 inches deep was forecast by
the end of the storm in the Berkshire hills of western Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm hit hardest in the Carolinas. North Carolina a record 20.3 inches
at the Raleigh-Durham airport.
</P>
<P>
	   The North Carolina utility CP&AMP;L had 81,000 customers without power, Duke
Power Co. reported 87,000 without power in North Carolina. About 50,000 people
were without power in South Carolina and Virginia Power reported fewer than a
thousand customers without power.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With wind gusts at 40 miles per hour, it's just not safe to have somebody
up there working on a power line in a bucket truck,'' said CP&AMP;L spokeswoman
Sally Ramey.
</P>
<P>
	   North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt declared a state of emergency, activating the
National Guard to help clear streets and rescue stranded motorists. Stalled cars
and trucks shut down five miles of Interstate 85.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There may be other snowstorms like this in Alaska or something, but never
in North Carolina,'' said Allen, the motorist whose car was buried in Raleigh,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm closed major Eastern airports, including New York's LaGuardia and
Washington Reagan National Airport, and others had delays and cancellations. US
Airways canceled all of its afternoon East Coast service between North Carolina
and New York.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think we didn't pick the best day for flying,'' Brazilian visitor Joao
Nemeth said at LaGuardia as he comforted an 11-year-old daughter who had
expected to fly to Walt Disney World.
</P>
<P>
	   A memorial service scheduled Tuesday in New Jersey at Seton Hall University
for three freshmen killed in a dormitory fire last week had to be rescheduled
because of the snow.
</P>
<P>
	   A few people appreciated the snow.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It adds beauty to this place,'' Rudolph Williams said in New York City.
``It adds life. It's creative. This here is a winter's work of art!''

<HEADLINE> Peru Drug Trafficker Said Caught  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori said Tuesday that police had
captured the chief of Peru's top drug cartel in the Amazon jungle.
</P>
<P>
	   Adolfo Cachique was arrested early Tuesday in the central jungle province of
Contamana along the banks of the Ucayali River, 355 miles northeast of Lima.
</P>
<P>
	   Fujimori described Cachique and his brothers as leading ``the most important
narcotics gang operating in Peru'' and said the alleged drug boss was a major
supplier of cocaine to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Cachique's brother, Segundo, was arrested last month in a raid on a hidden
camp near the border with Brazil. Cachique's other brother, Abelardo, was
arrested on drug charges in Colombia in 1995 and received a life sentence. One
sibling, Nicolas, remains at large.
</P>
<P>
	   In the early 1990s, Peru was the world's largest producer of coca, the raw
material used to make cocaine. But the Andean nation reduced coca production by
more than two thirds in the last five years, according to U.S. drug enforcement
officials.
</P>
<P>
	   The reduction came after Fujimori adopted tough anti-narcotics policies,
including shooting down drug planes en route from isolated camps in Peru's
Amazon to cocaine refineries in Brazil and Colombia.
</P>
<P>
	   But U.S. drug enforcement officials say the traffickers have made new
inroads, smuggling coca overland on jungle trails and by river. Drug traffickers
are also increasingly refining cocaine on Peruvian soil to feed a burgeoning
domestic market of drug users.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Grandmothers To Meet Elian  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under government orders, the Florida relatives of Elian
Gonzalez agreed Tuesday to make the boy available for a meeting with his Cuban
grandmothers Wednesday at a neutral site, the Justice Department said. The
grandmothers pressed their insistence for the boy's return and pleaded with
Congress not to force U.S. citizenship upon him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The meeting will take place at the time and site selected by the
Immigration Service,'' Justice spokeswoman Carole Florman said Tuesday evening.
The agreement culminated a long day of negotiations marked by an order from the
Immigration and Naturalization Service to hold the neutral-site meeting, that
had been thwarted on Monday by the relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Florman said the government had reassured the relatives that Wednesday's
session at the Miami Beach home of the president of a Dominican college would be
just a visit and would not result in his being taken back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers will see Elian privately, but the boy's Florida relatives
will be nearby in the house at the time, Florman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, after meeting lawmakers on Capitol Hill, Mariela Quintana, the
child's paternal grandmother, said, ``He is only a 6-year-old boy. And he's a
Cuban.'' President Clinton said he would not rule out a veto if Congress passes
the citizenship bill.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS, part of the Justice Department, ordered the boy's great-uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez, to bring Elian to a meeting with the grandmothers at an
``appropriate neutral location'' at 4 p.m. EST Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS specified that location: the Miami Beach home of Barry University
President Jeanne O'Laughlin, a sister in the Roman Catholic Dominican order.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling followed Gonzalez's rejection Monday of a meeting anywhere other
than his own home.
</P>
<P>
	   The meeting ``is only a visit'' and does not change the boy's status, said
the letter signed by Michael A. Pearson, executive associate immigration
commissioner for field operations.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS has ruled that the boy should be returned to his father in Cuba.
Elian's Florida relatives have challenged that order in federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have everybody's word that the child will not be taken away,''
O'Laughlin said in an interview with The Associated Press. ``I wouldn't
participate if that was the case.''
</P>
<P>
	   If the relatives had refused to bring the boy to the meeting, Justice
attorneys could have gone into federal court in Miami for an order directing
compliance, said department officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy was found clinging to a life preserver in the Atlantic on Nov. 25
after his mother and 10 others died when their boat sank en route from Cuba to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Carol Fouke, a spokeswoman for the National Council of Churches, which
sponsored the grandmothers' trip, applauded the order for Wednesday's meeting
and said the grandmothers planned to leave Washington for Miami early Wednesday
morning, weather permitting. Washington was in the grips of a fierce snowstorm
that blanketed the area with more than a foot of snow.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers told reporters they had never seen snow before -- and were
surprised it was so cold.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the snowstorm, which closed many congressional offices, the two
women made the rounds of Capitol Hill on Tuesday, meeting with legislators
sympathetic to their wish to have Elian returned to his father's custody in Cuba
and their opposition to congressionally imposed citizenship on Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The only one who has a legal right with that child is his father,''
Quintana said.
</P>
<P>
	   Several Democratic senators suggested after meetings with the grandmothers
that they would wage a filibuster on the Senate floor, if necessary, to try to
block the citizenship bill.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It doesn't belong on the Senate floor,'' said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.
Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., agreed, saying, ``This boy ought to go home and
be with his father.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., and others who met with the women said the
grandmothers told them Elian's mother was on the ill-fated boat not to flee
Castro's oppression but because of pressure from her boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We asked some rather pointed questions,'' Hagel said. ``She was forced on
that boat.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, a member of the House Judiciary's
immigration subcommittee, said after her meeting with the grandmothers that she
has asked Clinton to fight the citizenship legislation, even if it means he has
to veto it. ``Elian Gonzalez is not an orphan,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers brought with them a photo album and displayed a page with
an enlarged picture of Elian's Cuban family -- minus Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   Suggesting the picture showed how much Elian was missed, Raquel Rodriquez,
Elian's maternal grandmother, said that after losing her daughter in the boat
disaster, having U.S. citizenship forced upon Elian ``would be more painful''
and prolong the agony.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have no one else,'' she said, tears streaming down her face.
</P>
<P>
	   At the White House, Clinton urged Congress to delay action until the issue
had played out in court and to think first about ``what is right for the
child.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if he would veto such a bill, Clinton said, ``I have not decided what
to do and I would not rule that out.''
</P>
<P>
	   Versions of the citizenship bill were introduced Monday in both the House

</P>
<P>
	   The measure, drafted by members of the Florida congressional delegation,
would confer U.S. citizenship on Elian, thus removing the INS jurisdiction from
the case.
</P>

	   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., a supporter of the bill, told
reporters Tuesday the Senate likely will debate the bill early next week, rather
than Wednesday as he earlier predicted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we're trying to do is find the best way to have an impartial,
nonpolitical decision made for the young boy,'' Lott said.

<HEADLINE> Empire State Building Elevator Drops  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- An Empire State Building elevator plunged 40 stories when a
cable snapped, but two people inside were saved by an emergency braking system.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was scared, terrified,'' Shamika Peterson, 20, said Tuesday. ``I thought
I was going to die.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Peterson and Joe Masoraca, who work in different offices on the 44th
floor, boarded the elevator Monday afternoon and pressed a button for the lobby.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were on our way down when all of a sudden the elevator dropped, like a
bungee jump,'' Ms. Peterson said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   The elevator dropped about 400 feet before a safety system stopped it at the
fourth floor. Maintenance workers used an adjacent elevator to guide Ms.
Peterson and Masoraca to safety.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Peterson was treated at a hospital for neck and shoulder pain and
released. Masoraca refused medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   The elevator plunge was caused by a sheared compensating cable, the wire
that adjusts the weight of the car, building spokesman Howard Rubenstein said.
The elevator passed inspection May 19, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The elevator that plunged and one other have been closed because of safety
concerns. All other operations in the New York landmark were normal Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Rebels Put Up Tough Fight  </HEADLINE>
   By YURI BAGROV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GUDERMES, Russia (AP) -- Chechen fighters fiercely resisted attempts by
Russian forces to take a strategic square in the rebel capital Grozny on
Tuesday, attacking from the front and the rear to stymie the Russians' drive.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian troops returning to Gudermes from Grozny Thursday evening said
federal forces were still at least 400 yards from Minutka Square, which has been
under siege for several days.
</P>
<P>
	   The square is near a Russian-held bridge that crosses the Sunzha River,
which runs through Grozny. If captured, it could give Russian forces leverage to
move into downtown Grozny. Capturing the capital would be the war's biggest
political prize.
</P>
<P>
	   As Russian aircraft and artillery continued their attacks in the breakaway
province's steep southern mountains, where an estimated 6,000 rebels are based,
a prominent international human rights group on Tuesday criticized Russia's
offensive.
</P>
<P>
	   The Council of Europe, the continent's highest human rights organization,
said it would debate on Thursday whether to suspend Russia over allegations its
forces have committed atrocities in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   Exclusion from the body would mark a serious setback to Russia's
post-Communist attempts to integrate with the rest of Europe, and could severely
embarrass acting President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
	   While Council members said Russia was guilty of indiscriminate bombings,
detaining innocent people and restricting refugees' freedom of movement, Russian
officials argued that Chechen rebels had committed far more serious violations
than federal troops.
</P>
<P>
	   A representative of the Federal Security Service noted that the rebels had
kidnapped 500 to 800 people, severing the fingers of some of their hostages.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Human rights are not for one group of people and not another,'' said
Alexander Kazdanovich. ``You cannot be selective.''
</P>
<P>
	   Russian ground forces moved into Chechnya in September and took much of the
republic in a steady drive. But they have faced heavy resistance in their
efforts to take Grozny, which began Dec. 25.
</P>
<P>
	   Rebels in the city, numbering at about 2,500, fire from the capital's
wrecked buildings and launch hit-and-run attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Aslanbek Ismailov, the rebel commander in Grozny, said that in some
districts of the Chechen capital his fighters have switched from trying to hold
on to fixed positions to striking Russian troops from the rear.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian soldiers in Gudermes described this strategy as the ``roach
tactic,'' saying rebels pretend to retreat, hide somewhere, and circle back.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russians claim to control most of Grozny, although troops are often
taking city blocks by day only to abandon them at night in fear of rebel
ambushes.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite claims of steady progress, the Russians still appear far from
occupying the city or defeating the rebel garrison after months of fighting.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian air force sharply increased its airstrikes against rebels. More
than 30 fortified rebel emplacements, two mobile communication centers, one
training camp, four air defense installations and seven mortar crews were
destroyed, and 100 rebels were killed, the military claimed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian aircraft continued to concentrate their fire on the rebel-held Argun
and Vedeno gorges. The Russians have been bombing the area for two weeks, trying
to dislodge the militants from their refuges on the slopes of the gorges.
</P>
<P>
	   The gorges are key corridors through the mountains that shelter rebels and
from which they can mount guerrilla attacks on the Russians.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russians believe that rebel supplies are also coming through the gorges,
some of them from Georgia, the only foreign country that borders on Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   An estimated 250,000 refugees have fled the fighting in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. refugee officials said the flow in recent days has been especially
high, with 2,000 to 2,500 Chechens crossing into the neighboring republic of
Ingushetia daily.
</P>
<P>
	   Concern over diseases, especially tuberculosis, among the refugees is
mounting, said Kris Janowski, a spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian troops entered breakaway Chechnya in September after Chechen-based
militants stormed villages in the neighboring Russian region of Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels were also blamed for a series of deadly bombings of apartment
houses in Moscow and two other cities in September.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Russian Federal Security Service spokesman Alexander Zdanovich said
Tuesday that there was not a single ethnic Chechen among 14 people suspected as
organizers of the blasts, although all suspects had been trained in Chechnya,
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian officials said 1,093 troops have died since the Chechnya ground
operation began, Interfax reported. Russia is widely believed to understate its
losses. Another 118 soldiers died in Dagestan after Chechen rebels invaded last
summer, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Japan December Trade Surplus Falls  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's trade surplus with the world fell 20 percent in
December from the year before, the government said Wednesday. The politically
sensitive surplus with the United States declined marginally.
</P>
<P>
	   The merchandise trade surplus, the measure of all goods exported by Japan
minus those imported, declined to $10.6 billion, the Finance Ministry said. The
surplus was not adjusted for seasonal factors.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan is fighting to emerge from its worst economic downturn in 50 years. It
has been under heavy pressure from the United States and other trading partners
to rein in the surplus by bolstering its weak economy to spark demand for
imports.
</P>
<P>
	   The surplus was in line with expectations. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones
Newswires and Nikkei had forecast it would be $10.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The surplus with the United States narrowed to $5.6 billion in December,
little changed from the same month last year.

<HEADLINE> Possible Head Found for Iraq Agency  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The former head of the U.N. nuclear agency, Hans Blix
of Sweden, has surfaced as a possible candidate to head the new U.N. weapons
inspection agency for Iraq, diplomats said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The French Foreign Ministry confirmed Tuesday that Blix was an unofficial
candidate and one ``with the profile we're looking for,'' said a deputy
spokesman for the ministry, Francois Rivasseau. ``I don't believe there is any
problem (with Blix).''
</P>
<P>
	   The Security Council failed last week to agree on another Swede to head the
new agency, Rolf Ekeus, who was the executive chairman of the U.N. Special
Commission for Iraq from 1991 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Both the Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency --
where Blix used to work -- were charged with overseeing the destruction of
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction in the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
	   Blix headed the Vienna-based IAEA until his retirement in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   The Special Commission fell out of favor with council members Russia, China
and France after allegations surfaced that the United States was using it to spy
on Iraq and after a commission report triggered U.S. and British airstrikes in
December 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   IAEA inspectors, who focused solely on Iraq's nuclear program, worked
separately from the Special Commission and were never as controversial.
</P>
<P>
	   In a bid to restart weapons inspections, the Security Council in December
created a new body to replace the Special Commission, called the U.N.
Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   After a monthlong search, Secretary-General Kofi Annan nominated Ekeus to
head the new agency. But Russia, China and France rejected him last week, saying
his associations with the Special Commission made him unfit to lead the new
agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy Chinese Ambassador Shen Guofang said Tuesday that his mission had
forwarded Blix's name onto Beijing and expected a response Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   He noted that after Ekeus' nomination was blocked, China said it wanted to
see some ``new faces,'' circulated as possible candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Blix fits that category, he said, adding: ``If you ask my preference, I
would rather see someone from the developing countries.''
</P>
<P>
	   The United States has indicated its support for Blix, and several western
diplomats said they believed he could have unanimous support in the council. The
issue could be raised as early as Wednesday in the council, one diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
	   Blix's emergence as a possible consensus candidate comes at a particularly
opportune time.
</P>
<P>
	   The Swede's former employer, the IAEA, on Tuesday completed a five-day,
routine inspection of Iraq's nuclear material to make sure Baghdad's stocks
aren't being used for military purposes. The team leader said Iraq's cooperation
was good.
</P>
<P>
	   The inspection, however, is unrelated to the post-Gulf War U.N. weapons
inspections. It stems from Iraq's obligations to submit to regular inspections
under nuclear non-proliferation treaties.

<HEADLINE> Qualcomm Posts Higher Profits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Wireless technology firm Qualcomm Inc. Tuesday reported
sharply higher quarterly profits as demand for its mobile phone operating chips
continued to grow.
</P>
<P>
	   The company, however, warned that chip sales growth will likely slow during
the second quarter of fiscal year 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Qualcomm posted net profit, excluding one-time charges, of $192 million, or
25 cents per share, on sales of $1.1 billion for the three months ending Dec.
26. That compares to a profit of $49 million, or 8 cents per share, on revenues
of $941 million a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   The earnings beat the 24 cents per share forecast by analysts surveyed by
First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, Qualcomm said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission that it would pay Irwin Jacobs, the chairman and chief executive
officer, a $975,000 bonus on top of his $773,085 salary.
</P>
<P>
	   Jacobs also received options to purchase 400,000 shares at $83.50 -- worth
an additional $26.2 million at Tuesday's closing stock price.
</P>
<P>
	   Qualcomm said shipments of its phone chips, which reached 14.5 million in
the first quarter, would be lower during the second quarter of 2000 as phone
manufacturers adjust inventories to meet a seasonal slowdown and to compensate
for a shortage of other parts caused by high demand.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the company said it expects to meet or exceed the 25 cents per share
it earned in the first-quarter excluding one-time charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Qualcomm shares closed at $149 up 6 percent, or $8.93 3/4, on the Nasdaq
Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   The earnings capped a successful year for Qualcomm, which saw its stock rise
steadily all year after it sold its infrastructure division to Sweden's Ericsson
and its consumer unit to Japan's Kyocera.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of the Kyocera deal, Qualcomm announced last week it was eliminating
up to 1,000 jobs.

<HEADLINE> Juvenile Offender Executed in Texas  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A man was executed by injection Tuesday for fatally
shooting a laundry clerk when he was 17.
</P>
<P>
	   Glen Alan McGinnis was convicted of shooting 30-year-old Leta Ann Wilkerson
in the head, shoulders and back while stealing $140.
</P>
<P>
	   The Vatican, the European Union, the American Bar Association and a
collection of anti-death penalty groups pleaded for the life of McGinnis, 27,
because he was a juvenile when he killed Ms. Wilkerson in 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   McGinnis said in a recent interview that he didn't want to use his difficult
childhood as an excuse for his crime.
</P>
<P>
	   After his father abandoned him, the young man lived in a one-bedroom
apartment with a mother who traded sex for crack cocaine. McGinnis was raped as
a child and beaten with an extension cord.
</P>
<P>
	   McGinnis' execution was the sixth this year in Texas. He was the eighth
juvenile offender executed in Texas since capital punishment resumed in the
1970s.

<HEADLINE> Kimberly-Clark Earnings Up 16 Pct.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DALLAS (AP) -- Kimberly-Clark Corp. said Tuesday that strong sales across
its range of paper and personal-care products pushed fourth-quarter earnings up
16 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The maker of Kleenex, Huggies, Pull Ups and other products reported
operating profits of $432.5 million, or 79 cents a share, compared to $371.5
million, or 68 cents, a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   The Irving, Texas-based company's results beat the consensus estimate of
analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial by three cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales rose 10 percent to $3.4 billion from $3.12 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Kimberly-Clark, the world's leading maker of personal paper products from
diapers and feminine hygiene goods to paper towels and medical supplies, said
sales of its health care products increased 26 percent, personal-care products
gained 12 percent, and tissue rose 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The company has grown recently through acquisitions, including last year's
$744 million purchase of Ballard Medical Products. It expanded in Europe by
paying $365 million for the tissue business of Attisholz Holding of Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
	   Europe accounted for about one-third of the company's operating profit in
the quarter, as the Attisholz acquisition helped increase tissue sales and
product improvements boosted diaper sales.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sales and operating profit hit new highs in every region of the world,"
said chairman and chief executive Wayne R. Sanders. "Looking ahead, we expect
top-line growth to continue rising 6 to 8 percent annually in our global markets
and are committed to delivering consistent double-digit earnings growth."
</P>
<P>
	   The company reported a fourth-quarter charge of $8.5 million, 2 cents a
share, for restructuring that reduced net income to $424 million, or 77 cents a
share. A $104.8 million restructuring charge lowered net income in the year-ago
quarter to $266.7 million, or 49 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, the company reported a 5.8 percent gain in net sales and a
51 percent jump in net income, to $1.67 billion, $3.11 a share, from $1.10
billion, or $2 a share in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   At 4 p.m., shares of Kimberly-Clark were down 81 1/4 cents to $62.25 on the
New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Storm Dumps Foot of Snow in East  </HEADLINE>
   By ROGER PETTERSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   A surprisingly fast-moving storm blanketed the East Coast with up to 2 feet
of wind-blown snow Tuesday, closing airports and schools, paralyzing the
nation's capital and leaving North Carolina looking more like North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The snow has completely covered my car. It's gone, I can't even see it,''
Thomas Allen said in Raleigh, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   At least four people were killed in weather-related traffic accidents in the
Carolinas, and a 5-year-old girl was missing and feared dead in Massachusetts
after falling into an icy river while walking to school in heavy snow.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm even intruded on the presidential campaign. Most of the candidates
flew to New Hampshire after the Iowa caucuses, but Republican Alan Keyes got
stuck in Detroit, unable to fly into Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm -- known as a nor'easter -- drove northward along the coast, with
moist air from the ocean colliding with cold air over the land. During the
morning, snow fell from South Carolina all the way to Maine.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm raced into the Northeast with a speed that surprised forecasters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We knew it was coming. It just decided to hit us a day earlier,'' said
National Weather Service meteorologist Tim Morrin in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the third snowfall in a week for some states, but for much of the
region it was the first major storm in a season that has seen little snow. It
was also the worst snowstorm to hit the area since the blizzard of January 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Most federal agencies shut down in Washington. Legislative meetings were
called off in Delaware, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania, and Delaware Gov. Thomas
Carper had to postpone his State of the State address for the second time in a
week because of snow.
</P>
<P>
	   Schools were closed from South Carolina to Maine, including nearly all
schools in New Jersey and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
	   Up to 17 inches of snow fell in parts of Virginia. The Baltimore-Washington
International Airport got more than 7 inches. Ten inches had accumulated outside
Philadelphia at King of Prussia, and New York City measured 6.
</P>
<P>
	   Snow up to 18 inches deep was forecast by the end of the storm in the
Berkshire hills of western Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm hit hardest in the Carolinas. North Carolina got a record 20.3
inches at the Raleigh-Durham airport.
</P>
<P>
	   The North Carolina utility CP&AMP;L had 81,000 customers without power, Duke
Power Co. reported 87,000 outages in North Carolina. About 50,000 people were
without power in South Carolina and Virginia Power reported fewer than a
thousand customers in the dark.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With wind gusts at 40 miles per hour, it's just not safe to have somebody
up there working on a power line in a bucket truck,'' said CP&AMP;L spokeswoman
Sally Ramey.
</P>
<P>
	   North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt declared a state of emergency, activating the
National Guard to help clear streets and rescue stranded motorists. Stalled cars
and trucks shut down five miles of Interstate 85. Maryland Gov. Parris N.
Glendening also declared a state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There may be other snowstorms like this in Alaska or something, but never
in North Carolina,'' said Allen, the motorist whose car was buried in Raleigh,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm closed major Eastern airports, including New York's LaGuardia and
Washington Reagan National Airport, and others had delays and cancellations. US
Airways canceled all of its afternoon East Coast service between North Carolina
and New York.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think we didn't pick the best day for flying,'' Brazilian visitor Joao
Nemeth said at LaGuardia as he comforted an 11-year-old daughter who had
expected to fly to Walt Disney World.
</P>
<P>
	   A memorial service scheduled Tuesday in New Jersey at Seton Hall University
for three freshmen killed in a dormitory fire last week had to be rescheduled
because of the snow.
</P>
<P>
	   A few people appreciated the snow.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It adds beauty to this place,'' Rudolph Williams said in New York City.
``It adds life. It's creative. This here is a winter's work of art!''

<HEADLINE> Second Child Seperated on Cuba Raft  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN RICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARDENAS, Cuba (AP) -- Two children set out on the ill-fated boat trip that
made 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez the subject of an international struggle. The
other child also survived -- put off the boat before its final, fatal journey.
But she too faces an uncertain future.
</P>
<P>
	   Estefani Herrera is a 5-year-old girl with curly hair that flies in the wind
as she races into her grandmother's arms in front of their house on Vives
Street, roughly a mile from the house where Elian's father lives in Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
	   Her mother in Miami and her grandmother and father in Cuba all say they love
her and want to be with her. It's the sort of dilemma all-too-common for Cuban
families divided by the political wall across the Florida Straits.
</P>
<P>
	   Estefani's mother, Arianne Horta, started to take the child on an overloaded
boat to the United States in late November. But the boat had problems and had to
return to shore. Horta later decided to leave Estefani behind, hoping to send
for her later, she told a Miami news conference on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a decision that may have saved Estefani's life.
</P>
<P>
	   On the second attempt to reach the United States, the boat sank, killing 11
people, including Elian's mother. Only 6-year-old Elian, Horta, 22, and her
boyfriend Nivaldo Fernandez survived. Fernandez left a wife and two children
behind in Cuba, according to Cuba's state-run Radio Rebelde.
</P>
<P>
	   In her news conference, Horta appealed for help in reuniting with Estefani:
``From the moment she was born, she slept with me every night. Do you know how I
feel?''
</P>
<P>
	   Horta appealed for a way to bring her daughter to the United States as soon
as possible. Once she is a legal resident, she could apply to bring Estefani to
the United States. That process might keep the girl in Cuba for more than a
year, even if no one objects to her departure.
</P>
<P>
	   But back home in Cardenas, the child's grandmother and father, too, insist
they love the child and balk at the idea of giving her up, at least right now.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would not like it to be so soon,'' said the grandmother, Elsa Alfonso.
``Well, that doesn't mean that in the future I am going to refuse it because she
is her mother.''
</P>
<P>
	   The father, Victor Herrera, 33, is more certain. ``I'm the father, and she
has gone.''
</P>
<P>
	   Partly because a housing shortage often forces young married couples to
share a home with their parents, grandmothers in Cuba often play a far greater
role in child-rearing than they might in the United States
</P>
<P>
	   ``I raised my granddaughter. My granddaughter never was in anybody else's
house,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Estefani ``loves her grandmother very much,'' said the father, Herrera.
``And she also loved her mother very much. I imagine she is missing her.''
</P>
<P>
	   When he heard that her mother had fled for the United States, ``I went
quickly to the house to see if the girl was there. When I saw her, I felt such
relief,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Alfonso expressed anger at suggestions the case might be similar to that of
Elian, whose great-uncle in Miami is trying to prevent the child from being
returned to his father and grandparents in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That is criminal,'' she said. ``They are going to deny him a right to a
future.''

<HEADLINE> Man Accused of Killing 2nd Family  </HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH ALTMAN Jr. Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- Authorities thought former police officer Paul Harrington
could lead a normal life after he spent two months in a psychiatric facility for
killing his wife and two children.
</P>
<P>
	   But 24 years later, Harrington ran out of medication, and police say he shot
his second wife and their 3-year-old son to death too.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The same thing happened in 1975,'' he told police. ``They should have put
me away then.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Oct. 15, Harrington's wife of 17 years, Wanda, and their 3-year-old son,
Brian, lay dead on a couch in their Detroit duplex. Wanda had been shot in the
temple while she slept. Brian had been shot three times in the head.
</P>
<P>
	   Harrington, 53, called 911 and waited on his porch for officers.
</P>
<P>
	   He is being held without bond on murder charges. On Monday, a judge ordered
him to stand trial after a psychiatrist said Harrington is competent.
</P>
<P>
	   The previous shooting was strangely similar.
</P>
<P>
	   Harrington, a Vietnam veteran, had been a Detroit police officer since 1972.
On Dec. 19, 1975, Harrington -- recently separated from his 28-year-old wife,
Becky -- killed her and their two daughters, Pamela, 9, and Cassandra, 4, with
his service revolver.
</P>
<P>
	   Within minutes, Harrington turned himself in and took police to the murder
scene.
</P>
<P>
	   Donald Cutler, Harrington's defense attorney in that case, said he quickly
realized his client was mentally disturbed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One evening at mealtime ... a phone rang, and he apparently had a
flashback of what he called `incoming mail,' and he thought he was under attack
from the Vietcong,'' Cutler said. ``He took his service revolver he had with him
and started shooting.''
</P>
<P>
	   A judge found Harrington innocent by reason of insanity in 1977 and sent him
to a state hospital. Doctors released him after two months -- the maximum
allowed by law.
</P>
<P>
	   Harrington was fired from the police force when he was charged with the
triple homicide. But after his release from the state hospital, his life
improved; he remarried and had two more children.
</P>
<P>
	   It isn't clear whether his second wife knew that Harrington had killed his
first family. A woman who answered the phone at Ms. Harrington's brother's house
Tuesday wouldn't take a message for him.
</P>
<P>
	   Harrington ``went on with his life, tried to work,'' said W. Frederick
Moore, the attorney defending Harrington against the latest charges.
</P>
<P>
	   But Harrington started having financial trouble. He was fired in April from
his job at Hercules Drawn Steel in Livonia, where he worked for six years.
</P>
<P>
	   Detroit police Detective Sgt. Felix Kirk testified at a preliminary hearing
that Harrington had run out of medications for his severe depression. The drugs
``keep me from hearing voices,'' Harrington told police.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Had he been on his medication and had he had a (mental health) facility to
utilize, probably it would have never happened again,'' Cutler said.
</P>
<P>
	   Harrington had not slept for four nights when he decided to kill his wife
and son, he told investigators. That night, he borrowed a gun from a friend
police have yet to identify.
</P>
<P>
	   Harrington waited until the next morning, when ``everything seemed all
right, but then in my head I just couldn't handle it any more,'' he told police.
</P>
<P>
	   After his 15-year-old son, Paul Jr., left for school, Harrington shot Wanda
and Brian, authorities said. Harrington indicated he would have shot the older
boy had he been home, prosecutor Ralph Elizondo said. The boy now is staying
with his mother's relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Both prosecutors and defense attorneys said they expect the case will center
on Harrington's mental state and psychiatric testimony.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People would probably suggest he did it then (in 1975), so he thought
about it beforehand,'' Moore said. ``I'd suggest he had issues from the past
that reared their head again. He was taking medication, he was fired from his
job, which suggests that he returned to his previous state of mind.''
</P>
<P>
	   If Harrington again is found innocent by reason of insanity, he again would
be sent to a psychiatric facility and would be released in two months, Moore
said.
</P>
<P>
	   But a judge or jury now has another option that was unavailable in 1977 -- a
verdict of guilty but mentally ill, Elizondo said.
</P>
<P>
	   That would send Harrington to a mental health facility until he is suited to
be transferred to prison, where he would serve a life sentence without the
possibility of parole.

<HEADLINE> Amgen Reports Earnings Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (AP) -- Amgen earnings rose 18 percent during the
fourth quarter, capping a year of record growth for the biotechnology company
and beating Wall Street's expectations by a penny a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Amgen reported Tuesday that it earned $282 million, or 26 cents per share,
up from $239 million, or 22 cents per share during the fourth quarter of 1998.
Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had estimated earnings for the
quarter ended Dec. 31 would be 25 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales increased 22 percent during the quarter to $847 million.
</P>
<P>
	   On the year, Amgen's earnings rose 27 percent to $1.1 billion, or $1.02 per
share, from $863 million, or 82 cents per share, largely on increase sales of
its bread-and-butter drugs, Epogen and Neupogen. Revenues were $3.04 billion, up
21 percent from $2.51 billion for all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales of Epogen, used to stimulate red cell production in chemotherapy and
kidney dialysis patients, were up 27 percent to $1.7 billion. Sales of Neupogen,
which boosts production of white cells, rose 13 percent to $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   It was "an extraordinary year for Amgen and our shareholders," said Gordon
Binder, chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
	   Overstocking by wholesalers worried about potential Y2K problems accounted
for 2 cents per share of the full year's earnings.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Amgen rose 12 1/2 cents to $69.37 1/2 at the close of regular
trading Tuesday on the Nasdaq Stock Market. However, the shares fell as low as
$65.50 in after-hours trading.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks rose in early trading Wednesday as investors
cheered a moderate rise on Wall Street. The dollar was higher against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average added 191.55 points, or 1.01
percent, to 19,087.08. On Tuesday, the average closed down 161.18 points, or
0.85 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar was fetching 105.94 yen in early trading, 0.10 yen higher than
its level of 105.84 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo and above 105.89 yen late in New
York trading.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, high-tech and telecommunications shares such as Sony
Corp. and Nippon Telegraph &AMP; Telephone Corp. paced gains by Tokyo stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors were reassured by advances posted on Wall Street, where the Dow
Jones industrial average shook off concerns about a possible U.S. interest-rate
hike to rise 21.72 points to 11,029.89. U.S. stocks rose as investors rewarded
companies that posted strong earnings reports for the final quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   But the session was volatile, reflecting concerns that corporate profits may
be pinched if U.S. monetary authorities raise interest rates to head off
inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all first-section companies was up
21.54 points, or 1.3 percent, at 1,654.11. The TOPIX fell 15.39 points, or 0.93
percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency trading, the dollar was still getting some support from a
statement issued over the weekend by Group of Seven finance officials expressing
shared concern about the strong yen, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders were also awaiting U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's
scheduled address later Wednesday before the Senate Banking Committee on his
renomination to a fourth term as Fed Chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan was originally scheduled to speak late Tuesday, but his appearance
was postponed because of snowy weather in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 105.92 yen, down from 106.60 yen
late Tuesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.6550
percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.6250. Its price fell 0.27 point to 101.25.

<HEADLINE> Militant Kashmiris Plan Fundraising  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHY GANNON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- A militant group waging war against India in
Kashmir announced a fundraising drive Tuesday to buy arms and ammunition for
guerrilla groups.
</P>
<P>
	   The fundraising drive will begin Feb. 5, which the Al-Badr group has
declared ``Solidarity with Kashmir Day,'' when they will solicit financial
support for the rebel insurgency in Indian-ruled Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
	   Al-Badr is one of the larger and more active militant groups waging a bloody
secessionist movement in Indian-ruled Kashmir. Al-Badr wants a united Kashmir to
merge with Islamic Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   Both India and Pakistan rule part of Kashmir, a former princely state during
British rule of the subcontinent. When the British left behind an independent
subcontinent in 1947, the two countries each took part of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then they have been fighting over who should own a united Kashmir. The
dispute has caused two wars between India and Pakistan, who declared themselves
nuclear powers in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   India accuses Pakistan of fomenting violence in Indian-ruled Kashmir.
Pakistan says its support is diplomatic and that it only wants to press for the
implementation of a United Nations resolution calling for Kashmiris on both
sides of the disputed border to decide whether to join India or Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
	   India refuses to accept the resolution.
</P>
<P>
	   Following last month's hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane, relations
between India and Pakistan have nose-dived. In addition, cross-border attacks
between the two armies has increased.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Tuesday, Pakistani police said they believe Indian soldiers were
involved in the killings early in the day of four people, including an infant,
in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
	   The victims, three women and a child, were killed in their home in a village
barely 100 feet from the disputed border with India, said Shaukat Majeed, deputy
commissioner of the region.
</P>
<P>
	   Police believe Indian soldiers slipped across the border into Pakistan and
returned after the killing, said Majeed. It was unclear what evidence was
available that implicated Indian troops and Indian officials were not
immediately available to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, both countries accused one another of crossing the disputed
border to launch an attack.

<HEADLINE> Church of England Mulls Remarriage  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BARR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- The Church of England, established by the much-wedded King
Henry VIII, took a step Tuesday toward approving remarriage for divorcees -- an
issue that may be of keen interest to Britain's next king.
</P>
<P>
	   Recommendations published by a group of bishops, if adopted by the church's
governing General Synod in 2002, could make it easier for Prince Charles to
contemplate marriage to his longtime love, Camilla Parker Bowles.
</P>
<P>
	   But the church's main concern is dealing with the realities of a nation with
one of the highest divorce rates in Europe. Roughly one-third of Anglican
priests already remarry divorcees, and the church says 10 percent of its
marriages now involve divorcees.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If these proposals win acceptance, the church will not simply marry anyone
who turns up and asks to be married,'' said the Right Rev. Michael Scott-Joynt,
bishop of Winchester and chairman of the bishops' working party on remarriage.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the conditions: Divorced people should be honest about the reasons for
the failure of their previous marriage, adequate provision should be made for
supporting children, the new relationship should not be the cause of breaking up
the previous marriage, and ``a reasonable time'' should have passed since the
divorce.
</P>
<P>
	   Bishops also recommended that remarriage should normally not be permitted
for people who have been involved in more than one divorce.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision in each case would be made by the local priest in consultation
with the bishop. The recommendations say that no priest should be compelled to
preside at a remarriage against his or her conscience.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This report in effect codifies what has already become practice in many
parishes,'' said the Right Rev. Mark Santer, bishop of Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposals would have to be approved by two-thirds majorities in all
three houses of the General Synod -- bishops, clergy and lay members.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1981, the General Synod adopted a resolution affirming its belief that
``marriage should always be undertaken as a lifelong commitment,'' but noted
that circumstances exist in which it would be right for a divorced person to
remarry in church while the former partner remains alive.
</P>
<P>
	   At a news conference announcing the recommendations, church officials
refused to be drawn into comment on the case of Prince Charles, who is next in
line to succeed Queen Elizabeth II as monarch and temporal head of the church.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles, who has been free to remarry since former wife Princess Diana died
in a 1997 car crash, has said he has no intention of doing so. Under current
rules, however, he could not marry Mrs. Parker Bowles because she is a divorcee
and her husband is still alive.
</P>
<P>
	   He has acknowledged adultery with Mrs. Parker Bowles while they each were
still married. Diana blamed Mrs. Parker Bowles for the dissolution of her
marriage, but Charles has said he was faithful to Diana until their marriage
broke down.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly 40 percent of marriages in England and Wales end in divorce -- one of
the highest rates in Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   The church, which broke from Rome because of King Henry VIII's wish to be
freed of his first wife, has officially barred second weddings in church for
divorcees since the 17th century.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1955, the queen's sister, Princess Margaret, decided against marrying the
man she loved, Group Capt. Peter Townsend, because he was divorced. The queen's
uncle, Edward VIII, abdicated in 1936 to marry a twice-divorced American, Wallis
Simpson.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles' divorced sister, Princess Anne, married her second husband in the
Church of Scotland, a Presbyterian church that is not part of the Anglican
Communion.
</P>
<P>
	   The bishops' recommendation applies only to churches in England. Other
Anglican churches around the world are free to set their own policy, as they
have done on the issue of ordaining women. In the United States, for instance,
the Episcopal Church has long performed marriages for divorced members with few
restrictions.

<HEADLINE> Nun To Mediate Cuban Boy Meeting  </HEADLINE>
   By MADELINE BARO DIAZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin has a history of helping
immigrants from Haiti, Romania, China and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   So when negotiations over a visit between Elian Gonzalez and his
grandmothers came to a standstill, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno called
O'Laughlin for help.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am very hopeful that the process can continue and that we will find a
way to bring healing and reconciliation and some closure to this very human
concern,'' O'Laughlin said Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian, the 6-year-old Cuban boy in the middle of an international custody
battle between his father in Cuba and Miami relatives, will meet with his
grandmothers on Wednesday at the Miami Beach home O'Laughlin shares with two
other nuns.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Laughlin, 70, said her role will be to be the ``welcomer'' and ``hugger.''
Both sides of the family have agreed to the visit.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmotherly O'Laughlin, known as ``Sister Jeanne,'' has been the
president of Barry University in Miami Shores for 18 years. She has also been a
longtime community activist who is no stranger to delicate situations involving
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1982, she volunteered to help 600 Haitian immigrants assimilate into the
community when they were released from an Immigration and Naturalization Service
Detention Center. She took responsibility for about half of them.
</P>
<P>
	   She has also intervened on behalf of Chinese and Romanian immigrants, among
others. She has helped some enroll in university classes and found some jobs at
the school.

<HEADLINE> Progress Reported in Biosafety Deal  </HEADLINE>
   By MATT CRENSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTREAL (AP) -- Negotiators made progress Tuesday toward resolving some of
the issues that have blocked a treaty on international traffic in genetically
modified organisms, delegates to a U.N. conference said in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The sun may just be starting to peek through in these negotiations,'' said
David Sandalow, who heads the U.S. delegation.
</P>
<P>
	   Delegates reported progress in how the protocol would apply to commodity
shipments, and which types of genetically modified products would be exempt from
the rules.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now I think we are around 80 percent, at least on commodities,'' said
Matthias Jorgenson, a delegate for the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   For almost a year, the Biosafety Protocol has been vexed by disagreements
pitting developing nations against the United States and a handful of other
agricultural exporters. Meetings in Cartagena, Colombia in February broke off
after six countries, including the United States, blocked a draft that was
approved by the other 125 delegations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The outcome here could be even more positive than the proposal that didn't
make it in Cartagena,'' Canadian head delegate Richard Ballhorn said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Canada is one of the five countries that joined the United States in
opposing the Cartagena agreement. The other four are Argentina, Chile, Uruguay
and Australia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Canada has allowed itself to be a mouthpiece for the United States,'' said
Jo Dufay, a campaign coordinator for the Council of Canadians. ``It's
shameful.''
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiators agreed Tuesday to begin discussing how the U.N. protocol would
relate to the World Trade Organization and other international agreements --
possibly the thorniest issue on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States prefers a treaty that would allow countries to refuse
genetically modified products only if a scientific risk assessment showed that
environmental damage could occur, much as World Trade Organization rules
currently do. But developing countries and environmentalists would like to see a
broader agreement that gives countries the right to refuse shipments of
genetically modified products simply because their environmental effects are
unknown.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's still in its infancy,'' said Peter Hardstaff of the Royal Society for
the Protection of Birds.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmentalists worry that genetically modified organisms could wreak
havoc on the environment. If genetically modified crops were to escape into the
environment they could outcompete native plants, spread resistance to pesticides
and antibiotics to weeds and pests, or expose beneficial organisms to toxins.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, a Cornell University study found that monarch butterflies are
poisoned by corn that is genetically modified to produce Bt toxin, a natural
pesticide.
</P>
<P>
	   Genetically modified food products are already an enormous business. In the
U.S., a large percentage of crops are already genetically engineered, and an
estimated 70 million acres of modified crops were planted worldwide in 1999.
Genetically engineered fish, trees and bacteria are also entering the
marketplace.

<HEADLINE> Yeats' Final Dublin Home Defended  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) -- A group of academics and writers is appealing to
Dublin authorities to stop poet William Butler Yeats' last home in Ireland from
being demolished.
</P>
<P>
	   A property developer who bought Riversdale House in suburban south Dublin,
where Yeats lived off and on from 1933 until his death six years later, is
seeking permission to demolish the early 19th-century building and build an
apartment complex on the four-acre site.
</P>
<P>
	   The group opposed to the proposal, led by Yeats biographer Terence Brown,
says the government should purchase the picturesque cottage and meld it into
plans to develop an Irish Academy for the Performing Arts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To allow the destruction of this literary landmark would be obscene, and
it is the kind of obscenity we have witnessed too often already,'' said Brown,
professor of modern English literature at Trinity College Dublin.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the government's arts and heritage minister, Sile de Valera,
said the South Dublin County Council was primarily responsible for deciding
whether Riversdale should be torn down or placed on the Record of Protected
Structures. The county council declined immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
	   References to Riversdale's wildlife and views of the Dublin Mountains and
Dublin Bay crop up in several entries in Yeats' final collection of work, ``Last
Poems,'' which was published in 1938.
</P>
<P>
	   He generally spent only his summers there, preferring the French Riviera,
the Spanish island of Mallorca and London in other seasons.
</P>
<P>
	   Yeats helped found Ireland's national theater and became a senator after the
country won independence from Britain in 1922. He received the Nobel Prize for
Literature in 1923.

that determine the subsidies companies receive to keep phone service affordable
in rural and expensive-to-serve areas.
</P>
<P>
	   The 5th U.S. Court of Appeals rejected a challenge to the 1997 Federal
Communications Commission rules by a number of local telephone providers, who
serve predominantly small towns and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission had crafted the rules to balance dual objectives laid out in
a landmark telecommunications law passed a year earlier: to keep phone service
affordable through the use of subsidies while promoting competition in the local
phone market.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies had argued that the FCC's changes in the subsidy system would
make it hard for local phone providers to earn a fair return on their
investments and would discourage future investments.
</P>
<P>
	   But in a boost for regulators, the three-judge panel said that the
commission's rules were reasonably tailored to achieve the twin goals laid out
by the 1996 Telecommunications Act.
</P>
<P>
	   The court said that the companies did not understand the primary goals of
the law, ``to herald and realize a new era of competition in the market for
local telephone service while continuing to pursue the goal of universal
service.''
</P>
<P>
	   Federal law mandates that companies get sufficient support to provide
affordable service in markets in which they compete for customers, the court
noted. But those challenging the FCC rules have confused that ``with a guarantee
of economic success for all providers, a guarantee that conflicts with
competition.''
</P>
<P>
	   In its rules, the FCC made a number of modifications to the subsidy system
-- which had evolved in a monopoly phone market -- so that it would be
compatible as more competitors provided local phone service.

<HEADLINE> Vermonters Have Say on Gay Marriage  </HEADLINE>
   By ROSS SNEYD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- A raging snowstorm couldn't keep more than 1,000
people from streaming into the Statehouse Tuesday to weigh in on the debate over
gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
	   Fewer than half that number were able to get into the House chamber where
two committees gave people their first opportunity to comment on last month's
state Supreme Court ruling that said gay couples must be given the benefits of
marriage.
</P>
<P>
	   The debate was civil, but emotional.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Vermont is famous for maple syrup, cheese, scenic beauty and traditional
values,'' said Ruth Goodrich. ``Is this (gay marriage) what we want Vermont to
be famous for?''
</P>
<P>
	   Lee Moffatt of Colchester said he and his male partner deserve the same
rights as opposite sex couples. ``I, too, represent the face of Vermont.''
</P>
<P>
	   People wore their opinions on their lapels, with hundreds of pink circles
declaring ``I Support The Freedom to Marry'' mixing with hundreds of blue ovals
stating ``Don't Mock Marriage.''
</P>
<P>
	   People unable to squeeze into the House chamber crammed into hearing rooms
to listen to testimony as it was piped through the building.
</P>
<P>
	   Gays and lesbians said they no longer want to be second-class citizens and
those opposed to gay marriages cited scripture and the importance of a
traditional family to make their case.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Homosexuals should be protected from attack on their personal freedom,''
said Chris Bixby, who said he opposed gay marriage and believed the voters
should decide the issue. ``Marriage is not a civil right.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers heard a variety of suggestions, ranging from granting gays and
lesbians the right to marriage, creating a domestic partnership system or
adopting a constitutional amendment defining marriage as a union between a man
and a woman.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to sit anywhere on the bus I choose to sit,'' said Laurie Morrison,
referring to the conclusion of some that a domestic partnership system would be
similar to the separate-but-equal laws that grew up as blacks sought the right
to vote in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Bill O'Leary of the Vermont State Police said there were as many as
1,500 people in and around the Statehouse, but all were well behaved. ``I can't
believe how respectful this crowd is,'' he said. ``What a credit to the people
attending here.''
</P>
<P>
	   The court said gay couples are being unconstitutionally denied the benefits
of marriage. But the justices left it up to the Legislature to decide whether to
legalize gay marriage or approve some kind of domestic partnership instead.
</P>
<P>
	   The Roman Catholic Diocese had planned a silent vigil outside the Statehouse
but canceled because the chartered bus company it had hired refused to carry
protesters to Montpelier during a snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
	   Confirming a split that many legislators have sensed since the court ruled,
a new poll showed 52 percent of those surveyed opposed the Supreme Court ruling,
while 38 percent agreed and 10 percent said they weren't sure. The poll of 623
registered voters had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Thomas Little, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, expects to
begin drafting a bill by early next month and hopes to get it through the House
by the beginning of March.
</P>
<P>
	   That would give the Senate about a month to consider it before the
Legislature's mid-April adjournment.

<HEADLINE> Judge Dismisses Rodney King Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by Rodney King
against a former lawyer accused of mismanaging the $3.8 million settlement
awarded to King for a police beating caught on video and broadcast worldwide.
</P>
<P>
	   Superior Court Judge Ann Kough on Friday dismissed the case against attorney
Steve Lerman. The judge ruled that King's 1996 lawsuit seeking more than $1
million from Lerman was filed after a one-year statute of limitations had
expired.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He had a bogus case against me and I would've been vindicated at trial,''
Lerman said Tuesday. ``I helped him become a civil rights symbol. When he said,
'Can we all just get along?' that was at the back of my building.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lerman represented King shortly after his 1991 beating by Los Angeles police
officers was caught on videotape. Riots erupted in Los Angeles in April 1992
when four of the officers were acquitted in neighboring Ventura County.
</P>
<P>
	   Two officers were later convicted in federal court in Los Angeles of
violating King's civil rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Renee Campbell, an attorney for King, said her client would appeal.

<HEADLINE> Britain Lets Gay Couple's Twins Stay  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Surrogate twins brought into Britain by a gay couple have been
given permission to stay indefinitely, the Home Office said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The twins were born Dec. 9 to a surrogate mother in Modesto, Calif. with the
help of an American egg donor and an American surrogate mother. Sperm was taken
from one of the British partners.
</P>
<P>
	   The fathers, Barrie Drewitt, 35, and Tony Barlow, 32, won a landmark case in
California to have their names recorded on the birth certificates as parents of
the twins. Under British law however, the legal parents of twins Saffron, a
girl, and Aspen, a boy, are still the surrogate mother and her husband.
</P>
<P>
	   Home Secretary Jack Straw took into account the exceptional circumstances of
the case and the needs of the children while making his decision, his office
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Although UK law does not recognize Messrs Drewitt-Barlow as Saffron and
Aspen's parents, the Home Secretary has been in no doubt that it would not be in
the children's interests to be returned to the United States,'' the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision will allow the twins to remain in Britain or travel for short
periods. If they were to remain abroad for several years their case would be
reexamined, the Home Office said.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision also means the twins will retain citizenship in the United
States although they would be free to apply for British citizenship.
</P>
<P>
	   Drewitt and Barlow have signed a contract with a newspaper and were not
prepared to comment on the latest development, said their lawyer Alison Stanley.
</P>
<P>
	   Veronica Drewitt, the twins' grandmother, said her son was ``delighted.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He phoned me a few hours ago and said 'The children can stay.' He was
hysterical,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> GOP Nomination Fight Shifts to N.H.  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NASHUA, N.H. (AP) -- George W. Bush said Tuesday he looked forward to a
``spirited contest'' for New Hampshire votes as his chief GOP rival John McCain
declared himself more prepared to lead and Steve Forbes said he was the
``authentic conservative'' in the race.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, who limped out of Iowa's Monday night caucuses with a
slim 1 percent of the vote, planned to drop out of the nominating contest on
Wednesday, an aide said, leaving a five-man Republican field with Gary Bauer and
Alan Keyes still in the race.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, who won Iowa's contest -- the first voting of the campaign season --
with 41 percent of the vote called the outcome a ``good beginning'' for his
front-running campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The people of Iowa heard my message and I believe the people of New
Hampshire will as well,'' the Texas governor said at a Bedford stop. ``It is
going to be a spirited contest here.''
</P>
<P>
	   Calling himself the ``authentic conservative'' in the race, Forbes sought to
capitalize on his unexpectedly strong showing in Iowa with 30 percent of the
vote for a second-place finish.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Republican establishment has met its match,'' Forbes said at a news
conference in Nashua.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes said he was not worried about his distant third-place standing in the
New Hampshire polls because surveys in Iowa also showed him doing poorly there.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think we are going to have a dramatic three-way race in New Hampshire,''
Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush rejected the notion that Forbes is a threat and said he would focus on
beating McCain, who is leading Bush in New Hampshire polls after skipping Iowa
to concentrate on the Granite State.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Obviously, the race in New Hampshire is with John McCain,'' Bush told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. McCain of Arizona called himself the most qualified GOP candidate for
the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am fully prepared to be president of the United States -- more prepared
than any other candidate,'' he told reporters, without naming any names.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who has emphasized campaign finance reform, said Monday's Supreme
Court decision ``vindicated'' his crusade to rid the nation of big money
politics. By 6-3 vote, the justices reaffirmed states' power to impose limits on
political campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Not only vindicated, but this is what the whole campaign was about, is
about,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   Abortion, a hot-button topic in Republican politics, helped Forbes win
conservative votes in Iowa with his flat anti-abortion stance. Bush also faced
questions three days in a row last week on the topic, and at one point said he
supports the Republican anti-abortion platform -- although it doesn't allow for
exceptions he backs in cases of rape, incest or to save the mother's life.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, asked Tuesday whether he would favor changing the abortion ban in
the GOP platform to allow such abortion exceptions, said, ``I would support the
change.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``That is the position of (Rep.) Henry Hyde, who is a leader of the pro-life
movement,'' McCain told reporters in Sunapee, N.H., although he declined to say
whether he would actively seek such a change.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if he was worried about competition from Forbes, McCain said: ``The
more the merrier.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., dismissed Forbes'
Iowa showing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This was his high water mark. He'll go down, hopefully fast,'' Lott
predicted. ``What is he, publisher of a magazine? Great ... Alan Keyes is more
qualified to be president than he is.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and McCain have argued about their rival tax plans, with the Texas
governor looking for a new line of attack nearly every day. On Tuesday, Bush
pointed to new government projections of a possible $1.9 trillion surplus over a
decade, and said he would use half that for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The difference between that and Senator McCain's plan is that 25 cents of
the proverbial dollar goes to tax cuts under my plan, and five cents under his
-- and therein lies one the debates of this campaign,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said Bush ``can't win'' with the tax debate because too many details
confuse people.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you can't win on the big issues, then go into the details,'' McCain
said dismissively.
</P>
<P>
	   Later in Londonderry, N.H., McCain outed ``shills'' in the audiences of many
of his town hall meetings who ask him soft questions, such as whether he might
elaborate on his pledge to ban the taxation of purchases over the Internet.
Aides said they were not plants, but members of Citizens for a Sound Economy,
who follow McCain around New Hampshire on their own. The Washington group
campaigns for lower taxes and less government.
</P>
<P>
	   A blizzard that dumped nearly a foot of snow clogged the campaign trail as
GOP contenders struggled to pack campaign events into the one day between Iowa
and their debate Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Barbara Fields, of Washington, N.H., advised the candidates to keep slogging
through the snow.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People here like to talk to them one on one, themselves, so in that way I
think it's different than Iowa,'' Fields, 68, said after loading friends into
her husband's truck for the 10-mile trip to see McCain at the American Legion
hall in Hillsboro. ``If we're here, they'd better be here.''

<HEADLINE> Hearst Corp. Sweetens Examiner Deal  </HEADLINE>
    By KIM CURTIS AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The Hearst Corp. is making a new effort to find a
buyer for the San Francisco Examiner, adding trucks, printing presses and other
assets to the deal along with the newspaper's name and subscriber list.
</P>
<P>
	   Examiner publisher Timothy O. White said Tuesday the offer was sweetened to
hasten the sale of the paper and alleviate antitrust concerns from local, state
and federal officials about Hearst's proposed purchase of the paper's longtime
rival, the morning San Francisco Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel that the logjam we have lived with for five months is being broken,"
White told the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
	   In August, Hearst said it planned to buy the Chronicle, reportedly for $660
million, and sell the afternoon Examiner, but only its name and goodwill, not
the physical assets needed to put out a paper. If no qualified buyer were found,
Hearst said it would merge the two newspapers.
</P>
<P>
	   The original offer attracted no buyers, White said Tuesday. "Whether this
was seen as a phony offer or sham ... this should set those criticisms aside,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department is continuing its investigation, spokeswoman Gina
Talamona said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Stephen Barnett, a professor at the University of California's Boalt Law
School and expert on newspaper competition issues, said the change in terms
"creates a more realistic chance of selling the Examiner."
</P>
<P>
	   For the public, he said, "It means there is a chance of not only continuing
to have two daily papers, but having two daily papers that really compete with
each other."
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1965, the papers have been subject to a joint operating agreement,
employing separate news staffs and competing for stories, but sharing printing
and business operations and profits. The San Francisco JOA expires in 2005, but
last year the owners of Chronicle Publishing decided to sell the company's
assets.
</P>
<P>
	   Whether the JOA might be transferred to a new Examiner owner was not
specifically addressed in Hearst's statement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Knight Ridder CEO Tony Ridder said in November he might be interested in
buying the paper "if we could step into Hearst's shoes and have the Examiner and
their position in the JOA." He was traveling Tuesday and unavailable for
comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The Chronicle is the nation's 13th-largest daily newspaper, with a
circulation of 456,000. The Examiner, the flagship of the media empire William
Randolph Hearst began 112 years ago, has a circulation of 107,129 daily, and
578,541 when its news sections are combined with Chronicle features on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Peace Talks in Stalemate  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE COPANS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- With only three weeks to go before a crucial deadline in
the peace talks, Israel and the Palestinians accused one another Tuesday of not
taking the process seriously.
</P>
<P>
	   The sides had set Feb. 13 as a deadline for creating the outline of an
agreement on the thorniest issues between them, including borders, Palestinian
refugees, Jewish settlers and the fate of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
	   But Palestinian negotiator Ahmed Qureia said that after 21 meetings on the
final status talks, nothing had been achieved and it was unlikely the sides
would meet the deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe it is because the Israelis are still hesitant to proceed
seriously and to empower the delegation,'' Qureia said. Lead Israeli negotiator
Oded Eran has also said meeting the Feb. 13 deadline is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
	   Hoping to spur the peace talks, the Palestinians had proposed a summit in
Davos, Switzerland this weekend. The summit was to include Prime Minister Ehud
Barak, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and President Clinton, but the event
appeared unlikely to take place late Tuesday because Barak has all but rejected
the idea and Clinton never expressed any interest in it.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinians blamed Israel for what they called the summit's collapse,
saying Barak was ``hesitant.'' That provoked a strong reaction from Barak's
office, which said that the summit was never seriously considered.
</P>
<P>
	   The prime minister has not yet ruled out traveling to Davos but preferred
that disputes between the sides be settled on home turf, said his spokesman Gadi
Baltiansky.
</P>
<P>
	   Blaming Barak for the collapse of the summit ``does not demonstrate the
seriousness needed to ensure the success of the negotiations,'' Baltiansky said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinians want intensive U.S. involvement in the process, believing that
Clinton's eagerness for a rapid resolution will lead him to pressure Barak into
coming around to some Palestinian demands.
</P>
<P>
	   In another sign the talks were in trouble, Arafat said he would declare a
Palestinian state this year even if differences with Israel have not been worked
out.
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat has throughout the peace process used a the threat of a unilateral
declaration of statehood to press Israel into accelerating talks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This year is the year of the Palestinian state,'' Arafat said in the Gaza
Strip as he returned from talks in Cairo with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
	   Senior Palestine Liberation Organization officials warned earlier this month
that a statehood declaration could conceivably come as early as Feb. 2, when the
PLO's policy-making Central Council meets.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Arafat said Palestinian statehood would be ``one of the main
issues'' at that meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak has not objected to Palestinian statehood, but Israeli opponents to
the peace process would likely use a unilateral statehood declaration as proof
that the prime minister had lost control of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Tuesday, 5,000 protesters rallied against the Palestinians getting any
part of Jerusalem as part of any permanent peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak has pledged to keep the city undivided, but ministers close to the
prime minister have suggested that three Arab suburbs of Jerusalem could
eventually become the Palestinian capital.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Klan Leader's Home Searched  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- State investigators have searched the home of a
Mississippi Ku Klux Klan leader as part of their investigation of a threat
against state Attorney General Mike Moore.
</P>
<P>
	   Jimmie Maxey, 62, identified by Moore's office as the Imperial Wizard of the
South Mississippi Ku Klux Klan, said Tuesday that the four investigators
searched his home in Petal and confiscated a computer, Klan-related newspaper
clippings, phone lists and videotapes.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee Martin, a special assistant attorney general, said the search was in
response to threatening statements on the Web site of the Alabama White Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
	   The White Knights criticized Moore in an online article glorifying former
Mississippi Klan chieftain Sam Bowers. Bowers was sentenced to life in prison in
1998 for murdering black voting rights advocate Vernon Dahmer in 1966.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is our opinion it is Moore who has earned the death sentence for
treason against the white race,'' the article said.
</P>
<P>
	   Maxey said the diatribe against Moore by the White Knights -- a group he
says he is friendly with -- was just an opinion and not intended to be a death
threat.
</P>
<P>
	   Moore declined to comment about the search because of the ongoing
investigation.

	   Pro Sports Tax Considered
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Canadian taxpayers are indirectly subsidizing U.S. sports
stadiums through visiting player levies charged in some American jurisdictions,
KPMG accountants and two local politicians said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   They're urging provincial governments -- specifically Ontario -- to get in
the game.
</P>
<P>
	   At least three U.S. state or municipal governments currently charge visiting
Canadian team pros a percentage of their salaries based on the number of games
or number of days the visitors spend in that jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
	   The Canadians then write off the levy against their federal income tax.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As a consequence, the Canadian resident player does not suffer personally,
but Canada receives lower tax revenues -- in effect the government of Canada is
supporting the development of sport and arts facilities in the United States,''
says the report prepared by Robert Wener, a managing partner in KPMG's Ottawa
office.
</P>
<P>
	   By taxing visiting Major League Baseball, NBA and NHL players, Ontario could
pull in almost $15 million annually, said the report.

	   Banks Deny Payout for Loan Losses
</P>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- Ottawa is offering to pay higher risk premiums to cover what
one of Canada's top bankers calls ``horrendous'' student loan losses, but all
sides denied reports Tuesday of a $100 million retroactive bank bailout from
Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
	   A Globe and Mail report Tuesday said Ottawa was poised to sign an agreement
with the Royal Bank, CIBC and Bank of Nova Scotia that would include millions of
dollars in back payments to help pay for high default rates in student loans.
</P>
<P>
	   The report triggered a storm from Parliament Hill to the bank towers of
Toronto's Bay Street and across the country, as anger reignited over the banks'
presumed insensitivity to Canadians while amassing record profits of $9.1
billion last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal government issued a vehement denial of the report in a press
release late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Royal Bank chairman John Cleghorn also dismissed any suggestion that banks
would get retroactive payments for student loan losses. Under a five-year
contract with the banks, the federal government pays a five per cent risk
premium on all student loans to compensate for higher default rates. That
premium costs the government about $70 million a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Ottawa has proposed increasing the risk premiums to almost seven per cent
for public school loans and almost 23 per cent for loans to private vocational
school students.

	   Murrin Gleeful As He's Acquitted
</P>
<P>
	   VANCOUVER (AP) -- Shannon Murrin gleefully clapped his hands, exclaimed
``oh, man'' and flashed a thumbs-up Tuesday after a jury found him not guilty of
killing an eight-year-old girl in 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   Murrin, 49, was charged with first-degree murder in the death of Mindy Tran
in Kelowna, British Columbia
</P>
<P>
	   Her body was found two months later in a shallow grave in a park, but Murrin
wasn't charged until January 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Murrin, who's spent the last five years in jail, strolled out the front door
of the Law Courts building in downtown Vancouver with one of his lawyers. He got
into a car driven by his other lawyer, intending to go home to Newfoundland.
</P>
<P>
	   Murrin has a lengthy criminal record and has spent between 15 and 20 years
in prison for bank robberies and assaults.

	   Tensions Surface At Biosafety Conference
</P>
<P>
	   MONTREAL (AP) -- Sharp tensions surfaced Tuesday at the U.N. conference on
trade in genetically modified organisms, with countries failing to agree on what
the main issues are, let alone how to resolve them.
</P>
<P>
	   Canadian Richard Ballhorn, speaking for the so-called Miami Group of major
grain-exporting countries, warned delegates that Canada and its allies could be
``very severe'' if their concerns are not dealt with.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will be very difficult,'' Ballhorn said, using unusually strong
language at the United Nations gathering where debate among the about 130
countries tends to be cloaked in diplomatic niceties.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the most controversial articles in a draft agreement gives countries
the right to ban genetically altered products even when there's no scientific
certainty about their potentially harmful effects.
</P>
<P>
	   Ballhorn said the wording of the clause is unsatisfactory to the Miami
Group.
</P>
<P>
	   The purpose of the conference is to negotiate rules for the trade in
genetically modified products: everything from pest-resistant corn to
slow-ripening tomatoes. Billions of dollars in agricultural exports could be
affected.
</P>
<P>
	   The Miami Group also includes the United States, Australia, Uruguay,
Argentina and Chile.

<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks moved higher Wednesday morning as investors
cheered a moderate rise on Wall Street. The dollar was lower against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average finished the morning session up
163.63 points, or 0.87 percent, to 19,059.16. On Tuesday, the average closed
down 161.18 points, or 0.85 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar was quoted at 105.77 yen in late morning trading, 0.07 yen less
than the 105.84 yen it bought late Tuesday in Tokyo and down from 105.89 yen in

	   On the Tokyo stock market, high-tech and telecommunications shares such as
Sony Corp. and Nippon Telegraph &AMP; Telephone Corp. paced gains.

Jones industrial average shook off concerns about a possible U.S. interest-rate

Wednesday morning session up 20.26 points, or 1.24 percent, at 1,652.83. The
TOPIX fell 15.39 points, or 0.93 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency trading, the dollar's moderate retreat was limited by a
statement issued over the weekend by Group of Seven finance officials expressing
shared concern about the yen's strength, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders were also awaiting U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's
scheduled address later Wednesday before the Senate Banking Committee on his
renomination to a fourth term as Fed Chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan was originally scheduled to speak late Tuesday, but his appearance
was postponed because of snowy weather in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currency trading, the euro was quoted at 105.96 yen, down from
106.60 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.6600

<HEADLINE> Storm Dumps Foot of Snow in East  </HEADLINE>
   By ROGER PETTERSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   A surprisingly fast-moving storm blanketed the East Coast with up to 2 feet
of wind-blown snow Tuesday, closing airports and schools, paralyzing the
nation's capital and leaving North Carolina looking more like North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The snow has completely covered my car. It's gone, I can't even see it,''
Thomas Allen said in Raleigh, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   At least four people were killed in weather-related traffic accidents in the
Carolinas, and a 5-year-old girl was missing and feared dead in Massachusetts
after falling into an icy river while walking to school in heavy snow.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm even intruded on the presidential campaign. Most of the candidates
flew to New Hampshire after the Iowa caucuses, but Republican Alan Keyes got
stuck in Detroit, unable to fly into Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm -- known as a nor'easter -- drove northward along the coast, with
moist air from the ocean colliding with cold air over the land. During the
morning, snow fell from South Carolina all the way to Maine.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm raced into the Northeast with a speed that surprised forecasters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We knew it was coming. It just decided to hit us a day earlier,'' said
National Weather Service meteorologist Tim Morrin in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm system was to press toward Maine by Wednesday morning, bringing
moderate to heavy snows from Pennsylvania through New England. The Southeast was
to get a break from the heavy precipitation.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday's storm the third snowfall in a week for some states, but for much
of the region it was the first major storm in a season that has seen little
snow. It was also the worst snowstorm to hit the area since the blizzard of
January 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Most federal agencies shut down in Washington. Legislative meetings were
called off in Delaware, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania, and Delaware Gov. Thomas
Carper had to postpone his State of the State address for the second time in a
week because of snow.
</P>
<P>
	   Schools were closed from South Carolina to Maine, including nearly all
schools in New Jersey and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
	   Up to 17 inches of snow fell in parts of Virginia. The Baltimore-Washington
International Airport got more than 7 inches. Ten inches had accumulated outside
Philadelphia at King of Prussia, and New York City measured 6.
</P>
<P>
	   Snow up to 18 inches deep was forecast by the end of the storm in the
Berkshire hills of western Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm hit hardest in the Carolinas. North Carolina got a record 20.3
inches at the Raleigh-Durham airport.
</P>
<P>
	   The North Carolina utility CP&AMP;L had 81,000 customers without power, Duke
Power Co. reported 87,000 outages in North Carolina. About 50,000 people were
without power in South Carolina and Virginia Power reported fewer than a
thousand customers in the dark.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With wind gusts at 40 miles per hour, it's just not safe to have somebody
up there working on a power line in a bucket truck,'' said CP&AMP;L spokeswoman
Sally Ramey.
</P>
<P>
	   North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt declared a state of emergency, activating the
National Guard to help clear streets and rescue stranded motorists. Stalled cars
and trucks shut down five miles of Interstate 85. Maryland Gov. Parris N.
Glendening also declared a state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There may be other snowstorms like this in Alaska or something, but never
in North Carolina,'' said Allen, the motorist whose car was buried in Raleigh,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm closed major Eastern airports, including New York's LaGuardia and
Washington Reagan National Airport, and others had delays and cancellations. US
Airways canceled all of its afternoon East Coast service between North Carolina
and New York.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think we didn't pick the best day for flying,'' Brazilian visitor Joao
Nemeth said at LaGuardia as he comforted an 11-year-old daughter who had
expected to fly to Walt Disney World.
</P>
<P>
	   A memorial service scheduled Tuesday in New Jersey at Seton Hall University
for three freshmen killed in a dormitory fire last week had to be rescheduled
because of the snow.
</P>
<P>
	   A few people appreciated the snow.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It adds beauty to this place,'' Rudolph Williams said in New York City.
``It adds life. It's creative. This here is a winter's work of art!''

<HEADLINE> Consumers Affected by Fuel Costs  </HEADLINE>
    By DENISE LAVOIE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Alex Terentino feels like fuel suppliers have him
over a barrel -- twice over.
</P>
<P>
	   Terentino has seen the amount he pays for home heating oil go from 99 cents
a gallon to $1.89 a gallon in a matter of weeks, while his bill for natural gas
at his Stamford butcher shop has doubled in the last month.
</P>
<P>
	   "You've got no choice. You've got to pay," said Terentino, one of many
consumers across the country complaining about the sudden and rapid rise in fuel
costs.
</P>
<P>
	   With much of the Northeast gripped by frigid temperatures during the past
week, usage of home heating oil was way up, leading to supply shortages in some
areas.
</P>
<P>
	   In East Hartford, fire officials urged residents to lower their thermostats
to conserve fuel after a main supplier, Motiva Enterprises LLC, said it expects
to run out of oil by mid-week. Several residents in two town trailer parks went
without heat for two days when their fuel wasn't resupplied in time.
</P>
<P>
	   With supply decreasing, home heating oil prices have responded by rising
dramatically. In Connecticut, retail prices shot up at least 40 cents a gallon,
to between $1.70 and close to $2 per gallon. In Massachusetts, the average
retail price rose to $1.74 a gallon Monday, up 57 cents from a week ago and more
than double what it was this time last year. And in New Hampshire, retail prices
jumped 49 cents in six days, from $1.22 per gallon to $1.71.
</P>
<P>
	   Truckers are also feeling the pinch because of sharp increases in the costs
of diesel fuel. In New York, the retail price of diesel fuel rose from a low of
$1.349 per gallon to a high of $2.059 per gallon from Thursday to Monday,
according to the New York State Motor Truck Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Even kerosene users were seeing steep price increases. At French's Kwick
Stop, near Hegesvillle, West Virginia, kerosene prices have jumped from 99 cents
a gallon a week ago to $1.69.
</P>
<P>
	   "People are shocked. I've been here 30 years and that's the highest I've
seen it," said Donna French.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton, after being inundated with pleas for help from officials
in several states, on Tuesday directed an emergency release of home heating
assistance funds. The money was to go to Alaska and the Northeastern states
"which have experienced the greatest hardship."
</P>
<P>
	   "These funds will help keep more American families safe and warm, and we'll
get them out there just as quickly as we possibly can," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Industry analysts say the sudden price increases have been caused by several
factors, including the recent cold snap, OPEC's decision to extend existing
production cuts past an original March deadline and low petroleum supplies.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you look at global inventories, they are certainly at some of the lowest
they've been at in many years," said George Beranek, an analyst with Petroleum
Finance Co., a private consulting firm based in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
	   "The low inventories are the result of the decisions made by OPEC, however,"
he said. "It has not reached the stage where suppliers are not getting what they
need."
</P>
<P>
	   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson on Tuesday ruled out using the U.S.
strategic oil reserve to help ease the price spiral. He said, however, that he
plans to meet with oil ministers from Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Venezuela and other
countries in coming weeks to discuss oil prices and yearlong production curbs by
OPEC producers.
</P>
<P>
	   During the past year, as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries has reduced production, prices of oil and gas have skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, winter was warmer than normal, and heating oil prices remained
stable and in some cases, dropped slightly during the season. Wholesale prices
for heating oil for delivery the following month traded on the New York
Mercantile Exchange were hovering around 32 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, heating oil for February delivery closed at 90.38 cents a
gallon, off a high last week of 93.50 cents.
</P>
<P>
	   While some people accepted the supply-and-demand theory, others suggested
there is some price-gouging going on. As a result, officials in several states
are investigating the higher prices.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have clear indications that there are surcharges on bills, nondelivery
of product, possible anti-competitive actions and lack of required notices of
shortages -- all of which may show violations of law," said Connecticut Attorney
General Richard Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas Prescott, of Johnny Prescott and Son Oil Co. in Concord, N.H., said
any so-called shortage is one created to make money.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no war in the Mideast, no refineries are down, there is no major
explosion in the market," he said. "It is a normal winter in terms of degree
days, and a cold snap of six to eight days should not force prices up one
nickel."

<HEADLINE> Board Votes To Abandon School Site  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM VERDIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Unified school board voted 5-2 Tuesday
to abandon a toxic site where the nation's costliest high school was under
construction.
</P>
<P>
	   Interim Superintendent Ramon Cortines had asked board members to delay their
vote for 60 days to give the Los Angeles Unified School District more time to
study alternatives to scrapping the school.
</P>
<P>
	   Board members made their decision after presiding over a meeting that
included hours of impassioned pleas from community members who lobbied for or
against completing the high school.
</P>
<P>
	   The Belmont Learning Complex was supposed to be the crown jewel of the
nation's second-largest school district, with room for 5,300 students in a
desperately overcrowded part of downtown. Instead, construction was halted after
the district spent $170 million because of environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   The complex was built on an old oil field, and officials fear it could be
contaminated with hydrogen sulfide and methane gas that could form explosive
pockets under the foundation.
</P>
<P>
	   The debate over Belmont is one of the biggest issues in the beleaguered
district, which recently lost its superintendent, in part, because of the
Belmont debacle.
</P>
<P>
	   Stacy Torres, a senior at the old, overcrowded Belmont High School, urged
board members to complete the new campus for the next student body.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are tired of hearing unmeaningful words and false promises,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   County Supervisor Gloria Molina, who represents the area, however, urged the
board to delay action until a study is done on the costs of cleaning the site.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a community that has been waiting on empty promises for decades,''
Molina said. ``If this is a board that does not have the integrity to live up to
the promises of the past, how can we trust the promises of the future.''
</P>
<P>
	   In October, an expert panel set up just to decide what to do with the school
voted 4-3 to recommend that it be completed, with provisions made to deal with
possible environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
	   The commissioners who voted for completing the project said starting over at
a new site would cost far more, push back the opening of a new school many years
and force thousands of students to be bused from the area to other campuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Cortines proposed transforming the school into an administrative
office and warehouse, because environmental regulations for adults are not as
strict as they are for children.
</P>
<P>
	   District employees who would move to Belmont under Cortines' plan said they
feared for their safety. Neighborhood residents and students, upset by
overcrowded conditions and long bus commutes to other schools, held rallies
urging completion of the high school.
</P>
<P>
	   The teachers union opposed its completion based on safety concerns and
criticized the district for the expense, which could surpass $200 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Day Higuchi, president of the union that represents 42,000 teachers,
counselors, psychologists and other professional staff, said the money used for
Belmont could have built four high schools or 50 kindergarten through
third-grade schools to ease crowding elsewhere in the district.

<HEADLINE> Maradona Smashes Journalist's Window  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    HAVANA (AP) -- Argentine soccer star Diego Maradona, apparently angered by
constant media coverage during his stay for cocaine rehabilitation, broke a
journalist's car window on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Photographers and cameramen said they had followed Maradona to a Havana
supermarket when he got out of the black Mercedes-Benz -- which was loaned to
him by the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
	   He then confronted a cameraman and photographer from the Reuters news
agency, striking their vehicle's window with his hand and shattering the glass.
The photographer suffered a slight eye injury from the broken glass.
</P>
<P>
	   Maradona, 39, arrived in Cuba last week to undergo treatment for drug
addiction at a facility on the outskirts of Havana.
</P>
<P>
	   Maradona is accompanied by a large entourage of friends, family and trainers
in Cuba and has been visited by President Fidel Castro.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Editors Protest Editorial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Editors and reporters at The Florida Times-Union
have written a letter of protest about an editorial in the newspaper that said
slavery had "existed briefly in America" and "its effects are not permanent."
</P>
<P>
	   The Jan. 10 editorial ran under the headline "The Lingering Issue" and
questioned the need to continue affirmative action in Florida, mentioning Gov.
Jeb Bush's plan to eliminate racial preferences in state university admissions
and state contracting decisions.
</P>
<P>
	   The editorial said Congress justified affirmative action 35 years ago to
make up for past wrongs. "Among the wrongs was slavery, which existed briefly in
America but ended more than a century ago," the editorial said. "However, while
it is unfortunate that people from Africa were slaves in 18th century America,
it was not unique."
</P>
<P>
	   Citing other examples of slavery throughout history, the editorial stated:
"The evidence is rather conclusive that slavery is not unique and its effects
are not permanent."
</P>
<P>
	   Publisher Carl Cannon said Tuesday that the newspaper would run a
clarification on Wednesday. He said he had not heard any negative comments from
the public about the editorial.
</P>
<P>
	   "The editorial was not about slavery, it was about affirmative action," he
said. "If someone was offended, I am sorry for that."
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper's clarification said: "As history notes, slavery started here
in the 17th century. It did not end until the middle of the 19th century. Many
in the community feel the reference to a brief period of slavery in America was
insensitive and demeaning. That was not the intention of the editorial."
</P>
<P>
	   The letter sent by reporters and editors to Cannon and editor Pat Yack did
not protest the paper's editorial stand on affirmative action. Instead, it
accused the editorial board of being "careless with the truth," saying the
"enduring shadow of slavery, legalized segregation, existed in Jacksonville
until the 1960s."

<HEADLINE> Timberwolves 92, Rockets 84  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL A. LUTZ AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HOUSTON (AP) -- Kevin Garnett scored 27 points, including two key baskets
late, as the Minnesota Timberwolves held on to snap the Houston Rockets'
six-game winning streak with a 92-84 victory Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Timberwolves built a 70-53 lead -- their biggest of the game -- in the
final minute of the third quarter, but the Rockets twice closed the gap to five,
the last at 85-80 with 1:48 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   Garnett kept the Rockets from getting too close on a jumper with 1:58 to
play for a 85-78 lead and his basket with 35 seconds left to make it 90-82.
</P>
<P>
	   Garnett added 12 rebounds and Terrell Brandon scored 26 points with eight
assists.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Francis led Houston's fourth quarter comeback, scoring 13 of his 24
points in the final period. Cuttino Mobley had 18 points and Kenny Thomas added
17 off the bench.
</P>
<P>
	   Minnesota has won 16 of 19 games since breaking out of an eight-game losing
streak.
</P>
<P>
	   After starting slow, the Timberwolves took a 43-36 halftime lead and really
warmed up in the third quarter, hitting 13 of 19 shots with Brandon and Garnett
leading the way.
</P>
<P>
	   Minnesota scored 16 first-quarter points, tying its season-low for points in
a quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The Timberwolves trailed 18-16 before using a 9-0 spurt to begin the second
quarter for a 25-18 lead. They stayed ahead for the rest of the half.

<HEADLINE> No. 17 Texas 82 Nebraska 55  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM VERTUNO AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Lawrence Williams and Chris Mihm each scored 14 points
and No. 17 Texas held Nebraska to five points over the last 11 minutes of the
first half in an 82-55 victory Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Williams was 4-of-5 from 3-point range for Texas (13-5, 5-1 Big 12
Conference). Steffon Bradford led Nebraska (9-10, 2-4) with 13 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Long on talent under the basket, Williams and the Longhorns found their
shooting touch from the perimeter early. Texas hit five of its first six 3-point
attempts.
</P>
<P>
	   The Longhorns also forced 14 Nebraska turnovers in the first half which
Texas converted into 20 points. Texas forced 28 Nebraska turnovers for the game
as Williams also had four steals.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas looked like it could be in for a long night when Nebraska center
Kimani Ffriend caught Mihm flat-footed with a lighting quick spin move and layup
for the game's first points.
</P>
<P>
	   Ffriend also blocked Mihm's first shot attempt before the Longhorns' 7-foot
center made a layup and scored seven of his team's first 11 points.
</P>
<P>
	   The game was tied 14-14 at 12:28 of the first half when Texas caught fire
from 3-point range. Chris McColpin, Lawrence Williams and Darren Kelly each hit
3-pointers in a 13-4 run that put Texas ahead 31-18.
</P>
<P>
	   After a timeout, Ivan Wagner hit an off-balance 3 from the top of the circle
and Gabe Muoneke jammed two dunks as Texas reeled off a 14-5 run to close the
half with a 45-23 lead. Muoneke also grabbed 14 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   The Longhorns kept up the pace in the second half as Wagner and Williams hit
three straight 3-pointers to stretch the lead to 60-32. Texas held its largest
lead at 71-36 with 8:33 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   The loss left Cornhuskers coach Danny Nee one victory shy of 253 wins at
Nebraska, the school record held by Joe Cipriano (1965-80).

<HEADLINE> Penguins Saddened by Stevens Arrest  </HEADLINE>
    By ALAN ROBINSON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- There was something -- actually, someone -- missing from
the New York Rangers-Pittsburgh Penguins rivalry on Tuesday, and it bothered the
Penguins as much as it did the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
	   Kevin Stevens, a Rangers forward and a star on the Penguins' Stanley Cup
championship teams in 1991 and 1992, wasn't on the ice. He wasn't even with his
team.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, Stevens is awaiting treatment in a substance abuse facility after
being arrested early Sunday in suburban St. Louis on felony drug charges. A
prostitute who was with Stevens told police that the player purchased $500 worth
of crack cocaine before his arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   Stevens was one of the most popular Penguins ever, not just with the fans
but with his teammates, and his personal troubles clearly troubled the players
who once played alongside him.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's sad, it really is," Penguins forward Rob Brown said. "You don't want
to see anybody get in trouble. I hope it's a wakeup call and he gets the help he
needs.
</P>
<P>
	   "Maybe this will turn his life around. He's got a wonderful family."
</P>
<P>
	   Stevens has two children, and his wife is pregnant with the couple's third
child.
</P>
<P>
	   Penguins owner Mario Lemieux, who played alongside Stevens on the Penguins'
top line for nearly five years, issued a statement of support for Stevens, who
faces imprisonment if convicted of a felony.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our thoughts and prayers are with Kevin and his family," Lemieux said. "He
knows that his many friends in the Pittsburgh Penguins organization are here to
help him in any way possible during this difficult time."
</P>
<P>
	   Several players said they couldn't believe it when word of Stevens' arrest
filtered through Mellon Arena during the Philadelphia Flyers-Penguins game
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was a very good hockey player -- and a very good guy," said Penguins
captain Jaromir Jagr, whose transition to the NHL as an 18-year-old rookie in
1991 admittedly was eased by playing alongside Lemieux, Stevens and Ron Francis.
"It's too bad it happened to him."
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant coach Eddie Johnston, the Penguins general manager when he
acquired Stevens from the Los Angeles Kings in 1983, remembered how Stevens
often loosened up the locker room with his humor.
</P>
<P>
	   But he also said Stevens was a leader, such as when Stevens promised the
Penguins wouldn't lose their Wales Conference championship series against Boston
in 1991 even after they fell behind 2-0. The Penguins won the next four games.
</P>
<P>
	   Stevens had 54 goals in 1991-92 and 55 in 1992-93, when the Penguins set an
NHL record by winning 17 consecutive games. He scored 40 or more goals for four
consecutive seasons from 1990-94, finishing with 251 goals and 276 assists in
458 Penguins games from 1987-95.
</P>
<P>
	   Stevens' scoring dropped up significantly after he smacked the ice
face-first and was knocked unconscious in the Penguins' Game 7 upset loss to the
New York Islanders in the 1993 playoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the Penguins apparently were interested in reacquiring Stevens just
prior to Stevens' arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know if he was coming back, but I know that (general manager) Craig
Patrick was talking to the Rangers about some things," Johnston said. "I know
there was a possibility that he (Stevens) was going to be bought out, so there
was a possibility he might be available."
</P>
<P>
	   Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts and Rangers general manager
Neil Smith met with the Rangers to discuss Stevens' situation. They also
expressed the organization's full support, even if would seem highly unlikely
Stevens will ever play for the Rangers again.
</P>
<P>
	   "As I've said for several days now, it's really about Kevin and his family,"
Checketts said before the Rangers won their seventh in a row by beating
Pittsburgh 4-3. "The organization did the best it could. The focus is really on
him."

<P>
	   Xavier (11-7, 2-4 Atlantic 10), coming off a 31-point home loss to La Salle,

<HEADLINE> Two Killed in Colo. Avalanches  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEYSTONE, Colo. (AP) -- A skier and a snowboarder were killed in two separate
avalanches near Colorado ski areas on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   An avalanche claimed the life of a 20-year-old Breckenridge man who was
snowboarding with friends west of Arapahoe Basin. Later, an avalanche killed a
skier in an unpatrolled area on the backside of Aspen Mountain, an official with
the Pitkin County Sheriff's Office said.
</P>
<P>
	   The first fatal snowslide was reported in an area of national forest land
known as Fourth Steep Gully. The victim was snowboarding on steep, rock-lined
chutes with four friends when the avalanche was triggered, said Summit County
Sheriff Joe Morales.
</P>
<P>
	   The victim and one of his friends triggered a slide during one descent and
their second descent set off the fatal avalanche, Morales said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Apparently they thought it was pretty cool so they did it again,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Aspen avalanche occurred off ski resort territory. Further information
was not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
	   Six people have been killed in Colorado avalanches so far this winter.

	   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Vincent Yarbrough scored 17 of his 24 points in the
first half to lead No. 11 Tennessee to a 105-76 victory Tuesday night over No. 7
Auburn.
</P>
<P>
	   The Volunteers (17-2), coming off a double overtime victory against No. 10
Florida a week ago, have the best record in the Southeastern Conference and
their first 5-1 SEC start since 1988-89.
</P>
<P>
	   A crowd of 19,405 chanted "Overrated, overrated" as the Vols pulled away
from the Tigers in the second half to avenge a 28-point defeat at Auburn last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   Auburn (16-3, 4-2), which was lost in overtime to Mississippi on Saturday,
dropped back-to-back games for the first time since 1997-98, when the Tigers
fell to Mississippi in the last game of the season and to Florida in the first
round of the SEC tournament.
</P>
<P>
	   The Volunteers used a pair of 9-0 runs in the first half to take a 49-32
halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
	   The Vols shot 53 percent from the field, connecting on 36 of 67 attempts,
while the Tigers suffered through a 23-of-69 effort.
</P>
<P>
	   Yarbrough hit 8 of 16 shots, including two 3-pointers, for his 24 points. He
also had 10 rebounds, his 12th career double-double.
</P>
<P>
	   Isiah Victor added 19 points and Tony Harris, who left briefly with a
bruised knee late in the first half, finished with 18 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Auburn was led by Chris Porter with 25 points and Daymeon Fishback added 15.

<HEADLINE> Washington Subdued by Heavy Snow  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- There were no market-rattling messages from Alan
Greenspan, no speeches to Congress, not even a dribble from Michael Jordan's new
basketball team as the nation's capital was subdued by a foot of snow Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the few battles at the White House was a snowball fight outside the
West Wing between press secretary Joe Lockhart and his aides. Among the few who
made it to Capitol Hill were the two Cuban grandmothers of six-year-old refugee
Elian Gonzalez, experiencing snow for the first time.
</P>
<P>
	   The 250,000 federal workers in the D.C. area were given their first weather
day off since a January 1996 blizzard. Emergency workers and military personnel
had to find a way into work but phones went unanswered from offices of Congress
to the public affairs operation at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal agencies will remain closed on Wednesday, the Office of Personnel
Management said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jon-Christopher Bua, director of communications with the personnel office,
said the weather closure, the ninth since 1987, costs taxpayers some $60 million
in lost worktime.
</P>
<P>
	   Louis Uccelini, the National Weather Service's winter weather expert, said
that over the last 50 years there have been 28 such nor'easters that have dumped
heavy snow from Washington to Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   Reagan Washington National Airport, which handles 650 commercial flights a
day, was closed, while Dulles International Airport struggled to keep one runway
open.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., said it took him three canceled flights and eight
hours to travel from his South Carolina home on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   For those who did make it into the city, the National Gallery of Art was
closed, the Supreme Court shut its doors early, and the pro basketball game
between the New York Knicks and the Washington Wizards, under new president of
operations Michael Jordan, was canceled.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress only returned from its winter recess on Monday and had a light
schedule, but most of that was wiped out by the snow. Federal Reserve Chairman
Greenspan's testimony before the Senate Budget Committee was canceled.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., went ahead with a health committee hearing on
reducing medical mistakes, saying participants had already arrived from as far
away as California and the only person missing was a Washingtonian who couldn't
shovel a path out of his driveway.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton, who doesn't have to commute, held a news conference where
he talked about the budget and releasing emergency funds to help those hit by
the storm. He also saluted the press: ``I'm glad you all got here. I thought
school was canceled today.''
</P>
<P>
	   Those who couldn't make it to the office were apparently making a lot of
phone calls. Bell Atlantic said so many customers were trying to make calls at
the same time that it caused some congestion on the network.
</P>
<P>
	   One person who was out working was Washington Mayor Anthony Williams, who
spent much of the day riding with public works crews. He showed up for a noon
news conference riding in the front seat of a snow plow truck.
</P>
<P>
	   Past Washington governments have been criticized for responding poorly to
snowstorms, but this time they had 200 plows and trucks clearing the streets,
compared with only 30 operating during the 1996 storm.
</P>
<P>
	   But Vice President Al Gore, campaigning in a New England blizzard, joked
that he was glad to be in the snow in New Hampshire and not in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They know how to deal with snow here,'' Gore said after picking up donuts
and hot coffee for a snowplow crew at work in the Manchester area. ``In
Washington, you get one flake and forget it.''

<HEADLINE> Once is not enough: Nor'easter wallops New Jersey with snow, wind  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - A ferocious nor'easter packing gale-force
winds and up to a foot of snow slammed into New Jersey on Tuesday, delivering
another blast of winter just when it seemed like warmer days were ahead.
<P>
	   More than 10 inches of snow had fallen in parts of New Jersey by midday, and
several inches more fell Tuesday night. The afternoon brought a wintry mix of
sleet and freezing rain to many parts of the state.
</P>
<P>
	   By 7 p.m. in the southern part of the state, the precipitation had turned to
icy, stinging pellets that were painful to the skin for anyone out more than a
few minutes. That added a layer of ice to the fallen snow and a new degree of
difficulty to driving.
</P>
<P>
	   Schools, many businesses and government offices closed, and snow-covered
roads and interstates were treacherous.
</P>
<P>
	   "You don't get much more nor'easter than this," said National Weather
Service meteorologist Bill Goodman in Mount Holly.
</P>
<P>
	   Scores of cars slid off highways, collided in minor fender-benders or
endured other mishaps, including two NJ Transit buses that were stranded side by
side on the Atlantic City Expressway after one skidded onto a median and the
other got stuck after stopping to offer assistance. They were towed out.
</P>
<P>
	   A State Police trooper was carjacked when he stopped to help a motorist who
apparently skidded off the New Jersey Turnpike in Hamilton Township in Mercer
County. Unbeknownst to the trooper, the motorist was a suspect in an armed
robbery.
</P>
<P>
	   "He thought he was providing aid to a disabled motorist - just another one
of the disabled motorists you see in snowstorms like this who slide off the
road," said State Police spokesman Sgt. Al Della Fave.
</P>
<P>
	   After crashing the unmarked police car a short time later, Della Fave said,
the motorist took a second vehicle from a couple who stopped to help. They were
unhurt. The carjacker remained at large.
</P>
<P>
	   A television news van that ventured onto the Atlantic City Boardwalk made
news itself after its right rear tire broke through the walkway, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Evidently, they must have gone over some of the older boards that were
covered with snow. They had to be towed out because it got jammed in between the
boards," said police Sgt. Michael Tullio. No injuries were reported by the Fox
Network crew, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Speed limits were lowered to 35 mph on the New Jersey Turnpike and Atlantic
City Expressway.
</P>
<P>
	   Wind gusts of over 40 mph were blamed for tidal flooding in Atlantic City,
Ocean City and Somers Point that forced the closing of the Beesleys Point
Bridge, the 9th Street Bridge and two of the three access routes into Atlantic
City. Flooding was less severe during Tuesday night's high tide because the wind
had shifted, the National Weather Service said.
</P>
<P>
	   Wind gusts reached 43 mph at the Atlantic City Marina and at the Wildwood
Airport in Cape May County, and 57 mph in Waretown.
</P>
<P>
	   Eleven and a half inches of snow fell in Swedesboro, Gloucester County. At
the Atlantic City International Airport, the total was 8.2 inches. Cape May
registered 8.5 inches and Manasquan reported 7 inches.
</P>
<P>
	   In northern New Jersey, accumulations were between 5 and 11 inches.
</P>
<P>
	   The snow was expected to taper off after midnight and some flurries were
forecast for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The weather forced postponement of dozens of public events.
</P>
<P>
	   Among them: the swearing-in of a state Supreme Court justice in Trenton, a
"Disney on Ice" performance at Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford and
a court appearance by the Rev. Al Sharpton in Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
	   In South Orange, an on-campus memorial service for three Seton Hall
University students killed in a dormitory fire last week was postponed. It will
be held Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Newark International Airport remained open, but several airlines canceled
their entire flight schedule, according to Alan Hicks, a spokesman for the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey. Atlantic City International Airport was
closed.	   The road closings here spelled bad luck for already-snowbound casinos
that depend on tour bus traffic and drive-in customers.
</P>
<P>
	   The normally packed gambling halls were ghost towns. Whole rows of slot
machines sat idle, the usual din of bells and clinking quarters conspicuously
absent.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's nice, having it to ourselves. But I think when there's no people like
this, my chances aren't as good at hitting on the machines," said gambler Jean
Zaccarino, 74, of Pittsburgh, who was playing quarter slots with her husband,
Phil, at Trump Plaza Hotel &AMP; Casino.
</P>
<P>
	   She wasn't worried about the weather, though. "That's the (bus) driver's
problem," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Next door, at Caesars Atlantic City Hotel Casino, Caesars president Gary
DiBartolomeo surveyed his quiet casino with a worried look.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hopefully, we'll get it out of our system before the weekend. This is a big
weekend for us, with the Super Bowl and all," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gamblers weren't the only ones who couldn't get there. Casino workers by the
dozens stayed at home, prompting the casinos to close restaurants and cut back
on services.
</P>
<P>
	   With so many people home from work and school because of the snowstorm,
telephone usage was up Tuesday, jamming lines and occasionally making completing
a call difficult, said Bell Atlantic spokesman Eric Rabe.
</P>
<P>
	   "People get bored and they get on the Internet or they call their friends,"
Rabe said. Some callers were getting a fast busy signal or recorded message
saying "all circuits are busy."
</P>
<P>
	   The storm surprised weather forecasters and winter-weary New Jerseyans who
have endured a sudden stretch of cold and snow after another warmish winter.
</P>
<P>
	   "This storm just blew up," said state climatologist Dave Robinson. "It's a
large storm, and instead of tracking out to sea, it's come up the coast, and
dumped all of the snow into the Piedmont all the way up the coast."

<HEADLINE> No. 24 Temple 59, Xavier 40  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Mark Karcher scored 19 points as No. 24 Temple beat
Xavier 59-40 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Xavier (11-7, 2-4 Atlantic 10), coming off a 31-point home loss to La Salle,
has dropped four straight games for the second time in coach Skip Prosser's
seven seasons. The Musketeers, who beat No. 1 Cincinnati last month, shot 24
percent and hit only 7 of 27 3-point shots.
</P>
<P>
	   Pepe Sanchez, in his eighth game back from an ankle injury, had nine points,
eight assists, eight rebounds and three steals for Temple (13-4, 6-1), which won
its 17th straight home game.
</P>
<P>
	   Darnell Williams scored 15 points, and Lloyd Price had 14 for Xavier, which
hadn't lost four straight since its first year in the Atlantic 10 in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
	   Lamont Barnes and Quincy Wadley each scored 11 for the Owls.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanchez, the Owls' steady point guard, had two assists and four turnovers in
the first half but committed no turnovers in the second half. He shot 1-for-7
from the field. Temple, which shot 37 percent, has won three straight and seven
of eight.
</P>
<P>
	   The Owls went on a 22-4 run spanning the first and second halves, building
the lead to 36-22 on Wadley's 3-pointer with 16:36 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Lynn Greer's 3-pointer made it 46-30 with 9:11 left, but Xavier scored the
next eight points. Maurice McAfee hit a 3-pointer, Price a driving layup and
Kevin Frey a 3-pointer to cut it to 46-38 with 4:27 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Temple sealed it with a 9-0 run, getting a basket and 3-pointer from Wadley,
a driving jumper from Karcher and two free throws from Sanchez to make it 55-38
with 1:36 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 3,500 fans braved a snowstorm that battered the East Coast. Not counted
among them were Temple athletic department officials Scott Cathcart and Bob
Lange, who were pressed into duty at the scorer's table because only a skeleton
staff made it to the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Temple led 23-19 at halftime amid atrocious shooting by both teams. Xavier
was 7-for-33, and Temple 7-for-25. Only six players scored in the first half --
three for each team.
</P>
<P>
	   It was so bad that Xavier was 2-for-15 with nine turnovers in the first 8
1/2 minutes and yet only trailed 6-4. It appeared for a while that the teams
might challenge the A-10's record for fewest points in a game, 29 by Rutgers
against St. Bonaventure in 1982.

<HEADLINE> Storm Dumps Foot of Snow in East  </HEADLINE>
   By ROGER PETTERSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   A surprisingly fast-moving storm blanketed the East Coast with up to 2 feet
of wind-blown snow Tuesday, closing airports and schools, paralyzing the
nation's capital and leaving North Carolina looking more like North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The snow has completely covered my car. It's gone, I can't even see it,''
Thomas Allen said in Raleigh, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   A 5-year-old girl was missing and feared dead in Massachusetts after falling
into an icy river while walking to school in heavy snow.
</P>
<P>
	   At least three people were killed in weather-related traffic accidents
Monday or Tuesday in the Carolinas, and two people were found dead outside from
exposure in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm even intruded on the presidential campaign. Most of the candidates
flew to New Hampshire after the Iowa caucuses, but Republican Alan Keyes got
stuck in Detroit, unable to fly into Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm -- known as a nor'easter -- drove northward along the coast, with
moist air from the ocean colliding with cold air over the land. During the
morning, snow fell from South Carolina all the way to Maine.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm raced into the Northeast with a speed that surprised forecasters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We knew it was coming. It just decided to hit us a day earlier,'' said
National Weather Service meteorologist Tim Morrin in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm system was to press toward Maine by Wednesday morning, bringing
moderate to heavy snows from Pennsylvania through New England. The Southeast was
to get a break from the heavy precipitation.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday's storm the third snowfall in a week for some states, but for much
of the region it was the first major storm in a season that has seen little
snow. It was also the worst snowstorm to hit the area since the blizzard of
January 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Most federal agencies shut down in Washington, and were scheduled to be
closed again Wednesday. Legislative meetings were called off in Delaware, New
Hampshire and Pennsylvania, and Delaware Gov. Thomas Carper had to postpone his
State of the State address for the second time in a week because of snow.
</P>
<P>
	   Schools were closed from South Carolina to Maine, including nearly all
schools in New Jersey and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
	   Up to 17 inches of snow fell in parts of Virginia. The Baltimore-Washington
International Airport got more than 7 inches. Ten inches had accumulated outside
Philadelphia at King of Prussia, and New York City measured 6.
</P>
<P>
	   Snow up to 18 inches deep was forecast by the end of the storm in the
Berkshire hills of western Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm hit hardest in the Carolinas. North Carolina got a record 20.3
inches at the Raleigh-Durham airport.
</P>
<P>
	   The North Carolina utility CP&AMP;L had 81,000 customers without power, Duke
Power Co. reported 87,000 outages in North Carolina. More than 140,000 people
were without power in South Carolina and Virginia Power reported fewer than a
thousand customers in the dark.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With wind gusts at 40 miles per hour, it's just not safe to have somebody
up there working on a power line in a bucket truck,'' said CP&AMP;L spokeswoman
Sally Ramey.
</P>
<P>
	   North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt declared a state of emergency, activating the
National Guard to help clear streets and rescue stranded motorists. Stalled cars
and trucks shut down five miles of Interstate 85. Maryland Gov. Parris N.
Glendening also declared a state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There may be other snowstorms like this in Alaska or something, but never
in North Carolina,'' said Allen, the motorist whose car was buried in Raleigh,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm closed major Eastern airports, including New York's LaGuardia and
Washington Reagan National Airport, and others had delays and cancellations. US
Airways canceled all of its afternoon East Coast service between North Carolina
and New York.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think we didn't pick the best day for flying,'' Brazilian visitor Joao
Nemeth said at LaGuardia as he comforted an 11-year-old daughter who had
expected to fly to Walt Disney World.
</P>
<P>
	   A memorial service scheduled Tuesday in New Jersey at Seton Hall University
for three freshmen killed in a dormitory fire last week had to be rescheduled
because of the snow.
</P>
<P>
	   A few people appreciated the snow.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It adds beauty to this place,'' Rudolph Williams said in New York City.
``It adds life. It's creative. This here is a winter's work of art!''

   WACO, Texas (AP) -- Government lawyers on Tuesday formally denied that
federal law enforcement agents or the U.S. military shot at the Branch Davidian
compound at the end of the deadly April 1993 siege.
</P>
<P>
	   Their four-page federal court filing includes sworn statements by Defense
Department and U.S. Treasury Department lawyers, The Dallas Morning News
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Treasury lawyers wrote on behalf of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms that no one under the agency's supervision or control shot at the
sect's building on the last day of the 51-day standoff.
</P>
<P>
	   The Department of Defense, in a separate statement, said no one from the
military or under its control fired that day ``based on currently available
information.''
</P>
<P>
	   The response comes a week after lawyers for surviving Branch Davidians and
their families, who have filed a wrongful-death lawsuit, complained to a federal
judge in Waco about the government's refusal to answer that key question.
</P>
<P>
	   The deadly standoff began Feb. 28, 1993, when federal agents raided the
rural compound of Branch Davidian leader David Koresh and his followers. On
April 19, 1993, Koresh and more than 80 others died in an inferno, some from
fire, others from gunshots.
</P>
<P>
	   Government arson investigators have said the Davidians set the blaze.
Plaintiffs' lawyers have alleged that someone from the government fired
repeatedly into the building in the final hours of the assault.
</P>
<P>
	   In a federal court filing Jan. 18, lead plaintiffs' attorney Michael Caddell
complained of a ``clear gap'' between the broad scope of the plaintiffs'
question and the ``limited response'' the government's lawyers provided --
despite acknowledgment that the military's elite Delta Force was present during
the siege.
</P>
<P>
	   Caddell said he is pleased the government responded more specifically, but
said the issue remains in dispute. He noted that infrared FBI videotapes
recorded that day contain what some experts say are flashes of government
gunfire.

<HEADLINE> Mets Sign Ordonez to Four-Year Deal  </HEADLINE>
    By JOSH DUBOW AP Sports Writer

<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Mets avoided arbitration with Rey Ordonez,
signing their shortstop to a $19 million, four-year contract Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Ordonez, perhaps the top fielding shortstop in baseball, won his third
consecutive Gold Glove last season and is the anchor of the Mets' record-setting
infield with second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo and third baseman Robin Ventura.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mets made just 68 errors last season, 13 fewer than the previous low,
set by the 1998 Baltimore Orioles. New York's infield had 33 errors, 12 fewer
than the record set by the '64 Orioles.
</P>
<P>
	   "You build teams up the middle and certainly with Rey and Edgardo, we have
as strong a combination as arguably any in the game," Mets general manager Steve
Phillips said. "They have been an important part of our success and one we feel
is part of the formula for success. Therefore we wanted to secure that for as
long as we could."
</P>
<P>
	   Ordonez made just four errors last season, leading National League
shortstops with a .994 fielding percentage. He ended the season with 100
straight errorless games, breaking Cal Ripken's major league record for
shortstops.
</P>
<P>
	   Ordonez also had his best season at the plate, although he is still one of
the weaker offensive players in the league. He set career highs in batting
(.258), on-base percentage (.319), slugging percentage (.317), RBIs (60) and
doubles (24).
</P>
<P>
	   In four seasons with the Mets, the Cuban defector is hitting .246 with four
homers and 165 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
	   Ordonez, who was eligible for free agency after the 2001 season, got a $1
million signing bonus and will make $2 million this year, $3.75 million in 2001,
$6 million in 2002 and $6.25 million in 2003.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we hadn't gotten to a threshold we were comfortable with, we would have
waited to test the market," agent Adam Katz said. "We considered waiting, but
Steve and the Mets organization were forthcoming and very generous. We thought
the deal was equitable, so we agreed it was time to pull the trigger."
</P>
<P>
	   Ordonez, who made $1,675,000 in 1999, asked for $3.5 million, while the Mets
offered $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   "I found out what free agency was when I left Cuba," said Ordonez, who
defected in 1993 during the Pan American Games in Buffalo, N.Y. "I can't ask for
too much. I came with nothing and now I have everything I've ever dreamed of."
</P>
<P>
	   Even with the new contract, Ordonez's future in New York could still depend
on Seattle's Alex Rodriguez, who is eligible for free agency after next season.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mets have expressed interest in Rodriguez in the past and could trade
Ordonez if Rodriguez became available.
</P>
<P>
	   "They've been talking about that ever since I've been on the team and it's
never happened," Ordonez said. "I just hoped I can stay in New York."
