WATCHWORD OF RACES IS `TECHNOLOGY'

   NEW YORK _ Whether you take your scores fast or slow, the
scoreboard-watching season is upon us. Players and coaches no
longer attempt to mask their interest. The Red Sox want to know
what the Blue Jays and Rangers are doing. And they're not afraid to
admit they're watching.
</P>
<P>
   Every night is exciting now. The Cubs and Mets are shoulder to
shoulder for the National League wild card. Red Sox Nation is
nervous but took comfort in Tuesday night's slump-breaking 9-4 win
at Yankee Stadium. Meanwhile, the depleted Angels are struggling to
hold on, and the Indians are trying to win enough games to avoid
the Yankees in the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and then we've got Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire marching
toward history in a place where no ballplayers have gone. McGwire
launched No. 63 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, scoreboard-watching just isn't what it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, I sat in Earl Weaver's office and, at his request,
dialed the press box in Milwaukee (on a rotary phone, I might add)
to see how the Brewers were doing. It was late September, the
Orioles had a commanding lead in the American League East, and a
Milwaukee loss would clinch the division for Baltimore. My spy in
County Stadium delivered play-by-play and I relayed the information
to Earl until the Brewers finally lost and the race was officially
over.
</P>
<P>
   Fenway's hand-operated left-field scoreboard offers the same
old-timey process. For most of this century, Boston fans have held
their breath, waiting for the man behind the green wall to post a
big fat loss for the Yankees. Grounds crew pranksters have been
known to slide a bogus ``10'' into the Yankee slot, just to give
Red Sox Nation a little heartburn.
</P>
<P>
   But now the sweet science of scoreboard-watching has gone
high-tech. Fans with Internet access can track every pitch of any
game. ESPN seems to deliver scores faster than the speed of light.
Red Sox pitching coach Joe Kerrigan carries a hand-held gizmo that
gives him updated scores instantly. For those who need information,
there are no more phone calls to other stadiums, no more waiting
for the guy behind the wall to get out of his chair and update the
Yankee score. And the kids who answer the phone in the Globe sports
department are spared the dozens of calls we used to get from
barrooms late at night.
</P>
<P>
   Yankee Stadium's electronic scoreboard rises from the left-field
walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to turn around to see it from the bullpen,'' said Sox
reliever Jim Corsi.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard not to look up there,'' said Sox DH Mike Stanley.
``I like to look up to see what's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Bret Saberhagen added, ``I pay attention from day one. All the
time. And I come into the clubhouse, where we've got the TV on.''
</P>
<P>
   Guys watching TV knew that McGwire was not starting the first
game of a doubleheader against Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Yankees and Sox took the field, the Blue Jays already
held a 2-0 lead over the Indians. The prospect of the Sox'
wild-card lead shrinking to two games seemed real. A half-hour
later, the Indians led the Blue Jays, 3-2, and Jason Varitek
crashed a three-run homer (his first of two homers) to right to
give Boston a 3-0 lead in the second.
</P>
<P>
   When the Sox inflated their lead to 7-0 in the fourth, the
Indians went ahead of the Jays, 6-4. Just like that, it felt like
the Sox' lead had gone from two to four games. The Yankees were
trotting out a series of face-less pitchers (New York writers
believe it may have been a conspiracy _ the Yankees laying down to
punish the Blue Jays for brawling in New York last week), and the
Red Sox' magic number had a chance to drop to 9 with a lucky 13 to
play.
</P>
<P>
   And then it was learned that McGwire had hit No. 63, a pinch
homer in the ninth inning of Game 1 in St. Louis. The Yankee
Stadium crowd, like so many others in this feel-good baseball
summer, roared its approval when the news was flashed on the big
board.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Red Sox were leading, 9-0 (maybe Jimy Williams
was right, that getting shut out Monday was a good thing), while
the Blue Jays and Rangers were still losing.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the contrarian, Nomar Garciaparra said he didn't watch the
scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't pay attention,'' said the shortstop. ``I have no idea
what Toronto did tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   I was happy to deliver the news. The Sox were winners, the Jays
lost, the magic number was 9, McGwire had moved ahead of Sosa, the
world was a better place for scoreboard-watchers from Boston ...
and Nomar found out the old-fashioned way.

MAYOR WINS CHANCE TO TAKE HOUSE SEAT ONCE HELD BY JFK 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Also includes results from Rhode Island, Minnesota, Okla.)  
 (bl)  
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Michael Capuano, the mayor of the Boston suburb of
Somerville, fought off nine rivals to inherit one of the most
storied of political seats in the country Tuesday night, winning
the Democratic primary in the 8th Congressional District, which
sent a young John F. Kennedy to Washington more than half a century
ago.
</P>
<P>
   So entrenched are the liberal leanings of the 8th that Capuano
is considered a shoo-in to win the general election in November and
claim the seat of the second Kennedy to hold it, retiring Rep.
Joseph P. Kennedy II Capuano ran largely on skilled hometown
organization, effective television ads and a can-do record as mayor
that included reducing class size in Somerville schools to 19
pupils.
</P>
<P>
   In the Massachusetts race for governor, the acting Republican
governor, Argeo Paul Cellucci, solidly defeated state Treasurer
Joseph Malone for the party's nomination. He will face Tuesday's
winner of the Democratic primary, state Attorney General Scott
Harshbarger, in a contest that political pollsters consider a
toss-up.
</P>
<P>
   In Rhode Island, which also held its primary Tuesday, the stage
is set for a similarly hard-fought governor's race. Lincoln Almond,
the Republican incumbent, who was unopposed, will face a rematch
against former state Sen. Myrth York, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   In the 8th District of Massachusetts, which includes parts of
Boston and several suburbs, early estimates held that only about
75,000 people voted, meaning that with the crowded field of 10
candidates, all it took was a few thousand votes to win _ and
Capuano's Somerville contained 15 percent of the Democratic voters
in the district.
</P>
<P>
   The appetite to vote was blunted by the strong economy combined
with less-than-compelling state-wide races and perhaps a tinge of
added political alienation brought on by the scandal in Washington,
analysts said. Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin
predicted that of the state's 3.3 million registered voters, only
about 1 million would come to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Voting in the 8th District was hampered as well by widespread
confusion among constituents trying to keep the cornucopia of
candidates straight.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Nicolora, a grandmother of 15, who was interviewed after
she voted in North Cambridge, said she had voted for Chris
Gabrieli, a venture capitalist, because ``I liked him from the
start.'' And yet, she said, ``I bounced back and forth between
different ones. I liked the mayor of Somerville.''
</P>
<P>
   It would have been easier, she said, if Kennedy had stayed in
the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hard seat to fill after Joe,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, the eldest son of Robert F. Kennedy, announced that he
was retiring, for now, from politics to devote himself more to
family and business following the New Year's Eve skiing death of
his brother, Michael.
</P>
<P>
   Capuano's victory was snatched from the hands of Raymond Flynn,
the former mayor of Boston and U.S. ambassador to the Vatican, who
had become the early front-runner in the race. He suffered from a
constricted campaign budget and the problem that, though his name
recognition was high, opinions about him among voters were deeply
mixed between a core of strong support and a core of strong
antipathy caused in part by his anti-abortion stance.
</P>
<P>
   Polls had also put former state Sen. George Bachrach and former
talk-show host Marjorie Clapprood among the front-runners in a race
that has proved the most expensive congressional contest in
Massachusetts history.
</P>
<P>
   Capuano appeared to have been bolstered in part by relatively
strong turnout in his hometown of Somerville, a densely populated,
well-worn old city of triple-decker houses and confusingly
irregular grids of streets known to confound even the
well-oriented.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, despite the lofty history of the 8th _ which was the
political home of President Kennedy; the longtime House Speaker
Thomas O'Neill; and Boston's ``Rascal King Mayor,'' James Michael
Curley _ the race appeared to devolve down to the most retail of
retail politics. A poll commissioned by The Boston Herald found
that among voters who supported Capuano, a full 44 percent had met
him.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, The Herald noted, 44 percent of respondents said they
had met or seen one of the candidates, compared with the 10 percent
or so of voters who generally meet one of the presidential
candidates in New Hampshire, the capital of retail politics.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nicolora attested to the power of such contact, though for a
different candidate. She voted for Gabrieli in part because she
liked his plan for schools, she said, but also, she added, because
she had met his mother at a picnic.
</P>
<P>
   Primaries were also held Tuesday in Minnesota, North Carolina,
Oklahoma and Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, state Attorney General Hubert H. Humphrey III beat
two other political scions to win the Democratic-Farmer-Labor
Party's nomination for governor. Humphrey, the son of the former
vice president and senator, defeated Mike Freeman, son of former
Gov. Orville Freeman, and Ted Mondale, son of former Vice President
Walter Mondale.
</P>
<P>
   In November Humphrey will face a former Democrat, St. Paul Mayor
Norm Coleman, who easily won the Republican primary. Gov. Arne
Carlson, a Republican, is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   In Oklahoma, Don Carroll defeated a dead opponent, Jacquelyn
Ledgerwood, for the Democratic nomination for the Senate. On Nov.
3, he will face Sen. Don Nickles, a Republican, who was unopposed.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Ms. Ledgerwood died of a heart attack soon after
filing her candidacy, she finished second in an Aug. 25 primary,
requiring a runoff.

BRADY BOUNCES BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The beating redshirt freshman Marcus Brady
absorbed in the season-opening loss to Boise State is now legendary
at Cal State Northridge, though five sacks and numerous knockdowns
only tell a small portion of it.
</P>
<P>
   But what Matadors coach Ron Ponciano wanted to see was what
transpired after that, when Brady stepped back onto the practice
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only effect you saw was the sutures in his chin, but
outside the Band-Aids, he shows no aftereffects at all,'' Ponciano
said Tuesday. ``I didn't know what to expect from him, but now I
know we have a guy who was put in the worst situation possible and
he responded great.''
</P>
<P>
   As CSUN prepares for its Big Sky opener Saturday at No. 13
Northern Arizona, Brady sees a week off and an altering of the
offensive line much to his liking.
</P>
<P>
   David San Vicente and Keith Kincaid remain at the tackle spots
and Mike Shoffeitt will play right guard. But the changes will have
Arizona State transfer Mike Barnes at left guard and junior Julio
Alcala at center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more relaxed now and I'm able to read defenses and pick up
schemes better,'' said Brady, who completed 25 of 46 for 289 yards
in his debut. ``Overall, I'm not thinking too much. I think part of
the problem was we didn't have much film of Boise State.''
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Fallen Matador: &UR; !off! &LR;  Ponciano spent part of Monday
visiting former CSUN linebacker Marc Goodson.
</P>
<P>
   Goodson, who set a single-season CSUN record with 140 tackles in
1997, was beaten when he stopped to help two females near Lindley
Avenue close to the CSUN campus early Saturday morning, LAPD
spokesman Jason Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He feels like (garbage) and he's going to have surgery
Thursday because the side of his face is caved in,'' Ponciano said.
``It's a terrible situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodson told police he saw two females being harrassed by two
males. When he pulled his car over and told the people to leave the
girls alone he was struck from behind with an unknown object and
lost consciousness, and when he awoke everyone was gone, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   The police report said Goodson, who was treated at County/USC
Medical Center and released, suffered fractures to his left cheek
and eye socket, a two-inch cut to his left cheek, a two-inch cut to
the back of his head and a bruised eye.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Injury front &UR; !off! &LR;  An MRI done on center Beau Cherry's
left knee revealed less damage than expected, and as a result he
might miss only four weeks instead of six to eight. Cherry said
he's targeting the Oct. 17 game at Cal State Sacramento for his
return.
</P>
<P>
   However, defensive tackle Erik Gardner's prognosis wasn't as
favorable. Originally projected to miss three to four weeks with a
right knee sprain, Gardner is now expected to miss six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A physical practice Tuesday also left starting free safety
Jeremy Golden with a left-shoulder bruise, but he said he should be
fine by Thursday. Also, defensive lineman Sean Beard injured his
left elbow but should play against NAU. But it's unlikely backup
center Joe Bergman will play against NAU because of an ankle
injury. &UR; !dlim!!end! &LR;  &QL;

EDITORIAL: A CLINTON PLEA BARGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Sept. 16:
</P>
<P>
   The president cannot avoid impeachment hearings if his lawyers
continue to insult the public by insisting that he did not lie
under oath. That is the message that Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and
Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., delivered Monday by denouncing the legal
hairsplitting by White House lawyers. They were also serving notice
that if impeachment hearings do come, the president's own party
will not defend him under the deservedly ridiculed strategy devised
by David Kendall.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton responded to this sobering warning from two
indispensable congressional defenders with a half-measure. He has
shoved Kendall away from the cameras and assigned a new
flak-catcher, Gregory Craig, to work Capitol Hill. But this
tactical dancing will not stop the accelerating movement toward
impeachment nor encourage congressional sentiment for a negotiated
censure resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The president's defense team has been dwarfed by the magnitude
of its task. He needs the help of a larger, wiser figure than he
now employs, a Democrat of stature who commands respect on Capitol
Hill and can try to arrange a plea bargain while there is still
time.
</P>
<P>
   This page has persistently criticized Clinton's conduct and
abuse of the truth, and we are prepared to see the impeachment
process through to a resolution if he remains unwilling to concede
that he lied under oath. But we also see that the national interest
could be served by a settlement that allows Clinton to stay in
office with a heavy congressional reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   As in most grand compromises, the outlines of such a deal are
obvious. Clinton would have to confess to what everyone already
knows _ that he perjured himself before a federal grand jury and in
a civil proceeding _ as a way of affirming that no citizen,
including the president, is above the law. What he would need in
return would be a promise of censure instead of removal, an end to
that part of the independent counsel inquiry focused on his
offenses, and a guarantee of no criminal indictment.
</P>
<P>
   As with any grand compromise, there are equally obvious
problems. The admission of lying would open him to a renewed civil
suit by Paula Jones. That can be settled with money, as it should
have been last year. Any limiting of the Starr investigation would
have to be approved by the panel of federal judges that supervises
the independent counsel. On some aspects of the case, Congress
might have to immunize Clinton or agree to have him pardon himself.
</P>
<P>
   Another question is who in the Democratic Party has the gravitas
to conduct such negotiations. Former Sen. George Mitchell
understandably refused to join the current half-baked effort. But
he would be a good choice if Clinton vests someone with the
authority to bargain seriously on his behalf, rather than play
legalistic games. Others who come to mind are former Sen. Sam Nunn,
former Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Lloyd Cutler, the
former White House counsel, and Leon Panetta, the former White
House chief of staff. Among Democrats in Congress, Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn., has earned the standing to open serious
discussions with Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, R-Miss., Tuesday
disparaged any deal, but a smarter advocate than the president now
employs might persuade Republicans that the public desires a
settlement. The fact that two-thirds of the people want censure and
only one-third favor impeachment could sway the GOP toward a deal
in which Clinton acknowledges his failure to faithfully execute the
law.
</P>
<P>
   What is beyond question is that unless the White House
dispatches a heavyweight political deal-maker, the Republican
leadership will let the process grind through the fall. Time is
this president's enemy in another way, too. A little-noticed
paragraph of the Starr report raises the possibility of sending
Congress information on other matters. Are Clinton's lawyers so
detached from reality that they think their politically wobbly
client can take a major disclosure that his associates violated the
law on Whitewater, Filegate or Travelgate?
</P>
<P>
   So far, the entire Clinton defense effort can be summed up as
too little too late. Having tried delay, lying and lawyers who
energize foes and alienate friends, Clinton might try sending a
political professional to strike a realistic deal that would allow
him to hang onto his office.

largest sit-down dinner ever, requiring a banquet hall also known
as the Astrodome. But not even the local brand of relentless
hospitality can make up for oil prices that nobody here wants to

HUBERT HUMPHREY III WINS DFL NOMINATION FOR MINNESOTA GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Hubert H. Humphrey III, who bears Minnesota's most
revered name, easily won the Democratic Farmer-Labor Party
nomination for governor of Minnesota on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey _ the son and namesake of the late vice president,
senator and 1968 presidential nominee _ has been the state's
attorney general for the last 16 years. He will face the Republican
nominee, St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman, who switched parties two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a race stocked with famous Minnesota names, Humphrey, known
throughout the state as Skip, touted his role in bringing a public
health lawsuit against tobacco companies that ended in a $6.1
billion settlement for the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic also-rans included offspring of some of the most
famous names in the state's political, civic and business orbits:
Ted Mondale, the son of former Vice President Walter Mondale; Mike
Freeman, the son of former Gov. Orville Freeman, and Mark Dayton,
an heir to the Dayton Hudson department store conglomerate, which
owns the Target chain. A fifth candidate, state Sen. Doug Johnson,
campaigned as the only candidate who came from a common worker's
background.
</P>
<P>
   A third-party candidate, Jesse Ventura, a former professional
wrestler who had been a mayor of a Minneapolis suburb, is running
on the Reform Party label.
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey, 56, shares his father's generally populist stance, but
is not as enthusiastic or impassioned an orator as the elder
Humphrey, who was called the Happy Warrior.
</P>
<P>
   Besides lauding his victory over the tobacco giants, Humphrey
campaigned for higher spending on education, including subsidies
that would pay for the first two years of tuition at any state
public or private college.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, 49, wasted no time in kicking off campaign broadsides
against his Democratic opponent, saying that Humphrey represented
``the old vision of tax-and-spend'' liberals. Coleman said that he
would be tough with street gangs and cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Brooklyn, N.Y., native who was one of eight
children, Coleman sought to portray himself as the candidate with a
feel for common people. In a statement obviously meant to bring
comparisons with Humphrey, the Republican boasted that he had
``never had a silver spoon in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary saw a turnout of about 20 percent, considered quite
low with a field of big-name candidates. Dayton was the biggest
spender in the race, using his own money in a $1.8 million
campaign. Freeman won the party's endorsement.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Primaries were also held Tuesday in North Carolina, Oklahoma and
Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   In Oklahoma, Don Carroll defeated a dead opponent, Jacquelyn
Ledgerwood, for the Democratic nomination for the Senate. On Nov.
3, he will face Sen. Don Nickles, a Republican, who was unopposed.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, Humphrey's famous name and his record as attorney
general had cast him as the heavy favorite in the race.
</P>
<P>
   A traditionally liberal state, Minnesota has been the most
reliably Democratic state in presidential elections for a
generation. Unusual in a state that is 95 percent white, Democrats
control both houses in the state legislature.
</P>
<P>
   But the state's population is changing in ways that could help
Republicans, growing fastest in the outer-ring suburbs where people
are more likely to hold conservative political values.

RANGERS RALLY PAST ORIOLES, 6-5
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The Rangers' bid for an American League West
championship begged for one player to step forth and breathe life
into a season wilting before their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Ivan Rodriguez became that player on a steamy, September
evening last night inside the confines of what first appeared to be
a two-day tomb known as Oriole Park at Camden Yards.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's two-run, ninth-inning home run with Orioles closer
Armando Benitez on the mound resuscitated the Rangers from apparent
defeat to what will likely be recognized as their most important
triumph this season.
</P>
<P>
   The improbable, 6-5 victory catapulted the Rangers within one
game of the AL West-leading Anaheim Angels, who lost to the
expansion Devil Rays, 8-1, last night at Tampa Bay's Tropicana
Field.
</P>
<P>
   Those events set the stage for a two-game series scheduled
between the AL West contenders tonight and tomorrow at The Ballpark
in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez will be portrayed as the hero that saved the Rangers
from this disappointing, five-game excursion away from The Ballpark
in Arlington, but several players rose to the occasion on what
appeared to be a lost cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why you can't quit,'' Rangers second baseman Mark
McLemore said. ``We didn't just win tonight. We came back after
being five runs down and won it in the ninth. This is a big lift
for us. I don't care what it does to Anaheim. They're not the one
we're worried about.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who entered his final at-bat 0-for-7 with four
strikeouts and two double-play ground balls during the series,
deposited Benitez's 1-2 pitch into the left-field seats for a
380-foot home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only pitch,'' Rodriguez said of the 86-mph slider,
``that I saw the past two days.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, though, also saw the Rangers snatch victory from
defeat after the Orioles took a 5-0 lead during the third inning. A
two-out, two-run homer by third baseman Cal Ripken in the third
completed the evening for Rangers right-hander Esteban Loaiza, who
started the game with one day of rest.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the first of several Rangers heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Eric Gunderson pitched 2 1/3 scoreless innings, and
the Rangers finally responded offensively after Orioles
right-hander Chris Fussell kept the Rangers scoreless through five
innings in his major-league debut.
</P>
<P>
   A walk to Tom Goodwin and consecutive hits by McLemore, Rusty
Greer, Juan Gonzalez and designated hitter Will Clark resulted in
two runs, and Gonzalez scored the third on a double-play ground
ball.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers right-handers Danny Patterson and Tim Crabtree and
left-hander Tony Fossas provided another three scoreless innings,
and that gave the Rangers an opportunity during their final at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who fractured the big toe on his right foot Saturday and
missed the previous two games, led off the ninth inning with the
second of two improbable infield hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a broken toe, and he's out there hobbling down the
first-base line,'' Patterson said. ``That might be the fastest I've
seen him run in two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark legged it out, and the magical conclusion began.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander John Wetteland pitched a scoreless ninth inning for
the save and joined Dennis Eckersley, Jeff Reardon and Lee Smith as
the only relievers with three or more 40-save seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pudgie won it, but this was a team effort in order to come
back from five runs down,'' Clark said. ``Now, we go back home and
get ready to play Anaheim. We determine our fate now.''

BONILLA'S VITAL SIGNS IMPROVING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Last December, doctors told Bobby Bonilla he
would need a year to completely recover from surgery to both his
left wrist and left Achilles' tendon.
</P>
<P>
   It has been frustrating for Bonilla and the Los Angeles Dodgers,
since they expected him to produce right away after he was acquired
May 15 from the Florida Marlins. He hit a home run in his first
game with the club but didn't hit another until Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   After four months, Bonilla's bat finally has come alive.
</P>
<P>
   He has hit safely in seven of eight games (9 for 25, .360).
Monday night, he went 3 for 3 and he has reached base 15 times in
31 plate appearances. Tuesday, he walked during the Dodgers'
two-run first-inning rally, then singled home Eric Karros in the
fifth to tie the game. During that stretch, Bonilla was 4 for 5
with runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just getting healthier, that's all,'' Bonilla said. ``I'm
still not where I should be or where I'm going to be. But all the
signs are pointing in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``This winter will be nothing but lifting weights, getting my
strength back. I'm already looking forward to Vero Beach (Dodgers'
spring-training camp in Florida).''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen, however, what the Dodgers' plans are for
Bonilla. He has been adequate defensively at third. But they
promoted top prospect Adrian Beltre two months ago from Double-A
and view him as the future. Bonilla played poorly in left field,
but much of that had to do with the Achilles' injury that limited
his mobility.
</P>
<P>
   New general manager Kevin Malone has said his biggest obstacle
to rebuilding the Dodgers is overcoming the $53 million committed
to 12 players for next year. Bonilla, 35, will earn $5.9 million
next season and $5.9 million in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla and Malone have a good relationship, dating back to
their years together in Baltimore. Malone was the assistant GM;
Bonilla was one of the Orioles' better players.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Malone and GM Pat Gillick attempted to unload Bonilla
and left-hander David Wells but were overruled by owner Peter
Angelos. The Orioles rallied to qualify for the American League
playoffs as a wild-card team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin and I have always gotten along very well,'' Bonilla
said. ``Whatever happens this winter, those things are out of my
control. But I know he will be honest with me. That is his
strength. He was an excellent choice.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Medical update: Bonilla will remain in Los Angeles for two
weeks after the end of the season to formulate a workout schedule.
He lives in Connecticut during the offseason.... Gary Sheffield
will have an MRI on his sprained left ankle today. He was examined
Tuesday, but doctors want another look. They do not expect to find
further damage, but Sheffield has not had an MRI since injuring his
ankle.... Darren Dreifort, who skipped a start due to a sore right
shoulder, will throw today on flat ground. He is not expected to
pitch again this season.... Mark Guthrie, out two weeks with a
sprained ligament in his left elbow, threw in the bullpen before
the game and should be available for this weekend's Giants series
in San Francisco.

 GRIFFEY REACHES 1.000 CAREER RBIs  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Consider the select company Ken Griffey Jr. joined
Tuesday at the Metrodome, becoming the fourth-youngest player in
major league history to drive in 1,000 runs, and then weigh the
what-if factor.
</P>
<P>
   What if Griffey hadn't broken a finger on his right hand as a
rookie in 1989?
</P>
<P>
   What if he hadn't shattered his left wrist six years later?
</P>
<P>
   What if he hadn't broken a hamate bone the next season?
</P>
<P>
   What if the players hadn't gone on strike the season after that
and part of the next one?
</P>
<P>
   In short, what if Griffey hadn't missed more than 200 games in
what looks more and more like a Hall of Fame career?
</P>
<P>
   Derailed by injuries and the work stoppage, but driven by a
win-at-all-costs approach, the Mariner center fielder reached a
grand milestone Tuesday afternoon. He began pursuit of his next
1,000 RBIs with a two-run single in the fourth inning and three-run
homer in the seventh, powering Seattle to a 12-7 victory over the
Minnesota Twins in front of 8,024 fans whose numbers appeared to be
less than half that much.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, who turns 29 in November, flipped the page to another
career chapter in the fourth inning when he lined a bases-loaded
single to center field off loser Frank Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as the ball bounced,'' Griffey said, ``I was calling
timeout so I could get it. Guys were still running and I'm yelling,
`Time'.''
</P>
<P>
   Shane Monahan became Griffey's 1,000th RBI. Carlos Guillen was
No. 1,001.
</P>
<P>
   The march to 1,000 began on April 10, 1989 at the Kingdome, when
he drove in himself. In his first major league at-bat in Seattle,
Griffey hit a first-pitch home run to left field off Chicago White
Sox right-hander Eric King. The rest is unfolding history.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only one word I can use to describe him _
spectacular,'' first-year Mariner batting coach Jesse Barfield
said. ``To do what he has done and still be only 28 years old ...''
</P>
<P>
   The only players to drive in that many runs at a younger age are
in the Hall of Fame: Mel Ott, Jimmy Foxx and Lou Gehrig. Griffey
has one foot in the Cooperstown door.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in front of his locker, Griffey was asked about the
significance of reaching the 1,000 RBI mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means I have driven in 600-and-some people before me,''
quipped Griffey, who has 346 career home runs. ``I've been
fortunate to drive in runs, but the most important thing is we got
the `W'. We might not make it to the postseason, but we can finish
up strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners haven't been officially eliminated from the
American League West race, but there is no way they can repeat as
division champions. Texas and Anaheim face each other five more
times, and the Angels already have 81 wins, two more than the
Rangers. Seattle cannot win more than 82.
</P>
<P>
   So personal accomplishments and looking ahead are all that
remain for the Mariners. Griffey still has 12 games to pad his
offensive stats. Going into Wednesday night's game in Oakland, he
has 52 home runs, 132 RBIs and a .289 batting average.
</P>
<P>
   He would like to finish the season batting at least .300 for the
eighth time in his 10 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Junior ever sets his mind to winning a batting title, he
could do it and still hit 70 home runs and lead the league in
RBIs,'' Barfield said.
</P>
<P>
   What he did was go 4-for-6, drive in five runs and steal a base.
He is within one theft of becoming the third player in big-league
history to hit at least 50 home runs and steal 20 bases in the same
season. Only Willie Mays (1955) and Brady Anderson ('96) have
accomplished the feat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really care about milestones,'' he said. ``The
enjoyment I have is doing the little things to help us win and
having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of his joy is a pitcher's agony. Just ask Eddie Guardardo.
The Minnesota reliever thought he had Griffey struck out on a
2-and-2 pitch in the seventh inning. But the borderline pitch was
called a ball by plate umpire Dale Scott, and Griffey hit the next
pitch barely over the blue baggie in right field.
</P>
<P>
   As Griffey clicked into his home-run trot, Guardado cursed Scott
and was ejected. Twins manager Tom Kelly, who had to be restrained
several times, also got the heave-ho.
</P>
<P>
   Was it a ball or strike?
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think?'' Griffey said. ``I had to come in (to look
at the pitch on the clubhouse TV) to see for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: Shortstop Alex Rodriguez went 3-for-5 and scored three
runs but didn't hit his 40th home run. He has now gone six games
without the HR he needs to become the third player in major league
history to hit 40 homers and steal 40 bases in the same season. ...
Paul Abbott, who started his pro career as a Twin but was cut loose
because of injuries, returned to Minneapolis to win his second
consecutive start for the M's since being recalled from Class AAA
Tacoma. This one came on his 31st birthday. ... The game was marred
by a collision at first base between Mariner Raul Ibanez and umpire
Dave Phillips. The ump sustained a bloody nose and cuts on his face
after hitting the turf, face-down. Ibanez wasn't seriously hurt,
but both left the game. ... ``We hit the ball well the past two
days,'' said M's manager Lou Piniella. ``A lot of
first-and-thirding, a lot of running, some bunting. We put 12 runs
on the board and had only one home run. That's unusual for us and
it's good to see. We are putting the game in motion a lot more.''

SPORTS MARKET HAS NO CEILING TO BOTTOM LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Lost in the hoo-hah over Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa,
as well as the start of the pro and college football seasons, was a
noteworthy financial development that said much about the state of
pro sports, and specifically the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion franchise going into Cleveland in 1999 went to the
high bidder for $530 million.
</P>
<P>
   Remember a couple of years ago when some people around here
thought Paul Allen was a fool for paying $200 million to Ken
Behring for the Seahawks franchise?
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawk purchase ``was a steal,'' Leigh Steinberg said.
``I'm predicting that in a few years an NFL franchise will go for
$1 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this was the guy who chose to represent former
Seahawk quarterback Dan McGwire, not his brother.
</P>
<P>
   One would think that ``Jerry Maguire'' would know from his
McGwires. But hey, even the best strike out occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   The movie character played by Tom Cruise in the hit film was
based largely on the legendary career of Steinberg, who served as
the film's technical advisor. As one might imagine for one who is
the subject of a movie, life has been good.
</P>
<P>
   For one, he's already representing a higher pedigree of Seahawk
quarterback in Warren Moon, not to mention four of his teammates.
For another, he's now an author. He was in town Tuesday to pump
``Winning With Integrity,'' a new tome about how to negotiate
effectively without being a complete sellout.
</P>
<P>
   His 23 years in the agent business have run parallel with the
stupendous rise in the American pro sports economy, including
player salaries, franchise values, ticket prices and stadium costs.
</P>
<P>
   With each record-breaking player contract, franchise sale or
stadium investment, many outside the business forecast a day of
reckoning for sports. But that's been said now for about 20 years,
since free agency became common in major league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible, but I don't know when it's going to be,''
Steinberg said, recalling that gasps were prominent when the NFL
expansion franchises in Carolina and Jacksonville went for $130
million. Five years later, the expansion fee was quadrupled by
bidders for the Browns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it end? I don't see where, unless people quit watching
sports,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the market is far more fractionalized with so many
channel options, television moguls and cyberspace tycoons are
convinced there is a virtually endless audience if you just trick
things up sufficiently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Broadcast and the Internet represent an enormous delivery
system that need programming,'' he said. ``ESPN has clearly
established that most American men would rather watch mediocre
sports than any other kind of programming.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.2l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Even more than the spread of ESPN on its multiple channels,
on-line service and bi-weekly magazine, it's Fox that provides the
statement for sports as an empire-maker.
</P>
<P>
   Fox came from nowhere to become the No. 4 U.S. network with
three of the top 15-rated shows largely on the strength of its
investment in the NFL four years ago and its showcase for
promotion, Steinberg said.

   Fox overpaid for its rights to NFC games and blew CBS out of pro
football. Although Fox never recouped its rights fees in ad
dollars, its incessant promotion of other shows during game
broadcasts floated the entire network. Fox is so persuaded about
the value of sports programming that it bought perhaps the premier
franchise in baseball, the Dodgers, and are attempting to buy the
premier franchise in soccer, England's Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL was a loss leader,'' he said. ``CBS learned that
lesson and got back into the NFL this season. NBC didn't, but
they'll be back in the next go-round.''
</P>
<P>
   The frenzy for sports not only has bid up the rights to
conventional sports, it has prompted the invention of fresh sports
for niche markets, such as ESPN's X Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mix of sports, entertainment and broadcast options,'' he
said, ``puts us in as revolutionary a period for our industry as
the computer industry was 15 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home this summer, Steinberg had a bit of a
revolutionary experience with a client _ determining the market for
a 41-year-old quarterback who was still near the top of his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no model, no analogy,'' he said of the negotiations
on behalf of Moon, whom he described in his book's acknowledgments
as ``my guiding light and dear friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon was a rare Steinberg client who was held out of camp
despite a valid contract. Moon wanted a deal closer to the average
of NFL starting quarterbacks, around $5 million a year, but finally
blinked when the Seahawks went about halfway there, still a big
upgrade from his scheduled stipend.
</P>
<P>
   If mulligans were granted in his line of work, Steinberg
suspects he and the Seahawks would ask for a do-over regarding
Moon. He described his stare-down with Seahawk bosses as a product
of ``new people and miscommunications.''
</P>
<P>
   But the deal was done. He didn't get Moon enough money to buy an
NFL club, but someday he'll be able to buy the Tacoma Tideflats
franchise in the NFL Auxiliary League on ESPN XII.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a striking break with the established political
order, Anthony Williams, a government technocrat who moved to
Washington less than three years ago to help lift the city out of
its fiscal mess, won the Democratic nomination for mayor Tuesday
over three opponents who are longtime City Council members.
</P>
<P>
   The victory by Williams, former chief financial officer for the
city, gave him the inside track to election as mayor in November
because of the Democrats' 10-to-1 enrollment advantage over
Republicans and because he is a black candidate in a predominantly
black city. If elected, he will succeed Mayor Marion Barry, the man
who dominated politics in this city for a generation.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republican candidate, Carol Schwartz, who is white, said
Tuesday that she should not be underestimated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may be overwhelmed by the numbers, but there is an
overwhelming response to me in the community,'' she insisted.
</P>
<P>
   In the early tally in the Democratic primary Tuesday night,
Williams had 54 percent of the votes. He easily outdistanced the
three City Council members who opposed him: Kevin Chavous, who had
31 percent; Jack Evans, with 10 percent, and Harold Brazil, with 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Because an outsider was nominated by the Democrats, the primary
could be read as a repudiation of the current city government,
which has been largely subordinated by a control board imposed by
Congress in response to a combination of out-of-control spending
and failure to collect all taxes owed that led to hundreds of
millions of dollars in deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Barry did not seek re-election after having won four of the
first five elections under the limited home rule that the city had
been given by Congress. The only time he did not win was after he
was sentenced to a six-month jail term for possession of cocaine
that interrupted his third term.
</P>
<P>
   His administration was marked by turmoil. Until recent
improvements imposed by the control board started to take root,
many residents held Barry and the City Council responsible for the
failing schools, budget deficits and a decline in city services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony Williams' victory will mean that the District of Columbia
will have a real new beginning in terms of leadership,'' said Prof.
Charles Harris, a political scientist at Howard University who
specializes in the relationship between Congress and the city
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``His success will depend on how well he can build a consensus
among his constituencies and win support from Congress,'' Harris
said, adding what is often left unsaid by political candidates,
``There is a racial divide in this city.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry, his one-term replacement, Sharon Pratt Kelly, and
Williams are black, and the 1990 census said the black population
was 66 percent, with recent estimates putting it at closer to 60
percent, still the majority.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schwartz, then, is in two minorities: whites and
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican candidate, who was unopposed in her party's
primary, said in an interview Tuesday: ``I am not a partisan
person. I am not a racial person. They forgive me those perceived
handicaps.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schwartz, 54, a former special education teacher and a
resident of Washington for the past 32 years, warned against
writing her off. She received 33 percent of the vote in her first
campaign for mayor against Barry in 1986 and increased that to 42
percent against the mayor in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to get far more than that this time,'' Ms. Schwartz
said. ``I've won citywide office in this town twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schwartz's reference was to her elections as an at-large
member of the City Council. In both her mayoral races, her vote was
far greater than the 7 percent enrollment of Republicans in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, the outsider, could turn Ms. Schwartz's City Council
experience against her, as he did in campaigning against the City
Council members he defeated in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   He has held public office only once, as a member of the Board of
Aldermen in New Haven in the early 1980s, and has spent the rest of
his career in government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 46, has been chief financial officer for the
Department of Agriculture, deputy state comptroller of Connecticut,
executive director of the Community Development Agency in St. Louis
and assistant director of the Boston Redevelopment Authority.
</P>
<P>
   He came to Washington in 1995 as chief financial officer and has
taken credit for eliminating the city's budget deficit and bringing
it to a surplus of $185 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Williams grew up in Los Angeles and then set upon his
peripatetic career. He has an undergraduate political science
degree from Yale University, a law degree from Harvard University
and a master's degree in public policy from Harvard's Kennedy
School of Government.
</P>
<P>
   Only rarely mentioning Barry's name, the candidates all harkened
to the need to turn things around.
</P>
<P>
   At a candidates' forum last week, one of Tuesday's losers,
Brazil said that, as mayor: ``I will work with Congress. I will
work with the Control Board. I will insist on accountability. I
will make Washington work again.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans said: ``Philadelphia, Cleveland and New York all went
through control boards. They turned things around. What did they do
to accomplish that? They elected a good mayor. Having a new mayor
in the District of Columbia will leap us ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The third Council member seeking the nomination, Chavous, did
not attend the forum. He said in a campaign statement, ``This
election gives us an opportunity to reform our government and
restore our democratic rights.''
</P>
<P>
   A noncandidate at the mayoral forum, Wilbert Washington 2d, gave
this summation of the election, ``This is the first time that we
will have an election in the post-Barry era.''
</P>
<P>
   Primaries were also held Tuesday in Maryland, Massachusetts,
Rhode Island, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Washington
state.
</P>
<P>
   In the Massachusetts governor's race, Acting Gov. Argeo Paul
Cellucci defeated state Treasurer Joseph Malone by almost 2-to-1
for the Republican Party's nomination. He will face Tuesday's
winner of the Democratic primary, state Attorney General Scott
Harshbarger, in a contest that political experts consider a
toss-up.

VARITEK HELPS RED SOX CLOBBER YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-YANKEES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Whenever he catches knuckleballer Tim Wakefield, Red
Sox rookie Jason Varitek wears an oversized glove and hopes for the
best.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting? By necessity, that's an afterthought for a kid catcher
praying he doesn't embarrass himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' said catching instructor Grady Little as Varitek
nodded in agreement. ``When you catch Wakefield, you're operating
on one principle and one principle only: `Drive in more runs than
you let in.'''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the Red Sox haven't been scoring runs regardless
of who is on the mound, Varitek more than lived up to the catcher's
credo Tuesday night, hitting two home runs and driving in five runs
in Boston's 9-4 win over the Yankees. He hit a three-run homer in
the second, producing as many runs as the Sox had scored in their
previous 30 innings, and hit a two-run homer off the facing of the
third deck to make it 7-0 in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The win ended the Sox' three-game slide and was just their third
in 12 games. With Toronto losing, 7-5, in Cleveland, Boston
extended its lead in the wild-card race to four games with 13 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fighting for something, so this one really felt good,
you're doggone right,'' said manager Jimy Williams. ``We've been
playing hard, but the end result hasn't been there. We finally got
one.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the magic number for the Red Sox to clinch a
playoff spot is in single digits _ 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a lot of love from my teammates today, both offensively
and defensively,'' said Wakefield, who had been lit up for 20 runs
in 14 innings in his last three starts, all losses, but matched his
career high in wins Tuesday night with No. 16, shutting out the
Yankees until Scott Brosius's three-run homer in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those runs made it a lot easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the win came at the expense of a rookie, Mike Jerzembeck, a
New York neighborhood kid (Queens) making his first big league
start because Yankees manager Joe Torre is setting up his rotation
for the playoffs. Under normal circumstances, the Sox would have
been facing tough lefty Andy Pettitte, but his next start was
pushed back until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't talk about the kid because I wanted to be
professional,'' Williams said, ``and I didn't even know how to say
his name. I didn't want to sound like a buffoon.''
</P>
<P>
   But given what was at stake, and the way the Sox have been
handled by anyone standing on the rubber regardless of pedigree,
the Red Sox weren't apologizing for the victim of their biggest
output since they beat the Twins, 9-2, Aug. 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, this was a really, really great win,'' said John
Valentin, who saved Wakefield in the third after two-out singles by
Derek Jeter and Paul O'Neill with a sprawling backhanded stop on
Bernie Williams's smash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care how we got it. Yes, we hit a young player who
obviously is coming up. Regardless, we needed to win this game.
Wakefield pitched really well, we hit the ball, and we played good
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what got us here, and hopefully, we can keep the
momentum going.''
</P>
<P>
   Varitek hadn't started a game since doubling home the tying run
off Yankees lefty David Wells eight days ago in a game the Sox won
an inning later on a fan-assisted home run by Valentin. He normally
starts only against lefthanders. But Williams, who threw out his
ninth lineup in nine games, sat Scott Hatteberg.
</P>
<P>
   Varitek committed a couple of passed balls in the first inning,
when the Yankees put runners on second and third but did not score
when Wakefield coaxed a pop fly to right out of Tino Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he hasn't caught me that much in the last month, I'm sure
he's a little nervous about it,'' Wakefield said. ``But the passed
balls don't bother me. I told him, `Relax back there and call a
good game.' He did a wonderful job.''
</P>
<P>
   He did an even better one when he emerged from his crouch.
Following Damon Buford, who worked Jerzembeck for a walk after
falling behind 0-and-2, Varitek hit a 1-and-1 pitch into the lower
deck in right field to make it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   After the Sox scored twice more in the third on singles by
Darren Lewis and Valentin, a wild pitch, and sacrifice fly, Varitek
hit a beer sign on the facing of the third deck off reliever Mike
Buddie for the first two-homer game of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Jerzembeck was no stranger; they were at Georgia Tech together
for a year before the pitcher transferred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just swung the bat and hit it,'' Varitek said. ``They made a
couple of mistakes, a fastball down and in, and a changeup down and
in.''
</P>
<P>
   And instead of another night of feeling down and out, the Red
Sox could head to Baltimore feeling good about themselves again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helped to get the runs early,'' said Lewis, who had two
hits and scored twice after collecting just five hits in his
previous 40 at-bats. ``That gave us the chance to be relaxed and
swing the bat a little bit more.''

EDITORIAL: PREVENTING WORLD RECESSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Sept. 16:
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of a century ago when Washington was mired in scandal,
the greatest challenge to global prosperity since the Great
Depression presented itself in the form of an Arab oil embargo that
promptly led to spiraling inflation, recession in the Western world
and, within a few years, a Third-World debt crisis that stifled
development in Latin America for a generation. The largest
economies were unable to respond to those challenges in a timely
manner, and the world suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Washington immersed in another scandal, another major
threat to world prosperity has arisen from the collapse in Asia and
plunging commodity prices that endanger much of the past decade's
progress in developing countries. There is reason to hope the
response this time will be better. The Group of Seven countries say
they will cooperate in stimulating world growth. Those actions
should include a coordinated lowering of interest rates by central
banks in Europe and America.
</P>
<P>
   The current crisis has brought on a widespread shift in investor
psychology. Those who invested in developing countries with too
little regard for risk now can see only risk as they flee. That
capital flight has forced developing countries to raise interest
rates to protect their currencies, thus putting a further drag on
economies already in recession. Many such countries depend on the
export of commodities, whose prices have plunged as world growth
has slowed. Many companies, particularly in Asia, are unable to
meet their dollar-denominated debt obligations because their home
currencies have collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in an important economic address in New York
this week, was right to say the world must look for ways to
ameliorate those problems by spurring growth in the industrial
world, particularly in Japan, whose own recession could not be
occurring at a worse time. He was also right that ways need to be
found to relieve some of the debts facing Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
   None of that will be easy. In retrospect, the International
Monetary Fund probably pushed for policies that were too
restrictive when the Asian crisis erupted a year ago. But its aid
is needed more than ever in the current situation, as countries
deal with panicky investors.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of the sad state of the Clinton presidency that
the president's effort to address the world's economic problems was
viewed by many through a Monica prism, with commentators wondering
whether Clinton was trying to change the subject. The real question
here is whether the American government can deal effectively with
major problems at the same time Congress considers the Starr
report. Congress should immediately provide the $18 billion needed
by the IMF, and its leaders should make clear that they are open to
further actions that may be needed to avert a world recession.

JOHNNY ADAMS, 67, VOCALIST; ONE OF THE LEGENDS IN BLUES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La.)   (bl)  
 By PETER WATROUS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Johnny Adams, one of the last of the great blues and ballad
singers, died Sept. 14 in Baton Rouge, La., where he lived. He was
67.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said a spokesman for his publicists, Myers
Media, in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Adams was in many ways an anachronism, a singer who could sing
virtually all the prewar styles of American music. And he was an
entertainer, with much of his presentation coming out of a
tradition that included vaudeville; he pretended to play the
trombone, or he would whistle and tell jokes. But his singing was
flawless; he could use the gospel tradition with extraordinary ease
and was also adept at jazz singing.
</P>
<P>
   Adams began his singing career in his hometown of New Orleans,
working in a gospel group, the Soul Revivers. In the mid-1950s, he
sang with Beside Griffin and her Soul Consolators, and made the
change into secular music while singing in a bathtub. His upstairs
neighbor, Dorothy Labostrie, a songwriter, heard his version of
``Precious Lord,'' persuaded him to sing a song of hers, ``Oh
Why,'' and had him signed with the local Ric label. The first
session was produced by Mac Rebennack, 18, later known as Dr. John;
``Oh Why'' was released as ``I Won't Cry'' and was a hit record in
New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, until Adams signed with Rounder Records in 1983,
he worked in unfair obscurity. His singing had a cool sense of
relaxation and a ceaseless caressing of notes. He attacked and
ornamented melodies in endless ways, either leaving them plain, so
the luxury of his voice did the work, or charging them with
falsettos and other gospel filigrees.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time Adams' abilities had come together, jazz and
sophisticated blues singing weren't much in demand. He had small
local hits, and one national success with ``Losing Battle''; it was
widely reported that Berry Gordy Jr. at Motown wanted to sign him,
but his record company threatened to sue.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983 Adams started recording what became a nine-album series
for Rounder, and on these records he moved from a tribute to the
songwriting of Doc Pomus to tunes that have become jazz standards,
like ``Come Rain or Come Shine'' and ``Teach Me Tonight.'' He
recorded ``One Foot in the Blues,'' an album featuring Dr. Lonnie
Smith on organ.
</P>
<P>
   The connection with Rounder, along with an increasing public
appreciation, made him an international concert star, and during
the last decade, he worked regularly. His most recent recording,
``Man of My Word'' (Rounder), was released in August.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Judy.

VALLONE WINS DEMOCRATIC GUBERNATORIAL NOMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to rewrite throughout, with new quotes and updated voting
results)   (mk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Trouncing his opponents in the Democratic
gubernatorial primary, Peter Vallone, the New York City Council
speaker, who has never won office outside his Queens district,
propelled himself Tuesday into a far more daunting struggle against
Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, a first-term Republican, enjoys wide popularity and
faces none of the voter unrest that sent scores of incumbents into
retirement in 1994. Vallone has less than $1 million left in his
campaign treasury, while Pataki, one of the most prodigious
fund-raisers in the nation, has well over $10 million. And Vallone
does not have the Liberal Party nomination, without which no
Democrat has won statewide office in half a century.
</P>
<P>
   As a moderate on social issues who preaches fiscal conservatism,
Vallone, 63, is his party's most centrist gubernatorial nominee in
a generation or more, a potential advantage at a time when many
Democratic voters have turned away from the left.
</P>
<P>
   But he enters the general election campaign with less stature
statewide than any Democratic gubernatorial nominee since at least
1966. Since then, the party's standard-bearers have been Arthur
Goldberg, a former justice of the Supreme Court, Hugh Carey and
Mario Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   Such obstacles did not temper Vallone's enthusiasm as he lit
into Pataki in a victory speech to supporters at the Grand Hyatt
hotel in mid-Manhattan, and tied the governor to his less-popular
mentor, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last four years, Pataki has increased the state's debt
by $20 billion,'' he said. ``We have to put our fiscal house in
order and end the days of George Pataki and Al D'Amato's fiscal
recklessness.''
</P>
<P>
   With a tweak at Pataki's paid speechmaking, he said, ``I
challenge you to one debate for every out-of-state speech you've
given.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's campaign manager, Zenia Mucha, issued a statement
labeling Vallone ``a liberal career politician'' who had ``imposed
billions of dollars of tax increases on working families.''
</P>
<P>
   With 74 percent of precincts reporting, Vallone had 55 percent
of the vote to 21 percent for Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross, 16
percent for Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes, and 8 percent
for James Larocca, a former state transportation commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   McCaughey Ross, a constitutional scholar who entered politics
just four years ago, conceded defeat at 10 p.m. to her supporters
at the Inter-Continental Hotel in mid-Manhattan. But she claimed a
victory of sorts in focusing the race on issues like
prekindergarten schooling, health care and child care.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gubernatorial contest is better for what we have already
done,'' she said. ``The entire gubernatorial contest is more
relevant to the lives of families, of working men and women and
their children than it would have been if we had not entered this
race.''
</P>
<P>
   She said there was ``no question'' she would continue
campaigning as the nominee of the Liberal Party, which would earn
her the animosity of many Democrats. Many of the Democrats who
worked for her campaign planned to abandon it if she lost the
primary.
</P>
<P>
   McCaughey Ross never shook off the images left by her unorthodox
political career, or her well-publicized money troubles in the
stretch run. Her campaign was also hobbled by dissension that saw
several top officials depart.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to seize the interest of voters who seemed either
distracted from the contest or bored by it, McCaughey Ross turned
in the final week to attacking Vallone, questioning his commitment
to abortion rights and education.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks were part of an overt appeal for women's votes, but
exit polls conducted by Edison Media Research showed that she fared
little better among women than men.
</P>
<P>
   The exit polls show that nine out of 10 primary voters said that
more women should be elected to government. But only one-fifth of
those said they had voted for McCaughey Ross.
</P>
<P>
   In the primary for lieutenant governor, Sandra Frankel, a town
supervisor from the Rochester area, easily bested Charlie King, a
Manhattan lawyer, and Clyde Rabideau, the mayor of Plattsburgh,
whom Vallone had tapped as his preferred choice.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel had 52 percent of the vote to 32 percent for King and 16
percent for Rabideau.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Vallone's victory was strikingly broad, cutting across divisions
of race, sex, age, income, education, religion and region. Exit
polls indicate that he even defeated McCaughey Ross by almost 2-1
in upstate New York, where he was virtually unknown six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Council speaker may actually be better known than Pataki was
at this time four years ago, when he was a first-term state
senator. But Vallone lacks a crucial advantage Pataki had in 1994:
the backing of D'Amato, who helped his fellow Republican raise $14
million.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone carries into the seven-week general election campaign
the burden of the assumption, shared even by many in the party,
that the governor is unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   That pessimism has hung like a pall over the Democratic side of
the race from the start. Last year, the two Democrats who were
viewed as the strongest potential challengers to Pataki bowed out,
Rep. Charles Schumer to run for Senate and State Comptroller H.
Carl McCall to run for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign against Pataki could be further complicated by the
presence of two well-known minor-party candidates on the Nov. 3
ballot who could splinter the anti-Pataki vote.
</P>
<P>
   McCaughey Ross is the Liberal Party nominee, and B. Thomas
Golisano, a wealthy Rochester businessman, is running for the
second time on the Independence Party line.
</P>
<P>
   The contest has stirred great interest only through the
soap-operatic travails of McCaughey Ross, Pataki's one-time
protegee, who engaged in a highly public feud with him and who
switched only last year from Republican to Democrat. Throughout the
primary contest, the three other candidates have questioned the
sincerity of her conversion and her positions.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 2, she confirmed what Democrats had long suspected,
that her husband, Wilbur Ross, an investment banker, would not
provide anywhere near the $10 million for her campaign that she had
predicted. Ross withdrew half the $4 million he had given to her
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Ross, who has had little to say publicly about the
matter, released a terse statement saying, ``My office has received
a number of phone calls from reporters today, so I wanted to let
members of the media know that I voted for Betsy today prior to
going out of state on a business trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallone spent more than $3 million on the primary, while Hynes
and Larocca spent less than $1 million between them.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone, a lifelong resident of Astoria, Queens, has spent most
of his years in and around city politics. The son of a judge, he
was a lawyer in private practice, ran for Congress in 1972 _ his
only electoral loss _ and was elected to the City Council in 1973.
Since 1986, he has been chief of the Council, the
second-most-powerful post in city government.
</P>
<P>
   Through much of the year, even as polls showed McCaughey Ross
leading, Vallone largely ignored her, confident that voters would
conclude that he was the only viable Democratic candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Primary voters may have got the message; in exit polls, they
overwhelmingly chose him as the Democrat with the best chance of
beating Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion polls began swinging Vallone's way in midsummer, and
he established a solid lead in the last month, when he began
broadcasting television ads.

MAYOR WINS CHANCE TO TAKE HOUSE SEAT ONCE HELD BY JFK
</HEADLINE>
 
(subs 3rd graf for vote data; subs 12th graf to say Flynn has
conceded)  (Eds.: Also includes results from Rhode Island, Minnesota, Okla.)

<P>
   BOSTON _ Michael Capuano, the mayor of the Boston suburb of
Somerville, fought off nine rivals to inherit one of the most
storied of political seats in the country Tuesday night, winning
the Democratic primary in the 8th Congressional District, which
sent a young John F. Kennedy to Washington more than half a century
ago.
</P>
<P>
   So entrenched are the liberal leanings of the 8th that Capuano
is considered a shoo-in to win the general election in November and
claim the seat of the second Kennedy to hold it, Rep. Joseph P.
Kennedy II, who is retiring. Capuano ran largely on skilled
hometown organization, effective television ads and a can-do record
as mayor that included reducing class size in Somerville schools to
19 pupils.
</P>
<P>
   In the Massachusetts race for governor, Acting Gov. Argeo Paul
Cel- lucci solidly defeated state Treasurer Joseph Malone for the
Republican nomination. Cellucci, who had 58 percent of the vote
with 86 percent of precincts reporting, will face state Attorney
General Scott Harshbarger, who won the Democratic primary Tuesday
with 52 percent of the vote, with 88 percent of precincts
reporting. Political pollsters consider the race between Cellucci
and Harshbarger a toss-up.
</P>
<P>
   In Rhode Island, which also held its primary Tuesday, the stage
is set for a similarly hard-fought governor's race. Lincoln Almond,
the Republican incumbent, who was unopposed, will face a rematch
against former state Sen. Myrth York, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   In the 8th District of Massachusetts, which includes parts of
Boston and several suburbs, early estimates held that only about
75,000 people voted, meaning that with the crowded field of 10
candidates, all it took was a few thousand votes to win _ and
Capuano's Somerville contained 15 percent of the Democratic voters
in the district.
</P>
<P>
   The appetite to vote was blunted by the strong economy combined
with less-than-compelling state-wide races and perhaps a tinge of
added political alienation brought on by the scandal in Washington,
analysts said. Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin
predicted that of the state's 3.3 million registered voters, only
about 1 million would come to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Voting in the 8th District was hampered as well by widespread
confusion among constituents trying to keep the cornucopia of
candidates straight.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Nicolora, a grandmother of 15, who was interviewed after
she voted in North Cambridge, said she had voted for Chris
Gabrieli, a venture capitalist, because ``I liked him from the
start.'' And yet, she said, ``I bounced back and forth between
different ones. I liked the mayor of Somerville.''
</P>
<P>
   It would have been easier, she said, if Kennedy had stayed in
the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hard seat to fill after Joe,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, the eldest son of Robert F. Kennedy, announced that he
was retiring, for now, from politics to devote himself more to
family and business following the New Year's Eve skiing death of
his brother, Michael.
</P>
<P>
   Capuano's victory was snatched from the hands of Raymond Flynn,
the former mayor of Boston and U.S. ambassador to the Vatican, who
had become the early front-runner in the race. He suffered from a
constricted campaign budget and the problem that, though his name
recognition was high, opinions about him among voters were deeply
mixed between a core of strong support and a core of strong
antipathy caused in part by his anti-abortion stance. He conceded
the race to Capuano late Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Polls had also put former state Sen. George Bachrach and former
talk-show host Marjorie Clapprood among the front-runners in a race
that has proved the most expensive congressional contest in
Massachusetts history.
</P>
<P>
   Capuano appeared to have been bolstered in part by relatively
strong turnout in his hometown of Somerville, a densely populated,
well-worn old city of triple-decker houses and confusingly
irregular grids of streets known to confound even the
well-oriented.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, despite the lofty history of the 8th _ which was the
political home of President Kennedy; the longtime House Speaker
Thomas O'Neill; and Boston's ``Rascal King Mayor,'' James Michael
Curley _ the race appeared to devolve down to the most retail of
retail politics. A poll commissioned by The Boston Herald found
that among voters who supported Capuano, a full 44 percent had met
him.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, The Herald noted, 44 percent of respondents said they
had met or seen one of the candidates, compared with the 10 percent
or so of voters who generally meet one of the presidential
candidates in New Hampshire, the capital of retail politics.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nicolora attested to the power of such contact, though for a
different candidate. She voted for Gabrieli in part because she
liked his plan for schools, she said, but also, she added, because
she had met his mother at a picnic.
</P>
<P>
   Primaries were also held Tuesday in Minnesota, North Carolina,
Oklahoma and Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, state Attorney General Hubert H. Humphrey III beat
two other political scions to win the Democratic-Farmer-Labor
Party's nomination for governor. Humphrey, the son of the former
vice president and senator, defeated Mike Freeman, son of former
Gov. Orville Freeman, and Ted Mondale, son of former Vice President
Walter Mondale.
</P>
<P>
   In November Humphrey will face a former Democrat, St. Paul Mayor
Norm Coleman, who easily won the Republican primary. Gov. Arne
Carlson, a Republican, is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   In Oklahoma, Don Carroll defeated a dead opponent, Jacquelyn
Ledgerwood, for the Democratic nomination for the Senate. On Nov.
3, he will face Sen. Don Nickles, a Republican, who was unopposed.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Ms. Ledgerwood died of a heart attack soon after
filing her candidacy, she finished second in an Aug. 25 primary,
requiring a runoff.

SPITZER WINS NEW YORK AG RACE; WILL BATTLE VACCO IN NOVEMBER
ELECTION  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to update voting results in 4th graf)   By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Eliot Spitzer, a wealthy Manhattan lawyer who spent
millions of his own money to finance a campaign for state attorney
general, won the Democratic Party primary nomination on Tuesday,
and will take on the Republican incumbent, Dennis Vacco, in the
November election.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer beat back a challenge from three other Democrats: state
Sen. Catherine Abate; G. Oliver Koppell, a former attorney general;
and Evan Davis, a former counsel to Gov. Mario Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer, a former Manhattan prosecutor who has never held public
office, showed he was a fierce campaigner and a moderate on social
issues.
</P>
<P>
   With 92 percent of the precincts reporting, Spitzer received
254,688 votes, or 42 percent. Ms. Abate received 166,566 votes, or
27 percent; Koppell 134,784 votes, or 22 percent; and Davis 55,678
votes, or 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his immense personal wealth, Spitzer was able to
mount the kind of aggressive media campaign that won him the name
recognition that other candidates appeared to lack. He spent about
$3 million in his primary campaign and plans to spend millions more
for the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's money itself became an issue during the campaign, as
the three other candidates repeatedly accused him of trying to buy
the election. His father is a wealthy Manhattan real estate
developer and lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   For Spitzer, Tuesday's victory was an affirmation of his costly
efforts to rise from political obscurity. In 1994, he spent roughly
$3 million, much of it his own money, in a failed attempt to win
the Democratic nomination for attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long road to get here,'' he told supporters
gathered on Tuesday night at the Broadway Ballroom at the Grand
Hyatt Hotel in Manhattan. ``But tonight, we begin a campaign to
return the majesty and dignity of the attorney general's office.''
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's opponent in November, Vacco, was elected attorney
general in 1994, and is widely viewed as the weakest of the
statewide incumbents up for re-election this year.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco has been accused of undermining the integrity of the
office. Among the complaints are that he fired dozens of lawyers
and replaced them with less experienced ones with ties to the
Republican and Conservative Parties. On at least seven occasions,
his office was criticized for missing filing deadlines and court
dates.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco has also come under attack because he resisted joining a
lawsuit that many other states had filed against tobacco companies
to recoup Medicaid dollars they had spent treating tobacco-related
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually sued, but only after nearly two years of criticism
accusing him of being soft on tobacco companies because they are
major donors to the state Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   More than that, though, poll after poll indicates that Vacco is
not very well known among many New Yorkers. His challenger will
have the opportunity to conduct an aggressive advertising campaign
intended to define Vacco in the minds of voters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Vacco could prove to be a formidable candidate. He has
more than $3.1 million in his campaign coffers and will no doubt
receive more money from the state party should he need it.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, he has shown a talent for getting good publicity on
a variety of consumer-related issues like cracking down on ticket
scalpers and abuses by health insurers. He may also benefit greatly
from the coattails of the popular Republican governor, George
Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes in the race are high. The attorney general's office
has an annual budget of $139 million and a staff of 450 lawyers who
defend the state from hundreds of lawsuits, from charges against
government officials to complaints over accidents on state
property.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for both Vacco and Spitzer will be generating
interest in a race that threatens to be overshadowed by the other
major races, primarily those for governor and U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the primary, the four Democratic candidates for
attorney general complained that they were having a hard time
getting voters to pay attention, let alone choose a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In a race in which there were few ideological differences
between the candidates, the central issue became who had the right
credentials for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer, a partner at a New York City law firm, founded a
nonprofit group, the Center for the Community Interest, that seeks
to help community organizations combat crime and other problems.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abate, who represents Manhattan in the state Senate, has run
a number of major agencies, including the city's Probation and
Correction Departments.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has a long legal background that includes a Supreme Court
clerkship, work on the House Watergate inquiry, and a partnership
at a large New York City law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Koppell, who represented the Bronx in the state Assembly for 23
years, was selected by his colleagues in 1993 to complete the
unexpired term of Robert Abrams as attorney general, though he was
defeated in his bid for a full term in office.

HAS AGE BOXED IN CHAVEZ?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Julio Cesar Chavez has nothing to prove. Certainly
not to the Mexican people, who adore him.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, when he's 36 and showing signs of it, they clamor to
be near him. On Tuesday, three days before his rematch with Oscar
De La Hoya, his limo was rendered immobile in front of Caesars
Palace as the result of a swarming mob.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we'll always love him,'' said Ixchel Serrano, one of many
fans hoping to catch a glimpse of their idol.
</P>
<P>
   For Chavez, however, that's not good enough.
</P>
<P>
   He's getting old (in boxing terms) and he doesn't like it. He's
determined that his ultimate demise in the sport he dominated for
more than a decade will not come at the hands of a pretty-boy
Mexican-American largely disliked by those south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   He gets angry when asked about his age, insisting anything he's
lost physically he makes up for in experience. He gets livid when
asked about his first fight with De La Hoya, which Chavez lost when
it was stopped in the fourth round with blood gushing from a cut
above his left eye.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of observers believe he was saved from a severe
beating. He screams and yells he simply couldn't see, that De La
Hoya's vaunted punches never hurt him, not once, and nothing was
resolved that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``How am I supposed to give him respect when the reason I lost
the fight was because of the cut?'' he said through an interpreter,
referring to De La Hoya's complaint that Chavez didn't give him the
credit he deserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time I'm going to break up his face,'' he added, lightly
punching his own face and gritting his teeth in genuine anger.
</P>
<P>
   His fans believe him. And it's not difficult to understand why.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is he Mexico's greatest champion, going undefeated in
91 straight fights and six championships in a country largely void
of world-class sports stars, he is also its greatest schmoozer.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez is a man of the people: He LOVES to be among them, in the
gym, in a restaurant, in a mall, on the street, anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Emanuel Steward, one of the few Americans to witness the
phenomenon first-hand in Mexico, tells this story:
</P>
<P>
   ``One time, in Monterrey, before the Tony Lopez fight (in 1994),
Julio decided he wanted to walk to a mall about three blocks from
where we were staying. By the time we got there, there were
hundreds of people walking and running and laughing with him. And
he just loved it, absolutely loved it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like it, not with Ali, not with
anyone. No one will replace him in the hearts of those people.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Serrano, the fan in Las Vegas: ``It's because he allows
himself to be just one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why these aren't easy times for his fans. Some refuse to
believe he's declining. At a recent news conference in downtown
L.A., Chavez supporters who booed De La Hoya in his own howetown
said straight-faced that the old man would win this time even
though he's an 8-1 underdog. Love can be blinding.
</P>
<P>
   Others are more realistic.
</P>
<P>
   Several of those at the news conference admitted quietly, so no
one else could hear, they're speaking with their hearts when they
predict Chavez will win, while Serrano said simply, ``Yeah, it's
sad'' to watch his decline.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez seems to be the same person who once seemed unbeatable,
the same fun-loving, always-smiling kid-at-heart with the gift of
bringing joy to those around him.
</P>
<P>
   This in spite of personal problems, including a gargantuan tax
debt in Mexico, and eroding skills.
</P>
<P>
   In a candid moment recently, he longed for an earlier, less
complicated time. When asked what he would chose if he could have
anything in the world, he said, ``My youth.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, perhaps as soon as Friday, he'll have to be
satisfied with the love of his people.

HUBERT HUMPHREY III WINS DFLL NOMINATION FOR MINNESOTA GOVERNOR
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Hubert H. Humphrey III, who bears this state's
most revered political name, easily won the Democratic-Farmer-Labor
Party nomination for governor of Minnesota on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey, the son and namesake of the former vice president and
the state's attorney general for the last 16 years, will face the
Republican nominee, Mayor Norm Coleman of St. Paul, who switched
parties two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a race stocked with famous Minnesota names, Humphrey, known
throughout the state as Skip, touted his role in bringing a public
health lawsuit against tobacco companies that ended in a $6.1
billion settlement for the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic also-rans included offspring of some of the most
famous names in the state's political, civic and business orbits:
Ted Mondale, the son of former Vice President Walter Mondale; Mike
Freeman, the son of former Gov. Orville Freeman, and Mark Dayton,
an heir to the Dayton Hudson department store conglomerate, which
owns the Target chain. A fifth candidate, Doug Johnson, a state
senator, campaigned as the only candidate who came from a common
worker's background.
</P>
<P>
   A third-party candidate, Jesse Ventura, a former professional
wrestler who had been a mayor of a Minneapolis suburb, is running
on the Reform Party label.
</P>
<P>
   With 58 percent of precincts reporting, Humphrey had 38 percent,
to Freeman's 20 percent. Mondale was a distant fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey, 56, shares his father's generally populist stance but
is not as enthusiastic or impassioned an orator as the elder
Humphrey, who was called the Happy Warrior.
</P>
<P>
   Besides lauding his victory over the tobacco giants, Humphrey
campaigned for higher spending on education.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, 49, wasted no time in kicking off campaign broadsides
against his Democratic opponent, saying that Humphrey represented
``the old vision of tax and spend'' liberals. Coleman said that he
would be tough with street gangs and cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Brooklyn, N.Y., who was one of eight children, Mr.
Coleman sought to portray himself as the candidate with a feel for
common people. In a statement obviously meant to bring comparisons
with Humphrey, the Republican boasted that he had ``never had a
silver spoon in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary saw a turnout of only about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Primaries were also held on Tuesday in North Carolina, Oklahoma
and Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   In Oklahoma, Don Carroll defeated a dead opponent, Jacquelyn
Ledgerwood, for the Democratic nomination for the Senate. On Nov.
3, he will face Sen. Don Nickles, a Republican, who was unopposed.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington state, Republicans settled a bitter Senate
primary, nominating Rep. Linda Smith, a conservative, over Chris
Bayley, a moderate. Ms. Smith will challenge Sen. Patty Murray.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Minnesota, Humphrey's famous name and his record as attorney
general had cast him as the heavy favorite in the race.
</P>
<P>
   A traditionally liberal state, Minnesota has been the most
reliably Democratic state in presidential elections for a
generation. Unusual in a state that is 95 percent white, Democrats
control both houses in the state legislature.
</P>
<P>
   But the state's population is changing in ways that could help
Republicans, growing fastest in the outer-ring suburbs where people
are more likely to hold conservative political values.

nomination for governor of Minnesota on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey _ the son and namesake of the late vice president,
senator and 1968 presidential nominee _ has been the state's
attorney general for the last 16 years. He will face the Republican
nominee, St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman, who switched parties two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a race stocked with famous Minnesota names, Humphrey, known
throughout the state as Skip, touted his role in bringing a public
health lawsuit against tobacco companies that ended in a $6.1
billion settlement for the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic also-rans included offspring of some of the most
famous names in the state's political, civic and business orbits:
Ted Mondale, the son of former Vice President Walter Mondale; Mike
Freeman, the son of former Gov. Orville Freeman, and Mark Dayton,
an heir to the Dayton Hudson department store conglomerate, which
owns the Target chain. A fifth candidate, state Sen. Doug Johnson,
campaigned as the only candidate who came from a common worker's
background.
</P>
<P>
   A third-party candidate, Jesse Ventura, a former professional
wrestler who had been a mayor of a Minneapolis suburb, is running
on the Reform Party label.
</P>
<P>
   With 58 percent of precincts reporting, Humphrey had 38 percent
of the vote, to Freeman's 20 percent. Mondale was a distant fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey, 56, shares his father's generally populist stance, but
is not as enthusiastic or impassioned an orator as the elder
Humphrey, who was called the Happy Warrior.
</P>
<P>
   Besides lauding his victory over the tobacco giants, Humphrey
campaigned for higher spending on education, including subsidies
that would pay for the first two years of tuition at any state
public or private college.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, 49, wasted no time in kicking off campaign broadsides
against his Democratic opponent, saying that Humphrey represented
``the old vision of tax-and-spend'' liberals. Coleman said that he
would be tough with street gangs and cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Brooklyn, N.Y., native who was one of eight
children, Coleman sought to portray himself as the candidate with a
feel for common people. In a statement obviously meant to bring
comparisons with Humphrey, the Republican boasted that he had
``never had a silver spoon in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary saw a turnout of about 20 percent, considered quite
low with a field of big-name candidates. Dayton was the biggest
spender in the race, using his own money in a $1.8 million
campaign. Freeman won the party's endorsement.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Primaries were also held Tuesday in North Carolina, Oklahoma and
Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   In Oklahoma, Don Carroll defeated a dead opponent, Jacquelyn
Ledgerwood, for the Democratic nomination for the Senate. On Nov.
3, he will face Sen. Don Nickles, a Republican, who was unopposed.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington state, Republicans settled a bitter Senate
primary, nominating Rep. Linda Smith, a conservative, over Chris
Bayley, a moderate. Ms. Smith will challenge Sen. Patty Murray.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, Humphrey's famous name and his record as attorney
general had cast him as the heavy favorite in the race.
</P>
<P>
   A traditionally liberal state, Minnesota has been the most
reliably Democratic state in presidential elections for a
generation. Unusual in a state that is 95 percent white, Democrats
control both houses in the state legislature.
</P>
<P>
   But the state's population is changing in ways that could help
Republicans, growing fastest in the outer-ring suburbs where people
are more likely to hold conservative political values.

ENTERTAINMENT REVENUE POISED TO EXPLODE IN NEXT DECADE, EXPERT
SAYS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Americans' hunger for entertainment -- and the
high-speed communications used to deliver it to all points of the
globe -- will grow even more insatiable in the coming decade,
pushing growth in those industries faster than the rest of the
country's economy, a leading analyst said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American public's appetite for media consumption is
soaring,'' said Paul Kagan, chairman and chief executive officer of
the firm that conducted the study. ``The creators of entertainment
and information technology and content are constantly finding new
ways to reach and satisfy their audience.''
</P>
<P>
   The Paul Kagan Associates study projects that U.S.
entertainment/communications revenue will more than double over the
next decade, going from $365 billion last year to an astounding
$793 billion in 2007. That means each household will be spending
$4,211 a year on such diverse areas as TV, movies, the Internet,
pagers, newspapers and theme parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if Americans are beginning to interpret life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness as equivalent to access to basic
cable, a VCR and a ticket to `Titanic,' '' Lawrence Gerbrandt, a
Kagan senior vice president, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Marx, a Michigan-based business consultant, said the
Kagan report's conclusions bear out current evidence that Americans
are finding more ways to spend more time and money in pursuit of
information and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are making every minute count in seeking out more even
when you think that there's no way that they can absorb any more,''
he said. ``America loves to be in the know and to see how much they
can absorb. Even with cell phones, pagers and faxes, I get as many
phone calls as I used to.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kagan report, which was released Monday, projects that the
nation's media/entertainment industry will grow at an annual rate
of 8.1 percent for the next nine years -- about double the expected
expansion rate of the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
   The fastest-growing sector by far will be the Internet, where
revenues should grow from $6.1 billion last year to $63.1 billion
in 2007. Gerbrandt said the recent decision by Congress to release
Kenneth Starr's report on President Clinton on the Internet
underscores its growing acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The release of the report validates the Internet, which is
certainly the most efficient and democratic communications (medium)
so far, in the same way that CNN's coverage of the Gulf War was a
validation of the whole cable concept,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gerbrandt said the projections of Internet revenue gains are
being driven partly by widespread adaption in the workplace.
``People are using the Web to make their lives more efficient, to
shift their time around,'' he said. ``You can book your next
vacation even though your agent has gone to bed.''
</P>
<P>
   The report says wireless telecommunications also will post an
impressive gain from $33.5 billion to $111.7 billion in 2007 for
similar reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The report did not include basic phone service in the
compilation because of its status as a utility, like water and
electricity, that everyone has as part of everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   The third-fastest growth area will be cable and satellite TV,
which will grow from $33.8 billion last year to $91.2 billion in
2007 as new services come online, such as digital programming and
high-speed data and telephone service. Many large cable-TV
companies are planning upgrades to two-way interactive systems, and
Kagan said consumers are demanding products and services that merge
the digital world with entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Market demand has led to competition and convergence, the
buzzwords for the 21st century,'' he said. ``They're the matches
that have set the media on fire. For example, we are only beginning
to see the explosion of TV channels that will result from the new
digital revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall consumer spending in entertainment/communications will
grow by an average of 9.2 percent annually and hit $460 billion in
nine years. Media advertising will grow by 6.8 percent annually and
reach $333 billion in 2007.
</P>
<P>
   Even an established area like publishing will see annual growth
of 5.3 percent each. Despite extensive worries about the future of
the printed word, publishing will remain the largest sector with
revenues of $205 billion in 2007.
</P>
<P>
   Marx said growth also will be driven by the marketing savvy and
muscle of worldwide media conglomerates such as News Corp., Walt
Disney Co. and Time Warner -- each of which owns movie studios, TV
networks, publishing houses, theme parks, publications and sports
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The messages are everywhere,'' Marx said. ``As I was pumping
gas today, there was a message that came across the screen on the
pump about Frito-Lay. You're going to see it in less-traditional
places.''
</P>
<P>
   Marx said the pervasive message from TV and movies will keep
consumers spending. ``There are more disposable dollars, and
everybody thinks they're entitled to the lifestyle of choice,'' he
said. ``When you watch shows on TV, you never see anyone living in
poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Celente, publisher of the Trends Journal, said the Kagan
projections sound realistic but disputed the notion of the Internet
receiving widespread use as entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computer technology will continue to make spectacular gains as
a financial, research and commercial tool, but the digital
revolution has grossly oversold it as an entertainment medium that
will supplant the established medium,'' Celente said. ``It will
come to pass, but we don't see it happening for another 10 years.''

SCHUMER BEATS FERRARO IN SENATE PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (updates throught with vote totals, concessions, rewriting)  (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also moving in ``p'' news file) 
(bl) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rep. Charles Schumer of Brooklyn, reaping the fruits
of a decade of fund-raising and a campaign of ceaseless television
advertising, won the Democratic nomination to challenge Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato on Tuesday night, overwhelming Geraldine Ferraro in
her second attempt to return to public office.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer easily defeated both Ferraro and the third major
candidate, New York City Public Advocate Mark Green in a victory
that showed strength that crossed geographic, sex and ethnic lines.
Schumer's performance suggested that he had gone some distance in
erasing doubts many Democrats once said they had about his
viability as a challenger to D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   The results also signaled an end to one of the most notable
political careers of the last 20 years. Ferraro had characterized
her second bid for the Senate as an attempt to gain a nomination
that she believed was unfairly denied her in 1992 because of
unfounded attacks on her ethics. She was spared such attacks this
time, but nonetheless posted a far worse showing than she did in
1992, when she lost by just 11,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro, who came to national attention when she ran for vice
president in 1984, promptly declared an end to her career in
politics. ``Now, my campaign for United States Senate and for any
future elective office ends,'' she said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic primary voters also chose New York City Council
Speaker Peter Vallone to challenge Gov. George Pataki in a primary
that turned out to be far less competitive than had been expected.
Vallone easily defeated three candidates, including Lt. Gov. Betsy
McCaughey Ross, the former Republican running in a Democratic
primary for the first time. McCaughey Ross' name will still appear
on the Liberal Party line in November.
</P>
<P>
   Eliot Spitzer, a lawyer who used his family fortune to finance
his campaign, was nominated for state attorney general. And Sandra
Frankel, a town supervisor from a suburb of Rochester, won the race
to run with Vallone as the Democratic candidate for lieutenant
governor.
</P>
<P>
   With 89 percent of precincts counted, Schumer had 277,714 votes,
51 percent; Ferraro had 141,793 votes, 26 percent, and Green
103,096 votes, 19 percent. Eric Ruano Melendez, a fourth Democratic
candidate, took 21,686 votes, 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's victory came on a day of notably low voter turnout,
reflecting an absence of interest in the contests. The turnout
figures were being closely watched by Democratic leaders, concerned
that President Clinton's difficulties in Washington could depress
interest among party members, and hurt Democratic efforts to defeat
D'Amato and Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate primary came to a quick and genial end within less
than 90 minutes after the polls closed. The three major Democrats
shared compliments, and pledged to work together in the seven weeks
of the general election campaign. Green called Schumer at 9:02
Tuesday night, and Ferraro at 9:34.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, grinning and elated as he danced, awkwardly, onto the
stage to the sounds of ``You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet'' at the Grand
Hyatt Hotel, accepted the nomination with a muscular speech that
clearly signaled that his primary strategy of ignoring his
opponents had come to an end. He immediately attacked D'Amato,
asserting that the senator was untrustworthy, had been in office
too long and consistently voted against the interests of his state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This all comes down to trust,'' Schumer said to a packed
ballroom. ``Who do you trust to fight for New York families? Who do
you trust to stand up for what is right?
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have learned one thing in the last 18 years, it is that
Al D'Amato has been in the Senate for too long. You just can't
trust him to do the right thing, and New Yorkers deserve a senator
we can be proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro conceded at 10:15 Tuesday night, leaving no doubt that
she would work on behalf of the Democratic ticket. She praised
Schumer's campaign and added, ``I say tonight to Al D'Amato, `Watch
out,' because Chuck Schumer's coming and there's no doubt that he's
going to beat you.''
</P>
<P>
   Green said he had succeeded in setting much of the tone of the
race. ``For any of you who might feel disappointed with the result
tonight, don't,'' Green said. ``That's an order from your public
advocate.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the Senate vote sets the stage for what is almost
sure to be one of the most ferociously fought races in the country
this fall. Schumer and D'Amato are both known in Washington as
streetwise, ambitious politicians who share talents for raising
money, getting publicity and assailing their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer has spent much of this decade quietly preparing himself
for the statewide stage, and D'Amato, facing what polls have long
suggested would be a difficult bid for a fourth term, has been
preparing for this re-election almost from the moment he won his
third term in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the polls were closed Tuesday, Schumer's media
consultant, Hank Morris, was in a television editing booth,
producing advertisements directed at D'Amato that will be broadcast
in the next two days, thus avoiding a mistake that Democrats made
in the last race. And even before Schumer had made his way out to
declare victory Tuesday night, the D'Amato campaign issued a
withering statement reprising what has been the senator's standard
attack on Democratic candidates: that they are too liberal.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again the Democratic Party has nominated the most
left-of-center candidate they could,'' said D'Amato's campaign
manager, Jon Lerner. ``In November, the voters will have a clear
choice between Chuck Schumer, who believes in old-style
tax-and-spend liberalism, and Al D'Amato, who has a proven record
of fighting for the forgotten middle class.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 primary shaped up as a sharp setback for women who have
been seeking to break into the upper ranks of New York state
government. Earlier this year, it seemed that the Democrats might
have three women on the statewide ticket: Ferraro for senator, Ms.
McCaughey Ross for governor and Catherine Abate for attorney
general. There will now be only two women running for statewide
office as major party candidates. Ms. Frankel and Mary Donohue, a
Republican, will oppose each other for lieutenant governor, a
position of virtually no importance in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro and Ms. McCaughey Ross explicitly presented their
candidacies as appeals for women to gain political stature in New
York, a state that has never elected a woman as senator or
governor. ``If they turn out, I win this,'' Ferraro said of women
during a last campaign appearance Tuesday. But the voter survey
found that most women disregarded those appeals, voting instead for
Schumer and Vallone.
</P>
<P>
   The contest to challenge D'Amato was remarkable for its lack of
open conflict, as the candidates avoided the kind of exchanges that
characterized the 1992 primary. Schumer used his victory speech to
make note of that, making a point of praising Green and Ferraro in
a clear message to D'Amato that the party would display a unity
this year that was absent in 1992, and that many party members
blamed for leading to D'Amato's victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We proved that Democrats could run a race on the issues,
without attacks,'' Schumer said. ``That is why Democrats enter this
race strong. That is why we will all join hands tomorrow in
unity.''
</P>
<P>
   One benefit of the decorous race will become clear Wednesday
morning, when all three Democratic Senate candidates are to appear
at a breakfast together with state party chairwoman Judith Hope. In
1992, by contrast, Ferraro did not endorse the Democratic
candidate, Robert Abrams, until the last week of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's strong performance reflected a campaign that even his
rivals described as largely flawless: from the start, he avoided
making attacks on his opponents and spoke about his record in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also clear tribute to the influence of money on
American politics today. Schumer, who is a member of the House
Banking Committee, raised $13 million for the race, more than five
times as much as either Ferraro or Green.

CALIFORNIA ADULTS EATING FEWER FRUITS, VEGGIES, STUDY SHOWS

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Think carrot juice is just for old Bugs Bunny?
Prefer a shot of vodka to a shot of wheatgrass? Choose a dripping
burger with cheese rather than a cucumber-and-alfalfa-sprout
sandwich?
</P>
<P>
   Join the unhealthy California club.
</P>
<P>
   Two of three Californians are not getting the recommended daily
serving of five fruits and vegetables, a study released Tuesday by
the state Department of Health Services shows.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, most Californians eat only 3.8 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Those findings have health officials predicting dire
consequences for the state's population.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we know is that if you eat the minimum five
servings, that helps prevent cancer, heart disease and stroke,''
said Trinette Beauchemin, Health Services spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``To look at the big picture, 35,000 deaths in California each
year are the result of preventable disease related to poor diet.
Statewide, $15 million is spent on health-care costs related to
those sicknesses.''
</P>
<P>
   A diet complete with the five daily servings prevents 30 percent
of cancer cases, 25 percent of strokes and 30 percent of premature
heart attacks, according to the Department of Health Services.
</P>

   The department has studied Californians' diets every two years
since 1989, and this was the first time the state's adults were
found to be cutting back on their fruits and vegetables. Indeed,
Californians now eat less fresh produce than the average American,
the study showed.
</P>
<P>
   Lunchers in suburban Woodland Hills on Tuesday said the study
won't change their eating patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like vegetables, so I don't eat them,'' said Sloane
McHenry, 25, as she finished off her turkey burger with cheese,
french fries and iced tea.
</P>
<P>
   McHenry is a living testament to a sign on the wall of the
Fatburger restaurant where she was eating: ``Studies show you like
fries and a drink with your hamburger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The few times I actually cook at home, I make some veggies,''
she said. ``But I never go to a hamburger place that serves a
burger with green beans.''
</P>
<P>
   Convenience is the top reason why Californians skip some of
their five-a-day servings, the study showed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to get fruits and vegetables in your average
fast-food restaurant,'' Beauchemin said. ``It's ironic . . . in a
state that provides 50 percent of the agriculture for the whole
country.''
</P>
<P>
   The second reason for a poor diet was lack of knowledge about
preparing fruits and vegetables, and lifestyle issues were the
third cause, the state report says.
</P>
<P>
   Of 11 people who stopped eating their lunches Tuesday long
enough to talk about their diets, only three said they regularly
get their daily supply of healthy fruit and vegetables. And each of
those three admitted his wife or mother does the cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Nyall London depends on his wife to make sure he gets his
vegetables, and he concentrates on taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have veggies at dinner. My wife cooks it,'' London said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the plate, the researchers found that,
among Californians concerned with a proper diet, one in three
favors health-food restaurants, such as the juice bars that are
proliferating across the city.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Fickel, 28, takes a daily dose of wheatgrass and a healthy
juice drink at least weekly. ``I do it because of the way it makes
me feel,'' she said.

SCHUMER BEATS FERRARO IN SENATE PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (updates throught with vote totals, concessions, rewriting)  (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also moving in ``a'' news file) 
(th) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rep. Charles Schumer of Brooklyn, reaping the fruits
of a decade of fund-raising and a campaign of ceaseless television
advertising, won the Democratic nomination to challenge Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato on Tuesday night, overwhelming Geraldine Ferraro in
her second attempt to return to public office.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer easily defeated both Ferraro and the third major
candidate, New York City Public Advocate Mark Green in a victory
that showed strength that crossed geographic, sex and ethnic lines.
Schumer's performance suggested that he had gone some distance in
erasing doubts many Democrats once said they had about his
viability as a challenger to D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   The results also signaled an end to one of the most notable
political careers of the last 20 years. Ferraro had characterized
her second bid for the Senate as an attempt to gain a nomination
that she believed was unfairly denied her in 1992 because of
unfounded attacks on her ethics. She was spared such attacks this
time, but nonetheless posted a far worse showing than she did in
1992, when she lost by just 11,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro, who came to national attention when she ran for vice
president in 1984, promptly declared an end to her career in
politics. ``Now, my campaign for United States Senate and for any
future elective office ends,'' she said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic primary voters also chose New York City Council
Speaker Peter Vallone to challenge Gov. George Pataki in a primary
that turned out to be far less competitive than had been expected.
Vallone easily defeated three candidates, including Lt. Gov. Betsy
McCaughey Ross, the former Republican running in a Democratic
primary for the first time. McCaughey Ross' name will still appear
on the Liberal Party line in November.
</P>
<P>
   Eliot Spitzer, a lawyer who used his family fortune to finance
his campaign, was nominated for state attorney general. And Sandra
Frankel, a town supervisor from a suburb of Rochester, won the race
to run with Vallone as the Democratic candidate for lieutenant
governor.
</P>
<P>
   With 89 percent of precincts counted, Schumer had 277,714 votes,
51 percent; Ferraro had 141,793 votes, 26 percent, and Green
103,096 votes, 19 percent. Eric Ruano Melendez, a fourth Democratic
candidate, took 21,686 votes, 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's victory came on a day of notably low voter turnout,
reflecting an absence of interest in the contests. The turnout
figures were being closely watched by Democratic leaders, concerned
that President Clinton's difficulties in Washington could depress
interest among party members, and hurt Democratic efforts to defeat
D'Amato and Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate primary came to a quick and genial end within less
than 90 minutes after the polls closed. The three major Democrats
shared compliments, and pledged to work together in the seven weeks
of the general election campaign. Green called Schumer at 9:02
Tuesday night, and Ferraro at 9:34.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, grinning and elated as he danced, awkwardly, onto the
stage to the sounds of ``You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet'' at the Grand
Hyatt Hotel, accepted the nomination with a muscular speech that
clearly signaled that his primary strategy of ignoring his
opponents had come to an end. He immediately attacked D'Amato,
asserting that the senator was untrustworthy, had been in office
too long and consistently voted against the interests of his state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This all comes down to trust,'' Schumer said to a packed
ballroom. ``Who do you trust to fight for New York families? Who do
you trust to stand up for what is right?
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have learned one thing in the last 18 years, it is that
Al D'Amato has been in the Senate for too long. You just can't
trust him to do the right thing, and New Yorkers deserve a senator
we can be proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro conceded at 10:15 Tuesday night, leaving no doubt that
she would work on behalf of the Democratic ticket. She praised
Schumer's campaign and added, ``I say tonight to Al D'Amato, `Watch
out,' because Chuck Schumer's coming and there's no doubt that he's
going to beat you.''
</P>
<P>
   Green said he had succeeded in setting much of the tone of the
race. ``For any of you who might feel disappointed with the result
tonight, don't,'' Green said. ``That's an order from your public
advocate.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the Senate vote sets the stage for what is almost
sure to be one of the most ferociously fought races in the country
this fall. Schumer and D'Amato are both known in Washington as
streetwise, ambitious politicians who share talents for raising
money, getting publicity and assailing their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer has spent much of this decade quietly preparing himself
for the statewide stage, and D'Amato, facing what polls have long
suggested would be a difficult bid for a fourth term, has been
preparing for this re-election almost from the moment he won his
third term in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the polls were closed Tuesday, Schumer's media
consultant, Hank Morris, was in a television editing booth,
producing advertisements directed at D'Amato that will be broadcast
in the next two days, thus avoiding a mistake that Democrats made
in the last race. And even before Schumer had made his way out to
declare victory Tuesday night, the D'Amato campaign issued a
withering statement reprising what has been the senator's standard
attack on Democratic candidates: that they are too liberal.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again the Democratic Party has nominated the most
left-of-center candidate they could,'' said D'Amato's campaign
manager, Jon Lerner. ``In November, the voters will have a clear
choice between Chuck Schumer, who believes in old-style
tax-and-spend liberalism, and Al D'Amato, who has a proven record
of fighting for the forgotten middle class.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 primary shaped up as a sharp setback for women who have
been seeking to break into the upper ranks of New York state
government. Earlier this year, it seemed that the Democrats might
have three women on the statewide ticket: Ferraro for senator, Ms.
McCaughey Ross for governor and Catherine Abate for attorney
general. There will now be only two women running for statewide
office as major party candidates. Ms. Frankel and Mary Donohue, a
Republican, will oppose each other for lieutenant governor, a
position of virtually no importance in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro and Ms. McCaughey Ross explicitly presented their
candidacies as appeals for women to gain political stature in New
York, a state that has never elected a woman as senator or
governor. ``If they turn out, I win this,'' Ferraro said of women
during a last campaign appearance Tuesday. But the voter survey
found that most women disregarded those appeals, voting instead for
Schumer and Vallone.
</P>
<P>
   The contest to challenge D'Amato was remarkable for its lack of
open conflict, as the candidates avoided the kind of exchanges that
characterized the 1992 primary. Schumer used his victory speech to
make note of that, making a point of praising Green and Ferraro in
a clear message to D'Amato that the party would display a unity
this year that was absent in 1992, and that many party members
blamed for leading to D'Amato's victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We proved that Democrats could run a race on the issues,
without attacks,'' Schumer said. ``That is why Democrats enter this
race strong. That is why we will all join hands tomorrow in
unity.''
</P>
<P>
   One benefit of the decorous race will become clear Wednesday
morning, when all three Democratic Senate candidates are to appear
at a breakfast together with state party chairwoman Judith Hope. In
1992, by contrast, Ferraro did not endorse the Democratic
candidate, Robert Abrams, until the last week of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's strong performance reflected a campaign that even his
rivals described as largely flawless: from the start, he avoided
making attacks on his opponents and spoke about his record in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also clear tribute to the influence of money on
American politics today. Schumer, who is a member of the House
Banking Committee, raised $13 million for the race, more than five
times as much as either Ferraro or Green.

METS SPLIT DOUBLEHEADER WITH ASTROS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ As if there were not enough tension as their season
dwindles to its final games, no day seems complete for the New York
Mets without a late-innings comeback.
</P>
<P>
   There were two more of them here on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud's three run home run off Mike Magnante in the eighth
inning, his 20th homer of the season, erased a 3-2 Houston lead and
helped give Al Leiter (16-5) an 8-4 victory in the second game of
the doubleheader. The Mets had also rallied in the first before
losing, 6-5, in 12 agonizing innings on Derek Bell's 21st home run.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's leadoff blast to left field off the rookie right-hander
Jeff Tam (1-1) came after Jeff Bagwell had kept the Astros alive
with a leadoff homer in the 11th inning off John Franco to tie the
score again. Both offset another game-tying ninth-inning homer from
the Mets, this time by Carlos Baerga.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second day in a row that the Mets had erased a
two-run Houston lead with a two-run homer in the ninth. Brian McRae
had done the same on Monday night, and the Mets went on to win in
13 innings.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, after Baerga's dramatic shot off Scott Elarton
had sent the game into extra innings, the Astros rallied back after
Baerga and Rey Ordonez had delivered back-to-back two-out doubles
in the top of the 11th.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' loss left them a half-game behind the Chicago Cubs in
the National League wild-card race, and in the nightcap, the Mets
(85-68) were in danger of falling further behind. They trailed by
3-2 heading into the eighth inning after the Astros had scored
twice off Leiter in the fifth. But Olerud followed a C.J. Nitkowski
walk to Edgardo Alfonzo and a Mike Piazza single off Jay Powell
with his three-run home run off Magnante for a 5-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been funny how we've had a lot of really big home runs
late in ball games,'' Olerud said. ``But I don't think you can
explain it. Believe me, we'd like to have some 14-3 ball games. It
just hasn't worked out that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Turk Wendell (who pitched well in both games) bailed Leiter out
of a jam in the bottom of the eighth after the Astros had scored a
run, and the Mets would score three more times in the ninth to stay
close to the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter pitched seven-plus innings, giving up four runs, seven
hits and six walks with four strikeouts. Wendell came on after
Leiter had walked Richard Hidalgo to open the eighth and then
allowed a bloop single to Pete Incaviglia, with Hidalgo taking
third. Leiter's first pitch to Ricky Gutierrez was a wild pitch,
and in came Wendell with the tying run on second and nobody out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the smoothest seven innings,'' Leiter said. ``I was
in a lot of jams. But the guys in the bullpen were tired, so I knew
I had to go out and go as deep as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   As Leiter struggled, Mets Manager Bobby Valentine said the
bullpen coach, Randy Niemann, did an ``arm check'' of his pitchers.
``Nemo said, `Who can go?''' Valentine said, ``and Turk was the
first in line.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendell responded with two scoreless innings for his third save.
After the final out, Wendell bounded off the mound in celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Piazza told me, `Don't blow a gasket, we've still got some
work to do,'' Wendell said.
</P>
<P>
   Wendell, who also pitched a scoreless inning and two-thirds in
the first game, said he was tired, but was quick to respond when
asked whether he could pitch Wednesday. ``Sure,'' he said, ``I'll
go tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first game, after Baerga hit his ninth-inning homer _
just his sixth home run of the season _ Jay Payton, who has had his
elbow rebuilt twice, delivered a perfect one-hop throw to Todd
Hundley from left field to cut down Tim Bogar at the plate with the
potential winning run in the bottom of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   And then Baerga, who had been mired in a terrible slump, doubled
to left center with two out in the top of the 11th for his fourth
hit of the game. When Ordonez, who earlier had belted his first
homer since Sept. 2, 1997, followed with a run-scoring double to
right-center field, the Mets looked as if they were headed for
their second improbable comeback victory in as many nights.
</P>
<P>
   All they needed was three outs. But Franco, who had closed out
Monday night's victory for his franchise-record 37th save,
surrendered a leadoff home run to Bagwell on his fourth pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to get the ball in on him; it sunk away, and he's a
low-ball hitter,'' said Franco, who had warmed up three times each
before both his appearances Monday and Tuesday. ``I just missed my
location. It may have come from a little bit of a tired arm.''
</P>
<P>
   And even though Franco, who had converted 16 straight save
opportunities since he had last blown one on Aug. 4, eventually
struck out Carl Everett with runners on first and third to end the
11th, the Mets left runners on second and third in the top of the
12th. And then Bell blasted his shot into the left-field seats off
Tam to tie his career high with his 21st home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of ball game,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said between
games. ``It was a really good one. A good hitter got a home run off
a good pitcher. We did everything we could.''

SCOTT MASON, 50, EX-PROFESSOR AT HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Maine, Mass.)   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scott P. Mason, a former chairman of the finance department at
Harvard University's business school, died Sept. 8 at his home in
Wellesley, Mass. He was 50.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was cancer, said his wife, Linda.
</P>
<P>
   Mason joined the faculty of the Graduate School of Business
Administration at Harvard in 1980. He was the chairman of the
finance department from 1993 to 1997. During his tenure, he
introduced financial engineering, which is the use of mathematical
models to assess the value of financial instruments like bonds and
stocks, into the business curriculum. The use of financial
engineering to predict what will happen in a business or market
area is considered comparable to the use of meteorological models
in weather forecasting.
</P>
<P>
   Robert C. Merton, a Nobel laureate who taught Mason as a
graduate student at MIT in the 1970s and worked with him on the
faculty at Harvard, credits Mason with making the use of
mathematical models an integral part of the courses at the business
school. When Mason was a graduate student, his thesis was on
financial engineering.
</P>
<P>
   At Harvard, Mason created a capital markets course for
second-year students. Merton said that Mason refined the
mathematical models and applied them in research, in the classroom
and in practice.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Presque Isle, Maine, Mason graduated from the
University of Maine in 1969. He received a master's degree at MIT
in 1972 and a doctorate of finance there in 1979. Before going to
Harvard, Mason worked at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Mason was named president and chief executive of
Investment Technology Group, a brokerage house in New York, after
having served as a consultant and director.
</P>
<P>
   Mason is survived by his wife, Linda; a daughter, Meredith; a
son, Aaron, all of Wellesley; his mother, Patricia, of South
Natick, Mass., and a sister, Paige Mason, of Wellesley.

ARROJO EASILY HANDLES ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Angels manager Terry Collins watched his
team crumple to Rolando Arrojo and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays on
Tuesday night 8-1, then unleashed his frustration to reporters
about what he perceived as a lack of focus.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Collins and his players were asked often about
the series with the Texas Rangers, which starts today. And then
there was the issue of playoff tickets.
</P>
<P>
   It seems some players were upset when they received a memo
before the game, which they understood to say they had to pay for
their playoff tickets. It turns out the players would have to pay
for any tickets OVER their normal allotment. Collins thought the
confusion about the tickets and the talk of Texas distracted his
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can finally put our attention on Texas now,'' an animated
Collins said. ``There are no secrets, no hidden agendas. We don't
have to worry about playoff tickets, starting right now. I don't
care about where we park, where they put the ushers on the dugout,
I don't care about anything else but winning baseball games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's wondering about (the Rangers). Well, we've got to
forget about everything except playing baseball. Forget about how
hot it is, forget about how big the crowds are, or if it's cool
enough on the bus and worry about playing a game (today).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always something. We're worried about tickets. It was not
explained to them and they got upset about it. Well, if we don't
win in the next 12 days, we won't have to worry about it. That's
the bottom line. We need to worry about winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did radio interviews and TV interviews and everything's
on (Texas). There was the big problem with the tickets. The
attention went away from the game and where it should be and onto
something else where it shouldn't be. It should have been a
non-issue.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as some of the Angels were concerned, it was a non-issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all grown men,'' Tim Salmon said. ``You're supposed to
be able to deal with those things. You know, we faced a pretty good
pitcher. Arrojo threw a pretty good game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I'm interpreting (what Collins said) is that we didn't
hit well because we were distracted. But he threw a good game.
There's always distractions. It could be anything. You've got to
put those things aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo gave up only one unearned run and four hits in seven
innings, improving to 14-12 and increasing his chances of winning
the AL Rookie of the Year award. It was his third win against the
Angels this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just an excuse to keep everybody's minds off the fact
we were flat,'' Jim Edmonds said of Collins' analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a distraction, I don't think,'' shortstop Gary
DiSarcina said. ``That guy pitched a great game tonight. I tip my
hat to him. We've got some business to take care of with him next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've missed anyone's No.1 (pitcher). And that's
all right. We have to find way to beat those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   While everything went wrong for the Angels on Tuesday, the
Rangers rallied in the ninth inning to beat the Orioles 6-5 and cut
the Angels' AL West lead to one game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Angels really never had a chance in this one with
starter Jeff Juden on the mound. The only thing surprising about
Juden's pitching performance was that Collins gave him the ball in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Juden (1-3) gave up six runs and six hits in five-plus innings
to the lowest scoring team in the majors. He's allowed five runs or
more in four of his six starts for the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Including his last seven starts for Milwaukee before being
traded to the Angels on Aug. 7, Juden is 1-8 with a 8.10 ERA since
July 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having a tough time,'' Juden said. ``I have to keep going
out there every day and keep battling.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said it was too early to decide whether Juden will get
another start for the Angels this year, but it's doubtful he
will. &UR; !dlim!!end! &QL;

   LOS ANGELES -- Outraged by the circumstances of a 7-year-old
girl's slaying in a Nevada casino, the Los Angeles City Council
voted to support expansion of California's ``good Samaritan'' law

   Jeremy Strohmeyer, 19, pleaded guilty last week to killing
Sherrice Iverson, but council members said they also were upset
that David Cash Jr., a friend of Strohmeyer, had witnessed part of
the attack but failed to stop it or tell authorities. Cash has
denied any wrongdoing and was not charged with a crime.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's mother, Yolanda Manuel, attended the council meeting.
``I would like to thank you all for doing what you are doing for
me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas said weaknesses in the current law
could mean Cash cannot be prosecuted. ``Today we are essentially
trying to say we do not wish to fail any more children in the state
of California,'' Ridley-Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution introduced by Ridley-Thomas and adopted
unanimously by the City Council authorizes the city to sponsor and
support legislation to expand the state's good Samaritan law to
more explicitly require action when children are assaulted. A
similar law has been proposed on the federal level.
</P>
<P>
   Naji Ali, a spokesman for the child's family, said Cash's
actions cry out for reform of the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it reprehensible that a 7-year-old child could be
kidnapped, raped, tortured and murdered, and yet there was someone
who witnessed the first part of the kidnapping, David Cash, and
refused to even notify a security guard,'' Ali said.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mike Feuer said the proposed expansion of the law
touches on crucial issues of ethics and morality in society. ``In
our society we owe each other the most simple, basic, humane
respect for life, especially when it comes to our kids,'' Feuer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Richard Alarcon said he was saddened by the whole
incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``How (Cash) could be arrogant and brag about his knowledge of
what went on -- that shows I think the very bottom of moral
thinking in this country,'' Alarcon said. ``We should never
support, condone nor accept the actions of Mr. Cash. Frankly, I
believe he should be in jail. It was wrong.''

EDITORIAL: THE REAL CAMPAIGNS BEGIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Sept. 16:
</P>
<P>
   In winning New York's Democratic nominations for U.S. Senate and
governor on Tuesday, Charles Schumer and Peter Vallone have
accomplished only the easiest part of their political challenges.
Schumer must now go on to compete against Sen. Alfonse D'Amato,
whose skills as a campaigner are legendary. Vallone must take on
the popular Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   We endorsed Schumer and Vallone in the primary because they seem
the Democrats most likely to run strong races this fall. We will
withhold recommendations on the general election until the
appropriate time. Right now, our interest is in seeing a good
campaign in which the incumbents are forced to defend their
records, the challengers to explain how they would do things
better.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone's job appears particularly tough since he comes out of
the primary with little money, and polls show Pataki with high
voter approval. But Vallone should still have plenty to talk about.
The state has a high level of debt, relatively low job growth and
inadequate school systems in many areas. These problems did not
begin with Pataki, and simply pointing them out will not be enough
to draw voters away from him. Vallone will need to challenge the
governor with a credible program for change that differs from the
one Pataki has been pursuing. Vows to simultaneously spend and cut
taxes more will not do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer starts the general race with a few advantages over the
last two Democrats who tried to take on D'Amato. His campaign still
has a considerable amount of money, and despite the pressures of
the primary, he seems to have spent time preparing for the second
stretch of the race. But the going will still be uphill. D'Amato
has much more cash, and Schumer is not well known outside of New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   The senator is likely to go on the offensive quickly and try to
draw an unflattering portrait of Schumer for the upstate and
suburban public. Schumer, meanwhile, has said he intends to dispute
D'Amato's reputation as a man who brings home the bacon for his
constituents. If the challenger runs as strong and well-focused a
race as he did in the primary, and if D'Amato lives up to his
reputation as a killer on the campaign trail, campaign-watchers
should be in for quite a show.
</P>
<P>
   While the candidates debate who can deliver more, there should
also be a long and thoughtful discussion about campaign finance.
Vallone, Schumer and the new Democratic nominee for attorney
general, Eliot Spitzer, should be challenging the incumbent
Republicans hard in this area. Both the state and federal
governments have abysmal controls on how campaign donations are
collected, and that will not change until candidates who return
home to face the voters feel the heat.

 McGWIRE HITS 63rd HOMER IN 8-6 LOSS TO PIRATES  
 (bl)  
 By IRA BERKOW    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Mark McGwire had not hit a home run in six games,
ever since he passed Roger Maris to set the major league
single-season record amid a national furor. And to some, the sky
was falling. A headline in a local newspaper Tuesday read,
``McGwire Stuck at 62.'' To add to the misery of McGwire's fans,
Sammy Sosa, his once and future nemesis and, oddly enough, pal, had
gone during the week from 58 home runs to 62, equaling McGwire's
total.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the problem with McGwire's back; he had suffered
recent spasms. And so Tuesday night, in the first game of a
doubleheader against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Cardinals' manager
Tony La Russa rested McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   But as is the wont of the best-laid plans of rodents and
managers, things changed. And so, abruptly, did the home run race.
McGwire was called on by La Russa to pinch-hit for Delino DeShields
in the ninth inning of the first game, with the Cardinals trailing
by 8-5, one out and no one on base. As the mighty,
right-handed-hitting McGwire stepped to the plate, the crowd of
41,271 at Busch Stadium stood and cheered. They remained on their
feet as McGwire swung at a 1-0 pitch from the left-hander Jason
Christiansen and sent one of his classic, arching blows into the
left-center-field stands, his 63rd home run of the season to break
the tie with Sosa and extend the home run record. The Cardinals
lost the game, 8-6.
</P>
<P>
   When asked after the game how he felt about breaking the record
again, McGwire replied, ``It's not a record until the season is
over.''
</P>
<P>
   On pinch-hitting, McGwire said: ``It's a tough job. You're
sitting around all day, and then you have to get up there and
swing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second game, which the Cardinals won, 9-3, McGwire was 1
for 3 with a double and two walks.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, McGwire said that he was only beginning to
understand what his and Sosa's pursuit of the record had meant to
the country and maybe to the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' he said, standing in front of his locker in
the Cardinals' clubhouse. ``I've seen the editorials and the
front-page stories about what this means to people. Just today I
got a letter from the prime minister of Japan, and from Bob Dole.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire mentioned the ``Stuck on 62'' headline and laughed.
``Imagine. `Stuck' on 62.' I think we've spoiled these people. Last
night I got two singles, and, `Boo, boo!''' It wasn't quite that
way, though fans are disappointed when McGwire does not belt a ball
over the fence. The boos are more for the umpire, when he calls a
strike on McGwire, and for the opposing pitcher, when he throws a
pitch for a ball to McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire and Sosa have put a new face on competition. McGwire,
the son of a Southern California dentist, and Sosa, from an
impoverished background in the Dominican Republic, have been as
close to brotherly love amid these conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have looked at athletes these days as greedy or
arrogant and then they see Sammy and I truly respecting one
another, and liking one another,'' McGwire said. ``Two guys from
two different backgrounds and countries appreciating what the other
is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday night's game, McGwire had only three hits, all
singles, in his last 18 at-bats. He had back spasms Sunday, but he
said his back was now ``outstanding.'' The longest he had gone
without a homer this season was, as he said, ``20-something
at-bats.'' It was in early August, and he recalled telling
reporters, ``There's more important things in the country than
worrying about my hitting a home run.''
</P>
<P>
   About that statement, McGwire said: ``I got kind of testy. But
I'm human. It's a six-month season. And if you average 10 homers a
month, you can break the record. And I had been averaging that. But
I also hadn't yet realized just what all this meant to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Players told McGwire to enjoy the experience, and pointed to
Sosa, who was taking pleasure in it. ``But Sammy wasn't like
Griffey and me,'' McGwire said. ``He hadn't gone through all the
questions before.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire had 58 homers last season and Ken Griffey Jr. had 56;
Sosa had 36. ``So Griffey and I have been getting it since last
year, `Can we break the record?''' McGwire said. But on the weekend
of Aug. 7, the Cubs and Sosa were here for a series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was before a game and Sammy and I looked at each other,''
McGwire said, ``and I guess we both thought, `All right, all the
cameras are around, let's make them happy.'''
</P>
<P>
   They ran at each other and embraced. And then some 10 days
later, in a series between the two teams in Wrigley Field, they did
it again. When McGwire broke Maris' record, it was against the
Cubs, and Sosa ran in from his position in right field to hug
McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   After Sosa hit his 61st and 62nd homers last Sunday, McGwire
called to congratulate him.
</P>
<P>
   A woman called La Russa's office. She had heard that McGwire was
going to play in one of the two games, but didn't know which one.
If it's the first, she told La Russa, she would leave work early.
</P>
<P>
   La Russa had decided to play McGwire in the second game because,
he said, ``more people will be at the second game than the first,
and that would just give more people an opportunity to see Mark.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was asked if he would be disappointed if Sosa finished
ahead of him in homers, thereby establishing the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all, not one iota,'' he said. ``All I can do is control
what I can do. I've done what I've done. However we end up, how can
anybody say anything negative if one is ahead of the other at the
finish?''
</P>
<P>
   And if the two are tied for homers at season's end? ``That,'' he
said, ``would be wonderful.''

SHOWDOWN IN THE WEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ It took some prodding, the same question
being posed in various ways, and Angels manager Terry Collins
finally gave in. Yes, he said, these games against the Texas
Rangers tonight and Thursday are big. Very big.
</P>
<P>
   With a one-game lead and only 12 games to play, the head-to-head
matchups _ including three next week in Anaheim _ could very well
decide the American League West title.
</P>
<P>
   But Collins, he of the one-game-at-a-time mentality, forgot
about the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and their ilk for a few minutes to
recognize what the games against the Rangers mean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, they're more important because you're playing the team
right behind you,'' he said. ``Obviously, they will be the biggest
games we've played. But they can't be approached any differently by
us. There will be no secret meetings. We'll do it as we do before
every series.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins added: ``It still comes down to execution. You can be
sky-high emotionally, but if you don't catch the ball, if you don't
move runners over, if you don't pitch, you're not going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday's 8-1 loss to the Devil Rays, Collins said he
thought all the talk about the Rangers series might have been a
distraction. Angels players say it wasn't, but they're glad to
finally decide it on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough talking about it, let's get it on, let's play,'' Angels
shortstop Gary DiSarcina said. ``As far as I'm concerned, the five
games will decide the division.... May the best team win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have done well against the Rangers this season,
winning three of four in Texas and two of three in Anaheim. They
scored a season-high 18 runs on June 13 in a 12-point victory.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the Texas offense that gets the headlines. The Rangers
lead the American League in hitting with a .289 average. They rank
second in the league behind only the New York Yankees in runs
scored. And they have one of the most feared hitters in the league
in Juan Gonzalez, who leads the majors with 151 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' offensive potency has many players and managers around
the league favoring the Rangers to win the division. The most
recent prediction came from Kansas City manager Tony Muser after
his team had played the Angels and Rangers in back-to-back series.
Muser said he liked the Rangers' chances better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I pick up a sports page, there are managers talking
about how good Texas is,'' Collins said. ``That doesn't bother me.
We still have to play. I know they're a good team. But so are we.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said the underdog role might even be good for his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of ways, it makes it easier to play,'' he said.
``It's why in New York it worked out so well. (The Angels have
fared well against New York this season.) When you play the
Yankees, you're not supposed to win. So you relax and play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are a relaxed team. They haven't seemed adversely
affected by the pressure of a pennant race. Even after being swept
by the Orioles in Baltimore over the weekend, they came to the
ballpark in St. Petersburg loose, many players laughing and
roughhousing with each other before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about this club and the September swan song,''
Collins said. ``Well, I don't know anything about that. There's a
core of guys that were here in '95, but most of the guys don't know
much about history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a feeling it's going to come down to this showdown,''
designated hitter Tim Salmon said. ``We've got two there and three
at our place. This is how it should be.''

RARE REPTILES SEIZED IN ARIZONA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE YOZWIAK  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   An international smuggling ring involving 300 rare and
endangered animals _ including giant Komodo dragons and other
exotic creatures _ has been broken up with arrests in Arizona, San
Francisco and Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests and animal confiscations resulted from an undercover
investigation by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spanning more
than five years.
</P>
<P>
   Among those animals recovered Monday in the Phoenix area were
five white-lipped water monitors from Malaysia and a star tortoise
from India, according to agents of the Fish and Wildlife Service.
Those animals were discovered after a search warrant was served at
a home in the 2200 block of West Keating Avenue in Mesa. The owner
of that house was not accused of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Among those arrested late Monday was Beau Lee Lewis, 20, who
federal authorities allege ran an illegal reptile trade out of his
parent's home in the 13400 block of South Watermann Lane in
Buckeye.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was arraigned in U.S. District Court in Phoenix before
Magistrate Morton Sitver, who ordered Lewis released to the custody
of his parents and ordered not to leave his parents home until
further court hearings take place in U.S. District Court in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials identified him as the owner of Beau Lewis Rare
Reptiles, formerly Southwest Reptile Exchange, through which he
reportedly sold rare animals illegally to customers throughout the
U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Also arrested late Monday were James Michael Burroughs, 47, of
San Francisco, and Keng Liang ``Anson'' Wong, 40, of Penang,
Malaysia, who was taken into custody in Mexico City. Authorities
are looking for a fourth suspect, Yuk Wah ``Oscar'' Shiu, 39, in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Wong is believed to be the kingpin of an international smuggling
operation that plundered reptiles from southeast and central Asia,
New Zealand and Madagascar for sale in the U.S. and other markets,
according to a report by the Fish and Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities said Burroughs worked as a courier for Wong.
</P>
<P>
   The three were named in a 55-count federal indictment unsealed
Tuesday that alleges smuggling, money laundering, conspiracy, false
statement and violating wildlife laws, including the U.S.
Endangered Species Act. They face penalties of up to 20 years in
prison and fines of as much as $500,000 if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment alleges that between January 1996 and Aug. 15,
the defendants illegally smuggled more than 300 animals worth
nearly $500,000 into the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   The animals were transported via human couriers, Federal Express
shipments with false invoices and shipping documents, and concealed
within larger shipments of legal animals, the indictment says.
</P>
<P>
   The internationally protected animals were smuggled from
Malaysia, Hong Kong, Indonesia and the Philippines to the U.S.,
according to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   The smuggling of extremely rare animals, some found only in
extremely limited habitats and near extinction, was denounced by
Jamie Rappaport Clark, director of the Fish and Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sacrificing the world's legally protected rare species to meet
the demand for reptiles prized as exotic live collectibles will not
be tolerated by this country or by our global conservation
partners,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stealing the world's natural treasures takes a toll that
cannot be measured in dollars. It robs countries of their natural
heritage, disrupts ecosystems and shortchanges future
generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the animals illegally traded for upwards of $30,000 each,
were:
</P>
<P>
   Komodo dragon, the world's largest lizard, which grows up to 10
feet long and is found only on Komodo Island and a few neighboring
islands in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Tuatara, a 2-foot-long lizardlike reptile that is the only
surviving member of the taxonomic order ``Sphenodon punctatus.''
All the rest of the members of this animal group died off with the
dinosaurs more than 60 million years ago. It is found on 30 small
islands off the coast of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Ploughshare or angulated tortoise, found only on the island of
Madagascar, off the southeast coast of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Lois Schiffer, assistant attorney general for environment and
natural resources, credited the cooperation of Mexican agents and
Federal Express in assisting in the arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Other agencies involved in the investigation included the U.S.
Customs Service, INTERPOL and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is the world's largest market for wildlife and
wildlife products. Wildlife trade in this country is estimated to
be a $1 billion a year business. &QL;

SOSA HELPS CUBS WIN, BUT FAILS TO HOMER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ED GUZMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The pressure was on the Chicago Cubs and Sammy Sosa
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs had a chance to take the lead on the New York Mets, who
split a doubleheader with the Houston Astros, and Sosa found
himself trailing in the home run chase as Mark McGwire hit No. 63.
</P>
<P>
   But while Sosa did not homer for the second straight game, it
was his single to lead off the seventh inning that helped spark a
four-run rally off starter Kevin Brown that helped the Cubs gain a
4-2 victory over San Diego and gain a half-game lead on the New
York Mets in the wild-card chase. Mark Grace followed Sosa's single
with his career-high 17th home run to give the Cubs a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``My situation is that I got to 62 and I'm happy with that,''
Sosa said.
</P>
<P>
   Refusing to compare himself with McGwire, he said: ``My
situation is different. I have to take the Chicago Cubs to the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's saga continued in front of 37,995 fans at Qualcomm
Stadium. Hitting in the third position on Tuesday night instead of
his customary No. 4 slot, Sosa went 1 for 4 to make him 1 for 8
over the last two nights. Nevertheless, Sosa stepped to the plate
in the first inning to a thunderous standing ovation. It did not
seem to matter that Sosa trailed again in the home run chase. The
crowd remained standing as the umpire received specially marked
balls from the bat boy for Sosa's at-bat. And the crowd remained
standing when Sosa tapped weakly back to Brown.
</P>
<P>
   His next time up, in the fourth inning, Sosa worked the count to
3-1 before hitting Brown's next pitch up the middle, but second
baseman Quilvio Veras backhanded it, pivoted, and threw out Sosa to
end the inning. On the play, part of the handle of Sosa's bat broke
off, forcing him to use a new bat his next time up.
</P>
<P>
   In his last two at-bats, Sosa struck out swinging in the eighth
inning against Brian Boehringer and struck out looking in the ninth
against Scott Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was just as well, because something had been clearly
amiss for Sosa. After catching McGwire at 62 with two home runs on
Sunday, and then giving that bat to the Baseball Hall of Fame, Sosa
had barely even made contact since. He struck out four times
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, but I wish I would have had it last night,''
Sosa said of his old bat before Tuesday night's game. ``When you
feel comfortable with a bat, you feel comfortable in yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Billy Williams, Chicago's dugout coach: ``I think for
Sammy, like other players, it's a superstitious kind of thing. It
made him comfortable for all those home runs, so he didn't want to
give it up.''
</P>
<P>
   But if anyone wondered whether he had a meticulous process with
which he chose his bats, Sosa said: ``I don't have time for that. I
just pick one. It's nothing special.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Sosa is so haphazard about choosing his weapon is
clearly different from McGwire, who keeps his bats specially
wrapped and does not let anyone else touch them. But Sosa's
teammates are none too surprised at his bat-choosing methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy has the same style that we all have about our bats,''
said third baseman Gary Gaetti. ``He uses my bats, Glenallen Hill's
bats, whatever. It doesn't matter to him as long as the bat
works.''
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Tony Gwynn of the Padres, who has 2,915 career
hits, feels the same way.

   ``A bat is a bat,'' Gwynn said. ``All my bats are exactly the
same. This year, every time I get a hit, my owner requests the bat
because I'm going for 3,000 hits. When this year is over, I'm never
giving one again. When you get a good bat, you don't want to give
it up.''  &QL;

FOLKS BACK HOME BEFUDDLED, ANGRY OVER CLINTON SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., was looking for a
consensus from his constituents about President Clinton's troubles
this past weekend, he didn't find it.
</P>
<P>
   What he found instead was ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   ``One guy came up at a cookout and said, `You know what? I don't
care what the president did. I've got a job,' '' said Miller's top
aide, Danny Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people were just scratching their heads wondering
what this thing means. People feel befuddled by this.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress would have had it easier had the weekend
produced a definitive statement from their home districts to guide
them as they decide whether to support Clinton's impeachment or
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   When House members voted Friday to release independent counsel
Kenneth Starr's scathing report about Clinton's reported cover-up
of an affair with Monica Lewinsky, then went home until Tuesday, it
was widely interpreted as a move to elicit voter reaction.
</P>
<P>
   With some exceptions, however, the lawmakers got no mandates.
Rather, they encountered polls and constituents' comments at fairs
and barbecues showing that while Americans are angry with the
president, a majority apparently still don't want to see him
ousted.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the message that lawmakers took back to Washington was
even contradictory.
</P>
<P>
   In The Republic's Arizona Poll, for example, a majority of
respondents, 68 percent, said they believed Clinton lied. Another
majority, 52 percent, said they believe Clinton should be impeached
if it is proved he lied under oath. But an additional majority, 56
percent, also approved of the job Clinton is doing, and only 38
percent said he should resign.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss said that if Republicans didn't get the sort of
anti-Clinton mandate they may have wanted, they should not have
expected to.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, the polls have shown that people don't like
Ken Starr,'' Weiss said. ``Also, there was a calculated level of
risk to giving over a report with that much sex when the public has
very mixed feelings about sex.''
</P>
<P>
   The mixed message was not only given by Arizonans. Around the
country, there were plenty of disparities in the messages members
of Congress claimed to receive.
</P>
<P>
   While the Arizona Poll found residents divided over whether
Clinton should resign, Republican members of the state's
congressional delegation said they had been deluged with
anti-Clinton calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phones are ringing off the hook. I don't know if it's talk
radio (fueling the calls), or what,'' said Mike Parranzino,
communications director for Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   He said the calls _ more than 1,600 Monday and Tuesday _ were
running about 6-1 in favor of Clinton's resigning or being
impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Arizona Reps. Jim Kolbe and J.D. Hayworth, both
Republicans, also were overwhelmingly in favor of Clinton's ouster.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not programmed calls, where the knee-jerk people
read from scripts,'' said Ron Foreman, Kolbe's spokesman. ``This is
a different kind of phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   But a spokeswoman for Rep. Ed Pastor, D-Ariz., the lone Democrat
in the Arizona delegation, cautioned that the calls hardly
constituted a random sample.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a scientific poll,'' said Maura Saavedra, Pastor's
press secretary. ``I told someone that statisticians would cringe
at the way these phone-call results are being reported.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside Arizona, many House members were finding it difficult to
gauge their districts' reactions.
</P>
<P>
   When U.S. Rep. Bob Borski, a Democrat from Philadelphia,
ventured out to a local parade on Saturday, not a single person
approached him to talk about Clinton and Lewinsky, according to the
``Philadelphia Inquirer.''
</P>
<P>
   So Borski, who may have to vote on Clinton's impeachment
someday, started going up to voters to ask about Starr's report.
Several winced at the topic.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at a meeting Monday with about 35 leaders of
senior-citizen groups in his district, Borski asked whether anyone
favored impeachment. Three hands went up.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, Democratic Rep. Tony Hall went to a series of fairs in
his Dayton-area district over the weekend. The large majority of
the people he met there supported the president, said his press
aide, Michael Gessel.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, calls to Hall's office were running
overwhelmingly against the president, with most calling for his
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average American is not giving enough thought to this,''
said Rep. John Shadegg, R-Ariz. He said the public is looking at a
good economy and stable job situation and asking, ``Do we really
have to go through this?''
</P>
<P>
   Shadegg already is convinced that an impeachment inquiry is
necessary. He has read the Starr report and Clinton's deposition in
the Paula Jones sexual-harassment case and determined sufficient
evidence exists to believe Clinton commited perjury, something he
is certain is an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was puzzling over their constituents' responses.
</P>
<P>
   Hayworth put out a release to the media with a screaming
headline reading, ``Switchboard on Fire!!!'' and said the district
had made its ``collective voice'' heard. &QL;

DODGERS MISTAKES SINK PARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The last time Chan Ho Park pitched, he battled
perfection and won. Tuesday night, he faced a much tougher opponent
_ his own teammates _ and lost.
</P>
<P>
   Five days after beating the NL West-champion San Diego Padres
when Kevin Brown retired the first 18 batters, Park had no answer
for three Los Angeles Dodgers errors that led to a 5-3 loss to the
Colorado Rockies in front of an announced crowd of 29,702 at Dodger
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, the Dodgers learned that Eric Young will be
lost for the rest of the season after breaking two bones in his
right foot sliding into second base Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   His replacement, the usually slick-fielding Juan Castro,
committed a throwing error in the third inning that led to two
runs. Eric Karros could not come up with a sharp one-hopper to
first that led to the Rockies' third run. And in the ninth, Bobby
Bonilla waved at Dante Bichette's grounder to third, allowing what
appeared to be an insurance run to score.
</P>
<P>
   But when Dodgers catcher Charles Johnson hit his career-high
19th homer to open the bottom of the ninth off Jerry DiPoto, the
Rockies' third pitcher, Bonilla's blunder turned out to be the
winning run.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had a chance to tie the game when pinch-hitter
Trenidad Hubbard doubled one out after Johnson's homer. Roger
Cedeno, who already had three hits, took Curtis Goodwin to the wall
in center with what would have been a game-winning homer.
</P>
<P>
   But the ball stayed in the park. Hubbard took third, but Jim
Eisenreich lined out to short to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   DiPoto got his 19th save in relief of right-hander Darryl Kile
(12-16), who has dropped just three games in the second half after
a miserable start. Park, who had won his past two starts, fell to
13-9.
</P>
<P>
   Park threw 137 pitches, one more than he had in each of his last
two starts. That makes 409 pitches in his last three outings. But
with the bullpen depleted by injuries, manager Glenn Hoffman said
he was going to let the starters pitch longer if they were doing
well.
</P>
<P>
   Park allowed seven hits, walked four and struck out eight.
Although errors led to three scoring opportunities for the Rockies,
only two of the runs were unearned.
</P>
<P>
   You can't assume a double play on a ground ball, making one of
those runs unearned. The run in the fifth was earned because there
was only one out when Echevarria scored on Karros' error. The
ninth-inning run on Bonilla's error was unearned.
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped the Dodgers closer to mathematical elimination
from the NL wild-card race. They are eight games behind the Chicago
Cubs with 10 games to play. If they lose tonight and the Cubs win,
they will be out.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers jumped on Kile in the first inning, scoring twice on
sacrifice flies by Karros and Raul Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Cedeno, leading off because of Young's injury, opened with
a sharp single to center and took third when Eisenreich singled to
left. But Colorado, which was expected to do much better than its
73-80 record, tied the score in the third. Derrick Gibson, who had
four hits last week in his major-league debut, opened with a
single.
</P>
<P>
   Park then gave up a single to No. 8 hitter Echevarria and walked
Kile. He struck out Curtis Goodwin and appeared to be out of the
inning when Neifi Perez grounded to second. Castro fielded the ball
but threw wildly to second. As the ball rolled into left field,
Gibson and Echevarria scored.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies took the lead in the fifth when Echevarria opened
with a double. One out later, Goodwin singled to center, but
Echevarria stopped at third. He scored when Karros couldn't handle
Perez's sharp one-hopper for an error.
</P>
<P>
   Again the Dodgers tied it, this time in the bottom of the fifth
when Karros doubled to right-center and scored on a sharp single to
right by Bobby Bonilla.

 McGWIRE RECLAIMS HOMER LEAD WITH NO. 63  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Geography dictated that Mark McGwire would lose no
ground to Sammy Sosa Tuesday night, at least for the first part of
the evening. The man himself subsquently ensured that Sosa once
again would be playing catch-up in their fascinating game of
one-upmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Big Mac regained sole possession of the home run lead _ and
record _ by launching No. 63 as a pinch hitter in Game 1 of a
doubleheader against Pittsburgh. His Cubs alter ego, playing in San
Diego, went homerless for the second straight game (1 for 5) after
tying McGwire Sunday. McGwire, back at his customary first base,
went homerless in the nightcap but drove in two runs with a double
and a bases-loaded walk. St. Louis lost the opener, 8-6, but took
the second game, 9-3.
</P>
<P>
   Homer No. 63 ended a weeklong drought for McGwire, who had
managed three hits, all singles, in 18 at-bats since hitting No. 62
Sept. 8. He was a spectator for the first eight innings of Game 1,
a concession to a cranky back and the fact that the Cardinals were
playing two.
</P>
<P>
   But with one out in the ninth and St. Louis trailing, 8-5,
Pittsburgh manager Gene Lamont switched from righthander Mike
Williams to lefty Jason Christiansen. There was no one on base and
the move invited an appearance from McGwire. Cardinals manager Tony
La Russa obliged, and McGwire brought the Busch Stadium crowd to
its feet merely by walking to the on-deck circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been with Tony for too long,'' McGwire said afterward.
``I'm getting ready in the second inning. He told me if they
brought in a lefty to face Delino (DeShields) that I'd hit. I just
work here. I was told to pinch hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Christiansen had surrendered only one homer all year and had a
team-best 2.30 ERA. Opponents were hitting .207 against him. His
first pitch was a ball. The next pitch was low, but McGwire didn't
hesitate, driving it through the night sky into the
left-center-field bleachers. It was his sixth career pinch-hit
homer.
</P>
<P>
   The ball carried 385 feet, a sand wedge by McGwire's standards,
and landed in the glove of 46-year-old John Grass, a St. Louis area
groundskeeper eager to deal. At first, he said he would keep the
ball. Later he said he would ``negotiate'' with McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to get what I think it's worth,'' Grass said. ``I
know I won't get money. But if there are enough things signed by
him, that will be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire didn't seem to care. ``He can keep it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lamont said he was mildly surprised to see McGwire get called
when he brought in Christiansen. McGwire is not seen as your
conventional rally-starter. (He has more home runs than singles.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Tony would (pinch hit McGwire) under normal
circumstances,'' Lamont said. ``I think it was a good move by Tony.
He's trying to help Mark win the home run title.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire said, ``Pinch hitting is tough. You're sitting around,
you haven't done that much, and then you have to go up there. It's
hard. I have a lot of respect for career pinch hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has a lot of respect for the men who are trying to get
him out and offered that they, too, should be recognized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pitched pretty tough,'' he said. ``No one seems to want to
talk about that. On this last road trip, I had two good pitches to
hit. No one seems to want to give the pitchers credit. I see the
best every day. And 70 percent of the time or more, they're going
to get you out.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire said he was a bit amazed by all the ``Stuck on 62''
headlines and stories he'd seen. ``I think you guys are spoiled,''
he said. Asked if he had perhaps let down a bit after hitting No.
62, McGwire said, ``How can you let down after doing something
historical?'' He did own up to being ``in outer space'' the game
after he broke Roger Maris's record.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire had five plate appearances in the nightcap. His closest
shot to No. 64 came when he led off the fifth. He got the green
light on a 3-and-0 pitch but sensed the pitcher, Jose Silva, took a
little off the delivery. ``I skied it,'' he said, describing his
parabola to center. He earlier had doubled to left and flied to
right.
</P>
<P>
   There were walks in the seventh and eighth innings, the latter
coming with the bases loaded. McGwire now has walked a National
League-record 154 times. Babe Ruth has the major league record of
170. Ted Williams holds down second (162) and third place (156).

LEE'S 2-OUT SINGLE LIFTS DIAMONDBACKS IN 11 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Travis Lee's two-out single in the 11th inning gave the
Diamondbacks a 7-6 victory over the San Francisco Giants on Tuesday
night at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Fox hit a leadoff double off Jose Mesa in the 11th. Jay
Bell sacrificed Fox to third and Tony Batista walked before Matt
Williams struck out for the second out. Lee, hitless in his first
five at-bats, then hit a ground ball up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks scored twice in the seventh to pull within 6-4
and pulled even with two in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Robb Nen, the Giants' flame-throwing closer, had
leadoff man Kelly Stinnett in the hole with an 0-2 count, but
Stinnett fought off the next pitch and hit a flare to right field
for a base hit.
</P>
<P>
   Karim Garcia then hit a grounder to second baseman Jeff Kent,
whose toss to second base pulled shortstop Shawon Dunston off the
bag for an error, Garcia reaching first on the fielder's choice.
</P>
<P>
   David Dellucci flied out to center, and Fox made the score 6-5
with an RBI single to center. Nen walked Bell to load the bases,
and Batista tied it with a sacrifice fly to right field.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, a former Giant who had three hits, including his 19th
homer of the season, lined out to short to send the game into extra
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona had a chance to win in the 10th when pinch-hitter Brent
Brede singled with one out and Garcia got a two-out infield hit.
Dellucci then hit a sharp grounder to Bill Mueller at third,
bringing Mueller to his knees. Mueller maintained his composure and
threw to Kent at second to force Garcia for the third out.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants didn't get a hit off Amaury Telemaco in the first
three innings but made up for it in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Leadoff man Marvin Benard hit an opposite-field double just
inside the left-field line. Mueller drove him in with a single to
right-center. Barry Bonds hit an opposite-field ground-rule double
off the foul pole in left. Jeff Kent walked and former University
of Arizona star J.T. Snow hit a two-run single to right.
</P>
<P>
   After Telemaco retired Stan Javier on a pop fly to Jay Bell at
second base for the first out, Shawon Dunston hit the first pitch
from Telemaco for a three-run homer, his third of the season. It
was Telemaco's 54th and final pitch, as Showalter called on
right-hander Clint Sodowsky, who began the season in the bullpen
but had started his previous six games.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks gained a bit of momentum in the fourth when
Batista singled to right with two outs and Williams connected for a
line-drive, two-run, opposite-field homer to right to make it 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Stinnett stroked a one-out single for Arizona in the fifth.
Garcia, the next hitter, had a 3-1 count against Kirk Rueter, but
stood there with the bat on his shoulder and watched two pitches go
over the plate for the strikeout. Pinch-hitter Andy Stankiewicz hit
a grounder to Mueller at third, who forced Stinnett at second for
the third out.
</P>
<P>
   Another opportunity for the Diamondbacks to pull closer
presented itself in the sixth, when Batista singled to center with
two outs and Williams walked, but Lee struck out swinging to end
the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks chased Rueter and reliever Rich Rodriguez in
the seventh and cut the lead to 6-4 as Devon White, slowed by a
sore right calf muscle, came up with a pinch-hit RBI single and Fox
drove in another run with a groundout. &QL;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
About now, Thursday's day off is looking good to the Astros.
<TEXT>
<P>
   After celebrating a second straight National League Central
championship into the wee hours Tuesday morning, the Astros needed
12 innings to pull out a 6-5 victory over the New York Mets in the
first game of a doubleheader at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   The second game didn't go extra innings, but it was just as
tiring _ and more frustrating. John Olerud's three-run homer in the
eighth rallied the Mets to an 8-4 victory and a split of the twin
bill.
</P>
<P>
   In one 28-hour period, the Astros played three games covering 34
innings and made 11 pitching changes in losing two of three games
to the Mets. Jay Powell (7-6) was used twice Tuesday, earning a win
and a loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, who set a franchise record with their 97th victory
of the season in the first game, fell a half-game behind Atlanta in
the race for the NL's best record.
</P>
<P>
   In what seems to be a nasty trend, manager Larry Dierker has
been forced in the last three days to use more of his bullpen than
he cares to. The Astros have blown late leads in their last four
games, losing three of those games. It could have been four losses
if not for Derek Bell's solo home run off Jeff Tam in the 12th
inning of Tuesday's opener.
</P>
<P>
   In identical fashion to Monday's 13-inning series opener (won by
the Mets 7-4), New York rallied from a 4-2 deficit in the ninth on
Carlos Baerga's two-run homer off Scott Elarton. Elarton recovered
and did not allow a run the next two innings, and Powell pitched a
scoreless 12th for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   After using six pitchers Monday, the Astros used three in
Tuesday's opener and five more in the second game. They may be
short on available arms entering today's series finale with the
Mets, but they do have Thursday off before beginning a three-game
weekend series at Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Game 1 starter Shane Reynolds, who received a no-decision in his
bid for victory No. 19, provided the bullpen some relief with a
6-inning effort. Trever Miller, who had not started a game in
nearly two years, pitched four innings in the nightcap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to go deep (in the bullpen) at all,'' Dierker
said. ``I want to get the home-field advantage, but I don't want to
burn up the whole pitching staff in the process. We do have some
off days coming up, which will help a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros may need time to recuperate and mend. If overworked
pitchers weren't a big enough problem, third baseman Bill Spiers
exited in the fifth inning of the opener after reopening the
laceration between the second and third fingers on his right hand.
He is day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   New York took a 2-1 lead in the second inning of Game 1 on Rey
Ordoez's two-run homer off Reynolds. The Astros rallied in the
fourth as Dave Clark led off with a single and advanced to third on
consecutive wild pitches by Mets starter Armando Reynoso. Sean
Berry walked between the wild pitches, and Tony Eusebio cleared the
bases with a two-out double to center field, putting the Astros
ahead 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros added a run in the eighth on a pinch-hit RBI single
by Jeff Bagwell. New York finally got to Elarton in the ninth when
Baerga hit a two-run homer to right on a 2-1 pitch, scoring Lenny
Harris, who had reached one batter earlier on a fielder's choice.
</P>
<P>
   Elarton pitched 4 innings, the longest outing by an Astros
reliever this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Elarton made a very good pitch on Baerga,'' Dierker
said. ``I have no idea how he hit that pitch out of the ballpark,
and he probably doesn't either. Elarton had been throwing nothing
but fastballs. He throws a 2-1 changeup knee-high, and he hits it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, who have specialized in last-gasp comebacks, could
have ended the game in the ninth inning. Tim Bogar doubled to left
field to begin the inning, and rookie Mitch Meluskey followed with
a single to shallow left field. With Jay Payton taking the ball on
one hop in shallow left field, Astros third-base coach Mike Cubbage
gambled and waved Bogar. He was thrown out at the plate, and Craig
Biggio grounded into a double play to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cubby probably made a mistake there,'' Dierker said. ``He came
in (the dugout) and said he shouldn't have done it. Everybody makes
a few mistakes along the way. You can't play this many innings and
do everything perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   New York went ahead 5-4 in the 11th on an RBI double by Ordoez,
who went 3-for-5 and had three RBIs in the first game. This time,
it was the Astros who stormed back, using Bagwell's 33rd homer of
the season off reliever John Franco.
</P>
<P>
   Bell delivered the Astros' 26th victory in their final at-bat
with a homer to lead off the 12th.
</P>
<P>
   Bell was 3-for-5 with two RBIs in the twin bill. The streaking
Bagwell got his average to .300 with a 4-for-6 day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very good team that keeps playing right down to the
end,'' said Mets manager Bobby Valentine of his club, which played
its eighth doubleheader this year. ``They never give up and don't
care what the score is.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't the Astros know it.
</P>
<P>
   In the second game, the Astros led 3-2 after the fifth inning,
only to watch the Mets take the lead for good as Olerud smashed a
three-run homer to right field off Mike Magnante in the top of the
eighth. The Astros pulled within 5-4 in the bottom of the inning,
but that's as close as they would get.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been two tough games,'' said Franco, whose team stands a
half-game behind the Cubs in the NL wild-card race. ``At least
everybody knows we're here. There's something telling us it's
destiny, but it's not going to be easy.''

SOSA AGAIN NO. 2 BUT TRYING HARDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Sammy Sosa is No. 2 again in baseball's home run
derby. But you won't hear any complaints from the Chicago Cubs
slugger because his team is back on the winning track.
</P>
<P>
   Moments before he was to take the field against the San Diego
Padres Tuesday night, Sosa got the news that Mark McGwire had hit
home run No. 63 as a pinch hitter in the first game of a
doubleheader at St. Louis. That broke a tie Sosa had forged at 62
by hitting four home runs over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa didn't catch McGwire Tuesday night, but it didn't matter.
The Cubs won, 4-2, and inched ahead of the New York Mets in the
race for the National League wild card by a half-game. In the ninth
inning, Sosa received the highest compliment a visitor could expect
from the 37,995 fans in Qualcomm Stadium. With two outs and a
runner on first, fans began to chant, ``Walk, walk, walk,'' to
Padres pitcher Randy Myers. Sosa was in the on-deck circle.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, Myers walked Mickey Morandini, bringing up Sosa.
Myers was replaced by righthander Scott Sanders, who struck out
Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   For the night, Sosa went 1 for 5, a single off 18-game winner
Kevin Brown that ignited a four-run rally in the seventh inning.
Sosa's hit was followed by a two-run homer by Mark Grace, his
career-high 17th. For a change, Sosa made only a minor
contribution. His teammates did the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy and I had a rough night on Monday,'' said Grace, ``and
we ended up losing the game. Tonight he was on base for the home
run. And we won, which is the important thing. Every win we get
from here on out is big. A tough loss is big. It's going to be like
that the rest of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa didn't appear crushed by the news that he was trailing
again in the home run race. He has been in this underdog role
before. At one point this season, he trailed McGwire, 24-9. Sosa
actually passed McGwire 48-47, on Aug. 19 _ but his lead lasted
just 6 minutes 12 seconds. McGwire hit two homers the same day to
regain the lead. The next day, he stroked two more.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa caught McGwire again at 55, only to see the Cardinal first
baseman go on a surge that climaxed with his record-setting 62d
blast last Tuesday in St. Louis _ against the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's good that he got to No. 63,'' said Sosa. ``I'm
happy for Mark. Let's see how it goes tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a home run, but I had a better swing. I was more
relaxed tonight. More comfortable at the plate. I can look in the
mirror and tell myself I did much better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did get one base hit and it contributed to winning. My
situation may be a little different, but I'll give to the team all
that I can. For the last 10 games, we'll still be talking about
home runs. But the main thing is that I want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Each player has 10 games left to make his run at the homer
crown. Who has the advantage? Being in the race for a playoff spot
could help Sosa. But the schedule may favor McGwire: The Cardinals
play seven at home, the Cubs only three.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's Tony Gwynn, who knows about late-season pressure,
having flirted with .400 down a stretch or two, thinks the schedule
will play a part.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about playing at home,'' said Gwynn.
``There's a source of energy there. You may recall that when (Sosa)
was playing in St. Louis, it looked like he started to tire or
whatever. But when he got home in Chicago, the crowd just
electrified him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa is looking forward to getting back to Wrigley Field for
three games against the Reds this weekend, the Cubs' final
homestand. Sunday has been declared Sammy Sosa Day in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might have a letdown,'' said Sosa. ``We're all human.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is I got to No. 62 and I caught Mr. McGwire, my
man. I can't stop now. I know I have to go out and compete and do
my job. I did what everybody was waiting for me to do. It's a
pretty heavy responsibility to go out and finish strong and take
the team to the playoffs. Let's see what happens.''

<P>
   Three people claim to own the baseball Sammy Sosa hit for his
62nd home run.
</P>
<P>
   In other news, a Glendale man says he will sell the Hitler diary
he found in his attic.
</P>
<P>
   A 97-year-old Florida woman claims she engaged in an improper
relationship with President Warren G. Harding in the Oval Office,
and has in her possession a pair of bloomers that will prove it.
</P>
<P>
   How about you?
</P>
<P>
   Buying or selling?
</P>
<P>
   What's the going price for fame?
</P>
<P>
   I'll take $500,000 for Sosa's No. 62. I obtained the ball from
an associate who stole it from a collector who reportedly acquired
it from Chicago man known only as ``Vinnie.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's home run race has brought out the best in us, and the
worst.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Mark McGwire hit No. 62. A stadium employee, faithful
as a Labrador, retrieved the piece of history and presented the
ball to the St. Louis slugger. McGwire gave it to the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's 62nd homer is . . .
</P>
<P>
   Where?
</P>
<P>
   It belongs to . . .
</P>
<P>
   Whom?
</P>
<P>
   Is it real, or a fake?
</P>
<P>
   It's baseball's Maltese Falcon.
</P>
<P>
   According to newspaper accounts, Gary ``Moe'' Mullins said he
caught Sosa's home run ball Sunday when it sailed over the Wrigley
Field bleachers and onto Waveland Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Greedy fans jumped him.
</P>
<P>
   Kicked him.
</P>
<P>
   Someone bit his hand.
</P>
<P>
   The ball was ripped away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strong-armed robbery,'' Mullins said.
</P>
<P>
   A teenager later claimed to be the rightful owner. Another man
who wound up with the prize insists ``he'' is.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is now a national story, and attorneys and law
professors are weighing in.
</P>
<P>
   Most legal minds agree that ownership (the state or fact of
being the owner) goes to the first person to possess (to hold or
occupy) abandoned property, i.e., the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rule is the ball is abandoned property when it is hit off
the field, and new title over it is established when seized by the
first taker,'' said Chicago law Professor Richard Epstein.
</P>
<P>
   The first taker being Mr. Mullins, who is so peeved he's
threatening a civil lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The other claimants reportedly have put in calls to Alan
Dershowitz.
</P>
<P>
   Also at issue is authenticity. No one knows whether this ball is
THE ball. And Major League Baseball is to blame.
</P>
<P>
   When McGwire was closing in on No. 62, each baseball put into
play was secretly marked. After Big Mac broke Roger Maris' record,
the identification system was abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, it's impossible to determine whether the ball that
three people claim to be theirs is the real McCoy, as baseballs
look alike.
</P>
<P>
   How would you file a report?
</P>
<P>
   Police: ``What's it look like?''
</P>
<P>
   Fan: ``What do you ``think'' it looks like? It's a ``baseball.''
Round. White. Lot of red stitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Police: ``Any other physical characteristics? Scars? Unusual
markings? How much does it weigh?''
</P>
<P>
   Fan: ``I dunno.''
</P>
<P>
   Police: ``Approximately.''
</P>
<P>
   Fan: ``Five, six ounces maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be difficult to pick Sosa's unmarked home run ball out
of a lineup.
</P>
<P>
   This much is certain. As the season draws to an end, and McGwire
and Sosa conclude the most exciting dinger derby in history _
McGwire hit No. 63 on Tuesday _ the scramble for souvenirs is
becoming frightening.
</P>
<P>
   Did you see the scene on TV when Sosa hit No. 62? It looked like
someone tossed a raw T-bone into a kennel.
</P>
<P>
   When a fan emerged from the dog pile, he tucked the ball under
his shirt and took off. ``There he is. Get him!'' Hundreds gave
chase. It looked like the running of the bulls in Pamplona.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who values his or her well-being more than the potential
dollar value of the ball would treat it like a live grenade, and
get rid of it quickly.
</P>
<P>
   We need to get this season over before someone gets hurt. &QL;

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
IT was late April, the Astros were scuffling along barely above
.500, and Jeff Bagwell couldn't beg or steal a hit, much less
borrow a home run.
</P>
<P>
   A bunch of us huddled around his locker, trying to pry from him
an explanation why his mighty swing was malfunctioning, and the
negative attention had him in a grumpy mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about this stuff right now,'' Bagwell finally
said, balefully staring down his inquisitors, ``but, I promise you,
by the end of the year everything's going to be fine and we'll be
standing here having a happy conversation. Look, I'm not worried.
You shouldn't be, either.''
</P>
<P>
   So here it is mid-September, and the Bag man is contemplating a
lucrative second career because, as a prognosticator, he's batting
a thousand. As a first baseman, his day job, he's batting .300 for
an Astros team that Tuesday night accomplished something none of
its 36 predecessors could.
</P>
<P>
   It won a 97th game.
</P>
<P>
   Guess Bagwell knew something _ both about the guys in his
clubhouse and about himself.
</P>
<P>
   In a season dominated by the MacSammy circus, Bagwell has been
at most a minor character, a bit player on the grand stage baseball
has reclaimed. He's not even in the chase to claim the Astros' Most
Valuable Player designation, much less the National League's. But
the fact he has gone virtually unnoticed and largely unappreciated
elsewhere is why the collectively unsung Astros have quietly turned
themselves into the team to beat in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the Braves, the Padres, the Indians or the Yankees,
either. It's them, as long as they realize what they have become
while the rest of the country has been consumed by the great
home-run race.
</P>
<P>
   And Bagwell, flirting with .500 since September began, is the
conspicuous piece that completes the puzzle, although there's
nothing puzzling about what the Astros have become.
</P>
<P>
   Call them the Bash-tros.
</P>
<P>
   And to think they have Randy Johnson, too. Scary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnson is a carnival,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said last
week, pondering the World Series matchup that worries him the most.
``And I mean that as a compliment. Randy doesn't just dominate,
like a (Roger) Clemens. He forces you to completely change your
lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Astros' lineup, it tends to force people to change
pitchers. With Bagwell back to form, there's no one in either
league who wants any part of the Astros' murderous row. The 3-4-5
hitters _ Derek Bell, Bagwell and Moises Alou _ have 92 home runs
and 334 RBIs among them.
</P>
<P>
   How in heaven's name does anybody pitch to this three-headed
monster night after night?
</P>
<P>
   Especially when the leadoff man, Craig Biggio, is having a
better year than the monster, having become the only Astro to
deliver a 200-hit season. You want an MVP? I'm not slammin' Sammy,
missin' Mac or dissin' Biggio's worthy teammate Alou, but BGO is
the NL's MVP, period.
</P>
<P>
   As for Bagwell, he's just going about his business, keeping his
promise.
</P>
<P>
   Although a Bell dinger brought the historic 6-5 victory to an
abrupt end in the 12th inning of the opener Tuesday, Bell earned
the opportunity only after Bagwell had tried to have the final say.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch hitting in the eighth, he drove home the would-be
insurance run in a would-be 4-2 win. Then, hitting in the 11th _
remember, he wasn't supposed to play until the nightcap of this
rare doubleheader _ he homered for the 33rd time to forge a tie at
5.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth inning of the second game, which the Astros
graciously let the playoff-chasing Mets have 8-4, he also singled
home the tying run. At that point, Bagwell was 4-for-4 on the
double-dip day (he finished 4-for-6). His single in the first got
him to .300, his first visit there all season.
</P>
<P>
   As he had forecast long ago, there has been lots of happy
conversation in the locker room of late. But while happy is
perfectly OK in these giddy times, when you have clinched a second
consecutive division title by winning 36 of 49 games through
summer's dog days, the Astros have to carefully avoid the
temptation of self-satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   For all they've done, they've done nothing yet. This is a
special team with a chance to accomplish something indescribably
special. Imagine what it would mean for them to beat the Yankees in
a World Series that brought an end to what might be baseball's best
season ever.
</P>
<P>
   Really, go ahead and imagine. It could happen.

BAD BACK LIKELY TO KEEP CLEMENT OUT FOR 2 GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
 LINE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anthony Clement started and finished every game during three
years in the trenches in college, remarkable for a man who is 6
feet 7 and 355 pounds _ plenty of target for an injury.
</P>
<P>
   Clement now plays for the Cardinals, for whom some twists of
fate are difficult to explain. The heretofore stranger to the
training room has been beset by injuries since camp. On Tuesday,
the team announced that his sore back is more serious than first
believed.
</P>
<P>
   He will not suit up for the home opener Sunday against
Philadelphia and probably won't make the trip next week to St.
Louis. Clement, the largest player ever drafted by the Cardinals,
was pushing starting right tackle James Dexter.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals medical personnel said Clement underwent a CAT-scan
Tuesday morning and received an epidural injection to reduce pain
in his lower back. Further diagnostics are expected today. Neither
Coach Vince Tobin nor the medical staff was more specific about the
nature of the injury, refusing to say whether it is muscular or
skeletal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get into any of that,'' Tobin said. ``He has a
sore back, and we're hoping to relieve the pain by medication.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Tobin wanted to make changes in his struggling offensive
line _ and he indicated Tuesday that he really doesn't _ his
options now are limited as the Cardinals try to shake two
season-opening routs. Clement, a second-round draft pick from
Southwestern Louisiana, was the strongest candidate to unseat a
starter.
</P>
<P>
   Center Aaron Graham did not dress for the 33-14 loss Sunday in
Seattle after suffering a calf strain in practice Friday. He
remains questionable. Mike Devlin would start in Graham's absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're down to eight offensive linemen, but that's the number
you normally dress anyway,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that two of the remaining eight, backups Jerome
Daniels (knee) and Allen DeGraffenreid (ankle), are coming off
injuries that caused them to miss considerable practice time.
Daniels has been inactive both games. DeGraffenreid saw spot duty
in Seattle after being inactive for the opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their development has been set back,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   The only healthy backup is Matt Joyce, who becomes the third
tackle. He also has experience at guard. DeGraffenreid played
tackle in college, worked at guard with the Cardinals last season
and is listed as the third center.
</P>
<P>
   ``DeGraffenreid can play anywhere along the line,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said the club is not likely to go shopping for a lineman
this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``First we have to find out when Clement is going to be back,''
Tobin said. ``And Graham's injury isn't long term. You can't just
go out and sign a guy anytime you get an injury because then you
have to release somebody else. That's why you have 53 on a roster
and dress only 45. If there's no overabundance of injuries at one
spot, you try to take care of it with the people you've kept.''
</P>
<P>
   Clement complained of back pain during training camp, Tobin
said. Then Clement suffered a strained knee during preseason that
sidelined him for two weeks. His first day back at practice,
Clement aggravated the back injury. He blamed it on a bulky knee
brace, saying he couldn't move comfortably. He believes he torqued
his back trying to compensate for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had gradually gotten better,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   After sitting out the season opener, Clement played briefly
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' Clement said. ``I was never hurt in
college, never. I'm not going to make a push for a starting job
sitting in the training room.''
</P>
<P>
   Clement had no history of back problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing in medical evaluations from the scouting
combine in Indianapolis to indicate any problems,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   The line is foremost among many problems for the Cardinals, who
have scored 10 and 14 points with an offense ranked 28th in the NFL
this week. &QL;

CONTRACT BRIDGE CRUMBLES  
 SIDES AGREE ON LITTLE EXCEPT TKACHUK IS UNDERPAID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Believe it or not, Bobby Smith and Bob Murray agree upon a
couple of things regarding Coyotes captain Keith Tkachuk.
</P>
<P>
   They believe he's one of the NHL's top 10 players.
</P>
<P>
   They also believe he's vastly underpaid at $2.8 million this
season. But that's about where the mutual understanding ends
between Smith, Coyotes general manager, and Murray, agent for the
holdout Tkachuk.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he were a Group II free agent, we would be willing to pay
him more than $2.8 million this year. There's no question about
that,'' Smith said. ``But the issue is not how good Keith is
compared to (Jaromir) Jagr or Doug Weight or (Teemu) Selanne or
anybody. The issue is, this guy's got two years left on his
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ````The Hockey News'' ranks him the 10th-best player in the
league. Where is he? Is he third? Is he seventh? Is he 14th? I
don't know. That is not the issue. Keith Tkachuk's a great player.
. . . Surprisingly, the disagreement has not been slotting Keith
into the league's hierarchy. The issue has been, he's still got two
years left on his contract.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time he signed his five-year deal, an offer sheet from
the Chicago Blackhawks that the Winnipeg Jets matched, Tkachuk was
of of the five highest-paid players in the league. The first year
alone, he earned $6 million. The remaining four years were for
substantially lower pay _ $2.6 million, $2.8 million, $2.8 million
this season and $3 million in 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
   It guaranteed him financial security, but by locking himself in
for such a long period, he has been unable to reap the benefits of
a skyrocketing NHL marketplace, which now has seen 11 players make
$6 million or more on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 players are being paid more than Tkachuk this
season. All of them, according to figures obtained by agents, will
make at least $4 million. That's at least $1.2 million a year more
than the Coyotes' best player.
</P>
<P>
   Five players are making $8 million or more _ Detroit's Sergei
Fedorov ($14.5 million), Philadelphia's Eric Lindros and Anaheim's
Paul Kariya ($8.5 million each) and Vancouver's Pavel Bure and
Buffalo's Dominik Hasek ($8 million each). Several others have
deals that will pay them that much and more within the next one to
three years, including Anaheim's Selanne, a former Jets forward,
whose contract escalates to $8.9 million and $9.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Modano of Dallas and the Penguins' Jagr recently signed
deals that will put them well above the $8 million mark. Tkachuk,
the third-highest goal scorer in the league the past five seasons,
wants _ and expects _ to be placed in that company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make any sense to get locked in again to another
long-term deal when everyone knows salaries are going to keep going
up,'' one NHL agent said. ``Just look at Jeremy Roenick and Teemu
Selanne. Heck, those guys are in Tkachuk's own back yard. He should
know better than anybody that those two guys had to bite the bullet
the last couple years of their deals when everybody else was
starting to make a ton of more money.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray concedes that the NHL salary bar almost certainly will
rise to substantial heights during each of the next five seasons
when Tkachuk, if he gets an extension, would be locked up by the
Coyotes. In fact, he cites a study he claims both the players
association and the NHL stand by that shows the average NHL salary
has risen an average of 23.4 percent every year for the past seven
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just not a two-year thing caused by a couple big
contracts like the (Joe) Sakic or Fedorov deals, where the numbers
get skewed,'' Murray said. ``This is a seven-year average. Even if
it only goes up half of that, that's still an 11 percent to 12
percent increase, and that's 55 percent in five years.''
</P>
<P>
   So why, then, doesn't Tkachuk simply honor the final two years
of his deal and rub his palms in anticipation of striking a
mega-rich offer sheet when he becomes a Group II free agent? Who's
to say that a team such as the New York Rangers or the Blackhawks
or even an expansion team such as Atlanta wouldn't pony up with a
$50 million offer?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tempting, but there are a few reasons why Keith is
willing to commit to a five-year deal with Phoenix,'' Murray said.
``For one, there's financial security to it. Two, he really likes
playing there, and he wants to stay there for a long time. And
three, the Coyotes know they won't be able to match an offer sheet
that big, so they'd end up trading him before his second year is
up, anyway. He doesn't want that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, all negotiations are off, Smith said. Tkachuk,
meanwhile, won't even make his full $2.8 million when or if he
reports. After four days of his holdout, he already has lost
$40,724 due to suspension. &QL;

DODGERS ERRORS COST PARK
</HEADLINE>
 (writethrough) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The problem isn't just the enormous number of
pitches Chan Ho Park is throwing at the end of the year. It's that
Park won't stop playing in 10 days like the rest of his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   A month after this miserable Dodgers season ends, Park will be
heading to Japan for an eight-game All-Star series. In December, he
will represent his native Korea in the Asian Games in Bankok,
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   A gold medal there will make Park, 25, exempt from mandatory
military service, an issue that has been hovering over his Los
Angeles Dodgers career since he joined the club four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   So when Park threw 137 pitches Tuesday in a 5-4 loss to the
Colorado Rockies in front of an announced crowd of 29,702 at Dodger
Stadium, there was a lot more at stake than just another
meaningless game on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers already have had five pitchers miss playing time
this season with sore arms, including No.1 starter Ramon Martinez,
who was lost for the year with a torn rotator cuff. Park, who threw
136 pitches in each of his previous two starts, said he doesn't
mind. He said the first game, when he went the distance in a Sept.
5 victory over San Francisco, was pretty taxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm fine,'' said Park, who has thrown 409 pitches in his
last three starts. ``I'm trying to make fewer mistakes, trying to
walk fewer batters. That would help.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the mistakes belonged to his teammates, and they cost
him the game. It also dropped the Dodgers closer to mathematical
elimination from the National League wild-card race. They are eight
games behind the Chicago Cubs with 10 games to play. If they lose
tonight and the Cubs win, they will be out.
</P>
<P>
   On the day, the Dodgers learned that Eric Young will be lost for
the rest of the season after breaking two bones in his right foot,
his replacement, the usually slick-fielding Juan Castro, committed
a throwing error in the third inning that led to two runs.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros could not come up with a sharp one-hopper in the
fifth that led to the Rockies' third run. And in the ninth, Bobby
Bonilla waved at Dante Bichette's grounder to third, allowing what
appeared to be an insurance run to score.
</P>
<P>
   But when Dodgers catcher Charles Johnson hit his career-high
19th homer to open the bottom of the ninth off Jerry DiPoto, the
Rockies' third pitcher, Bonilla's blunder turned out to be the
winning run.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had a chance to tie the game when pinch-hitter
Trenidad Hubbard doubled one out after Johnson's homer. Roger
Cedeno, who already had three hits, took Curtis Goodwin to the wall
in center with what would have been a game-winning homer.
</P>
<P>
   The ball stayed in the park. Hubbard took third, but Jim
Eisenreich lined out to short to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   DiPoto got his 19th save in relief of right-hander Darryl Kile
(12-16), who has dropped just three games in the second half after
a miserable start. Park, who had won his past two starts, fell to
13-9.
</P>
<P>
   But with the bullpen depleted by injuries, manager Glenn Hoffman
said he was going to let the starters pitch longer if they were
still doing well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's a ridiculous number for him,'' pitching
coach Charlie Hough said. ``He's a strong young man. I didn't want
him to throw that many tonight, but it just worked out that way. He
was throwing good, even in the last inning. I think he can learn to
cut down the amount of pitches in a ballgame. He can pitch nine
innings on more like 120 pitches. But that's not a huge number.''
</P>
<P>
   Park allowed seven hits, walked four and struck out eight.
Although errors led to three scoring opportunities for the Rockies
only two of the runs were unearned.
</P>
<P>
   You can't assume a double play on a ground ball, making one of
those runs unearned. The run in the fifth was earned because there
was only one out when Angel Echevarria scored on Karros' error. The
ninth inning run on Bonilla's error was unearned.
</P>
<P>
   All that will be forgotten when Park heads off to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Park, who spends much of the winter in his native Korea, flies
to Orlando, Fla., on Oct. 27 for a two-day workout. He then heads
to Japan for the opening game against the world famous Yomiuri
Giants. Park will earn $83,000.

DEALING WITH DANGER  
 FEAR OF FAILURE STRONGER THAN FEAR OF FAST BALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   So there's nothing to fear but fear itself, huh?
</P>
<P>
   How about stepping into the batter's box and having a fastball
hiss near your head at between 90 and 100 miles per hour?
</P>
<P>
   Or following through on a pitch near the front of the mound and
having the ball come back at you seemingly twice as fast?
</P>
<P>
   Or coming across second base and having a runner bearing down on
you in an attempt to break up a double play?
</P>
<P>
   Or moving back on a fly ball in the outfield, turning your head
to locate and catch it, then turning back and putting an imprint of
your face on the wall?
</P>
<P>
   These are some of the dangers faced by baseball players every
day. Yet they all agree on one thing: If you are going to be
successful, you have to put that fear out of your mind. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Wagner's recovery &QL; 
 &QL; 
When the Houston Astros visited Bank One Ballpark on July 15, a
line drive by Arizona catcher Kelly Stinnett ricocheted off the
left side of Houston reliever Billy Wagner's head.
</P>
<P>
   Paramedics stabilized Wagner and took him to the Barrow
Neurological Institute at St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center
in Phoenix. He did not lose consciousness but suffered a concussion
and a cut of his inner ear. After being admitted for observation,
he was released about 18 hours later.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very lucky,'' said Barrow neurologist Curtis Dickman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a scary thing,'' recalled Diamondbacks pitcher Brian
Anderson. ``I was standing near the top step of our dugout, and the
ball rolled close to us after it hit him. I wanted to throw up.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner went on the disabled list, then was activated Aug. 6
after a couple of rehabilitation outings in the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   When he did return, Wagner said he was more concerned how his
arm would feel after the inactivity than whether he would be hit
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't bother me because you don't have time to think
about things like that when you're on the mound,'' Wagner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My arm strength wasn't going to be there, my velocity wasn't
going to be what it was, and my control was not going to be what it
was. But I was sick of seeing the games from a distance and not
being able to participate, and I was sick of not being dressed and
ready to play.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Pitchers are vulnerable &QL; 
 &QL; 
Former Diamondbacks right-hander Willie Blair, traded to the New
York Mets on July 31, was hit in the jaw by a line drive while
pitching for the Detroit Tigers in 1997. Blair was out for about a
month and existed for the most part on a liquid diet as his jaw
healed.
</P>
<P>
   Observers estimated that the ball came off the bat of
Cleveland's Julio Franco at about 107 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared,'' Blair said. ``I was afraid for my life for a
few minutes. But then I realized I was going to be OK. It made me
realize how quickly things can change, and I worked harder than I
had ever worked to get back.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair did change his follow-through because of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I followed through before, I sort of fell off the side of
the mound and was a little off-balance,'' he said. ``Then I learned
to land more square, straight ahead. I think it made me more
consistent and have more control.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who said he has never been hit but has been ``buzzed''
a few times by line drives, said the odds in the pitchers' favor
are decreasing because of physics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take nothing away from the guys who played in the early days,
like Babe Ruth and others, but the players today are getting better
teaching and more teaching about the art of hitting,'' he said.
``They're also in better condition. They're bigger, stronger and
faster.''
</P>
<P>
   The hitters also seem to have more protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like they have all this body armor,'' Anderson said.
``You can't throw in on them or you get tossed (by the umpire) or
charged (by the player). The pitchers should have their share of
the plate, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks right-hander Andy Benes was with St. Louis in 1997
and saw Blair get hit on TV, and he was alongside Anderson and saw
Wagner get hit up close.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just something you put out of your mind,'' Benes said.
``You can't go out there thinking about it, or you can't be
effective.''
</P>
<P>
   `You can't have fear' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Before he came to the Diamondbacks from the Mets as part of the
deal for Blair, outfielder Bernard Gilkey was hit in the head by a
pitch from Florida's Ryan Dempster in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a scary moment, but you can't let it bother you for
very long,'' Gilkey said. ``In my first at-bat after that, I hit a
line drive. You have to try to get back in there and be
comfortable. It can be a tough thing to do, but you have to do it.
You can't have fear of that, and you can't have fear of anything in
this game, period.''
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee Brewers Manager Phil Garner has been around the game a
long time. He's seen a lot of serious beanings, including Matt
Mieske getting hit by Seattle's Randy Johnson and Mike Matheny get
hit in the cheek.
</P>
<P>
   Garner, an infielder during his playing days, said he was hit in
the head during spring games by John D'Acquisto and John
Montefusco.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the times, I wobbled down to first. I just wasn't going
to come out, but Chuck Tanner (Pirates manager) made me,'' Garner
said. ``You have to try to come back as quick as you can. You can't
be a sound hitter if you have fear.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Whatever it takes &QL; 
 &QL; 
Brewers second baseman Fernando Vina, a former player at Arizona
State, suffered a broken leg when sliding into second base on April
19, 1997, and was out approximately eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was scared at first, ``but only going out there and
playing again takes it out of your mind. Once you do it over and
over, it gets better.''
</P>
<P>
   He said trying to turn the double play also can lead to its
share of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the guy (base runner) is going to be coming after
you. You just have to try to get up in the air and put your body in
a position where you're going to take as little of the hardest
contact as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks' Andy Fox hasn't pitched this season, but he
has done just about everything else, starting at three of the four
infield positions and in all three outfield spots.
</P>
<P>
   He agreed with Vina on the double-play scenario, and as far as
hitting the wall in the outfield, ``That's a chance you have to
take if you want to get the ball. Most ballparks are good about the
warning track, although you're never 100 percent sure. I like our
park because you have grass, then the track, then more grass. When
you hit that second bit of grass, you know the fence is going to be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   When he steps into the batter's box, Fox is aware of the
possibility that he will be hit. Entering Wednesday's game,
possibility had become reality 14 times this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to get on base any way you can, but you have to erase
(getting hit) from your memory, otherwise, you can't be
productive,'' he said. &QL;

KEY TO PRESIDENT'S FATE WEIGHS HEAVILY ON BAY AREA REPRESENTATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   By LOUIS FREEDBERG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As a first-year law student nearly a
quarter-century ago, Zoe Lofgren helped draft one of the articles
of impeachment against Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is an eerie, if not weary, sense of deja vu as she
prepares for the possibility of having to undertake the same task
against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   No longer a lowly aide, the San Jose Democrat is now a member of
the House Judiciary Committee, which could well determine Clinton's
fate. She is the only Northern California lawmaker on the
committee, which 24 years ago projected the likes of Barbara Jordan
and Trent Lott to national fame in the Watergate hearings.
</P>
<P>
   While off-color jokes about the president's predicament permeate
private conversations and the public airwaves, the 50-year-old
Lofgren is approaching her task with the earnestness of a graduate
student preparing to defend her doctoral dissertation.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, she left her husband and two teenage children
behind in California and immersed herself in the Federalist Papers,
read portions of a classic 1913 text on ``The Framing of the
Constitution'' and reviewed the 1974 Watergate committee's report
on the history of the impeachment statute.
</P>
<P>
   The first and most important task before the committee, Lofgren
says, is to determine whether the charges against Clinton meet the
standards for ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' established by the
Founding Fathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question that faces us is whether these allegations rise
to the level of posing a threat to our constitutional form of
government, as was the case in Watergate,'' she said in an
interview in her Capitol Hill office. ``If the answer to that is
no, then you save the country the effort of going through this
agonizing process.''
</P>
<P>
   Lofgren came to Washington in 1994, the year Republicans took
back control of Congress. Since then she has labored in relative
obscurity _ a not-untypical position for a junior member of the
minority party.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to her position on the judiciary panel, she has been
catapulted into the media spotlight, appearing on the major
networks, CNN and the BBC, and being quoted extensively in news
magazines and national newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   As a personal matter, she says she is ``very disapproving, very
unhappy'' with Clinton's conduct. ``He had this girlfriend, he
misled everybody, his wife, everyone, and I don't approve of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But unlike many of her colleagues, she has refused to attack
independent counsel Kenneth Starr, or to suggest whether or when
there should be impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   If the panel does hold hearings, it could end up drafting and
voting on articles of impeachment against the president. If
approved by the full House, the articles would be forwarded to the
Senate, which would conduct a trial on the charges. To force the
president out of office, a two-thirds vote in the Senate would be
required.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Lofgren is insisting that the committee follow the same
procedure it did in 1974. ``It was a horrible time for the country,
but everyone felt the committee had discharged its constitutional
duties very well,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, committee Chairman Peter Rodino commissioned an
extraordinarily detailed review of the history of the impeachment
statute, which it issued in February 1974, a full six months before
Nixon resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Lofgren is now handing out copies of the 1974 report to any
colleague who requests it. &UR;  &LR; What is at stake, she says, is
preserving an essentially American form of government, and
preventing it from being transformed into a British parliamentary
system. In the British system, a prime minister can be removed by a
simple vote of no confidence for virtually any reason.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, she said, the Founding Fathers believed that the
president should be removed from office only if he engages in
behavior that threatens the U.S. system of government. Benjamin
Franklin, she said, viewed impeachment as ``favorable to the
executive'' because without it the only other alternative would be
assassination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was that if the activity was so great that it would
destroy the government, you had to have the ability to remove a
president,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When Lofgren came to Washington, she sought a position on the
Judiciary Committee in part to promote the intellectual property
issues of interest to her Silicon Valley constituency, such as
copyright and patent legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, her colleagues say, her temperament will be ideally suited
for a task that has only been seriously undertaken twice in U.S.
history _ against Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Nixon in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is and will continue to be an eminently fair person,''
said Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif. ``She does not have a need, as so
many others around here, to shoot from the hip. She is very
thoughtful, possesses a trained and considerable intellect, and has
a broad appreciation of the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Eshoo pointed out that Lofgren had the best possible role model
_ longtime San Jose Rep. Don Edwards, a staunch civil libertarian
who resigned in 1994 after 32 years in Congress. Lofgren was his
aide for many years before becoming a Santa Clara County
supervisor. When Edwards retired, she ran for and was elected to
his vacant seat.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1974, when Lofgren was a first-year law student
at the University of Santa Clara, Edwards asked her to come to
Washington to fill in for lawyers on the committee who had been
called away to work on the Watergate hearings. ``The original idea
was that I would backfill and do work on a bankruptcy bill,'' she
recalls. ``That lasted about a week.''
</P>
<P>
   She soon found herself helping Edwards draft one of the three
impeachment articles. ``I don't want to overplay my role,'' she
says. `'But I was here, I was present, and I was able to observe.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she has supported most of Clinton's policies,
especially those on education, she believes she will be a fair
member of the committee. She points out that she has had
disagreements with the president _ for example, over the
administration's insistence on law enforcement access to encrypted
codes intended to safeguard computerized communications. She also
notes that she supported former Massachusetts Sen. Paul Tsongas in
the 1992 presidential campaign when Clinton first ran.
</P>
<P>
   But as Washington waits for possibly even more salacious
revelations about Clinton's Oval Office behavior, she says she
feels the weight of history bearing down on her. ``Impeachment is
the undoing of the popular will of the American people,'' she said.
``It's saying `I know more than the American people and I am going
to undo their election.' ''

S.F. CONFERENCE PUTS EMPHASIS ON DIABETES AWARENESS, TREATMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARL T. HALL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Family physicians began a yearlong campaign
Tuesday to improve detection and early treatment of diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Family Physicians made diabetes the
clinical focus of its annual meeting, which starts Wednesday in San
Francisco and continues through the weekend. About 7,000 physicians
and 13,000 others are registered for the event.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Neil Brooks, a Connecticut physician and president of the
85,000-member group, noted that complications are found in roughly
half of the 800,000 cases diagnosed each year.
</P>
<P>
   That's a sign that many people with the disease are ignoring
early signs, which may include extreme thirst, frequent urination,
blurred vision and unexplained weight loss. Transitory diabetes
arising during pregnancy often signals a chance that the disease
will recur later in life. People who are overweight and sedentary
also are at higher risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of diseases are considered `sexy' and get a lot of
attention, but not this one,'' Brooks said. ``Sometimes things like
diabetes become so prevalent, we put it in the background and
forget about it.''
</P>
<P>
   About 16 million people in the United States are believed to
have diabetes, but about 5 million of those are undiagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   It's a chronic, incurable disease that can show up at birth or
develop during adulthood. The prevalence of the latter variety,
known as Type II diabetes, is expected to increase as the
population ages.
</P>
<P>
   The disease is marked by the inability to make or properly use
insulin, a vital hormone needed in metabolizing sugar. Diabetics
typically must closely monitor blood glucose levels and take
frequent injections of insulin if changes in diet and exercise fail
to keep symptoms under control.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term complications can include blindness, damage to the
circulatory system and amputations. Diabetes claims about 187,000
lives a year, making the disease and its complications the
seventh-leading cause of death in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan outlined Tuesday includes courses for family
doctors on how to better manage and diagnose the condition. More
physician training and public-education efforts are planned
throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   Medical-device makers, meanwhile, hope to weigh in eventually
with easier methods for diabetics to monitor their blood sugar
levels and to take insulin.
</P>
<P>
   Cygnus Inc., for example, a Redwood City company, said it has
initiated clinical tests of its ``GlucoWatch'' monitor, a wrist
device designed to offer a painless alternative to frequent finger
punctures. But the watch has suffered delays in development,
there's no firm timetable for seeking regulatory approval and the
company is still looking for a marketing partner.
</P>
<P>
   Another Bay Area firm, Inhale Therapeutic Systems in San Carlos,
has joined with New York-based drugmaker Pfizer Inc. to develop an
inhaled form of insulin.
</P>
<P>
   Limited patient trials suggest that inhalers could replace
injections for many patients, but those results have yet to be
borne out in pivotal trials. The inhalers are at best several years
away from reaching the commercial market.
</P>
<P>
   Cures, such as transplants or cell therapies, are not in sight.
While more research could speed progress, diabetes experts said the
best hope for now is simply to get more patients treated sooner
with the existing options.
</P>
<P>
   Possibilities include an array of drugs that can improve the
body's ability to handle insulin. ``We have the tools,'' said
Richard Kahn, chief scientific officer for the American Diabetes
Association. ``What we need is for patients and physicians to take
diabetes seriously.''

STING CAPTURES `FLAGRANT' SMUGGLER OF ENDANGERED REPTILES 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL WALLACE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A federal grand jury has indicted four members
of an international smuggling ring that trafficked in rare and
endangered reptiles, including such exotic species as the Komodo
dragon.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the suspects, including a San Francisco man, have
already been arrested, and federal agents were seeking the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests were the result of a complicated five-year sting
investigation called ``Operation Chameleon.'' The probe was
structured around a phony San Francisco company, PacRim
Enterprises, that purported to deal in imported animals but
actually was staffed by undercover agents of the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
   The ring is charged with smuggling more than 300 animals worth
an estimated $500,000 from Asia into the United States. Interpol
estimates illegal wildlife trafficking worldwide at $6 billion
annually.
</P>
<P>
   An 82-page indictment charges a 40-year-old Malaysian man, Ken
Liang ``Anson'' Wong, with being the leader of the ring. James
Michael Burroughs, a 47-year-old San Francisco resident, is charged
with being a key member of the group directly involved with the
smuggling of rare and endangered animals.
</P>
<P>
   Reptiles smuggled by members of the ring could be sold on the
black market for prices ranging from $900 for three Bengal monitor
lizards to $20,000 each for Komodo dragons, the world's largest
living lizard.
</P>
<P>
   In one shipment, the ring allegedly brought in 48 Chinese
crocodile lizards worth a total of approximately $36,000.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the arrest, Attorney General Janet Reno hailed the
cooperation of the Justice Department, the Mexican attorney
general's office, the U.S. Customs and Fish and Wildlife services,
Interpol and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trafficking in endangered species threatens our environment,''
Reno said. ``Let the message be clear: We will take whatever steps
are necessary here and abroad to stop the black market in
endangered species.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, filed under seal last week and made
public Tuesday, agents assigned to the probe had extensive business
contacts with Wong and the other members of the ring and were able
to follow the illegal movements of rare animals into the United
States as well as trace the reverse flow of revenue to Wong.
</P>
<P>
   They also obtained evidence that the conspirators were
falsifying federal import forms that are filed under penalty of
perjury in order to cover up their illegal smuggling operations.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment details a series of separate smuggling operations
involving Burroughs and Beau Lee Lewis, a 20-year-old Arizona man,
who were allegedly paid for illegally importing the endangered
reptiles into this country.
</P>
<P>
   At the culmination of Operation Chameleon, Wong was arrested
Monday during a trip to Mexico City in which he was supposed to
meet with a federal agent posing as a crooked businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, agents in the United States collared Burroughs and
Lewis. The latter is charged with helping smuggle rare animals as a
part of the ring.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth suspect, Hong Kong animal dealer Yuk Wah Shiu, 39,
remained at large.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Webb said Wong will be extradited
from Mexico for trial in the U.S. as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Burroughs appeared briefly in U.S. District Court in San
Francisco Tuesday, but he did not enter a plea to the charges. He
will appear in court Friday for a bail hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents said Burroughs was directly involved with
smuggling such endangered animals as star tortoises, crocodiles
from India, Chinese alligators and Komodo dragons into the United
States on behalf of Wong's group.
</P>
<P>
   Burroughs continued to move the rare animals into the country as
recently as last month, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charges the three men with 55 violations of
federal law, including conspiracy, smuggling, money laundering,
falsification of federal statements and breaking wildlife laws.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, the suspects could face up to five years in
federal prison for each of the smuggling, conspiracy and false
statement charges. The money-laundering charges Wong faces could
bring a 20-year maximum prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest was hailed by the World Wildlife Federation, an
organization involved in efforts to save endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Hoover of the federation's trade monitoring program,
praising the international effort, said the financial rewards of
illegal animal smuggling are so great that it is difficult for any
one nation to cut off the trade.
</P>
<P>
   Wong, who is described by law enforcement officials as a major
international dealer in endangered reptiles, was indicted in an
unrelated smuggling operation in Florida in 1992, but he has evaded
arrest for the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Agents said he used many of the same techniques in the Florida
operation that were found in the Northern California case.

 &HT;    Travel story on British Columnbia

<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER AND VICTORIA, British Columbia _ Canada. Such
impeccable manners. Even the drunks up here in the southwestern tip
of Canada are polite.
</P>
<P>
   On a Saturday night in early August, my wife Sally and I watched
a bombastic fireworks display in Vancouver called the Benson &AMP;
Hedges Symphony of Fire, the largest offshore musical fireworks
competition in the world. If these dudes had it, they blew it up.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of people lined the shores of English Bay
in downtown Vancouver to watch the show. Midway through, a guy,
about 20 years old and approximately half-cocked, OK, maybe
two-thirds cocked, climbed up on a wall in front of us and many
other people, limiting our views and chapping our heinies.
</P>
<P>
   Get down -- you're in the way,'' several people told the guy.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry,'' the guy said, with a British inflection, climbing down
from the wall and stumbling off into the night.
</P>
<P>
   None of your generic American Hey, buzz off, bozo.'' No
single-finger finale. Just plain old, Sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   During late July and early August, Sally and I spent three
nights in Vancouver, and two nights in Victoria, on Vancouver
Island, which is an hour-and-a-half ferry ride from Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   The only unkind words we heard during our whole trip were from
an old lady who was ragging on her husband on the ferry from
Seattle to Victoria, aboard the Princess Marguerite III.
</P>
<P>
   It was a four-hour trip, with majestic island scenery passing
by. She rode his butt the whole way, as he tried to ignore her in
the ferry lounge by burying his head in a golf magazine and
consuming a steady supply of mixed drinks.
</P>
<P>
   You sit there reading the newspaper, and from 6 to 8 I run my
rear end off, and you forget to bring the Camcorder,'' the woman
complained.
</P>
<P>
   British Columbia. Land of lots of flowers. Flowers on the
sidewalks in shops. Flowers in yards. There aren't enough meadow
muffins in Texas to grow all of the flowers you'll find in this
part of the world. They probably grow flowers at the dump up here.
</P>
<P>
   And where's the litter? The countryside is so clean and tidy
that in some of the parks you'll run across dispensers for plastic
dog poop bags.
</P>
<P>
   I'm croaking if I'm joking. In Victoria, British Columbia's
provincial capital, they had dog poop bags available for dog
walkers at the Gorge Waterway park across the street from our
motel.
</P>
<P>
   Dog owners are required to remove excrement left by their dogs,'
' the sign states. Nearby, fat, tame Canada geese sat at the water'
s edge. I was surprised nobody had rigged diapers to their rear
ends.
</P>
<P>
   British Columbia, the kind of place where you could make
roadside trash'' an item on a scavenger hunt, and the participants
would play hell finding it.
</P>
<P>
   And soooo civilized. In Victoria, a city that many say is more
British than Britain, you can rummage through woolen shops, eat
fish and chips, ride on a red double-decker bus, or attend high tea
at the stately Empress Hotel, where you can nibble watercress
sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   Being more familiar with the South Austin tradition of 'Hi,
beer, '' we eschewed that tradition and went, instead, to Ferris'
Oyster Bar &AMP; Grill, kind of a grunge oyster joint in Victoria's
Olde Towne (notice the extra e's here) where for $20 from noon to 4
p.m. on Sundays you can eat all the oysters you can stand.
</P>
<P>
   So long as supplies last,'' says Tom Ferris, the proprietor.
</P>
<P>
   If we got 'em, we shuck 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   The record, Ferris said, is 16 or 17 dozen, set by a big boy''
bartender who works at Steamers, a nearby music club.
</P>
<P>
   I'd hate to be his girlfriend,'' Ferris says. The place also has
wonderful sweet potato french fries.
</P>
<P>
   So it's not all stuffy up here, as can also be proven by the
Cannabis Cafe, a vegetarian restaurant in Vancouver, where you can
smoke 'em if you got 'em.
</P>
<P>
   They don't have pot on the menu, but they'll let you partake in
the restaurant if you bring your own. (You could say it's BYOP.) A
sign by the hostess stand tells guests marijuana is illegal in
Canada, and
</P>
<P>
   If you choose to consume in this cafe you do so at your own
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Icee, who runs the restaurant and the adjoining hemp
products/head shop, says plenty of people take advantage of the
offer over their jumbo veggie dogs and pizzas.
</P>
<P>
   Oh absolutely _ people look at this as a safe haven for smoking
marijuana,'' she says. She says the Vancouver police are tolerant,
although she said the place was raided in April for a violation of
drug paraphernalia laws.
</P>
<P>
   While we were in the cafe, a 10- or 11-year-old boy with a burr
haircut and a wise-ass look on his face peeked through the door of
the restaurant, put his finger to his head, and spun it, giving the
old you people are nuts'' salute.
</P>
<P>
   Nuts or not, suffice it to say the Cannabis Cafe is in the seedy
part of town, pun intended.
</P>
<P>
   British Columbia. Don't they have any bugs up here? In
Vancouver, people leave their screenless high-rise apartment
windows thrown open. Where are the area insects?
</P>
<P>
   Well, some of them are the tourist bugs who live at Victoria's
Butterfly Gardens, a lovely indoor tropical garden with about 150
kinds of butterflies flapping about inside.
</P>
<P>
   As you stroll among the plants, brightly colored flutter-byes,
as my dad used to call them, flit past. A slap-happy Texan could
sure get in trouble with a fly swatter in this place right fast.
</P>
<P>
   But the butterflies are too pretty to swat, and some of them are
lunkers. Butterfly Gardens is home to the giant Atlas moth, from
Southeast Asia, the largest moth in the world with a wing span of 6
inches to a foot. This honker could really mess up a truck
windshield.
</P>
<P>
   It's a designer moth. The , the tip of each wing on the Atlas
moth looks like a snake's head, to scare off the birds.
</P>
<P>
   Where are the mothballs when you need them? Can you imagine the
size of the hole this model could eat in your shirt?
</P>
<P>
   British Columbia. So civilized and thoughtful. In Vancouver,
when it's safe to cross at the crosswalk, an electronic
bird-chirping sound lets you know it's OK to step into the street.
</P>
<P>
   You gotta wonder if anybody has been hit by a bus because of a
passer- by swallow that had gone off at the wrong time.
</P>
<P>
   British Columbia. Land of breathtaking scenery. If you really
want to take your breath away, hike across the Capilano Suspension
Bridge, a few miles north of Vancouver. It's 450 feet across, 230
feet down to the Capilano River below, and about three feet wide.
</P>
<P>
   And it shakes from side to side and up and down as you walk
across it.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever built this must have wanted to get to the other side
real bad,'' I told Sally as we crossed this bridge, hanging on to
the cable for dear life.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever built this thing must have been certifiable, '' Sally
responded. I was too busy surviving to look down much.
</P>
<P>
   Canada. Where there's plenty to see and do at reasonable prices.
This is because the Canadian dollar, or Loonie, so-called because
of the loon on one side, was worth about 66 cents when we visited.
Because of the favorable exchange rate, it was as if everything was
on sale.
</P>
<P>
   So when we spent $124 dining in the trendy Raincity Grill, in
Vancouver' s West End, on such as tuna tartare and halibut ceviche,
we were really only spending about $80 American.
</P>
<P>
   Located on Denman Street, the Raincity Grill serves about 100
kinds of wine by the glass, and has a wine list about the size of
the Bastrop phone book. But nothing French. It's all West Coast
vintages. And no Thunderbird.
</P>
<P>
   The menu mentions free-run chicken, grilled romaine spears, and
fennel apple creme fraiche slaw. Two fire trucks went by with their
sirens running, and Sally wondered why.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know, but it sure ain't the grease trap in this place,''
I thought.
</P>
<P>
   British Columbia. A land of diverse cultures, where you can
watch the Hong Kong news on TV, or visit Vancouver's Chinatown, the
second- largest Chinatown in North America, after San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   While there, you can take a picture of the Sam Kee Building,
which, according to Ripley's Believe It or Not, at 6 feet wide is
the narrowest building in the world. Or you can walk into an herb
shop and watch herbalists mixing up the likes of dried sea horses,
snake skins and needlefish for medicinal purposes.
</P>
<P>
   So what are the snake skins for?
</P>
<P>
   Snake skin is to deep-fry it and mix it up with vegetable, and
that will give you energy,'' says Charlie Chong, a lifelong
Chinatown resident who was hanging out on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what they claim. I never eat it.''

 &HT;    Hank Williams's 75th birthday marked with new CD set
 &HT;    By Don McLeese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Hank Williams saved his best for last, or almost
last, and Austin was the beneficiary. Though he would play a pickup
date or two during the final weeks of his life, his show at the
Skyline Club on what was then the northern outskirts of town marked
the end of the final tour of his 29-year-old life. The date was
Dec. 19, 1952, and the place was packed.
</P>
<P>
   While he was still enjoying his reign as the best-selling
country artist in America, his live performances had become
increasingly chancy, due to Williams' dependence on alcohol,
morphine shots, Dexedrine and painkilling pills, which provided the
oblivion the spindly, sickly musician sought from spinal
deterioration and marital wounds. Those few promoters who continued
to book him _ including Austin's Warren Stark, who owned the
Skyline and handled the rest of Williams' dates in East and Central
Texas _ knew that there was only a 50 percent chance that he'd
show. And if he showed, there was no predicting his condition.
</P>
<P>
   During the week of his Austin date, he'd already been booed off
a stage in Houston and had canceled a show in Victoria. Earlier in
the month, at a concert in Lafayette, La., he'd stumbled onto the
stage, snarled, ``You all paid to see ol' Hank, didn't ya? Well,
you've seen him,'' and stalked off without singing a note.
</P>
<P>
   So, there was no reason to anticipate that Williams would
deliver one of the greatest and longest performances of his career
at his final hurrah in Austin. Yet, according to Colin Escott's
``Hank Williams: The Biography,'' such a triumph is exactly what
transpired. Backed by the Skyline house band and steel guitarist
Jimmy Day (the sometime Austinite who would later play with
everyone from George Jones to Don Walser), Williams pushed well
past his typical 30-40 minute performance to close the joint past 1
a.m. with two full sets, singing everything he knew, the hits more
than once or even twice. Whether or not he realized that his time
was short, he poured everything into one long night in front of
about 800 fans. Twelve days later, he was dead, perhaps on New
Year's Eve, discovered on New Year's Day, slumped and blue in the
back seat of a white Cadillac on the way to a show in Canton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Even by the punk-rock standards of a Kurt Cobain, Williams's
life was a mess. But what a glorious mess of music he left behind,
a legacy exhaustively documented through ``The Complete Hank
Williams'' (Mercury), a 10-CD collection released to commemorate
what would have been his 75th birthday today. Among the 225 cuts
are 53 previously unissued, ranging from alternate takes of
classics such as ``Lovesick Blues'' and ``Cold, Cold Heart'' to
scratchy demos from the early '40s, when he was still mimicking the
likes of Roy Acuff and Ernest Tubb while honing his songwriting
chops, to tapes of his radio, television and concert performances
to a spoken apology delivered before a concert that Williams was
unable to make.
</P>
<P>
   It also, of course, includes the entirety of his recordings for
MGM, the five-year output that has since been memorialized as the
best of country music. During his life, few suspected that
Williams' music would prove so timeless, since it seemed at the
time such a relic from a South that was behind the times, where so
many of Williams' hardcore fans didn't even enjoy the conveniences
of electricity and indoor plumbing. For all of his regional
popularity, Hank was a hayseed to mainstream America, palatable
only when a song such as ``Cold, Cold Heart'' was pasteurized by
the likes of Tony Bennett. (One of Bennett's breakthrough hits on
the pop charts, it was promoted in the musical trade publications
with the slogan: ``Popcorn! A Top Corn Tune Goes Pop.'')
</P>
<P>
   Now remembered as the greatest of country songwriters, a
populist poet, Williams enjoyed his own commercial breakthrough
with 1949's ``Lovesick Blues,'' a show tune (by Irving Mills) from
decades earlier that he was discouraged from recording. ``I'm So
Lonesome I Could Cry,'' Williams' favorite among his own
compositions, was relegated to the flip side of the novelty ``My
Bucket's Got a Hole in It.'' ``Jambalaya'' was initially considered
another novelty, the sort of commercial trifle with the shortest
shelf life, though it remains one of Williams' most often-recorded
classics. ``Your Cheatin' Heart,'' remembered as his signature
tune, wasn't even released until almost a month after Williams'
death.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Williams' most powerful material was inspired by his
combustible relationship with ``Miss Audrey,'' to whom he was
married and divorced twice, and who gave birth to Hank Jr.
(actually Randall Hank, where Hank's given name was Hiram) during
one of their off-again periods. By most accounts, she was even more
impossible than he was, making Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald look
like Ward and June Cleaver by comparison. She insisted on being
part of the act, though her singing screech was only borderline
listenable; she spent his money faster than he could make it; she
hounded him at home and cheated on him when he was on the road,
though Hank had his indiscretions as well.
</P>
<P>
   But listening to the songs that resulted _ ``Why Don't You Love
Me,'' ``You Win Again,'' ``My Love for You (Has Turned to Hate),''
``I Just Don't Like This Kind of Livin','' ``You're Gonna Change
(Or I'm Gonna Leave),'' as well as the aforementioned hits and
countless others _ makes it plain that the artistic dividends more
than justified the marital misery, at least where his artistic
legacy is concerned. Such songs reinforced his bond with his fans,
for, as Escott explains, ``he made his audience feel that ol' Hank
was truly one of them, always in the 'dawghouse,' always one step
ahead of the bill collector.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What always impressed me was how young he was and how old he
looked,'' said Sammy Allred, KVET-FM's morning curmudgeon and
musical comedian with the Geezinslaws. ``And how skinny. I was at
the Coliseum when Hank played here, two years after 'Lovesick
Blues,' 'cause I remember he said, 'I've been living off this song
for two years.' My cousin and I used to sneak in, carrying an empty
guitar case and go walking in through the back door. We started
talking to him, and Minnie Pearl was there, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he said, 'Boys, why don't we walk outside and talk so Miss
Minnie can change clothes.' Rather than saying, 'You boys got to
leave,' he walked outside with us and shot the bull and smoked a
cigarette.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever musicians threatened to make his music a little too
fancy or jazzy, Williams repeated a two-word admonition, ``Vanilla,
boys.'' The improvisatory sophistication of a Bob Wills was not for
him; he wanted his songs to retain the sturdy simplicity of the
purest hymns or the most basic blues. Upon hearing a Hank Williams
song for the first time, it sounded so familiar that you felt like
you'd been hearing it forever. And the title was imprinted on your
brain with every chorus.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, it's less a tragedy that Williams died so young
than a mystery that he managed to live so long, while compressing
so much life and accomplishment into that span. Consider that
during the final six months of his life, he was divorced from
Audrey for the second time, had an affair with Bobbie Jett that
would spawn an illegitimate daughter, married the 20-year-old
Billie Jean Jones Eshliman before her divorce was final (and would
start announcing his intention to divorce her within weeks), was
fired from the Grand Ole Opry, took a leave of absence from the
Louisiana Hayride, lost his manager and his band, saw ``Jambalaya''
top the country charts for three months straight and recorded
``Your Cheatin' Heart'' at his final session. Throughout the
period, he was alternating sanitarium visits with drinking binges,
while doping himself with painkillers that left him impotent and
incontinent.
</P>
<P>
   If he'd lived, he'd be less than a decade older than Willie
Nelson, and one can almost imagine them cutting duets together or
touring on a package promoted by some liquor company (though Nelson
long ago opted for a different kind of self-medication). One can
imagine that the rock 'n' roll revolution and the countrypolitan
transformation of Nashville might have made it harder than ever for
Williams to find a comfortable fit, though his reckless attitude,
if not his musical style, was pure rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, it's hard to imagine any other end for Hank
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death is a sound career move if timed right, and Hank
Williams's triumph was to avoid growing old disgracefully,'' writes
biographer Escott. ``In terms of forging a legend, he could have
done no better than to burn out at 29 before his fire grew dim and
the face of country music changed. Had he lived, he might have
become a poor parody of himself, shamelessly hustling remakes of
his greatest hits on cable shows. As it is, his premature death
left what is still the most important single body of work in
country music, as well as the tantalizing promise of what might
have been.''

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Michael Jordan is a very popular American among
Mexican kids.
</P>
<P>
   But the African-American basketball star sure doesn't look like
what Mexicans call a ``typical gringo.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Mexican imagination, a typical gringo -- a phrase you
often hear in Mexico -- is still considered white, blue-eyed,
blond, and probably freckled just for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Mexican political cartoonists invariably portray our
gray-haired Uncle Sam in their drawings.
</P>
<P>
   And that's how two ladies in a bank recently described President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pobre guerito (pronounced PO-bray WHERE-ee-to),'' they clucked
in Spanish, empathizing with Clinton's troubles. ``Poor little
white guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though we're close neighbors, Mexicans still seem more
comfortable picturing Americans as almost uniformly white. Perhaps
it's a convenient way to set us apart from Mexicans or Latin
Americans, who themselves range in color from quite fair to dark
brown and black.
</P>
<P>
   With my Northern European looks, I admit, I don't shatter the
gringo stereotype. And neither do most of the Americans Mexicans
see in positions of political power.
</P>
<P>
   But in city where huge billboards show Michael Jordan hawking
underwear -- and in a country from which many people have taken the
trek to multi-ethnic California -- you'd think that the truth would
be firmly rooted by now.
</P>
<P>
   Not so.
</P>
<P>
   Take a taxi driver I often employ on reporting rounds. Perhaps
for my benefit, he recently entertained me with stories about the
various Americans he has chauffeured about town during his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once,'' he said in Spanish, ``I drove one of those typical
gringas, you know, one of those real, legitimate gringas -- white,
white, white! -- out of town to see the pyramids. She wanted to
have lunch, and I asked her what she'd like to eat. And you know
what she said?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' I said, waiting for the punch line.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wanted,'' he drew a big breath and guffawed, ``. . .
tacos!''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a white, white, white gringa eating tacos was too
much to bear, I suppose, even though more salsa is now sold in the
United States than ketchup.
</P>
<P>
   I've found that even in the most sophisticated of circles the
white-equals-real-gringo stereotype persists.
</P>
<P>
   A columnist in the fine Mexico City newspaper Reforma, one of
the Mexican media's bright stars, recently wrote a series of angry
opinion pieces on the United States' sting operation called
Casablanca.
</P>
<P>
   The covert operation nabbed Mexican bankers who were allegedly
laundering money for drug traffickers, and may have included
illegal U.S. intelligence-gathering on Mexican soil.
</P>
<P>
   The columnist roundly denounced ``los gueritos,'' ``those white
people'' up north for violating Mexican sovereignty during
Casablanca and breaking various accords between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   He had a point. But I couldn't get past his repeated references
to Americans as ``those white people.''
</P>
<P>
   A Vietnamese-American friend who lives in Mexico recently
confirmed this mindset for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always call me 'la japonesita,' the 'little Japanese,'''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My neighbors call me that, even though they hear me speaking
English.''
</P>
<P>
   On rare occasions, I have found that Americans of color in
Mexico are folded into what I call ``white by association.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened to my husband, a Mexican-American who has
never regarded himself as particularly fair-complexioned.
</P>
<P>
   We were strolling through our neighborhood market together,
speaking English, when a vendor shouted out at him, trying to
entice him into buying some of his fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, white guy!'' the vendor shouted.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, this focus on skin color needs some explanation.
</P>
<P>
   In Latin American culture, color is often an identifier. Family
members or friends in Mexico are often referred to as ``guerito,''
which means ``blondie;'' or ``negrito,'' which means ``little dark
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone thinks this is a charming habit. But many Mexicans
will tell you that it's meant to be affectionate.
</P>
<P>
   People will probably argue for another 500 years of Latin
American history about whether referring so pointedly to ones'
color is racist or good-natured.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, it's taken us almost that long north of the
border to accept that real Americans are not all ``guerito.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Mexicans will catch on more quickly.

comfortable picturing Americans as almost uniformly white. Perhaps
it's a convenient way to set us apart from Mexicans or Latin
Americans, who themselves range in color from quite fair to dark
brown and black.
</P>
<P>
   With my Northern European looks, I admit, I don't shatter the
gringo stereotype. And neither do most of the Americans Mexicans
see in positions of political power.
</P>
<P>
   But in city where huge billboards show Michael Jordan hawking
underwear -- and in a country from which many people have taken the
trek to multi-ethnic California -- you'd think that the truth would
be firmly rooted by now.
</P>
<P>
   Not so.
</P>
<P>
   Take a taxi driver I often employ on reporting rounds. Perhaps
for my benefit, he recently entertained me with stories about the
various Americans he has chauffeured about town during his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once,'' he said in Spanish, ``I drove one of those typical
gringas, you know, one of those real, legitimate gringas -- white,
white, white! -- out of town to see the pyramids. She wanted to
have lunch, and I asked her what she'd like to eat. And you know
what she said?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' I said, waiting for the punch line.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wanted,'' he drew a big breath and guffawed, ``. . .
tacos!''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a white, white, white gringa eating tacos was too
much to bear, I suppose, even though more salsa is now sold in the
United States than ketchup.
</P>
<P>
   I've found that even in the most sophisticated of circles the
white-equals-real-gringo stereotype persists.
</P>
<P>
   A columnist in the fine Mexico City newspaper Reforma, one of
the Mexican media's bright stars, recently wrote a series of angry
opinion pieces on the United States' sting operation called
Casablanca.
</P>
<P>
   The covert operation nabbed Mexican bankers who were allegedly
laundering money for drug traffickers, and may have included
illegal U.S. intelligence-gathering on Mexican soil.
</P>
<P>
   The columnist roundly denounced ``los gueritos,'' ``those white
people'' up north for violating Mexican sovereignty during
Casablanca and breaking various accords between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   He had a point. But I couldn't get past his repeated references
to Americans as ``those white people.''
</P>
<P>
   A Vietnamese-American friend who lives in Mexico recently
confirmed this mindset for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always call me 'la japonesita,' the 'little Japanese,'''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My neighbors call me that, even though they hear me speaking
English.''
</P>
<P>
   On rare occasions, I have found that Americans of color in
Mexico are folded into what I call ``white by association.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened to my husband, a Mexican-American who has
never regarded himself as particularly fair-complexioned.
</P>
<P>
   We were strolling through our neighborhood market together,
speaking English, when a vendor shouted out at him, trying to
entice him into buying some of his fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, white guy!'' the vendor shouted.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, this focus on skin color needs some explanation.
</P>
<P>
   In Latin American culture, color is often an identifier. Family
members or friends in Mexico are often referred to as ``guerito,''
which means ``blondie;'' or ``negrito,'' which means ``little dark
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone thinks this is a charming habit. But many Mexicans
will tell you that it's meant to be affectionate.
</P>
<P>
   People will probably argue for another 500 years of Latin
American history about whether referring so pointedly to ones'
color is racist or good-natured.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, it's taken us almost that long north of the
border to accept that real Americans are not all ``guerito.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Mexicans will catch on more quickly.
</P>

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: Given all of the strong shifts in the stock market recently,
how many dollars are gained or lost in stocks for every 100-point
move in the Dow Jones Industrial Average?
</P>
<P>
   A: In terms of dollars lost, investors took their worst hit ever
this past Aug. 31, when the value of all U.S. stocks dropped by
roughly $630 billion, said Myrone Greene, Georgia State University
business professor emeritus and publisher of the Mutual Fund Timing
Guide. On that day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 512
points, so 100 points was equivalent to about $123 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently watched a series on TV about the Holocaust. I'm
confused about the SS and the Gestapo. What do the letters SS stand
for? How does one relate to the other? Of the two, which was the
worst?
</P>
<P>
   A: SS is an abbreviation of Schutzstaffel, meaning ``protective
echelon'' in German. The Gestapo, an abbreviation of Geheime
Staats-Polizei (meaning ``secret state police''), was part of it.
Both had similar aims and overlapping functions.
</P>
<P>
   The SS, the black-uniformed elite corps of the Nazi Party, was
founded by Adolf Hitler in1925 as a small, personal bodyguard. By
the time the Nazis came to power in 1933, it had grown under
Heinrich Himmler to more than 50,000 members; by 1939, it was a
massive and labyrinthian bureaucracy numbering 250,000. The SS was
divided mainly into two groups, the Allgemeine-SS (General SS) and
the Waffen-SS (Armed SS). The most important division within the
General SS was the Reich Security Central Office, made up of the
Order Police and the Security Police. In turn, the Security Police
was divided into the Criminal Police and the Gestapo.
</P>
<P>
   The Gestapo's ruthless methods of capture, torture and
extermination; the fact that it was responsible for all
concentration camps; and its exemption from any control by the
courts made it a symbol for brutal, sadistic repression. After the
defeat of Nazi Germany by the Allies, the SS and the Gestapo were
formally declared criminal organizations by the Allied Tribunal in
Nuremberg in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Both the SS and the Gestapo were powerful, deadly and much
dreaded, so it's hard to say which was the more evil. A case could
be made for either one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: While shopping at a department store recently, a woman, upon
payment of her purchases, presented the clerk with what she called
a ``tax-exempt card.'' Who issues these cards, and who qualifies
for them?
</P>
<P>
   A: Tax-exempt identification cards are issued by the State
Department to foreign consulates and eligible foreign diplomats.
The tax exemption is granted as a part of several foreign treaties
and extends to all types of tax, not just sales tax. U.S. diplomats
and consulates enjoy the same exemption in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Scenes in ``Saving Private Ryan'' depicting the D-Day
invasion at Omaha Beach actually were filmed in Ireland. But were
the opening and closing scenes at a cemetery filmed in Normandy?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, at the Normandy American Cemetery on a cliff overlooking
Omaha Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is the video version of ``Titanic'' doing in sales and
rentals?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's sinking all competitors, just like it did on the big
screen for so long. ``Titanic'' has been out on video only since
Sept. 1. A spokeswoman at VideoScan in Los Angeles estimated that
as of Sept. 6, ``Titanic'' video sales at more than 15 million
copies, based on sales of 6 million alone tracked by VideoScan,
which represents about 40 percent of the total market. A spokesman
at the Video Software Dealers Association in Los Angeles said
nationwide rentals for the period ending Sept. 6 totaled about
$8.46 million.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read about a $10,000 Federal Reserve note, but since I'm
never likely to see one, I am curious: Whose picture was on it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Salmon P. Chase (Treasury secretary, 1861-64).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some time ago, it was reported that scientists aboard an
aircraft were experimenting with releasing chemicals into the
center of a hurricane to see if it could cause the storm to
disperse. Whatever became of that?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're referring to Operation Stormfury. Scientists conducted
experiments seeding clouds with silver iodine crystals, said Frank
Lepore of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. The experiments
were done with hurricanes Esther (1961), Beulah (1963), Debbie
(1969) and Ginger (1971) when they were over the Atlantic far from
land.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists targeted convective clouds just outside the eye
wall in an attempt to form a new ring of clouds that, it was hoped,
would compete with the natural circulation of the storm and weaken
it. That didn't happen, for reasons that weren't confirmed until
the 1980s, Lepore said. For cloud seeding to be successful, the
clouds must contain supercool water, colder than freezing, but not
yet ice. Most hurricanes don't have enough such cold water, so the
experiments were termed a failure.
</P>
<P>
   The National Academy of Science has since concluded that more
complete understanding of the physical processes of a hurricane is
needed before undertaking any more ``modification experiments,'' so
Operation Stormfury and any other such projects were discontinued
in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When will the next total eclipse occur?
</P>
<P>
   A: It will be a solar eclipse on Aug. 11, 1999, and will be
visible in Europe, the Middle East and India.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that a luxury ship is under construction, and
the cabins will be sold like condominiums. It will sail all over
the world. Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: A company registered in the Bahamas is proposing such a
concept. At the moment, the vessel, to be called The World of
ResidenSea, exists only as a brass model, glossy brochures and a
video, but ResidenSea Ltd. officials claim to have sold 62 units
worth almost $120 million, according to Business Week. Brochures
say the 86,000-ton, 958-foot-long ship will be composed of units
costing between $1.5 million and $6.6 million. Annual maintenance
fees also will be high: $61,500 for a 1,105-square-foot unit,
$271,800 for a 2,436-square-foot version.
</P>
<P>
   ResidenSea is the brainchild of Knut Kloster Jr., whose father
founded Norwegian Caribbean Line, which later became Norwegian
Cruise Line.
</P>
<P>
   While the concept resembles a floating condo, residents won't
really own their homes like condo owners do, Business Week said.
The company structured documents to resemble condo agreements, but
residents actually would be buying a 50-year lease. In addition to
the leased units, ResidenSea will rent out 183 guest suites on the
ship.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have read that a player in the Negro Baseball Leagues hit
more than 80 home runs in one season. Can you discuss his
accomplishments?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're probably thinking about Josh Gibson, dubbed by some
``the black Babe Ruth.'' According to the book A Who's Who of
Sports Champions, the Negro Leagues didn't keep accurate records,
but it goes on to say Gibson was credited with ``as many as 84 home
runs in a season, which might include as many as 200 games, and he
is believed to have hit nearly 800 home runs in his 17 seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   The Baseball Encyclopedia lists Gibson as having hit a total of
146 home runs in 17 years; the most it lists for him in a single
year is 17, in 1939. A spokesman at the National Baseball Hall of
Fame explained the discrepancy by saying the Baseball Encyclopedia
prints statistics only for the games it could find statistics for,
and might include very few games out of the larger number of games
that actually took place in any one season.
</P>
<P>
   Several Internet sites dealing with Gibson also vary in the
details. One says he hit ``about 800 home runs in the 17 years he
played, including 75 in the 1931 season.'' Another, Sports
Illustrated's SIonline, credits Gibson with 962 home runs in his
17-year career.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson was born in Buena Vista, Ga., in 1911 and died in 1947,
the year Jackie Robinson became the first black player in the major
leagues. Gibson, who played with the Pittsburgh Homestead Grays and
the Pittsburgh Crawfords, was inducted into the National Baseball
Hall of Fame in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Q: With all the publicity about the Titanic, I'm reminded of the
Lusitania, which was sunk by a German U-boat, drawing the United
States into World War I. Was it ever determined that the Lusitania
was hauling munitions, as the Germans claimed?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. The Lusitania, sunk by a German submarine May 7, 1915,
was carrying a cargo of about 173 tons of rifle ammunition and
shells. The Germans, who had circulated warnings that the ship
would be subject to being torpedoed, felt fully justified in
attacking a vessel that was furthering the war aims of their enemy.
The German government also felt that, in view of the vulnerability
of U-boats while on the surface and the British announcement of
intentions to arm merchant ships, prior warning of targets was
impractical.
</P>
<P>
   The British Admiralty had warned the Lusitania to avoid the area
off the south coast of Ireland amid reports of submarine activity
and the sinking of merchant ships. The ship's crew chose to ignore
those recommendations. Within 20 minutes of being struck, the
Lusitania sank and 1,198 people _ including 128 U.S. citizens _
lost their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The United States sent a note to Berlin on May 13, 1915,
expressing an indictment of the principles on which the submarine
war was being fought, but it and two other notes were the only
immediate reaction to the Lusitania sinking. Only in 1917 did the
United States cite German submarine warfare as a justification for
American entry into the war.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that President Clinton was nominated for the
Nobel Peace Prize, yet I've seen nothing in the media about it. Is
it true?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. It was widely reported in late January when Clinton was
nominated by members of the Party of Progress, one of the largest
blocs in Norway's Parliament. The Norwegian lawmakers nominated him
for his efforts to protect world peace and promote democracy.
``Throughout his presidency, he has been a guarantor and friend of
peace,'' the lawmakers said in a statement. They praised Clinton
for helping end the war in Bosnia and for standing up to ``despots
who want to repress human rights and democracy's rules of fair
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Norway's national legislatures are among those with
Nobel nomination rights, and they often announce the name of their
candidates. The Oslo-based Nobel awards committee normally refuses
to release the names of nominees, usually in the range of 120-130
each year, or comment on candidates. The winner is announced in
Oslo, usually in mid-October, and the award is presented Dec. 10,
the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, the Swede who endowed
the prizes.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Norwegian legislators, Vidar Kleppe, said the
decision to nominate Clinton was made last December, before
knowledge of Clinton's ``inappropriate relationship'' with Monica
Lewinsky became widespread.

   UNDATED: Q: I understand that President Clinton was nominated

it. Is it true?
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do the letters KLM stand for in the name of the Dutch
airline?
</P>
<P>
   A: Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij (Royal Airline Co.)
</P>
<P>
   Q: Someone recently mentioned the ``harvest moon,'' but didn't
say when it would be, or where it gets that name. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's the full moon nearest the autumnal equinox. It generally
ushers in a period of several successive days when the moon rises
soon after sunset, giving farmers in temperate latitudes extra
hours of light in which to harvest their crops before frost and
winter come. The 1998 harvest moon has just occurred, said David
Dundee, astronomer at Fernbank Science Center. It was Sept. 6. The
next full moon, called the hunter's moon, will fall on Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Some people think the harvest moon is larger than normal, Dundee
said, but it's an optical illusion occuring because the angle at
which the harvest moon rises from the horizon is at its most
oblique. The eye and brain, viewing and interpreting the moon in
the context of buildings and trees which are at a greater distance,
translate the image and see a moon that appears larger than usual.
But, of course, the harvest moon is the same size as any other full
moon.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard a broadcaster say recently that NASA scientists had
evidence that there was a second eye within Hurricane Bonnie,
indicating that it was, in essence, a ``pregnant hurricane.'' Is
that possible? I never heard of such a thing.
</P>
<P>
   A: Neither has the National Hurricane Center in Miami. That
report most likely was hyperbole, said the center's Frank Lepore.
There are occasions when a hurricane has concentric eye walls, but
it's not a second eye, and it wouldn't cause a subsequent hurricane
to be spun off.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest part of a hurricane is an area right around the
eye, called the eye wall, Lepore explained. It's a warm core center
where the fastest winds are located. There are essentially bands of
thunderstorms wrapped around the eye, and if two such bands exist,
with a space between them, the hurricane would have a double eye
wall. But that couldn't be termed a second eye, and it wouldn't
make a hurricane ``pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've often heard of the 1940s blacklist of supposed
Communists in Hollywood. Were any of those people identified
publicly?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Nine writers and one director who refused to cooperate
with the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1947 were
imprisoned for up to a year for being ``unfriendly witnesses.''
They were Alvah Bessie, Herbert Biberman, Lester Cole, Edward
Dmytryk, Ring Lardner Jr., John Howard Lawson, Albert Maltz, Samuel
Ornitz, Adrian Scott and Dalton Trumbo.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the case of an airliner disabled over water, like the
Swissair MD-11that crashed recently, would it be possible for
pilots to glide it, or land it under power, on the ocean surface?
</P>
<P>
   A: In interviews after the Sept. 2 crash of Swissair Flight 111,
pilots have speculated that in attempting to ditch a plane, the
preferred method would be to keep the engines running and to
approach the water at speeds of about 150 miles an hour, with the
nose of the plane slightly higher than normal so the tail would
touch the surface first. With luck, they said, the plane would act
somewhat like a skipping stone before settling gently into the
water.
</P>
<P>
   But that is based on computer simulations and engineering
calculations. For obvious reasons, ditching can't be practiced, and
pilots who have spoken on the subject said it's not part of their
training on simulators.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent attempt of a pilot trying to land an airliner in
water occurred in November 1996 off the Comoros islands in the
Indian Ocean. A hijacked Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 767, which had
run out of fuel, apparently was attempting to come in for a
daylight landing on relatively calm seas when a wing-tip dipped,
caught the water, and the plane cartwheeled and broke into several
pieces. Of the 175 people on board, only 52 survived.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How old was Roger Maris when he when he died, and what was
the cause of death?
</P>
<P>
   A: He was 51 when he died Dec. 14, 1985, after a two-year battle
with lymphatic cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it true that Hillary Rodham Clinton helped write the
articles of impeachment to be used when President Richard Nixon was
facing possible impeachment?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's true. As has been widely reported for many years,
Hillary Rodham, who graduated from Yale Law School in 1973, joined
the impeachment inquiry staff of the House Judiciary Committee in
January 1974 as a low-level attorney. Her work with the committee
led to several prestigious job offers after Nixon's resignation,
but she decided to move later that same year to Fayetteville, Ark.,
to teach law at the University of Arkansas and to be near Bill
Clinton. They were married in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How long has the company Gap been in business? What is the
origin of the name?
</P>
<P>
   A: Gap founder Don Fisher, a San Francisco real estate
developer, opened the first Gap store in 1969 on Ocean Avenue in
San Francisco. He had been trying to exchange a pair of jeans, and
after visiting store after store, noticed that jeans departments
were disorganized, poorly stocked and difficult to shop. So he and
his wife, Doris, created a jeans store neatly organized by size.
The store, which also sold records, was named after a cultural
phenomenon that was the talk of the times: the Generation Gap. As
the chain grew, it also began selling other merchandise, and in1974
began creating its own private-label clothing and accessories. In
1991, Gap announced that by year-end everything it sold would be
under the company's own label.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know about the bunker at the Greenbrier Hotel in West
Virginia built decades ago to protect goverment officials in case
of war, but I recently heard about another one somewhere else. Do
you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: You may be referring to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency's bunker inside Mount Weather near Berryville, Va., about 50
miles from Washington. It wasn't intended to house government
officials in case of an attack on Washington, like the secret,
fortified building at the Greenbrier Hotel in White Sulphur
Springs, W.Va., built under orders by President Dwight Eisenhower.
Instead, what FEMA called its ``special facility'' is the hub for
much of the agency's classified communication. It's still in use,
but has been supplemented by Mobile Emergency Response Support
units, developed during President Ronald Reagan's administration
because of concerns that increasingly accurate and powerful nuclear
weapons could wipe out Mount Weather.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors also have it that a bunker to house government officials
has been constructed beneath a new FBI building at Clarksburg,
W.Va., but for obvious reasons, details are scant.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What can you tell us about the famous Japanese home run king,
Mr. Oh? Is he still playing?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sadaharu Oh hit more home runs _ 868 _ than anyone else in
Japanese or American professional baseball history in the 22 years
before he retired from the Tokyo Yomiuri Giants in 1980. At the end
of his career, he also had recorded 2,786 hits; 2,170 runs batted
in; and a .301 batting average out of 9,250 at-bats in 2,831 games.
Oh, born in 1940 in Tokyo, still holds the record for more runs
batted in than any other batter in Japanese professional baseball.
Famous for his ``flamingo'' hitting form with one leg off the
ground, Oh was awarded Japan's first National Medal of Honor when
he surpassed Hank Aaron's home run record of 756 in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Oh credited several things for his success. He was known to
drink a secret blend of ginseng tea, a traditional Asian brew for
energy. And Hiroshi Arakawa, Oh's batting coach, and Oh spent three
years training with the founder of the martial art of aikido, where
the concept of extending one's spirit, called ki, is the source of
physical power.
</P>
<P>
   But there's an asterisk involved in comparing American baseball
to that played in Japan. Japanese fences are shorter, 300 feet down
the line. In the United States, the norm is a distance of 325 feet
or more down the foul lines to the fence and rounding out to 400
feet or more in straightaway center field. The Japanese also play
with a smaller ball.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When investigators recover flight data recorders from an
aircraft accident, such as TWA 800 and Swissair 111, they're put
into a cooler with water in it. Why is this done?
</P>
<P>
   A: After the recorders have been recovered from being in ocean
water, they're put into fresh water to wash the salts off, said
Preston Hicks of the National Transportation Safety Board. It's a
measure intended to preserve the recorders. The water also keeps
air away from them, inhibiting the onset of corrosion, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In a live interview on CNN recently, and in a photo in the
newspaper, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi appeared to be seated in a
motorized wheelchair. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: Gadhafi's appearance in a mechanized wheelchair reignited
interest in reports that his motorcade had been shot at by an
Islamic group near the eastern Libya city of Beida a few months
ago, but in the Aug. 27 interview, he said he had broken his left
leg when he fell ``while taking part in sports.'' Other published
reports said he underwent hip surgery in July. The day after the
surgery, film of the operation was said to have been broadcast by
Libyan television.
</P>
<P>
   Gadhafi, 56, resumed normal work a few days later, and was
undergoing physical therapy, according to the Libyan news agency
JANA.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his wheelchair and his condition, Gadhafi told CNN
that he was feeling fine. He laughed, shifted in his chair _
apparently to show his flexibility _ and said the interview should
move on to more serious subjects. As he spoke, his left hand
tightly gripped a movable handle on the wheelchair, suggesting he
might have had to hold on in order to keep his hand from flailing
about.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm confused. I often see airplane passengers using on-board
telephones, but Q&AMP;A said recently that cell phones are prohibited.
Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: The on-board public telephones, generally inset into the
seatback in front of a passenger, are of a type whose emissions
have been carefully evaluated and found not to be a threat to the
aircraft's navigational and electrical systems, said Delta
spokesman Bill Berry. The use of cell phones that a passenger
brings on board are banned because the phones might emit signals
thant is imminent. Businesses along O'Connell Street, from
bookstores to fast food outlets to department stores, enjoy a
steady stream of customers, especially since there is no such thing
as an American-style regional mall in Limerick, or Ireland, for
that matter.
</P>
<P>
   The recent prosperity has fostered optimism in the people of
Limerick, many of whom still show pride in their forebearers'
efforts to repel the British. The Treaty Stone, near Thomond Bridge
on the west bank of the River Shannon, marks the site where the
Treaty of Limerick was signed in 1691, ending a seige of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Across the river is King John's Castle, built by the English
king in about 1200 to withstand more powerful cannons. It bears
scars from the seige of 1691.
</P>
<P>
   McCourt called the Shannon ``the river that kills'' because the
cold dampness it gave off was suspected of making people sick.
Relatively placid most of the time for such a major river, it
churns dark and powerful when the North Atlantic tide is in. The
tide conveniently submerges numerous metal carts that were taken
from a downtown shopping center and tossed over a fence at the
river's edge. Over time the carts have gathered moss and muck in
the shallows of the Shannon.
</P>
<P>
   Officials recognize the tourism potential of the river, however.
There is talk of making it fully navigable so that boaters can
travel between Limerick and Dublin. A modern visitors center near
Arthur's Quay (pronounced ``key'') Park on the banks of the Shannon
in downtown Limerick has a wealth of information about Limerick's
museums and other attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors who want to stroll in a more bucolic setting can take
the short drive to Adare, about 10 miles southwest of Limerick.
Dell executives, when they visit Dell's Limerick plants, stay in
Adare Manor, an 840-acre estate intersected by the Maigue River.
The Gothic-style edifice with 75 fireplaces formerly was known as
Dunraven Manor after Lord and Lady Dunraven, who built it over
several decades starting in 1832.
</P>
<P>
   It includes a lush golf course, French gardens and giant trees.
Visitors are welcome but pay a fee to walk on the beautiful
grounds. The spacious Dunraven Stateroom fetches about $500 a night
(353-61-396566).
</P>
<P>
   Adare is a tidy and tourist-friendly hamlet featuring postcard
quality cottages with thatched roofs. Many have been converted into
craft shops and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The Adare Heritage Centre in the village provides a brief
history of the area. In summer evenings, the center schedules
performances of traditional Irish music, dancing and stories
(353-61-396666).
</P>
<P>
   The Dunraven Arms Hotel, a traditional inn built in 1792, is a
popular lodging and dining spot and more budget-friendly than Adare
Manor (353-61-396633).
</P>
<P>
   Lough Gur, a lake nestled in a hilly region where pre-Celtic
settlers lived 5,000 years ago, is a short drive southeast of
Adare. It also has a visitors center.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1400 and nicely restored, Bunratty Castle in Clare
County northwest of Limerick doesn't accommodate overnight guests.
But visitors are invited to spend a couple of hours at a
re-creation of a medieval banquet in the ``Great Hall'' high above
the Ratty River. At the top of a worn and winding stone staircase
that would make litigation-averse U.S. restaurateurs very nervous,
the room also holds a collection of furniture and wall hangings
dating back several centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by harp and violin, comely maidens in costume
perform period music. A tasty meal, served in courses, includes
mead, a wine made with honey. In a nod to the custom of the time,
diners eat with their fingers, but get knives and bibs
(353-61-360788).
</P>
<P>
   Bunratty Folk Park, a reconstructed Irish village on the castle
grounds, offers traditional Irish music on summer nights. Food is
served next door at the popular Durty Nelly's, an authentic,
17th-century pub with worn wooden benches, a low ceiling and an
uneven floor.
</P>
<P>
   While Continental cuisine is making its way into Ireland,
visitors still have to be on the lookout for an excellent repast in
most of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Gooser's Pub &AMP; Restaurant, north of Limerick in the village of
Ballina, is a fine restaurant . Dell Computer employees with a
little extra cash to spend recommend Quenelle's Restaurant in
Limerick (353-61-411111).
</P>
<P>
   Homesick visitors from the Lone Star State may want to check out
the Texas Steakout in Limerick. Most restaurants stop serving by
9:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland is full of bed-and-breakfast inns, in part because the
government gives start-up money to families who decide to go into
that business. So if B&AMP;B's are your style, request a list of inns
from the Shannon tourism office. For about $70 a night, many inns
offer the famous Irish friendliness, a cozy fireplace and the
traditional Irish breakfast: eggs, sausage, bacon, fried tomatoes
and toast. Lighter fare also is available.
</P>
<P>
   Kincora Hall in Killaloe, which is across the Shannon from
Ballina, is clean, quiet (if a riverbank-construction project is
finished) and a good spot from which to embark for Ireland's
beautiful West Coast (353-61-376000).
</P>
<P>
   At the West Clare village of Carrigaholt, a couple of hours
drive away, tour boats head into the mouth of the Shannon to watch
one of the North Atlantic's few resident dolphin populations
(353-65-58156).
</P>
<P>
   Head north and you'll see the Cliffs of Moher, which by
themselves are worth the trip from Limerick, Killaloe or, for that
matter, from anywhere on the small island. Located between the
resort of Lahinch and the putative center of Irish music, Doolin,
the sheer, shale cliffs tower straight up from the gray North
Atlantic that pounds almost inaudibly hundreds of feet below. If
the weather is clear, visitors can see the Aran Islands at the
entrance to Galway Bay to the northwest.
</P>
<P>
   From the visitors center, cliff top hiking trails go north and
south and offer a superb view of an ocean sunset. Landmarks include
O'Brien's Tower north of the visitors center. Built in the early
1800s to impress visitors, it is on the cliffs' highest point, 700
feet above the ocean. The visitors center, which includes a tea
room, is open every day. (353-65-81171).
</P>
<P>
   Of more historic significance is the signal tower a couple of
miles south at Hag's Head, where the gradually descending cliffs
jut into the sea. From inside the stone outpost, when a strong wind
blows out to sea, it's easy to imagine a lonely sentinel shivering
as he searched the horizon for signs of a feared invasion by
Napoleon.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors planning to head north from The Cliffs of Moher to hear
music in the pubs of Doolin should arrive early enough to claim
seats near the musicians. The pubs fill with talkative locals and
the chatter can drown out the music. That's no disaster, of course.
The urge to make music is strong in many Irish men and women, and
there is likely to be someone else performing the next night in
another village.

 &HT;    Lewis Carroll Centenary Exhibition
 &HT;    By Michael Barnes
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Who was Lewis Carroll, the mysterious man behind
the ageless classic, ``Alice's Adventures in Wonderland''?
</P>
<P>
   An exhaustive exhibit at the University of Texas, which houses
one of the world's largest collections of Carroll memorabilia,
parts the thick Victorian curtains that once shielded the life of
the Oxford don, a childless bachelor who died 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a child, essentially,'' said John Kirkpatrick, one of
the curators for UT's Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center. ``He
was shy, most at ease in the company of children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Reflections in a Looking Glass: A Lewis Carroll Centenary
Exhibition,'' located at the Leeds Gallery in the Flawn Academic
Building, offers substantial evidence to support this conclusion.
The curators put under glass Carroll's correspondence, doodlings,
photographs, small possessions and, of course, his books in scores
of editions and languages. They portray a man who operated
competently in the adult world, but preferred, according to
``Solitude,'' his 1856 poem, ``To be once more a little child.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past two decades, Carroll's personal history has been
the subject of intense literary interest, especially after the 1982
appearance of ``The Real Alice'' by Anne Clark. That book examined
Carroll's longtime interaction with Alice Lydell, one of hundreds
of little girls befriended by the Oxford mathematician.
</P>
<P>
   To Americans sensitized to the potential scandal of an adult man
obsessed by young girls, Carroll lived in an impossibly distant
time and place. The son of a clergyman, Carroll, whose real name
was Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, grew up in a large, close family and
graduated from Oxford University with honors. He thrived within
this small, green enclosure all his life and it protected him from
vast social changes in the larger, more brutal industrialized
world.
</P>
<P>
   Given this cultural disconnect, ``Reflections in a Looking
Glass'' feels a bit creepy, at times. There are numerous
romanticized photographs and drawings of little girls, letters to
little girls, as well as puzzles, stories, books and toys, all
created for little girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am fond of children (except boys),'' Carroll once said.
</P>
<P>
   ``From everything we know, he did nothing untoward with these
girls,'' Kirkpatrick said. ``He never seems to have had a sexual
relationship with anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt Carroll was a great author and a pioneer
of the photographic portrait. Besides children, he shot
celebrities, figurative groups and landscapes, examples of which
are on view at the Leeds. ``(It's) my one amusement,'' Carroll once
wrote of photography.
</P>
<P>
   ``All in all, he was one of the best photographers of children
in the 19th century,'' said Roy Flukinger, Ransom curator of
photography.
</P>
<P>
   The Ransom Center owns 240 of Carroll's photographs, more than
any other institution.
</P>
<P>
   There is much of literary interest here, too. The exhibit
includes a copy of the 1865 ``suppressed'' edition of
``Adventures,'' valued at $100,000. An outgrowth of an outing with
three little sisters in 1862, the first run of this key book was
rejected because illustrator John Tennial was unhappy with the
printing. These copies were distributed to children's hospitals and
were later presumed tattered into nonexistence.
</P>
<P>
   A tea grower encountered one, however, on a dirt floor in
Bangalore, India, in the 1950s. He eventually realized that the
1865 date on the title page was significant, to say the least. The
book was auctioned in 1961 to noted mathematician Warren Weaver,
who became the world's most avid collector of Carroll material. His
hoard, including a rare 1920s edition of ``Adventures,'' in Russian
by Vladimir Nabokov, arrived at the Ransom Center in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   According to one story, Queen Victoria, an admirer of
``Adventures,'' told Carroll, ``I'd like to see your next book.''
She might have been disappointed by the thick mathematical tome, on
display at the Leeds, which he issued after ``Adventures.''
</P>
<P>
   Never a good college teacher, the eccentric Carroll struggled
with a stammer that left him fondly tolerated by Oxonians.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was kind of fussy,'' said Richard Oram, head librarian for
the Ransom Center, ``but very well organized. He would have been a
good librarian.''
</P>
<P>
   The displays, best viewed clockwise from the entrance, are
overpowering in their thoroughness and consistent quality.
</P>
<P>
   Oram thinks that any Carroll-lover will find something of
interest at the Leeds Gallery: ``This is the only place in the
world where you can see the true multiplicity of the man.

 &HT;    Sosa breaking records, winning over fans
 &HT;    By Cheryl Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The joy can't be taught.
</P>
<P>
   Patience at the plate, dropping the hands, aiming for right
field _ those can be learned and perfected and turned into 62 home
runs.
</P>
<P>
   But the happiness, the celebration, the deflection of glory onto
another is as much a part of Sammy Sosa as his heart. That, more
than his ability to hit balls completely out of ballparks, has made
Sosa's adopted country adopt him as its own.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, the right fielder for the Chicago Cubs, became only the
second man to hit 62 homers in a season when he his second homer of
the game Sunday, tying St. Louis Cardinals first baseman Mark
McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   He marked the moment with his usual hop-skip to start his trot.
He then tapped his fingers to his heart and to his lips, blowing
kisses for his mother back home in San Pedro de Macoris, Dominican
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, 29, really is living the American dream, simply with a
Latin twist. He is a self-made millionaire, a child who grew up
with nothing and who now has everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a holiday for me, everyday,'' Sosa said. ``Every
time I wake up, I say, `God bless America.' It is a beautiful
country.''
</P>
<P>
   This might explain why he spends much of his time deferring to
McGwire, who broke Roger Maris' single-season home run record of 61
on Sept. 8 in St. Louis. McGwire's accomplishment came in a game
against Sosa's Cubs, and Sosa, who calls McGwire, ``The Man,'' ran
from right field and into McGwire's arms during the post-homer
jamboree.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't bother Sosa that, when he hit his 62nd, the Maris
family was not in the stands as they were for McGwire's. Sosa is
not disappointed baseball Commissioner Bud Selig was not there when
Sosa hit No. 62 against the Milwaukee Brewers, the team Selig owns.
Sosa is completely unperturbed by the fact that the balls from his
two big homers were not specially marked for authenticity, as
McGwire's were.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people want to know if I think I haven't gotten as much
out of this as McGwire,'' he said. ``The attention I have been
having all year has been good enough for me. Mark did it first. He
was the man. I'm just so happy to be playing in the United States
and be the person that I am. I'm pleased with what I have right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa did not grow up on the well-tended little league fields of
McGwire's youth in Southern California and he didn't play organized
baseball until he was 14. He sometimes had to use a milk carton for
a glove because there was no extra money for games. He'd sell
oranges or shine shoes on street corners to help support his
widowed mother, Lucrecia, four brothers and two sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa was invited by Omar Minaya, then a scout for the Texas
Rangers, for a tryout in 1985. He was a skinny 16-year-old with a
hole in his spikes and an even bigger hole in his swing. Still,
there was something about his approach that stuck with Minaya, and
he eventually offered Sosa $3,500 to sign.
</P>
<P>
   It was a small fortune, most of which Sosa gave to his mother.
For himself, he bought a bicycle. Four years later, Sosa was in the
big leagues. He had made it, and yet he had not.
</P>
<P>
   He was traded to the Chicago White Sox for Harold Baines after
playing just 25 games with the Rangers in 1989, his first
major-league season. He batted .233 with 15 homers and an
eye-popping 150 strikeouts, and batted .203 with 10 homers and 98
strikeouts in '91. He was then traded to the Cubs for George Bell
right before opening day of '92.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa became the first Cubs 30-30 player in '93 when he stole 36
bases and hit 33 homers. He built a shopping mall in his hometown
and called it 30-30 Plaza in honor of his accomplishment, which he
repeated in '95.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs showed enough faith in his abilities to sign him to a
$42.5 million, four-year deal before last season. He had the
reputation of a guy who was not completely committed to the game,
spending too much time goofing around with the younger players.
</P>
<P>
   His work with Cubs hitting coach Jeff Pentland has made a
tremendous difference in Sosa's approach. Pentland, who was let go
by the Florida Marlins in 1996, joined the Cubs in '97.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa is still known as more of a free-swinger than McGwire, but
has become much more selective. His numbers reflect this: He hit 20
homers in June, is batting .312 and his 68 walks surpass his career
high.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Sosa continues to have fun. He has remained
relaxed, or ``Rico Suave,'' as he puts it, as he moves into the
spotlight McGwire has occupied all season. He has become, as he
says McGwire is in this country, ``The Man'' in the Dominican
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They loved him before the season started, but now I think
people are really proud,'' said Montreal Expos manager Felipe Alou,
who is also from the Dominican. ``I know I am, of his behavior and
his professionalism during this chase. Sammy Sosa was signed when
he was 16 years old, and when you get signed that early, you spend
12 months a year in a ballpark. Our kids don't go to college, maybe
not even all the way through high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your average kid from the Dominican Republic doesn't have that
type of polish, so Sosa, under the circumstances, has been
outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Cincinnati Reds pitcher Jose Rijo knows what it's like to
be a national hero in the small country. Even though the Dominicans
have embraced McGwire as McGwire's country has done Sosa, it is
Sosa they all pretend to be on the baseball fields of the school he
built down there, on the streets, everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The security guard at my building is holding a machine gun in
one hand and a radio (listening to the Cubs game) in the other,''
Rijo said. ``I've never seen anything like it down there.
Everyone's following Sammy.''
</P>
<P>
   No one's seen anything like it here, either.

 &HT;    Happy days could be here again for UM
 &HT;    By Dave George
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORAL GABLES, Fla. _ Oh, great. Up ahead, on the horizon, it's
the Hokie Hump, tallest point in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a mountaineering feat more challenging than any of our
majestic landfill mounds, but should the 2-0 Miami Hurricanes crest
the summit, a whole new world of possibilities will stretch before
them.
</P>
<P>
   A return to the Top 25, where Badgers and Cavaliers and even
Ducks have found a place but not mighty Miami. A running start at
the No. 5 UCLA Bruins, who are due at the Orange Bowl next week. A
reason to believe that bowl representatives may yet visit Coral
Gables for more than a winter tan.
</P>
<P>
   So tell me, who will lead the charge over Hokie Hump,
representative of a victory over Virginia Tech? Senior quarterback
Scott Covington, picked off twice in the end zone at the end of a
1996 loss to the Hokies, gets the first shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we've had a good game plan against Virginia Tech,''
Covington said Tuesday, ``but for some reason they've had our
number the past couple of years. I think our number is probably
going to come up this year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably'' wouldn't have cut it with the Hurricanes of old,
who scrambled to the newspapers each morning to see which player's
outrageous claims of global dominance would create the biggest
stink.
</P>
<P>
   For Michael Irvin or Randal Hill or Jerome Brown to use
``probably'' in an interview, it could only have been in response
to a question like ``Will the Hokies have enough players left to
complete their schedule after playing the killer 'Canes?'' Or
``Will you allow the Hokies to stand throughout the conclusion of
the national anthem before taking their first hit?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, those guys were participants in an NCAA-record streak
of 58 consecutive home victories. This current crop of Hurricanes
lost three times at the Orange Bowl last season alone.
</P>
<P>
   So it's back to the serious business of climbing Hokie Hump,
once as elementary as the hokey-pokey around here. Miami won its
first 12 meetings with Virginia Tech, after all. What does Edgerrin
James, No. 8 on the Hurricanes' all-time rushing list, make of the
fact that Butch Davis' Miami revival has been hamstrung by an 0-3
record against the Hokies?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very, very tired of hearing about it, to be honest,''
James said. ``Those games we should have won.''
</P>
<P>
   Aha, a spark of disgust. Sloppy play truly has killed Miami in
this series lately, most notably the 111 yards in penalties that
soured last year's comeback attempt at Blacksburg. Virginia Tech
won 27-25, surviving a late scare in which the Hurricanes recovered
an on-side kick but were ruled to have touched the ball before it
had traveled the required 10 yards. Maddening, it was, particularly
when the result was missing out on bowl eligibility
</P>
<P>
   From this disgust a flame of annoyance may grow and then the
righteous anger needed to send the Hurricanes charging over the top
of Hokie Hump and into the face of Florida State, which eked by
Miami 47-0 a year ago. What does center Ty Wise, one of the
toughest and strongest players on the squad, have to say about
that?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal, as a team, was to be 1-0 after the first game,''
Wise said. ``At the moment we're 2-0, and if we can beat Virginia
Tech, we'll be 3-0. Of course, we want to win the Big East, but we
really can't be looking at it any other way.''
</P>
<P>
   From mayhem to mathematics. Miami's motivation has taken the
most unexpected of turns. If the Hokies are responsible for this,
they deserve a whipping. Miami must administer one Saturday night.
Then, and only then, can the self-inflicted wounds of NCAA
probation be dismissed and genuine Hurricane healing begin.

<P>
   Ignore, please, the No. 2 national ranking, because that's
pretty much what coach Steve Spurrier is doing . . . and asking
everybody else to do, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators are 2-0, which isn't the problem. Well, kind of it
is. The victories have come against The Citadel and Northeast
Louisiana, which means they count only in a mathematical sense. The
Bulldogs and Indians, quite frankly, couldn't beat the Gators if
they ganged up and played 'em together.
</P>
<P>
   Also, it seems the Florida offense, having scored a mere 91
points, is anemic.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why it would be no surprise whatsoever to see Spurrier,
come Saturday night on the road in Neyland Stadium against
sixth-ranked Tennessee's nasties, fire up the engine on quarterback
Doug Johnson and throw him out there against the Volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Because things get serious now.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps too serious, in Spurrier's opinion, for any one
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Jesse Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer was Florida's starting quarterback in each of the
aforementioned victories. He is 34-of-59 for 593 yards and eight
touchdowns. Nice numbers. But he has made enough mistakes (three
interceptions, missed reads and missed receivers) to cause some
concern about whether he's ready for the upcoming Florida schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse's our quarterback,'' Johnson said after the most recent
Florida win, ``but Doug's healthy and ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a big but.
</P>
<P>
   It's especially big considering Spurrier's penchant for
tinkering. Remember the Johnson-Noah Brindise rotation at
quarterback during last year's victory against Florida State? Or
the Johnson-Brindise-Palmer ensemble act during the Gators' victory
against Penn State in the Citrus Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   And then there was an August conversation in Spurrier's office,
back when the Gators were still pampering Johnson in recovery from
May shoulder surgery. Spurrier, when asked if he could envision a
Palmer-Johnson tandem at quarterback, said: ``I wouldn't rule that
out.''
</P>
<P>
   What he couldn't say at the time was when he expected Johnson to
be ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   He could only hope, he said. And what he said was:
``Tennessee.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Johnson played late in the game against Northeast
Louisiana. He threw four passes and completed three. Nothing fancy,
but enough to clearly show he's available.
</P>
<P>
   And though this is not a criticism of Palmer, it's a good bet
Johnson will be needed somewhere along the line.
</P>
<P>
   Just check the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators opened with easy touches for the simplest of reasons
_ they needed practice, not peril. Not with games against Kentucky
(Tim Couch, don't laugh), 24th-ranked Alabama in Tuscaloosa,
seventh-ranked LSU, Auburn and 12th-ranked Georgia in Jacksonville
lined up in succession after Tennessee on Florida's dance card. And
there's not a week off until after the Auburn date.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a junior, and Palmer, a sophomore, long ago learned the
guiding principle of Spurrier's quarterback process. If one guy
isn't getting the job done, there's another guy he'll try.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer did get the job done against The Citadel and Northeast
Louisiana, but those eight quarters won't count for anything if his
first quarter against Tennessee isn't a productive one.
</P>
<P>
   You can take that to a checkerboard end zone.

 &HT;    Cowboys don't regret passing on Moss
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Greg Ellis or Randy Moss?
</P>
<P>
   After only two NFL games, it might be unfair to determine
whether the Dallas Cowboys made a mistake by making Ellis, a
defensive end from North Carolina, their first pick of the 1998
draft. Yet one look at TV highlights confirms that Moss, taken much
later in the first round, is quickly becoming an all-world wide
receiver in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   It's too early to tell whether Ellis is a bust, but his presence
has done little to help the Cowboys defense, which ranks 23rd in
the league and looked unusually weak in Sunday's 42-23 loss in
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The inability to contain quarterback John Elway and running back
Terrell Davis and the lack of a pass rush have alarmed Coach Chan
Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one played great,'' Gailey said recently. ``You can't say
the defense had any kind of quality performance. There were only a
few players who did all right. In general, our defense didn't do
anything we needed last week, but I still have full confidence
we'll get back this week. Our pride was hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said the Cowboys did a poor job of tackling, showing poor
technique. At times, he said, ``We tried too hard to rip off their
shoulder pads.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas finished second in the NFL in defense last season.
Through two games this season, the Cowboys rank 22nd in rushing
offense, 23rd in pass defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to put this one behind us very quickly and get ready
for the defending NFC East champion,'' said defensive coordinator
Dave Campo, referring to the game against the New York Giants. ``If
we have the pride I think we have, we'll quickly put this one
behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Deion Sanders was more specific about recent defense
lapses: ``We were confused.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Minnesota's Moss is a constant reminder that the
Cowboys passed on one of the most explosive players in the draft.
Owner Jerry Jones said Moss showed enough talent at Marshall to be
one of the top picks of the draft, but an extensive police record
scared off many teams, including the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Moss leads all rookies in catches (10), receiving yards (184)
and touchdowns (two). Furthermore, his teammates report that Moss
has been a model citizen, on and off the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the ability to be a great player in the NFL,'' Jones
said, ``but the world knew he went down to the 20th spot because of
concerns about him off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Many thought Moss would be a good fit in Dallas, which was
looking for a receiver to complement veteran Michael Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis, chosen eighth in the first round, was picked by the
Cowboys partly because his character has never been questioned. He
broke Lawrence Taylor's school record for sacks, and was considered
a leader. Also, the Cowboys needed a defensive end to replace Tony
Tolbert and Shante Carver.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis and teammate Kavika Pittman have been blamed for the
team's lack of a pass rush. The Cowboys have registered only two
quarterback sacks through two games, one by Pittman and one by
lineman Hurvin McCormack.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Randall Godfrey has 19 tackles to lead the team.
Safety Darren Woodson and linebacker Dexter Coakley are next with
14 apiece.

 &HT;    Dolphins' Surtain doesn't misplay ball, just mislays it
 &HT;    By Tom D'Angelo
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ Patrick Surtain and Sammy Sosa have something in
common.
</P>
<P>
   Neither player has the ball from the most memorable play of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Dolphins' rookie cornerback wishes he could display
the football he caught for his first interception, but Surtain was
so excited about picking off a Rob Johnson pass in the fourth
quarter of Miami's 13-7 victory over Buffalo recently that he
forgot to take the souvenir.
</P>
<P>
   Like the problem facing the Chicago Cubs' Sosa, whose 62nd
home-run ball bounced down an alley outside Wrigley Field, making
it impossible to identify, no one is certain which ball is
Surtain's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going in right now to get a ball,'' Surtain said Monday.
``I'm going to say that's the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Surtain's interception _ he tipped the ball with his left hand
as it was about to land in the arms of receiver Eric Moulds, and
made the interception as the ball came down a second time _
punctuated Surtain's breakthrough game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `You finally made a play,' '' Surtain said.
</P>
<P>
   Surtain has come a long way since struggling and losing
confidence during the pre-season. in which he says he lost
confidence. Throughout camp, Surtain looked unsure and overwhelmed.
But Coach Jimmy Johnson kept defending his second-round draft pick,
saying the Dolphins were overloading him with several assignments
in the base and nickel defenses, and even calling Surtain the most
talented rookie cornerback he's had at Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than putting him at one position and letting him just
work one thing, we felt like he could handle a lot,'' Johnson said.
``I think it's paid off for us. If we were just working him at the
corners, then we wouldn't have been able to use him (Sunday).''
</P>
<P>
   Surtain isn't used to setbacks. He was the Conference USA's
Player of the Year last season and had 12 interceptions in his last
two years at Southern Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of success is what kept him going during the
pre-season, even after he was challenged _ and beat _ on some
plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was much better than my play then,'' he said. ``(The
coaches) encouraged me because they knew I was young and they
didn't want me to go into the tank. The coaches didn't get down on
me and I like that. If you go into the tank in this league you can
get beat every week.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami's coaches didn't hesitate to press Surtain, using him in
the 45 (five defensive backs, two linebackers) and 47 (six
defensive backs, one linebacker) schemes. Secondary coach Mel
Phillips said veterans usually are given those assignments.
</P>
<P>
   So far Surtain has been used only in nickel packages because the
Dolphins have enough veteran corners.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could play right now,'' Phillips said of possibly using
Surtain at cornerback. ``He's a play-maker. But it's a matter of
putting a rookie in there and them saying, `Go after him.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson compares Surtain to Sam Madison, a second-round pick
last season. As a rookie, Madison played in the nickel package and
improved enough to start three games late in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam Madison played good toward the end of the year last year,
but nowhere close to where he is playing right now,'' Johnson said.
``Patrick is just a young guy. He's going to be a good cornerback
in this league. And we've got confidence that if something happened
to one of the corners, he could play corner.

 &HT;    Mismatches have been Solheim Cup's misfortune
 &HT;    By Craig Dolch
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   To the ardent golf fan, the Solheim Cup is slowly becoming one
of the sport's premier events. But the response of most casual
golfers to the Solheim is still, ``So what?''
</P>
<P>
   After four competitions, the Solheim, the LPGA's version of the
Ryder Cup, has failed to capture the public's interest because,
well, there hasn't been much competition. The United States has
thoroughly beaten Europe three of four times, and Europe's lone
victory came in ho-hum fashion.
</P>
<P>
   But if a nail-biting, grip-clinching, choke-your-guts-out type
of finish _ maybe even with a little trash talking _ is what the
Solheim Cup's organizers need, they just may have come to the right
place.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicklaus' Muirfield Village course in Dublin, Ohio, already
has been the setting for one of the most dramatic events in recent
international golf history. In the 1987 Ryder Cup matches, an
underdog Europe team came to Muirfield and shocked the Americans,
handing captain Jack and his team its first loss on home soil.
</P>
<P>
   The Ryder Cup has never been the same since. Thanks largely to
Europe winning three of the next five matches, the Ryder Cup has
become one of sports' _ not just golf's _ most pressure-packed
events.
</P>
<P>
   The Solheim Cup participants, particularly the Europeans, can
only hope that happens again this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, playing at Muirfield Village feels good because of
what happened to the Americans there in 1987,'' Europe captain Pia
Nilsson said. ``Our players are very aware of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet many believe Europe doesn't need to rely on history to win
the Solheim Cup for the first time since 1992. If you think
European players aren't on par with the Americans, look at last
week's Safeco Classic. Sweden's Annika Sorenstam won it; England's
Laura Davies finished second.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has to make us feel better about our chances,'' said
Sorenstam, who became the LPGA's money leader after winning her
fourth title of the year. ``You always want to play well the week
before the Solheim.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam heads a team that is being hailed as the strongest
European side ever assembled. It is talented (Sorenstam, Boca
Raton's Liselotte Neumann and Helen Alfredsson are among five women
who have won multiple events this year) and experienced (Neumann,
Alfredsson, Davies, Alison Nicholas and Trish Johnson have never
missed a Solheim Cup).
</P>
<P>
   American captain Judy Rankin, who directed her team's 17-11
victory in Wales in 1996, has listened to the underdog talk most of
the summer. She says it doesn't bother her, but that doesn't mean
she agrees with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were the underdog last time, and we hold the
Cup,'' Rankin said. ``Don't forget that; we own it. I don't know if
this can be more evenly matched.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be a lot more unevenly matched if the eligibility
rules, which currently restrict the competition to players born in
the U.S. and Europe, were expanded to include the rest of the
world. The Nos. 2 and 5 players on the LPGA Tour money list,
Korea's Se Ri Pak and Australia's Karrie Webb, are not eligible.
</P>
<P>
   The Ryder Cup used to have a similar problem. Conceived as a
U.S.-vs.-Great Britain and Ireland competition, it was expanded to
include the rest of Europe. But that still left out many of the
world's top players, including Greg Norman (Australia), Ernie Els
(South Africa) and Nick Price (Zimbabwe). The answer was the
Presidents Cup, a match staged every off-Ryder year between the
United States and non-European countries.
</P>
<P>
   On the women's side, however, there's not enough worldwide depth
of talent to add another event. Some have suggested the Solheim Cup
simply be expanded to a U.S.-vs.-the world format. Having started
only in 1990, the Solheim isn't as bound by tradition as the Ryder
Cup, which dates back to 1927.
</P>
<P>
   LPGA Commissioner Jim Ritts has named a committee to look into
new proposals, but a change doesn't seem imminent. John Solheim,
whose father, Karsten, put up the money to start the matches, said
his family prefers the current format. So do most of the Americans
and virtually all the Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we need to change anything because I think that
would take away from what the Solheim Cup is beginning to be,''
Alfredsson said. ``Obviously, it's sad that some of the best
players don't belong to a team, but the Solheim Cup should stay the
way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   There's one change everyone would endorse, though _ a close
match. After four blowouts, maybe this will be the Solheim that's
good till the last putt drops.

 &HT;    Panthers' McLean dealing with not being No. 1
 &HT;    By Brian Biggane
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNRISE, Fla. _ The Florida Panthers' franchise-record losing
streak was at 12 when General Manager Bryan Murray made a seemingly
minor deal to acquire goaltender Kirk McLean last March 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, I seriously wondered if we would win another
game,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   Three nights later, the slide ended at 13 games as McLean,
making his first start as a Panther, backstopped a 5-4 victory
against Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   McLean finished 4-2-1 in seven appearances. So how did Murray
reward him? He spent the whole summer conducting a goalie search
that ended with the free-agent signing of Sean Burke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hear much about what was going on,'' said McLean, 32,
who spent the summer in Vancouver, where he started for the Canucks
for more than 10 seasons before being traded to Carolina early last
season. ``Maybe it was good I was so far away.''
</P>
<P>
   Now McLean is hearing he might be on the trading block again if
Kevin Weekes ends his holdout in time to make an impression in
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this stage of the season, nothing is etched in stone,''
McLean said. ``I'll be a free agent next year, and if they want to
do something, that's a business decision. All I can do is go out
and play hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   McLean wants it known he's delighted to be a Panther. In
Vancouver the past few years, he said too many selfish superstars
consistently ruined any chance the Canucks had to play as a team.
And his brief stay in Carolina left a lot to be desired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carolina did me a favor getting me out of Vancouver,'' he
said. ``They've had major internal problems there, and it
definitely wasn't fun. Guys were going through the motions, and it
wears on you.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Carolina, while I enjoyed the players, I didn't feel
comfortable in the whole setting. So the whole summer was kind of a
`pinch-me' situation.''
</P>
<P>
   While his brother conducted the search that ended in Burke's
signing, first-year coach Terry Murray made it clear he would have
had no problems with McLean as his starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've liked Kirk as a goaltender,'' he said. ``He's played very
well. Everybody has ups and downs and off times, but he's put up
some pretty good numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   McLean has known Burke since the two played junior against one
another in the mid-'80s; in fact, they spent the 1986-87 season in
the New Jersey organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see no reason we can't work together well,'' McLean said.
``We play the same kind of style, and have the same kind of
philosophy.''

 &HT;    Student forced to lie beneath sink sueing Florida school board
 &HT;    By Stephanie Desmon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A 15-year-old freshman forced to spend hours curled up
underneath a sink in a Spanish River High School in-school
suspension room is suing the Palm Beach County School Board and the
teacher and principal who oversaw the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   The student, identified only as CTH, had his civil rights
violated and ``suffered severe humiliation, embarrassment and loss
of liberty,'' according to federal court papers filed Aug. 31 and
served to the school district recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those stories that if you tell anybody about it,
their jaws drop,'' said Rosemarie Richard, the Stuart attorney
representing the student and his parents. ``You would think that
shouldn't happen in a public school in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   School district general counsel Cynthia Prettyman said she has
read the suit and is looking for the appropriate attorney to
represent the district. Former teacher Jeff Tytler, also named in
the suit, could not be reached Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Former principal Art Johnson, also named in the suit, said: ``No
student was ever mistreated at Spanish River High School. And I
have to question the timing and the motivation of a suit at this
time.'' Johnson is a candidate in the Nov. 3 school board race.
Tytler and Johnson were let go after the school system discovered
Tytler's militaristic classroom last summer. Both have sued the
school district.
</P>
<P>
   Kids were sent to Tytler's room when they were suspended for
offenses such as fighting. It was supposed to be a place to
complete assignments, rather than serve suspensions at home.
</P>
<P>
   But Tytler, who ran the class from 1993 until he was let go in
1997, had his own codes. The walls of the room were covered with
graphic drawings. He sentenced misbehaving students to spend time
in a confined space under a sink _ which he dubbed the ``slackers
box.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the suit, CTH, now 16 and no longer in public
school, was sent to Tytler's room in October 1996 _ and five more
times over the next nine months.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Tytler forced him to stay in the box for four straight
hours, the suit claims. ``Tytler somehow became aware that CTH was
dozing off and grabbed a baseball bat, which he beat on the sink
above CTH's head repeatedly,'' the suit alleges. ``The vibrating
sink sent shock waves throughout CTH's body.''
</P>
<P>
   The family is seeking an unspecified amount of money.

 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ During the 1996 presidential campaign, San
Antonio teacher Trish Duncan told her elementary school students
that ``character counts.'' Faced with the furor over President
Clinton's affair with a White House intern, Duncan on Tuesday,
September 15, asked the man who lost that race, former Sen. Robert
Dole, for an explanation to take back to class.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to tell them that honesty and integrity are
important,'' Dole said, sounding a theme that dominated his speech
to about 2,700 at Trinity University in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Dole refrained from criticizing Clinton directly _ ``I didn't
lose the election to become a Clinton critic,'' he said to applause
_ but his roughly half-hour address focused on character and
leadership. Many audience members, however, seemed to have a
difficult time separating that theme from the situation in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess timing is everything,'' Dole quipped as the crowd rose
to applaud his entrance. ``I didn't know this was going to happen _
don't blame me.''
</P>
<P>
   A relaxed Dole wandered comfortably away from the lectern and
launched numerous one-liners, most of which hit their mark with the
tie-clad College Republicans as well as the diverse crowd of
Trinity students.
</P>
<P>
   Dole spent much of his speech talking about President Dwight D.
Eisenhower, a man he described as his hero. The statement that
General Eisenhower drafted in case the D-Day invasion failed
defined leadership, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt, it is mine
alone,'' Dole quoted from the statement. ``That's accountability.
And that's what great leaders do. They face the facts without
flinching. They don't pass it on to somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole, a World War II veteran who was disabled in combat, added
that ``duty, honor and country'' are ideals that will endure. In
the midst of the crisis in Washington, the crowd devoured his
words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those values may be underutilized, but they're ageless,'' Dole
said.

 &HT;    Flashy intro should have been a clue
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The reason the president ought to step down?
</P>
<P>
   It's because he was stupid enough to get involved with a woman
who introduced herself to him by showing off the straps of her
undies.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, she was young. So maybe that's what Monica Lewinsky
thought they meant when they talked about ``briefing'' the
president.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Starr report, nearly three years ago, upon
meeting the president in the chief of staff's office, Lewinsky
lifted her jacket in the back to show the president the straps of
her thong underwear.
</P>
<P>
   I have seen barroom fights, judged chili cookoffs, attended a
dogfight, and even visited the state Legislature while it was in
session.
</P>
<P>
   But outside of a topless bar, I have never once seen a woman
introduce herself in the workplace by showing off her underwear.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is because Miss Manners doesn't recommend this
maneuver as a proper method of introduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't usually teach that in my etiquette classes,'' said
Susan Kaiwi, of the Etiquette School of Austin. ``Such an
introduction I have not heard of until now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not in any etiquette book,'' added Margaret Parker, of
the Austin Party Service, who used to teach etiquette to sorority
gals at the University of Texas. ``I don't think that's polite.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker joked this might be an acceptable form of introducing
yourself in Aggieland. Actually, though, Aggie-style is different.
</P>
<P>
   Aggie-style is when you wear your underwear over your pants.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, when the president saw those thong straps, he should
have realized he was dealing with a goofball. So instead of
starting a relationship, he should have tossed cold water on it by
saying: ``I see London; I see France. I see someone's underpants.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, what's the president of the U.S. doing hanging out with
a gal who goes around with her underwear hanging out? This is not
the kind of gal you want to introduce to the Jamaican ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   Unless he's single.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, I've worked for years around female interns such as
Lewinsky. And never once has one of them walked up to me at the
office and said, ``Mr. Kelso, I just wanted to say hidy. And while
we're at it, get a load of these drawers.''
</P>
<P>
   But if someone did that, I might suspect something was, you
know, amiss. And you'd think the president would be at least that
smart.
</P>
<P>
   Now, you might make the case that the president finds flashing
one's underwear an acceptable form of greeting because he's from
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   After all, in Arkansas, instead of beginning a conversation
with, ``May I have this dance?'' you break the ice by asking, ``How
about these underpants?''
</P>
<P>
   But regardless of upbringing, you'd think the president would be
a little pickier.
</P>
<P>
   He should have known better. The president should have grabbed
that strap back, let her rip, and shot her over into the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Forget Victoria's Secret. Someone call the Secret Service.

 &HT;    New test allows murder charges after 14 years
 &HT;    By Bob Banta
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A new DNA testing procedure that has been used
for barely two weeks by Texas authorities resulted in charges being
filed against an Austin man police say raped and killed a secretary
14 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said they believe the 1984 slaying of Lauren Marie
McCarty is the first homicide in Texas solved by an updated process
that matches genetic blueprints found in human cells from tiny
amounts of blood, saliva, semen, skin or hair samples.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never stop investigating a homicide, no matter how old it
is,'' Austin Police Lt. David Parkinson said Tuesday. ``This is a
case where technology finally caught up with a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Alan Woods, 42, was being held in a Travis County jail
without bond Tuesday, facing charges of capital murder in the death
and sexual assault of McCarty.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old secretary was found beaten to death in her car
behind Westgate Mall in South Austin on Dec. 22, 1984, five days
after she was reported missing. McCarty was last seen when she left
her job at the Texas Municipal Court Training Center to run an
errand during lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Her family in Lubbock had expected her home for the Christmas
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Police said that, on the basis of other evidence, Woods was a
suspect in the murder shortly after it occurred.
</P>
<P>
   In the months after McCarty's slaying, according to news
accounts of the incident, police took blood, saliva and hair
samples from the suspect, but lab tests were inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just wasn't much there,'' said Parkinson, who was in
charge of the case, in a Feb. 18, 1985, interview in the Austin
American-Statesman.
</P>
<P>
   But the samples gathered 14 years ago were stored by authorities
in anticipation that developments in forensic analysis would give
them the scientific evidence they needed in court.
</P>
<P>
   Those hopes were realized two weeks ago, when the Texas
Department of Public Safety purchased 10 new genetic analyzers at a
total cost of $780,000.
</P>
<P>
   Austin Police Detective Paul Johnson, who had been assigned to
review the McCarty case, decided to have the samples taken from
Woods re-examined.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Woods served 12 years of a 15-year term in state
prison, beginning in 1986, on another sexual assault charge. He
said Woods was released earlier this year but was recently sent
back to jail on another case.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had the 14-year-old samples ago retested using the
genetic analyzers.
</P>
<P>
   In an arrest affidavit for Woods, filed Monday in Municipal
Court, the detective said DPS lab technician Jodie Williams called
him Sept. 9 and reported that the state lab had matched samples
from the McCarty case to Woods. The likelihood that the samples
could match someone else is 1 in 16,000, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Irma Rios, supervisor of DNA testing at DPS, said the testing
procedure with the new equipment allows accurate profiling of a
person's DNA from samples no larger than the head of a pin.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier testing procedures required samples at least as large as
a dime, said Rios. DNA _ an abbreviation for deoxyribonucleic acid
_ is an essential ingredient in human cells.
</P>
<P>
   The new tests involve exposing fragments of the genetic material
to an electrical current that sorts them by size.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic ``probes'' lock onto various parts of the DNA, according
to Rios.
</P>
<P>
   Resulting patterns can be compared, allowing samples found at a
crime scene and samples taken from a suspect to be matched.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Clinton stuns pundits, keeps approval rate high
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ ``The president's got this tiny, little ground to
argue from now. He can't have his supporters argue that his actions
were moral. He can't even have them argue that they were
necessarily legal. All they have left is that the punishment
doesn't fit the crime.''
</P>
<P>
   This analysis of the president's situation came from George
Stephanopoulos, Clinton's longtime senior political adviser who now
is paid to provide political analysis for ABC News.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanopoulos made this observation to Ted Koppel on the ABC
News Nightline program Thursday night before Congress made a
portion the independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report public.
</P>
<P>
   What the White House fears most Stephanopoulos said, was that
Democratic senators especially, but also House members, would read
the report over the weekend, see the polls drop a little and then
rush to judgment _ the president has to go; they can't carry him
into an election.
</P>
<P>
   Since Stephanopoulos made those remarks, the Starr report was
posted on the Internet, published in newspapers and read by
millions of people worldwide. The weekend came and went. As it
turned out, the White House had nothing to fear.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday, Clinton's job approval ratings on various polls went
up from 60 percent to 64 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night's Nightline, guest anchor Forrest Sawyer said a
new ABC poll showed 64 percent of Americans believe the Lewinsky
scandal has nothing to do with Clinton doing his job as president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I notice that a lot of pundits are stunned by this,''
Sawyer said. ``Nothing that happens seems to affect these
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   If Stephanopoulos is right that the president has lost the moral
issue and lost the legal issue, then who wouldn't be stunned to see
the man's job approval rating go up after the release of the Starr
report?
</P>
<P>
   It's not complete true that Clinton has lost the legal issue.
Clinton's lawyers were on the Sunday news shows using
hair-splitting arguments that their client did not lie under oath
in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit or under oath to the
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The same leading Democrats that Stephanopoulos said the White
House most feared have advised Clinton that these tortured legal
arguments will not work in Congress, including with Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Now Stephanopoulos worries that the good public opinion polls
will embolden Clinton to stick with his hair-splitting legalities
despite good advice from his advisors and Democratic minority
leaders in the Senate and House. This could cause Democrats to turn
against him, which would seal his fate.
</P>
<P>
   But I don't think so. If Clinton can continue to stun the
pundits by keeping his job approval ratings sky high, he will
escape all but unscathed from the Starr report on the Lewinsky
sexcapade.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the impeachment process is a purposeful mixture
of the political and the judicial. Politically, Congress could not
remove from office a properly elected president who enjoys strong
popular support of the American people despite evidence that might
cause the removal of an unpopular president.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Gerald Ford was right when he said impeachment
is whatever Congress says it is.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's current hair-splitting strategy is designed to keep
him out of jail once he leaves office. He could be prosecuted for
lying to a federal judge and to a grand jury. An admission that he
lied in the Paula Jones case also could re-open that case.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanopoulos believes Clinton's best option is a
``censure-plus'' deal with Congress. But he probably couldn't get
even congressional Democrats to go along with that deal unless he
drops his legal strategy that no one believes, except perhaps the
public.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may be smarter than all the pundits and all the members
of Congress. If the public supports him no matter what, Clinton
wins. History will determine if the country wins.

 &HT;    Premieres don't worry Paxson
 &HT;    By Marguerite M. Plunkett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   While all the other networks will be airing new weeknight shows
next week, PAX TV will be showing reruns.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone considers that to be a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to raise our ratings because they have terrible
programs,'' Paxson Chairman Lowell ``Bud'' Paxson said of offerings
on NBC, CBS, ABC and other networks.
</P>
<P>
   PAX, the nation's seventh commercial network, launched on Aug.
31, just three weeks before the networks premiere most of their new
fall shows the week of Sept. 21.
</P>
<P>
   PAX's weeknight, prime-time lineup is based on family-friendly
programming, including reruns of Touched by an Angel and Diagnosis
Murder. On Saturday night, PAX offers original programming, such as
Flipper: The New Adventures and Neon Rider.
</P>
<P>
   While the West Palm Beach-based PAX network might be ``lost in
the shuffle'' of new fall shows, it probably won't suffer in the
long run, said New York media buyer Paul Schulman, who has an
office in Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the smoke clears and the season is under way, they
should just continue to stress the clean family programming they're
going to be televising,'' Schulman said. ``A lot of shows are being
heavily promoted that aren't that good.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Sohmer, Paxson's promotions head, said, ``Although the
networks haven't launched, they've begun to play original programs
again. People are going to shop around and sample'' TV shows. ``We
will be able to maintain our ratings and come through this launch
quite well.''
</P>
<P>
   Paxson also is counting on programming consistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the ratings will bounce around a little bit,'' Sohmer
said. ``But the magic of this consistent prime-time lineup is that
folks who come in and watch us on Monday night are very likely to
come watch us on Tuesday. That's not the case for any other
network.''
</P>
<P>
   Paxson (AMEX: PAX, $9.88) broadcasts on 95 owned, operated or
affiliated stations in markets with more than 76 million TV
households. It airs on WPXP-Channel 67 in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The company will continue to promote PAX as it has since the
launch, including ads on radio and in TV publications, as well as
in-house promotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be some erosion, but again Paxson is so new you
can't find a trend line,'' said Bishop Cheen, analyst at First
Union Capital Markets Group in Charlotte, N.C, adding that the new
fall shows are not that strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen stronger,'' he said. ``They may start doing laps on
the remote control.''

 &HT;    Fla. may get more tobacco money
 &HT;    By Scott Hiaasen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   While counting the $165 million collected recently from
cigarette companies, state officials said they expect to soon reach
an agreement that would boost Florida's take in the tobacco lawsuit
by another $1.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Florida officials have been negotiating with the tobacco
industry for months to increase the $11 billion settlement under a
clause that allows the state to reap the benefits of future
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Bob Butterworth has said he believes the state
should get $1.7 billion more based on the scale used in Minnesota's
tobacco lawsuit, settled in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very optimistic that we will be reaching an agreement
soon, hopefully within a couple of days,'' said Edie Ousley, a
spokeswoman for Gov. Lawton Chiles.
</P>
<P>
   The new agreement also would place more restrictions on
marketing by cigarette makers, outlawing the sale of T-shirts,
backpacks, hats, gym bags or other goods bearing cigarette brand
names, Ousley said.
</P>
<P>
   The original settlement, signed in August 1997, prohibited
cigarette billboards and transit advertisements, and limited
vending machine sales.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Duchesne, a spokesman for the tobacco industry, would not
comment.
</P>
<P>
   One sticking point in the negotiations over the $1.7 billion is
whether that money would go specifically to repaying Medicaid
costs. If that were the case, state officials worried, much of the
money could be appropriated by the federal government, which pays
55 percent of the state's Medicaid costs.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the state recently collected its first annual installment
from cigarette makers as part of the settlement reached in August
1997. The industry was scheduled to pay $165 million into the state
treasury, and another $55 million to the Palm Beach County Circuit
Court, where it will be held until a dispute over the attorneys'
fees is resolved. For several lawyers that could be this week.
</P>
<P>
   So far, $970 million has been paid to the state as part of the
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   More than $250 million is sitting in the court registry, held
there for the trial lawyers who are seeking 25 percent of the
settlement money under a fee contract.
</P>
<P>
   All but three of the trial lawyers are expected this week to
agree to accept a $100 million advance and have the rest of their
fees determined in November by a panel of arbitrators _ not unlike
the fee arrangement the state worked out with the tobacco industry
in the August settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a really good compromise,'' said W.C. Gentry, one
of the trial lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Montgomery, the West Palm Beach trial lawyer who has been
one of the most adamant against arbitration, said he won't sign any
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still say we have a contract, and we expect the state to
live up to the contract,'' he said.

 2-COX &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette

<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED: Q: I understand that President Clinton was nominated
for the Nobel Peace Prize, yet I've seen nothing in the media about
it. Is it true?
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do the letters KLM stand for in the name of the Dutch
airline?
</P>
<P>
   A: Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij (Royal Airline Co.)
</P>
<P>
   Q: Someone recently mentioned the ``harvest moon,'' but didn't
say when it would be, or where it gets that name. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's the full moon nearest the autumnal equinox. It generally
ushers in a period of several successive days when the moon rises
soon after sunset, giving farmers in temperate latitudes extra
hours of light in which to harvest their crops before frost and
winter come. The 1998 harvest moon has just occurred, said David
Dundee, astronomer at Fernbank Science Center. It was Sept. 6. The
next full moon, called the hunter's moon, will fall on Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Some people think the harvest moon is larger than normal, Dundee
said, but it's an optical illusion occuring because the angle at
which the harvest moon rises from the horizon is at its most
oblique. The eye and brain, viewing and interpreting the moon in
the context of buildings and trees which are at a greater distance,
translate the image and see a moon that appears larger than usual.
But, of course, the harvest moon is the same size as any other full
moon.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard a broadcaster say recently that NASA scientists had
evidence that there was a second eye within Hurricane Bonnie,
indicating that it was, in essence, a ``pregnant hurricane.'' Is
that possible? I never heard of such a thing.
</P>
<P>
   A: Neither has the National Hurricane Center in Miami. That
report most likely was hyperbole, said the center's Frank Lepore.
There are occasions when a hurricane has concentric eye walls, but
it's not a second eye, and it wouldn't cause a subsequent hurricane
to be spun off.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest part of a hurricane is an area right around the
eye, called the eye wall, Lepore explained. It's a warm core center
where the fastest winds are located. There are essentially bands of
thunderstorms wrapped around the eye, and if two such bands exist,
with a space between them, the hurricane would have a double eye
wall. But that couldn't be termed a second eye, and it wouldn't
make a hurricane ``pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've often heard of the 1940s blacklist of supposed
Communists in Hollywood. Were any of those people identified
publicly?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Nine writers and one director who refused to cooperate
with the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1947 were
imprisoned for up to a year for being ``unfriendly witnesses.''
They were Alvah Bessie, Herbert Biberman, Lester Cole, Edward
Dmytryk, Ring Lardner Jr., John Howard Lawson, Albert Maltz, Samuel
Ornitz, Adrian Scott and Dalton Trumbo.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the case of an airliner disabled over water, like the
Swissair MD-11that crashed recently, would it be possible for
pilots to glide it, or land it under power, on the ocean surface?
</P>
<P>
   A: In interviews after the Sept. 2 crash of Swissair Flight 111,
pilots have speculated that in attempting to ditch a plane, the
preferred method would be to keep the engines running and to
approach the water at speeds of about 150 miles an hour, with the
nose of the plane slightly higher than normal so the tail would
touch the surface first. With luck, they said, the plane would act
somewhat like a skipping stone before settling gently into the
water.
</P>
<P>
   But that is based on computer simulations and engineering
calculations. For obvious reasons, ditching can't be practiced, and
pilots who have spoken on the subject said it's not part of their
training on simulators.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent attempt of a pilot trying to land an airliner in
water occurred in November 1996 off the Comoros islands in the
Indian Ocean. A hijacked Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 767, which had
run out of fuel, apparently was attempting to come in for a
daylight landing on relatively calm seas when a wing-tip dipped,
caught the water, and the plane cartwheeled and broke into several
pieces. Of the 175 people on board, only 52 survived.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How old was Roger Maris when he when he died, and what was
the cause of death?
</P>
<P>
   A: He was 51 when he died Dec. 14, 1985, after a two-year battle
with lymphatic cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it true that Hillary Rodham Clinton helped write the
articles of impeachment to be used when President Richard Nixon was
facing possible impeachment?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's true. As has been widely reported for many years,
Hillary Rodham, who graduated from Yale Law School in 1973, joined
the impeachment inquiry staff of the House Judiciary Committee in
January 1974 as a low-level attorney. Her work with the committee
led to several prestigious job offers after Nixon's resignation,
but she decided to move later that same year to Fayetteville, Ark.,
to teach law at the University of Arkansas and to be near Bill
Clinton. They were married in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How long has the company Gap been in business? What is the
origin of the name?
</P>
<P>
   A: Gap founder Don Fisher, a San Francisco real estate
developer, opened the first Gap store in 1969 on Ocean Avenue in
San Francisco. He had been trying to exchange a pair of jeans, and
after visiting store after store, noticed that jeans departments
were disorganized, poorly stocked and difficult to shop. So he and
his wife, Doris, created a jeans store neatly organized by size.
The store, which also sold records, was named after a cultural
phenomenon that was the talk of the times: the Generation Gap. As
the chain grew, it also began selling other merchandise, and in1974
began creating its own private-label clothing and accessories. In
1991, Gap announced that by year-end everything it sold would be
under the company's own label.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know about the bunker at the Greenbrier Hotel in West
Virginia built decades ago to protect goverment officials in case
of war, but I recently heard about another one somewhere else. Do
you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: You may be referring to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency's bunker inside Mount Weather near Berryville, Va., about 50
miles from Washington. It wasn't intended to house government
officials in case of an attack on Washington, like the secret,
fortified building at the Greenbrier Hotel in White Sulphur
Springs, W.Va., built under orders by President Dwight Eisenhower.
Instead, what FEMA called its ``special facility'' is the hub for
much of the agency's classified communication. It's still in use,
but has been supplemented by Mobile Emergency Response Support
units, developed during President Ronald Reagan's administration
because of concerns that increasingly accurate and powerful nuclear
weapons could wipe out Mount Weather.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors also have it that a bunker to house government officials
has been constructed beneath a new FBI building at Clarksburg,
W.Va., but for obvious reasons, details are scant.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What can you tell us about the famous Japanese home run king,
Mr. Oh? Is he still playing?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sadaharu Oh hit more home runs _ 868 _ than anyone else in
Japanese or American professional baseball history in the 22 years
before he retired from the Tokyo Yomiuri Giants in 1980. At the end
of his career, he also had recorded 2,786 hits; 2,170 runs batted
in; and a .301 batting average out of 9,250 at-bats in 2,831 games.
Oh, born in 1940 in Tokyo, still holds the record for more runs
batted in than any other batter in Japanese professional baseball.
Famous for his ``flamingo'' hitting form with one leg off the
ground, Oh was awarded Japan's first National Medal of Honor when
he surpassed Hank Aaron's home run record of 756 in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Oh credited several things for his success. He was known to
drink a secret blend of ginseng tea, a traditional Asian brew for
energy. And Hiroshi Arakawa, Oh's batting coach, and Oh spent three
years training with the founder of the martial art of aikido, where
the concept of extending one's spirit, called ki, is the source of
physical power.
</P>
<P>
   But there's an asterisk involved in comparing American baseball
to that played in Japan. Japanese fences are shorter, 300 feet down
the line. In the United States, the norm is a distance of 325 feet
or more down the foul lines to the fence and rounding out to 400
feet or more in straightaway center field. The Japanese also play
with a smaller ball.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When investigators recover flight data recorders from an
aircraft accident, such as TWA 800 and Swissair 111, they're put
into a cooler with water in it. Why is this done?
</P>
<P>
   A: After the recorders have been recovered from being in ocean
water, they're put into fresh water to wash the salts off, said
Preston Hicks of the National Transportation Safety Board. It's a
measure intended to preserve the recorders. The water also keeps
air away from them, inhibiting the onset of corrosion, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In a live interview on CNN recently, and in a photo in the
newspaper, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi appeared to be seated in a
motorized wheelchair. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: Gadhafi's appearance in a mechanized wheelchair reignited
interest in reports that his motorcade had been shot at by an
Islamic group near the eastern Libya city of Beida a few months
ago, but in the Aug. 27 interview, he said he had broken his left
leg when he fell ``while taking part in sports.'' Other published
reports said he underwent hip surgery in July. The day after the
surgery, film of the operation was said to have been broadcast by
Libyan television.
</P>
<P>
   Gadhafi, 56, resumed normal work a few days later, and was
undergoing physical therapy, according to the Libyan news agency
JANA.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his wheelchair and his condition, Gadhafi told CNN
that he was feeling fine. He laughed, shifted in his chair _
apparently to show his flexibility _ and said the interview should
move on to more serious subjects. As he spoke, his left hand
tightly gripped a movable handle on the wheelchair, suggesting he
might have had to hold on in order to keep his hand from flailing
about.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm confused. I often see airplane passengers using on-board
telephones, but Q&AMP;A said recently that cell phones are prohibited.
Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: The on-board public telephones, generally inset into the
seatback in front of a passenger, are of a type whose emissions
have been carefully evaluated and found not to be a threat to the
aircraft's navigational and electrical systems, said Delta
spokesman Bill Berry. The use of cell phones that a passenger
brings on board are banned because the phones might emit signals
that could cause interference problems.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is Jerry Lewis compensated for his annual Labor Day telethon?
</P>
<P>
   A: He isn't paid. As he has done for many years, Lewis
volunteers his services for the Muscular Dystrophy Association
fund-raiser, which this year netted a record $51,577,023 in
pledges.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On the back of a $1 bill, there's a pyramid with an eye at
the top. What's the significance?
</P>
<P>
   A: The most accurate explanation of a pyramid on the Great Seal
of the United States is that it symbolizes strength and durability,
according to the State Department. The unfinished pyramid means
that the United States will always grow, improve and build. In
addition, the ``All-Seeing Eye'' above the pyramid suggests the
importance of divine guidance in favor of the American cause.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: Given all of the strong shifts in the stock market recently,
how many dollars are gained or lost in stocks for every 100-point
move in the Dow Jones Industrial Average?
</P>
<P>
   A: In terms of dollars lost, investors took their worst hit ever
this past Aug. 31, when the value of all U.S. stocks dropped by
roughly $630 billion, said Myrone Greene, Georgia State University
business professor emeritus and publisher of the Mutual Fund Timing
Guide. On that day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 512
points, so 100 points was equivalent to about $123 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently watched a series on TV about the Holocaust. I'm
confused about the SS and the Gestapo. What do the letters SS stand
for? How does one relate to the other? Of the two, which was the
worst?
</P>
<P>
   A: SS is an abbreviation of Schutzstaffel, meaning ``protective
echelon'' in German. The Gestapo, an abbreviation of Geheime
Staats-Polizei (meaning ``secret state police''), was part of it.
Both had similar aims and overlapping functions.
</P>
<P>
   The SS, the black-uniformed elite corps of the Nazi Party, was
founded by Adolf Hitler in1925 as a small, personal bodyguard. By
the time the Nazis came to power in 1933, it had grown under
Heinrich Himmler to more than 50,000 members; by 1939, it was a
massive and labyrinthian bureaucracy numbering 250,000. The SS was
divided mainly into two groups, the Allgemeine-SS (General SS) and
the Waffen-SS (Armed SS). The most important division within the
General SS was the Reich Security Central Office, made up of the
Order Police and the Security Police. In turn, the Security Police
was divided into the Criminal Police and the Gestapo.
</P>
<P>
   The Gestapo's ruthless methods of capture, torture and
extermination; the fact that it was responsible for all
concentration camps; and its exemption from any control by the
courts made it a symbol for brutal, sadistic repression. After the
defeat of Nazi Germany by the Allies, the SS and the Gestapo were
formally declared criminal organizations by the Allied Tribunal in
Nuremberg in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Both the SS and the Gestapo were powerful, deadly and much
dreaded, so it's hard to say which was the more evil. A case could
be made for either one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: While shopping at a department store recently, a woman, upon
payment of her purchases, presented the clerk with what she called
a ``tax-exempt card.'' Who issues these cards, and who qualifies
for them?
</P>
<P>
   A: Tax-exempt identification cards are issued by the State
Department to foreign consulates and eligible foreign diplomats.
The tax exemption is granted as a part of several foreign treaties
and extends to all types of tax, not just sales tax. U.S. diplomats
and consulates enjoy the same exemption in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Scenes in ``Saving Private Ryan'' depicting the D-Day
invasion at Omaha Beach actually were filmed in Ireland. But were
the opening and closing scenes at a cemetery filmed in Normandy?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, at the Normandy American Cemetery on a cliff overlooking
Omaha Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is the video version of ``Titanic'' doing in sales and
rentals?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's sinking all competitors, just like it did on the big
screen for so long. ``Titanic'' has been out on video only since
Sept. 1. A spokeswoman at VideoScan in Los Angeles estimated that
as of Sept. 6, ``Titanic'' video sales at more than 15 million
copies, based on sales of 6 million alone tracked by VideoScan,
which represents about 40 percent of the total market. A spokesman
at the Video Software Dealers Association in Los Angeles said
nationwide rentals for the period ending Sept. 6 totaled about
$8.46 million.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read about a $10,000 Federal Reserve note, but since I'm
never likely to see one, I am curious: Whose picture was on it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Salmon P. Chase (Treasury secretary, 1861-64).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some time ago, it was reported that scientists aboard an
aircraft were experimenting with releasing chemicals into the
center of a hurricane to see if it could cause the storm to
disperse. Whatever became of that?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're referring to Operation Stormfury. Scientists conducted
experiments seeding clouds with silver iodine crystals, said Frank
Lepore of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. The experiments
were done with hurricanes Esther (1961), Beulah (1963), Debbie
(1969) and Ginger (1971) when they were over the Atlantic far from
land.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists targeted convective clouds just outside the eye
wall in an attempt to form a new ring of clouds that, it was hoped,
would compete with the natural circulation of the storm and weaken
it. That didn't happen, for reasons that weren't confirmed until
the 1980s, Lepore said. For cloud seeding to be successful, the
clouds must contain supercool water, colder than freezing, but not
yet ice. Most hurricanes don't have enough such cold water, so the
experiments were termed a failure.
</P>
<P>
   The National Academy of Science has since concluded that more
complete understanding of the physical processes of a hurricane is
needed before undertaking any more ``modification experiments,'' so
Operation Stormfury and any other such projects were discontinued
in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When will the next total eclipse occur?
</P>
<P>
   A: It will be a solar eclipse on Aug. 11, 1999, and will be
visible in Europe, the Middle East and India.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that a luxury ship is under construction, and
the cabins will be sold like condominiums. It will sail all over
the world. Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: A company registered in the Bahamas is proposing such a
concept. At the moment, the vessel, to be called The World of
ResidenSea, exists only as a brass model, glossy brochures and a
video, but ResidenSea Ltd. officials claim to have sold 62 units
worth almost $120 million, according to Business Week. Brochures
say the 86,000-ton, 958-foot-long ship will be composed of units
costing between $1.5 million and $6.6 million. Annual maintenance
fees also will be high: $61,500 for a 1,105-square-foot unit,
$271,800 for a 2,436-square-foot version.
</P>
<P>
   ResidenSea is the brainchild of Knut Kloster Jr., whose father
founded Norwegian Caribbean Line, which later became Norwegian
Cruise Line.
</P>
<P>
   While the concept resembles a floating condo, residents won't
really own their homes like condo owners do, Business Week said.
The company structured documents to resemble condo agreements, but
residents actually would be buying a 50-year lease. In addition to
the leased units, ResidenSea will rent out 183 guest suites on the
ship.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have read that a player in the Negro Baseball Leagues hit
more than 80 home runs in one season. Can you discuss his
accomplishments?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're probably thinking about Josh Gibson, dubbed by some
``the black Babe Ruth.'' According to the book A Who's Who of
Sports Champions, the Negro Leagues didn't keep accurate records,
but it goes on to say Gibson was credited with ``as many as 84 home
runs in a season, which might include as many as 200 games, and he
is believed to have hit nearly 800 home runs in his 17 seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   The Baseball Encyclopedia lists Gibson as having hit a total of
146 home runs in 17 years; the most it lists for him in a single
year is 17, in 1939. A spokesman at the National Baseball Hall of
Fame explained the discrepancy by saying the Baseball Encyclopedia
prints statistics only for the games it could find statistics for,
and might include very few games out of the larger number of games
that actually took place in any one season.
</P>
<P>
   Several Internet sites dealing with Gibson also vary in the
details. One says he hit ``about 800 home runs in the 17 years he
played, including 75 in the 1931 season.'' Another, Sports
Illustrated's SIonline, credits Gibson with 962 home runs in his
17-year career.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson was born in Buena Vista, Ga., in 1911 and died in 1947,
the year Jackie Robinson became the first black player in the major
leagues. Gibson, who played with the Pittsburgh Homestead Grays and
the Pittsburgh Crawfords, was inducted into the National Baseball
Hall of Fame in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Q: With all the publicity about the Titanic, I'm reminded of the
Lusitania, which was sunk by a German U-boat, drawing the United
States into World War I. Was it ever determined that the Lusitania
was hauling munitions, as the Germans claimed?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. The Lusitania, sunk by a German submarine May 7, 1915,
was carrying a cargo of about 173 tons of rifle ammunition and
shells. The Germans, who had circulated warnings that the ship
would be subject to being torpedoed, felt fully justified in
attacking a vessel that was furthering the war aims of their enemy.
The German government also felt that, in view of the vulnerability
of U-boats while on the surface and the British announcement of
intentions to arm merchant ships, prior warning of targets was
impractical.
</P>
<P>
   The British Admiralty had warned the Lusitania to avoid the area
off the south coast of Ireland amid reports of submarine activity
and the sinking of merchant ships. The ship's crew chose to ignore
those recommendations. Within 20 minutes of being struck, the
Lusitania sank and 1,198 people _ including 128 U.S. citizens _
lost their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The United States sent a note to Berlin on May 13, 1915,
expressing an indictment of the principles on which the submarine
war was being fought, but it and two other notes were the only
immediate reaction to the Lusitania sinking. Only in 1917 did the
United States cite German submarine warfare as a justification for
American entry into the war.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that President Clinton was nominated for the
Nobel Peace Prize, yet I've seen nothing in the media about it. Is
it true?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. It was widely reported in late January when Clinton was
nominated by members of the Party of Progress, one of the largest
blocs in Norway's Parliament. The Norwegian lawmakers nominated him
for his efforts to protect world peace and promote democracy.
``Throughout his presidency, he has been a guarantor and friend of
peace,'' the lawmakers said in a statement. They praised Clinton
for helping end the war in Bosnia and for standing up to ``despots
who want to repress human rights and democracy's rules of fair
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Norway's national legislatures are among those with
Nobel nomination rights, and they often announce the name of their
candidates. The Oslo-based Nobel awards committee normally refuses
to release the names of nominees, usually in the range of 120-130
each year, or comment on candidates. The winner is announced in
Oslo, usually in mid-October, and the award is presented Dec. 10,
the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, the Swede who endowed
the prizes.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Norwegian legislators, Vidar Kleppe, said the
decision to nominate Clinton was made last December, before
knowledge of Clinton's ``inappropriate relationship'' with Monica
Lewinsky became widespread.

   BRITISH-COLUMBIA _ During late July and early August, Sally and
I spent three nights in Vancouver, and two nights in Victoria, on

 &HT;    Look before you leap into getting new computer running
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only way I really learn is by screwing up. I ought to be a
genius by now.
</P>
<P>
   My latest lesson came when I bought my new computer two weeks
ago. I got it from one of those bargain basement outfits _ a
hole-in-the-wall office in a small shopping center. It had the best
price I could find _ $800 lower than what I would have paid for a
computer configured the same way from the brand-name companies.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you think this is going to be a tale of woe of how the
small company cheated me, sold me a beige-colored box full of
low-rent components. That's not true. The major components of the
computer were top quality and _ after about a week's worth of
tweaking on my part _ the PC works great.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a tale of woe. It's about what I learned by screwing
up.
</P>
<P>
   I learned that getting a new computer up and running correctly
can be an intimidating task for ordinary mortals. And I'm as
ordinary and as mortal as they come. Maybe some of my adventures
with the new PC will be of some help to you.
</P>
<P>
   My main mistake was in failing to plan. I got so excited by the
notion of a new computer that I didn't stop to think. For instance,
I knew I would need to transfer some files from my old computer.
But I didn't see that as any big deal. I don't own a Zip drive but
_ since I didn't need to move programs, just some documents from
Microsoft Word, stored e-mail, a few spreadsheet files and stuff _
I figured floppy disks would work fine.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson 1. I had a lot more data than I would have dreamed
possible. Some of it included electronic photo files from my
digital camera and image scanner. I should have used a Zip drive or
some other storage device bigger than a floppy disk. You've heard
of tennis elbow? I finished the week with floppy disk wrist from
all that disk swapping.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson 2. I wish I had stored my personal data in separate
easy-to-find folders. It was scattered all over the computer. Some
of that is unavoidable, but most of it could have been stored in
separate folders. Since my old computer got handed down to a
friend, I wanted to make sure all my personal files were gone. None
of the stuff is particularly interesting or sensitive (other than
some poetry so bad it's probably against the law in Georgia), but I
didn't want someone else reading it. So I spent hours tracking down
personal files in almost every folder on the PC.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson 3. I should have stored the installation CDs for the
programs I really need (Microsoft Office, Eudora Pro and other
staples of computing life) all in one place. You're probably not as
absent-minded as I am. And because of my job I end up with a lot of
software that I don't need. But I spent more time searching for
installation CDs than I did getting the computer set up.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson 4. I learned that things aren't always as easy as they
seem. Lots of times I'll get e-mail from a reader with a computer
problem and I'll think _ jeez, that's easy to fix. Last week
furnished a fresh taste of how complicated supposedly simple things
can be.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few low-rent components on my new computer was a
no-name modem card. I couldn't get the danged thing to work
correctly. I actually know a lot about modems. But I finally had to
call for help from my Internet provider's technical support staff.
After two hours, those folks couldn't solve the problem. Luckily I
had a spare external modem and did what any wise person would do _
gave up and installed the external.
</P>
<P>
   One of the certainties in life is the fact you'll replace that
computer of yours someday. Unless you want to become a genius like
I am, start planning now.

</P>
<P>
   Description: Soft, medium to heavy, nutty, spicy, sherry
accented. After dinner.
</P>

<P>
   Description: Big, malty, oaky, sherryish. After dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: Experienced tasters place Glenfarclas malts in the top
three or four from Speyside. The word means ``valley of the green
grass.'' Founded in 1836, it is family-owned and regarded as the
most independent of all Scottish distilleries. Mostly aged in
sherry casks. Its Cask Strength 105 label is the strongest single
malt offered by any distillery in an official bottling.

distillery pioneered the export of single malt scotch in 1963, when
it was considered too intense for people outside of Scotland.
Founded in 1886-87 on the glen of the River Fiddich and is still
owned by original family. In 1991, nine casks of 50-year-old
Glenfiddich were bottled and sold for $5,000, but one fetched
$70,000 at an auction in Milan.

<P>
   Origin: Eastern Lowlands

</P>
<P>
   Age: 12 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Description: Flowery, fruit, peachy. Aperitif.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The only whisky allowed to use the name of the glen of
the River Livet and the definite article ``The'' on its label, even
though other malts use Glenlivet as a place identifier for their
brands. This is perhaps the most famous Speyside malt and is the
biggest-selling single malt in the U.S. market. The brand dates
back to 1824, but was started at its current site in 1858. About a
third of the scotch is matured in sherry casks.

   Age: 10 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Description: Delicately spicy. In younger ages, an aperitif; in
older ages, after dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Comments: The biggest-selling malt in Scotland but from a small
company. (The Scots pronounce it to rhyme with ``organgey.'' Owned
by the same company since 1918. Uses bourbon casks and has faint
hint of seaweed in taste because of the coastal location of the
distillery.

   Age: 10-15 years
</P>
<P>
   Description: Elegant with suggestions of berry fruits with a
perfumey nose suggesting raspberries in cream.

   GLENLIVET, Scotland _ No one knows when distilling began in
Scotland. Ancient Celts using rudimentary stills made a fiery
liquid they called ``uisge beatha;'' the root of the word
``whiskey,'' it means ``water of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the centuries, stills flourished in out of the way places,
and many modern distillers date back to these. Wandering from
distillery to distillery, blenders would gather malt and grain
whiskies and mixed them to create what became the familiar brands
such as Cutty Sark, Dewar's and Johnnie Walker. Single malts were
an indulgence of the Scots nearly exclusively until after World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   Malt scotches are products of single distilleries using only
water and malted barley, most of which is grown on Scottish fields.
Blended scotches, which still account for 90 percent of the scotch
whisky market, are made by combining as many as 50 malt and grain
whiskies.
</P>
<P>
   The process of making single malt scotch is seemingly simple.
</P>
<P>
   Barley is soaked in water and kept until it germinates and
sprouts, increasing the sugar content. When the sprout reaches
about the size of the nail of the small finger, the barley is
placed in a kiln and dried over fires fueled in part by peat --
turf cut from the hills and fields. The Scots call this process
``malting.'' Smoking the barley in the peat, which varies in
content of grasses, heather and flowers, subtly influences the
flavor the toasted barley will impart.
</P>
<P>
   The malted barley then is milled and mixed with warm water, and
the liquid called ``wort'' is drained off. Yeast is added to the
heated wort in huge tanks, creating a violent reaction that causes
the liquid to appear to be boiling, giving off pungent a carbon
dioxide-rich gas that smells much like very strong beer and will
burn the nose.
</P>
<P>
   The fermented liquid is then boiled in large, pot-bellied copper
vats with distinctive gooseneck designs. The alcohol vaporizes and
condenses, is captured and stored in casks, most often those
re-used from aging bourbon or sherry and occasionally port wine or
armagnac. As much of 70 percent of the flavor comes from the wood
in which the scotches are aged. They are aged a minimum of three
years to qualify as scotch, and many are aged 10 to 15 years and
more.
</P>
<P>
   It's remarkably labor ``un-intenstive.'' Tormore distillery
employs 11 men, while the giant Glemorangie has a staff of 16 men
and one woman. The entire scotch whisky industry only employs
12,500 people.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the high-tech age, malt scotch is made pretty much the
same way its has been made for 300 years. In some distilleries, the
job of monitoring the stills has been given over to computers, a
change traditionalists abhor because they insist the only suitable
quality control instrument for whisky making is a human being.
</P>
<P>
   After decades in the trade, distillers observing the spirit
coming from the stills make their adjustments by checking
temperature and faint changes in the smell and color.

   GLENLIVET, Scotland _ Standing on the grassy bank, Robbie Hughes
casts a stainless steel canister into the still, clear water.
</P>
<P>
   Dapples of sunlight break through the 100-foot trees around the
pool, which holds water from four springs that come up through the
rocks up the side of the steep hill. From time to time, a trout
will break the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Tugging on a white cord, Hughes reels in the full canister and
places it on top of a cabinet built of stone and lumber. He opens
the cabinet and finds three small glasses and sets them out on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the finest bar in the whole world,'' Hughes, 32, tells
a pair of visitors who offer no arguments. He pours the cold,
crystalline water into the glasses. ``Taste that,'' he says,
reaching again into a cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   He uncorks a bottle of 10-year-old Tormore single malt scotch
and pours two fingers worth of the pale, golden whisky in each
glass. ``Now,'' he says, ``taste this.''
</P>
<P>
   When sampled this way, one right after the other, the connection
between the water of this unique burn and the drink it yields is
unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
   However, this is perhaps the only place on Earth where Tormore
is still served. The brand has fallen victim to the realities of
doing business in the booming single malt trade.
</P>
<P>
   The distillery's owner, Allied Distillers Ltd., whose parent
firm also owns Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins, has dropped
Tormore as an independent brand and intends instead to use it in
its blended whiskies, merging its distinctive flavors with others.
</P>
<P>
   A surge in single malt price, demand
</P>
<P>
   A novelty in the United States just a few years ago, single malt
scotch well may be the drink of the '90s. While sales of spirits --
including blended scotches -- have been generally flat in recent
years, single malts have surged.
</P>
<P>
   In the years between 1992 and 1997, U.S. sales more than doubled
from 4.3 million bottles to 8.7 million bottles, according to the
Edinburgh, Scotland-based Scotch Whisky Association. Last year
alone, U.S. sales jumped 14 percent making single malt scotch the
fstest growing category of liquor. Americans consumed nearly 20
percent of the single malt scotch sold worldwide
</P>
<P>
   Its prices range from $30 to $100 in stores, making it well in
to the high end of liquors. Prices can reach dizzying heights.
Christie's Scotland auction house holds regular sales, with vintage
malts going for $1,000 to $10,000 a bottle. The magazine Malt
Advocate reported that a Japanese tourist recently paid about
$16,000 for a bottle of 60-year-old Macallan from a specialty shop
at London's Heathrow Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, two men were arrested on charges of trying to
scam investors eager to get into the hot market. Using a
Gibraltar-based company, Hamilton Spirit Management, the men sold
shares in little-known single malt brands at $1,600 to $5,000 with
promises of returns of 18 percent a year when the brands took off.
The scotches were of little value, yet the men still managed to
take in more than $11 million from investors.
</P>
<P>
   Evan Campbell, a spokesman for the Scotch Whisky Association,
believes the increased demand in scotch whisky is partly cultural
-- people are looking for new experiences -- and partly smart
marketing of a fine product.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a bit of a backlash to the '80s,'' Campbell said.
``People have decided in the '90s that it's OK to consume spirits
in moderation, and they're looking for a good quality drink. At the
same time, malt is becoming more available to them.''
</P>
<P>
   To promote their brands, single malt makers are employing the
techniques of California vineyards. They want people to sample the
products firsthand and learn enough to know what it is they are
tasting. Single malt aficionados seem to travel in the same social
tribes that seek out expensive cigars, wines and cognacs.
</P>
<P>
   Bars and restaurants offer scotch tastings and lectures on the
complexities and variations of single malts, which vary
dramatically in flavors from a powerful iodine sting to a honey
richness. Cultivated wine drinkers tend to appreciate the nuances
and individuality of single malts, finding a certain fascination in
regional influences on both.
</P>
<P>
   Appropriate for the drink of the '90s, the scotch industry has
had a wave of mergers and acquisitions, involving huge players such
as Seagram, United Distillers and Allied Distillers.
</P>
<P>
   More than 150 brands are now produced, but the number is being
reduced as corporate managers seek efficiencies in their marketing
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is a natural product of market forces, Campbell said.
``In some cases, they are deciding to put their marketing efforts
behind a single, or fewer brands rather than across the board,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, fine brands such as Tormore and Dallas Dhu now exist
only in storage and on a few shelves, making scotch drinkers fret
about the future.
</P>
<P>
   One whisky store in Dufftown, the heart of the Speyside whisky
country, offers more than 100 brands, but the store owner lamented
the other day that 26 were no longer in production.
</P>
<P>
   Searching the shelves for lost brands, Robert Burns -- an
Aberdeen salesman and whisky lover, not the poet -- expressed a
common worry: ``I just hope that I don't live to see the day when
they take the individuality out of what is the world's most
individualistic drink.''
</P>
<P>
   A product of its environment: It's the water, stupid!
</P>
<P>
   While some spirits can be made virtually anywhere -- vodka and
gin for example -- single malts are products of their environments.
Each represents a place.
</P>
<P>
   And what places. There are four major Scotch producing regions:
The Lowlands, The Highlands, Campbelltown and the Isle of Islay.
</P>
<P>
   The highest concentration of distilleries is in the Highland
district known as Speyside, so named because the River Spey snakes
through it. The water in Speyside has attracted scores of
distillers over the past 200 years. It falls on the hills and
filters through the rocks and soil, giving it a peaty taste that
remains with the scotch. Speyside whiskies have come to be known as
the ``premier grand cru'' of single malts, and there is growing
demand for those aged more than 25 to 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   It is an area of rare, sometimes eerie natural beauty, with
broad emerald glens surrounded by hills that in late summer are
sided by patchworks of deep violet heather. Looking from narrow
roads like tiny cotton puffs, sheep graze on the hillsides. Here
and there are stone farmhouses and barns, occasionally the ruins of
an ancient church or castle. Everywhere there is water, from rivers
with names such as the Livet and the Fiddich.
</P>
<P>
   It is a place to be explored -- languidly -- by car. Many
distilleries offer tours or at least tolerate visitors.
Glennfiddich has an elaborate gift shop and tourist complex at its
honey-and-gray stone distillery house with the pagoda-shaped roof
that is common among distilleries. Glennfiddich, one of the few
family owned brands, is a pioneer in the business; in 1963, the
company was the first to export its single malt. The conventional
wisdom at the time was that it was too powerful for tastebuds owned
by anyone but a Scot.
</P>
<P>
   The attempt at whisky-related tourism here is thankfully minimal
but there are many other reasons to visit, not the least of which
is its charm and serenity.
</P>
<P>
   This is what lured Brett and Christine Holmes to buy the Minmore
house, an elegant country estate bed and breakfast that is said to
have been the residence of the founder of the Glenlivet distillery
next door.
</P>
<P>
   Minmore House gets some traffic in guests on the Scotch Whisky
Trail, a route marked along the winding roads that work between
glen and burn, but most of the business comes from hunters and
fishermen, for whom this must be some kind of heaven. A log in the
hotel's lobby lists accounts by guests of landing large trout and
15-pound salmon in the River Avon.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit, its guests were obviously well-to-do older
couples from England and Edinburgh and Aberdeen. Holmes offers his
guests a handsome array of Speyside scotches in his bar, with its
large front window overlooking an expanse of meadows.
</P>
<P>
   The guests joked in the bar that one of their aims is to sample
each scotch at least once -- with the goal of testing them all
before consolidation in the industry leaves the world with only one
single malt scotch.
</P>
<P>
   Single malt's disappearing act
</P>
<P>
   Robbie Hughes lives in a house that sits in a row that once was
a sort of commune for the distillery workers. He is the only
Tormore employee who lives there, with his other 10 co-workers
commuting in from surrounding villages.
</P>
<P>
   The distillery remains one of the most elegant in Speyside, with
pristine white buildings, decorative dormer windows, a belfry and
musical clock with a curving lake in the front surrounded by
sculpted topiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Built during a scotch boom in 1958, it was the first completely
new malt distillery to be built in the highlands this century.
``They built it here by this wee burn, the Achvochkie,'' Hughes
says as he leads some visitors up the hill to the natural spring
pool.
</P>
<P>
   While Tormore no longer exists as an independent brand, Allied,
which also produces Ballantine, Scapa and Laphroig, has given no
indication that it will close the distillery.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Hughes worries that this and other unique shades of malt
are disappearing all too quickly just as the market, particularly
the American market, is finding the joy of variety.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't think it was 'in your face' enough, so they
decided not to keep it around,'' Hughes says, taking a last
mournful sip by the pool. ``It's a crying shame, isn't it?''

many as 50 malt and grain whiskies.
</P>
<P>
   The process of making single malt scotch is seemingly simple.
</P>
<P>
   Barley is soaked in water and kept until it germinates and
sprouts, increasing the sugar content. When the sprout reaches
about the size of the nail of the small finger, the barley is
placed in a kiln and dried over fires fueled in part by peat --
turf cut from the hills and fields. The Scots call this process
``malting.'' Smoking the barley in the peat, which varies in
content of grasses, heather and flowers, subtly influences the
flavor the toasted barley will impart.
</P>
<P>
   The malted barley then is milled and mixed with warm water, and
the liquid called ``wort'' is drained off. Yeast is added to the
heated wort in huge tanks, creating a violent reaction that causes
the liquid to appear to be boiling, giving off ch as Seagram,
United Distillers and Allied Distillers.
</P>
<P>
   More than 150 brands are now produced, but the number is being
reduced as corporate managers seek efficiencies in their marketing
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is a natural product of market forces, Campbell said.
``In some cases, they are deciding to put their marketing efforts
behind a single, or fewer brands rather than across the board,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, fine brands such as Tormore and Dallas Dhu now exist
only in storage and on a few shelves, making scotch drinkers fret
about the future.
</P>
<P>
   One whisky store in Dufftown, the heart of the Speyside whisky
country, offers more than 100 brands, but the store owner lamented
the other day that 26 were no longer in production.
</P>
<P>
   Searching the shelves for lost brands, Robert Burns -- an
Aberdeen salesman and whisky lover, not the poet -- expressed a
common worry: ``I just hope that I don't live to see the day when
they take the individuality out of what is the world's most
individualistic drink.''
</P>
<P>
   A product of its environment: It's the water, stupid!
</P>
<P>
   While some spirits can be made virtually anywhere -- vodka and
gin for example -- single malts are products of their environments.
Each represents a place.
</P>
<P>
   And what places. There are four major Scotch producing regions:
The Lowlands, The Highlands, Campbelltown and the Isle of Islay.
</P>
<P>
   The highest concentration of distilleries is in the Highland
district known as Speyside, so named because the River Spey snakes
through it. The water in Speyside has attracted scores of
distillers over the past 200 years. It falls on the hills and
filters through the rocks and soil, giving it a peaty taste that
remains with the scotch. Speyside whiskies have come to be known as
the ``premier grand cru'' of single malts, and there is growing
demand for those aged more than 25 to 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   It is an area of rare, sometimes eerie natural beauty, with
broad emerald glens surrounded by hills that in late summer are
sided by patchworks of deep vi

A GUIDE TO THE QUICKIE STARR PAPERBACKS  
</HEADLINE>
  By TIMOTHY NOAH

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Flytrap aficionados will need to purchase one of the three
paperback versions of the Starr report, which hit the stores
Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   They are Pocket Books ($5.99), Prima ($9.99) and the Washington
Post's Public Affairs edition ($10).
</P>
<P>
   Here's how they match up:
</P>
<P>
   Format: The Washington Post edition) is a trade paperback, with
bigger-sized pages and a more pliant spine. Unlike the other two
editions, it can be stretched out and laid on a table while you
munch a sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   Introductory material: In the Pocket Books version, Phil Kuntz
of the Wall Street Journal writes a five-page intro that is an
economical-but-thorough explanation of how a 1992 New York Times
story about Whitewater by Jeff Gerth led to a 1998 report about
Monica Lewinsky by Ken Starr. This is precisely what readers will
need to be reminded about, especially in a few years, when the
details become hazy in everybody's mind.
</P>
<P>
   Fairness: The Pocket Books and Post versions both reprint the
preliminary rebuttal from Clinton's lawyer. The Prima version does
not. None of the three paperback versions contains the rebuttal
Clinton's lawyers produced after they actually had a chance to read
the report.
</P>
<P>
   Did Journalists Get Rich Off This?: The Pocket Books version
earned Kuntz an undisclosed sum, but he won't be getting royalties.
The Post reporters whose articles are being reprinted in the Post
edition won't get paid at all, because they don't own their
stories. The Prima version contains no material from journalists at
all.
</P>
<P>
   Overall Winner: The Post version, entirely on the grounds that
it's a trade paperback. But the Pocket Books version is the more
practical choice for those who don't need to worry about eyestrain.
The Prima version places a distant third.

CONTRACT BRIDGE CRUMBLES  
 SIDES AGREE ON LITTLE EXCEPT TKACHUK IS UNDERPAID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Believe it or not, Bobby Smith and Bob Murray agree upon a
couple of things regarding Coyotes captain Keith Tkachuk.
</P>
<P>
   They believe he's one of the NHL's top 10 players.
</P>
<P>
   They also believe he's vastly underpaid at $2.8 million this
season. But that's about where the mutual understanding ends
between Smith, Coyotes general manager, and Murray, agent for the
holdout Tkachuk.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he were a Group II free agent, we would be willing to pay
him more than $2.8 million this year. There's no question about
that,'' Smith said. ``But the issue is not how good Keith is
compared to (Jaromir) Jagr or Doug Weight or (Teemu) Selanne or
anybody. The issue is, this guy's got two years left on his
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ````The Hockey News'' ranks him the 10th-best player in the
league. Where is he? Is he third? Is he seventh? Is he 14th? I
don't know. That is not the issue. Keith Tkachuk's a great player.
. . . Surprisingly, the disagreement has not been slotting Keith
into the league's hierarchy. The issue has been, he's still got two
years left on his contract.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time he signed his five-year deal, an offer sheet from
the Chicago Blackhawks that the Winnipeg Jets matched, Tkachuk was
of of the five highest-paid players in the league. The first year
alone, he earned $6 million. The remaining four years were for
substantially lower pay _ $2.6 million, $2.8 million, $2.8 million
this season and $3 million in 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
   It guaranteed him financial security, but by locking himself in
for such a long period, he has been unable to reap the benefits of
a skyrocketing NHL marketplace, which now has seen 11 players make
$6 million or more on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 players are being paid more than Tkachuk this
season. All of them, according to figures obtained by agents, will
make at least $4 million. That's at least $1.2 million a year more
than the Coyotes' best player.
</P>
<P>
   Five players are making $8 million or more _ Detroit's Sergei
Fedorov ($14.5 million), Philadelphia's Eric Lindros and Anaheim's
Paul Kariya ($8.5 million each) and Vancouver's Pavel Bure and
Buffalo's Dominik Hasek ($8 million each). Several others have
deals that will pay them that much and more within the next one to
three years, including Anaheim's Selanne, a former Jets forward,
whose contract escalates to $8.9 million and $9.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Modano of Dallas and the Penguins' Jagr recently signed
deals that will put them well above the $8 million mark. Tkachuk,
the third-highest goal scorer in the league the past five seasons,
wants _ and expects _ to be placed in that company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make any sense to get locked in again to another
long-term deal when everyone knows salaries are going to keep going
up,'' one NHL agent said. ``Just look at Jeremy Roenick and Teemu
Selanne. Heck, those guys are in Tkachuk's own back yard. He should
know better than anybody that those two guys had to bite the bullet
the last couple years of their deals when everybody else was
starting to make a ton of more money.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray concedes that the NHL salary bar almost certainly will
rise to substantial heights during each of the next five seasons
when Tkachuk, if he gets an extension, would be locked up by the
Coyotes. In fact, he cites a study he claims both the players
association and the NHL stand by that shows the average NHL salary
has risen an average of 23.4 percent every year for the past seven
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just not a two-year thing caused by a couple big
contracts like the (Joe) Sakic or Fedorov deals, where the numbers
get skewed,'' Murray said. ``This is a seven-year average. Even if
it only goes up half of that, that's still an 11 percent to 12
percent increase, and that's 55 percent in five years.''
</P>
<P>
   So why, then, doesn't Tkachuk simply honor the final two years
of his deal and rub his palms in anticipation of striking a
mega-rich offer sheet when he becomes a Group II free agent? Who's
to say that a team such as the New York Rangers or the Blackhawks
or even an expansion team such as Atlanta wouldn't pony up with a
$50 million offer?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tempting, but there are a few reasons why Keith is
willing to commit to a five-year deal with Phoenix,'' Murray said.
``For one, there's financial security to it. Two, he really likes
playing there, and he wants to stay there for a long time. And
three, the Coyotes know they won't be able to match an offer sheet
that big, so they'd end up trading him before his second year is
up, anyway. He doesn't want that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, all negotiations are off, Smith said. Tkachuk,
meanwhile, won't even make his full $2.8 million when or if he
reports. After four days of his holdout, he already has lost
$40,724 due to suspension. &QL;

BAD BACK LIKELY TO KEEP CLEMENT OUT FOR 2 GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Anthony Clement started and finished every game
during three years in the trenches in college, remarkable for a man
who is 6 feet 7 and 355 pounds _ plenty of target for an injury.
</P>
<P>
   Clement now plays for the Cardinals, for whom some twists of
fate are difficult to explain. The heretofore stranger to the
training room has been beset by injuries since camp. On Tuesday,
the team announced that his sore back is more serious than first
believed.
</P>
<P>
   He will not suit up for the home opener Sunday against
Philadelphia and probably won't make the trip next week to St.
Louis. Clement, the largest player ever drafted by the Cardinals,
was pushing starting right tackle James Dexter.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals medical personnel said Clement underwent a CAT-scan
Tuesday morning and received an epidural injection to reduce pain
in his lower back. Further diagnostics are expected today. Neither
Coach Vince Tobin nor the medical staff was more specific about the
nature of the injury, refusing to say whether it is muscular or
skeletal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get into any of that,'' Tobin said. ``He has a
sore back, and we're hoping to relieve the pain by medication.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Tobin wanted to make changes in his struggling offensive
line _ and he indicated Tuesday that he really doesn't _ his
options now are limited as the Cardinals try to shake two
season-opening routs. Clement, a second-round draft pick from
Southwestern Louisiana, was the strongest candidate to unseat a
starter.
</P>
<P>
   Center Aaron Graham did not dress for the 33-14 loss Sunday in
Seattle after suffering a calf strain in practice Friday. He
remains questionable. Mike Devlin would start in Graham's absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're down to eight offensive linemen, but that's the number
you normally dress anyway,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that two of the remaining eight, backups Jerome
Daniels (knee) and Allen DeGraffenreid (ankle), are coming off
injuries that caused them to miss considerable practice time.
Daniels has been inactive both games. DeGraffenreid saw spot duty
in Seattle after being inactive for the opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their development has been set back,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   The only healthy backup is Matt Joyce, who becomes the third
tackle. He also has experience at guard. DeGraffenreid played
tackle in college, worked at guard with the Cardinals last season
and is listed as the third center.
</P>
<P>
   ``DeGraffenreid can play anywhere along the line,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said the club is not likely to go shopping for a lineman
this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``First we have to find out when Clement is going to be back,''
Tobin said. ``And Graham's injury isn't long term. You can't just
go out and sign a guy anytime you get an injury because then you
have to release somebody else. That's why you have 53 on a roster
and dress only 45. If there's no overabundance of injuries at one
spot, you try to take care of it with the people you've kept.''
</P>
<P>
   Clement complained of back pain during training camp, Tobin
said. Then Clement suffered a strained knee during preseason that
sidelined him for two weeks. His first day back at practice,
Clement aggravated the back injury. He blamed it on a bulky knee
brace, saying he couldn't move comfortably. He believes he torqued
his back trying to compensate for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had gradually gotten better,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   After sitting out the season opener, Clement played briefly
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' Clement said. ``I was never hurt in
college, never. I'm not going to make a push for a starting job
sitting in the training room.''
</P>
<P>
   Clement had no history of back problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing in medical evaluations from the scouting
combine in Indianapolis to indicate any problems,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   The line is foremost among many problems for the Cardinals, who
have scored 10 and 14 points with an offense ranked 28th in the NFL
this week. &QL;

PSST, BUDDY: WANNA BUY A BASEBALL? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three people claim to own the baseball Sammy Sosa hit for his
62nd home run.
</P>
<P>
   In other news, a Glendale man says he will sell the Hitler diary
he found in his attic.
</P>
<P>
   A 97-year-old Florida woman claims she engaged in an improper
relationship with President Warren G. Harding in the Oval Office,
and has in her possession a pair of bloomers that will prove it.
</P>
<P>
   How about you?
</P>
<P>
   Buying or selling?
</P>
<P>
   What's the going price for fame?
</P>
<P>
   I'll take $500,000 for Sosa's No. 62. I obtained the ball from
an associate who stole it from a collector who reportedly acquired
it from Chicago man known only as ``Vinnie.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's home run race has brought out the best in us, and the
worst.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Mark McGwire hit No. 62. A stadium employee, faithful
as a Labrador, retrieved the piece of history and presented the
ball to the St. Louis slugger. McGwire gave it to the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's 62nd homer is . . .
</P>
<P>
   Where?
</P>
<P>
   It belongs to . . .
</P>
<P>
   Whom?
</P>
<P>
   Is it real, or a fake?
</P>
<P>
   It's baseball's Maltese Falcon.
</P>
<P>
   According to newspaper accounts, Gary ``Moe'' Mullins said he
caught Sosa's home run ball Sunday when it sailed over the Wrigley
Field bleachers and onto Waveland Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Greedy fans jumped him.
</P>
<P>
   Kicked him.
</P>
<P>
   Someone bit his hand.
</P>
<P>
   The ball was ripped away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strong-armed robbery,'' Mullins said.
</P>
<P>
   A teenager later claimed to be the rightful owner. Another man
who wound up with the prize insists ``he'' is.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is now a national story, and attorneys and law
professors are weighing in.
</P>
<P>
   Most legal minds agree that ownership (the state or fact of
being the owner) goes to the first person to possess (to hold or
occupy) abandoned property, i.e., the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rule is the ball is abandoned property when it is hit off
the field, and new title over it is established when seized by the
first taker,'' said Chicago law Professor Richard Epstein.
</P>
<P>
   The first taker being Mr. Mullins, who is so peeved he's
threatening a civil lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The other claimants reportedly have put in calls to Alan
Dershowitz.
</P>
<P>
   Also at issue is authenticity. No one knows whether this ball is
THE ball. And Major League Baseball is to blame.
</P>
<P>
   When McGwire was closing in on No. 62, each baseball put into
play was secretly marked. After Big Mac broke Roger Maris' record,
the identification system was abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, it's impossible to determine whether the ball that
three people claim to be theirs is the real McCoy, as baseballs
look alike.
</P>
<P>
   How would you file a report?
</P>
<P>
   Police: ``What's it look like?''
</P>
<P>
   Fan: ``What do you ``think'' it looks like? It's a ``baseball.''
Round. White. Lot of red stitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Police: ``Any other physical characteristics? Scars? Unusual
markings? How much does it weigh?''
</P>
<P>
   Fan: ``I dunno.''
</P>
<P>
   Police: ``Approximately.''
</P>
<P>
   Fan: ``Five, six ounces maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be difficult to pick Sosa's unmarked home run ball out
of a lineup.
</P>
<P>
   This much is certain. As the season draws to an end, and McGwire
and Sosa conclude the most exciting dinger derby in history _
McGwire hit No. 63 on Tuesday _ the scramble for souvenirs is
becoming frightening.
</P>
<P>
   Did you see the scene on TV when Sosa hit No. 62? It looked like
someone tossed a raw T-bone into a kennel.
</P>
<P>
   When a fan emerged from the dog pile, he tucked the ball under
his shirt and took off. ``There he is. Get him!'' Hundreds gave
chase. It looked like the running of the bulls in Pamplona.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who values his or her well-being more than the potential
dollar value of the ball would treat it like a live grenade, and
get rid of it quickly.
</P>
<P>
   We need to get this season over before someone gets hurt. &QL;

LEAPHART'S INJURY UNDERCUTS PROGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Few players worked as hard during the off-season
as
 &UR; Randy Leaphart. &UR; Instead of sulking over being replaced as the
starting center last year, Leaphart made a commitment to getting
better and started the first two games at left guard.
</P>
<P>
   But now his football future is uncertain after suffering a knee
injury early in Saturday's 26-6 loss to Brigham Young. Leaphart is
a fifth-year senior who used his redshirt year.
</P>
<P>
   An MRI on Leaphart's right knee revealed significant ligament
damage. It's being called a sprain for now, and he is definitely
out of the North Texas game Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Every coach hates when a player gets hurt. But for ASU's  &UR; Bruce
 &UR; Snyder, &UR; this is more distressing because of what Leaphart
accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best 12 months he's had as a football player,''
Snyder said. ``Starting. Playing better. Enjoying being part of the
team. It's the first time he's really been in that position.
Sometimes life doesn't seem fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaphart, who showed up at Tuesday's practice sporting a large
brace, was taking it in stride _ a wobbly stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' he said, ``It happens in football.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-3, 280-pound Leaphart started the first four games
last year before  &UR; Marvel Smith filled in for one game and  &UR; Grey
Ruegamer moved from left tackle the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Coach during spring ball and asked if I could switch
from center to guard,'' Leaphart said. ``He said, `We'll see what
you got.' I worked hard. I watched films and looked at people
before me. I worked hard over the summer. Weight room. I did what I
had to do, and I guess it paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaphart hasn't ruled out playing again this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's definite, that's for sure,'' he said. ``Hopefully,
I'll be back on the field sooner than later.''
</P>
<P>
   Redshirt freshman  &UR; Scott Peters will start in Leaphart's place.
Peters is talented, but ASU now has little depth up front.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're bare bones,'' Snyder said. &QL; 
Return engagement &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Darrell Dickey, &UR; North Texas's first-year head coach, has
visited Sun Devil Stadium before. In 1995, he was Texas El-Paso's
offensive coordinator when ASU won, 45-20. And in 1982, he was a
senior quarterback for Kansas State in a game against the Sun
Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Unleashing a furious blitz on Dickey, ASU won, 30-7. Dickey and
his backups were sacked six times. Before leaving the game with an
elbow injury in the third quarter, Dickey completed 7 of 12 passes
for just 60 yards and an interception returned by defensive end
 &UR; Bryan Caldwell 20 yards for a touchdown after the ball bounced off
linebacker  &UR; Jimmy
 &UR; Williams' shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Dickey, whose father,  &UR; Jim, &UR; was the Kansas State head coach,
earlier had fumbled to set up an ASU touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Jim Dickey said, ``They are as good a defensive
team as I ever want to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Coach  &UR; Darryl Rogers, &UR; ASU ended that season 10-2, beating
Oklahoma in the Fiesta Bowl. Dickey, a four-year starter, is the
only player in Kansas State history to lead the team in total
offense four straight years. &QL;

 UA'S McALLISTER IS HIS TOUGHEST CRITIC  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BY NORM FRAUENHEIM   
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _  &UR; Chris McAlister, film critic, has looked at his role
in Arizona's victory over Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   His review:
</P>
<P>
   Two thumbs down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at the film and I didn't recognize the player who was
supposed to be wearing my number,'' said McAlister, a preseason
All-American and an early leader among contenders for the Jim
Thorpe Award.
</P>
<P>
   The credits will show that McAlister had his first interception
and five tackles. He also broke up three pass attempts in Arizona's
31-14 victory at Stanford Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   For most players, those highlights would be enough to forget
about a couple of early mistakes:
</P>
<P>
   He was beaten once on a 67-yard pass. Then, he was charged with
pass interference.
</P>
<P>
   But McAlister remembers the errors.  &UR; Robert DeNiro doesn't blow
his lines, and All-American cornerbacks don't give up big plays.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Stanford didn't seem to respect McAlister. The
Cardinal threw at least 10 passes at his corner of the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't surprised by that at all because I didn't come and
play like Chris McAlister,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McAlister might be harder on himself than his teammates,
nevertheless, his critical self-appraisal represents a tone
expressed by the 2-0 Wildcats as they prepare for their home opener
Saturday night against Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I see in the game films is not really a solid performance
from our team,'' McAlister said. &QL; 
No bulletin board fodder &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 16th-ranked Wildcats are being very cautious about anything
they say in regard to Arizona State's 0-2 start after preseason
hype that had ASU in the national title hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just saw in one newspaper that they didn't know whether they
wanted to go to Pasadena (the Rose Bowl) or Tempe (the Fiesta),''
quarterback  &UR; Ortege Jenkins said. ``All I know is that you've got
to deal with what's right in front of you every week.
</P>
<P>
   ``In college football these days, there's not much difference
between Michigan and Miami of Ohio.'' &QL; 
Briefly ... &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Coach  &UR; Dick Tomey is not expected to announce
whether Jenkins or  &UR; Keith Smith will start at quarterback before
Saturday's kickoff. ``I know, but I'm not telling,'' said Jenkins,
who directed the Wildcats to 24 points against Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Tomey, 10-1 in home openers during 11 seasons at Arizona, is
searching for his first win over Iowa. He's 0-3 against the
Hawkeyes. He lost one while coaching at Hawaii. At Arizona, he's
0-2 vs. Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Injury report: Receiver  &UR; Brad Brennan is not expected to play
because of an ankle sprain suffered at Stanford.  &UR; Malosi
 &UR; Leonard, A.J. Brown and  &UR; Brandon Nash figure to get more playing
time. Also, safety  &UR; LeChaux Rich is questionable because of an
ankle sprain that sidelined him against Stanford. If he can't play,
the starting job will go to  &UR; Leland Gayles.

FCC RESPONDS TO ITS DIGITAL TV CRITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission lashed back Tuesday at critics in the telecommunications
industry who have blamed his agency for problems plaguing the
introduction of digital-television services, scheduled to begin in
just six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from the television programming and manufacturing
industries have faulted the commission for not setting clear rules
and standards for digital broadcasts and related equipment. In many
cases, the commission chose instead to let industry set the
standards itself. That has led to interindustry disagreements and
crippling incompatibilities in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the first high-definition sets now on sale cannot
receive HDTV programming from cable systems because the standards
for the cable that connects the set to the cable box have not been
completed _ an unresolved interindustry detail for which some set
makers blame the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   But in a speech to a group of broadcasters Tuesday, William
Kennard, the FCC chairman, called the criticisms self-serving
efforts to ``goad the government by playing the blame game.''
</P>
<P>
   Most businesses ask his agency for help, Kennard said, ``only if
they think government will give them a regulatory advantage.'' If
not, he added, ``They'll try to keep government out.''
</P>
<P>
   The government should get involved, Kennard added, only ``when
arguments are distorted by the prism of self-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Sony Corp. plans to announce Wednesday that unlike
other television manufacturers it will sell a high-definition
television set that is a conventional-style table-top model with a
picture tube, beginning in November. Every other manufacturer plans
to sell large rear-projection sets, some as big as a compact
automobile.
</P>
<P>
   More than 90 percent of the TV's sold today are conventional
models with a picture tube, known as ``direct view'' sets. That
leaves many industry analysts asking how the transition to digital
television can succeed, as long as manufacturers offer digital sets
in a style that is not popular with most buyers.
</P>
<P>
   James Palumbo, a Sony vice president, said his company chose
direct-view because such sets offered the highest picture quality,
and that he believed Sony would gain a competitive advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the market will initially have a bigger audience for
direct-view sets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other manufacturers are not producing direct-view sets now
because they are more complicated to manufacture and still cannot
display an HDTV image at its highest level of resolution. Sony
executives acknowledged that without saying what level of
resolution their HDTV would offer. ``It's misleading to do that,''
said James Bonan, another Sony vice president.
</P>
<P>
   But in one respect, Sony's strategy is similar to that of the
other companies. They are all entering the high-definition
television market with high-end products loaded with options and
added features _ and extraordinarily high price tags. With rare
exceptions, the first high-definition television sets will sell for
at least $8,000. Sony's 34-inch direct-view set will be priced at
$9,000.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard, in his speech to the International Television and Radio
Society in New York on Tuesday, said no one should be concerned
with the high initial prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you control for inflation,'' he said, ``the first color
sets in 1955 cost about $4,500.'' (Actually, RCA put the first
color television on the market in 1953, and it cost $1,000 _ just
over $6,000 in today's dollars.)
</P>
<P>
   Kennard added, ``The entire history of the introduction and
pricing of consumer-electronics equipment tells us that soon
enough, digital-television receivers will be increasingly
affordable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But let's not kid ourselves,'' he continued. ``The
digital-television rollout will be complicated.'' He urged
patience, ``for the transition to digital TV is inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Palumbo said Sony management held a similar view.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the beginning,'' he said, ``trial and error.''

STRATEGIES SET IN MICROSOFT ANTITRUST CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After nearly a year of testimony, acrimony and
debate, the opposing parties in the antitrust suit against
Microsoft Corp. appear to have settled on strategies for the trial
that begins in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   For Microsoft _ accused of bullying competitors, bribing allies
and forcing customers to use the company's products, like them or
not _ one general defense has come down to this: So what? Everyone
does it. That is how business operates.
</P>
<P>
   As John Warden, a Microsoft lawyer, put it: ``All companies
compete; that's how the market works.''
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for the Justice Department and 20 state attorneys
general who filed the landmark lawsuit against the software giant
four months ago predict that Microsoft's own leaders will prove the
government's case. In hundreds of e-mail messages and memorandums
written over the last several years, most of which will be entered
as evidence, these executives unabashedly laid out their plans and
intentions.
</P>
<P>
   What the documents show, said David Boies, a Justice Department
lawyer, is that Microsoft ``bribed people to take their products,
used predatory pricing and other anti-competitive tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   If every company behaves this way, as Microsoft asserts, ``then
we're going to be very busy'' in the coming years, one antitrust
official remarked.
</P>
<P>
   In a court hearing on Friday, Microsoft argued once again that
the government's case was baseless and asked Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson of the U.S. District Court to spare the nation the cost and
discomfort of a long trial by dismissing the case right away.
</P>
<P>
   The judge did not rule on that motion, though he indicated even
before it was filed that he was not inclined to grant it. He did
agree to Microsoft's request to delay the trial, which had been
scheduled to begin on Sept. 23, until Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft lawyers had complained that without more time they
could not respond to new evidence the government has gathered.
</P>
<P>
   As the two sides offered their competing strategies on Friday,
Jackson seemed equally willing to challenge both.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one part of the government's suit accuses Microsoft
of requiring Internet service providers to support Internet
Explorer, Microsoft's browser for navigating the World Wide Web, in
exchange for receiving promotional space on a part of the main
Windows screen known as the channel bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your browser is so good, why do you need all those
covenants anyway?'' Jackson asked.
</P>
<P>
   Warden, the Microsoft lawyer, responded that the arrangements
were simply ``promotional marketing agreements, very common tools
of competition, just like Pepsi makes a deal with Pizza Hut to
feature Pepsi exclusively.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge responded that such marketing arrangements did not
exist in the computer industry until Microsoft introduced them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Coca-Cola certainly does it,'' Warden said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, but Coke is not a monopoly,'' the judge answered. As he
had noted earlier, the rules governing how a monopolist can behave
are very different from those governing other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson seemed skeptical at times of the government's position,
too. Stephen Houck, an assistant attorney general from New York,
read from several internal memos and documents that the government
has introduced as evidence. One was a note that an employee sent to
Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, in March 1997 suggesting ways to
increase use of Internet Explorer and take customers away from
Netscape Communications Corp., the company's main competitor in the
Web browser market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a mistake not to bundle Internet Explorer with
Windows,'' Microsoft's operating system, the employee wrote. ``If
we take Internet Explorer away from the operating system, Netscape
users won't switch to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson then said rhetorically: ``These documents are not
necessarily inconsistent with the behavior of a competitor.'' To
that, Houck responded: ``No, it is inconsistent to use your
monopoly position in operating systems to gain market share and
disadvantage competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to reinforce that point, Houck then read from another
memo, dated January 1996, describing a meeting between Gates and
Stephen Case, chairman of America Online, the online service. Gates
was trying to work out an arrangement under which America Online
would feature Internet Explorer, not Netscape, in exchange for
Microsoft's promoting America Online on the Windows main screen,
the desktop.
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft employee taking notes at the meeting, Houck
reported, wrote that Case told Gates that ``Internet Explorer was
technically behind Netscape, but it's in the ballpark.'' So, Case
agreed to the arrangement, which is still in place today.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is expected to rule sometime next week on the motion for
immediate dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   As Boies completed the government's response to this motion, he
was philosophical.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no basis for a summary judgment,'' he told the judge.
``But I suppose this has served some purpose. It allowed us to tell
you what we think our case is about.''

IBM TO ANNOUNCE BREAKTHROUGH IN COMPUTER MONITORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ROB FIXMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IBM Corp. is planning to announce this week that it has achieved
a much-sought-after breakthrough in computer monitor technology, a
flat-panel screen that produces four times the resolution of
typical desktop monitors yet is driven by off-the-shelf hardware
and software components.
</P>
<P>
   The quad-resolution display screen produces images as
discernible _ and in some cases clearer _ than they are when
printed on paper.
</P>
<P>
   A prototype of the screen is set to be formally introduced on
Wednesday in Japan. It was demonstrated for journalists last week
in New York by members of IBM's research division, which developed
the device under the name Roentgen, after the physicist who
discovered X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   The Roentgen uses liquid-crystal display technology similar to
the screens on notebook computers and existing flat-panel monitors.
But it employs more than 15.7 million transistors to pack 40,000
pixels into every square inch of screen area. That is four times
the number of pixels per square inch in a standard monitor and
twice the number used in the new high-definition television screens
just entering the market. A pixel is the smallest image-forming
unit of a video display.
</P>
<P>
   The Roentgen prototype has a diagonal viewing area of 16.3
inches, about equivalent in screen size to a standard 17-inch
monitor, but is only 2.5 inches thick and weighs less than a third
of a typical cathode-ray tube monitor.
</P>
<P>
   In a demonstration last week, resolution was so sharp that a map
rendered by DeLorme's Street Atlas USA, an off-the-shelf consumer
program, clearly displayed every street in all five boroughs of New
York City on a single screen with legible type.
</P>
<P>
   For the demonstration, the development group used four standard
graphics cards configured to run in parallel under Microsoft
Windows NT 4.0 on a computer powered by a standard Intel Pentium II
microprocessor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market wants to go in that direction,'' Ed Buckingham, an
analyst with the IDG research firm, said on Friday. The big
question mark, he said, would be when, at what price and in which
market the Roentgen would be introduced. For example, he said:
``The medical market will be big for this product. The need to
produce X-rays digitally and other diagnostic tools that require
extremely high resolution mean that in medicine, price will not be
a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wisnieff, manager of IBM's advanced-display technology
laboratory, agreed that the product would initially be marketed to
industries with special needs for high-resolution displays, like
medicine, stock brokerage firms and engineering work stations. But
he said the team's goal was to design high-resolution displays
inexpensive enough to be widely adopted for consumer notebook and
desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Roentgen could easily be manufactured in the same
plants that already produce IBM's current generation of notebook
screens.
</P>
<P>
   Wisnieff said production schedules and prices had not yet been
set.
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham estimated that the Roentgen would make its way into
IBM's high-end Thinkpad notebooks in late 1999 or early 2000.

 UNDATED: other departments. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   International Paper is combing the software world for programs
it can use to monitor every step in the papermaking process, from
the time the logs come into the yard to the time the product shows
up at the customer's door _ and often beyond that, to how it
performs in use.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Tropicana, one of International Paper's big
packaging customers, occasionally complains that some of its orange
juice cartons burst as they are being trucked to food stores. In
response, International Paper electronically bugs a juice-filled
truck, collects a continuous stream of data about temperatures,
vibrations and other variables as the truck follows its normal
route, and analyzes the data to see if the juice package needs
strengthening or if trucks just need to be routed around
pothole-strewn roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working to the point that if a customer has a complaint,
we will be able to track the defective piece of paper or package
back through every step it has gone through and spot exactly what
went wrong,'' said William Richardson, manager of process control
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Paper industry experts say that most large paper companies are
chasing the same goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers don't just want products anymore, they want
information,'' said Ole Fadum, who runs a paper industry consulting
firm in Boulder, Colo., that bears his name. ``They want to know
what their suppliers have in stock; what they are scheduled to
make; what the product's exact specifications are.''
</P>
<P>
   Providing all that is a herculean task for any paper company.
But the information technology steamroller has had to flatten
particularly spiky obstacles at International Paper.
</P>
<P>
   Because it was one of the first paper companies to develop
extensive in-house computer systems, it is stuck with some of the
most cumbersome ``legacy'' systems around. As are many of its
industry brethren, it is buying huge materials-tracking and
financial systems offered by software giants like SAP, I2
Technologies and Manugistics, but it is having a much harder time
melding them with its existing systems than companies that came
later to information technology.
</P>
<P>
   There are other logistical glitches. The company has been on a
buying binge, acquiring 17 companies in the last five years alone,
and thus is faced with integrating their disparate information
systems into its own. It has also been consolidating plants and
offices. As a result, although International Paper's headquarters
are in Purchase, N.Y., Phillips' manufacturing technology group,
which serves as first port of call for the mills and product
development departments, is in Ohio. Scalet's information
technology group, which handles financial reporting, installing SAP
programs, the year 2000 conversion and customer links, is in
Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   The two technology groups meet quarterly, and the manufacturing
folks transmit streams of data to Memphis each day, but there is
little chance for ideas to spring from encounters at the water
cooler.
</P>
<P>
   That has not stopped Scalet from plunging into the manufacturing
world. He has already assigned 250 of his people to paper mills or
other International Paper departments, to see firsthand how their
processes work and what kind of help they need in getting data to
their customers.
</P>
<P>
   He is investigating ways to sell product on the Internet. And he
has jazzed up the company's internal Web page. Now, mills can use
it to swap surplus equipment, and employees can get access to work
tips _ from the most efficient way to get a stuck log out of a wood
chipper to the best way to run a company function.
</P>
<P>
   He is also making it interactive. Each month, on the chairman's
home page, employees are asked, ``If you were chairman what would
you do?'' about a particular issue and are invited to send in their
answers by e-mail. For now, senior executives respond off line.
Down the road, the company plans to post samples of the employees'
comments on the Internet and install a respond button that will
enable managers and colleagues to react to the suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the need for symbols of change, just last month
Scalet changed his group's name from Information Systems to
Information Technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet isn't a system; a telephone isn't a system,'' he
said. ``Systems can increase productivity and decrease costs.
Technologies can bring in revenues.''

ONCE THREATENED BY COMPUTERS, AN INDUSTRY ADOPTS THEM

<P>
   Picture a slurry, made of wood fiber and fillers like calcium
carbonate or clay, swimming in a sea of water so vast that the pulp
cannot form clumps. Mentally deposit it onto a wire mesh belt,
through which the water drains out at huge pressures and speed.
Feed that belt through a roller press to squeeze the rest of the
moisture out.
</P>
<P>
   Now put your mind's eye into fast forward, and feed the slurry
through the process at 4,000 feet a minute.
</P>
<P>
   That is how fast a modern machine can make copier paper. The
speed is both a blessing and a curse. The slightest variation in
filler-to-fiber ratio, in the ionic charge on the filler or in the
moisture content of the mixture can cause the machine to vibrate,
pockmarking the paper with seemingly imperceptible hills and
valleys that can jam a copier.
</P>
<P>
   And that is if the paper gets that far. Vibration and an
imbalanced formula can cause the paper to rupture on the production
line, forcing the machine to be stopped and the whole batch to be
redone.
</P>
<P>
   Such paper breaks have cost International Paper Co. $100 million
a year. But now, thanks to computerized controls and information
technology, they may soon be history.
</P>
<P>
   There is a paradox here. With $20.1 billion in sales last year,
International Paper is the biggest player in an industry that
visionaries long ago predicted would be a dinosaur in a paperless
society. Well, not only have paper sales grown steadily, but
International Paper has become a power user of the technologies
that were supposed to render it obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   At a paper plant in Selma, Ala., it has installed ultrasensitive
controls that early on can detect the slightest chemical imbalance
or machine vibration and feed the data to computers. Operators in
the control room can double click for a pull-down menu of options _
tinker with the slurry formula, perhaps, or the speed of the
machine _ to prevent anything dire from taking place.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 200 variables that can cause a problem, and even the
best operator couldn't carry them all in his head,'' said Richard
Phillips, head of International Paper's manufacturing technology
center. He notes that the enhanced controls also let International
Paper use more filler in its slurry, saving $50 million a year in
materials costs.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most paper companies are taking a high-technology
approach these days. They have to. Global papermaking capacity has
soared, and most companies are already churning out fairly
high-quality product at very low cost. Thus, the only way a paper
company can distinguish itself is through customer service, and
information systems are a prime way to provide it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This industry used to think, the smaller your information
technology budget, the better off you were,'' said L. Ronald
Raines, Ernst &AMP; Young's paper expert. ``Well, the I.T. budget in
this industry routinely goes up 30 percent to 55 percent a year.''
</P>
<P>
   The effects of that kind of spending are rampant throughout
International Paper. Is a machine spewing forth low-quality paper?
The company will comb that machine's logs for clues to what
operators did right when everything was running smoothly and what
they did wrong _ say, let the paper slurry get top heavy in some
chemicals _ just before the problem hit. And it will put the
answers into the electronic archives, so operators on similar
machines can learn how to prevent foul-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Is some remote machine malfunctioning in some mysterious way?
Trouble-shooters at the manufacturing technology headquarters in
Loveland, Ohio, will set up video links with operators in the
ailing mill, who can show them schematics of the process, real-time
production data and anything else that can enable them to diagnose
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   International Paper is not just now discovering computers, of
course. It developed the industry's first computerized controls as
a joint project with IBM Corp. nearly 40 years ago, and it has
continually fine-tuned those controls to add speed to its machines
and consistency to its products. It was also among the first to
mechanize payrolls and other back-office operations.
</P>
<P>
   But the scope of its information technology efforts has
broadened mightily in the last year. Karl Moore, its first chief
information officer, was a 38-year International Paper employee and
finance specialist whose primary goal was running the information
department as a low-cost operation aimed primarily at making
scheduling and administrative operations more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   Moore has since gone to Brussels for the company. Late last
year, John Dillon, the company's chairman and chief executive,
hired J. Chris Scalet, the current information officer, away from
Mapco Inc., an energy company, and gave him responsibility for
using computers to make money, not tons of product. ``John told me
to use technology to create a competitive advantage, to
differentiate us in the marketplace,'' Scalet said. ``And that's
meant shifting our focus from reducing costs and administrative
burdens to projects that have a real impact on the revenue side of
the house.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no easy task. It means disseminating real-time information
to operators, salespeople and, increasingly, customers. It means
letting customers buy a myriad of products with one call or
keystroke _ and sending a single invoice for all of them. It means
giving salespeople in the field electronic access to every byte of
information on orders, paper specifications, production schedules
or stocks in hand. And increasingly it means adopting fancy
security checks and systems, and then letting big customers tap
into that data themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But before facts and figures can be widely distributed, they
have to be gathered and codified. Right now, hundreds of
International Paper's computer technologists are working on systems
to insure that every plant uses the same customer and supplier
numbers and maintains common cost data. They are setting up wide
area networks so that the product specifications, production
volumes and other information that is electronically captured from
all of the company's far-flung papermaking machines can be
simultaneously disseminated to accounting, order entry and other
departments.

A CALL FOR DIGITAL SURVEILLANCE IS DELAYED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a setback for the FBI, the Federal Communications Commission
has given the telecommunications industry an additional 20 months
to comply with a federal law meant to bring law enforcement
surveillance into the digital age.
</P>
<P>
   But in extending the deadline the commission deferred action on
some of the most disputed facets of the issue, which has pitted law
enforcement officials against telephone equipment manufacturers,
network-service providers and privacy-rights advocates.
</P>
<P>
   The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, passed by
Congress in 1994, was intended to address complaints by the FBI and
local law enforcement agencies that they were rapidly losing their
ability to conduct wiretaps and other forms of electronic
surveillance in the face of modern digital and wireless
communications networks.
</P>
<P>
   But industry groups had long warned that they would be unable to
meet the approaching Oct. 25 deadline for complying with the law by
installing the software and hardware that would allow for
court-authorized surveillance on modern networks. The FCC order,
issued on Friday, extended the deadline to June 30, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said they were tentatively pleased
with the ruling _ not by the delay, but by the setting of what they
said they hoped would be a firm deadline, following months of
uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very heartened that a clear signal has been sent by the
FCC,'' said Stephen Colgate, an assistant attorney general. ``There
needs to be some finality to this process.''
</P>
<P>
   He would not comment, however, on the FCC's decision to defer
action on other issues involving the new surveillance capabilities,
saying he had not yet had an opportunity to review the entire
order.
</P>
<P>
   The order leaves unresolved some questions raised by industry
executives and privacy experts who had argued that the FBI was
using the law both to expand its wiretapping capabilities as well
as add new capabilities like the ability to track the location of
cellular telephone users and intercept Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ruling is really a prelude to the privacy fight,'' said
James Dempsey, a telecommunications expert at the Center for
Democracy and Technology, a privacy rights group in Washington.
``For now the commission has given itself and the industry some
breathing room. They've said, `Don't rush into these additional
surveillance areas.'''
</P>
<P>
   The decision came in response to a request for a deadline
extension that was filed in March in a joint petition by AT&AMP;T
Wireless Services, Lucent Technologies and Ericsson. Manufacturers
are adding features to network switching equipment that permit a
greater number of simultaneous phone calls to be monitored by law
enforcement officials and accommodate modern telephone calling
features like call forwarding and conference calling.
</P>
<P>
   FCC officials deferred their decisions on expanding the
capabilities to include providing location information in cellular
telephone networks and embracing Internet packet-switching
technology. But they did indicate their awareness that their
rulings on such matters could have a significant impact on privacy
rights in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we go forward with this important proceeding, we need to
make sure that law enforcement has the most up-to-date tools
available to catch criminals,'' William Kennard, the commission
chairman, said in a statement. ``But we need to balance the needs
of law enforcement with Americans' rights to privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   One industry representative said Friday that he was pessimistic
about the possibility in the long run of limiting law-enforcement
officials' access to user-location data on wireless networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is going to create a demand for this, and when that
happens the FBI is going to have access to that information,'' said
Stewart Baker, a lawyer in Washington who represents the cellular
telephone industry.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The current privacy dispute centers on access to computer data
that will track a cellular telephone user's location only to the
vicinity of the closest cellular network transmitter, which might
be hundreds of yards or even several miles away from the person.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of companies are now at work on powerful
technologies based on global positioning satellite, or GPS,
receivers _ as well as alternative approaches _ that might pinpoint
the user's location within 20 feet or so.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC has already mandated that cellular systems begin
providing such precise locator data for 911 emergency purposes in
2001. But manufacturers are taking various approaches to
safeguarding access to that information. Several of the systems,
for example, would generate the locator information only if the
cell-phone user switched on that capability.
</P>
<P>
   Surveillance of Internet data is also likely to become a heated
privacy issue as the FCC deliberations proceed. Because of the
nature of packet-switched networks that blend thousands of
communications streams, part of the quandary will be how to provide
law enforcement with access to only the narrowly defined stream of
data specified in a subpoena.

 UNDATED: to buy.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anecdotal evidence would suggest that local businesses are
indeed coming online, selling everything from clothing and
computers to hotel rooms and vacation packages, and realizing a
decent return on their investment.
</P>
<P>
   Sal Patel, reservations manager at the 70-room Union Square
Hotel, says his monthly listing in Citysearch San Francisco
typically pays for itself within a day or two.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts predict the pace of development of new online city
guides will probably not last long. Despite all the interest from
advertisers, no city guide has consistently shown a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing isolated incidents where these sites are making
money,'' said Peter Kraslinsky, an analyst at Arlen Communication,
a research company that studies interactive transactions. ``But
mostly they're spending with minimal returns.''
</P>
<P>
   Many producers of online guides acknowledge that the effort has
proved a more expensive proposition than they expected. Musk says
that by hooking up with major media players, Zip2 expects to be
profitable sooner than the companies that try to do the bulk of the
editorial work themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Though the demand for local information and services is huge, it
is anybody's guess how many competing services each market can
support and whether the services can turn investments into profits.
Lisa Allen, a new-media analyst at Forrester Research, said,
``Becoming a media operation and making money at it are a lot
easier said than done.''

THE REAL INTERNET ACTION IS LOCAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.

603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.) 
 By LAURIE J. FLYNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget all the talk about the global, freewheeling Internet.
Nearly two years after the first online city guides appeared, many
companies are still betting that the real action on the Internet is
in such local online markets.
</P>
<P>
   From its start, the business of producing locally oriented Web
sites that offer everything from concert listings and restaurant
reviews to commuter traffic reports and school lunch menus, has
been one of the Internet's fiercest battlegrounds. Some cities
boast as many as half a dozen full-blown Web sites clamoring for a
share of local advertising, media support and loyal users.
</P>
<P>
   The lure is tempting indeed. Local businesses in the United
States will spend a total of $70 billion on advertising this year.
Of that, says Jupiter Communications, the Internet research firm in
New York, $700 million will be spent online, a figure that analysts
say will almost double in 1999 and will continue to rise well into
the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, not all the local Web guides that have sprung up can
survive in markets crowded with nearly indistinguishable
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Already the business has shown signs of cracking. Earlier this
year Microsoft Corp. was forced back to the labs for a new approach
to its network of local guides, Streets, laying off a quarter of
its editorial staff in the meantime. Likewise, America Online's
Digital City has regrouped in a process that cut 80 staff members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those areas where you have too many people doing
close to the same thing,'' Patrick Keane, an analyst at Jupiter
Communications, said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there have been few real casualties, and new
partnerships are leading to new sites and new business strategies
every day. Most recently, for example, Citysearch, a pioneer in the
city guides, merged with the Ticketmaster unit of USA Networks with
the idea of more closely integrating event listings with the
ability to sell tickets immediately to the events.
</P>
<P>
   With the Citysearch/Ticketmaster union, someone interested in
seeing ``Titanic'' on the big screen would be able to find out
where it was playing and then instantly buy a ticket. Eventually,
consumers will also be offered many related transactions at the
same time, like the opportunity to buy Titanic memorabilia and make
reservations at a restaurant near the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Though services like these have long been promised by local
guides, no company has yet delivered all the pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Citysearch, of Pasadena, Calif., is in a quiet period as it
prepares to go public, so executives were not available for
interviews. But the merger with Ticketmaster last month is perhaps
the best signal yet that online guides are quickly moving from
simply providing information to performing transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most notable local online activity recently has been
in the newspaper business, where an aggressive upstart, Zip2, has
managed to forge partnerships with 160 papers around the United
States. Twenty of those deals have led to full-scale city guides,
said Elon Musk, chairman and founder of Zip2, which is based in
Mountain View, Calif. The remaining deals have produced local
guides within newspapers' Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Among the full-scale guides is New York Today, a result of a
partnership between Zip2 and The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   One of the primary things Zip2 provides newspapers with is an
online Yellow Pages with links directly into store listings and
reviews. Zip2 also offers a personalization feature, calendar
listings and free e-mail. Through a deal with Zip2, The Boston
Globe, a New York Times Co. newspaper, offers event and local
information as a part of Boston.com, the regional Web site it
created in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts agree that local newspapers could have an inherent
advantage in the local online market because they can tap material
they already develop for print and use the strength of their brand
to attract both advertisers and customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always said it's the newspaper industry's battle to
lose,'' said Keane of Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   Citysearch has also linked up with newspapers, including The Los
Angeles Times, which is owned by Times Mirror Co., and Time Out New
York, a weekly arts and entertainment magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Star, owned by Torstar Corp., is working with
Citysearch and Tele-Direct, a local phone company that supplies
Yellow Pages listings. Likewise, in the crowded New York market,
Microsoft Sidewalk licenses entertainment listings from The Village
Voice.
</P>
<P>
   The most innovative newspaper effort may be the Real Cities
network started a year ago by Knight Ridder, publisher of a chain
that includes The Miami Herald, The Philadelphia Inquirer and The
San Jose Mercury News. The idea is to give online media buyers a
network for placing local Web ads, while giving the Web sites
access to editorial material and tools like the News Hound program,
which delivers news personalized to the needs of each user.
</P>
<P>
   Knight Ridder's strategy is similar to that of Cox Enterprises,
which last year opened a series of Web sites based on its newspaper
and television properties.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the greatest competitive threat comes from one of
the Internet's oldest properties, Yahoo, which offers links to
local content and has become the front door for millions of
Internet users. Though Yahoo's half-dozen local sites do not offer
much in the way of original content, they do carry brand
recognition and an already captive audience, which might prove
crucial in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the real battle is with Yahoo and AOL to become a
local portal,'' Musk, of Zip2, said. ``They're building down to the
local level, whereas we're building up to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Microsoft and America Online, despite their perceived
missteps, appear to be gearing up for the fight again. Microsoft
Sidewalk, now published in nine cities, is readying Version 3.0 of
its service for roll-out by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to offer a national version in which much of the
content will be identical from one city site to another but will be
supplemented by local information about restaurants, performances
and retailers and will carry a combination of local and national
ads.
</P>
<P>
   The new Sidewalk will place a greater emphasis on helping
consumers shop, including the addition of Yellow Pages, said the
service's product manager, Gayle Troberman.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Atkins, Sidewalk's general manager for advertising sales
and marketing, said, ``More and more merchants want to come online
and reach people right when they want to buy.''

   1. PROCOL HARUM'S GARY BROOKER ROCKS ON It's 32 years since
Procol Harum appeared on the rock scene with its first recording,
``A Whiter Shade of Pale.'' Now the band's lead singer and pianist,
Gary Brooker, is living the life of a rock legend, recording and
touring with the likes of Ringo Starr, Bill Wyman, George Harrison,
Eric Clapton and Peter Frampton. Brooker talks about Procol Harum,
the life of a rock-era survivor, what it's like to work with Starr
and Wyman, and why Procol Harum refused an invitation to perform at
Woodstock in 1969. By Tito Davila. 1,400 words + photo. 2. JONI
MITCHELL UNLEASHES 'TIGER' Joni Mitchell, who was considering
retirement from the vagaries of a fickle music business only a year
ago, has invested her latest album, ``Taming The Tiger,'' with a
newfound passion and optimism that has even the artist herself
feeling hopeful about its prospects. ``My prejudices against
popularity are many, but I'm trying to get bigger,'' says Mitchell.
``I like the way this record turned out, plus my stock has risen
lately with Janet Jackson sampling me in her hit ``Go'Til It's
Gone.'' More heads are turning at airports these days. I haven't
even peaked yet.'' By Carrie Bell. Billboard. 1,000 words.

Francois Truffaut was asked to name his favourite director at the
1980 San Francisco Film Festival, he immediately replied, ``I don't
know his name, but I saw his picture last night. It is called ``The
Stuntman.'' Within weeks, other movie buffs would come to know the
name of Richard Rush and The Stuntman earned three Academy Award

ADVERTISING: PRIVACY IN CYBERSPACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Advertisers and agencies involved in aiming online
sales pitches at children are being exhorted to toughen their
policies for protecting privacy or suffer the consequences of
growing demands from parents and government officials for
restrictive regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Those stern warnings were heard on Friday at a daylong
conference at the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan that was
described by its organizers as a ``guide to safe harbors and sound
practices online.'' The conference, the third of its kind, was
sponsored by the Children's Advertising Review Unit, an
organization that is a crucial part of Madison Avenue's longtime
efforts to resolve disputes about advertising without outside
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done a pretty good job so far,'' Elizabeth Lascoutx,
vice president and director for the children's unit, said in her
opening remarks to the 85 people at the conference. ``But we have a
long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about privacy in cyberspace are intensifying as sites
for children proliferate on the World Wide Web. There are
increasing consumer perceptions that many marketers are reluctant
to address problems like the overzealous collection of personally
identifiable information from young computer users and the porous
handling of such data.
</P>
<P>
   ``One site is asking kids for their Social Security numbers,''
Parry Aftab, a lawyer who specializes in interactive issues, said
in her keynote speech. ``How frustrating is that?''
</P>
<P>
   Those involved in the children's Internet market ought to be
``joining forces and writing a privacy page so kids know what to
give out and not give out,'' said Ms. Aftab, the author of ``A
Parents' Guide to the Internet ... And How to Protect Your
Children'' (SC Press, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to find a workable solution,'' she added, ``or we'll
lose the wonderful wealth of creativity and content that sites can
offer.''
</P>
<P>
   The advocacy of self-regulation by the children's unit had been
echoed enthusiastically by the Clinton administration, which sent
Ira Magaziner, the president's Internet adviser, to the 1997
conference to applaud efforts to establish voluntary guidelines to
police online peddling to youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   But in June, a report from the Federal Trade Commission said
legislation might be required because violations of children's
privacy online were discouragingly frequent and safeguards were
woefully absent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not suggesting the advertising industry attracts none but
the truly altruistic,'' said Walter O'Brien, president of the
National Advertising Review Council, which administers the
children's unit along with the Council of Better Business Bureaus
and three industry organizations. ``But it's enlightened
self-interest to make a commitment to ethical advertising,
particularly to children under 12.''
</P>
<P>
   And last month, the FTC accused Geocities, a company known for
offering members access to so-called virtual neighborhoods, of
ignoring the privacy policy posted on its site and engaging in
misleading practices that included disseminating information
gathered from children.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to look very far to see a fundamental mistake
there, a mistake we cannot make anymore,'' said John Kamp, senior
vice president at the American Association of Advertising Agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``In legal terms, it's called fraud,'' he added with a smile.
``In general terms, it's called `Do you know what you're doing?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The more our customers trust us, the more we succeed in
developing the relationships with them that make our Web sites
work,'' Kamp said. ``Privacy is the great opportunity to
distinguish ourselves from our competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Kamp's organization is one of the three involved with the
children's unit; the others are the American Advertising Federation
and the Association of National Advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC ``has been very supportive of self-regulation in
children's advertising,'' said Toby Milgrom Levin, a lawyer with
the commission who worked on the Geocities case. ``We recognize
that the advertising industry did rise to the occasion and develop
conventions to protect children from deceptive and overreaching
ads.''
</P>
<P>
   But the belief that advertisers are dawdling about the Internet
is likely to lead Congress to act, she said, and ``there may well
be hearings by the end of the month'' on a bill that ``authorizes
the FTC to prescribe regulations to protect the privacy of children
under 16.''
</P>
<P>
   To forestall legislation, ``you can make privacy a front-burner
concern,'' Ms. Levin advised, especially among top management.
``The Webmasters are not in a position to make privacy happen,''
she added.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, more of those involved in putting up Web sites are
becoming sensitized to privacy matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Privacy is in the forefront of all our programming
decisions,'' said Tina Sharkey, vice president and general manager
of the CTW Online unit of the Children's Television Workshop in New
York, which plans to introduce Monday a redesigned site called the
CTW Family Workshop (www.ctw.org).
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't collect information from children under 13,'' she
added, at areas on the site that are sponsored by marketers like
Ford Motor Co. and Kellogg Co. ``And parents are told everywhere
they can sign up that they can opt out with a `click here.'''
</P>
<P>
   More than one speaker referred to the timing of the conference,
coming as it did while computer users caused some Internet gridlock
in searching for the report on President Clinton by the Whitewater
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``If any group in this country understands the danger of private
information going public and having an impact on their lives,''
said Dan Jaffe, executive vice president at the Association of
National Advertisers, ``it's our politicians.''

TECHNOLOGY: DOES INTERNET USE CAUSE DEPRESSION? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Kraut, co-author of a new study linking depression with
Internet use, sounded a bit depressed himself last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was finished with this,'' Kraut, a professor of
social psychology and human-computer interaction at Carnegie Mellon
University, said with a sigh. He was alluding to the flood of
attention _ and criticism _ that his study, titled ``Home Net,''
had received since it was published two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1995, ``Home Net'' researchers gave PCs and free
Internet accounts to 169 people in 73 families in the Pittsburgh
area. After monitoring their online behavior, in some cases for
more than two years, the researchers concluded that spending time
on the Internet was associated with statistically significant
increases in depression and loneliness.
</P>
<P>
   Critics assert that the study has fatal flaws that neutralize
its findings and that they are appalled at the authors'
far-reaching conclusions about the impact the findings might have
on Internet policy and technology development.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Hoffman, a Vanderbilt University professor and outspoken
critic of Internet research design, was unequivocal about the
``Home Net'' study.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speaking as an editor, if this had crossed my desk, I would
have rejected it,'' said Ms. Hoffman, who edits the journal
Marketing Science. ``The mistakes are so bad that they render the
results fairly close to meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those mistakes, she said, were the absence of two standard
safeguards: a control group and random selection of subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``With `Home Net,' we don't know for sure what led to their
results,'' Ms. Hoffman said of the lack of a control group,
``because we don't know what happened to people who weren't using
the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the study recruited people from high schools and
community service organizations, instead of selecting people
randomly from a large area. Random selection is crucial to building
a truly representative sample of a population _ in this case,
residents of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that one hour a week online led to small but
measurable increases in depression and loneliness and loss of
friendships. While those measurements might well be statistically
significant, critics assert that without a random sample, they are
meaningless outside the group that was studied.
</P>
<P>
   ''The assertions have no statistical relevance to any population
of Internet users beyond those in the study population _ even in
principle,'' declared Charles Brownstein, a former director at the
National Science Foundation, now an executive director at the
Corporation for National Research Initiatives in Reston, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Although research studies do not always have to use control
groups or randomly chosen participants to be valid, Ms. Hoffman
said, those safeguards become imperative ``when you're doing a
study that claims causal relationships and that these relationships
hold in the larger population.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Home Net'' team clearly made such claims. For example, the
news release stated that ``Carnegie Mellon Study Reveals Negative
Potential of Heavy Internet Use on Emotional Well Being,'' and even
suggested that parents move PCs out of teen-agers' bedrooms and
into shared family rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Kraut was quoted extensively in the release, with such
statements as, ``We were surprised to find that what is a social
technology has such anti-social consequences.'' Also: ``Our results
have clear implications for further research on personal Internet
use. As we understand the reasons for the declines in social
involvement, there will be implications for social policies and for
the design of Internet technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Kraut wearily defended his study. ``In 1995, we did
start with a control group, but it was very hard to keep it, with
little in the way of incentives for them to continue to fill out
questionnaires,'' he said. ``And we couldn't use a random sample
because of the nature of the study's design _ we wanted to be able
to include groups who already had social connections with each
other so we could observe some shifting, if it was going to occur,
between existing social relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite criticism of the researchers' methods, he said that
the study was widely applicable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have changes big enough that they aren't likely to have
occurred on the basis of chance,'' Kraut said. ``There is something
here to explain.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics like Ms. Hoffman look askance at such results, given
her experience debunking other Internet studies, including one from
Neilsen Media Research in which she participated in 1996 and
another in 1995 in which Marty Rimm, a graduate student in Carnegie
Mellon's College of Engineering, published a study purporting to
show that the Internet was overrun with pornography.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of Rimm's study, though based on false premises and
quickly discredited, was profound. The resulting furor in the media
and in Congress helped bring about the Communications Decency Act,
which the Supreme Court ruled was a violation of the First
Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Critics fear that the ``Home Net'' study might end up having a
similar effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to imagine the results of this study being used to
influence policy decisions about Internet access, especially in
controversial funding decisions for schools and libraries,'' Ms.
Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Ms. Hoffman said, protecting the Internet itself
is not the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to protect the standard of research,'' she said.
``This isn't obscure ivory-tower stuff that never sees the light of
day. It has an impact on people's lives. If we're going to the
trouble to study the Internet, at least we should make sure we're
doing it right.''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 UNDATED: computer networks. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the World Wide Web is vaunted for enabling computer users
to do many of those same tasks, anyone who has used the available
search engines will attest to the need for much greater precision _
especially if the Internet is being used for business and not for
recreation. Novell contends that Netware Directory Services can
meet that need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our advantage is in the directory space, and no one realizes
how important that advantage is,'' said Prows, the programmer.
</P>
<P>
   And even though Microsoft is known to be adding its own
electronic white pages, called Active Directory, to its next
version of NT, industry reports are already indicating that the
directory does not ``scale up,'' or support a growing number of
users, as well as Novell's. That could be seen as a distinct
drawback to network managers, who may need a directory to scale up
to manage tens of thousands of computers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is not a showdown with Microsoft that Novell is seeking
so much as way to expand into the Internet market in ways that
avoid such a head-on confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt said he still remembered the diplomatic tour of the
industry he took soon after joining Novell and the courtesy call he
made to Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Wash. ``What should we
do?'' Schmidt recalls asking about Novell's travails.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft executives were politely noncommittal, although
later one of Microsoft's top technical leaders said of the meeting
with Schmidt, ``All I could think of was to give him a gun to shoot
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   But lately, Microsoft seems to be taking Novell more seriously.
Recently in private meetings, Microsoft's president, Steven
Ballmer, has indicated that Novell is now one of the software
giant's most closely watched competitors.
</P>
<P>
   For Major, the issues remind him of the earlier battles that
Novell fought _ and lost _ against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a mindset there of killing everyone who's opposed to
you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, having learned the folly of confronting Microsoft
directly, Major intends to use the vast expanse of the Internet to
step over, under and around his giant rival.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At Novell Inc.'s headquarters in Provo, Utah, in a valley
beneath the Wasatch Mountains, employees like to tease the chief
scientist, Drew Major, for his habit of bringing a portable
computer to meetings and writing software code while others drone
on.
</P>
<P>
   The teasers notwithstanding, Major's habit is one that remains
essential if Novell is to back away from the financial precipice,
where until recently it has found itself isolated in an
increasingly Microsoft-centric computing world.
</P>
<P>
   Major knows that Novell, which once dominated the market for
office personal computer networking software but has lately seemed
in danger of becoming technologically irrelevant, may now have its
best opportunity in years. On Monday it plans to announce the
availability of a new version of its flagship product, Netware, a
month ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The timing is crucial because just last month the Microsoft
Corp. announced that its intended Netware killer _ Windows NT 5.0 _
would not reach the market anytime soon, and analysts are saying
the program may end up arriving next summer or even later, a year
behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's slip, coming on the heels of a third-quarter
earnings report by Novell that was better than expected, has buoyed
Major's belief that the company has found a new lease on life and a
new identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a Microsoft wannabe,'' he said recently during an
interview at the company's corporate campus in Provo. But now, he
said, Novell understands that ``we have to be who we are, and that
is an independent maker of a specialized operating system.''
</P>
<P>
   Major, 48, has already seen both the mountaintop and the valley.
One of the company's first three employees in 1982, he lived and
worked through Novell's phenomenal growth period during the '80s
and then stuck around through the bitter times since the early
'90s, when Ray Noorda, the company's longtime chairman until 1994,
began confronting Microsoft directly with a broad range of
corporate software products _ and failed.
</P>
<P>
   Now Major, the leader of the company's once-demoralized
engineering ranks, contends that Novell has found a way to once
again thrive in Microsoft's long shadow. On a blackboard in a
windowless conference room in the company's headquarters is a long
list of new products designed to make it easier to use the
Internet, which Major contends will give customers renewed reasons
to buy Novell software.
</P>
<P>
   There are already some hopeful signs. After cutting the work
force by 18 percent last year, to 4,600 employees, the company
reported a fiscal third-quarter profit of $27 million last month,
compared with a $122 million loss in the quarter a year earlier.
And test versions of Netware 5.0, the new version of its mainstay
product, have received accolades from trade-press reviewers.
</P>
<P>
   Even better news is that a 15 percent growth in sales of the
existing version of Netware in the most recent quarter suggests
that the computer market is interpreting the Windows NT 5.0 delay
as a signal to renew its commitment to Novell, which lost its
market share advantage over Microsoft last year in the business of
providing software that powers networks of desktop and central
``server'' computers.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts are saying that Microsoft's technology snags,
which they predict could delay the arrival of Windows NT 5.0 until
next summer or later, will give Novell much-needed breathing room _
and an opportunity to consolidate its hold over the 40 million
Netware users.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netware 5.0 is here and Microsoft is not,'' said Steven Dube,
a Wall Street analyst at Wasserstein, Perella &AMP; Co. ``That has
become a major factor.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a true turnaround, Eric Schmidt, the former Sun
Microsystems technologist who replaced Robert Frankenberg as
Novell's chief executive in April 1997, would no doubt receive and
deserve much of the credit. But a corporate revival would be just
as much the story of the renewed professional passion of Major, who
remains the technological soul of Novell.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the technical ranks of the company, Major still maintains
a reputation as a software engineer who has long emphasized
technical efficiency as the best way to achieve product performance
_ continuously striving to reduce delays between the network and
the hard disk of individual computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drew is all about speed and performance,'' said Kent Prows, a
Novell engineer. ``His legacy is that Netware now offers the
fastest path between the wire and the disk.''
</P>
<P>
   While Microsoft's NT 5.0 has already ballooned to about 45
million lines of code because of Microsoft's effort to make the
program all things to all users, Netware is still less than a
fourth that size. Industry engineers say the size advantage is
almost certain to translate into a speed advantage.
</P>
<P>
   That should help Major and his technical team carry out
Schmidt's strategy _ a plan that goes beyond improving Netware's
performance in office networks by trying to improve the performance
of the entire Internet for corporate customers and Internet service
providers. To supplement Major's team, Schmidt has been quietly
recruiting new talent, much of it reflecting the aggressive,
technology-first Silicon Valley engineering culture embodied by
companies like Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a little piracy here,'' said Mike Sheridan, who
recently left Sun for Novell, referring to the swashbuckling,
take-no-prisoners attitude affected by the team that developed
Sun's Java Internet programming language under Schmidt.
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan is now leading a small team of Novell programmers who
are building applications for the company's Netware Directory
Services software _ already a highly regarded piece of Netware.
Novell executives have come to consider it the company's most
valuable asset, and they are intent on making it an Internet
standard.
</P>
<P>
   Directory software is the equivalent of electronic white pages,
which enable computer users and other software programs to find
other users, databases and resources in large computer networks.

PATENTS: SOLVING COMPUTING PROBLEMS WITH DNA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four years ago, Dr. Leonard Adleman raised the exciting
possibility of DNA-powered supercomputers when he wrote in the
journal Science that he had solved a computational problem
essentially by stirring up some DNA in a test tube, using building
blocks of DNA as computing symbols.
</P>
<P>
   The technique, in concept, involves the use of DNA _ strands of
genetic code _ as a stand-in for computer software code.
</P>
<P>
   Adleman, a professor at the University of Southern California,
set up his problem by synthesizing DNA in a certain sequence and
then letting DNA molecules react in a test tube so they ultimately
produce a molecule whose sequence is the answer to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   He used the chemical units of DNA rather than electronic 1s and
0s to solve a single, relatively simple problem: figuring out the
shortest distance someone would have to travel to visit a number of
different cities _ similar to a standard math problem referred to
as the ``traveling salesman tour problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But last week Dr. Warren Smith and Dr. Allan Schweitzer, two
scientists at the NEC Research Institute in Princeton, N.J.,
received what appears to be the first patent covering a DNA
computing process that at least theoretically can solve not just a
single problem but a broad array of problems, just as a
conventional desktop computer might.
</P>
<P>
   The patent describes a way to concoct a vat of DNA molecules
that have been manipulated by standard biotechnology techniques _
such as the cutting, splicing and growing of DNA strands _ to
behave like miniature computers.
</P>
<P>
   All these molecular-size computers would operate in parallel,
with each one exploring different possible computational paths to
solve a problem, potentially speeding up computing time greatly.
</P>
<P>
   The patent details a way to use genetic material to construct a
large number of what are called Turing machines, all running in
parallel, with each exploring different possible computational
paths. (A Turing machine is a theoretical construct, first proposed
in 1937 by the British computer scientist Alan Turing, that
provides the schematic outline upon which digital computers are
based.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the new patent, Smith does not sound optimistic these
days about the patented technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the DNA molecules do the right step,'' he said in an
interview, describing the process. ``But then some other fraction
just dissolve and get flushed down the drain.''
</P>
<P>
   This and other problems lead to an exponential buildup in errors
during the calculations. In addition, the operations of this DNA
computing so far are slow-going, taking hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does appear to be the first patent to issue in this
area,'' said David Waltz, an NEC vice president. ``But will this be
the basis of a new industry, and will everyone have to take out a
license on it in the future? That's not so clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Schweitzer received patent number 5,804,373.

A DAMAGED DISK? THE DOCTOR IS IN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY   
 c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I am very disappointed in Win98. It will not
recognize my modem at all. Dial-Up Networking will not let me type
in the name of my server. My Internet provider tells me it's a
Win98 problem and I will have to talk to Microsoft. Well, I can't
find an 800-number for them, and I got so mad that I damaged my
disk. So, what can you do for me, Doc?
</P>
<P>
   _ Mad at Microsoft
</P>
<P>
   DEAR MAD: Here, have some of this nice Thorazine and think about
fluffy bunnies. ...
</P>
<P>
   When you're nice and relaxed, go look at how your hardware is
set up. Dial-Up Networking is not going to work at all until
Windows successfully recognizes your modem.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the modem itself is OK, make sure its communications
port and interrupt settings don't conflict with anything else
already installed. Open the Programs menu, go to Accessories, then
System Tools, and pick System Information. Check under Resources
for any conflicts to see if you need to change your modem's
settings. Yeah, I know, that means getting out the manual, but
sometimes it just can't be helped. Put down that entrenching tool,
please.
</P>
<P>
   If there's no conflict, the modem driver may need to be
reinstalled or updated. If you haven't already crushed your modem
installation disk in a bench vise, follow the instructions that
came with it. Otherwise, find a friend who's not afraid of you to
download a new driver from the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   You might also get your friend to surf over to
support.microsoft.com for technical help, because you're not going
to find an 800-number, at least not without paying for a Microsoft
service plan. However, they do offer free phone support for Windows
in the United States at (425) 635-7222, 8 a.m.-8 p.m. weekdays.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, after you've replaced your Windows CD, do yourself a
favor for that next moment of blind rage _ trust me, it will come.
Copy everything in the Win98 folder, including sub-folders, to your
hard drive. Once these installation files are on the drive, you'll
never need to run screaming maniacally through the neighborhood
because you can't find the CD. Well, unless you accidentally jammed
an ice pick through the hard drive, that is.
</P>
<P>
   STUPID SOFTWARE TRICK: A tip o' the fez to Earl Hamilton for
sending in this Excel 95 trick:
</P>
<P>
   Open a new file. Click on the Row 95 button to highlight the
row, then press Tab to move to the second column. Click on Help,
then ``About Microsoft Excel.'' As you hold down the Alt, Control
and Shift keys, click on the Tech Support button.
</P>
<P>
   A window titled ``The Hall of Tortured Souls'' opens, allowing
you to explore a Doom-like environment. Check out the names of the
Excel developers scrolling down the wall, then walk up the ramp,
come back down, face the blank wall at the end of the room and type
EXCELKFA. A secret passage opens. Follow the zig-zag trail without
falling off for a really weird and unusual sight.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's probably not as weird or unusual as programmers
actually working on what they're supposed to be working on.
</P>

DESKTOP STUDIO FOR HOME VIDEO BUFFS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (The Science Times)  
 By ROB FIXMER   
 .1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a few notable exceptions like the stuff that ends up on
``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' most family movies and tapes
are destined to the oblivion of those dresser drawers that collect
the pressed flowers and love beads of our youth.
</P>
<P>
   There is no mystery to this. Home videos are typically painfully
packed with jiggled-camera shots and endless feet of boring images.
Yet, most contain a few gems within their 120 minutes of raw
footage that are worth savoring from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the market for Studio 400, a $200 peripheral from
Pinnacle Systems of Sunnyvale, Calif., that enables people with
Pentium-class computers running Windows 95 or 98 to edit home
videos into movies that are actually worth watching.
</P>
<P>
   No one who has used a professional Macintosh-based video editing
system like the Avid would ever be satisfied with the Studio 400.
Yet, with enough patience and just a touch of creativity, this
product can help you fashion a first-rate production from the
visual chaos of your home videos.
</P>
<P>
   And if your objective is to produce videos for a Web site, the
Studio 400 is probably a wiser investment than a professional
system. Its lack of sophistication is not a drawback for making
short clips, and the quality of its output far exceeds the current
state of the art in online movies.
</P>
<P>
   That said, do not rush out and buy this device unless you are
absolutely sure you have the required equipment to make it work _
and that you are willing to suffer through the extreme hassles of
setting it up and disassembling it.
</P>
<P>
   The most important requirement is the right kind of camcorder.
It basically has to be a Sony or one of the very few camcorders
from other companies that use the Sony LANC system. LANC, commonly
referred to as ``Control L,'' is a set of communications rules that
Sony cameras use to send and receive instructions like start, stop,
record and pause. Unless you already own such a camcorder or are
willing to buy one, the Studio 400 will be useless.
</P>
<P>
   (Pinnacle Systems also claims to support a few camcorders that
can be controlled with an infrared remote or a Panasonic 5-pin
jack, only used abroad. For this review, only a Sony camcorder was
used.)
</P>
<P>
   You will also need a VCR that can be controlled by a standard
infrared remote. That covers virtually all VCR's, but unless your
computer just happens to be sitting right next to your television,
you will have to unplug the VCR and move it.
</P>
<P>
   Before doing this, consider that when unplugged, most VCR's lose
anything stored in their memory, which will have be reset. And if
your VCR requires using an on-screen menu to switch it from cable
or antenna reception to accepting input from a camcorder, you will
also have to attach a television to the VCR during the setup
process.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will you be able to use your VCR or camcorder when it is
connected to the system.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, installing Studio 400 leaves you with a jumble of
eight cables, at least two of which are not supplied and will have
to be hunted down. The unit itself _ a box about 6.5 inches by 4.5
inches and 2 inches called the studio mixer _ must be plugged into
a computer's parallel and serial ports and into a parallel printer
unless you have more than one printer port.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you are willing to go through the expense of making the
Studio 400 a semi-permanent installation by dedicating a VCR and
camcorder to the system, setting up for each editing session will
take about an hour.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, you can do without the VCR and save your finished
movies directly on your hard drive _ but only if you have about a
gigabyte of space for a half-hour movie that plays on the PC
screen.
</P>
<P>
   There are other drawbacks. The connection to your parallel port
is supposed to let you run your printer at the same time, but when
either of two popular ink-jet printers _ a Canon BJC 4000 or an
Epson 600 _ was attached to Studio 400, neither worked properly.
Nor could the computer find a Zip drive that had been attached via
the parallel port. Two hours of playing with the port settings,
rebooting and re-initializing printers never fixed the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, once set up, Studio 400 turned out to be a useful tool
that enables you to control both your camcorder and VCR from your
computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   The first step is to capture the images from a tape on the
camcorder and save them on your hard drive. At this step, the
system employs heavy compression so that the images use little disk
space _ about 150 megabytes for every hour of video. These images
only have to be good enough to let you see what you will be editing
and can be discarded after the movie is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, it is easiest to capture the video from an entire
tape, but you can monitor the action on screen as the tape plays
and start and stop the camcorder to select only portions you want
to use. As the video is captured, Studio 400 recognizes scene
changes and pops the first frame of each scene into an ``album'' on
your computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   Next you choose the scenes you want and arrange them in order by
dragging the first frame of a scene from the album into a cell on a
``story board.'' You then choose fades, cuts and other ways that
one scene blends into another from a respectable selection of
effects and drag them to their desired spot on the story board.
</P>
<P>
   Studio 400 also enables you to create titles and subtitles.
While title animation is limited, the text can be moved in and out
of scenes nicely using the transition effects.
</P>
<P>
   The editing is completed by switching from the story board to a
timeline view of the movie. At this point you can shorten or
rearrange scenes, add sound effects, narration and background music
and fine-tune transitions. Music can be cued to the exact length of
the movie or of individual scenes.
</P>
<P>
   When editing is finished, Studio 400 completes the movie by
reading its instructions from your timeline. For each scene, it
cues the camcorder to the first frame, copies the scene to the VCR,
then pauses the VCR, finds the first frame of the next scene and
repeats the process until the entire movie is assembled on the
videotape in your VCR. At each step, it adds the titles, transition
effects and sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on your creativity and patience and the quality of the
videos, the result can be surprisingly professional _ or just
another, very expensive artifact for your dresser drawer.

 Shopping for cars made easy on Internet  
By John Ghirardini  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most unpleasant tasks known to man is shopping for a
car. For most of us, this endeavor ranks only slightly above root
canals.
</P>
<P>
   Some studies have shown more than 60 percent of consumers
flat-out hate the car shopping and buying process. First there's
all the schlepping around to various dealers spread all over the
metro area. Then there's the compromise on a model that doesn't
have quite all the features or options you'd like. Last, there's
the negotiations with the smooth salesperson who often could make a
shark feel uncomfortable _ at least during the times your offer
isn't being ``taken to my manager.''
</P>
<P>
   Once you've signed on the dotted line, there's always the
nagging feeling you've been taken anyway.
</P>
<P>
   That's been eased some by the car dealers who maintain a
no-haggle set price, but what if you don't want a Saturn?
</P>
<P>
   Next time, let your mouse do the shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Several sites on the World Wide Web are devoted to helping
consumers with everything from negotiating a price to actually
completing the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   As the average price for new vehicles has hit $20,000 over the
last few years, the used-car market has mushroomed into a $365
billion behemoth. More than 40 million used cars changed hands last
year; new-car sales were about 15 million, according to a study
done this year by Leiberman Research Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   AutoConnect (http://www.autoconnect.com) is one of the new breed
of ``cyber middlemen'' _ online retail portals that connect buyers
and sellers. In the case of AutoConnect, the service is free to
both.
</P>
<P>
   The site features a comprehensive and detailed database of
nearly 500,000 used vehicles, searchable by make, model, type
(truck, car or van, for instance), price, Blue Book value and
geographic proximity. When a shopper finds the '39 Nash or '92
Mercedes of his or her dreams, AutoConnect gives them several ways
to contact the dealer or private seller directly. The site also
features photos of many of the vehicles, side-by-side comparisons,
articles on insurance and maintenance, and calculators for figuring
out loan payments or comparing loan vs. lease.
</P>
<P>
   AutoConnect's primary focus is on used vehicles, but comparison
information and dealer lists are available for new-car shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   If you've got a yen for a brand-new set of wheels, here are a
couple of other sites to check out:
</P>
<P>
   AutoVantage (http://www.cuc.com/ctg/cgi-bin/AutoSavings
</P>
<P>
   /home?ref &QC; ). The site maintains information from a network of
2,300 dealers, and can steer you to the best deal for buying or
leasing in your neck of the woods.
</P>
<P>
   Auto BuySmart (http://www.autobuysmart.com/howitwrk
</P>
<P>
   .htm) is a new-car buying service that basically does all the
work and haggling for a $295 fee _ cheap compared with the price of
a car and reduction of wear and tear on your psyche.
</P>
<P>
   If you decide to fight the good fight yourself, go into the
battle forearmed. Take a look at the Beat the Car Salesman site
(http://www.beat-the.com
</P>
<P>
   /beat-the-car-salesman/), which bills itself as ``the car
salesman's worst nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   The site is actually the online companion to a book by the same
name, but contains valuable information in its own right.
</P>
<P>
   Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines.

INTERNET AWASH WITH SPECULATION ABOUT CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ERIN McCORMICK   
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The release of the Whitewater independent
counsel's report on President Clinton has the Internet buzzing with
sordid discussions, lurid speculation and debate about the merits
of punishing a public figure for a private sexual affair.
</P>
<P>
   One Internet betting pool has offered up to $5,000 to the person
who can correctly guess the date on which President Clinton might
leave office.
</P>
<P>
   An on-line chat group encouraged users to vote on which of 27
outcomes would seal the president's future, offering choices that
included impeachment and Clinton suffering a heart attack, and thus
gaining public sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   And members of an on-line support group for people suffering
from depression frantically exchanged messages about where they
could find Kenneth Starr's report on Clinton's sexual adventures.
</P>
<P>
   As the scathing report hit the World Wide Web Friday, thousands
of Internet users responded by pouring their outrage, their
anguish, their support and, more prevalently, their cynicism onto
the information superhighway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having just read it, Clinton should resign immediately,'' one
user said in a message posted to a discussion group on current
news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looks to me like Starr's a Rush Limbaugh type, who thinks the
prez is a naturally evil person who can be brought down with
unsubstantial allegations,'' another Internet user wrote to a stock
investors newsgroup.
</P>
<P>
   And then there were the smart alecks, who seemed to outnumber
those with serious comments 10-1.
</P>
<P>
   One member of a discussion group suggested Clinton try to
portray his sexual promiscuity as an illness that might fall under
the Americans with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can NOT impeach Clinton. It's very simple,'' the pundit
wrote in a newsgroup on politics. ``Clinton clearly has a sexual
addiction. That is a psychological disorder, and therefore a
disability. ... And you can not fire someone for having a
disability.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the Web serve as an ultrafast method of conveying
information about the Clinton scandal, said Internet journalist
David Weir, it also offered users a chance to vent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is a place where people feel they can talk,''
said Weir, managing editor of the on-line magazine Salon. ``It's a
way for people to process their emotional response to big stories.
We saw that when Princess Diana died, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet also abounds with chances to bet on Clinton's
future, although White House advisers have said Clinton would never
resign because of the Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Judgement Day Betting Pool'' invites bets of $10 on which
day will be the president's last day in office and get a chance to
win up to $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Directions for the Internet pool, sponsored by a group called
the New Irish Sweepstakes, explained that, if Clinton ``gets off
scot-free'' and remains in office, his entire term, anyone who
picked the date Jan. 20, 2001, would win $27.
</P>
<P>
   If he left office earlier, winners would get more.
</P>
<P>
   Another Web pool _ Clinton's Last Day Contest _ costs nothing
and offers a plaque for the winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mr. Clinton stays till the normal end, all the names that
predicted (this) will be put in a dark blue beret and one name will
be chosen (to) get the plaque,'' the site's instructions say.
</P>
<P>
   One political newsgroup asked readers to pick one of 27
scenarios for how Clinton's term will end. These ranged from
impeachment, to Clinton suffering no repercussions whatsoever, to
bizarre possibilities like diversionary attacks on foreign nations.
</P>
<P>
   Choice No. 26 posed a scenario in which news anchor Katie Couric
interviews Chelsea Clinton on the ``Today Show,'' makes Chelsea cry
on camera and then the ``public sympathy saves Clinton.''

HACKER GROUP COMMANDEERS THE NEW YORK TIMES WEB SITE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By AMY HARMON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A group calling for the release of Kevin Mitnick, an
imprisoned computer criminal, commandeered The New York Times site
on the World Wide Web for several hours Sunday, forcing the
newspaper's electronic edition to shut down at a time when traffic
was particularly heavy because of the release on Friday of the
independent counsel's report over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of The Times' opening screen, some visitors to the site
at www.nytimes.com early Sunday saw a logo marked ``HFG'' with
images of nude women and a diatribe posted by the hackers that
included attacks on The Times' past coverage of Mitnick, who has
been in prison since he was arrested by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation in February 1995. Officials of New York Times
Electronic Media Co. shut down the site at 10:20 a.m. after the
break-in was discovered. They did not restore service until about
7:30 p.m., after taking steps to secure the site's computers.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Valiquette, an FBI spokesman, said the agency's computer
crime squad in New York had opened an investigation into the
break-in.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Nisenholtz, president of The Times' electronic media
division, said late Sunday that the company did not yet know how
the hacker organization, which called itself HFG _ or Hacking for
Girlies _ had breached its security. But he speculated that the
attack was timed to coincide with the increased traffic to the site
and to cyberspace generally in the wake of electronic publication
on Friday of the report to Congress by Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a much more destructive weekend to be doing this than
normal,'' Nisenholtz said. ``We were running 35 percent above
normal on Saturday, and typically Sunday is twice as big as
Saturday.'' A typical Sunday would see about 150,000 visitors to
the Times site.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the Times site appears to be the first time that
hackers have penetrated the Web site of a major news organization.
But computer security experts noted that attacks on high-profile
targets are by no means rare. Other targets have been sites
operated by the Pentagon; the Department of Justice; Coca-Cola; a
Fox TV affiliate in Chicago; Germany's Free Democratic Party; and
President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The incident seemed to underscore the fragility of the global
computer network during a period when governments, corporations and
individuals are increasingly relying on it as a source of instant
news and information. Several large Internet service providers
reported record traffic volume over the weekend as people logged on
to read the Starr report, which Congress published on the Web
before it was made available elsewhere.

University and director of the nonprofit Cyberspace Policy
Institute in Washington, said it was fortunate that the attack was
not more malevolent.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, ``the material posted by the hackers is offensive,
childish, threatening and chilling,'' Hoffman said. ``It's a good
example of why we have to bring accountability to the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The approaching trial in January of Mitnick, a convicted
computer criminal who has been imprisoned since he was arrested on
charges of parole violation and several federal felony counts in
early 1995, also appears to have galvanized some members of the
computer underground. The group that took over the Times site
directed some of its comments at John Markoff, a reporter for The
Times who covered Mitnick's arrest. Earlier this year, Yahoo, the
biggest Internet search engine site, was hacked by a group
proclaiming its support for Mitnick. And in July, the hacker
magazine 2600 led a small protest outside the New York offices of
Miramax Films, which is producing a movie based on the book
``Takedown'' (Hyperion, 1996) by Tsutomu Shimomura and Markoff that
details the pursuit and capture of Mitnick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the trial date comes closer, we're going to be seeing a
strengthened effort in hacking Web sites to get the Kevin Mitnick
name known,'' predicted John Vranesevich, founder of Antionline, a
Web site at www.antionline.com that tracks hacker activity. Members
of the group that claimed responsibility for attacking the Times
site have for several years been engaged in a war of words on the
Internet with Carolyn Meinel, an author who writes about the
computer underground.
</P>
<P>
   The counterfeit Web page posted on the Times Web site included
text that could be read only by examining the underlying computer
code, which revealed an attack on the writing of Ms. Meinel, author
of ``The Happy Hacker'' (American Eagle Publications, 1998). The
group took issue with her comparing computer break-ins to
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we find the time and effort to hack a few pages, labeling
us `terrorists' will only further annoy us and provoke us,'' the
group's text stated, ``since it is absurd to make such parallels
between two disparate groups. The real reason we put any blame on
Carolyn Meinel is because of her obtuse over-dramatizations of our
actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meinel said in an interview Sunday that last month a group
identifying itself as HFG attacked the computers of Rt66, an
Internet service provider in Albuquerque, N.M., on which she has an
account.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Schmitz, Rt66's co-founder, said the company was working
with the FBI and local law enforcement authorities to identify
those responsible for the attacks on his site, especially one in
which several customers' credit card numbers were stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meinel said that she had been the victim of another attack
by a group she suspects may be linked to HFG, based on online
interactions she has had with a person who seems to be involved
with both groups.
</P>
<P>
   In that attack, made on several Internet users simultaneously,
including Ms. Meinel and Markoff, the attackers subscribed the
victims to tens of thousands of Internet mailing lists in an effort
to disrupt their electronic mail service.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Meinel said she was writing a second book, to be titled
``The Hacker Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are desperate for fame,'' she said. ``These are
the kids who used to make stink bombs. Now they have the
Internet.''

JUDGE DELAYS, BUT WON'T DISMISS MICROSOFT ANTITRUST CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MICHAEL PAULSON   
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge Monday refused to dismiss the
antitrust case against Microsoft, but agreed to postpone the trial
for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson narrowed the case
somewhat, throwing out one element of the legal attack brought by
state and federal law enforcement officials against the software
giant. But Jackson, in a 54-page ruling, said that far too many
facts are in dispute for him to rule on the overall case without a
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, generally expected, was greeted with predictable
joy by government lawyers and unhappiness by Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very pleased with the court's decision, and look
forward to the upcoming trial,'' said Justice Department
spokeswoman Gina Talamona.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft spokesman Jim Cullinan said ``While we are
disappointed the court did not grant our entire motion, we are
pleased that the court narrowed the lawsuit somewhat by dismissing
one of the government's claims. ... We believe the facts and the
law are on our side, and look forward to presenting a powerful case
when we go to trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who had originally scheduled the trial to begin Sept.
8, had already agreed to postpone it until Sept. 23 and Monday
acquiesced to a request by lawyers from both sides to further
postpone the trial until Oct. 15. The delay was sought because
neither the government nor Microsoft has finished pre-trial
questioning of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   At the trial, the attorneys general of the United States, 20
states and the District of Columbia will attempt to prove that
Microsoft has violated national and state antitrust laws with
anti-competitive conduct. The government lawyers allege that
Microsoft has illegally attempted to maintain a monopoly on
computer operating systems and to extend that monopoly into the
market for Internet browsers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft denies any wrongdoing, and says the government has
mistaken aggressive competition for illegality.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday' ruling, Jackson threw out one claim brought by the
state attorneys general alleging that Microsoft unlawfully used its
operating system monopoly to obtain a competitive advantage in the
browser market. That allegation _ which is technically different
from the government's more serious charge that Microsoft has
attempted to monopolize the browser market _ is based on a
controversial legal theory called ``monopoly leveraging'' that
Jackson said has been discredited.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft sought some solace in Jackson's decision to dismiss
that element of the case, because the company believes it will be
harder for the government to prove that Microsoft attempted to
monopolize the browser market than it would have been to prove that
Microsoft merely attempted to gain a competitive advantage.
Microsoft believes that the government will be unable to prove it
attempted to monopolize the browser market because the Netscape
Communications Corp. maintains a majority share of that market.
</P>
<P>
   But the states minimized the importance of the dismissal of the
monopoly leveraging claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased with this,'' said a spokeswoman for New York
Attorney General Dennis Vacco.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also said it was pleased that Jackson appeared to
question one of the government's proposed remedies: that Microsoft
be forced to market a version of Windows 98 that does not include a
browser. The version of Windows 98 now on the market contains both
an operating system and Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser, and
the company contends that the two functions are inextricably
integrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Government lawyers) rely on the declaration of Edward W.
Felten, Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Princeton
University, for the proposition that Web browsing functionality can
be removed from Windows 98 without damaging the underlying
operating system,'' Jackson wrote. ``Whether Dr. Felten's
`mechanism' actually removes the `browser,' or merely removes code
that `look(s) more like a key to opening Internet Explorer than
anything that could plausibly be considered Internet Explorer
itself,' remains to be seen,'' he added, quoting a Microsoft legal
filing.

Look before you leap into getting new computer running 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only way I really learn is by screwing up. I ought to be a
genius by now.
</P>
<P>
   My latest lesson came when I bought my new computer two weeks
ago. I got it from one of those bargain basement outfits _ a
hole-in-the-wall office in a small shopping center. It had the best
price I could find _ $800 lower than what I would have paid for a
computer configured the same way from the brand-name companies.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you think this is going to be a tale of woe of how the
small company cheated me, sold me a beige-colored box full of
low-rent components. That's not true. The major components of the
computer were top quality and _ after about a week's worth of
tweaking on my part _ the PC works great.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a tale of woe. It's about what I learned by screwing
up.
</P>
<P>
   I learned that getting a new computer up and running correctly
can be an intimidating task for ordinary mortals. And I'm as
ordinary and as mortal as they come. Maybe some of my adventures
with the new PC will be of some help to you.
</P>
<P>
   My main mistake was in failing to plan. I got so excited by the
notion of a new computer that I didn't stop to think. For instance,
I knew I would need to transfer some files from my old computer.
But I didn't see that as any big deal. I don't own a Zip drive but
_ since I didn't need to move programs, just some documents from
Microsoft Word, stored e-mail, a few spreadsheet files and stuff _
I figured floppy disks would work fine.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson 1. I had a lot more data than I would have dreamed
possible. Some of it included electronic photo files from my
digital camera and image scanner. I should have used a Zip drive or
some other storage device bigger than a floppy disk. You've heard
of tennis elbow? I finished the week with floppy disk wrist from
all that disk swapping.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson 2. I wish I had stored my personal data in separate
easy-to-find folders. It was scattered all over the computer. Some
of that is unavoidable, but most of it could have been stored in
separate folders. Since my old computer got handed down to a
friend, I wanted to make sure all my personal files were gone. None
of the stuff is particularly interesting or sensitive (other than
some poetry so bad it's probably against the law in Georgia), but I
didn't want someone else reading it. So I spent hours tracking down
personal files in almost every folder on the PC.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson 3. I should have stored the installation CDs for the
programs I really need (Microsoft Office, Eudora Pro and other
staples of computing life) all in one place. You're probably not as
absent-minded as I am. And because of my job I end up with a lot of
software that I don't need. But I spent more time searching for
installation CDs than I did getting the computer set up.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson 4. I learned that things aren't always as easy as they
seem. Lots of times I'll get e-mail from a reader with a computer
problem and I'll think _ jeez, that's easy to fix. Last week
furnished a fresh taste of how complicated supposedly simple things
can be.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few low-rent components on my new computer was a
no-name modem card. I couldn't get the danged thing to work
correctly. I actually know a lot about modems. But I finally had to
call for help from my Internet provider's technical support staff.
After two hours, those folks couldn't solve the problem. Luckily I
had a spare external modem and did what any wise person would do _
gave up and installed the external.
</P>
<P>
   One of the certainties in life is the fact you'll replace that
computer of yours someday. Unless you want to become a genius like
I am, start planning now.

SURFING THE NET  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By L.R. SHANNON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trouble with traveling on the World Wide Web is that after a
while you may crave a home there, a place where you pick up your
mail, chat with friends, trade gossip and information or just hang
out.
</P>
<P>
   On the Web, you can wander from site to site, searching for
rooms and restaurants, booking air fares, seeking sights to see and
places to play. But it is like staying in a different hotel every
night of a vacation; eventually you forget where you are, and you
never talk to anyone. Consequently, a dozen or so Web sites have
gotten more homey lately.
</P>
<P>
   Until the early 1990s, the brave souls who sought information
and socialization on line joined such services as America On Line,
Compuserve, Prodigy, GEnie, Bix, eWorld and hundreds of others.
Only the bravest of the brave tried the Internet, a vast collection
of cybertext scattered around the world, accessed by arcane
commands and intended for the technologically sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these services still exist, but since the beginning of
the World Wide Web, a friendlier subsidiary of the Internet, many
people have gone straight to the Web, usually via a search engine,
a kind of index.
</P>
<P>
   HOME ON THE WEB
</P>
<P>
   Setting Up a Site
</P>
<P>
   www.yahoo.com
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo has long been my search engine of first choice, partly
because of its rich selection of sites _ there are 47 subcategories
in the travel section alone _ and partly, no doubt, from force of
habit. Now news headlines have been added, with links to a variety
of journalistic establishments, as well as stock quotes, free
e-mail, and a personal calendar to remind you of anniversaries,
birthdays and other important dates.
</P>
<P>
   You can set up your Yahoo page to suit yourself, with the kinds
of news, weather, scores and stock prices that you are interested
in. I set mine up to watch for Travel (with the key words New
England, inn and budget) and Air Fares (with the key words air
fares, airline fares, United States and North America).
</P>
<P>
   With those personalized changes, which took place immediately,
Yahoo would watch for news in those categories. There are ``rooms''
where you ``chat'' about travel, television, investments, sports,
science fiction, cyberdating and whatever _ all on bright, colorful
screens that are not so bright and colorful that they take forever
to download.
</P>
<P>
   CUSTOMIZING
</P>
<P>
   Browsing the World
</P>
<P>
   www.excite.com
</P>
<P>
   Excite tempts me. The opening page, spiffier than Yahoo's but
not excessively so, offers e-mail and chat rooms, top news events,
technology, business, sports news and scores, stock quotes, weather
(you enter your ZIP code or the ZIP code of a place you are
planning to visit) and even a horoscope.
</P>
<P>
   As with Yahoo, the content can be customized. Excite offers a
profusion of travel sites, in broader categories than Yahoo's:
reservations, destinations, busi-ness travel, cruises and tours,
family travel, frequent flier and adventure. There are car rental
sites, restaurant guides and a map on which you click to browse the
world. Nice.
</P>
<P>
   VIRTUAL HOUSE HUNTING
</P>
<P>
   I have dipped into many other portals, as Web homes are coming
to be called, and Yahoo and Excite struck me as the leading ones.
But a virtual home, like a real home, is a highly personal choice.
America On Line, www.aol.com; Compuserve, www.compuserve.com; and
the Microsoft Network, home.microsoft.com, have Web pages distinct
from, and not nearly as comprehensive as, their proprietary
extra-cost services, which are promoted on their Web sites; both
AOL and the Microsoft Network have travel categories you can click
on.
</P>
<P>
   Compuserve does not, and its site seems largely a promotion for
their main service. If you are virtual house hunting, you might
also check Altavista, www.altavista.digital.com; Geocities,
www.geocities.com; Infoseek, www.infoseek.com; Lycos,
www.lycos.com; Netcenter, home.netscape.com; Planet Direct,
www.planetdirect.com; and Snap, www. snap.com.
</P>
<P>
   (Thanks to the Sept. 1 issue of PC Magazine for the list.) It's
house-hunting time.

FREE-SPEECH ADVOCATE TO GET INTERNET RECORDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PAMELA MENDELS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This week, a Utah state group will begin handing over Internet
filtering records to a critic who successfully fought to have the
files declared public documents.
</P>
<P>
   The critic, Michael Sims, a computer programmer in New York
City, hopes to find out whether students and teachers are being
kept from seeing innocuous Web sites as well as sites that are
arguably inappropriate for children.
</P>
<P>
   Sims is a member of The Censorware Project, a volunteer group of
free speech advocates who are opposed to the use of software
filters by public institutions. He expects the records to reveal
which Internet destinations students and school employees were
prevented from reaching by SmartFilter, a software program used by
many Utah schools.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Secure Computing, the company that makes the
SmartFilter program, declined comment on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Sims chose Utah as a test case because, unlike many other
states, Utah offers most of its schools Internet access and related
services through one group, the Utah Education Network.
</P>
<P>
   When Sims first approached the Utah Education Network for the
records, agency officials told him that the information in the logs
was the property of the schools and, therefore, the agency could
not release it.
</P>
<P>
   Sims then approached the Utah State Records Committee. In late
June the committee voted to give Sims the records. The decision,
lawyers said, was the first time, they are aware, that a state body
has decided to release filtering logs to an individual after
declaring the electronic documents a public record.

INTEL AGREEMENT INDICATES RIFT WITH MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In an agreement to be announced Wednesday, Intel
Corp. will license its advanced video compression software to Real
Networks Inc., a Seattle-based developer of programs that deliver
audio and video over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the expectation that Intel's technology will improve the
performance of Real Network's software, the deal is seen as further
evidence of growing cracks in the so-called Wintel duopoly, the
cooperative relationship under which Intel's microprocessors and
Microsoft Corp.'s operating systems have long dictated the
direction of the personal computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the Real Networks deal, Intel is sharing its technology with
a Microsoft competitor in an area that is thought to be crucial to
the future commercialization of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Real Networks says that about 30 million people now use its
software. That is believed to give it a substantial lead over
Microsoft, which developed a competing technology, known as
Netshow, then later hedged its bets by paying tens of millions of
dollars for an equity stake in Real Networks.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Intel-Real Networks deal does not include an Intel
investment, both companies are calling it ``strategic.'' Intel will
license its compression technology for use in the newest version of
Real Networks' multimedia software, Realvideo GE, which is now in
testing.
</P>
<P>
   Real Networks' ``streaming'' software delivers audio or video in
a stream of bits as it is being heard or watched. That makes it
more like television or radio than were early multimedia
technologies that required a user to download an entire file from
an Internet site before it could be played.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's compression software squeezes a lot of data into a tiny
file so that it can be sent more quickly over the Internet,
resulting in fewer dropped sounds and smoother videos.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to improving the quality of videos, Intel's
compression technology will reduce the computing power required to
translate video images into a digital format.
</P>
<P>
   Intel executives said that while in the past multiple computers
had been needed to encode live video, the new technology would
create video files on a computer running Intel's top-of-the-line
450-megahertz Pentium II microprocessor. The videos can be played
back on standard personal computers at rates ranging from 5,000 to
a million bits a second, depending on the speed of the user's
Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can use this technology to scale up to full-screen
video,'' said Pat Gelsinger, Intel's vice president and general
manager of desktop products.
</P>
<P>
   Gelsinger also insisted that the agreement with a Microsoft
competitor was not a break with Intel's earlier strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is business as usual for us,'' he said. ``We've been
developing technology for years, and we've worked with industry
leaders. Our strategy is no way affected by these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The video compression technology was developed at Intel
Architecture Laboratories, the Oregon development site of several
earlier programs and other technologies that touched off quarrels
between Intel and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Intel has attempted to put forward a variety of
hardware and software technologies intended to add new features to
personal computer design. The company's strategy has been to create
market demand for more powerful computer hardware by persuading
computer users to adopt new functions.
</P>
<P>
   However, Microsoft has frequently opposed Intel initiatives that
it believe threatens its control over software design through the
Windows operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Glaser, Real Networks' chairman and founder and a former
Microsoft employee, said of Microsoft and Intel, ``The two
companies are becoming more independent as we move more toward a
consumer electronics world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Intel technology is referred to as a codec, a shortening of
the term compressor-decompressor. Such programs, which can be
created as either hardware circuits or software routines, compress
and then decompress digitized audio, video or images.

CLINTON'S RACE INITIATIVE PLAYS IN PIEDMONT 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM WONG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The breathless Lewinsky scandal has all but
eclipsed the sunlight needed by other national issues.
</P>
<P>
   Take President Clinton's race initiative. When he launched it
last year, he wanted to spark a national conversation about race
relations. All we seem to be getting now is a national conversation
over sexual relations. The year-long race project is about to end,
and even if the president wanted to shine a spotlight on it now,
what news media outlet would pay any attention?
</P>
<P>
   Forget about the national stage. Clinton's idea of getting
Americans to talk with one another about race relations was brought
to life last week in, of all places, Piedmont.
</P>
<P>
   Piedmont? The tiny, well-to-do California city of 11,000
residents that is completely surrounded by Oakland prefers
anonymity. It is one of least likely places to host an
award-winning documentary film about black-white relations, if only
because Piedmont's black population is minuscule.
</P>
<P>
   But one night last week, there it was _ a public gathering of
people of many different racial and ethnic backgrounds watching
Macky Alston's moving film, ``Family Name.'' The film is about
Alston's poignant search for linkages between white and black
families in North Carolina that share the same last name, and his
discovery that his white slave-owning family was related to former
slaves.
</P>
<P>
   The many themes of the film, which aired on PBS, sparked plenty
of conversations between the filmmaker and the audience, which, in
addition to racial diversity, had a wide generational range, from
young children to grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   The story of how Piedmont came to host the ``Family Name''
screening is itself illuminating. For most of its 92 years as a
city, Piedmont _ a little more than a square mile in area with only
3,500 households _ has been the home of executives, doctors and
lawyers. Its racial makeup was white, its political orientation
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, however, Piedmont has been changing. Now there
are slightly more registered Democrats than Republicans. Asian
Americans are close to 20 percent of the population, while African
Americans are only about 1 to 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As a way of easing the transition from Piedmont's past to its
present and future, some Piedmonters of different racial
backgrounds pushed the school district to form an Appreciating
Diversity Committee. This year, the committee is sponsoring a film
series to showcase films that could generate dialogue about all
sorts of differences _ race, disabilities, etc., according to
Paulina Sue, a committee member.
</P>
<P>
   In looking for appropriate films, Sue came across a flier for
P.O.V., the public television series run by American Documentary.
P.O.V. had just begun its own Television Race Initiative, which
isn't related organizationally to Clinton's race initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative offers films like ``Family Name'' to groups,
churches and the like to stimulate community conversations about
race relations. The night before the Piedmont screening, ``Family
Name'' was shown at San Francisco's Grace Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the Piedmont event expected 25 to 50 people. About
250 people showed up, far exceeding the Grace Cathedral crowd of
90.
</P>
<P>
   One heartwarming event does not a transformation make. But what
a besieged president envisioned a year ago is playing itself out
far from the humid shores of the Potomac. Life goes on.

THIS VW BEETLE'S A SORRY IMPOSTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROSINE REYNOLDS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ We stood at adjacent gas pumps and I asked how
she liked her Saturn. She said her car ``had some miles on it,''
but was holding up well.
</P>
<P>
   And then her eyes glazed over with a manic sheen and her whole
posture changed. ``What I'd really like,'' she whispered, ``is one
of those new Beetles. They're so cute!''
</P>
<P>
   Right then I knew we would never be friends.
</P>
<P>
   The new Beetle is a fraud, an upstart, a GI Joe in Barbie
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot deny the ... magic of its shape,'' Volkswagen
chairman Ferdinand Piech said recently. But shape was not the
reason for the original Volkswagen's success. It was the ``people's
car,'' and never forgot that. All its life, it atoned for its Third
Reich ancestry by serving the poor. That was VW's mission. Shape
was an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   This lesson was probably lost on Piech, a nephew of the late
Ferdinand Porsche, because he didn't hesitate to mess around with
both the old magic shape and the old interior.
</P>
<P>
   If the automaker had understood the car's need to serve, he
would have left the engine alone. The new engine, four cylinders
and water-cooled, is now mounted where the trunk should be, in the
front.
</P>
<P>
   Not one, but two big mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   When a driver is laboring over the tortuous Grapevine into Los
Angeles, for example, that driver does not want to depend on a
water-cooled engine. Such an engine will overheat, boil over, and
force its vehicle to camp there in the high desert until night and
the temperature fall. But the old VW could always get through. Its
driver could wave thumbs-up encouragement as it passed by, could
send the AAA truck back for those less fortunate. This bit of
help-each-other Americana has been forgotten, traded away for cute.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, when the fan belt broke in the original VW's
rear-mounted engine, creating a nimbus of rubbery black smoke, that
smoke was much better in the rear. There it could alert honking
motorists, rather than blow around in front, obscuring the driver's
vision. Further, a fuel line that bubbled like a Wurlitzer when it
overheated was simple and cheap to diagnose. It held off useless
estimates from mechanics who were eager to sell a complete engine
rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   The VW was the people's car in the best sense of the word: short
enough to wash the roof without using a ladder, cheap as a
lawnmower to fuel, easy to park. The engine, if it needed
attention, could be lifted out by a husky teen-ager and set on the
dining table for closer inspection. The headlight, if it burned
out, could be replaced with a new bulb, a Phillips screwdriver, and
an eyeball guess as to where the center beam should be.
</P>
<P>
   When the gas ran out, an auxiliary tank could be engaged by
kicking a crank in the back wall. The old car, the original Bug,
knew its place and tried to please. But then it mutated.
</P>
<P>
   The VW bus, Teutonic ancestor of the minivan, was deceptive and
vicious. A tippy, wind-resistant box, the bus could hold an entire
carpool, a small apartment-load of furniture, a rented Rototiller
and plants _ but it transported all this with the car's same
engine.
</P>
<P>
   Bus gears lost more teeth than the average first-grade class;
their valves blew like a pipe organ. Their highway mileage was
confined to flat roads or downhill grades, and their destination
time defined ``whenever.''
</P>
<P>
   And still Volkswagen kept experimenting _ Golfs and Jettas and
Cabriolets _ but those weren't Bugs. Neither is this parvenu that's
getting all the attention. Before the flower in its bud vase had
barely wilted, it was called back to the factory. Got a boo-boo in
its wiring system, poor baby. Had to have its widdle battery tray
sanded.
</P>
<P>
   I tell you, in the old days, we had more pride than that.
Neighbors helped neighbors, loaned each other parts, siphoned each
other's gas, reset each other's odometers. Our cars might not have
been beautiful, but they had a sense of community; they kept each
other going.

MINISTER SPEAKS FROM EXPERIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Mass. _ It is an extraordinary role _ to provide
spiritual counsel to President Clinton in his darkest moment.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps few other men or women of the pulpit are as
qualified to help Clinton make right with his family and the
country as the Reverend Gordon MacDonald, pastor of one of the most
successful Christian congregations in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday in an electrifying sermon that drew a standing
ovation from his congregation at Grace Chapel in Lexington,
MacDonald revealed that Clinton had asked him and two other
ministers to ``help him walk his way through a personal restoration
process.'' And, ``I have chosen to embrace this man, as a sinner in
need of mercy,'' MacDonald added.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three ministers Clinton sought out, MacDonald said he, in
particular, brings ``an understanding of what it is like to face
the public scrutiny when one has sinned. I have gone through _ and
continue to go through _ the breaking process.''
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald was alluding to his own journey from wrongdoing to
repentance to restoration 11 years ago when he publicly admitted
committing adultery.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald had left Grace Chapel in 1984 _ after propelling the
congregation into one of the most prominent Christian churches in
the nation _ for other leadership roles in the evangelical
Christian world.
</P>
<P>
   But after revelations of infidelity left him without a job and
in a virtual spiritual wilderness, it was the leaders at Grace
Chapel who helped him return to the Christian fold.
</P>
<P>
   Now MacDonald will guide Clinton, whose life has been deeply
influenced by his Southern Christian heritage, on his own journey
of penitence and transformation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am in a position to talk the language of repentance and what
it takes to find a deeper and more purposeful walk with God in the
midst of a personal tragedy,'' MacDonald said in his lengthy
sermon, which was posted on Grace Chapel's Internet site. ``For the
foreseeable future I will be visiting with the president on a
fairly regular basis, by phone and by personal encounter.''
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald, who has provided spritual advice to Clinton on
overnight visits to the White House for several years, has
repeatedly refused to discuss details of his conversations with the
president. ``I have refused to talk to the press on the basis that
my connection to the president is far too private to disclose,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald found his own way back to redemption through the
support of three spiritual advisers who were chosen by the elders
at Grace Chapel. Among evangelical Christians, such counseling,
widely known as ``accountability circles,'' is commonly used to
pray and support people in crisis, usually Christian men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important for all of us to be in accountability
groups because if we don't have someone to talk to and someone to
support us in our walk with Jesus, we can wander off,'' said Joan
Carmody, a Grace Chapel member from Acton, who added that she was
``very proud'' of MacDonald's new role.
</P>
<P>
   Macdonald was asked to return as senior minister at Grace Chapel
four years ago. That decision stirred some controversy and caused a
small number of members to leave the sprawling suburban church.
</P>
<P>
   But congregants, clergy and others who know MacDonald say his
willingness to face his crucible and emerge a stronger and more
faithful Christian has earned him widespread admiration. Today he
leads a church of 2,300 members, which regularly attracts 4,000
people to weekend worship services.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald recounted his tumultuous experience in a book,
``Rebuilding Your Broken World,'' which Clinton told him in a Labor
Day phone call he had read a second time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having had some extensive experience in the subject of what we
biblical people call brokenness, I could sense his own brokenness
after the first few minutes of the conversation,'' MacDonald
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He made clear that he will try and help the president achieve
spiritual redemption. Clinton's political fate is in the hands of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a people who believe that no person sinks so low and
strays so far that they are not worth welcoming home when they come
to their senses,'' MacDonald said. ``This is the core message of
our Bible _ it speaks both to presidents and to paupers _ and all
of us who lie somewhere in between.''

JUDGED BY THEIR PEERS: A NYC YOUTH TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 15-year-old girl with short-cropped hair and a face
younger than her years gulped as she stepped into the room where
her fate would be decided. Two weeks earlier, she had been arrested
for trying to smuggle some marijuana to her boyfriend, an inmate at
Riker's Island, and now she was about to stand trial for her crime.
</P>
<P>
   But the court was not really a court. It was a room in a house
in one of the most desolate neighborhoods of the Bronx. The judge,
jurors, and lawyers were not quite authentic either. They were all
teenagers, just like her.
</P>
<P>
   The girl was walking into the 15th session of Youth Court, which
has been holding these tribunals since April. The court is a branch
of a private community-action group called Youth Force, funded
partly by a grant from the city but run by young people who have
been through the criminal court system themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the girl's case, like all the cases here, was very real.
It had been referred here by a probation officer and the Bronx
Family Court. And the sentence meted out by this jury would be no
less binding than the punishment handed down by a black-robed
grownup.
</P>
<P>
   Lillian Cordero, the Bronx probation officer who refers the
cases here, noted that all the defendants in Youth Court are first
offenders. ``The first arrest _ this is where we can still get to
them and turn them around,'' she said. ``If they've been through
the system many times, it's often too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Youth Court was the brainchild of Kim McGillicuddy and Ramesh
James. McGillicuddy, 34, the director of Youth Force, grew up in
Los Angeles and was arrested several times for shoplifting. After
turning herself around and going to UCLA, she took a youth-services
internship in the South Bronx, where she has lived since.
</P>
<P>
   James, 23, the assistant director, committed manslaughter at age
15. He served time at the Spofford Juvenile Detention Center in the
South Bronx, where McGillicuddy was working.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd got mixed up with the wrong people at the wrong time,''
James recalled. ``At Spofford, I figured as long as I'm locked up,
I might as well do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by McGillicuddy's leadership-training programs, James
organized his fellow inmates and peacefully lobbied the center's
administration to improve its school and library, set up
poetry-slam tournaments, expand the denominations of religious
services, and allow more frequent outside visits. After James got
out, he went to work for McGillicuddy at Youth Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``One out of four kids in our neighborhood goes to prison _ one
out of 10 goes to college,'' McGillicuddy said. ``We just felt we
could no longer walk down our streets without having another option
for these kids.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes before Youth Court case number 15 got under way,
the defense lawyer, Monique Asare, 18, was sitting at the table,
preparing. Asare is among the 1-in-10 from her neighborhood going
to college this fall. ``I'm studying maybe to be a social worker _
I know that system too well,'' she said. ``Or a child psychologist
_ they deal with mad kids, and I know what that's about.''
</P>
<P>
   She leaned over and whispered, ``I haven't lost a case yet. I'm
the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Not losing a case in this court doesn't mean getting the
defendant off. ``It means,'' she explained, ``when I represent you,
the sentence that I advise gets carried out.''
</P>
<P>
   The 15-year-old girl (whose name outside observers agreed to
keep confidential) took her seat. After 10 minutes or so of
questioning, Asare made her closing statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pretty cut and dried,'' she began. ``She admits doing
it. She said she smokes and she wants to quit. That's a good step
in the right direction. She didn't have to tell us that. I
recommend the following sentence _ two sessions as a juror in Youth
Court, a program on addictive substances, a legal-education
workshop, peer-pressure workshop, a relationship workshop.''
</P>
<P>
   The three jurors went upstairs to an office where the most
prominent display is a poster of Malcolm X.
</P>
<P>
   Damon Hutchinson, 15, who lives in the Crown Heights section of
Brooklyn _ a 90-minute subway ride away _ and has been working for
Youth Force since he was 10, was the first juror to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take off the peer-pressure workshop,'' he said. ``She decided
to smoke. She decided to take in the weed. This wasn't peers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I disagree with you,'' Kadamani jumped in. ``There's a lot of
peer pressure here. I know a lot of cases where people bring weed
in to their boyfriends because they're scared to say no, they're
scared the boyfriend might leave them after he gets out of jail.''
</P>
<P>
   After 10 minutes, the jury came back down to pronounce the
sentence Asare suggested. James then took the girl and her aunt,
who had come with her that day, upstairs to discuss the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very comfortable,'' the accused said. ``I like it that
everybody here is my age.'' She told James she wants to become a
member of Youth Force. He gave her a schedule of their staff
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Cordero, the probation officer, seemed pleased with the outcome.
In only one of Youth Court's previous 14 cases has the accused not
complied with the sentence _ and, as a result, was sent back into
the juvenile court system. The evader had been arrested for selling
heroin _ though two other teenagers, tried in Youth Court for the
same crime, obeyed their sentence and have since been doing fine.
</P>
<P>
   New York may be a law-and-order city these days, but Janet
Mehnert, who administers the Youth Court grant at City Hall,
insists the program, despite its soft edge, has sparked no
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The juvenile court system is so crowded,'' Mehnert said. ``And
the kids who go through Youth Court are getting legal education.
... They're getting involved in something positive instead of ...
winding up in detention.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the 15-year-old girl who tried to sneak dope into Riker's
Island, Ramesh James reported, a week after her trial, that she has
been coming to work on various projects at Youth Force nearly every
day since.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's going to be interviewed for a paid staff job next
week,'' James said. ``This sort of thing happens a fair amount.
That's what this organization does _ it links young people up to
something.''

THIS ELECTION, A REGULAR JOE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN McNAMARA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ No television cameramen jostled for the best angle when
he arrived. No burst of flashbulbs blinded him when he left. Joseph
P. Kennedy II came and went from his neighborhood polling place in
the city's Brighton section Tuesday without any of the fanfare that
has followed him all the days of his very public life.
</P>
<P>
   This election day belonged to the 10 Democrats who have spent
months of effort and millions of dollars in a quest for the most
storied seat in the US House of Representatives. The winner of the
Democratic primary is all but assured victory in November in a
district that has not sent a Republican to Congress in more than 50
years.
</P>
<P>
   For the man who still represents the 8th Congressional District
on Capitol Hill, the blessed absence of media at the Faneuil branch
of the Boston Public Library was something of a dress rehearsal for
his upcoming role as Joe Kennedy, private citizen.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect hardly fills him with dread. A year ago, he could
not step outside his Bigelow Street home, could not emerge from his
Rayburn House office without encountering hordes of reporters less
interested in his policy positions than in his brother's sexual
history.
</P>
<P>
   The frenzied news coverage of Michael Kennedy's relationship
with a teenage baby sitter might seem tame now next to revelations
about Bill Clinton's sexual encounters with a not-much-older White
House intern. But it was the noise and the distraction generated by
that scandal that persuaded the six-term congressman to abandon his
campaign for the Democratic nomination for governor of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have been running for governor today,'' Dottie
Clinton, Kennedy's appointment secretary, said wistfully Tuesday.
``You can't help feeling a little sad today.''
</P>
<P>
   Dottie Clinton has been with Joe from the beginning, running a
precinct, then a ward, then the whole city of Cambridge for him in
his first congressional bid in 1986. The district, long considered
one of the most liberal in the nation, is too often defined by the
progressives of Harvard Square, Beacon Hill, and the Back Bay. In
truth, the 8th is a more moderate place than the pundits would have
it. The votes and the effort of working people from Cambridge and
Waltham, Roxbury and Watertown sent James Michael Curley, Jack
Kennedy, Tip O'Neill, and Joe Kennedy to Washington to speak for
them on education and health care and the need for financial
security in their old age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twelve years is a long time,'' said Dottie Clinton, a little
at loose ends as she and her colleagues in Kennedy's Charlestown
office headed out to lunch instead of campaign headquarters. ``It's
hard to believe it's really been that long ago.''
</P>
<P>
   So much has changed in the dozen years since Joe Kennedy scored
a late endorsement from retiring House Speaker Thomas P. ``Tip''
O'Neill and swept over George Bachrach to claim the seat once held
by his uncle, John F. Kennedy. That race was then the most
expensive House race on record, with 14 candidates running up $3.2
million in campaign expenses. This year, venture capitalist Chris
Gabrieli alone spent almost $1 million more than that to finance
his own losing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A lot more than the cost of campaigning has changed in 12 years.
The hail of confetti that rained down on Kennedy in the
Independence Ballroom of the Sheraton Boston on primary night fell
on a simpler time in American politics.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Kennedy leaves office at a time of national soul searching
about the nature of leadership and the limits of privacy, questions
he saw previewed a year ago in those uncomfortable questions about
when and what he knew about his brother's relationship with the
baby sitter.
</P>
<P>
   There could be worse times for Joe Kennedy to leave the national
stage. There will be more autumn Saturdays to watch his sons,
cocaptains of their high school team, play football. More time to
refocus the work of Citizens Energy Corp. Fewer dashes for Logan
Airport. Fewer conflicts between his public and private selves.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two years ago, Joe Kennedy spent primary election day
running Senator Ted Kennedy's reelection campaign. Tuesday, he
spent primary election day listening to testimony on international
monetary policy in the House Banking Committee. Everyone knew that
his work on his uncle's campaign that year was his first political
job. No one really believes that his work on the House Banking
Committee will be his last.

MASSACHUSETTS SET BETTER FOR RECESSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Daniel Morgan looks down his client list, he
sees deals that should have closed by now. One customer said he was
going to buy Morgan's steel mill equipment last May, then in June,
then in July. Now the deal might be signed in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like a trend,'' said Morgan, senior vice president at
Morgan Construction Co. in Worcester, Mass. ``A lot of potential
customers are still serious about going forward, but they are
pushing off decisions about spending millions of dollars until they
see what impact the economy will have on them.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of wariness is spreading through the economy, as the
Asian financial crisis and a gyrating stock market increase fears
that the seven-year economic expansion may finally collapse _ as
all booms &UR;  &LR; eventually do _ into recession. &UR;  &LR; Some businesses report
that their customers are slowing or delaying spending plans on
fears the stock market will fall further than analysts anticipate
or the Asian crisis will spread beyond Russia to infect Latin
America and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; To be sure, few analysts predict the economy will soon slip
from growth into contraction. Most forecast expansion, though at a
slow rate, through 1999. But how would the Boston area fare if the
slowdown is harsher than expected or even deepens into recession,
defined as at least two consecutive quarters in which the economy
shrinks?
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Overall, economists say, the region's shift away from
manufacturing and defense, and into high-tech services, suggests
that it would do far better this time than in the last downturn,
which lasted from 1989 to 1991. In those 36 months, the state lost
11 percent of its jobs, its worst recession on record and one of
the deepest suffered by any state in the post-war period.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Boston economy is much less vulnerable today than in the
last recession. Any downturn would probably be shorter-lived and
less significant,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Regional
Financial Associates of West Chester, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   But the economists also offer a significant caveat: The
next &UR;  &LR; downturn might be accompanied by a slump in the stock market.
That would likely hurt a crucial sector of the local economy: the
burgeoning money-management industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sort of in uncharted territory in financial services,''
said Paul Harrington of the Center for Labor Market Studies at
Northeastern University. ``We don't know how it will behave and
what the losses would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Most economists say the torrid growth of recent years is bound
to slow in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   The Lexington firm Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI, for example, predicts
that total goods and services produced in &UR;  &LR; Greater Boston will rise
1.7 percent in value next year, down from 4.1 percent growth in
1997. Payrolls will rise 0.9 percent next year, the firm predicts,
down from 2.9 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea, Singapore, and other economically wounded nations
are buying fewer products from Massachusetts, the Alliance for the
Commonwealth reports, but sales to Europe have so far made up the
gap. A jittery stock market has money-management firms wary of new
hiring, but no one is talking about layoffs, either.
</P>
<P>
   What happens if the wariness is well-founded, and a recession
arrives? Economists say there are several reasons why it would be
less bleak than the last recession.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago:
</P>
<P>
   _The federal government was slicing defense spending, which hit
New England hard. The region is less reliant on defense today.
</P>
<P>
   _Boston was squeezed as businesses rejected its locally produced
minicomputers for personal computers made elsewhere. That kind of
sea change in technology is unlikely to strike again in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
   _Colleges were hit by a decline in the number of college-age
students. Today, however, the number of college-age people is
growing.
</P>
<P>
   _The real estate and banking sectors were heading into crisis.
Remember the condo glut? While real estate prices are rising
quickly today, analysts do not see the same kind of speculative
over-building that led to a collapse in housing and commercial real
estate markets last time around. That suggests banks are also less
likely to be saddled with the bad real estate loans that weakened
the financial sector in the last recession.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the local economy has changed in ways that
make some sectors more vulnerable to a severe slowdown or
recession. Here is how economists size up the prospects for some of
the region's most important industries.
</P>
<P>
   The money management industry, which includes Boston's mutual
fund companies, has grown dramatically, accounting for twice as
many jobs as before. These jobs are still relatively few in number
_ about 42,000, or 1.4 percent of all Greater Boston jobs. But they
pay well, and the region would suffer from layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, Boston is a wealthy region, and a stock
market downturn could prompt people to close their checkbooks. In
turn, that would hurt homebuilders, auto dealers, and other
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Economist Zandi said Massachusetts can boast of the highest
stock ownership in the country, about $25,000 per household
compared with $10,000 nationally. That makes it ``the most
sensitive of any of the 50 states to a (stock) sell-off,'' said
Frederick Breimyer, chief economist at State Street Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Like canaries in the coal mine, construction workers are among
the first to feel the effects of a downturn as businesses cancel
their construction plans and the housing market softens.
</P>
<P>
   Construction employment fell by half in the last recession.
``But that's not in the cards this time around, because we haven't
had a huge boom in construction employment,'' Harrington said. Just
over 100,000 people &UR;  &LR; work in construction today &UR;  &LR; in Massachusetts,
compared with 142,000 in 1988. &UR;  &LR; Moreover, projects like the Big Dig
rely on government funding, which is likely to continue even if the
private sector cuts spending.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs in manufacturing are also quick to disappear in a
recession, as companies buy fewer durable goods such as computers.
</P>
<P>
   But the state's manufacturing sector is less vulnerable. To
begin with, manufacturing is a smaller part of the economy, falling
to 14 percent of payrolls in the Greater Boston area from 28
percent in 1984, according to Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI. And much of
the manufacturing that remains is in sophisticated plants, such as
Polaroid's camera factories or Gillette's razor factory in South
Boston. Those jobs could be more durable than the type of textile
and furniture jobs that the state shed long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The manufacturing we have left is much more high-end,'' said
Northeastern's Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   Economists say the important health care sector is likely to
survive a recession well. Health care actually added jobs during
the last recession. Its success depends to a large degree on
federal spending for Medicare and other programs, which send money
to local hospitals. While there is always talk of cutbacks, some
people believe deep cuts are unlikely at a time when the
government, by some measures, is running a surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges and universities are commonly seen as recession-proof
businesses. In fact, they sometimes gain students as people lose
their jobs and return to school to upgrade their skills.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, private schools may find themselves losing
students to public universities, where tuition is often lower. And
adult education programs may lose students as employers cut back on
tuition-sharing programs.
</P>
<P>
   Two demographic trends bode well for local colleges and
universities. The number of college-age people is rising, and the
widening income gap between workers with college degrees and those
without has encouraged more people of all ages to go to college.
Two-thirds of college-age people are enrolled in post-secondary
programs, up from 49 percent in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Technology accounts for 8.3 percent of jobs in Greater Boston,
about the same as during the last recession, and those positions
could be vulnerable in a downturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``When basics like food become a major concern, you don't have
the spending power to buy high-tech products,'' said Breimyer of
State Street Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But others note that the local mix of jobs has changed. With the
minicomputer makers all but gone, the number of people building
high-tech hardware has dropped by one-third in the past decade. The
number of people writing software, creating Internet products, or
consulting with companies that want to use technology better has
grown by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some people believe that these new service jobs are more
durable. For example, John Keane Sr., chairman of Boston-based
Keane Inc., sees little let-up in the demand for software and
information-technology consulting services that will boost his
company's sales by 60 percent this year, to over $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Information technology is recognized as a competitive
tool,'' he said. ``If even one of your competitors is using it, you
have to use it.''

PAULA WOLFERT: MISTRESS OF THE MEDITERRANEAN 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHERYL JULIAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Paula Wolfert demands that you leap into her
passion. She is standing in the kitchen of Casablanca, where chef
Ana Sortun and guest chef Joe Simone of Hingham's Tosca are cooking
from Wolfert's new book and _ at this moment _ memorizing
everything she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taste this,'' she commands a visitor, holding up a cup of
seedless Turkish red-pepper flakes called Maras with a color so
startling they look fearsome _ not fire-engine red or candy-apple
red but a red that embodies burnt sienna, vermilion, port, pumpkin,
umber, dark ocher, crimson, carmine, and plum.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the taste. ``Notice,'' she says. ``No seeds.''
The tiny scarlet dots hit the tongue in layers _ not fiery layers
but smooth ripples, smoky and pleasingly warm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this not the elixir of the '90s?'' Wolfert asks.
</P>
<P>
   Well, if Wolfert says so, it shall be. At least if the pepper
flakes follow the route of preserved lemons and couscous, which she
found in Morocco 40 years ago; foie gras, the crowning glory of her
intense research into southwestern French cuisine in the early
1980s; and pomegranate molasses, the sweet-sour syrup she stumbled
upon in wanderings along the eastern Mediterranean. All of these
ingredients, now on restaurant menus across the country, were swept
up by her passion _ and her influence. Professional cooks listen to
Wolfert. They cook from her books and they eagerly learn from her.
The San Francisco resident willingly teaches everything she knows.
</P>
<P>
   Her sixth book, ``Mediterranean Grains and Greens''
(HarperCollins), offers more ingredients that you never heard of,
grains that have been around since the beginning of civilization,
and greens similar to the ones the earliest gatherers collected,
sorted, and boiled down until vast basketfuls were reduced to small
bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how they say that the oldest profession is motherhood
and the second oldest is whoring? That's ridiculous,'' she says.
``The oldest is gathering.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfert loves ethnobotany, the plant lore of a particular
culture. Information about ancient history and historical
geography, religion and anthropology pours forth when she talks
about food.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the subtleties of a culture, some hard to
comprehend at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put water in your bulgur, and no man will marry you,'' a
cook in Turkey told Wolfert. Good cooks, she learned, moisten the
bulgur with the juices of the flavorings they add _ such as chopped
young greens, onions, tomato paste, and red pepper paste _ then
knead them into the grain. Pummel is more like it, really,
according to a slide shown as part of Wolfert's lecture at Boston
University's Seminars in the Culinary Arts, the day after dinner at
Casablanca.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grains and greens are canvases,'' she says. ``People still eat
this way, even though they're moving to the cities. Cottage
industries are bringing the ingredients to the markets.''
</P>
<P>
   The cultures for whom grains and greens are essential components
of the diet live in the remotest regions, where the food uses
seasonings _ Maras pepper flakes, for instance _ largely unknown on
Western tables. Wolfert is famous for long treks into the
countryside to visit a cook. She travels with a translator and a
driver (she doesn't have a license), and always leaves with a
recipe whose edges seem parched by the ancient sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone should document how it's made, right?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfert took on the job of recording food that might be
forgotten, dishes that might start with a shepherdess in Tunisia
who collects khobbeiza (mallow leaves with the same mucilaginous
quality as okra), brings them home, and pounds them with oil, the
hot-pepper paste harissa, and coriander, until the greens are
creamy.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Wolfert found nettles, purslane, salsify greens,
lamb's-quarters, wild mustard, bergamot, garland chrysanthemum,
borage leaves, and shepherd's purse. She watched cooks work wonders
with stale bread and rice, chickpeas, semolina, and green wheat.
</P>
<P>
   The world spins more slowly where she travels, and Wolfert, 60,
softens her pace in those corners. She is mellow from many years
with these ordinary women, no longer prickly. And she is more
understanding when chefs take her recipes and multiply them to feed
a restaurant full of customers _ and don't succeed.
</P>
<P>
   She brings food she has learned about in unusual dialects and
diverse languages, from cooks who unravel their kitchen lives to
her. ``I kiss each woman on both cheeks and I touch my heart. It's
the way women are with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfert describes them in the countryside where they spend their
days, scarves tied tightly under their chins to keep the dust away,
pocketed aprons secured around their broad middles, as they collect
``apron greens.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The farther east you go in the Mediterranean,'' she says,
``the better the hospitality.''

BC GETTING FAMILIAR WITH WINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A year ago, there were so many unknowns about the
Boston College coaching staff. How would they work together? Would
the chemistry be right with the players? How would the team
respond?
</P>
<P>
   ``All of those things made a difference,'' said head coach Tom
O'Brien. ``We didn't really know the players and they didn't know
us. And it showed.''
</P>
<P>
   From the players' standpoint, there was uncertainty. Why should
a team that had three head coaches in five seasons, plus a spate of
new coordinators and assistants, believe anything that O'Brien and
his staff were preaching each day?
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been through so many coaches, with so many changes, the
first reaction was to be cynical of these guys,'' said guard Doug
Brzezinski. ``But then, after talking to Coach O'Brien, I knew it
wasn't bull. He didn't tell us we would stink or that we would be
great. He just told us that if we worked hard, we would have a
chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Two games into O'Brien's second season, the Eagles are doing
just that, knocking off Georgia Tech and Rutgers to put a new spin
on the season outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, 4-0 is not a fantasy, since the next two opponents,
Temple and Louisville, are a combined 0-4. But as the Eagles began
serious preparations for Temple Tuesday afternoon, there were no
signs of overconfidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 2-0,'' said O'Brien, ``which is better than the
alternative. But we haven't really proven anything yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even to themselves, although that has changed slowly over
the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a year to get settled in has meant all the difference
in the world,'' said O'Brien. ``It's so many things, from just
knowing the players to them knowing us and knowing what to expect
from us.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien believes you practice the way you play, and he believes
in hard practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember a year ago,'' he said, ``on the week before the
Temple game, having players on the floor totally exhausted, telling
us it was the hardest practice they had ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   It took most of the season for the Eagles to get into the flow
O'Brien wanted. They lost five straight games, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had that stretch in the middle of the season,'' said
O'Brien. ``I just went and told them, `Let's regroup and go out and
win the month of November.'''
</P>
<P>
   Which they did, knocking off Pittsburgh and Army and narrowly
losing to Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys started to finally learn how important practice
was,'' said Brzezinski. ``And they learned to play their hardest
all the time. This year has been so different because we all
believe in what the coaches tell us.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien knows that the water will get choppy, even if the Eagles
beat Temple and Louisville. Beginning Oct. 8, they face Virginia
Tech, Syracuse, Navy, Miami, and Notre Dame _ a stretch that will
determine whether this season ends with a bowl trip.
</P>
<P>
   His formula for success is simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Practice,'' he said. ``It just makes sense. If you make
mistakes in practice, chances are you're going to make them in the
game. If you don't work on something, the chances of you doing it
correctly in a game are not as great.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like playing golf. If you never practice hitting out of
the trap with your sand wedge, the chances of you making a good
shot during a round aren't nearly as good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this team knows that now. Everyone is more comfortable
with each other.''

NEGRO LEAGUE STAR JOSH GIBSON'S HALL OF FAME PLAQUE. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa have passed Roger Maris,
they can chase Josh Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   This is half-serious since no one knows how many home runs
Gibson hit during his thunderous campaigns in the Negro leagues in
the 1930s and 40s. One year he was given credit for 69. Another
year, it was 75. Some accounts give him 84 in a 170-game season in
1936.
</P>
<P>
   The absolute facts will always be hidden, since black baseball
was played in a segregated America where white daily newspapers
paid no attention and black weeklies could not keep full track of
teams that barnstormed far from their cities. Estimates of the home
runs Gibson hit in his 17-year career range from the ``almost 800''
on his plaque in the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., to
as many as 962.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson was called the black Babe Ruth. Some scoffed at even
that. Negro League great Judy Johnson once said, ``If Josh Gibson
had been in the big leagues in his prime, Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron
would still be chasing him for the home run record.''
</P>
<P>
   As this is not the sports pages, this is not a serious
comparison of McGwire and Sosa to Gibson. Baseball folks can argue
over the grave issues of competition, pitching quality, ballpark
sizes, differences in travel, and today's availability of pills to
boost testosterone and build muscles. But no historic home run
chase should go without at least some mention of Gibson and his
contributions to baseball's storied past.
</P>
<P>
   Most baseball fans know about Ruth and how he pointed to a spot
where he would hit a home run. Gibson's power caused sportswriters
to claim he knocked the ball even farther than Ruth in the House
that Ruth Built.
</P>
<P>
   In a game in Yankee Stadium, Gibson hit a drive that was
remembered decades later by a reporter as ``a rifle shot that
rattled off the escarpments in front of the 161st Street Elevated
Railway (which) would probably have traveled 700 feet had it been
two feet higher. It was a 680-foot explosion!''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Ribowsky, author of ``The Power and the Darkness,'' a 1996
book on the life of Gibson, wrote that there is no evidence that
Gibson hit the ball that far. But Gibson hit many 450-500-foot home
runs, with some of his most mammoth blasts indeed registered in
major league ballparks rented by black teams.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Tinker, Gibson's first manager, said Gibson ``was built
like sheet metal. If you ran into him, it was like you ran into a
wall. He was like a ramrod. He didn't move a muscle 'til the ball
was almost in on him. That's why you couldn't fool him with a
curveball, and you couldn't get a fastball by him. He was like a
reflex, a nerve jumpin' all at once. I'm tellin' you, the Lord made
that boy to hit a baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Buck Leonard, another Negro League great, said that when his
team played against Gibson, it feared him so much, ``we woulda put
the center fielder in the bleachers if we could've. He wasn't only
a great hitter. He was a damn smart hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, Gibson hit a home run so far out onto some railroad tracks
in Monessen, Pa., that the mayor ordered that the blast be
tape-measured. The mayor said the homer traveled 512 feet. In
winter league games in Puerto Rico, Gibson was said to hit so many
home runs into the palm trees beyond the fences, fans hung placards
on the trees to mark the bulls-eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard said he saw Gibson hit a ball out of New York's Polo
Grounds. Minutes later he said, a man came into the stadium asking,
`Who the hell hit the ball over here on the train track?''' Gibson
hit a home run in York, Pa., that Negro League star Cool Papa Bell
swore cleared the fence and landed on a passing truck on the
Pennsylvania Turnpike. The still-traveling ball became as the
legend goes, the first 500-mile home run.
</P>
<P>
   White players and managers saw enough of Gibson's power in their
few exhibition games against black all-stars to pay him his due.
Honus Wagner said Gibson was ``one of the best natural hitters I've
ever seen.'' Leo Durocher said, ``everything they said about him
was true, and then some. He hit one of the longest balls I've ever
seen. He caught hold of one of Weaver's fast ones, and I'll bet you
it's still sailing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1972, died in 1947 at
the age of 34, the year Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier. As
powerful as Gibson was on the field, he was bludgeoned by life,
demoralized by the loss of his wife, who died giving birth and
dogged by drinks and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Our past will forever deny Gibson a place alongside McGwire and
Sosa or Aaron and Ruth. But his existence was important. Satchel
Paige, the greatest pitcher of the Negro Leagues, said Gibson
``could hit home runs around Babe Ruth's home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gibson never got to compete against Ruth, his home runs
helped convince white owners they could no longer deny black
talent. With every blast, Gibson helped to create an America where
a black Hank Aaron could overtake the white Ruth in the record
books and Sosa, a black man, can hug McGwire, a white man, on the
same field in pursuit of the same home run record.

   TAKE-BOS  
 CAMBRIDGE, Mass.: ... the hospitality.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wolfert's stories begin like this: ``We flew from Istanbul to
Kars, near the Armenian border. Then we drove to Trabzon on the
Black Sea coast of Turkey. We had a Kurdish driver, of course. It
was Ramadan and no one had eaten all day.''
</P>
<P>
   During her visit here, someone wants to know if she has ever had
to sleep in a tent in some faraway place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that plural?'' she countered. ``I've slept in many, many
tents. I've also slept high up so the scorpions wouldn't get me.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Wobbles like your belly'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Paula Wolfert stumbled into the world of food. She was a young
bride when she went with her husband at the time to live in Morocco
in 1959. ``Couscous and Other Good Food From Morocco'' was born
there. It took many more years, the end of the first marriage, and
the beginning of a romance with crime novelist Bill Bayer to
finally produce the couscous book in 1973. It is still the
definitive work on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   She has eaten so much ill-prepared couscous that ``Grains and
Greens'' covers the territory again. By the time she finishes her
lecture at BU, she has most of the students convinced that they'll
never simply follow the package directions on instant couscous.
They'll steam it, aerate it, steam it again. ``It multiplies 18
times,'' she says. ``You lift the couscous. This is the most
sensual thing. Play with it.'' She shows slides to demonstrate.
``This is air,'' she says. ``It wobbles like your belly.''
</P>
<P>
   Instructions for couscous from scratch appear in ``Grains and
Greens.'' You begin with coarse semolina and add fine semolina,
cold water, sea salt, and olive oil. You have to press it through a
strainer, then a fine sieve, and steam it three times. But you
don't have to do it sitting on the floor the way they do in North
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   As Wolfert says, someone's got to record this, right?
</P>
<P>
   When she spent a brief interlude in southwestern France, she
made confit and foie gras sound so irresistible, they showed up on
menus as soon as ``The Cooking of South-West France'' was
published. As a result of the book, Ariane Daguin, the daughter of
French chef Andre Daguin, set up the foie gras business D'Artagnan,
which is flourishing today. Her father sold his two-star restaurant
in Auch last year. American foodies already had made a pilgrimage
there. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Mediterranean course &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mediterrean cooking has taken a different course. It spans
restaurants in so many demographics that it appears on the tables
of celebrity chefs and at fast food-places along the highway.
Wolfert never set out to research food that would become
commonplace. Her cooking is too involved, and many ingredients
aren't available here, although she gives extensive mail-order
lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The larder's better on the East Coast than the West Coast,''
she declares. She has found the Maras peppers in Formaggio Kitchen
in Cambridge, and she likes the Middle Eastern markets along
Belmont and Mt. Auburn streets in Watertown.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfert and Bayer, who have been married 15 years, moved to San
Francisco several years ago. At the time, she told a reporter that
she went ``kicking and screaming.'' She had already moved with
Bayer from Manhattan to Connecticut; the couple summered at his
house in West Tisbury. They sold both homes.
</P>
<P>
   Bayer had a ``midlist crisis'' and changed his nom de plume to
David Hunt. His ``The Magician's Tale,'' set in San Francisco, came
out last year.
</P>
<P>
   Now they weekend on six acres in Sonoma, where Wolfert is
growing wild greens from seeds she has collected all over the
Mediterranean. In the city, she's friendly with restaurateur Alice
Waters, cookbook writer Carol Field, and author Peggy
Knickerbocker. It took some time to settle into this life.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you live in New York, you come up in the trenches
shoulder to shoulder,'' she says. ``In San Francisco, it takes a
long time to make a best friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfert stocks her larder mostly from Kalustiyan, the Manhattan
purveyor of Middle Eastern foods. She and Bayer live on
California's ``unbelievable'' produce, her own greens, and Sonoma
lamb. Her house salad comes from Greek Cyprus and combines shredded
savoy cabbage, baby spinach, arugula, cilantro, scallions, and
green olives tossed with a lemon and olive oil dressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blending greens is the art,'' she says. ``If I tell you to use
Swiss chard, and it doesn't look good, don't buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfert wants cooks to try uncommon ingredients. ``In the
Mediterranean, you have a meal and you think you'll never reproduce
it at home. But now you can make the dish and share it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soon you'll see these greens everywhere,'' she says. She keeps
repeating this, not so much to amass support for her book but
because she knows something we don't: Jean-Georges Vongerichten,
the celebrated, much imitated, New York chef, hired Francois
Couplan, an ethnobotanist who lives in Switzerland, to teach him
about leafy greens and weeds. Someone grows them for Vongerichten
in upstate New York. They're all over the Jean Georges menu.
</P>
<P>
   So it shall be.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MASON, N.H. _ Writer, illustrator, and local celebrity Elizabeth
Orton Jones is having lunch at Pickity Place, a storybook cottage
set deep in the woods that has special meaning to her.
</P>
<P>
   Half a century ago Jones, now 88, used this house as the model
for the illustration of her most famous children's book, the Little
Golden Book edition of ``Little Red Riding Hood.'' Pickity Place
was Grandmother's house.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Pickity Place, now a herb garden and restaurant, is
something of a shrine to Little Red Riding Hood, and is decorated
with framed reproductions of Jones's book and assorted Red Riding
Hood souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   The visit by the author has not gone unnoticed. Like the Big Bad
Wolf, a waitress is lurking nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard a rumor,'' the waitress finally blurts out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes?'' says Jones, who hasn't published a book in recent years
but is amid a burst of creative energy that she hopes will soon
lead to new works.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard you're the lady who wrote the book.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I did,'' says Jnes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so privileged!'' the high-school aged waitress utters.
``But let me get this straight: This is Grandmother's house, and
you live in Red Riding Hood's House?''
</P>
<P>
   ``She walked all the way here,'' Jones says evenly. ``Quite a
walk for a 4-year-old, don't you think?''
</P>
<P>
   That she wrote the country's best-known version of the classic
Grimm &UR;  &LR; Brothers story _ the Golden Book version published in
1945 &UR;  &LR; that was a staple of American home libraries _ may always be
Elizabeth Orton Jones's major claim to fame. (``The royalty
checks,'' she recalls, ``just kept pouring in and pouring in.'')
</P>
<P>
   It's been out of print since 1979, and collectors have paid up
to $100 for a copy of that 25-cent Little Golden Book, with its
timeless, moody illustrations set in rural southern New Hampshire.
 &UR;  &LR;  But the fact is, Jones &UR;  &LR; says, ``it's kind of uncomfortable being
tied to Little Red Riding Hood.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 22 other books that she has written or illustrated, or
both, most of them children's books, and she is fiercely proud of
all of them. One of the books she illustrated, ``Prayer for a
Child,'' won the coveted Caldecott medal for distinguished
illustration in 1945, and she still hears from old readers who
remember her work and ``feel the feeling I have about those
things'' in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honest to Pete, I get telephone calls out of the blue, from
Texas, from Florida,'' says Jones. ``The last one said, `I just
felt like calling you up because I can't forget that funny little
bird in the beginning of `Small Rain.' He was a grown man!''
</P>
<P>
   But the reality is that it isn't easy to sustain a publishing
reputation over so many years, not when you're old and it's an
effort to even locate an editor, let alone find one who wants to
work with you.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old editors used to guide you,'' she says. ``They would
come and visit and stay for the weekend and talk over things and
look over your drawings. Now Simon &AMP; Schuster is like a big city.''
</P>
<P>
   All but one of her books, ``Prayer for a Small Child,'' are out
of print, and it's been a good 20 years since her last one was
published. The library in nearby Peterborough keeps only a handful
of her titles. At Simon &AMP; Schuster, which reissued ``Prayer for a
Child'' last year, a publicist acknowledges she isn't familiar with
Jones's other work.
</P>
<P>
   But things have always happened spontaneously and unexpectedly
to Jones, and now something like that is happening again. Here she
is at 88, and after a long stretch of time doing other projects and
``a period of lapse because I haven't been exactly well,'' there
are all of a sudden more books in her head than she knows what to
do with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuesday, I wrote them down, just for the heck of it,'' she
says. ``My books of the future. There are eight in all. I'll be 100
by the time I get done. That's what I get so frantic about: Each
one of these books represents at least a year, and you don't make
them like pancakes, you know. You need time in between.
</P>
<P>
   ``I &UR;  &LR; just pray,'' she says, ``there won't be another new one
coming along.''
</P>
<P>
   Age has slowed a few things about Elizabeth Orton Jones. There
is her vertigo, and the fact that her eyes are ``not too hot.''
When she first enters a darkened room, she sees only black ghosts
where the people are. And there's been the trouble with her wrists
since she fell a year ago. Now it's hard for her to hold a pen, and
nearly impossible to paint. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight-eight is not easy,'' says Jones, a white halo of hair
surrounding her head. ``It's very scary, as a matter of fact.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  But one thing that has not slowed down is her imagination.
Her ideas spill out faster than she can process them, layering
themselves into richly textured stories full of fantasy figures and
adventure. She sees stories everywhere she goes _ in the Pickity
Place parking lot where she imagines that her small white car (its
name is ``Snow White'') had its lunch too, a meal of ``gravy
gasoline.'' Or in her lush green yard near a brook, where she
describes an opening in the trees as ``the Gateway to Fairyland.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything,'' Jones posits, ``is a story, was a story.''
</P>
<P>
   She learned this from her mother, who as a young woman had spent
a year traveling the world. ``Every morning, I sat for an hour on a
little stool in front of my mother, who curled my hair,'' recalled
Jones, who grew up in Highland Park, Ill. ``One hour! And during
that time I heard one story after another'' _ exotic, faraway
stories about Chinese dowagers with porcelain faces and tiny shoes,
about a whole town of people in the shadow of Mount Vesuvius,
living beneath the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The joy of creating stories from life's experiences, or imagined
experiences, gripped the young Elizabeth. ``I've had many, many
friends that aren't real, that are imaginary,'' she says. She
studied art in Chicago and Paris, then began to write and
illustrate storybooks, many of them derived from her own life.
</P>
<P>
   Most were written in Mason, where she bought a house in 1944,
when she just happened to be passing through town on a business
trip. (``It happened in about two seconds _ `I'll take it,' I
said!'')
</P>
<P>
   She called the house Misty Meadow, and it became the inspiration
for Red Riding Hood's home in the Little Golden Book. Today, Jones
actually lives in two houses; they are half a mile apart on the
same road. Misty Meadow is the old and messy one where her papers
and books are spread all over the floor and where she prefers to
sleep at night. The other house is Rock-a-Bye, the newer, airy
house with high ceilings and cabinets that she had built to
displays her books and special treasures.
</P>
<P>
   Rock-a-Bye is also where Jones receives her steady stream of
visitors. They include children who like to talk to her about
drawing, and history buffs who want to talk to her about her
``dearest project,'' the biography she is researching on Samuel
Wilson, the 18th-century Mason resident who was the original
``Uncle Sam.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Everyone who visits must sign her guest book, and almost
everyone inscribes it with some variant of ``You are such an
inspiration to me.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``I don't know why,'' she says. ``What do you think of a life
like this?''
</P>
<P>
   She means a life lived impetuously and unconventionally, at
least for a woman born in 1910. She never married _ there were too
many stories to write. And ``I have nothing to do with things like
breakfast and bridge and watching TV,'' she says, or the ``ordinary
claptrap'' of common conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does she have anything to do with ordinary ways of measuring
time. ``I don't go by seasons,'' says Jones. Instead, she goes by
decades, or ``10-year things,'' as she puts it.
</P>
<P>
   Next, she hopes, there will be the decade of all those books.
The memoir, and the Uncle Sam book, and the stories about Miss
Mickelmuff the cat, and Caleb and the fairies, and Smidge and the
brook, among others.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, though, there is that awful sense of urgency.
``I have all these darned books to write, and not terribly much
time,'' says Jones. ``I'm all the time frustrated. Eighty-eight is
no joke.''

BOSTON UNIVERSITY'S SCIENTOLOGY CONNECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston University has the faculty, staff, and financial
resources to become one of the nation's great research
institutions. One obstacle in that path has always been the
unpredictable behavior of John Silber, a master builder whose norms
of academic freedom are not universally accepted. It is also hard
to take seriously a university where the president, Jon Westling,
lacks the basic teaching credential _ a doctoral degree _ required
of assistant professors nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   It is not widely known that the man to whom both Silber and
Westling answer is Boston lawyer Earle Cooley, chairman of the BU
board of trustees and chairman of the board's executive committee.
For over a decade, Cooley has zealously defended the interests of
the Church of Scientology, which a 1991 Time magazine cover story
called ``a hugely profitable global racket that survives by
intimidating members and critics in a Mafia-like manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooley, a BU alumnus who loves BU and has devoted his time,
money, and legal skills to the university, says _ and Silber agrees
_ that his alliance with Scientology has never colored his work for
what was once one of America's great Methodist institutions. But
whenever Cooley and I discussed the excesses committed during cases
on which he worked _ the illegal harassment of a journalist, for
instance _ he said he had no knowledge of illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
   I contend that Cooley is more than ``just'' a lawyer for
Scientology. I say he is deeply allied with one of the great
anti-intellectual movements of our time, and his activities are
wildly incompatible with his status as a top official of a major
American university.
</P>
<P>
   Cooley's first high-profile involvement with Scientology came in
1986, when he attended the deathbed of church founder L. Ron
Hubbard. Three days later, Cooley participated in the first public
discussion of Hubbard's death, telling a gathering of the faithful
that ``this mighty Thetan (in Scientology lore, the Thetans were
spirits banished to Earth 75 million years ago by a cruel galactic
ruler named Xenu)'' had decided ``to continue his work outside the
confines of his body.''
</P>
<P>
   During most of the following decade, Cooley served as ``national
trial counsel'' for the Church. In 1995, he accompanied federal
marshals on a raid of the house of one of the Church's opponents,
according to several published reports. He has criticized
Northeastern University for allowing an anonymous Church critic to
post anti-Scientology messages using Northeastern's computers. He
has said more than once that journalists and others who investigate
the church should not be surprised to find themselves investigated.
</P>
<P>
   This has become a self-fulfilling prophecy. While Cooley was
waging a vigorous, pre-publication campaign against the Time cover
story, a private investigator working for the church illegally
obtained reporter Richard Behar's credit report. Cooley told me he
knew the reporter was being investigated, but claims ignorance of
illegal acts.
</P>
<P>
   Cooley issued the same warning about being investigated to
Boston Herald reporter Joseph Mallia, in connection with a series
that was printed this spring. Indeed, the Herald reported that a
private investigator for the Church contacted Mallia's ex-wife
seeking ``derogatory information.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't retain any investigator,'' says Cooley, who is
generally careful to distinguish the activities of his client from
his own affairs. Although he says he has been correctly quoted on
the subject of his church membership in the past, when he spoke
openly about being a Scientologist, he won't discuss it now. ``That
question is inappropriate,'' he says. ``It suggests a litmus test
as to whether I'm a credible person or not.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Silber expressed admiration for Cooley and his
services to BU. ``Earle Cooley is a superb trial lawyer,'' he said.
``I can't sit in judgment over the clients he has.'' Asked for his
own views on Scientology, Silber said, ``It's a very successful
for-profit business. I don't believe it's a religion.''

IN CAMBRIDGE, A LEGEND IS BORN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANN MULLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ By now, the story has become legend _ at
least in Internet circles.
</P>
<P>
   Two professors and a graduate student at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology _ Richard Bolt, Leo Beranek, and Robert
Newman _ formed a consulting company in Cambridge that wound up
building the first chunks of the global computer network now known
as the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies, universities, and government agencies
collaborated to build the Internet, but no one participant is more
closely identified with the project than Bolt, Beranek and Newman,
later known as BBN Corp.
</P>
<P>
   When they formed the company in 1948, the trio was focused on
acoustics _ the study of sound _ not advanced computing. One of
their most prominent assignments was designing the acoustics for
the grand hall of the United Nations building on Manhattan's East
River.
</P>
<P>
   But in the late 1950s, the company's involvement with computers
began to grow, inspired by a brilliant BBN scientist named J.C.R.
Licklider, who believed computers should be more than just giant
calculators. He saw them as communications devices and helped turn
BBN into a center for computer research.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, Licklider left BBN to take a job at the Pentagon's
Advanced Research Projects Agency, where he established the program
that eventually led to construction of a computer network called
the ARPANET.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, BBN won the contract to build the first legs of the
network, connecting computers at four major universities in the
West. More universities and research agencies were linked up, until
the ARPANET evolved into a series of commercial regional
subnetworks that eventually made the ARPANET obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   BBN, which was acquired by GTE Corp. last year, is now one of
the largest providers of the Internet backbone, the infrastructure
that carries network traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Cambridge and BBN are famous for another important Internet
development, too _ the first electronic mail message between two
computers.
</P>
<P>
   A BBN engineer, Ray Tomlinson, managed the feat in 1972, but
first he had to figure out a way to separate, in the e-mail
address, the name of the user from the machine the person was
using. He needed a character that could not possibly be found in a
user's name.
</P>
<P>
   He studied the keyboard in front of him, and quickly zeroed in
on the (AT) sign. Not only was it a unique character that wouldn't
appear in someone's name, it had the added advantage of meaning
``at'' the designated computer.

 By JOANN MULLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Nearly 30 years after a handful of scientists in
Cambridge laid the foundation for the global computer network we
now know as the Internet, a new generation of Boston-area
entrepreneurs has emerged with a dream: to find a way to make money
from it.
</P>
<P>
   With a few exceptions, Massachusetts' Internet companies lack
the notoriety of the splashy West Coast firms grabbing all the
headlines for their efforts to bring consumers to the World Wide
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Companies such as Yahoo Inc., the leader in Internet gateway
sites, and Amazon.com, the giant virtual bookstore, were among the
first to exploit the Internet's commercial potential.
</P>
<P>
   But while these Internet pioneers have built strong brand names
and attracted investors in droves, they've yet to prove they can
actually make money from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   That's the challenge facing virtually every company building its
business around the Web, including the hundreds of tiny start-ups
in Massachusetts that represent the Bay State's next wave of
Internet innovators.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these new companies are setting up shop in Cambridge,
the home of the original Internet pioneer, Bolt, Beranek and Newman
Corp., an acoustics research company that built the first chunk of
the Internet in California in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   BBN Corp., later renamed GTE Internetworking following its 1997
acquisition by GTE Corp., will share the limelight later this month
with many of these emerging Internet companies at a special
Internet Founders Day celebration sponsored by the Massachusetts
Software Council.
</P>
<P>
   The event on Sept. 24 is a chance to commemorate the
contributions that BBN and its team of Cambridge scientists made to
the development of the Internet on the eve of its 30-year
anniversary. But the focus will be just as much on the future and
the many young companies that hope to play a role in transforming
the Internet into a useful business tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cambridge is where the Internet started, but there's all kinds
of stuff still happening here around the Internet,'' said Joyce
Plotkin, software council president. ``We don't know which of these
will be the next huge company, but that's not really the point. The
point is that there's a lot going on, a lot bubbling up.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, more than 400 Internet-related companies are in the Bay
State _ 45 percent more than a year ago _ according to the software
council. In fact, about one in six of the state's 2,500 software
companies is Internet-related.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only a couple have matured _ by Internet standards
anyway _ to achieve the kind of consumer brand equity that Yahoo
and Amazon.com enjoy. Lycos Inc. of Waltham started out by offering
computer users a way to search the World Wide Web and &UR;  &LR; has evolved
into an Internet gateway, or portal. Open Market Inc. of Burlington
is a pioneer for its electronic commerce software.
</P>
<P>
   A few local companies have shown such promise that they have
already been acquired by larger firms. PlanetAll Inc., a leader in
the creation of on-line communities, was acquired earlier this
summer by Amazon.com for $88 million; ViaWeb, &UR;  &LR; which set the
standard for quick set-up of on-line stores, was acquired by Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   Others, such as Allaire Corp., which makes tools that allow
companies to develop interactive Web sites, have announced plans to
sell shares to the public. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   But the majority of Internet-related firms in Massachusetts are
just getting off the ground. They've typically raised a few million
dollars in venture capital funding and have no more than a few
dozen employees.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they specialize in providing software tools or services,
the objective of virtually all of these firms is to help businesses
use the Web more efficiently to reach customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is going to impact your business, whether you
like it or not,'' said Paul Gudonis, president of GTE
Internetworking.
</P>
<P>
   Such a prediction spells opportunity for companies like
Mainspring Communications of Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   The company was formed in the summer of 1996 by John Connolly,
an entrepreneur and former publishing executive with Reading-based
Addison-Wesley. Connolly's vision was to offer businesses a Web
site for learning more about Internet technology. But he soon
realized firms didn't need more technical information about the
Internet. They wanted advice to help them understand the business
impact of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found a real disconnect between the hype of the Internet
and `How do I really deal with my customer today on the Internet'''
Connolly said. ``We're seeing the American business executive in
significant pain when it comes to `What should I do with the
Internet?'''
</P>
<P>
   Many companies ``were on the Web for the sake of the Web,''
explained Ruth Habbe, Mainspring's senior vice president of
marketing. But they never stopped to ask what kind of business
sense that made.

 BOSTON: ... sense that made.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mainspring's response was to develop an accelerated six-step
process to help businesses align their Internet initiatives with
their overall business objectives.
</P>
<P>
   Through a series of intensive, one-day consulting sessions,
Mainspring forces a company's executives ``to stop and ask
themselves all the questions they never bothered to ask
themselves,'' Habbe said.
</P>
<P>
   The concept seems obvious, Connolly acknowledged, but
Mainspring's business model _ sort of a cross between a research
firm and a consulting firm _ is unique. In the first three months
it has been marketing its services, Mainspring has signed up 30
big-name clients, including Citibank, Fleet Financial Group,
BankBoston Corp, and Scudder Kemper Investments.
</P>
<P>
   Mainspring has raised $14 million in venture capital. For now,
it is focused on helping financial services clients, said Connolly,
but it soon will expand to include retailers and manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no one better represents the new generation of Internet
entrepreneurs than the founder of Webline Communications, Pasha
Roberts. His father, Larry Roberts, was part of the team that
developed the ARPANET, the government-funded computer network that
evolved into today's Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his father's role, Pasha Roberts was already familiar
with the vast computer network and understood well its potential
impact on businesses.
</P>
<P>
   As a graduate student at MIT's Sloan School of Management,
Roberts came up with the idea of using Internet technology to
improve the operation of telephone call centers both for customer
service and on-line retailing.
</P>
<P>
   He and a fellow graduate student, Firdaus Bhathena, devised a
business plan, which won the 1996 MIT $50K Entrepreneurship
Competition. With that boost and some additional venture capital
funding, Webline developed a prototype for its ``teleweb'' service
and recruited a top management team, many of them from Avid
Technology Inc., a successful Tewksbury-based digital editing firm.
</P>
<P>
   The notion behind Webline is simple, said president and chief
executive Dan Keshian, Avid's former president: ``We provide human
assistance to electronic commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Many studies have shown that consumers are reluctant to buy
goods and services over the Web until they're able to interact with
a real person, he said. Sometimes, they're concerned about
security, he said, but often they just want an experienced
salesperson to reassure them that they're buying what they really
want.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people just can't bring themselves to engage in this
self-service model,'' Keshian said. ``If you're in a furniture
store, you want to talk to the salesperson about whether the wood
is real, for instance.''
</P>
<P>
   That need for customer assistance is especially keen in the
corporate world when the purchase involves something complicated
such as a computer or a database.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to make sure it's right. You can't make a mistake,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Webline's technology allows a company's service representatives
to interact with customers simultaneously over the telephone and
the Web. While talking to the consumer on the phone, the service
representative is able to take control of the customer's Web
browser remotely and walk the customer through a product
demonstration, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Webline has been shipping its products since late last year, and
its revenues, while undisclosed, are estimated at between $5
million and $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we build the business correctly, an IPO is definitely in
our future,'' said Keshian.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Open Sesame of Cambridge had its early roots at BBN.
</P>
<P>
   Alper Caglayan and Greg Zacharias were senior scientists at BBN
when they decided in 1983 to form their own consulting company to
provide artificial intelligence for the military and other
government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, they formed a commercial division, Open Sesame, which
developed intelligent agent software for desktop computers. The
software was able to learn the repetitive behaviors of the user and
automatically customize the desktop applications to suit those
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the pair shifted gears again and turned Open Sesame
into an Internet-based tool, allowing companies to personalize
their businesses by nonintrusively learning the interests and
tastes of the customers who visit their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Caglayan compares Open Sesame to a seasoned salesperson at your
favorite store. After a few visits, the salesperson comes to learn
your wardrobe preferences.
</P>
<P>
   The product attracted a lot of attention, and perhaps not
surprisingly, a fair number of buyout offers.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, Open Sesame agreed to be acquired by Bowne &AMP; Co. Inc.
of Toronto, a 223-year-old financial printing company that is
transforming itself into an information management company.
</P>
<P>
   The company, now part of subsidiary known as Bowne Internet
Solutions, remains in Cambridge, however, and continues to grow.
It's about to double the number of employees to 50 and is moving to
larger quarters in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of job growth is undoubtedly the best part about the
explosion of Internet-related companies in the Boston area, said
Gudonis, adding that GTE Internetworking has created more than
1,000 new jobs around the Internet in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the decline of the minicomputer companies, we're seeing
a resurgence of Cambridge and Route 128 around the Internet,'' he
said. ``Justice prevails, because it started here.''

   This Cypriot version of a Greek salad is so popular that, in the
words of Niki Moquist, the Cypriot- American who provided the
recipe, ``it is served almost every day in almost every home except
in the heat of summer, when it would be too hot to gather the
greens.''
</P>
<P>

   Juice of 1/2 lemon or more to taste

   2 to 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

   1 small wedge of savoy or regular green cabbage, washed,
drained, dried, and finely shredded ( 1/2 cup)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup washed, drained, dried, stemmed, and torn arugula leaves

SAMIRA'S TABBOULEH WITH PARSLEY, CINNAMON, AND CUMIN
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Samira was like an alchemist with spices as she made this
tabbouleh in Israel. In my view, tabbouleh is not really a grain
salad, rather a dense parsley salad that includes some bulgur.
Serve this tabbouleh with toasted pita bread or romaine lettuce
leaves.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup fine-grain bulgur
</P>
<P>
   3 packed cups stemmed flat-leaf parsley, washed and completely
dried
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup fresh lemon, lime, verjuice, or sour green grape juice
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt or more to taste
</P>
<P>
   6 scallions, white plus 4 inches green leaves, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon ground Ceylon cinnamon or more to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon ground cumin or more to taste
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of Turkish red pepper
</P>
<P>
   Pinches of sugar to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 large red ripe tomato, peeled, seeded, and chopped
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup finely shredded aromatic mint leaves, preferably
spearmint
</P>
<P>
   1 head romaine lettuce
</P>
<P>
   Place the bulgur in a fine sieve. Shake it to remove any dust.
Rinse under cool running water and drain. Let stand 10 minutes,
then press out all moisture. Meanwhile, finely chop the parsley.
</P>
<P>
   In a mixing bowl, combine everything but the mint and romaine,
blending well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours before
serving (it tastes even better after 24 hours). Fold in the mint,
correct the seasoning, and serve with the lettuce leaves.

<P>
   Serves 4.

DEEP-DISH LEAFY GREENS AND CLAMS WITH POTATOES A LA IMPORTANCIA
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A la importancia'' in Spain means ``to presume to be more
important than you are.'' Potatoes are given that kind of
importance here. They're boiled, sliced, rolled in seasoned coarse
bread crumbs, then pan-fried with clams. As the potatoes brown, a
crisp crust develops. The dish is then served around a heap of
peppered greens. Thanks to chef Joe Simone for this recipe.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds fresh flat-leaf spinach or mixed braising greens,
washed, stemmed, and drained
</P>
<P>
   Coarse sea salt
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds (24 pieces) small littleneck clams
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 to 3 pounds Yukon gold potatoes or other firm-flesh
potatoes
</P>
<P>
   1 cup coarsely ground dry bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 tablespoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   3 anchovy fillets, soaked in milk, rinsed, and drained
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of crushed chili flakes without seeds
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons meat, poultry, or vegetable stock
</P>
<P>
   Tiny pinch of grated nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons pine nuts
</P>
<P>
   At least 2 1/2 hours before serving, cut the greens into
1-inch-thick ribbons and toss with the sea salt. Let stand in a
colander to wilt.
</P>
<P>
   Rinse the clams under cool running water and scrub away any
traces of sand. Soak in lightly salted water for 1 hour and drain
well.
</P>
<P>
   Wash and scrub the potatoes and boil until barely tender, 6 to
10 minutes, depending upon size. Drain the potatoes, reserving 2
cups of the potato water, and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Season the bread crumbs with salt and freshly ground pepper and
place in a deep bowl. When the potatoes are cool enough to handle,
peel them and slice into 1/4-inch disks. As you slice, dip each
potato into the bread crumbs and place on a paper-towel-lined tray,
slightly overlapping, to dry.
</P>
<P>
   Rinse the wilted spinach to remove the salt and squeeze the
leaves dry. Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a small skillet
and saute the garlic until golden, about 1 minute. Add the
anchovies and crush to a puree. Stir in the chili flakes, greens,
and stock. Cook, covered, over medium heat until tender. Season
with grated nutmeg, black pepper, and salt to taste. Keep warm in a
double boileror over low heat, partially covered, until ready to
serve.
</P>
<P>
   You will need 2 large nonstick skillets for this step. Divide
the drained clams and the remaining 4 tablespoons of olive oil
between the 2 skillets and heat. Cook the clams for 1 minute, add
the potatoes and parsley in one layer, surrounding the clams,
loosely cover the skillets, and cook 3 to 4 minutes. Adjust the
heat so as to not burn the potatoes. Remove the clams to a side
dish as they open. When the potatoes develop a golden brown crust,
flip them over, add the pine nuts, and continue to cook, loosely
covered, until the potatoes brown on the second side and the pine
nuts begin to turn golden brown. If the potatoes absorb the pan
juices too quickly and start to burn, sprinkle with a few teaspoons
of the reserved potato water.
</P>
<P>
   Place the greens in the center of a warm serving platter and
surround with the potatoes, clams, and pine nuts. Add a little
potato water to each skillet and quickly deglaze, then pour the
juices over the greens. Serve at once.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.

49ERS PROSPERING WITH MOTHER LODE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charley Casserly had just seen his team get burned by the
red-hot San Francisco 49ers and offered this toast:
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now there is no team out there that's as good on offense
as they are. No one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington general manager was speaking of the team that
hammered his Redskins, 45-10, at home Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   This opening charge by San Francisco, which dodged the Jets,
36-30, in overtime a week earlier, is one of the best offensive
displays in NFL history. The 49ers are No. 1 in the league on
offense with 1,061 yards, the second-best total in NFL history for
two weeks. Only the explosive no-huddle offense of Jim Kelly,
Thurman Thomas, and the Buffalo Bills of 1991 was better, piling up
1,116.
</P>
<P>
   ``Garrison Hearst and the third-receiver package they have make
this team different than the ones in the past,'' said Casserly.
``Hearst gives them great speed and quickness in the running game.
He's a darter and makes the tacklers miss. The three-receivers _
with (Jerry) Rice, (J.J.) Stokes, and (Terrell) Owens _ is just
impossible to deal with. All of them are very tall. There isn't a
team in the league that has three defensive backs with the size and
ability to cover those guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Steve Young is on top of his game. He made great throws
all night against us. We had some guys in his face, but it didn't
matter. He still made the throws.''
</P>
<P>
   The 0-2 Redskins go to Seattle and then Denver, two teams that
are undefeated and playing some of the best football in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great opening schedule, isn't it?,'' said Casserly.
``But we have to find a way to survive it.''
</P>

   Neither GM Floyd Reese nor head coach Jeff Fisher is happy with
the play of the 1-1 Tennessee Oilers, the Patriots' next opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are better than this,'' said Reese Tuesday. ``We just
haven't played up to our ability, and I don't know what it is. We
beat Cincinnati (on the road), but it wasn't a great game for us.
Then we lost at home to San Diego last Sunday in a game we thought
we were going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just not in sync on offense,'' said Fisher. ``We gave up
just 13 points to San Diego, and when that happens, you should win
the game. But our offense could never get any rhythm going. We came
down the field at the beginning of the game, scored, had a
touchdown called back, and couldn't get it going the rest of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They held Eddie George to 11 yards in 15 carries, but we like
to have him get the ball a lot more than that. San Diego did a good
job of stopping our run game. They had Ryan Leaf play a very
conservative game. They tried to make it easy for him so he didn't
make any mistakes and turn the ball over. He made some throws he
would like to have back, but they didn't hurt him. We know we've
got our hands full going up there to New England this week.''
</P>
<P>

   Quarterback Scott Mitchell's days with the Detroit Lions appear
to be numbered. The Lions are 0-2, and Mitchell handed the home
opener to Cincinnati in overtime Sunday. Mitchell almost gave the
Bengals the game in regulation when he threw a terrible
interception in the closing minutes. He was bailed out when the
Lions blocked a field goal attempt. However, in overtime, he made
another terrible throw that Corey Sawyer picked off and returned 58
yards for a touchdown. Mitchell completely misread the play. He was
supposed to throw a quick 5-yarder to Johnnie Morton for a first
down on a slant. If that wasn't there, Morton was supposed to go
deep and Mitchell was supposed to look to his second read, Herman
Moore, who was wide open. For some reason, Mitchell threw a
sideline pass behind Morton, who had gone deep, and Sawyer accepted
the gift.

   Larry Kennan, who is president of the Coaches Association in the
NFL, feels his group has made a big step forward by hooking up with
the NFL Players Association. ``This is very important to us,'' said
Kennan from Washington Tuesday. ``The Players Association is very
supportive of what we are trying to do for the assistant coaches in
this league. We have two major issues. First, the retirement age is
65 before we can collect our pensions. The problem is, very few
coaches are still working in the league at that age. Right now only
7 percent of the 400 assistant coaches in the league are over 60
years of age. What happens is that a coach is let go when he is 55
or so, after coaching all of his life, and he can't get a job. Then
he has to wait 10 years to collect. At the same time, he has no
medical coverage or benefits, which is our second issue. The owners
say they are willing to help us out, but we haven't sat down and
worked out anything yet. We have figured it out that the typical
assistant coach in the NFL works 2 1/2 times as many hours per year
as the average working man. During the season, the coaches average
80 hours a week, and from training camp in July to the end of the
season, the only time he gets a day off is during the bye week, or
just three days off over a six-month period.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Doug Flutie told Rick Gosselin of the Dallas Morning News that
after he is finished playing in the NFL, whenever that is, he would
like to go back and play in Canada for two more years. That's how
much he loves the Canadian Football League. Flutie said playing for
Buffalo in the NFL ``is icing on the cake.'' ... Brett Favre, who
is off to a sensational start, has 46 completions in two games, but
15 of them were to running back Dorsey Levens, who is out for two
months with a broken leg ... One reason the Falcons are 2-0: Their
defense against the run is the best in the league, allowing 58.5
yards per game. Atlanta has an open date, but then that defense
will get a big test in San Francisco. The 49ers have a great chance
of being 7-0 when they go to Bay Nov. 1. After Atlanta, they play
Buffalo, New Orleans, Indianapolis, and St. Louis ... Some early
trends. There were 49 rushing touchdowns in the first two weeks,
most for that period since 1989. Field goals are down. In 1996 and
1997, 100 field goals were made in the first two weeks; this year
that has dropped to 75. Are coaches going more for TDs and less for
FGs in close? The average rushing yardage is 227.2 yards per game,
the most in 10 years, while at the same time, the total of 164
sacks (zone dogs and blitzes) is the most since 1985.

THERMO ELECTRON PREPARES TO PASS THE TORCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brothers John and George Hatsopoulos, who have spent 40 years
building Thermo Electron Corp. into one of the premier technology
companies, are laying out plans to turn the business over to a new
generation of executives.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Waltham, Mass. company named four
executives as co-chief operating officers, in day-to-day charge of
managing Thermo's business units. The new group was widely seen as
a competitive bracket of managers who are in the running to succeed
chief executive George Hatsopoulos, 71.
</P>
<P>
   Just Tuesday, John Hatsopoulos announced he would retire in
January but stay on the board as a nonexecutive vice chairman. John
Hatsopoulos, who was the company's president for years, has served
as Thermo's top financial executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a certain point I had to leave it to someone younger,''
said John Hatsopoulos, 64. ``I'm still going to be around.'' He
will be succeeded as chief financial officer by Theo Melas-Kyriazi,
39.
</P>
<P>
   George and John Hatsopoulos developed dozens of technical and
scientific businesses following broad global trends since they
created Thermo Electron in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   First the company focused on power systems used in space while
George Hatsopoulos studied at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. Later, the company focused on energy and the
environment. Health care is a big theme for the future. Today,
Thermo generates revenue approaching $4 billion and operating
earnings that will probably come in at about $400 million this
year, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   But Thermo watchers had been anxious for the Hatsopoulos
brothers to begin to lay out a plan that would establish the
company's next generation of managers, particularly as its stock
continued to slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been brilliant guys, but at some point it's time to
pass the torch,'' said analyst Angus MacDonald of Lehman Brothers.
``I think this is the beginning of a needed, articulated transition
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   The big question: Who will be Thermo's chief executive of the
future? Among the contenders, currently co-chief operating
officers:
</P>
<P>
   _Earl Lewis, 54, oversees instrumentation and, on paper, is in
the strongest position. The businesses that report to him account
for about 55 percent of Thermo Electron revenue.
</P>
<P>
   _John Keiser, 62, is head of biomedical and new technologies.
Keiser is running the second-largest business and managing lines
that are important to Thermo's future. But he could be approaching
65 by the time a succession plan is complete.
</P>
<P>
   _Brian Holt, 49, is in charge of environmental and energy units,
the group that most closely resembles Thermo's business roots. Holt
is young and well-regarded, but his unit is a relatively small part
of the company.
</P>
<P>
   _William Rainville, 56, is chief of Thermo's recycling and
recovery systems. Rainville's business lines also account for a
small part of Thermo's revenue and profits.
</P>
<P>
   Both Hatsopoulos brothers agree Thermo's future chief executive
is probably one of those four executives, without saying much about
any of them or when one will be chosen. But they acknowledge that
investors were anxious to see a process in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there were lingering concerns for two or three years as
far as what happens in the succession,'' said George Hatsopoulos.
``People are afraid when they see successful companies going from
one generation to another. Usually this is a very risky period.
We're trying to do as good a job as possible in this change, but
it's always an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   No one would argue over Thermo's long-term success, but the
succession steps are taking place as Thermo Electron stock scrapes
along a five-year low. Thermo shares, worth 40 in April, hit bottom
at 15 1/8 last week and finished at 17 1/16 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A missed earnings estimate in the last quarter hurt, along with
two more minor financial disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   So did Thermo's dense pack of operating units that have been
spun out into public companies. The spin-out strategy was hugely
successful for years but it eventually became stretched too thin,
with 23 majority-owned companies. Investors complained first, and
Thermo eventually agreed last month to consolidate the units in 16
companies, a process that is just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have gotten the message and are de-complicating this
thing,'' said MacDonald.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts like MacDonald and John Duffy of Fahnestock &AMP; Co.
believe fewer public units will make Thermo Electron easier to
understand for investors and, more important, create bigger
spinoffs with greater stock market liquidity.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, George Hatsopoulos does not appear ready to step into
actual retirement very soon. Though older than his brother, he
insists his present role overseeing other managers who run Thermo's
daily business is much more manageable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a job that is more suitable to both my personality and my
age,'' he said.

THORNTON HAS A SECOND CHANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The absence of free-agent forwards Jason Allison, Ted
Donato, and Anson Carter is bad news for the Bruins as a whole, but
it opens up a mile-wide opportunity for 19-year-old Joe Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   The young center came into camp last year with more hype than
any Bruin had had in a very long time. Part of it was the fact that
Boston had such a dismal season the year before, finishing last
overall in the league and missing the playoffs for the first time
in 30 years. Part of it was that Thornton was the No. 1 overall
pick in the draft. Add to that Thornton's imposing 6-foot-4-inch
size and his willingness to scrap, and the expectations were
enormous despite coach Pat Burns's caution.
</P>
<P>
   The reality of Thornton's rookie season was that, as easy as he
thought it was going to be, that's just how hard it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was going to be like junior _ just come in and
score a lot of points and be happy,'' said Thornton, who missed 19
games because of injuries. ``It was a little bit different coming
in and seeing some guys who were 30 and just huge. They're not boys
no more.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton knew next to nothing about professional conditioning
and even less about nutrition. Pizza and doughnuts were staples in
his diet, and trainer Don Del Negro used to chide Thornton about
his love of pepperoni. That changed gradually, with the youngster
giving up his favorite foods for more nutritious choices. He spent
this summer working out with conditioning coach Mike Boyle. He
added bulk and strength, and with the knowledge he acquired in his
first season, he is expecting it all to pay off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a little bit more this year than last year,'' he said.
``This summer I worked out a lot more. I was more focused in the
gym. All the cardio will pay off in the third period.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the expectations of some were too high last year,
Thornton said, ``That's a hard question. When you're the No. 1
pick, people are going to have expectations. I expected more.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, I want to get off to a good start. I want to score
some goals in training camp and get my feet wet. I want to go on to
the regular season with some confidence. I'm pretty confident I'll
have a good camp. I expect to play more. I want to play a lot this
year, that's for sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel way stronger. Last year I was 210, this year I'm 225. I
think it will make a world of difference. I'll be stronger pushing
off and just fighting off guys. My shot is going to be harder.
Everything is going to be a little bit better.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns brought him along slowly last season, partly because
Thornton was young, partly to protect him from the weight of
unrealistic expectations, and partly because Thornton wasn't yet
ready for the responsibility of a regular role on an NHL team.
Thornton said he couldn't have handled being thrown onto the first
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``And have me screw up? My confidence would've been shot,'' he
said. ``Last year they put me in slowly, and this year it will
hopefully be more.''
</P>
<P>
   Some factions thought Thornton would have been better served
going back to junior hockey last year. But the fact was, he was too
talented for that level and chances were good that his game
would've stagnated.
</P>
<P>
   ``In junior I wouldn't have learned anything,'' said Thornton.
``It was a good thing for me to stay up last year. It was tough.
I've always put up a lot of numbers, and when you don't, I think
it's difficult for you. I just had to say to myself every day that
it was a learning experience my first year and this year will be a
much better year for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns has noticed a difference in Thornton this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``His physical condition is much better,'' said the coach. ``He
learned a lot last year. The experience of being with pros has
definitely paid off. He's much bigger and he's growing into more of
a man's body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Joe knows what is expected of him and it won't be all
new things to him. There will be a lot of things where he knows
what we're talking about. Without putting any great expectations on
him or any kind of pressure on him, I think he can become an
important player on this hockey club.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Thornton saw a lot of fourth-line duty, with
enforcer Ken Baumgartner riding shotgun. This year, he is likely to
move up to the second line if he earns the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing with the Bomber last year, he kind of helped me out,''
said Thornton. ``He would tell me a lot. This year I'm ready to
step in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to score some goals. I think that's what they want this
year. We don't have some guys we had last year like Jason Allison
and Anson and Teddy. Some guys are going to have to pick it up a
little bit.''

CUSTOMERS GRANTED MICROSOFT ITS 90 PERCENT MARKET SHARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Barksdale, president of Netscape Communications, asked the
rhetorical question in March at the Senate Judiciary Committee. How
many spectators had computers? Hands went up. How many didn't have
Windows? Hands went down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gentlemen, that's a monopoly,'' Barksdale said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft opponents packaged this testimony into a film, which
was shown in Seattle last month at a conference on antitrust law.
It was a tub-thumper, but Payton Smith, a partner at Davis Wright
Tremaine, spotted its weakness. ``I would have been more moved by
that film if I hadn't seen so many competitors in it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton made the same point: that the complaints are
from competitors, not customers. He called the case ``a private
lawsuit being pursued by the government of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference sponsors, the Competitive Enterprise Institute
and the Washington Institute Foundation, are both inclined to favor
Microsoft. But they had speakers from both sides on the central
questions: Is Microsoft a monopoly? Is it bad? Should the
government attack it?
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's critics focused on its conduct. Microsoft, they
said, is muscling into cable TV, banking and television _ even
political magazines. ``Consumers don't like the idea of a single
firm controlling everything under the sun,'' said James Love,
executive director of Ralph Nader's Consumer Project on Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's supporters responded that the company hasn't been
able to control everything. That it has 90 percent shares in a few
markets means not that its conduct is bad, but that its products
are good. ``Products that aren't any good fail,'' said Jonathan
Zuck, director of the Association for Competitive Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Even monopoly itself does not imply high prices, they argued.
Stan Liebowitz, professor of managerial economics at the University
of Texas, said the price of Microsoft Word fell even as its market
share on the Macintosh rose to 100 percent. Microsoft had a
monopoly, he said, ``but it didn't act like a monopolist.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides claimed the mantle of competition. The anti-Microsoft
side had a genteel, supervised version of it, with a lot of little
guys, none of them playing to win. The other side gloried in
players who slugged it out.
</P>
<P>
   The slug-it-outers sometimes shrank from stating their case
plainly. I would begin such a case with an admission that Microsoft
is a monopoly _ as much as anyone is ever likely to get in an open
market.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's near-monopoly mainly reflects its CEO's skill in
strategy, not tactics. Bill Gates was the first to see that we
computer buyers are herd animals who yearn to own the same
technology as those around us. And for a good reason: We remember
what happened to our TRS-80s, Osbornes, Commodores and other
Studebakers of silicon history.
</P>
<P>
   Our rush to one technology is called a ``network effect.''
Critics advance it as an argument against Microsoft: The technology
that wins might not be the best. But that argument justifies what?
A law against network effects? An Endangered Technologies Act?
</P>
<P>
   Network effects reflect consumer choice. Microsoft has a 90
percent market share because we customers have granted it.
</P>
<P>
   It is a rational choice. We get the widest choice in
applications by accepting a standard operating system. And why not?
The operating system means little to us. It is useless by itself.
It is not so much of a product at all, said Yale University law
professor George Priest, but a kind of language.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Microsoft's critics sounded as if they wished that
language would be public property. But it isn't. It was created by
private investment and protected by copyright. The government is
not going to buy it, and Priest said, ``We can't think of how to
break up the language of Windows in a way that makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Should government regulate it? The Justice Department has given
us a sample of its brilliance in that department. Last Christmas,
it was demanding that Windows 95 be offered in a disabled edition,
with the Internet Explorer icon taken off, in order to promote
consumer choice.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative way of dealing with Microsoft's monopoly is to
leave it to us. If Microsoft gets oppressive, we can all gang up on
it and heave it out. We heaved out our vinyl LPs. We jettisoned
Beta VCRs and eight-track tapes. We knocked off Nintendo as No. 1
in video games. Right now we can choose Apple's iMac, and tomorrow,
perhaps something even better.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever gives us a compelling reason to abandon Windows will
make billions. Until then, the billions go to the owners of
Windows.

FIDELITY ROLLS OUT NEW ADS FEATURING PETER LYNCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Let's get this over with right now: Investment
guru Peter Lynch has no idea what the market will be like in six
months, a year from now or more. So stop asking.
</P>
<P>
   As for recent market plunges, he says if you can't handle the
cyclical volatility of the marketplace, maybe you shouldn't be in
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, the former portfolio manager of the Fidelity Magellan
Fund and now vice chairman of Fidelity's investment adviser
division, has been consistent in his message: People, in general,
are confused about investing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't know what the heck they're doing _ and they want
to know,'' said Lynch, who is emphasizing that theme in a new ad
campaign for Fidelity that features comedian Lily Tomlin.
</P>
<P>
   An imposingly tall man with relentlessly white hair, the
54-year-old Lynch has become a recognizable figure in investment
circles, even to the casual investor.
</P>
<P>
   But the new campaign is a departure from traditional investment
commercials featuring landscapes or pie charts.
</P>
<P>
   There's Lynch on an out-of-control treadmill, as Tomlin tries to
monitor the stress test while Lynch is explaining how the
volatility is just like the stock market. Another spot features
Tomlin as a Department of Motor Vehicles worker who attempts to
squeeze a hot stock pick from Lynch in exchange for speeding up
license renewal (he warns investing on such tips is akin to
gambling). Finally, Tomlin in her Judith Beasley housewife
character accidentally destroys a newsstand after achieving
information overload from the number of financial magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity's head of customer marketing, Stephen Cone, is credited
with lightening up Fidelity's look. Cone, who took over the
position in January, said he wanted to create memorable spots that
stood out from other investment services ads, which account for
about $4 billion in marketing dollars industrywide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking ... a bit of a risk, but even if they don't like
the ads, they'll remember them,'' said Cone, who would not reveal
the cost of the campaign. ``No one remembers financial services
advertising, so obviously the somber approach ain't working.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone said he wanted to create segments during which Lynch
interacts with someone playing different characters. Tomlin came up
because she is known for her characters, and she turned out to be a
fan of Lynch's investment approach, he said. These were the first
commercials Tomlin has ever shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like getting three actresses in one,'' said Gail
Schoenbrunn, creative director and writer with Hill, Holliday,
Connors, Cosmopolus, the Boston advertising firm that did the
spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were not easy shoots _ they're long days,'' Schoenbrunn
said. ``Here's a guy (Lynch) whose time is money. But Peter seemed
to enjoy doing them immensely _ and meeting Lily Tomlin.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Drucker, an Oakland, Calif.-based marketing and
communications consultant, said the ads helped bring a friendly
face to an industry that had been saddled with a staid,
institutional image. ``Obviously money is serious, but the economy
is fairly good,'' he said. ``You may not have seen these ads 20
years ago when inflation was 20 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said each ad had one of his primary messages: market
volatility, informed investing and information overload.
``Literally, you could learn a lot in a few minutes,'' he said,
trying to explain that people could go a long way sticking with a
few principles.

AN ANGRY MOTHER WARNS AGAINST HER SON, THE GURU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first Luna Tarlo felt like she had ``hit the lottery.'' Her
son had become a guru, a spiritual teacher who was attracting more
and more followers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, as a mother, I just felt a tremendous amount of
pride and happiness,'' says Tarlo, a writer in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly a decade later, Tarlo's joy has turned to outrage. In
a blistering book, she portrays her son, Andrew Cohen, who lives at
a center in Lenox, Mass. operated by his movement, as an arrogant,
power-hungry, dangerous figure who practices mind control over
adherents.
</P>
<P>
   Tarlo's book, ``The Mother of God,'' touches on a wider subject:
the concern within the religious community about the danger of any
self-appointed guru who demands unquestioning obedience in return
for spiritual healing.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tarlo, her son claims he found enlightenment while
working with a spiritual teacher in India. Now he is one of an
increasing number of gurus in the United States. They have
flourished, sociologists say, at a time when many Americans are
yearning for deeper spiritual meaning and in a society that looks
to experts for advice on everything from picking stocks to losing
weight.
</P>
<P>
   Problems can occur when religious teachers try to take advantage
of people's vulnerablity for their own purpose, whether financial
gain or ego gratification. Typically, these gurus enjoy enormous
influence over their followers.
</P>
<P>
   The number of members living in one of the centers operated by
Cohen's movement worldwide is believed to be in the hundreds,
although the number who follow his teachings is easily in the
thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, Tarlo claims, ``requires total surrender to him. You have
to obey everything he says and trust him 100 percent, and anybody
who disagrees is subject to derision and verbal abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, whose Moksha Foundation operates his centers worldwide,
could not be reached for comment this week. But one of his
followers who has read Tarlo's book disputes her characterization
of Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impression Luna gives in this book of Andrew as a
two-dimensional autocrat and everyone quaking in fear couldn't be
farther from the positive experience of him that I have had,'' said
Elizabeth Debold, a developmental psychologist in New York.
``Andrew has completely transformed my relationship to my life.
What is so remarkable is that Andrew is pure positivity. Andrew is
an expression of the highest human potential.''
</P>
<P>
   According to ``What is Enlightenment,'' a journal published by
the Moksha Foundation, since Cohen's ``awakening'' in 1986 he has
focused on ``the potential of total liberation from the bondage of
ignorance, superstition, and selfishness.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarlo's critics question her motivations and charge that her
angry tone is the result of her inability or unwillingness to
understand Andrew's message.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I read in the book is a mother who wants her son back,''
Debold said. ``There was never, it seems to me, a very deep
interest in spiritual growth or change. Andrew never said, `I want
people to follow me,' but people said they wanted to be near him
and to find out how he lives like he does.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tarlo says it was painful as a mother to write such a
withering assessment of her son. Part of her purpose was to
highlight the perils behind the absolutism and authoritarianism she
believes spiritual leaders like Cohen represent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my life with him is over, and it's very sad,'' she
says. ``I loved him a lot.''
</P>

Reader comments
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Joan H. McMaster, of Bristol, R.I., wrote to comment on our
recent column examining the moral dimensions of President Clinton's
affair with former White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky. She
writes: ``For someone who is a professed Christian such as Bill
Clinton, it is unbelievable he could break two commandments with
seeming disregard for the pain he has caused all players. One has
to wonder if his avowed Christianity is just that: an avowal and
nothing deeper.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Geoff DeFranca, from Watertown, N.Y., shares McMaster's
views. He says: ``We have not only lost our ability to blush, but
we have honed our skill of rationalizing every act and attitude
which is destroying us from the inside out. How much like the Roman
Empire we have become in our taste for the immoral. Let us not
forget what happened then.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan Gallagher, from Dorchester, Mass., disagrees: ``Most
of the citizens of the United States are far more comfortable with
President Bill Clinton than &UR;  &LR; the sex-obsessed far-right
conservative Republicans who have been hounding him since the first
day of his presidency. ... I am not a Bible thumper, but I love,
`Let him who is without sin cast the first stone.'''

TROY BROWN: FINALLY RECEIVING HIS DUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ This Troy Brown revival isn't a fad.
</P>
<P>
   He earned it, the old-fashioned way _ with hard work.
</P>
<P>
   For six years, Brown has sought respect. For six years he has
fought and clawed to stay in pro football. Cut twice from the
Patriots by Bill Parcells and rejected by Pete Carroll when he was
the Jets' coach in 1994, Brown has endured every imaginable slight
and indignity.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, he has fought his way through every obstacle, every
attack on his ability.
</P>
<P>
   And now when people ask about Troy Brown being a ``surprise,''
well, he's not a surprise anymore. He's gone from being the
Patriots' fourth, fifth, or sixth receiver to arguably their best
one.
</P>
<P>
   He's gone from being another ``little guy'' _ as Carroll
remembered him during a tryout at the Meadowlands _ to the little
guy the Patriots can't live without.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's mentioned in the same breath as the Wayne Chrebets of
the world, players who ``get it,'' as Parcells used to say. Now
it's no longer a happening when Brown contributes; now it's a
surprise if he doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two games of the season, Brown has caught eight
passes for 147 yards and a touchdown. He also has returned three
punts, including one for 38 yards.
</P>
<P>
   His rise has prompted Patriots management to negotiate a
multiyear contract with him, because what Brown signed for last
year was backup money. In his new deal, he'll be paid as a
prominent receiver _ probably in the $2 million-per-year range.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a possibility we could get it done this
week,'' said Brown's agent, Michael George. ``The Patriots have
been good about recognizing that they need to tie up their key
players. They also understand the contract we signed last year was
for a player in more of a role. Troy is now a big part of their
team.''
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-9-inch, 180-pound Brown was a dynamo at Marshall,
where he remains the all-time leading receiver even after Randy
Moss's tenure. But he has never taken a moment in the NFL for
granted. Not when he had to fill in for the oft-injured Terry Glenn
last year and caught 41 passes, or when the team signed receiver
Brian Stablein in the offseason to a three-year, $3 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think they needed to bring another guy in after the
year I had,'' said Brown. ``I took it as a slap in the face. It
just gave extra drive to show them who the best player was.''
</P>
<P>
   After Parcells had cut Brown in '94, Carroll was looking for a
returner/receiver type in New York. He took a look at Brown but
passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you had him on your team and realized what he could do,
it was hard to judge someone with one visit like that,'' Carroll
said.
</P>
<P>
   Now Carroll can't live without Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes plays,'' said Carroll. ``We continue to find ways to
incorporate him into our football team. Last week he had a big punt
return, caught some balls, and made some special teams tackles.
He's becoming a very valuable guy on our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown holds no grudges against Parcells or Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't proven myself,'' he said. ``I was a second-year
player. I couldn't blame Pete. It was a nervous experience because
I was unemployed. It didn't work out there, but I wound up coming
back here and that worked out for the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stayed patient and stayed in good shape. I appreciated the
chance to come back here.''
</P>
<P>
   The next crisis came in 1995 when Parcells decided to bring
aboard Dave Meggett, the former Giant, to return kicks. Then it was
obvious to Brown there was no room for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they brought Dave Meggett in,'' said Brown, ``I thought
if I could get someplace else where they didn't have as many
receivers and returners, I could show my talents. Bill Parcells
kind of talked me out of it. I asked him to cut me, but he told me
he didn't want to and that he saw a role for me. It was good
advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the first time he cut me, that was good for me because it
picked up the pace with me a little bit. From that point on, I've
gotten better and better even with limmited opportunities.''  &QL; 
 &QL; 
Working at it
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The key for Brown has remained his constant quest to become a
better athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Most players get to the pros because they are great athletes,
but many fall into a rut, just getting through the practices and
the games. They become stagnant.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown does more than a little extra. He is constantly
working, even up until game time.
</P>
<P>
   Brown gives much credit to Patriots running coach Michael
Morris, who has added speed, power, and confidence to his game.
When Brown catches a pass and seems to be moving even when people
are trying to bring him down, it's the result of work he's done to
improve his leg strength through proper running technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike's a track guy, so I could never be on his level, but he's
been good for me,'' said Brown. ``I feel more explosive and a
little quicker when I'm coming out of my breaks. Sometimes I don't
feel like I am explosive, but you really are and that's because of
the work I've done with Mike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyway, it's embarrassing to go down when only one guy is
trying to make the tackle. I'm always trying to fall forward for an
extra yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the game against the Colts started last Sunday
night, Brown was drenched with sweat as he and Morris went through
their drills.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of that stuff prepares me to play in the game,'' said
Brown. ``It helps my quickness as a punt returner when I have to
catch the ball cleanly and quickly and make that first quick move
upfield. It helps me as a receiver when I'm catching the ball and
then have to make that sudden cut to get more yardage.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris has been one of the Patriots' best hires in the past two
years. The younger brother of former New York Giants great Joe
Morris, he and Brown clicked immediately when Brown wanted to get
every advantage available to him. He worked on his strength and
agility with strength coach Johnny Parker and on his running with
Morris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Troy is a great football player,'' said Morris. ``The work
Johnny has done with him has made him much more flexible and he's
learned balance. Those plays when he gets hit and still seems to
keep going, those are a result of his excellent balance of being
able to get back on his feet and use his high knee technique to
keep himself going.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris said most players he works with incorporate parts of this
program into their game; Brown uses everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's put in a lot of time with my program,'' said Morris.
``He's been with it since I started working with the Patriots.
``Technically and fundamentally, he's very sound. The more he
continues to do it, the sounder he'll be.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris said there's no question that Brown is faster than he was
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Troy has always had this stigma that he's not that fast,''
said Morris. ``I've told him, `Troy, you're faster than you think.'
There are going to be days when he doesn't feel he's that fast, but
the people around him, like those who are trying to cover him, are
going to find out that he is.''
</P>
<P>
   An example of that speed was the Chicago game last season, when
Brown caught six passes for 124 yards. On a 52-yard reception in
the second quarter, Brown split two converging defenders and beat
them to the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done everything I've asked him to do, and the results are
there,'' said Morris. &QL; 
 &QL; 
A nice change
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What everyone seems to like about Brown is not only his hard
work and dedication, but the fact that he's a good guy. While some
players duck the media, the fans, their coaches, and the world
around them, Brown seems to embrace everything.
</P>
<P>
   As Patriots management keeps searching for good role models and
people to send into the community as their representative, Brown
becomes more valuable every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's now in great demand for endorsement opportunities,'' said
George. ``He's done some things for Coca-Cola, I know, and there
are many opportunities that come across my desk now.''
</P>
<P>
   But the best part for Brown is that he's finally being
recognized as more than a role player. Parcells always liked Brown,
but envisioned him as a good extra receiver. Brown never agreed
with that, and he has been allowed to flourish under Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very humbling experience for me,'' said Brown. ``I'm
not an angry, cocky, bitter guy because of it. I've been through
everything and now I can stand up and be a big part of things. I
never had anyone to tell me how it's done. I wish I had the
opportunity to teach that to other players. When I got here, we had
Michael Timpson and that was it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I've gone through has just made me enjoy this more. Being
in the NFL is a special gift. I'll never take it for granted.''

SALES SET TO RISE IN ORLANDO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seven months after injury ended her spectacular career at the
University of Connecticut, Nykesha Sales is going to Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly, but Tuesday the three-time All-American did
became the first player assigned to the new WNBA franchise in sunny
Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited to finally be officially a part of a team,''
said Sales, the 6-foot guard/forward who signed with the league in
late April but missed the entire season while rehabilitating her
right Achilles' tendon, torn during a game Feb. 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating at first,'' she said, to have technically
fulfilled her dream of playing professional basketball yet
physically be unable to do so. ``But it sort of came under
composure after a few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA also announced that Kristin Folkl, who like Sales sat
out the season with an injury, has been assigned to the expansion
franchise in Minneapolis. Folkl, who starred in both volleyball and
basketball during her four years at Stanford, said Tuesday that she
is 80 percent recovered from a torn anterior cruciate ligament and
is about a month away from getting back on a court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first feeling was probably fear, wondering if anybody was
even going to pick me up,'' she said Tuesday of her injury. ``Now
that I'm assigned to a team, I feel like I have something a little
more tangible to hold on to.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales, meanwhile, said she's ``just about 100 percent'' and will
play on the WNBA's tour in Brazil that begins Sept. 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good when I'm out there,'' said the 22-year-old of her
return to the hardcourt after months of rehabilitation in the
trainer's room at UConn. ``And my confidence is back. That was an
issue when I first started out, because we were starting all
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Carolyn Peck, who comes to the yet-to-be-named Orlando
franchise off a 23-10, Elite Eight season at Purdue, was thrilled
with her first pro acquisition. ``Nykesha is a phenomenal player
and fabulous person,'' she said. ``She knows how to win.''
</P>
<P>
   That she does, having played on UConn teams that went 135-7 and
won national championships during her four years in Storrs. But
Sales shrugged off concerns about how she would cope if Orlando did
poorly _ something the expansion Washington Mystics (3-27)
certainly did last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens to every player once in a while,'' she said. ``I'm
not anticipating that, but if it does happen it's nothing to get
discouraged about. I know it's a new program and we have to
build.''
</P>
<P>
   Known for her stealth and scoring outbursts, Sales had 447
steals (3.3 per game) during her four years at UConn, sixth
all-time on the NCAA Division 1 list, and she holds the school's
single-game scoring rec-ord of 46 points _ set against Folkl's
Stanford team last December. As a senior, she averaged 20.9 points,
5.7 rebounds, 3.3 steals, and 2.9 assists per game, shooting 57
percent from the floor, 38 percent from 3-point range, and 79
percent from the free throw line.
</P>
<P>
   But outside Storrs, Sales is probably, and many would say
unfairly, best known for the furor that erupted after she set the
UConn school scoring record of 2,178 points when, at the behest of
coach Geno Auriemma, she hobbled onto the court during last
season's final regular-season game to score a staged layup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew this one was coming,'' sighed Sales before patiently
answering a question about the controversy during Tuesday's
telephone conference. ``It's old now. It's finally died down, and
I'm just trying to keep it that way.''

AT AGE 42 SHE'S ON TOP OF HER GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; This is not the story of a child prodigy tennis player. It's
not about a kid who picked up a racket at the age 5 and started
swatting her way to Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   Just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Freeman-Young, a 42-year-old college teacher and
mother of two, first picked up a racket when she was 23. And even
though the Grand Slam tournaments have passed her by, Freeman-Young
has kept pace with her age group and is now ranked No. 4 in the
country in the women's 40 division.
</P>
<P>
   She leaves for England Thursday to be on a team of four
Americans competing at the International Federation Young Cup.
Twelve countries will play in the round-robin contest that is
similar to the Davis Cup.
</P>
<P>
   And since Freeman-Young does have a life off the tennis court,
the next 24 hours will be filled with more than just practicing her
serves and backhands. First she'll have to get the family packed
for the week-long trip, then she'll teach her class in sports
pyschology at Bentley College, in Waltham, Mass., Thursday morning,
then it's off to the airport in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman-Young didn't grow up playing tennis, although she grew
up being athletic and competitive. But her first choice of sport
was figure skating. Her skill on the ice, in fact, took her to be
ranked No. 8 in the US in 1976, and then being chosen for a
national touring show headed by Canadian skater Toller Cranston for
two years.
</P>
<P>
   That's when she said enough was enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been skating eight hours a day and was burnt out,'' she
said. ``I wanted to go to school and be normal.''
</P>
<P>
   She re-enrolled at Boston University, where she had been a
student before going on tour and was ``a normal person for two
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was bouncing off the walls because I was so used to
exercise,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So with one eye watching the rise of Chris Evert's career, and
the other on the tennis courts at her apartment complex,
Freeman-Young decided to give tennis a try.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought one of those wooden Chris Evert rackets, and would
watch her on TV, and say, `I think I can do that.'''
</P>
<P>
   She was right.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Freeman-Young went on to get married, have two
children, and get both her master's and doctorate degrees from BU
in psychology, tennis became the underlining theme. (She played
through both her pregnancies, including both days that she went
into labor.)
</P>
<P>
   In the past four years, Freeman-Young is undefeated in every
senior tournament (age 35 and up) in New England she has entered.
In fact, she hasn't lost a match. She also plays open tournaments
that include all age divisions, ``just to get good competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the three goals she set for herself, Freeman-Young is two
thirds of the way there. Her first goal was to win the national
indoor championship _ she did that two years ago in Chicago. Her
second goal was to compete with the US team at Young Cup in
England. She's on her way there. Her final goal is to be ranked No.
1 nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Will it happen? Her coach thinks so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably in another year or two,'' said Mike Daly, between
practice rounds at the Weymouth (Mass.) Club. ``In tennis, you get
better as you get older, and you can keep going because of
experience or new shots. So until your body gives out, your mind
gets smarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly, who has been coaching Freeman-Young for three years, said
he's been trying reduce her training time ``so she doesn't
overtrain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's counterproductive,'' he said. ``Your body winds down.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's not necessarily adding to her reportoire of strokes,
but enhancing the ones she already has.
</P>
<P>
   He's having her snap her wrist more on her serve to make it
faster and more accurate. He shows her how to raise her right elbow
more (``like Pete Sampras or Ivan Lendl'') on the forearm to give
her more speed. And while he has no complaints about her other
stroke (``her backhand is her strength''), Daly spends two hours on
the court peppering her with balls non-stop and drilling her on
both strokes and running moves.
</P>
<P>
   Which is fine with Freeman-Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the biggest thing we've done the past three years is
prepare me with lots of repetition,'' she said. ``We do it like you
wouldn't believe, hours and hours and hours of the same thing over
and over.''
</P>
<P>
   That, she said, is the secret behind her domination of the
senior circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``My best win ever was a couple years in Chicago,'' she said,
when the match lasted four hours. ``My opponent had the weapons,
but I had the endurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a sports psychologist doesn't hurt either.
</P>
<P>
   When the going gets tough, Freeman has a bag of tricks to pull
out _ things she espouses in her classroom.
</P>
<P>
   One is not to be so afraid of losing that it defeats you.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're feeling the fear of losing, you have to stay with
it, stay stable,'' she said. In other words, not to get so mad that
you lose your goal of winning.
</P>
<P>
   Another is not to get mad at your opponent or the linesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get angry, your adrenaline levels get way too high
and your coordination gets thrown off,'' she said. ``But people go
to that because it feels better than the fear. It's an easy out.''
</P>
<P>
   She also teaches _ and uses _ self-hypnosis (``it's really just
a very focused state of mind'') and attribution, or what athletes
attribute their win or loss to.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people say they lost because of the wind, or the sun,
they're not taking responsibility for their own destiny, and that's
trouble,'' Freeman-Young said. ``(Larry) Bird would just say, `I
had the shot, I missed.' It's personal responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Freeman-Young seems to have her psyche and strokes
under control, her biggest challenge might be following Daly's
orders and avoid overtraining.
</P>
<P>
   But she acknowledges that might be tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course my kids (Bryan and Kathryn) are my priority,'' said
Freeman-Young. ``But I love tennis, I can't tell you how much I
love it. I could do it all day.''

THE SLEAZY STARR CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So all the news is no longer fit to print? No problem; we'll
print it anyway. We haven't hit bottom yet in this Clinton
business. There's no bottom, in terms of Congress dillying and the
media dallying.
</P>
<P>
   But the people seem to have found their feet. Or the masses
never lost their footing, is more like it. Don't absolve him, don't
impeach him; get him straightened out on how to deal with females
in his private world; and get him back on the job, without worrying
about some 10-night-stand customer blackmailing him for a job.
</P>
<P>
   When I heard Mario Cuomo telling Larry King that we need to find
a way to punish the president without punishing the country, I
thought: Aha! Just right. That's what leadership is; putting into
words what a majority of the folks will settle upon as eventually
the right thing to do. Thank you, Mario.
</P>
<P>
   So censure is where I come out. You can forget about
resignation. Clinton may be a foolhardy chap who can't think
straight in the femme department. But he'll not hand himself over,
naked to his enemies. So all the keyboard-pounders and Republican
partisans pushing the time-to-resign-Bill button are kidding
themselves. Never happen. ``Hillary would kill him,'' opines a
fellow who knows them both.
</P>
<P>
   The collateral damage just won't quit. Kenneth Starr shot his
wad with this politically inspired impeachment paper. It is, in
terms of Whitewater, Mt. Molehill. A pyramid of prurience, to be
sure; the dress, the cigar, the icky phone stuff. Ugh! But four
years? And $40 million? And all those hundreds of FBI agents? And
dozens of lawyers? For a steamy manure pile of lowbrow sexual
mores? Is that all there is?
</P>
<P>
   Does the Get-Clinton Lobby, which used to be the Whitewater
Lobby, and included spinoffs such as the Filegate crowd, the Vince
Foster-gate mob, the Travel-gate posse, really melt away like
Monica's mash notes? Whitewater went poof! But nobody noticed
because we're all talking about you-know-what.
</P>
<P>
   The public is disgusted and furious over the way the government
is paralyzed as the world economy spins out of control. None of the
juicy stuff Starr's hound dogs chased down on the president was
saved for the final draft; it was all leaked in advance, which
tells you where the leaks were coming from. The leaking is damning
testimony to the partisan nature of the probe.Despite all the
Republican posturing, Starr's campaign to get Clinton was a bag job
from start to finish. The polls show the public was not fooled.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment drive will peter out shortly after the
congressional elections, is my guess. The GOP will milk the Clinton
scandal for what it's worth, and probably pick up extra seats,
unless the right wingers get so over-zealous that voters decide to
forgive Clinton a little faster than they otherwise would. The
public's anger is palpable. And the Sun Belt mujahideen who
dominate the Congress usually go overboard. Remember the government
shutdown?
</P>
<P>
   There will not be much public patience here with any kind of ``a
crawling coup d'etat'' against Clinton, in the telling phrase
employed by a Russian minister describing attempts to unhorse
Yeltsin. Clinton would turn impeachment into a street fight. And
this Congress is more bark than bite in taking on issues where
public opinion is clear. The stock market rally anticipated the
public's verdict, once the salacious details were absorbed: Starr's
report is thin soup from which to concoct impeachment stew.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is a prevaricator, who denies his hand is in the cookie
jar even as he squeezes the chocolate chips. But you don't impeach
the leader of the free world because he said ``I never had sexual
relations with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky,'' instead of ``I never had
sexual intercourse with ...'' The perjury and obstruction of
justice charges are chump change when measured against the volleys
of accusations hurled at the Clintons in the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   What about Whitewater, Mr. Starr? What about Filegate,
Travelgate, Vince Fostergate, and all the other trumped-up scandals
woven into fantastic conspiracy theories by the Wall Street Journal
editorial writers?
</P>
<P>
   For years the ideological warriors who flogged Clinton from that
journalistic redoubt have sold packages of anti-Clinton propaganda.
But Starr must not have been a customer for the Journal's nutty
conspiracy theories, even though it has been Starr's chief media
cook and bottle-washer for four long years.
</P>
<P>
   The collateral damage in this Clinton business is considerable,
and the damage to the Journal's reputation is growing. So how come
Starr didn't do anything with all that guff about Whitewater, and
the ancillary-gates? I can't hear you, World's Most Important
Publication. And I can't hear you either, Rush Limbaugh, Gordon
Liddy, Oliver North. What gives?
</P>
<P>
   The silence of the Clinton-haters on these points is all the
proof you need. The get-Clinton campaign has always been about
politics. From gays in the military to Hillary's failed bid to get
health insurance for 40 million uninsured, it was always about
politics, and trying to undo the verdict of two elections.

<P>
   The turning point in the adultery code came at a press
conference on May 6, 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Herald had staked out the Washington townhouse of
former Sen. Gary Hart, a leading Democratic presidential candidate,
and reported that it appeared he had spent the night with a woman
who was not his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Hart had been dogged by whispers of womanizing, but he had not
been terribly indiscreet and _ after the Herald went public with
its revelation _ his wife stood by him and accepted his pleas of
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all honesty, if it doesn't bother me, I don't think it
ought to bother anyone else,'' Lee Hart told the press.
</P>
<P>
   Under the old rules, that would have been all. But this time the
press would not drop the story. In The New Republic, then-editor
Michael Kinsley crowed: ``We are witnessing the breakdown, at long
last, of an anti-democratic conspiracy among the Washington elite
of journalists and politicians to keep information from voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart withdrew from the race. But before that, something more
important happened. At that press conference, Paul Taylor of The
Washington Post asked The Question. ``Have you ever committed
adultery?''
</P>
<P>
   That word ``ever'' obliterated the old rules. It declared that
any act of infidelity, never mind how discreet, was part of the
public picture for a public figure. The door was blown off the
closet, at least for politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Hart, understandably baffled, stammered that he did not have to
answer the question _ the right answer, at least by the old rules,
although it did not save him.
</P>
<P>
   If what might be called a decent hypocrisy as to adultery no
longer affords protection to a man or woman, then what rules are we
playing by?
</P>
<P>
   Narrowing the band of possible behavior from, say, ``Be
discreet'' to ``Do nothing that might ever start a rumor'' _
because rumors will be investigated _ is unlikely to give us a
higher standard of morality among politicians and public figures.
(In any case saints make lousy leaders.)
</P>
<P>
   It is more likely that adultery will be flushed out into the
open more often. The closet will shrink or even disappear. What
then? Either exposed adulterers will be steadfastly condemned and
disgraced, even (sometimes) against common sense and the wishes of
the betrayed spouse. Or people will retreat from condemning so
human a sin and will decide to relax about it instead.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate these options, consider two fairly obvious
examples of figures caught up in high-profile adultery stories:
Kelly Flinn and Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the U.S. Air Force's Lt. Flinn, the first woman to
pilot a B-52, was threatened with court martial and forced out of
the service after authorities learned that she had been conducting
an affair with a civilian who was married (Flinn was single) to an
enlisted woman who served on Flinn's base.
</P>
<P>
   The armed services' rules against adultery used to be enforced
in the usual hypocritical way (wink wink). But there were good
reasons for punishing Flinn: She had lied to her superiors; she had
disobeyed an order to change her conduct; she had threatened morale
and order by her interference in the marriage of an enlisted
colleague.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision to punish Flinn raised important questions.
What does consentual adultery have to do with flying a plane?
Should a bit of hanky-panky destroy a career into which the
government had put a great deal of energy and money?
</P>
<P>
   The military found itself in an absurd position. Without the
protection of hypocrisy they faced the possibility of a decimated
officer corps. The Flinn case led to the case of Army Maj. Gen.
John Longhouser who, despite a long and distinguished career, was
forced to retire after a telephone tip revealed that he had carried
on an affair while separated from his wife, five years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Gen. Joseph Ralston, vice chairman of the joint chiefs of
staff, was disqualified for the top job after it emerged that he
had carried on an affair 13 years earlier, although he too had been
separated from his wife at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate for a policy that was both consistent and committed,
the hapless generals set up a sexual misconduct hotline. But in the
wake of the Flinn affair, reports of adultery came in so thick and
fast that the Army shut down the hotline.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officers expressed concern that minor transgressions were
ending the careers of distinguished officers. The story confirmed
what we already knew: no public, legalistic system of anti-adultery
rules can work.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the second alternative to hypocrisy is the one it seems _
at least in view of current post-Starr-report Clinton popularity
polls _ we're going to adopt: airing adultery in public and
shrugging about it.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Bill Clinton. This gnawing case shows that what is
happening now is the reverse of what ought to happen: adultery is
being condemned legally and excused morally.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, when Gennifer Flowers went public with allegations that
Gov. Clinton had carried on an affair with her, this was rightly
seen as reflecting on the character and veracity of a presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Next thing we knew, Clinton was on television, with Hillary
Clinton at his side, doing what honesty demanded: confessing to
problems in their marriage, and that he'd admitted wrongdoing, and
showing they had patched it up and asked for the people's
forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The people gave it _ as they should have done, in the
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   But step back, and what you see is this: In 1987 a bright young
presidential candidate got caught with his pants down and was
forced out of the race; in 1992 another bright young presidential
candidate got caught with his pants down and was elected president.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, in 1992 the public, probably for the first time,
decided that it could live with an acknowledged adulterer as
president.
</P>
<P>
   What makes for uneasiness is not the adultery but the
combination of open inquiry, open acknowledgement and open
indifference. Thus, by the time Monica Lewinsky entered the
picture, Clinton had all but dropped the pretense of marital
fidelity, and the public had all but dropped the pretense of
caring.
</P>
<P>
   This made the aftermath of events all the more perverse. As part
of an officially unrelated investigation into sexual harassment,
Clinton was asked under oath whether he had had sex with Lewinsky.
He denied it.
</P>
<P>
   When Lewinsky was taped, saying she and the president had had an
affair and that, with the White House's encouragement, she lied
about it, the matter became one of perjury: a federal crime.
</P>
<P>
   On national television in 1992, during the Flowers affair,
Clinton had been asked The Question. Could he say that he had never
committed adultery? He replied: ``I'm not prepared tonight to say
that any married couple should ever discuss that with anybody but
themselves.'' Translate: don't make me lie.
</P>
<P>
   That was the right answer; it had been for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   By now, in 1998, the law gives no quarter to tradition; a
self-propelled legal process makes the traditional answer not just
hypocritical but illegal. The lawyers were going to ask and the
president would have to tell _ never mind that he, his wife and his
mistress all had agreed, for the protection of his presidency and
of their own families, to bury the affair.
</P>
<P>
   The end result is the worst of all possible worlds. Lying about
adultery, even in the interests of all concerned, has been made
effectively illegal.
</P>
<P>
   When the adulterer's closet becomes a zone of legal peril,
adulterers will simply abandon it and take their chances with
openness. According to a Newsweek poll, adultery is already at the
bottom of the list of reasons for voting against a presidential
candidate. As people get used to hearing about this or that
prominent person's infidelities _ a U.S. president here, a British
foreign secretary there _ the taboo evaporates.
</P>
<P>
   I don't doubt that honesty has its good points. And yet, as with
illegitimacy, abortion and dependency, we have found that there is
a price for destigmatizing behaviours which should be discouraged
but are not illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Today most people in the United States agree that adultery is
wrong, and only a few admit to engaging in it: Fewer than one in
four men, and about half as many women, report ever having been
unfaithful. Of course, people lie about adultery, so those figures
should be taken as lower bounds. But that is the point.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a society in which, say, 50 or 75 percent of adults
cheerfully admit to infidelity; people take adultery for granted; a
wife's threat to go public or a boss' threat to be shocked ceases
to be much of a deterrent, and it becomes harder to tell children,
with a straight face, that cheating is really, truly, wrong _ which
is still a fairly useful thing to be able to say.
</P>
<P>
   But a better rule than saying ``Who cares?'' _ effectively
shrugging at adultery _ is: If the adulterer takes all reasonable
steps to be discreet, if he (or she) performs his (or her) duties
as parent, spouse and citizen, and if his (or her) spouse chooses
to hang on, then nothing has happened. This is not covering up; it
is being grown-up.

 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 NOTE: Full-length article (8,600 words) available on request  
 &HT;    George Walker Bush was visiting his parents in the White House
one day when the talk turned to religion, which is precisely the
subject that some powerful factions in the Republican Party want
their presidential standard-bearer to talk about, forcefully, in
2000.
 &HT;    But Bush, sitting one day recently on a sofa in the governor's
office at the Texas State Capitol, says he is ``cautious about
wearing my religion on my sleeve in the political process.'' And he
offers this particular story to explain why.
 &HT;    ``Mother and I were arguing _ not arguing, having a discussion _
and discussing who goes to Heaven,'' recalls the governor, who at
the time had religion very much on his mind.
 &HT;    Having dealt with a gathering drinking problem by abruptly
swearing off alcohol, he had vowed a renewed commitment to his
family and his faith. Bush pointed to the Bible: Only Christians
had a place in heaven.
 &HT;    ``I said, Mom, look, all I can tell you is what the New
Testament says. And she said, well, surely, God will accept others.
And I said, Mom, here's what the New Testament says. And she said,
OK, and she picks up the phone and calls Billy Graham. She says to
the White House operator, Get me Billy Graham.
 &HT;    ``I said, Mother, what are you doing?'' Bush continues,
chuckling at the memory. ``Seriously. And about two minutes later,
the phone rings, and it's Billy Graham, and Mother and I are on the
phone with Billy. And Mother explains the circumstances, and Billy
says, From a personal perspective, I agree with what George is
saying, the New Testament has been my guide. But I want to caution
you both. Don't play God. Who are you two to be God?''
 &HT;    For George W. Bush, a man who, in large part because of his
famous name, shows up in most polls these days as the very early
front-runner for a Republican presidential nomination battle that
is still more than a year away, it is an interesting story to
choose to relate.
 &HT;    Bush says it explains in part why he urged an end to ``name
calling'' this summer when a fracas broke out over his party's
decision to bar a gay Republican group from setting up a booth at
the GOP state convention.
 &HT;    ``There are some great admonitions in the Bible, talking about,
you know, don't try to take the speck out of your neighbor's eye
when you've got a log in your own,'' Bush says. ``I'm mindful of
that.''
 &HT;    And in his nearly four years as governor of the nation's
second-largest state, there has been strikingly little name-calling
from Bush. He talks constantly about being a ``unifier, not a
divider,'' and few things seem to make him happier than forging a
bipartisan consensus on some big bill.
 &HT;    He has grown so close to some Democratic lawmakers that he once
said there was ``no way in the world'' he could bring himself to
campaign against them.
 &HT;    Running now for his own re-election, Bush campaigns ferociously
in Democratic strongholds such as El Paso, where he breaks into
near-fluent Spanish before a delighted crowd at a ''Viva Bush!''
rally and where the Democratic mayor, Carlos Ramirez, introduces
him as ``the best governor of Texas that El Paso has ever had.''
 &HT;    For these and many other reasons, the 52-year-old eldest son of
former President George Bush is riding a broad wave of popularity
that, if current polls hold true, will carry him to a sweeping
victory this November as the first governor re-elected in Texas in
24 years, the first ever elected to back-to-back four-year terms.
 &HT;    Already, more than 100 Democratic officeholders have endorsed
him, including the state's lieutenant governor, a gruff political
veteran named Bob Bullock, who announced his support for Bush's
re-election even though he is godfather to the daughter of Bush's
Democratic opponent, Garry Mauro, the state land commissioner.
 &HT;    But if all this bodes well for Bush's re-election prospects in
Texas, and arguably for his prospects as a national candidate in a
general election, it also raises some obvious and perhaps
treacherous questions for the governor.
 &HT;    These are questions he would surely find tossed at him by
primary opponents if, in a step he is widely expected to take, he
runs for his father's old job. Just why do all those Democrats like
him so much? What kind of a Republican is he?
 &HT;    Why, for example, have some of his fiercest battles been with
his fellow Republicans? Some, including the state chairman of his
party at the time, are still furious with the governor over a tax
proposal he devised that would have radically reshaped the state
tax system, providing more money for some of the poorest public
schools in part by slapping new taxes on some of the biggest
industries.
 &HT;    Reticent on abortion, disinclined to denounce homosexuals, a
self-described fiscal conservative who is willing to spend money on
new programs such as a huge public-school reading initiative, Bush
does not seem to be offering the orthodoxy that some Republican
conservatives insist will be necessary in the party's candidate in
2000.
 &HT;    For all the speculation right now over whether Bush will want to
run for president _ speculation that has only seemed to grow more
fevered as scandal engulfs President Bill Clinton and threatens
Vice President Al Gore, the Democrat with the most obvious
presidential ambitions _ the more intriguing question may in time
turn out to be whether today's Republican Party wants someone like
Bush as its nominee.
 &HT;    Many party foot soldiers, still angry over the way they feel the
1996 nominee, Bob Dole, essentially ignored abortion, school prayer
and other issues they care most about, are determined to find a
candidate who will carry the torch _ or else. Many use Dole's name
as a verb, and not in a nice way _ ``We won't get Doled again,''
they say.
 &HT;    Bush insists that he is a cultural conservative and promotes
what he calls ``the responsibility era.'' But candidates are
already lining up to his right, including the deep-pocketed Steve
Forbes, the flat-tax fanatic of 1996 who this time around is making
an all-out pitch to social conservatives.
 &HT;    Forbes describes a ban on the procedure known as partial-birth
abortion as his foremost priority, ``the first step toward putting
abortion on the road to ultimate extinction in the United States of
America.''
 &HT;    Bush describes himself as ``pro-life,'' supports the
partial-birth abortion ban and pledges to propose a bill next year
requiring parental consent for a minor's abortion _ ``issues over
which we can make a difference,'' he says.
 &HT;    But on the basic question of the right of most women in most
circumstances to obtain an abortion, his position is that the
Supreme Court has already settled the law. And, to date, he has not
pledged any kind of crusade to sweep away those rulings; whether he
might do so in the heat of a primary campaign remains an open
question.
 &HT;    The Bush balancing act will be infinitely tougher to sustain in
the glare of the national stage. And how odd it seems, at least to
some, that so many Republicans might look to a man named George
Bush as their savior, given that George Bush lost it all for the
party just six years ago.
 -0- 
 &HT;    President Bush was at a steakhouse in Council Bluffs, Iowa, one
October day in 1994, reminiscing with some supporters from the old
days, when he excused himself to take a cellular telephone call.
The father was intently following the progress of two of his sons,
George and Jeb, in their respective gubernatorial campaigns against
savvy Democratic veterans in Texas and Florida, and new poll
numbers were just in.
 &HT;    ``He came back and he said, It looks like Jeb's OK, but I'm
worried about George,'' recalled Gordon C. James, a member of the
White House advance team in the Bush administration. ``He was upset
about it.''
 &HT;    Both races looked close, but like a lot of people, the president
saw evidence that Jeb (a nickname John Ellis Bush takes from his
initials) would pull it out over Lawton Chiles and that George's
race against a popular incumbent, Ann W. Richards, was just too
uphill a fight.
 &HT;    As things turned out, though, some invisible law of political
primogeniture seemed to kick in _ the older brother won and the
younger did not. (Late this summer, however, while George W. is
cruising toward re-election, Jeb is, according to the polls,
comfortably ahead too in his second bid for the governor's Mansion
in Tallahassee.)
 &HT;    Back in 1994, in seeing the softer-spoken, genial Jeb as the
more likely success in politics, people in the Bush family were
relying on much more than polling data. It's not that George W.
wasn't as determined to win as any Bush.
 &HT;    ``I think the major word to describe George W. circa 1993 and
the governorship was competitiveness,'' said Chase Untermeyer, a
longtime family friend and former presidential personnel director.
(Asked to compare George W. and his father in this regard,
Untermeyer said with a laugh: ``It is such a competitive family,
it's hard to make those shadings there. That's a driven
situation.'')
 &HT;    But if George W. Bush was driven, he was also known for a sharp
tongue and temper _ the ``Roman candle of the family ... and
likeliest to burn the fingers,'' as he is aptly described in
Richard Ben Cramer's ``What It Takes,'' the exhaustive account of
the 1988 presidential campaign.
 &HT;    When the Queen of England came to a White House dinner, Barbara
Bush sat George W. at the other end of the table, just to make sure
he didn't say anything undiplomatic to Her Majesty. He was the pit
bull brought in to deliver the bad news to the president's pit bull
of a chief of staff, John Sununu, when it was time for Sununu to
leave the White House.
 &HT;    And Bush, an unpaid adviser to his father, quarreled with
reporters during the 1992 campaign, frequently accusing them of
having a bias against the president.
 &HT;    Even Bush doesn't bother to deny that he was brusque in those
days.
 &HT;    ``I love my Dad, and it should not surprise you that I was a
fierce warrior on his behalf,'' he said, as his campaign plane
rumbled over the central Texas prairie one day this spring. ``And
if that ruffled people's feathers, so be it. There's a big
difference between being the son of a candidate and being the
candidate. And I understand the difference.''
 &HT;    And certainly, there was a difference by the time George W.
began his campaign for governor in 1994, a bid he contemplated four
years earlier but passed up, in part over concerns that running
with his father in the White House might look too opportunistic _
and be too embarrassing to all the Bushes if he lost.
 &HT;    Running against Ann W. Richards, the feisty and sharp-witted
incumbent who once famously derided his father as ``poor old
George,'' born with a ``silver foot in his mouth,'' Bush would seem
to have had ample reason to lose his cool.
 &HT;    In the course of the campaign, Richards called him ``Shrub,''
``that young Bush boy'' and ''some jerk,'' and joked that he was
``missing his Herbert'' (a reference to his father's two middle
names).
 &HT;    Richards frequently said that if Bush's name were George Walker,
without the Bush, no one would even take his campaign seriously _ a
point not without merit.
 &HT;    All the barbs and his prior reputation notwithstanding, Bush
turned in a truly remarkable performance. He did not lose his cool
at all, and at times he laughed right along with Richards,
basically telling voters that she sure was a funny lady, whom
everybody enjoyed, but that he came from a party and held to a
conservative philosophy that were more in line with what Texans
wanted in government. (Not that Bush wasn't out for revenge: As he
explained at the time, his strategy was to ``kill her with
kindness.'')
 &HT;    And for a man who had seemingly wandered through much of his 20s
and 30s, and who conceded that the main question surrounding him
was, ``What's the boy ever done?'' he ran a thoroughly disciplined
campaign.
 &HT;    Mindful that his father had lacked a coherent message in 1992,
Bush offered voters a precise, four-point plan for better
government: more control for local school districts, stricter
provisions for welfare recipients, tougher juvenile-justice laws
and reform of the state's tort laws. He never deviated from the
message. And while hardly the most scintillating set of political
themes ever developed, it allowed him to sidestep other issues,
particularly abortion.
 &HT;    Bush says the only painful episode from the campaign was a brief
flap over an interview he gave an Austin reporter about religion,
in which he reiterated his own personal belief that the path to
Heaven leads through acceptance of Christ as one's personal savior.
 &HT;    ``It was, of course, picked up and politicized _ you know, 'Bush
to Jews: Go to Hell,''' he recalls. ``It was very ugly. It hurt my
feelings.''
 &HT;    On election night, buoyed by the Republican surge that led to
the takeover of Congress, Bush won going away, 54 percent to 46
percent.
 &HT;    Jeb Bush, meanwhile, ran a campaign with a much sharper
conservative edge, speaking out against abortion and selecting a
Christian Coalition ``legislator of the year'' as his running mate.
To someone who briefly watched him campaign in 1994, the difference
this year is striking. He seems to have taken a page from his
brother, offering a much more upbeat message, reaching out to
minority groups, emphasizing education and greater ``compassion''
in state services.
 &HT;    Taking a break from a sweltering day of campaigning this summer
in West Palm Beach, Jeb Bush let out a tight laugh as he gave
credit to his big brother for proving himself ``the better
politician.''
 &HT;    ``He ran on four or five items or whatever it was, and he stayed
focused on that,'' Bush said. ``And that is a great lesson in
politics.''
 &HT;    Jeb Bush said he speaks to his brother about running for the
White House only ``in the contingent, in the conditional,'' but
adds that he has no doubt that his brother has ``the right stuff''
to be president.
 &HT;    And what if anyone tries to run to George W.'s right, by
emphasizing abortion or other specific social issues?
 &HT;    ``I think they'll fail,'' Jeb Bush said, ``because the broader
moral questions are the ones that concern the great majority of
people out there that fit this criteria of 'cultural
conservatives.' It is so sterile to talk about the things that the
press in this state wants to try to create, or my opponent.
Basically the same thing. There's all this Christian right, and
abortion. These are not the issues that drive people's concerns.
They want to know, how do they get the support to make sure their
children don't take drugs. They want their schools to be safe.
 &HT;    ``I'm very confident,'' he added, ``that George Bush will be
very successful if he stays the course with his message.''

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    George W. Bush, the governor of Texas, likes to say that the
fundamental difference between him and his father is that the
former president attended Greenwich Country Day School, while he
went to San Jacinto Junior High School in Midland, Texas.
 &HT;    Born in 1946 in New Haven, George and Barbara Bush's first
child, young ``Georgie'' was along for the famous journey when his
father struck out for West Texas in a 1947 Studebaker.
 &HT;    He was a mischievous boy with a passion for sports, especially
baseball, and a penchant for wisecracks that may well have its
origins in a family tragedy. George was 7 years old when his
sister, Robin, 3, died of leukemia, and both of his parents told
friends that George seemed to develop a joking, bantering style in
a determined bid to lift them from their grief. (There are five
Bush children, four sons and a surviving daughter.)
 &HT;    He did spend many formative years in Midland, and attended the
public schools there. But while his identity as a Texan has never
been mocked to the degree his father's was, the younger Bush has
preppy credentials that parallel those of his father. He went to
Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., and to Yale University. In
fact, much of Bush's life seems to be a slightly eerie, and not
always successful, bid to retrace the footsteps of the famous
father.
 &HT;    ``You have to really understand how much his father was loved
and respected by so many people to understand what it would be like
to grow up as a namesake, the son of George Bush, `` said George W.
Bush's first cousin, John Ellis, a Boston-based marketing and
advertising consultant who is close to the governor.
 &HT;    ``There are all these parallels in his life. 'He went to
Andover, went to Yale, went to West Texas, ran for Congress, and at
every stage of that he was found wanting. To go through every stage
of life and be found wanting and know that people find you wanting,
that's a real grind.''
 &HT;    To Bush's critics, his prolonged rowdy days and his
unspectacular early career make his later political success _ in
which simply having the name ``George Bush'' was undeniably a
crucial, perhaps THE crucial, element _ all the more irritating,
and undeserved. But in Ellis' view, his cousin's later
achievements, which came after his marriage and his decision to
quit drinking, are all the more impressive in light of the wayward
years.
 &HT;    ``He gathered it together,'' said Ellis. ``George was on the
road to nowhere at 40. At the age of 52, he's the front-runner for
the Republican presidential nomination. That's a pretty incredible
turnaround.''
 &HT;    Bush himself does not deny that he is a classic late bloomer; he
refers to the ``nomadic years'' of his youth and once explained he
``kind of floated and saw a lot of life'' throughout his 20s. He
even jokes about all this, though one wonders if the stand-up
monologue he delivered to a howling audience this past winter at
Washington's elite Alfalfa Club, with his father present, had just
a tinge of bitter truth to it.
 &HT;    ``Can you imagine how much it hurt,'' said George Walker Bush,
``to know that Dad's idea of the perfect son was'' _ and then he
paused before delivering the line that brought down the house _
``Al Gore?''
 &HT;    At Yale, just like his father, Bush was in the secretive Skull
and Bones club. He was president of his fraternity, Delta Kappa
Epsilon, though, as a less-than-diligent student, he did not follow
the old man into Phi Beta Kappa. In any event, he says he did not
like a lot of the ``intellectual arrogance'' and ''snobs'' at Yale,
and he cites one incident as particularly galling.
 &HT;    Several months after his father lost the 1964 Texas Senate
campaign to Ralph Yarborough, the incumbent Democratic populist,
Bush said he met Yale's prominent campus chaplain.
 &HT;    ``I ran into William Sloane Coffin, who was the preacher at
Yale, supposedly the guy that was there to comfort students,'' the
governor said. ``I introduced myself and he said, Yeah, I know your
father, and your father lost to a better man.''
 &HT;    Even today, 33 years later, Bush is clearly offended by the
statement, and it is one of the many reasons, he says, that he
couldn't wait to get back to Texas, after his graduation in 1968:
``Texas people are more polite. I don't think a Texan would do that
to a son.''
 &HT;    When Bush talks about his father, this is not the only trace of
bitterness. Victory in the Persian Gulf War, he told Texas Monthly,
was ``one of the great achievements of the 20th century, and it had
a shelf life of about a month.'' He is also still bothered, as he
later puts it in an interview, by the ``factors that caused this
good man to get defeated.''
 &HT;    And he raises at least one that could well resurface in some
fashion: ``Patrick J. Buchanan handing the baton, the proverbial
political knife, off to Ross Perot _ the kind of isolationism and
nativism and very harsh attacks against George Bush. You die a
death of a thousand cuts in the political process.''
 &HT;    George the younger obviously loves and reveres his father, and
he has plenty of characteristics _ the impish half-grin, the chop
in the air, the passion for foods that gross out some of his staff
(bologna sandwiches, in his case) _ that strikingly betray his
genes.
 &HT;    And yet, President Bush has been curiously absent from his son's
campaigns and oratory. Barbara Bush shows up much more often. One
of the governor's stock campaign jokes involves going to get his
hair cut, and having the barber marvel: ``I can't believe I'm
cutting the hair of the son of Barbara Bush.''
 &HT;    Partly, the governor simply wants to be seen as his own man _
not ``just another rich son of a Bush,'' as the Texas populist Jim
Hightower describes him. And for his part, the president ``almost
makes it a point not to advise him too much, on the theory that
people would say, 'Hey, you're just Daddy's boy,' `` said George
Strake, a former Republican state chairman in Texas and a Bush
family friend.
 &HT;    But there is clearly another undercurrent here. While President
Bush remains personally popular with Americans, any prominent role
in a national campaign could resurrect the ambivalence many
Republicans felt about him. And it could lead to questions about
just how his son differs from him politically, if at all.
 &HT;    Neither Bush nor his top aides will even take much of a stab at
that. (One, insisting he not be quoted by name, offered this
thought: ``I think the father was more of a noblesse oblige
politician, while George W. Bush is a conviction politician.''
Hardly a comparison to flatter the old man.)
 &HT;    President and Mrs. Bush declined requests for an interview for
this story. But a couple of weeks ago, a two-and-a-half-page letter
from Kennebunkport came whirring across my fax machine, a response
to a series of written questions.
 &HT;    In it, President Bush wrote of the ``enormous pride'' he felt as
he watched two of his sons make their way in public life. ``Both
Jeb and George were at my side in some pretty tough times,'' he
said, ``and they know firsthand what Teddy Roosevelt's `Arena' is
really like. I hope they never say, 'It's not worth it.'''
 &HT;    The former president said he was reluctant to speak out on
issues these days, ''because I don't want some reporter from
Washington rushing down to one of our sons after I stake out a
position on an issue saying: 'Your Dad says so and so. ... Why
don't you agree?'
 &HT;    ``I had my chance,'' Bush continued. ``Now it is their time and
I am determined to stay out of the way. To support them where they
want me to. But not to inadvertently cause complications for
them.''
 &HT;    George W. Bush knows that if he runs, everybody will be asking
questions about his relationship with his father. ``Doonesbury''
has already given the governor his cartoon identity: a junior-size
point of light. The governor says he's neither concerned nor
interested. ``These are the kind of psychological analyses that I'm
not really thrilled about talking about,'' he explains. ``It's not
my thing.
 &HT;    ``You occasionally read about, 'Well, he must prove himself''' _
the governor draws out the words with a theatrical flair _ ```to be
different from his father.' The voice is out of Washington, and the
Echo Chamber. `Well, he must distinguish himself''' _ more emphasis
_ ```from his father.' Well, therein lies the dilemma. But I don't
listen to them. Because all I've got to do is be myself.
 &HT;    ``By being myself I will distinguish myself from my father,
because we're two separately different people. I've got half my
mother in me and half my father in me, which is a pretty
interesting combination.''
 &HT;    When George W. got back to Texas in 1968, he joined the Texas
Air National Guard and for five years spent some weekends and
longer stints flying fighter jets. His unit was never called for
service in the Vietnam War, and by enlisting in the guard, he was
automatically removed as a candidate for the military draft, an
issue that flared briefly in the 1994 gubernatorial campaign and
undoubtedly would again in a national race.
 &HT;    In 1992, gearing up for his Texas campaign, Bush told The New
York Times that while he was prepared to serve, he had trouble
remembering what his position was on the war when he was in
college. While that may sound implausible, people who knew him at
the time said that Bush indeed showed virtually no interest in
public policy, or politics.
 &HT;    It seems inconceivable, for instance, that he could ever have
written anyone a letter brooding over how to ``maintain my
political viability within the system,'' to use the memorable
phrase from a 1969 letter sent by a young man named Bill Clinton,
born the month after George W. Bush, to the director of the
University of Arkansas' Reserve Officers Training Corps program.
 &HT;    What most seems to have marked the decade after Bush graduated
from college was his wandering, carousing nature. He held a series
of jobs, working on an offshore rig and (miserably) for an
agricultural firm, and mentoring inner-city youth in Houston.
 &HT;    But he was best known as a major-league partygoer, often seen
driving around town in his Triumph and in the company of attractive
young women.
 &HT;    As governor, Bush has clearly succeeded in drawing a rather huge
zone of privacy around the question of just how wild his wild days
were. He declines to answer specific questions about matters such
as drug use.
 &HT;    ``There were things I did that were mistakes,'' he said. ``But I
think inventorying mistakes is a mistake. I think they send wrong
signals. I think they undermine the message.
 &HT;    ``I'd be the first to admit that I did irresponsible things when
I was young and irresponsible,'' he continued. ``I've assumed the
mantle of being a governor and a father in a responsible way, and
the signal we ought to send to our children is that in spite of
what happened in the '60s and '70s, we have learned some lessons.
And the lesson ought to be, don't be using drugs and alcohol. Learn
the lessons from the past.''

 WILD YOUNG '60s GUY JUMPS INTO MARRIAGE, BUSINESS and POLITICS  
 &HT;     (This is Part III of a four-part series. It has already moved

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    There is something potentially incongruous about George W. Bush
as the self-described promoter of ``a responsibility era.'' As one
who seems to have indulged freely in his past, Bush now routinely
lectures high-schoolers to ``abstain from sex until you've found
the person you want to marry.''
 &HT;    And when Bush stepped ever so gingerly into the White House sex
scandal, saying recently he felt ``embarrassed for the country,''
Lanny J. Davis, a Clinton adviser, leapt in with a response. Noting
that he had been at Yale with Bush, Davis said on national
television that the governor ``shouldn't throw stones.''
 &HT;    On the other hand, Bush's message is reflective of the country
at large. He is, after all, just one of countless tens of thousands
of parents who came of age in the 1960s and are now saying much the
same thing to their kids.
 &HT;    In a generally laudatory piece about Bush's campaign for values
in this summer's edition of City Journal, a publication of the
conservative Manhattan Institute, Tucker Carlson suggested that
Bush may in fact be the perfect spokesman for ``the politics of
virtue.''
 &HT;    ``Before his marriage, Bush had a reputation (from all accounts,
deserved) as something of a wild man,'' Carlson wrote. ``When he
speaks, it is as a grizzled veteran of the sexual revolution. But
he is a changed man.''
 &HT;    In a two-and-a-half-page letter, with responses to a series of
questions I posed for this article, President Bush (he declined to
be interviewed) made a point of dismissing the notion that his son
ever seriously lost his way in any of these years.
 &HT;    ``I asked Barbara to read this letter,'' the president wrote.
``She asked me to add that, like me, she never felt George was a
problem _ that he never had trouble 'finding himself.' She
believes, as I do, that 'the wild young man' thesis is greatly
overblown.
 &HT;    ``George really never had trouble 'finding himself,''' Bush
added in the next paragraph. ``He had some happy times, but none of
this 'worried' Barbara and me. He never lost his bearing. He always
came home.''
 &HT;    In 1973, George W. Bush decided he wanted to become serious
about a business career, and he entered Harvard Business School.
Two years later, driving a 1970 Cutlass, he retraced a famous
journey to West Texas his father made in 1948, and headed back
south and west toward dusty Midland. True, given his family
contacts, this was hardly a journey into the great unknown.
 &HT;    Bush's plan was to jump into the oil business, but before long
he was jumping into other things as well: marriage and politics. In
1977, he married Laura Welch, a librarian and schoolteacher from
Midland who is, by wide agreement, a crucial influence in both the
governor's personal transformation and his political success.
 &HT;    With a down-to-earth style, an infectious sense of humor and
campaigns reminiscent of her mother-in-law's, for breast-cancer
awareness and literacy, she is wildly popular in Texas.
 &HT;    Having rarely even been in the area for a decade before his
return, Bush made a brash decision when the 44-year incumbent
Democratic congressman, George Mahon, announced his retirement that
same year. At the age of 31, Bush declared for the seat, and he and
Laura were off on what they call their extended honeymoon.
 &HT;    ``We had a really great time,'' recalls Laura Bush with a hearty
laugh, during an interview at the Governor's Mansion in Austin.
``It was a great way to spend the first year of marriage. We drove
up and down the Panhandle of Texas, from Hereford to Midland.''
 &HT;    In that campaign, Bush got his first taste of themes that
plagued his father's own races in Texas, which included two losing
bids for the U.S. Senate. George W.'s Democratic opponent, Kent
Hance, now a friend and supporter, cleverly played up Bush's
prep-school, Ivy League credentials, which didn't exactly go over
big in rough-and-tumble places such as Odessa.
 &HT;    With his father serving on international boards such as the
Rockefeller-financed Trilateral Commission, the candidate found
himself hectored by groups who said he too was surely a tool of the
New World Order. He finally had to go on record with his opposition
to ``one-world government and one monetary system.''
 &HT;    ``And if the Trilateral Commission supports those things,'' he
explained at the time, ``I'm sure my father is a dissenting
voice.''
 &HT;    Bush lost and, any political aspirations of his own put on hold
for the next decade and a half, he burrowed into the oil business,
founding an exploration company and digging into mineral records.
He was still known as a big party guy, and his friends gave him no
end of a hard time about being both a tightwad and a notoriously
sloppy dresser.
 &HT;    ``George would wear anything anyone would give him,'' said Dr.
Charles Younger, an orthopedic surgeon in Midland and a longtime
friend.
 &HT;    As the holiday season approached one year, his friends all got
together and collected a sheaf of tacky corporate Christmas cards
from West Texas oil firms, then conspicuously crossed out the
company name under the greeting and replaced it with ``Merry
Christmas, from George and Laura Bush.''
 &HT;    ``The funny thing is, I think at least half the people who got
them probably thought it was for real,'' Younger said, laughing.
``It just looked like, Here's that cheapskate Bush at it again,
trying to save money on his Christmas cards.''
 &HT;    But if Bush was a funny character with a pack of friends and a
fondness for good times, there was, by his own account and that of
his wife and friends, a problem with alcohol. He had drunk a lot
for years, and at times his boisterousness became downright
obnoxious: in one infamous incident, a well-lubricated Bush nearly
gave an old friend of his parents a heart attack at a cocktail
party, when he stumbled up to the matronly, elaborately dressed and
coiffed woman and said to her, ``So, what's sex like after 50,
anyway?''
 &HT;    In another incident, at the age of 26, he ran over a neighbor's
trash can and, according to a story that circulated in the 1994
campaign, challenged his perturbed father to go ``mano a mano''
when the senior Bush came out to inspect the damage. Bush now says
the story originated as a joking account by his mother, and has
been exaggerated.
 &HT;    ``It wasn't a fight,'' he said. ``It was an incident where I
drank too much, I believe was the background. It was kind of a
feisty guy talking to a father, and he kind of dismissed me, I
guess was what happened. I can't remember the exact words.''
 &HT;    Laura Bush says she wanted her husband to give up drinking, a
request she says she made not constantly, ``but every once in a
while, after some night that wasn't particularly great.'' Friends
say the marriage was seriously strained, though the governor denies
accounts by some that Laura gave him some sort of ultimatum.
 &HT;    ``Jack Daniels or the road?'' Bush said. ``I don't think so. I
don't remember that. No. She's a pretty patient person.''
 &HT;    In the end, Bush dealt with the problem in a characteristic way:
decisively, impulsively and without much evident introspection, at
least that he has shared publicly _ unlike, say, his predecessor,
former Texas Gov. Ann W. Richards, a dedicated member of Alcoholics
Anonymous who openly and widely discussed her problems with
alcohol.
 &HT;    On a summer night in 1986, spent with his wife and friends at
the Broadmoor resort in Colorado Springs in celebration of his and
some friends' 40th birthdays that year, Bush partied heartily. He
woke up with a raging hangover. To his stunned friends, he simply
began announcing that he had made a decision never to drink again.
 &HT;    It was a spontaneous pledge but one he has kept, Bush says. As
he put it to me a few years ago when I was preparing a story about
the contrasting ways in which he and Richards viewed
addiction-treatment programs in the state prison system (in sum, he
has much more faith in the cold-turkey approach): ``I quit for the
rest of my life and if you catch me drinking, it's not going to be
a good sign for your old buddy George.''
 &HT;    To this day, Bush says he does not know whether he is or was an
alcoholic. He thinks not, but he isn't really interested in
exploring the subject. ``I'm a high-energy person, and alcohol
competes with your energy,'' he said. ``It really does. So I
quit.''
 &HT;    During this time, Bush also got serious about the oil business,
prospering in the boom and skirting, like just about every other
oilman in Texas, financial ruin in the bust. His company merged
with another, struggled and in 1986 merged with the Harken Energy
Corp. of Irving, Texas, in a deal that gave him a financial
interest, directorship, consultancy and access to below-market
interest rates to buy more than $500,000 worth of stock.
 &HT;    With his father in the White House as vice president, George
W.'s break raised some eyebrows at the time, even more so when the
little-known Harken, which until that point had virtually no
experience in overseas exploration, won a lucrative contract to
drill for oil in Bahrain, in the Persian Gulf.
 &HT;    He also sold a large block of stock just before the company
announced poor quarterly earnings, raising questions of whether he
improperly used inside information. But George W. was never found
to have traded on his father's position to help the company nor
charged with any wrongdoing.

 &HT;    
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    By 1987, with his father set to launch a presidential campaign,
George W. Bush too was immersed in politics.
 &HT;    He spent months traipsing around Iowa and New Hampshire, making
contacts that actually may come in handy if he becomes _ as many
predict will be the case _ the Republican standard-bearer in 2000.
 &HT;    It was George W. who coordinated the job of making sure that
Bush loyalists were rewarded in the new administration.
 &HT;    But the younger Bush, expressing distaste for Washington and
perhaps with an eye on his own political future, moved back to
Dallas in 1989, getting involved in the venture he repeatedly
pointed to in his 1994 campaign for Texas governor as his signal
accomplishment: the new ballpark for the Rangers baseball team.
 &HT;    Part of a group that purchased 84 percent of the Rangers that
year for $86 million, Bush's own personal investment was barely
more than $600,000. He was made one of two managing partners, a
high-profile job that gave him frequent media exposure, at least on
the sports pages in Dallas and Fort Worth.
 &HT;    He was a constant presence at games, somewhat indelicately
explaining that he thought it important for ``folks to see me
sitting in the same seat they sit in, eating the same popcorn,
peeing in the same urinal.''
 &HT;    The major project during Bush's time with the club was the
planning and construction of the Ballpark in Arlington, one of the
new generation of old-fashioned baseball stadiums to which fans
have flocked in recent years. When he ran for governor in 1994 and
faced questions about his record (``eight games out of first,'' ran
the joke), Bush cited the park, more than a bit plaintively, as
proof of his ability to plan and execute big things.
 &HT;    ``My biggest liability in Texas is, What's the boy ever done?''
he told one paper. ``So he's got a famous father and ran a small
oil company. ... Now I can say I've done something. Here it is.''
To another, he explained: ``When all those people in Austin say,
'He ain't never done anything,' Well, this is it.''
 &HT;    The granite-and-brick Ballpark is indeed a thing of beauty, and
attendance at Rangers games soared. That the park was built with
the help of a voter-approved half-cent sales tax as well as with
eminent domain proceedings that generated local controversy has led
Bush's critics to suggest that his one self-described big thing is
curiously inconsistent with his conservative message.
 &HT;    ``Whether the public interest issue is taxes, size of
government, property rights or public subsidies of private sports
ventures,'' editorialized the liberal Texas Observer in a May 1997
article headlined ``Stealing Home,'' ``Bush's personal ownership in
the Texas Rangers baseball team has been wildly at odds with his
publicly declared positions on those issues.''
 &HT;    Whatever it says about his political philosophy, his relatively
small initial investment with the Rangers has turned out to be
immensely profitable, leading to recurring questions about whether
his corporate friends found a clever way to set him up financially
and thus free him up for politics.
 &HT;    Under his contract, his interest grew by an additional 10
percent as compensation for his service as managing partner. That
overall partnership merged with other investors and this year the
whole ownership was sold for $250 million, a deal netting Bush
$14.9 million.
 &HT;    Given the taxpayers' subsidy, this enormous profit has generated
criticism from State Land Commissioner Garry Mauro, Bush's
Democratic opponent, who calls it ``plain old corporate welfare.''
Bush said the ballpark is generating tax revenues that more than
offset the original sales-tax increase, and his office describes
the overall deal as a ``win-win'' situation for both Bush and
Arlington taxpayers.
 &HT;    Dissuading all other Republicans with his famous name and
powerful access to campaign funds, Bush got the gubernatorial
nomination in 1994 unopposed. It ventures far into the realm of
psychology to wonder just how much Bush was _ is _ motivated by
proving himself worthy of his famous name. While all this is
precisely the kind of ``psychobabble'' that both George Bushes
insist they don't indulge in anyway, John Ellis, his first cousin,
who lives in Boston, thinks it is ultimately off base.
 &HT;    ``I really think the opposite is true here,'' Ellis said. ``What
he was caught in for a long time was an 'I'll never be good enough,
I'll never be good enough' deal. At some point, though, he decided,
'I'll just take what I've got and we'll see what we can do with
that.' People will say he's running to prove something to the old
man, but the thing that really liberated him was the realization
that he didn't have to be his old man.''
 &HT;    As governor, Bush is a strong supporter of the death penalty and
has presided over a record number of executions, including that of
Karla Faye Tucker, the first woman put to death in Texas since the
Civil War and whose case sparked an international uproar earlier
this year. Bush's stance is broadly supported in Texas; it could
conceivably cause him problems in a general election in less
conservative states, though not, most likely, in the Republican
primaries.
 &HT;    And while other governors with an eye on the White House,
including those in Wisconsin and Michigan, have devised sweeping
job-training programs aimed at getting recipients off welfare,
Texas lags in that area, in large part because its welfare payments
are so low that there is little money available for such
approaches.
 &HT;    Bush applies the following spin to the state's relatively
minuscule welfare stipends: ``If you're trying to move people from
welfare to work,'' he says, ``that's exactly where you want your
payments to be.''
 &HT;    During his years as governor, Bush has grown far more
comfortable on the hustings. He is capable of moving an audience
with words like this: ``Today's challenge lies not so much outside
our borders as inside our souls.'' And he can make them laugh, as
when he cites his travails as the father of twin teen-age
daughters, Barbara and Jenna.
 &HT;    ``No one warned me!'' he says in mock horror. ``There are not
enough DPS officers in Austin to protect my fellow Texans from
these new drivers.''
 &HT;    Around the Capitol, his style is jocular and informal, and he is
not exactly known as a policy wonk. It is not lost on visitors that
his office is lined with cases full of baseballs, not books.
Meetings with Bush do not drag on into the wee hours.
 &HT;    ``Like a lot of great leaders,'' State Sen. Teel Bivins, a
Republican from Amarillo, jokingly says, ``he has about a 20-second
attention span. He listens to your issues, analyzes, gets to the
heart of them, makes a decision, gets bored and is ready to move
on.''
 &HT;    Everywhere he goes, the governor is asked if he will run for
Dad's old job. He says he genuinely does not know. ``The bubble,''
he says, summarizing what he calls the case against going for it
all. ``It's the perpetual bubble. It's not a one-time bubble. It's
life.''
 &HT;    Or, as Laura Bush cheerfully puts it: ``It's sort of a stretch
for me, because I could just as soon, you know, hang around and
work in the yard.''
 &HT;    Bush says that if he runs, it will be because he has a clear and
compelling idea in his mind of where he wants to take the nation _
and not because he wants to avenge his father's defeat in 1992.
``You can't lead people from a pessimistic or revengeful point of
view,'' he says.
 &HT;    The general consensus among the governor's friends is that,
inevitably, he will run. It's in the family's blood. If Bush does
run, he is likely to encounter little trouble finding money. He is
already generating huge amounts from out of state. (Nearly half of
his most recent four-month haul of $4.4 million came from outside
Texas.)
 &HT;    There is certainly a case to be made against George Bush. There
are entire realms of policy _ such as, say, foreign policy _ that
he has simply never dealt with. Albert R. Hunt, a Wall Street
Journal columnist, recently observed that that Bush would be the
Republicans' ``most inexperienced nominee since Wendell Willkie in
1940.''
 &HT;    As the nomination fight gets under way, Bush is unlikely to
start off with the firm blessing of the religious right. ``I don't
think that George W. Bush would be the favored candidate of the
religious right under any circumstances _ he's far too moderate for
them,'' said John C. Green, a professor at the University of Akron
and an expert on the religious right in American politics. ``He
could be their second choice, or their third or fourth or fifth.
That's the big question.''
 &HT;    The governor does have an important bridge to at least one
faction of religious conservatives: not the militantly
rather-be-right-than-be-president set, but the more pragmatic wing
embodied by Ralph Reed, the former executive director of the
Christian Coalition and current political strategist, with whom
Bush talks frequently.
 &HT;    Many Republicans think Reed is likely to settle on Bush as a
candidate who can advance at least part of the agenda of religious
conservatives _ and actually win a general election. On the record,
Reed would say only that the Republican Party is likely to have
``an embarrassment of riches, a heck of a lot of great candidates
out there'' in 2000.
 &HT;    There is also the question of groundwork. A spokesman for Lamar
Alexander, for instance, notes that the former Tennessee governor,
who ran in 1996 and plans to do so again in 2000, has spent an
average of a few days every month in both Iowa and New Hampshire
these past few years. Since becoming governor, Bush has literally
not set foot in either state. That may mean a great deal, but then
again, it may not.
 &HT;    ``What someone like Lamar Alexander could do with 1,000 lobster
dinners in New Hampshire, someone like George Bush could walk in
and do on the first day,'' says Alex Castellanos, a Republican
consultant. ``Because he's not George W. Smith. He's George W.
Bush.''

STUDY SHOWS CALIFORNIANS DON'T EAT ENOUGH FRUIT, VEGGIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANASTASIA HENDRIX  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It took about five seconds of intense
concentration for Cliff Truesdell to recall the last time he ate a
fresh fruit or vegetable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, it was a kiwi fruit, yesterday afternoon,'' the
31-year-old temporary services worker said with a note of triumph
in his voice. Admittedly, he said, he rarely eats a serving a day,
let alone the five recommended helpings.
</P>
<P>
   When the state Department of Health Services randomly asked the
same kind of question to more than 1,700 other Californians, the
responses were much the same.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that most adults are eating 3.8 servings a day,
a drop from the 4.1 servings in 1995 and the lowest amount since
1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been steadily improving, and honestly, that's what we
expected to find this year until the data came in,'' said Trinette
Beauchemin, a spokeswoman for the health department. ``We were
pretty surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   While the drop may not be that much statistically, it represents
almost 150 missed servings per year per person of foods such as
bananas and green beans.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that adds up, especially given what we know in terms of
health implications,'' Beauchemin said.
</P>
<P>
   Nutrition experts say that mom was right when she told you to
eat an apple a day and finish your spinach. Researchers say diets
rich in fruit and vegetables can help prevent heart disease,
diabetes, cancer and other ailments associated with poor diet and
obesity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's alarming that with all the effort that has been made to
increase the consumption (of fruits and vegetables) that it is
actually slipping,'' said Ann Coulston, senior research dietitian
at Stanford University Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   But with the temptation of cookies, brownies, cakes, soft drinks
and candy bars constantly vying for attention and appetites, she
said, it takes extra effort to make the best choices.
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Ikeda, a nutrition education specialist at the University
of California at Berkeley, speculated that if more people had
access to juicier fruits and more savory selections of vegetables,
perhaps the numbers would start inching upward again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grow tomatoes and have a peach tree at home, and the flavors
are so incredible,'' she said. ``I've tasted peaches that taste
better than any candy I have ever had in my life, and I don't see
that as the standard available at the supermarket.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't without irony, the state health department
spokeswoman said, since California provides more than half of the
produce consumed across the country.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that difficult, Beauchemin said, to add a few servings
here and there to improve your diet and squeeze in a few more
servings a day.
</P>
<P>
   Among her suggestions: Ask for extra lettuce or tomatoes on your
burger; order a side salad instead of fries and orange juice
instead of a soda.
</P>
<P>
   The report was released in conjunction with ``National 5 A Day
Week,'' a campaign to boost public awareness about the importance
of a healthy, balanced diet.
</P>
<P>
   The state study also found that blacks in California ate an
average of 3.1 servings a day, up only slightly from 3.0 in 1995.
For Hispanics, it dropped from 4.7 servings in 1995 to 3.9.
</P>
<P>
   Economics also seemed to play a role: People earning less than
$15,000 per year ate just 3.1 servings a day, compared with 3.8
servings for people with incomes from $15,000 to $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   The best diets were found among those earning $25,000 to $35,000
_ 4.3 servings per day. People earning over $50,000 a year ate just
3.9 servings.

THIS FALL, PBS MEETS THE NETWORKS HEAD-ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Traditionally, the Public Broadcasting Service hasn't behaved
like its commercially supported brethren because it would be so
unseemly. Never mind that PBS has become so quasi-commercial that
it won't be long before we see a ``Great Performances'' piece on
the Amazing Kreskin made possible by the Psychic Friends Foundation
and viewers like you.
</P>
<P>
   In its elitist way, PBS prefers to ask, ``If PBS doesn't do it,
who will?''
</P>
<P>
   These days, the answer is cable. A lot of the gutsy,
unconventional programming that used to fall within the purview of
PBS now shows up on A&AMP;E, Discovery Channel, The History Channel and
even premium services like HBO and Showtime. PBS is no longer the
exclusive domain of the so-called ``non-commercial'' program.
</P>
<P>
   This is great for TV snobs, but it's rough on PBS, which faces a
classic Shakespearean dilemma: to snoot, or not to snoot. Skewing
snootier might be smart for demographic purposes; snootiness
usually equates to higher income, higher education, higher
expectations _ the sort of audience any broadcaster would covet.
But it is self-limiting in a big way because not everyone can do
snooty. For one thing, studies indicate that keeping one's nose in
the air for extended periods leads to serious postnasal drip.
</P>
<P>
   So PBS has gone the other way in recent years, trying to broaden
its audience with a wider range of programming. In so doing it has
mimicked the commercial networks, coming out with some of its most
celebrated programming _ the latest Ken Burns blockbuster, for
example _ during a ratings sweep when all the commercial networks
are falling over themselves to attract attention with bloated
miniseries, landmark episodes and the like.
</P>
<P>
   It's a strategy that has drawn complaints from viewers and
critics, but PBS president Ervin Duggan handles them with ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an exciting arena to operate in,'' he said. ``We are
shot at from every conceivable position. We are hectored to raise
more money from ancillary revenue sources, like toys. And when we
do that we are then hectored ... because people on the other side
consider us to be crass merchandisers.''
</P>
<P>
   Duggan said he takes all the complaints as a perverse sort of
compliment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they (the complaints) say is that people feel a sense of
ownership. They have a proprietary feeling and high expectations
about what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Quattrrone, PBS's head of programming, says some of the
scheduling coincidences are just that: coincidences. But she does
admit to a little intentional head-to-head jousting with the big
boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do try and use the tools that are at our disposal in terms
of scheduling, advertising and promotion to position our programs
as best we can,'' she said, ``as a part of the television
landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   So don't be surprised when one of PBS's major efforts, ``The
Farmer's Wife,'' makes its debut next Monday, the single busiest
day of the new fall schedule for the commercial networks, with 12
season premieres scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   For TV snobs, it is not of great moment. But for plebeians like
me, who watch ``Ally McBeal'' on Monday nights while taping
``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' it's an inconvenience, because ``The
Farmer's Wife'' is certainly worth a visit, even if it is
interminable and depressing.
</P>
<P>
   PBS makes no apologies, and it shouldn't have to. Putting its
best stuff against the networks's best (or best-hyped) is only an
issue because there are so many fallow periods during the
commercial TV season. That's not the fault of PBS, and PBS
shouldn't be expected to save its great material for times when the
networks are shooting blanks. Who can blame it for wanting to cash
in on the larger audiences that are drawn to TV at this time of
year?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it's impossible to find a week when there isn't
something of substance on PBS, so the dueling-programs situation
with the networks is bound to continue anyway. We should all hope
its gets even more pronounced. What a wonderful problem to have:
good shows on every channel at every hour!
</P>
<P>
   Duggan says you can think what you want, but PBS isn't into
stunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Momentary excitement is not what we're about,'' he declared.
``Flash-in-the-pan controversy or brilliance is not what we're
about. What we're trying to do is create a steady glow of
excellence that goes on and on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   In that spirit, here are some of what PBS expects to be its
brighter lights this fall. Check local listings for times and air
dates.

 &HT;    
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    By 1987, with his father set to launch a presidential campaign,
George W. Bush too was immersed in politics.
 &HT;    He spent months traipsing around Iowa and New Hampshire, making
contacts that actually may come in handy if he becomes _ as many
predict will be the case _ the Republican standard-bearer in 2000.
 &HT;    It was George W. who coordinated the job of making sure that
Bush loyalists were rewarded in the new administration.
 &HT;    But the younger Bush, expressing distaste for Washington and
perhaps with an eye on his own political future, moved back to
Dallas in 1989, getting involved in the venture he repeatedly
pointed to in his 1994 campaign for Texas governor as his signal
accomplishment: the new ballpark for the Rangers baseball team.
 &HT;    Part of a group that purchased 84 percent of the Rangers that
year for $86 million, Bush's own personal investment was barely
more than $600,000. He was made one of two managing partners, a
high-profile job that gave him frequent media exposure, at least on
the sports pages in Dallas and Fort Worth.
 &HT;    He was a constant presence at games, somewhat indelicately
explaining that he thought it important for ``folks to see me
sitting in the same seat they sit in, eating the same popcorn,
peeing in the same urinal.''
 &HT;    The major project during Bush's time with the club was the
planning and construction of the Ballpark in Arlington, one of the
new generation of old-fashioned baseball stadiums to which fans
have flocked in recent years. When he ran for governor in 1994 and
faced questions about his record (``eight games out of first,'' ran
the joke), Bush cited the park, more than a bit plaintively, as
proof of his ability to plan and execute big things.
 &HT;    ``My biggest liability in Texas is, What's the boy ever done?''
he told one paper. ``So he's got a famous father and ran a small
oil company. ... Now I can say I've done something. Here it is.''
To another, he explained: ``When all those people in Austin say,
'He ain't never done anything,' Well, this is it.''
 &HT;    The granite-and-brick Ballpark is indeed a thing of beauty, and
attendance at Rangers games soared. That the park was built with
the help of a voter-approved half-cent sales tax as well as with
eminent domain proceedings that generated local controversy has led
Bush's critics to suggest that his one self-described big thing is
curiously inconsistent with his conservative message.
 &HT;    ``Whether the public interest issue is taxes, size of
government, property rights or public subsidies of private sports
ventures,'' editorialized the liberal Texas Observer in a May 1997
article headlined ``Stealing Home,'' ``Bush's personal ownership in
the Texas Rangers baseball team has been wildly at odds with his
publicly declared positions on those issues.''
 &HT;    Whatever it says about his political philosophy, his relatively
small initial investment with the Rangers has turned out to be
immensely profitable, leading to recurring questions about whether
his corporate friends found a clever way to set him up financially
and thus free him up for politics.
 &HT;    Under his contract, his interest grew by an additional 10
percent as compensation for his service as managing partner. That
overall partnership merged with other investors and this year the
whole ownership was sold for $250 million, a deal netting Bush
$14.9 million.
 &HT;    Given the taxpayers' subsidy, this enormous profit has generated
criticism from State Land Commissioner Garry Mauro, Bush's
Democratic opponent, who calls it ``plain old corporate welfare.''
Bush said the ballpark is generating tax revenues that more than
offset the original sales-tax increase, and his office describes
the overall deal as a ``win-win'' situation for both Bush and
Arlington taxpayers.
 &HT;    Dissuading all other Republicans with his famous name and
powerful access to campaign funds, Bush got the gubernatorial
nomination in 1994 unopposed. It ventures far into the realm of
psychology to wonder just how much Bush was _ is _ motivated by
proving himself worthy of his famous name. While all this is
precisely the kind of ``psychobabble'' that both George Bushes
insist they don't indulge in anyway, John Ellis, his first cousin,
who lives in Boston, thinks it is ultimately off base.
 &HT;    ``I really think the opposite is true here,'' Ellis said. ``What
he was caught in for a long time was an 'I'll never be good enough,
I'll never be good enough' deal. At some point, though, he decided,
'I'll just take what I've got and we'll see what we can do with
that.' People will say he's running to prove something to the old
man, but the thing that really liberated him was the realization
that he didn't have to be his old man.''
 &HT;    As governor, Bush is a strong supporter of the death penalty and
has presided over a record number of executions, including that of
Karla Faye Tucker, the first woman put to death in Texas since the
Civil War and whose case sparked an international uproar earlier
this year. Bush's stance is broadly supported in Texas; it could
conceivably cause him problems in a general election in less
conservative states, though not, most likely, in the Republican
primaries.
 &HT;    And while other governors with an eye on the White House,
including those in Wisconsin and Michigan, have devised sweeping
job-training programs aimed at getting recipients off welfare,
Texas lags in that area, in large part because its welfare payments
are so low that there is little money available for such
approaches.
 &HT;    Bush applies the following spin to the state's relatively
minuscule welfare stipends: ``If you're trying to move people from
welfare to work,'' he says, ``that's exactly where you want your
payments to be.''
 &HT;    During his years as governor, Bush has grown far more
comfortable on the hustings. He is capable of moving an audience
with words like this: ``Today's challenge lies not so much outside
our borders as inside our souls.'' And he can make them laugh, as
when he cites his travails as the father of twin teen-age
daughters, Barbara and Jenna.
 &HT;    ``No one warned me!'' he says in mock horror. ``There are not
enough DPS officers in Austin to protect my fellow Texans from
these new drivers.''
 &HT;    Around the Capitol, his style is jocular and informal, and he is
not exactly known as a policy wonk. It is not lost on visitors that
his office is lined with cases full of baseballs, not books.
Meetings with Bush do not drag on into the wee hours.
 &HT;    ``Like a lot of great leaders,'' State Sen. Teel Bivins, a
Republican from Amarillo, jokingly says, ``he has about a 20-second
attention span. He listens to your issues, analyzes, gets to the
heart of them, makes a decision, gets bored and is ready to move
on.''
 &HT;    Everywhere he goes, the governor is asked if he will run for
Dad's old job. He says he genuinely does not know. ``The bubble,''
he says, summarizing what he calls the case against going for it
all. ``It's the perpetual bubble. It's not a one-time bubble. It's
life.''
 &HT;    Or, as Laura Bush cheerfully puts it: ``It's sort of a stretch
for me, because I could just as soon, you know, hang around and
work in the yard.''
 &HT;    Bush says that if he runs, it will be because he has a clear and
compelling idea in his mind of where he wants to take the nation _
and not because he wants to avenge his father's defeat in 1992.
``You can't lead people from a pessimistic or revengeful point of
view,'' he says.
 &HT;    The general consensus among the governor's friends is that,
inevitably, he will run. It's in the family's blood. If Bush does
run, he is likely to encounter little trouble finding money. He is
already generating huge amounts from out of state. (Nearly half of
his most recent four-month haul of $4.4 million came from outside
Texas.)
 &HT;    There is certainly a case to be made against George Bush. There
are entire realms of policy _ such as, say, foreign policy _ that
he has simply never dealt with. Albert R. Hunt, a Wall Street
Journal columnist, recently observed that that Bush would be the
Republicans' ``most inexperienced nominee since Wendell Willkie in
1940.''
 &HT;    As the nomination fight gets under way, Bush is unlikely to
start off with the firm blessing of the religious right. ``I don't
think that George W. Bush would be the favored candidate of the
religious right under any circumstances _ he's far too moderate for
them,'' said John C. Green, a professor at the University of Akron
and an expert on the religious right in American politics. ``He
could be their second choice, or their third or fourth or fifth.
That's the big question.''
 &HT;    The governor does have an important bridge to at least one
faction of religious conservatives: not the militantly
rather-be-right-than-be-president set, but the more pragmatic wing
embodied by Ralph Reed, the former executive director of the
Christian Coalition and current political strategist, with whom
Bush talks frequently.
 &HT;    Many Republicans think Reed is likely to settle on Bush as a
candidate who can advance at least part of the agenda of religious
conservatives _ and actually win a general election. On the record,
Reed would say only that the Republican Party is likely to have
``an embarrassment of riches, a heck of a lot of great candidates
out there'' in 2000.
 &HT;    There is also the question of groundwork. A spokesman for Lamar
Alexander, for instance, notes that the former Tennessee governor,
who ran in 1996 and plans to do so again in 2000, has spent an
average of a few days every month in both Iowa and New Hampshire
these past few years. Since becoming governor, Bush has literally
not set foot in either state. That may mean a great deal, but then
again, it may not.
 &HT;    ``What someone like Lamar Alexander could do with 1,000 lobster
dinners in New Hampshire, someone like George Bush could walk in
and do on the first day,'' says Alex Castellanos, a Republican
consultant. ``Because he's not George W. Smith. He's George W.
Bush.''

 WILD YOUNG '60s GUY JUMPS INTO MARRIAGE, BUSINESS and POLITICS

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    There is something potentially incongruous about George W. Bush
as the self-described promoter of ``a responsibility era.'' As one
who seems to have indulged freely in his past, Bush now routinely
lectures high-schoolers to ``abstain from sex until you've found
the person you want to marry.''
 &HT;    And when Bush stepped ever so gingerly into the White House sex
scandal, saying recently he felt ``embarrassed for the country,''
Lanny J. Davis, a Clinton adviser, leapt in with a response. Noting
that he had been at Yale with Bush, Davis said on national
television that the governor ``shouldn't throw stones.''
 &HT;    On the other hand, Bush's message is reflective of the country
at large. He is, after all, just one of countless tens of thousands
of parents who came of age in the 1960s and are now saying much the
same thing to their kids.
 &HT;    In a generally laudatory piece about Bush's campaign for values
in this summer's edition of City Journal, a publication of the
conservative Manhattan Institute, Tucker Carlson suggested that
Bush may in fact be the perfect spokesman for ``the politics of
virtue.''
 &HT;    ``Before his marriage, Bush had a reputation (from all accounts,
deserved) as something of a wild man,'' Carlson wrote. ``When he
speaks, it is as a grizzled veteran of the sexual revolution. But
he is a changed man.''
 &HT;    In a two-and-a-half-page letter, with responses to a series of
questions I posed for this article, President Bush (he declined to
be interviewed) made a point of dismissing the notion that his son
ever seriously lost his way in any of these years.
 &HT;    ``I asked Barbara to read this letter,'' the president wrote.
``She asked me to add that, like me, she never felt George was a
problem _ that he never had trouble 'finding himself.' She
believes, as I do, that 'the wild young man' thesis is greatly
overblown.
 &HT;    ``George really never had trouble 'finding himself,''' Bush
added in the next paragraph. ``He had some happy times, but none of
this 'worried' Barbara and me. He never lost his bearing. He always
came home.''
 &HT;    In 1973, George W. Bush decided he wanted to become serious
about a business career, and he entered Harvard Business School.
Two years later, driving a 1970 Cutlass, he retraced a famous
journey to West Texas his father made in 1948, and headed back
south and west toward dusty Midland. True, given his family
contacts, this was hardly a journey into the great unknown.
 &HT;    Bush's plan was to jump into the oil business, but before long
he was jumping into other things as well: marriage and politics. In
1977, he married Laura Welch, a librarian and schoolteacher from
Midland who is, by wide agreement, a crucial influence in both the
governor's personal transformation and his political success.
 &HT;    With a down-to-earth style, an infectious sense of humor and
campaigns reminiscent of her mother-in-law's, for breast-cancer
awareness and literacy, she is wildly popular in Texas.
 &HT;    Having rarely even been in the area for a decade before his
return, Bush made a brash decision when the 44-year incumbent
Democratic congressman, George Mahon, announced his retirement that
same year. At the age of 31, Bush declared for the seat, and he and
Laura were off on what they call their extended honeymoon.
 &HT;    ``We had a really great time,'' recalls Laura Bush with a hearty
laugh, during an interview at the Governor's Mansion in Austin.
``It was a great way to spend the first year of marriage. We drove
up and down the Panhandle of Texas, from Hereford to Midland.''
 &HT;    In that campaign, Bush got his first taste of themes that
plagued his father's own races in Texas, which included two losing
bids for the U.S. Senate. George W.'s Democratic opponent, Kent
Hance, now a friend and supporter, cleverly played up Bush's
prep-school, Ivy League credentials, which didn't exactly go over
big in rough-and-tumble places such as Odessa.
 &HT;    With his father serving on international boards such as the
Rockefeller-financed Trilateral Commission, the candidate found
himself hectored by groups who said he too was surely a tool of the
New World Order. He finally had to go on record with his opposition
to ``one-world government and one monetary system.''
 &HT;    ``And if the Trilateral Commission supports those things,'' he
explained at the time, ``I'm sure my father is a dissenting
voice.''
 &HT;    Bush lost and, any political aspirations of his own put on hold
for the next decade and a half, he burrowed into the oil business,
founding an exploration company and digging into mineral records.
He was still known as a big party guy, and his friends gave him no
end of a hard time about being both a tightwad and a notoriously
sloppy dresser.
 &HT;    ``George would wear anything anyone would give him,'' said Dr.
Charles Younger, an orthopedic surgeon in Midland and a longtime
friend.
 &HT;    As the holiday season approached one year, his friends all got
together and collected a sheaf of tacky corporate Christmas cards
from West Texas oil firms, then conspicuously crossed out the
company name under the greeting and replaced it with ``Merry
Christmas, from George and Laura Bush.''
 &HT;    ``The funny thing is, I think at least half the people who got
them probably thought it was for real,'' Younger said, laughing.
``It just looked like, Here's that cheapskate Bush at it again,
trying to save money on his Christmas cards.''
 &HT;    But if Bush was a funny character with a pack of friends and a
fondness for good times, there was, by his own account and that of
his wife and friends, a problem with alcohol. He had drunk a lot
for years, and at times his boisterousness became downright
obnoxious: in one infamous incident, a well-lubricated Bush nearly
gave an old friend of his parents a heart attack at a cocktail
party, when he stumbled up to the matronly, elaborately dressed and
coiffed woman and said to her, ``So, what's sex like after 50,
anyway?''
 &HT;    In another incident, at the age of 26, he ran over a neighbor's
trash can and, according to a story that circulated in the 1994
campaign, challenged his perturbed father to go ``mano a mano''
when the senior Bush came out to inspect the damage. Bush now says
the story originated as a joking account by his mother, and has
been exaggerated.
 &HT;    ``It wasn't a fight,'' he said. ``It was an incident where I
drank too much, I believe was the background. It was kind of a
feisty guy talking to a father, and he kind of dismissed me, I
guess was what happened. I can't remember the exact words.''
 &HT;    Laura Bush says she wanted her husband to give up drinking, a
request she says she made not constantly, ``but every once in a
while, after some night that wasn't particularly great.'' Friends
say the marriage was seriously strained, though the governor denies
accounts by some that Laura gave him some sort of ultimatum.
 &HT;    ``Jack Daniels or the road?'' Bush said. ``I don't think so. I
don't remember that. No. She's a pretty patient person.''
 &HT;    In the end, Bush dealt with the problem in a characteristic way:
decisively, impulsively and without much evident introspection, at
least that he has shared publicly _ unlike, say, his predecessor,
former Texas Gov. Ann W. Richards, a dedicated member of Alcoholics
Anonymous who openly and widely discussed her problems with
alcohol.
 &HT;    On a summer night in 1986, spent with his wife and friends at
the Broadmoor resort in Colorado Springs in celebration of his and
some friends' 40th birthdays that year, Bush partied heartily. He
woke up with a raging hangover. To his stunned friends, he simply
began announcing that he had made a decision never to drink again.
 &HT;    It was a spontaneous pledge but one he has kept, Bush says. As
he put it to me a few years ago when I was preparing a story about
the contrasting ways in which he and Richards viewed
addiction-treatment programs in the state prison system (in sum, he
has much more faith in the cold-turkey approach): ``I quit for the
rest of my life and if you catch me drinking, it's not going to be
a good sign for your old buddy George.''
 &HT;    To this day, Bush says he does not know whether he is or was an
alcoholic. He thinks not, but he isn't really interested in
exploring the subject. ``I'm a high-energy person, and alcohol
competes with your energy,'' he said. ``It really does. So I
quit.''
 &HT;    During this time, Bush also got serious about the oil business,
prospering in the boom and skirting, like just about every other
oilman in Texas, financial ruin in the bust. His company merged
with another, struggled and in 1986 merged with the Harken Energy
Corp. of Irving, Texas, in a deal that gave him a financial
interest, directorship, consultancy and access to below-market
interest rates to buy more than $500,000 worth of stock.
 &HT;    With his father in the White House as vice president, George
W.'s break raised some eyebrows at the time, even more so when the
little-known Harken, which until that point had virtually no
experience in overseas exploration, won a lucrative contract to
drill for oil in Bahrain, in the Persian Gulf.
 &HT;    He also sold a large block of stock just before the company
announced poor quarterly earnings, raising questions of whether he
improperly used inside information. But George W. was never found
to have traded on his father's position to help the company nor
charged with any wrongdoing.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    George W. Bush, the governor of Texas, likes to say that the
fundamental difference between him and his father is that the
former president attended Greenwich Country Day School, while he
went to San Jacinto Junior High School in Midland, Texas.
 &HT;    Born in 1946 in New Haven, George and Barbara Bush's first
child, young ``Georgie'' was along for the famous journey when his
father struck out for West Texas in a 1947 Studebaker.
 &HT;    He was a mischievous boy with a passion for sports, especially
baseball, and a penchant for wisecracks that may well have its
origins in a family tragedy. George was 7 years old when his
sister, Robin, 3, died of leukemia, and both of his parents told
friends that George seemed to develop a joking, bantering style in
a determined bid to lift them from their grief. (There are five
Bush children, four sons and a surviving daughter.)
 &HT;    He did spend many formative years in Midland, and attended the
public schools there. But while his identity as a Texan has never
been mocked to the degree his father's was, the younger Bush has
preppy credentials that parallel those of his father. He went to
Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., and to Yale University. In
fact, much of Bush's life seems to be a slightly eerie, and not
always successful, bid to retrace the footsteps of the famous
father.
 &HT;    ``You have to really understand how much his father was loved
and respected by so many people to understand what it would be like
to grow up as a namesake, the son of George Bush, `` said George W.
Bush's first cousin, John Ellis, a Boston-based marketing and
advertising consultant who is close to the governor.
 &HT;    ``There are all these parallels in his life. 'He went to
Andover, went to Yale, went to West Texas, ran for Congress, and at
every stage of that he was found wanting. To go through every stage
of life and be found wanting and know that people find you wanting,
that's a real grind.''
 &HT;    To Bush's critics, his prolonged rowdy days and his
unspectacular early career make his later political success _ in
which simply having the name ``George Bush'' was undeniably a
crucial, perhaps THE crucial, element _ all the more irritating,
and undeserved. But in Ellis' view, his cousin's later
achievements, which came after his marriage and his decision to
quit drinking, are all the more impressive in light of the wayward
years.
 &HT;    ``He gathered it together,'' said Ellis. ``George was on the
road to nowhere at 40. At the age of 52, he's the front-runner for
the Republican presidential nomination. That's a pretty incredible
turnaround.''
 &HT;    Bush himself does not deny that he is a classic late bloomer; he
refers to the ``nomadic years'' of his youth and once explained he
``kind of floated and saw a lot of life'' throughout his 20s. He
even jokes about all this, though one wonders if the stand-up
monologue he delivered to a howling audience this past winter at
Washington's elite Alfalfa Club, with his father present, had just
a tinge of bitter truth to it.
 &HT;    ``Can you imagine how much it hurt,'' said George Walker Bush,
``to know that Dad's idea of the perfect son was'' _ and then he
paused before delivering the line that brought down the house _
``Al Gore?''
 &HT;    At Yale, just like his father, Bush was in the secretive Skull
and Bones club. He was president of his fraternity, Delta Kappa
Epsilon, though, as a less-than-diligent student, he did not follow
the old man into Phi Beta Kappa. In any event, he says he did not
like a lot of the ``intellectual arrogance'' and ''snobs'' at Yale,
and he cites one incident as particularly galling.
 &HT;    Several months after his father lost the 1964 Texas Senate
campaign to Ralph Yarborough, the incumbent Democratic populist,
Bush said he met Yale's prominent campus chaplain.
 &HT;    ``I ran into William Sloane Coffin, who was the preacher at
Yale, supposedly the guy that was there to comfort students,'' the
governor said. ``I introduced myself and he said, Yeah, I know your
father, and your father lost to a better man.''
 &HT;    Even today, 33 years later, Bush is clearly offended by the
statement, and it is one of the many reasons, he says, that he
couldn't wait to get back to Texas, after his graduation in 1968:
``Texas people are more polite. I don't think a Texan would do that
to a son.''
 &HT;    When Bush talks about his father, this is not the only trace of
bitterness. Victory in the Persian Gulf War, he told Texas Monthly,
was ``one of the great achievements of the 20th century, and it had
a shelf life of about a month.'' He is also still bothered, as he
later puts it in an interview, by the ``factors that caused this
good man to get defeated.''
 &HT;    And he raises at least one that could well resurface in some
fashion: ``Patrick J. Buchanan handing the baton, the proverbial
political knife, off to Ross Perot _ the kind of isolationism and
nativism and very harsh attacks against George Bush. You die a
death of a thousand cuts in the political process.''
 &HT;    George the younger obviously loves and reveres his father, and
he has plenty of characteristics _ the impish half-grin, the chop
in the air, the passion for foods that gross out some of his staff
(bologna sandwiches, in his case) _ that strikingly betray his
genes.
 &HT;    And yet, President Bush has been curiously absent from his son's
campaigns and oratory. Barbara Bush shows up much more often. One
of the governor's stock campaign jokes involves going to get his
hair cut, and having the barber marvel: ``I can't believe I'm
cutting the hair of the son of Barbara Bush.''
 &HT;    Partly, the governor simply wants to be seen as his own man _
not ``just another rich son of a Bush,'' as the Texas populist Jim
Hightower describes him. And for his part, the president ``almost
makes it a point not to advise him too much, on the theory that
people would say, 'Hey, you're just Daddy's boy,' `` said George
Strake, a former Republican state chairman in Texas and a Bush
family friend.
 &HT;    But there is clearly another undercurrent here. While President
Bush remains personally popular with Americans, any prominent role
in a national campaign could resurrect the ambivalence many
Republicans felt about him. And it could lead to questions about
just how his son differs from him politically, if at all.
 &HT;    Neither Bush nor his top aides will even take much of a stab at
that. (One, insisting he not be quoted by name, offered this
thought: ``I think the father was more of a noblesse oblige
politician, while George W. Bush is a conviction politician.''
Hardly a comparison to flatter the old man.)
 &HT;    President and Mrs. Bush declined requests for an interview for
this story. But a couple of weeks ago, a two-and-a-half-page letter
from Kennebunkport came whirring across my fax machine, a response
to a series of written questions.
 &HT;    In it, President Bush wrote of the ``enormous pride'' he felt as
he watched two of his sons make their way in public life. ``Both
Jeb and George were at my side in some pretty tough times,'' he
said, ``and they know firsthand what Teddy Roosevelt's `Arena' is
really like. I hope they never say, 'It's not worth it.'''
 &HT;    The former president said he was reluctant to speak out on
issues these days, ''because I don't want some reporter from
Washington rushing down to one of our sons after I stake out a
position on an issue saying: 'Your Dad says so and so. ... Why
don't you agree?'
 &HT;    ``I had my chance,'' Bush continued. ``Now it is their time and
I am determined to stay out of the way. To support them where they
want me to. But not to inadvertently cause complications for
them.''
 &HT;    George W. Bush knows that if he runs, everybody will be asking
questions about his relationship with his father. ``Doonesbury''
has already given the governor his cartoon identity: a junior-size
point of light. The governor says he's neither concerned nor
interested. ``These are the kind of psychological analyses that I'm
not really thrilled about talking about,'' he explains. ``It's not
my thing.
 &HT;    ``You occasionally read about, 'Well, he must prove himself''' _
the governor draws out the words with a theatrical flair _ ```to be
different from his father.' The voice is out of Washington, and the
Echo Chamber. `Well, he must distinguish himself''' _ more emphasis
_ ```from his father.' Well, therein lies the dilemma. But I don't
listen to them. Because all I've got to do is be myself.
 &HT;    ``By being myself I will distinguish myself from my father,
because we're two separately different people. I've got half my
mother in me and half my father in me, which is a pretty
interesting combination.''
 &HT;    When George W. got back to Texas in 1968, he joined the Texas
Air National Guard and for five years spent some weekends and
longer stints flying fighter jets. His unit was never called for
service in the Vietnam War, and by enlisting in the guard, he was
automatically removed as a candidate for the military draft, an
issue that flared briefly in the 1994 gubernatorial campaign and
undoubtedly would again in a national race.
 &HT;    In 1992, gearing up for his Texas campaign, Bush told The New
York Times that while he was prepared to serve, he had trouble
remembering what his position was on the war when he was in
college. While that may sound implausible, people who knew him at
the time said that Bush indeed showed virtually no interest in
public policy, or politics.
 &HT;    It seems inconceivable, for instance, that he could ever have
written anyone a letter brooding over how to ``maintain my
political viability within the system,'' to use the memorable
phrase from a 1969 letter sent by a young man named Bill Clinton,
born the month after George W. Bush, to the director of the
University of Arkansas' Reserve Officers Training Corps program.
 &HT;    What most seems to have marked the decade after Bush graduated
from college was his wandering, carousing nature. He held a series
of jobs, working on an offshore rig and (miserably) for an
agricultural firm, and mentoring inner-city youth in Houston.
 &HT;    But he was best known as a major-league partygoer, often seen
driving around town in his Triumph and in the company of attractive
young women.
 &HT;    As governor, Bush has clearly succeeded in drawing a rather huge
zone of privacy around the question of just how wild his wild days
were. He declines to answer specific questions about matters such
as drug use.
 &HT;    ``There were things I did that were mistakes,'' he said. ``But I
think inventorying mistakes is a mistake. I think they send wrong
signals. I think they undermine the message.
 &HT;    ``I'd be the first to admit that I did irresponsible things when
I was young and irresponsible,'' he continued. ``I've assumed the
mantle of being a governor and a father in a responsible way, and
the signal we ought to send to our children is that in spite of
what happened in the '60s and '70s, we have learned some lessons.
And the lesson ought to be, don't be using drugs and alcohol. Learn
the lessons from the past.''

 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 NOTE: Full-length article (8,600 words) available on request  
 &HT;    George Walker Bush was visiting his parents in the White House
one day when the talk turned to religion, which is precisely the
subject that some powerful factions in the Republican Party want
their presidential standard-bearer to talk about, forcefully, in
2000.
 &HT;    But Bush, sitting one day recently on a sofa in the governor's
office at the Texas State Capitol, says he is ``cautious about
wearing my religion on my sleeve in the political process.'' And he
offers this particular story to explain why.
 &HT;    ``Mother and I were arguing _ not arguing, having a discussion _
and discussing who goes to Heaven,'' recalls the governor, who at
the time had religion very much on his mind.
 &HT;    Having dealt with a gathering drinking problem by abruptly
swearing off alcohol, he had vowed a renewed commitment to his
family and his faith. Bush pointed to the Bible: Only Christians
had a place in heaven.
 &HT;    ``I said, Mom, look, all I can tell you is what the New
Testament says. And she said, well, surely, God will accept others.
And I said, Mom, here's what the New Testament says. And she said,
OK, and she picks up the phone and calls Billy Graham. She says to
the White House operator, Get me Billy Graham.
 &HT;    ``I said, Mother, what are you doing?'' Bush continues,
chuckling at the memory. ``Seriously. And about two minutes later,
the phone rings, and it's Billy Graham, and Mother and I are on the
phone with Billy. And Mother explains the circumstances, and Billy
says, From a personal perspective, I agree with what George is
saying, the New Testament has been my guide. But I want to caution
you both. Don't play God. Who are you two to be God?''
 &HT;    For George W. Bush, a man who, in large part because of his
famous name, shows up in most polls these days as the very early
front-runner for a Republican presidential nomination battle that
is still more than a year away, it is an interesting story to
choose to relate.
 &HT;    Bush says it explains in part why he urged an end to ``name
calling'' this summer when a fracas broke out over his party's
decision to bar a gay Republican group from setting up a booth at
the GOP state convention.
 &HT;    ``There are some great admonitions in the Bible, talking about,
you know, don't try to take the speck out of your neighbor's eye
when you've got a log in your own,'' Bush says. ``I'm mindful of
that.''
 &HT;    And in his nearly four years as governor of the nation's
second-largest state, there has been strikingly little name-calling
from Bush. He talks constantly about being a ``unifier, not a
divider,'' and few things seem to make him happier than forging a
bipartisan consensus on some big bill.
 &HT;    He has grown so close to some Democratic lawmakers that he once
said there was ``no way in the world'' he could bring himself to
campaign against them.
 &HT;    Running now for his own re-election, Bush campaigns ferociously
in Democratic strongholds such as El Paso, where he breaks into
near-fluent Spanish before a delighted crowd at a ''Viva Bush!''
rally and where the Democratic mayor, Carlos Ramirez, introduces
him as ``the best governor of Texas that El Paso has ever had.''
 &HT;    For these and many other reasons, the 52-year-old eldest son of
former President George Bush is riding a broad wave of popularity
that, if current polls hold true, will carry him to a sweeping
victory this November as the first governor re-elected in Texas in
24 years, the first ever elected to back-to-back four-year terms.
 &HT;    Already, more than 100 Democratic officeholders have endorsed
him, including the state's lieutenant governor, a gruff political
veteran named Bob Bullock, who announced his support for Bush's
re-election even though he is godfather to the daughter of Bush's
Democratic opponent, Garry Mauro, the state land commissioner.
 &HT;    But if all this bodes well for Bush's re-election prospects in
Texas, and arguably for his prospects as a national candidate in a
general election, it also raises some obvious and perhaps
treacherous questions for the governor.
 &HT;    These are questions he would surely find tossed at him by
primary opponents if, in a step he is widely expected to take, he
runs for his father's old job. Just why do all those Democrats like
him so much? What kind of a Republican is he?
 &HT;    Why, for example, have some of his fiercest battles been with
his fellow Republicans? Some, including the state chairman of his
party at the time, are still furious with the governor over a tax
proposal he devised that would have radically reshaped the state
tax system, providing more money for some of the poorest public
schools in part by slapping new taxes on some of the biggest
industries.
 &HT;    Reticent on abortion, disinclined to denounce homosexuals, a
self-described fiscal conservative who is willing to spend money on
new programs such as a huge public-school reading initiative, Bush
does not seem to be offering the orthodoxy that some Republican
conservatives insist will be necessary in the party's candidate in
2000.
 &HT;    For all the speculation right now over whether Bush will want to
run for president _ speculation that has only seemed to grow more
fevered as scandal engulfs President Bill Clinton and threatens
Vice President Al Gore, the Democrat with the most obvious
presidential ambitions _ the more intriguing question may in time
turn out to be whether today's Republican Party wants someone like
Bush as its nominee.
 &HT;    Many party foot soldiers, still angry over the way they feel the
1996 nominee, Bob Dole, essentially ignored abortion, school prayer
and other issues they care most about, are determined to find a
candidate who will carry the torch _ or else. Many use Dole's name
as a verb, and not in a nice way _ ``We won't get Doled again,''
they say.
 &HT;    Bush insists that he is a cultural conservative and promotes
what he calls ``the responsibility era.'' But candidates are
already lining up to his right, including the deep-pocketed Steve
Forbes, the flat-tax fanatic of 1996 who this time around is making
an all-out pitch to social conservatives.
 &HT;    Forbes describes a ban on the procedure known as partial-birth
abortion as his foremost priority, ``the first step toward putting
abortion on the road to ultimate extinction in the United States of
America.''
 &HT;    Bush describes himself as ``pro-life,'' supports the
partial-birth abortion ban and pledges to propose a bill next year
requiring parental consent for a minor's abortion _ ``issues over
which we can make a difference,'' he says.
 &HT;    But on the basic question of the right of most women in most
circumstances to obtain an abortion, his position is that the
Supreme Court has already settled the law. And, to date, he has not
pledged any kind of crusade to sweep away those rulings; whether he
might do so in the heat of a primary campaign remains an open
question.
 &HT;    The Bush balancing act will be infinitely tougher to sustain in
the glare of the national stage. And how odd it seems, at least to
some, that so many Republicans might look to a man named George
Bush as their savior, given that George Bush lost it all for the
party just six years ago.
 -0- 
 &HT;    President Bush was at a steakhouse in Council Bluffs, Iowa, one
October day in 1994, reminiscing with some supporters from the old
days, when he excused himself to take a cellular telephone call.
The father was intently following the progress of two of his sons,
George and Jeb, in their respective gubernatorial campaigns against
savvy Democratic veterans in Texas and Florida, and new poll
numbers were just in.
 &HT;    ``He came back and he said, It looks like Jeb's OK, but I'm
worried about George,'' recalled Gordon C. James, a member of the
White House advance team in the Bush administration. ``He was upset
about it.''
 &HT;    Both races looked close, but like a lot of people, the president
saw evidence that Jeb (a nickname John Ellis Bush takes from his
initials) would pull it out over Lawton Chiles and that George's
race against a popular incumbent, Ann W. Richards, was just too
uphill a fight.
 &HT;    As things turned out, though, some invisible law of political
primogeniture seemed to kick in _ the older brother won and the
younger did not. (Late this summer, however, while George W. is
cruising toward re-election, Jeb is, according to the polls,
comfortably ahead too in his second bid for the governor's Mansion
in Tallahassee.)
 &HT;    Back in 1994, in seeing the softer-spoken, genial Jeb as the
more likely success in politics, people in the Bush family were
relying on much more than polling data. It's not that George W.
wasn't as determined to win as any Bush.
 &HT;    ``I think the major word to describe George W. circa 1993 and
the governorship was competitiveness,'' said Chase Untermeyer, a
longtime family friend and former presidential personnel director.
(Asked to compare George W. and his father in this regard,
Untermeyer said with a laugh: ``It is such a competitive family,
it's hard to make those shadings there. That's a driven
situation.'')
 &HT;    But if George W. Bush was driven, he was also known for a sharp
tongue and temper _ the ``Roman candle of the family ... and
likeliest to burn the fingers,'' as he is aptly described in
Richard Ben Cramer's ``What It Takes,'' the exhaustive account of
the 1988 presidential campaign.
 &HT;    When the Queen of England came to a White House dinner, Barbara
Bush sat George W. at the other end of the table, just to make sure
he didn't say anything undiplomatic to Her Majesty. He was the pit
bull brought in to deliver the bad news to the president's pit bull
of a chief of staff, John Sununu, when it was time for Sununu to
leave the White House.
 &HT;    And Bush, an unpaid adviser to his father, quarreled with
reporters during the 1992 campaign, frequently accusing them of
having a bias against the president.
 &HT;    Even Bush doesn't bother to deny that he was brusque in those
days.
 &HT;    ``I love my Dad, and it should not surprise you that I was a
fierce warrior on his behalf,'' he said, as his campaign plane
rumbled over the central Texas prairie one day this spring. ``And
if that ruffled people's feathers, so be it. There's a big
difference between being the son of a candidate and being the
candidate. And I understand the difference.''
 &HT;    And certainly, there was a difference by the time George W.
began his campaign for governor in 1994, a bid he contemplated four
years earlier but passed up, in part over concerns that running
with his father in the White House might look too opportunistic _
and be too embarrassing to all the Bushes if he lost.
 &HT;    Running against Ann W. Richards, the feisty and sharp-witted
incumbent who once famously derided his father as ``poor old
George,'' born with a ``silver foot in his mouth,'' Bush would seem
to have had ample reason to lose his cool.
 &HT;    In the course of the campaign, Richards called him ``Shrub,''
``that young Bush boy'' and ''some jerk,'' and joked that he was
``missing his Herbert'' (a reference to his father's two middle
names).
 &HT;    Richards frequently said that if Bush's name were George Walker,
without the Bush, no one would even take his campaign seriously _ a
point not without merit.
 &HT;    All the barbs and his prior reputation notwithstanding, Bush
turned in a truly remarkable performance. He did not lose his cool
at all, and at times he laughed right along with Richards,
basically telling voters that she sure was a funny lady, whom
everybody enjoyed, but that he came from a party and held to a
conservative philosophy that were more in line with what Texans
wanted in government. (Not that Bush wasn't out for revenge: As he
explained at the time, his strategy was to ``kill her with
kindness.'')
 &HT;    And for a man who had seemingly wandered through much of his 20s
and 30s, and who conceded that the main question surrounding him
was, ``What's the boy ever done?'' he ran a thoroughly disciplined
campaign.
 &HT;    Mindful that his father had lacked a coherent message in 1992,
Bush offered voters a precise, four-point plan for better
government: more control for local school districts, stricter
provisions for welfare recipients, tougher juvenile-justice laws
and reform of the state's tort laws. He never deviated from the
message. And while hardly the most scintillating set of political
themes ever developed, it allowed him to sidestep other issues,
particularly abortion.
 &HT;    Bush says the only painful episode from the campaign was a brief
flap over an interview he gave an Austin reporter about religion,
in which he reiterated his own personal belief that the path to
Heaven leads through acceptance of Christ as one's personal savior.
 &HT;    ``It was, of course, picked up and politicized _ you know, 'Bush
to Jews: Go to Hell,''' he recalls. ``It was very ugly. It hurt my
feelings.''
 &HT;    On election night, buoyed by the Republican surge that led to
the takeover of Congress, Bush won going away, 54 percent to 46
percent.
 &HT;    Jeb Bush, meanwhile, ran a campaign with a much sharper
conservative edge, speaking out against abortion and selecting a
Christian Coalition ``legislator of the year'' as his running mate.
To someone who briefly watched him campaign in 1994, the difference
this year is striking. He seems to have taken a page from his
brother, offering a much more upbeat message, reaching out to
minority groups, emphasizing education and greater ``compassion''
in state services.
 &HT;    Taking a break from a sweltering day of campaigning this summer
in West Palm Beach, Jeb Bush let out a tight laugh as he gave
credit to his big brother for proving himself ``the better
politician.''
 &HT;    ``He ran on four or five items or whatever it was, and he stayed
focused on that,'' Bush said. ``And that is a great lesson in
politics.''
 &HT;    Jeb Bush said he speaks to his brother about running for the
White House only ``in the contingent, in the conditional,'' but
adds that he has no doubt that his brother has ``the right stuff''
to be president.
 &HT;    And what if anyone tries to run to George W.'s right, by
emphasizing abortion or other specific social issues?
 &HT;    ``I think they'll fail,'' Jeb Bush said, ``because the broader
moral questions are the ones that concern the great majority of
people out there that fit this criteria of 'cultural
conservatives.' It is so sterile to talk about the things that the
press in this state wants to try to create, or my opponent.
Basically the same thing. There's all this Christian right, and
abortion. These are not the issues that drive people's concerns.
They want to know, how do they get the support to make sure their
children don't take drugs. They want their schools to be safe.
 &HT;    ``I'm very confident,'' he added, ``that George Bush will be

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The football player, a 275-pound offensive guard, was
pumping iron in preparation for the University of Washington's 1994
season. With a quarter-ton of weight on his shoulders, he was
squat-lifting _ raising and lowering the load in deep knee bends.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, he pitched forward, feeling a fusillade of searing
pains in his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard a series of popping in there,'' John DiSante recalls.
``I walked myself up, with help from my teammates, to the training
room. After five minutes of lying down, the whole thing tightened
up. They had to help me to my friend's truck and put me to bed.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, DiSante joined a reluctant fraternity. The Brothers
of the Back, you could call them. They're a growing legion of UW
players who have been felled by lower-back injuries in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   At least 15 players have been sidelined by back injuries since
1992 at the UW, with effects ranging from extended absences from
spring practice to surgery to a decision by some to give up
football.
</P>
<P>
   The P-I has documented in that six-year stretch nine players who
had surgery, three who gave up the game because of a back problem
and another three whose back injuries were treated with injections.
</P>
<P>
   The back-injury attrition has prompted a lawsuit against the
university, chipped away at player ranks already thinned by Pacific
10 Conference sanctions and left the UW without answers as to the
cause.
</P>
<P>
   Little hard evidence exists for comparison of back injuries at
the pro or college level. But it appears the incidence at
Washington has been greater than most other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Of eight Pac-10 schools other than the UW that responded to
inquiries by the P-I, only Oregon, with back surgeries to eight
players in six years, comes close to Washington. No other school
reported more than half the UW's combined number of surgeries and
players who quit football rather than have an operation.
</P>
<P>
   Both the NCAA and the National Football League Players
Association compile injury statistics, but neither provides an
average number of particular injuries per program. Randy Dick, who
gathers NCAA data, says lower-back injuries ranked only eighth in
practice- and game-related football categories in 1997, the
threshold being any restricted practice time.
</P>
<P>
   Independent medical and sports-medicine specialists interviewed
say it is difficult to put a number on how many back injuries might
be expected from football in a given time. But they are in general
agreement that 15 over six years is alarming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any statistics, but I do think that is higher
than you would expect,'' says Dr. Julian Bailes, a Florida
neurosurgeon who was a Pittsburgh Steelers team doctor for 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That seems awfully high,'' says Tom Miller, executive
consultant to the Joint Commission on Sports Medicine and Science
in Madison, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Presented with the UW numbers, one physician who treated a
former Husky player with a back injury said, ``That's amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Bramwell, a UW team physician, is skeptical of the depth
of the problem and unsure about the origin of the injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get a significant injury, we've always asked, `Where
did it happen? Why did it happen?''' Bramwell says. ``Is there
something being done out of the ordinary? We haven't been able to
pick that up.''
</P>
<P>
   Fomer UW tight end Cam Kissel, one player treated with epidural
cortisone injections for bulging disks, described a 1995 season of
pain coping with his condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had a little pinched sciatic nerve,'' Kissel says.
``But my whole left side started getting number and number. Five or
six days later, I couldn't move. It was awful.''
</P>
<P>
   Kissel believes he trained too hard for the season when he
should have rested. What followed was a series of left-side
injuries _ a sprained ankle, a pulled hamstring, a strained hip
flexor _ related to the back problem. Eventually, he recovered
without surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a risky thing when I think back,'' Kissel said. ``It was
a bad ordeal.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last year alone, this is the impact of back injuries at
Washington:
</P>
<P>
   _ Coming off back surgery in April 1997, offensive guard Benji
Olson played a limited role through the early part of the '97
season. Projected by many observers as a likely first-round NFL
draft choice had he stayed healthy, he fell to the fifth round in
April.
</P>
<P>
   _ Starting offensive tackle Mostafa Sobhi sat out his entire
senior season before finally undergoing surgery last December as
the post-script to his five-year UW career.
</P>
<P>
   _ Defensive end Josh Smith is a starter for the Huskies, but he
stayed out of morning practices during two-a-day drills with back
tightness after winter surgery.
</P>
<P>
   _ Junior Maurice Shaw, the starting tailback, missed spring
practice with disk surgery. He was sidelined by hamstring problems
in fall camp before reclaiming his No. 1 spot.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kurth Connell, a reserve offensive lineman, had a history of
hamstring problems believed related to a back condition that kept
him out of spring drills. He had epidural injections and says he is
now healthy but he is third string.
</P>
<P>
   _ Alvin Burleson Jr., a senior who lettered for the first time
last year for his work on special teams, is out indefinitely with
what he says has been diagnosed as a herniated disk.
</P>
<P>
   Bramwell is one of the few around the UW who will comment on the
back injuries. Because of a pending lawsuit by ex-linebacker Chad
Wright, football coach Jim Lambright, strength coach Rick Huegli
and athletic director Barbara Hedges declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Wright, who entered the UW in 1994, filed suit
alleging negligence and breach of contract and seeking unspecific
damages. Wright, 6-foot-3 and 240 pounds as a senior at Fife High
School, claims he was promised by UW recruiters that he would be
allowed to maintain his personal weight-training program. He says
that changed shortly after he arrived, when he was subjected to
high-weight exercises, including the power clean and one that
Wright's suit calls ``squat-'til-you-drop.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had heard a lot about colleges throwing heavy weights on
kids,'' says Wright, now out of football and completing a business
degree at Boston College. ``We understood that could lead to
injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright and other Huskies agree that a required offseason
weightlifting exercise was heavy squats, in which the lifter places
a barbell on his shoulders and does deep knee bends to build the
legs and chest. Instructors would record a single-lift best,
establishing a percentage of that as the goal for a low number of
repetitions.
</P>
<P>
   J.J. Hanson, a linebacker from Kent who had surgery in 1994 and
left the program after one season, recalls a personal experience
with squats.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're holding your breath while you're pushing, and you're
breaking blood vessels in your face,'' Hanson said. ``That's what
happens when you do squats really heavy. Freckles on dark brown
skin looked pretty unusual. They actually had me do a whole bunch
of neurological tests to make sure I didn't rupture anything in my
brain.''
</P>
<P>
   While there is no consensus _ and certainly no scientific
evidence _ on what is causing Washington's back injuries, some
victims suggest that such high-weight training, especially in
squat-lifting, is the origin of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it had more to do with weightlifting than anything
else,'' said Steve Hoffmann, a nose tackle whose surgery was in
1993. ``My best guess is the squat. It would probably be because
you're trying to go for the big numbers. The number (maximum lift)
was a big issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Says DiSante, ``I have to think it's in the weight room. When I
started coaching (high school), I noticed a lot of programs had
phased out squats altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was always a very high emphasis on how big is your squat
and how big is your power clean. Rick Huegli is an outstanding
strength coach, one of the best in the country. But I think it's
the nature of the exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   Current and former Huskies mention ``squat-'til-you-drop''
without prompting. But they say the practice was discontinued in
the mid-'90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say my freshman and sophomore years (1993-95), we were
required to do that,'' recalls defensive end Jason Chorak, who
finished at the UW last season. ``After that, we kind of got rid of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he says, some players embrace a hell-for-leather
mentality in the weight room.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get some people in there that want to go gung-ho, put all
this weight on,'' Chorak says. ``You get testosterone running
through the gym. Guys want to out-squat guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The UW's Bramwell contends there is nothing unusual about Husky
weight-training methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``People squat all over the place,'' Bramwell says, referring to
other programs. ``I'm not a big advocate of squat-lifting, for
knees, let alone backs. If I had my druthers, they wouldn't do
squats. But every program does squats of some sort.''
</P>
<P>
   At Washington, bigger players have been more vulnerable to back
injuries than those in the so-called ``skill'' positions. Of the 15
back injuries documented by the P-I, 12 occurred in linemen and
linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   Says Dr. Stephen Rice, a former UW physician and a researcher
now at the Jersey Shore Medical Center in Neptune, N.J., ``There
are studies that have shown forever and ever that this is a common
problem for linemen.''
</P>
<P>
   In a study published earlier this year, researchers at the
Robert Wood Johnson Medical School at Rutgers University concluded
that the lineman's routine of repeatedly hitting blocking sleds in
practice is likely to be one source of back injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, many linemen are heavy in the midsection, weighing 300
pounds or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linemen are probably going to have some predisposition because
of an inequality in lower-back strength and abdominal strength,''
says Dr. Vernon Williams, a neurologist at the Kerlan-Jobe
Orthopedic Clinic in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Add heavy squats to the equation, and some linemen might be a
back injury waiting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in a sitting position (which squat-lifting
approximates), you have higher pressures on the spinal canal,
higher than if you're standing or lying down,'' Williams says.
``That sitting position, particularly if there's heavy weight on
the back, may again play some role, predisposing the back to
injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Bramwell cautions that various lower-back conditions are
different, and in some instances, pre-existing or part of a family
history. Indeed, Keith Navidi, who developed a herniated disk in
1992, says he had a congenital condition. Defensive end Tyson
Pollman, whose UW career ended with an operation to fuse vertebrae
in 1995, says, ``I think bad backs might run in my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington's history of back injuries generates a question
fundamental to the sport. At what point does a reasonable pain
threshold conflict with the urgency of a big-time football program
_ especially one that has long prided itself on toughness?
</P>
<P>
   Phil Elmassian, a UW assistant in 1995, has coached at several
respected football schools _ Boston College, Syracuse, Virginia
Tech and Wisconsin. He talked once about the prevailing ethic at
the UW.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody practices like Washington,'' he said. He said it
admiringly.
</P>
<P>
   Former UW coach Jim Owens became renowned as the taskmaster of a
program that essentially ended Big Ten domination of the Rose Bowl
in the early '60s. A couple of years later, one of his players was
Lambright.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the raging work ethic that burned within Steve
Emtman _ the Eastern Washington farm boy who rose to become the No.
1 pick in the 1992 NFL draft _ provided a standard at the UW still
invoked today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, they ask for a big effort in the weight room, just
as they do on the field,'' says Bramwell, himself a scatback at
Washington under Owens. ``But I don't think it's a boot camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the push to compete at Washington, self-imposed and
other-directed, is formidable. Hoffmann concedes there were times
when he might have done more than was advisable, such as when
squat-lifting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back on it, I'm not sure,'' he says. ``Maybe I could
have done it in a little more progressive manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how much exercises like the power clean and squat were
stressed, DiSante says, ``It was a very, very big emphasis. It was
highly pushed and highly taught _ that this exercise directly
correlates to dominance on the field. `If you become good in these
areas, you'll become a dominant offensive lineman.'''
</P>
<P>
   Burleson, a reserve whose career is winding down, admits that
while his back was bothering him in spring practice, ``I didn't
want to whine to the coaches. I was trying to win a spot. I didn't
want to make excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than a liability, however, most players view that work
ethic as a source of pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what was always said around the program, that we work
harder than anybody else,'' says Benji Olson. ``But the workouts
I've got for the (Tennessee) Oilers are no different than they were
at the UW.''
</P>
<P>
   The back-injury attrition at Washington comes at a time when the
Huskies have had a low number of serious knee injuries, often seen
as the scourge of football players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe our lot is backs,'' said Bramwell, ``and not ACLs
(anterior cruciate knee ligaments).''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Madden, a Seattle attorney who is representing the UW in
the Wright lawsuit due for trial next June, says, ``The thing that
strikes me is to know what's normal. Unlike, say, knee injuries,
where people have studied them, and tried to correlate them to
natural turf, when you say a rash of back injuries ... compared to
what?''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps only those who have endured a back injury can fully
appreciate the suffering involved. While some feel pain in their
legs rather than in their backs, Hansen remembers migraine
headaches as well as back spasms. Damon Barry, a wide receiver who
had a bulging disk, says he made it through the 1992 season ``on
Advil, ice and treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollman remembers how, as he lay on a table to receive a
cortisone shot, ``They'd stick that big old needle _ it didn't have
a point on it _ they rammed it in there, worked its way in there
until it got to the disk. Had to be every single nerve just lit on
fire. I had no idea how much pain I was going to have to go
through.''
</P>
<P>
   DiSante was home for Christmas in 1994, when his misery became
apparent to those around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents noticed me lying on the floor,'' he recalls. ``It
was like a really toiling effort to get up. I was popping a lot of
Advil. They were like, `This is ridiculous.'
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom is in orthopedics. She sent me to a doctor in Southern
California. He did the MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and said,
`Hey, you've got some bulging disks. You've got one that could
herniate. My recommendation to you is to stop playing.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all I needed to hear. I wanted to play, but life is too
short to be a cripple.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, some of the 15 Huskies are whole again, some are not.
Many say they are pain-free. Hanson, on the other hand, says he's
like a ``rusty hinge.'' He can't sit through a movie without
standing to relieve the stress.
</P>
<P>
   And some are still playing football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping one day it'll click and won't hurt anymore,'' said
Josh Smith. ``I'm waiting for that day.''

CUSTOMERS GRANTED MICROSOFT ITS 90 PERCENT MARKET SHARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Barksdale, president of Netscape Communications, asked the
rhetorical question in March at the Senate Judiciary Committee. How
many spectators had computers? Hands went up. How many didn't have
Windows? Hands went down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gentlemen, that's a monopoly,'' Barksdale said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft opponents packaged this testimony into a film, which
was shown in Seattle last month at a conference on antitrust law.
It was a tub-thumper, but Payton Smith, a partner at Davis Wright
Tremaine, spotted its weakness. ``I would have been more moved by
that film if I hadn't seen so many competitors in it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton made the same point: that the complaints are
from competitors, not customers. He called the case ``a private
lawsuit being pursued by the government of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference sponsors, the Competitive Enterprise Institute
and the Washington Institute Foundation, are both inclined to favor
Microsoft. But they had speakers from both sides on the central
questions: Is Microsoft a monopoly? Is it bad? Should the
government attack it?
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's critics focused on its conduct. Microsoft, they
said, is muscling into cable TV, banking and television _ even
political magazines. ``Consumers don't like the idea of a single
firm controlling everything under the sun,'' said James Love,
executive director of Ralph Nader's Consumer Project on Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's supporters responded that the company hasn't been
able to control everything. That it has 90 percent shares in a few
markets means not that its conduct is bad, but that its products
are good. ``Products that aren't any good fail,'' said Jonathan
Zuck, director of the Association for Competitive Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Even monopoly itself does not imply high prices, they argued.
Stan Liebowitz, professor of managerial economics at the University
of Texas, said the price of Microsoft Word fell even as its market
share on the Macintosh rose to 100 percent. Microsoft had a
monopoly, he said, ``but it didn't act like a monopolist.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides claimed the mantle of competition. The anti-Microsoft
side had a genteel, supervised version of it, with a lot of little
guys, none of them playing to win. The other side gloried in
players who slugged it out.
</P>
<P>
   The slug-it-outers sometimes shrank from stating their case
plainly. I would begin such a case with an admission that Microsoft
is a monopoly _ as much as anyone is ever likely to get in an open
market.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's near-monopoly mainly reflects its CEO's skill in
strategy, not tactics. Bill Gates was the first to see that we
computer buyers are herd animals who yearn to own the same
technology as those around us. And for a good reason: We remember
what happened to our TRS-80s, Osbornes, Commodores and other
Studebakers of silicon history.
</P>
<P>
   Our rush to one technology is called a ``network effect.''
Critics advance it as an argument against Microsoft: The technology
that wins might not be the best. But that argument justifies what?
A law against network effects? An Endangered Technologies Act?
</P>
<P>
   Network effects reflect consumer choice. Microsoft has a 90
percent market share because we customers have granted it.
</P>
<P>
   It is a rational choice. We get the widest choice in
applications by accepting a standard operating system. And why not?
The operating system means little to us. It is useless by itself.
It is not so much of a product at all, said Yale University law
professor George Priest, but a kind of language.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Microsoft's critics sounded as if they wished that
language would be public property. But it isn't. It was created by
private investment and protected by copyright. The government is
not going to buy it, and Priest said, ``We can't think of how to
break up the language of Windows in a way that makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Should government regulate it? The Justice Department has given
us a sample of its brilliance in that department. Last Christmas,
it was demanding that Windows 95 be offered in a disabled edition,
with the Internet Explorer icon taken off, in order to promote
consumer choice.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative way of dealing with Microsoft's monopoly is to
leave it to us. If Microsoft gets oppressive, we can all gang up on
it and heave it out. We heaved out our vinyl LPs. We jettisoned
Beta VCRs and eight-track tapes. We knocked off Nintendo as No. 1
in video games. Right now we can choose Apple's iMac, and tomorrow,
perhaps something even better.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever gives us a compelling reason to abandon Windows will
make billions. Until then, the billions go to the owners of
Windows.

   OIL-ROYALTIES (Washington) _ Legislation sponsored by Sen.
Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and opposed by oil state senators would

49ERS OWNER APPARENTLY WON'T BE INDICTED IN LOUISANA CASINO DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Federal prosecutors looking into alleged
corruption in the awarding of Louisiana riverboat casino licenses
have evidently decided not to indict San Francisco 49ers owner
Edward DeBartolo Jr. on racketeering charges, although he remains a
target of the investigation, DeBartolo's lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have told defense attorneys that they plan to indict
former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards, his son and an associate under
the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, according
to a published report.
</P>
<P>
   The federal law, known as RICO, was enacted in 1970 to attack
organized crime, but its scope has been greatly expanded since
then. Prosecutors believe Edwards, a Democrat, is the key figure in
a conspiracy to influence the awarding of Louisiana riverboat
casino licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Edwards, his son, Steven, and their friend, Cecil
Brown, have been invited to Washington to meet with members of the
Justice Department's Organized Crime and Racketeering Division to
discuss their cases.
</P>
<P>
   Aubrey Harwell, the Nashville attorney who is representing
DeBartolo, said Tuesday he would not attend that meeting. The
government's invitation to him had been withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Harwell said, DeBartolo ``is still a target'' of
the U.S. attorney's office in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Just what DeBartolo could be charged with has never been made
public, but his 1997 deal for Louisiana's last riverboat casino
license does not appear to be part of the criminal enterprise
prosecutors believe dated back to 1991.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Times-Picayune of New Orleans, federal
prosecutors outlined their RICO case against the Edwardses and
Brown during a conference call on Monday. The five-part indictment
will focus on a seven-year period from 1991, the year before
Edwards was elected to his fourth term as governor, to the present,
the newspaper, citing an anonymous source, said. The indictment is
expected before Oct. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy U.S. Attorney Jim Letten declined to clarify the status
of the case against DeBartolo, who was notified in November that he
was the target of an investigation that could lead to his
indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have been looking into the awarding of Louisiana's
last riverboat casino license to DeBartolo in March 1997, shortly
after he paid Edwards $400,000 in cash. Edwards has said the money
was paid for legal and lobbying work he did for DeBartolo, and he
has repeatedly noted that he was out of office at the time the
license was awarded.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo relinquished the license in June after testifying
before a Louisiana grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo's legal troubles have thrown the 49ers franchise into
turmoil and clouded the team's plan for a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Mayor Willie Brown is scheduled to meet with 49ers
interim President Larry Thrailkill and NFL Commissioner Paul
Tagliabue to discuss the stadium, which is the designated site for
the 2003 Super Bowl.

   WELFARE-LOCKHEED _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ For every Palm Beach
County welfare recipient that walks through the door, Lockheed
Martin IMS, an arm of the aerospace company, stands to get paid
$2,544. That price covers everything from the recipient taking an
orientation class to finding a job and keeping it for six months.
If the job pays $6.56 or above, Lockheed Martin makes even more _
some $200,000 in bonuses. At the corporate level, welfare reform
isn't just about people _ but profits. Two years ago, when Florida
lawmakers required all able-bodied welfare recipients to find work
by Oct. 1, 1998, or lose their benefits, Lockheed Martin staked its
claim where few big companies were willing to venture: moving poor
people from welfare to work. With the promise of providing cheaper
and better services, Lockheed Martin held up its defense industry
reputation like a resume, hoping to impress state governments
charged with changing welfare as the nation knew it. (Cooper, Palm
Beach Post). 30. WITH GRAPHICS.

   WELFARE-TAXPAYERS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ While taxpayers may
think welfare reform meant they'd save money, Florida is paying
more than ever before because of the array programs used to move
people from welfare to work, state records show. Congress estimates
that Florida's welfare block grant won't decline until the year
2002, six years after President Clinton signed legislation making
welfare reform the law of the land. (Cooper, Palm Beach Post). 22.
WITH GRAPHICS.
</P>
<P>
   WELFARE-ROLLS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Since 1996, when welfare
reform began, Florida's rolls have shrunk about 60 percent and
nobody knows exactly why. Officials do know about a quarter of
those recipients are back on welfare and won't be subject to the
Oct. 1 deadline. Their clocks start from the day they returned to
the system. (Cooper, Palm Beach Post). 15.

<P>
   WELFARE-FAMILY _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Kalisha Powell is
feeling the effects of welfare reform. On Oct. 1, this single
mother of six will experience its sting when her benefits end
because she hasn't found a job in two years. Powell will be among
the 2,000 families statewide projected to lose their welfare checks
next month. She and her children are currently living in the Rock
Garden Apartments, a shelter for homeless families run by the
Center for Family Services. The agency will house Powell for only
30 days because it operates on an emergency basis. (Cooper, Palm
Beach Post). 16. WITH PHOTO.

WHITHER THE START OF THE HUDSON? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRED LeBRUN  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a flourish more poetic than precise, maps announce that
below the confluence of the Henderson Lake outlet and babbling
Calamity Brook, the Hudson River finally earns its name.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly where, none states. I've seen dozens of maps, and they
all fudge on this, but at least they all make the same fudge.
</P>
<P>
   This is not, however, the recognizable Hudson of the roaring
gorge below. Or the placid waterway that doubles as the Champlain
canal, or the moody arm of the sea beyond the federal dam at Troy.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it still bears a remarkable resemblance to the Calamity
Brook we followed down from the pond of the same name, just below
Lake Colden.
</P>
<P>
   The newly minted Hudson is about 15 feet wide, big on boulders
and light on actual babble _ except after heavy rains or melt-off.
There's little depth and no channel. Canoeing is impossible, but
the water does appear crystal clear and unsullied.
</P>
<P>
   In the 7-mile descent from Lake Tear of the Clouds it seems
we've hiked out of timeless wilderness into somebody's Saturday
night dance. There are blatant signs all around of civilization and
the busy hands and feet of man. The Henderson outlet dam is
obviously engineered, made of uniformly crushed gray stone. The
15-foot-wide concrete spillway is notched for a steel gate. Unlike
the steep-pitched dark trail down from Marcy, now we have a
flatlander's delight.
</P>
<P>
   The trail is a wide, cleared road fit for jogging, and the grass
on it is trampled from hikers. The greens of the canopy around us
are light and airy from high shrubs, cherry, maple and beech. There
isn't a brooding spruce to be seen. The sun dances on Henderson
Lake and the low rolling hills around it.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the lack of cottages along the shore, it struck me
this could be a scene somewhere in north Jersey. The second
foil-lined gum wrapper I spotted supported this. Not 500 yards from
Henderson Lake spillway is the Grand Central Station of High Peaks
hiking, the Upper Works parking lot. Well, maybe Penn Station.
</P>
<P>
   The Adirondack Loj parking lot on the other side of Marcy is
Grand Central, but it's not unusual for 30 or 40 vehicles to be
lining up at the Department of Environmental Conservation-run Upper
Works parking area, trailhead to Colden, Henderson, Indian Pass and
points north, east and west. Busy, busy, even in winter.
</P>
<P>
   If Lake Tear is the spiritual source of the Hudson, offering a
glimpse at its soul, then the spill from Henderson and especially
the scene around the Upper Works parking area is the symbolic
beginning of the bustling river that flows past the World Trade
Center. All business and human activity, of a sort.
</P>
<P>
   Separate streams combining into a single river. One, fragile,
born of the wilderness but drawing from great renewable strength.
The other a pliable conduit for commerce, driven by the here and
now and human need. A furnace waiting to be fired. A duality of
purpose, origin, identity, so often in conflict, is evident from
the beginning. Downriver, I'm anticipating we'll see the upper hand
going to commerce and its consequences, good and bad. But not here
at the Upper Works.
</P>
<P>
   Because except for the hikers' cars in the parking lot, any
signs of human activity are from an age long passed. Dead men's
hands. This place is a ghost town, quietly rotting away. As bizarre
a sight as any in these mountains. Mature trees growing up through
half a dozen or so large buildings, some not used in more than a
century. At one time, 400 workers lived here with their families,
making iron and using an acre of wood a day to do it. Now the
eerily quiet and collapsing village is a cemetery full of memorials
to an outdated process and the fragility of the here and now.
</P>
<P>
   The river, back away from the village, appears totally
unaffected. Score this one for solitude.

   ``SPECIAL AGENT ED LIMATO.'' From W magazine. Ed Limato's
clients do have last names. It's just that they tend not to need
them. Most of the planet is familiar enough with Mel, Denzel, Liam,
Winona, Goldie, Michelle. Outside of Hollywood, Limato's name is
unlikely to be recognized. Within the Industry, however, it has
absolute resonance. Limato is one of a handful of talent agents at
the top of the totem pole. An interview.

   Tribes of the Iroquois Nation believe that the Finger Lakes were
formed when the Creator's hands raked across the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Geologists say that eons ago, glaciers lumbered past a slab of
wet cement we now call central New York State and couldn't resist.
In any case, nature provided 11 fingers, perhaps because it would
take more than two hands to count all the region's charms.
</P>
<P>
   The supply of wineries to visit, inns to settle down in and
historic Main Streets to stroll in the Finger Lakes seems
inexhaustible _ especially in the fall foliage season. So an autumn
tour of the region requires some choices.
</P>
<P>
   One suggestion: stick to the biggest lakes, Seneca and Cayuga,
which are in the middle and are each about 35 miles long. Views
from either side of these, with little sightseeing boats passing
between sharply rising hillsides, conjure up a miniature Lake
Geneva (or, in the case of 632-foot-deep Seneca, Loch Ness).
</P>
<P>
   Along 19th-century streets in towns like Geneva, Corning,
Hammondsport and Skaneateles, old brick storefronts have lost some
of their right angles. But they wear their years with dignity and
an honesty typical of a region where farm stands work on the honor
system.
</P>
<P>
   Foliage season is usually mid-September to mid-October. For
updates, call Finger Lakes National Forest at (607) 546-4470. The
region is about six hours from New York City via the Thruway to
Exit 16, and Route 17.
 &UR; EVENTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Through Nov. 1, ``Warp and Weft,'' Navajo weaving from the 1870s
to the 1970s, will be at the Rockwell Museum, 111 Cedar St.,
</P>
<P>
   Corning. The 1893 red-brick Romanesque Revival building has a
large permanent collection of Western art, including Remington and
Bierstadt, and more than 2,000 pieces of art glass by Frederick
Carder, a founder of Steuben Glass. Open Monday to Saturday 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m., Sunday noon to 5 p.m. Admission: $5, seniors $4.50, ages
6 to 17 $2.50; (607) 937-5386.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Langhorne Clemens spent summers in Elmira and is buried
there in Woodlawn Cemetery. What would Mark Twain have thought
about a popular Elmira activity: flying without a motor?
</P>
<P>
   The surrounding flat lands are blessed with thermals ideal for
gliders. Sept. 19 is Community Soaring Day and Kite-Citement at the
Harris Hill Gliderport, off Route 17. Glider rides are $30 (free
for disabled children), or learn kite-making; (607) 734-3128.
</P>
<P>
   This one is a real no-brainer: the Great Canandaigua Scarecrow
Contest. About 75 locally made straw persons compete to see which
can scare the most birds off Main Street in Canandaigua, from Sept.
26 through Oct. 10. Free; (716) 396-0300.
</P>
<P>
   The Buckwheat Harvest Festival, at the Yates County Fairgrounds
in Penn Yan, will feature rides, food and fireworks Sept. 25 to 27.
Hours: 4 to 11 p.m. Sept. 25, 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Sept. 26 (when
Billy Ray Cyrus sings) and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sept. 27. Admission:
$6; (800) 868-9283.
 &UR; SIGHTSEEING &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sun-washed hillsides of the Finger Lakes were discovered by
winemakers in the mid-1800s. Now, there are dozens of vintners
along the major lakes, which provide a tempering effect on the cold
climate. Whites and sparkling wines are the region's forte.
</P>
<P>
   Route 14 on Seneca's western shore is lined with wineries, but
off the main road, Castel Grisch on Route 28 above Watkins Glen,
offers a less-trafficked view of the lake amid Rhineland trappings.
Open daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; (607) 535-9614.
</P>
<P>
   On Seneca's east shore, Wagner Winery, Route 414 in Lodi, has
beer tastings, too. Open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily, (607) 582-6450.
</P>
<P>
   For wine-tour maps, contact the Seneca Lake Winery Association,
(315) 536-9996; the Cayuga Wine Trail, (800) 684-5217, or the Keuka
Lake Wine Route, (800) 440-4898.
</P>
<P>
   The views of the cascades in Watkins Glen State Park are
literally breathtaking, if you start the 1.5-mile trail from the
bottom, on Franklin Street in Watkins Glen.
</P>
<P>
   As you ascend the 832 steps to the top of the 650-foot glen, you
pass along, over and under 18 waterfalls (runoff from the rocky
walls can leave the trail slick). Park on village streets and walk
in free. A shuttle ($2.50) lets you start at the top; (607)
535-4511.
</P>
<P>
   Less splashy are the falls in Fillmore Glen State Park _ named
after a not-so-splashy President, Millard Fillmore. A reproduction
of the tiny rudimentary cabin in which he was born in 1800, five
miles away, is off the parking lot ($4 a car). The 1.8-mile trail
through the surrounding woods should afford some great leaf
watching. Open dawn to dusk on Route 38 in Moravia; (315) 497-0130
</P>
<P>
   Among the floating excursions for leaf fanciers are Captain
Bill's Seneca Lake Cruises, aboard the Stroller IV, a jaunty boat
from the 1930's decked out in Philippine mahogany.
</P>
<P>
   In foliage season, 50-minute tours depart every other hour
starting at 11 a.m. Fare: $7.50, ages 2 to 12, $3.50. Boats leave
from the foot of Franklin Street in Watkins Glen; (607) 535-4541.
</P>
<P>
   The modest-sized Sciencenter, 601 First St., just off Route 13
north of Ithaca, is full of hands-on displays that will teach and
entertain young children. Your little Indiana Jones can dig for
real fossils. Open Tuesday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday
noon to 5. Admission: $4.50, ages 4 to 12 $3.50; (607) 272-0600.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let memories of all those duplicate housewarming gifts
keep you from the Corning Museum of Glass and Glass Center, 151
Centerway, Corning, (607) 974-8271. A head of Amenhotep II of
Egypt, made between 1436 and 1411 B.C., is the earliest known glass
portrait, and a cut-glass table from 1878 weighs more than half a
ton. There's not a casserole in sight until you reach the gift
shop. Open daily 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $6, seniors $5, ages 6
to 17 $4.
</P>
<P>
   The Farm Sanctuary, eight miles west of Watkins Glen, off Route
23, is a 175-acre refuge for abused livestock. It's filled with
cows, chickens and pigs. Admission is free; guided tours on
weekends in September and October cost $2, ages 4 to 12, $1; (607)
583-2225.
 &UR; WHERE TO STAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Radisson, 125 Denison Parkway East, Corning, (607) 962-5000,
fax (607) 962-4166, looks like a concrete bunker plopped at the
foot of graceful Market Street. But the 177-room hotel, with an
indoor pool, is a stroll from the Corning and Rockwell museums.
Rooms are comfortable and contemporary, with about half redone last
winter in dark-green tones. Rates from $139.
</P>
<P>
   True to its name, the Ramada Geneva Lakefront, 41 Lakefront
Drive, Geneva, (800) 990-0907, fax (315) 789-4351, is on the
northern tip of Seneca Lake. Its 148 rooms are most notable for the
views (91 face the water). There's an indoor pool. Rates: $109 to
$139 till Oct. 1, $89 to $109 after.
</P>
<P>
   Budget: For a traditional roadside motor lodge, try the
Longhouse Lodge Motel, Route 14 at Abrams Road, Watkins Glen,
telephone and fax (607) 535-2565. The 25 rooms were redone last
summer, and 21 have rockers outside the doors to enjoy the hillside
Seneca Lake view, while 4 are higher up the hill in a separate
house. A VCR, with movies, rents for $5. Rates: $68 to $88, with
Continental breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Similar is the Best Western Marshall Manor, Route 14,
Horseheads, telephone and fax (607) 739-3891, conveniently situated
between Seneca Lake and Elmira. Families can make fast getaways in
the morning since the 40 clean, simple rooms have sinks inside and
outside the bathrooms. Rates: $63 to Oct. 10, $52 after, with
Continental breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury: Geneva on the Lake, 1001 Lochland Road (Route 14),
Geneva, (800) 343-6382, fax (315) 789-0322, is modeled after an
Italian Renaissance villa, with 26 rooms and 4 more in a
contemporary town house. A parterre garden leads to the lakeside
pool.
</P>
<P>
   The Library Suite, decorated with Stickley furniture, has a
coffered ceiling and fireplace, and the shelves lining the walls
contain books from the collection of the estate's original owners.
Rates: $133 to $525, with Continental breakfast, bottle of wine and
fruit basket.
</P>
<P>
   A soft-pink wedding cake of a house built in 1851 is now the
Rose Inn, 813 Auburn Road (Route 34), Ithaca; (607) 533-7905, fax
(607) 533-7908. A spiral staircase of Honduran mahogany coils
majestically up to a cupola.
</P>
<P>
   Among the main house's 15 rooms, decorated with period
furniture, are four suites with whirlpool baths. The grounds
include a pretty little formal garden. Rates: $100 to $275, with
full breakfast.
 &UR; WHERE TO EAT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cafe Alfresca, 45 Shethar St., in Hammondsport, at the southern
end of Keuka Lake, overlooks the village green and its gingerbread
bandstand, an ideal place to enjoy one of the delicious warm panini
sandwiches, soups, salads or thin pizzas _ all $4 to $4.95. If
there is an autumn chill, move inside to a rocking chair and sip a
giant cappuccino ($3.25).
</P>
<P>
   Works by local artists adorn the walls, and there's live music
Saturday nights (open 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. other days). A meal for
two with drinks: $20; (607) 569-2009.
</P>
<P>
   Framboise, 9 East Genesee St., is an airy storefront with tall
windows looking out onto the center of Skaneateles, southwest of
Syracuse. Dried and fresh flower arrangements adorn the tables in
the two dining areas.
</P>
<P>
   Appetizers include spring rolls in orange-cranberry sauce with a
pile of steamed julienned vegetables; cioppino, a fish stew made
with tomatoes; or chicken Maasdam _ a breast stuffed with
asparagus, roasted peppers and cream cheese and wrapped in puff
pastry _ are among the entrees. Three-course dinner for two with
wine: about $65; (315) 685-7196.
</P>
<P>
   Tables in the publike London Underground, 69 East Market St.,
Corning, are amply spaced. Get past the endless menu descriptions _
``local ostrich sirloin with stone-ground mustard glaze and Vidalia
onion compote,'' for example, followed by ``basil-infused chicken
breast with sauce fines herbes, bowtie pasta and a trio of sauteed
peppers'' _ and the food speaks for itself. Dinner for two with
wine: $75; (607) 962-2345.
</P>
<P>
   The Sherwood Inn, a stately historic inn at 26 West Genesee St.,
Skaneateles, has a formal dining room and a tavern; in the latter,
the Fruit Fantasia ($8.95) is a generous pile of fresh fruit,
chicken or tuna salad, date-nut bread and sherbet; in the dining
room, the accent is on standards like steak and prime rib, with
dinner for two with wine about $90; (315) 685-3405.
</P>
<P>
   While dining in the rear sun room of the Thendara Inn and
Restaurant, 4356 East Lake Road (Route 364), Canandaigua, we saw
one couple wed beside the lake, while a few tables away, another
toasted their 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Among the appetizers is brie en croute with portobello
mushrooms; for main courses, there's herb-encrusted swordfish with
ginger lemongrass sauce or marinated grilled chicken breast with
gazpacho salsa. Addlepated service was a discordant note. Dinner
for two with wine: $90 to $100. Closed Monday and Tuesday after
Oct.1. Reservations recommended; (716) 394-4868.

<P>
   Cafe Alfresca, 45 Shethar St., in Hammondsport, at the southern
end of Keuka Lake, overlooks the village green and its gingerbread
bandstand, an ideal place to enjoy one of the delicious warm panini
sandwiches, soups, salads or thin pizzas _ all $4 to $4.95. If
there is an autumn chill, move inside to a rocking chair and sip a
giant cappuccino ($3.25).
</P>
<P>
   Works by local artists adorn the walls, and there's live music
Saturday nights (open 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. other days). A meal for

</P>
<P>

<P>
   Appetizers include spring rolls in orange-cranberry sauce with a

<P>
   Tables in the publike London Underground, 69 East Market St.,

``local ostrich sirloin with stone-ground mustard glaze and Vidalia
onion compote,'' for example, followed by ``basil-infused chicken
breast with sauce fines herbes, bowtie pasta and a trio of sauteed
peppers'' _ and the food speaks for itself. Dinner for two with
wine: $75; (607) 962-2345.
</P>
<P>
   The Sherwood Inn, a stately historic inn at 26 West Genesee St.,

 &HT;    The Internet is finally a viable tool for enthusiasts who like
to plan their own travel. Many Web-based services are now capable
of accepting credit cards for purchases, and the proliferation of
faster modems has meant that glacial waits for downloads are now
largely a thing of the past.
 &HT;    Here are some of the better sites around for those who want to
get somewhere fast.
 &HT;    ----
 &HT;    There's been a proliferation of Web-based travel agencies, many
of which are now routinely used by business travelers. But leisure
travelers who are savvy enough can use them to their own advantage
and sidestep airline reservationists and conventional travel
agents.
 &HT;    Virtually all of them have some sort of fare-finder that enables
the traveler to enter flights and come up with fare and carrier
options in short order. In addition to airfare, the following sites
allow the traveler to book a car rental and a hotel as well.
 &HT;    Start with BizTravel.com (www.biztravel.com), which has become a
favorite of business travelers. It allows user to create very
detailed traveling profiles of themselves and manage their
frequent-flier programs. It has a good, fast fare-finder and has a
wide-ranging data base of hotels and car-rental agencies as well.
 &HT;    Microsoft Expedia (www.expedia.com) is one of the best-known
on-line travel agencies around, with a good fare finder and a
pretty sophisticated search engine that allows users to look for
the best-priced flights and scroll through scheduled flights
easily.
 &HT;    Flifo (www.flifo.com) makes it easy to set up a detailed
itinerary. The fare-finder is speedy and the free ticket delivery
is a bonus.
 &HT;    Preview Travel (www.previewtravel.com), the preferred travel
service for America On-Line (AOL) members, is also one of the best
and the fastest for leisure travelers. Users have access to a
responsive fare-finder that ranks flights not only by price but
also provides aircraft model and up-to-the-minute availability of
seats in all classes.
 &HT;    The Trip.com (www.thetrip.com) is an all-purpose travel site
that allows users to not only book flights but to track them as
well. Waiting for someone to arrive at the local airport? This site
gives real-time locations of flights enroute, something no airline
toll-free number can do.
 &HT;    Travelocity (www.travelocity.com) was one of the first on-line
travel agencies and is linked to SABRE, one of the systems used by
professional travel agents. But it's easier to use than its parent
and is quite good at finding low fares.
 &HT;    There's also 1travel.com (1travel.com), which has a somewhat
less sophisticated fare-finder than the others and still requires a
phone call to complete a transaction. What makes this site
noteworthy is that it provides consolidator flights, a boon for
anyone looking for discounted airfares to Europe and Asia.
 &HT;    For hotels alone, two discount hotel brokers who can help
travelers ease the sting of big-city hotel prices are Hotel
Reservations Network (www.180096hotel.com) and Quikbook
(www.quikbook.com).
 &HT;    Some of the airline's own Web sites are useful for rooting out
deals. The leading site must be American Airlines' (www.aa.com),
which began offering Net SAAver fares a couple of years ago. These
are last-minute, round-trip deals that are posted every week to
subscribers via e-mail. International deals are listed on Mondays,
domestic deals on Wednesdays. The e-mail subscription is free.
 &HT;    This site is a clearinghouse for unsold tickets, most of which
originate at the airline's hub cities of Chicago, Dallas and Miami.
These deals are good for long weekend travel from either Thursday
to Monday or Friday to Monday or Tuesday.
 &HT;    American also offers discounted first-class fares every week and
usually has additional short-lived deals from American Airlines
Vacations.
 &HT;    Other airline sites worth a look are U.S. Airways
(www.airways.com) and Continental (www.flycontinental.com) for
weekly e-mail specials.
 &HT;    Both TWA (www.twa.com) and Cathay Pacific
(www.cathaypacific(TILDE)air.com) send them out periodically. The
latter, of course, still has what is probably the greatest airfare
deal of the year, an $899 Asia Pass that includes round-trip
airfare from New York to Hong Kong and unlimited travel to the 18
cities that Cathay serves within a 30-day period, including Bali
(Indonesia), Bangkok (Thailand) and Seoul (Korea).
 &HT;    For anyone who's contemplating mountain biking in the Lake
Geneva region of Switzerland or hiking in the Rockies, there's
GORP, the Great Outdoors Recreation Pages (www.gorp.com), with
traveler's tales about biking, hiking and fishing and listings of
dozens of adventure-travel companies.
 &HT;    Thinking about going around the world? High Adventure Travel
(www.highadv.com) offers dozens of sample itineraries and allows
users to plan their own world jaunt on-line.
 &HT;    Council Travel (www.ciee.org) and Air Brokers International
(www.airbrokers.com) are also good sources for would-be
round-the-world travelers _ or for anyone who'd like to dream about
such a trip.

 &HT;    
 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    What could possibly be more romantic than an island cruise on
board a Greek caique?
 &HT;    Beverly Shaver of El Cerrito, Calif., and her 32 fellow
Elderhostelers visualized that the tiny vessel scheduled to take
them around the Aegean to explore the fabled Cyclades Islands would
be a combination of the Bounty (as in Mutiny) and a Sultan's
barque. Even the ship's name _ the Zeus III _ conjured idyllic
images.
 &HT;    ``Of course the reality, when we first glimpsed her bobbing at
the Pireaus mooring, resembled neither Bounty nor barque,'' Shaver
says. ``One-hundred-sixteen feet long, she was a chunky blend of
Manhattan Island ferry and tugboat-with-mast painted red and
white.''
 &HT;    From Piraeus, the port for Athens, the Zeus set a course due
east, sailing on a serene sea _ no seasick stomachs here. Forty
nautical miles and four hours out, it glided into snug St. Nicholas
Bay on the tranquil little island of Kea.
 AN UNTAINTED WORLD  
 &HT;    Modern Kea is a typical Cycladic village with small sugarcube
houses lining narrow, winding, stone-paved streets. Here one can
find the unspoiled little Grecian paradise always promised in
brochures, Shaver says, and which is so seldom delivered. Here, as
on almost all the Cyclades, are 2,000-year-old ruins and sparkling
beaches for snorkeling and swimming.
 &HT;    The passengers' first dinner aboard the Zeus consisted of
chicken broth thickened with rice and eggs, prawns with rice,
artichokes and broad beans in oil with dill and lemon. The feast
was topped off with honey-and-nut cake with custard filling.
 &HT;    These Elderhostelers were now pretend-patrons of the Zeus'
gourmet restaurant. A deckhand named Demos, who only hours earlier
was seen wearing greasy overalls and cursing a jammed winch, was
transformed into a dignified, cummerbunded waiter. Passengers and
crew would treat one another with the formal politeness due their
respective, changeable roles.
 &HT;    Captain Voul-garikis urged everyone to try Retsina, the famed
liqueur. But of course, they agreed, eager to have the whole
glorious Greek experience.
 &HT;    Retsina, Shaver found, was clearly an acquired taste.
``Retsina,'' said the group wag, ``tastes like pure turpentine
that's been strained through a fisherman's sock.''
 &HT;    A pattern was quickly established. Zeus passengers were hooked
on listening to lectures, reading Greek novels and exploring the
wonders of the island. Watching the sun set became a ritual, and
dogged efforts were made to master Greek dancing.
 THE SALON CLASSROOM  
 &HT;    In the mornings, the salon became a classroom where
anthropologist Akis Papataxiarchis held forth for several hours
each day before reaching the next port.
 &HT;    Staying almost always in sight of land, the Zeus scudded from
island to island _ places such as Tinos, Delos, Ios, Mykonos,
Naxos, Paros, Thira.
 &HT;    Sleeping in ports through the nights, Elderhostelers saw the
darkness studded with flickering lanterns as fishermen speared
octopus and squid off the rocks. They wakened each morning to the
cries of gulls, the clop of mules on quayside planks and the sound
of limp octopuses being slapped against wharf pilings by young
Greek boys working to tenderize the meat, Shaver says.
 &HT;    Delos, one of the smallest of the Cyclades, was the most famous
of all in ancient times. Legendary birthplace of Apollo, it
attracted hordes of pilgrims bearing gifts and became the treasury
for the Delian League.
 &HT;    Now Delos stands deserted and uninhabited, strewn with the
bleached bones of ruined temples, mansions, baths and splendid
mosaics _ all guarded by the celebrated lean and hungry stone
lionesses.
 &HT;    On picturesque Mykonos prices in the bustling boutiques are
unsettling _ about 30 percent higher than in less touristed Naxos
and Tinos.
 &HT;    There are 365 churches on Mykonos, a church for every 10 people.
It is said that sailors swore to build a chapel to their patron
saints if the men survived the perilous storms at sea and were
delivered home safely. The churches stand as the survivors'
promises fulfilled.
 &HT;    The most spectacular stop, Shaver remembers, was Santorini, now
called Thira. The Zeus sailed close to the huge, black, forbidding
caldera of an exploded volcano. Sometime in the Bronze Age the
volcano erupted, wiping out the flourishing Minoan culture of Crete
and burying the ancient Thira under tons of debris.
 &HT;    The modern town of Thira is 900 feet straight up above the
little dock where tenders deposited visitors. A few intrepid
tourists tried to ascend in the old, traditional way _ by mule. But
most, upon taking a look at the bony, weak-looking mules, opted to
take the gleaming steel funicular that carries visitors painlessly
up the cliff.
 THE VOYAGE HOME  
 &HT;    On the last night, the Zeus glided back toward the mainland and
anchored at Kea, much like the ancient galleons had done _ and for
the same reason: The winds were gusting dangerously.
 &HT;    Shaver fondly recalls that final night on board the Zeus, as
voices grew loud and heavily sentimental: ``Akis stretched out and
and held forth about the hunger in the Greek soul, the terrible
angst that is part of the Greek heritage.
 &HT;    ``And our most verbal Elderhosteler responded by waxing eloquent
about the indelible impact of standing in Cycladic fields strewn
with columbine and anemones, pondering the stories the stones could
tell, feeling the breeze stirring the embers of past
civilizations.''
 &HT;    The study cruise described was packaged for Elderhostel by
International Study Tours Inc., one of many overseas learning

 &HT;    
 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    What could possibly be more romantic than an island cruise on
board a Greek caique?
 &HT;    Beverly Shaver of El Cerrito, Calif., and her 32 fellow
Elderhostelers visualized that the tiny vessel scheduled to take
them around the Aegean to explore the fabled Cyclades Islands would
be a combination of the Bounty (as in Mutiny) and a Sultan's
barque. Even the ship's name _ the Zeus III _ conjured idyllic
images.
 &HT;    ``Of course the reality, when we first glimpsed her bobbing at
the Pireaus mooring, resembled neither Bounty nor barque,'' Shaver
says. ``One-hundred-sixteen feet long, she was a chunky blend of
Manhattan Island ferry and tugboat-with-mast painted red and
white.''
 &HT;    From Piraeus, the port for Athens, the Zeus set a course due
east, sailing on a serene sea _ no seasick stomachs here. Forty
nautical miles and four hours out, it glided into snug St. Nicholas
Bay on the tranquil little island of Kea.
 AN UNTAINTED WORLD  
 &HT;    Modern Kea is a typical Cycladic village with small sugarcube
houses lining narrow, winding, stone-paved streets. Here one can
find the unspoiled little Grecian paradise always promised in
brochures, Shaver says, and which is so seldom delivered. Here, as
on almost all the Cyclades, are 2,000-year-old ruins and sparkling
beaches for snorkeling and swimming.
 &HT;    The passengers' first dinner aboard the Zeus consisted of
chicken broth thickened with rice and eggs, prawns with rice,
artichokes and broad beans in oil with dill and lemon. The feast
was topped off with honey-and-nut cake with custard filling.
 &HT;    These Elderhostelers were now pretend-patrons of the Zeus'
gourmet restaurant. A deckhand named Demos, who only hours earlier
was seen wearing greasy overalls and cursing a jammed winch, was
transformed into a dignified, cummerbunded waiter. Passengers and
crew would treat one another with the formal politeness due their
respective, changeable roles.
 &HT;    Captain Voul-garikis urged everyone to try Retsina, the famed
liqueur. But of course, they agreed, eager to have the whole
glorious Greek experience.
 &HT;    Retsina, Shaver found, was clearly an acquired taste.
``Retsina,'' said the group wag, ``tastes like pure turpentine
that's been strained through a fisherman's sock.''
 &HT;    A pattern was quickly established. Zeus passengers were hooked
on listening to lectures, reading Greek novels and exploring the
wonders of the island. Watching the sun set became a ritual, and
dogged efforts were made to master Greek dancing.
 THE SALON CLASSROOM  
 &HT;    In the mornings, the salon became a classroom where
anthropologist Akis Papataxiarchis held forth for several hours
each day before reaching the next port.
 &HT;    Staying almost always in sight of land, the Zeus scudded from
island to island _ places such as Tinos, Delos, Ios, Mykonos,
Naxos, Paros, Thira.
 &HT;    Sleeping in ports through the nights, Elderhostelers saw the
darkness studded with flickering lanterns as fishermen speared
octopus and squid off the rocks. They wakened each morning to the
cries of gulls, the clop of mules on quayside planks and the sound
of limp octopuses being slapped against wharf pilings by young
Greek boys working to tenderize the meat, Shaver says.
 &HT;    Delos, one of the smallest of the Cyclades, was the most famous
of all in ancient times. Legendary birthplace of Apollo, it
attracted hordes of pilgrims bearing gifts and became the treasury
for the Delian League.
 &HT;    Now Delos stands deserted and uninhabited, strewn with the
bleached bones of ruined temples, mansions, baths and splendid
mosaics _ all guarded by the celebrated lean and hungry stone
lionesses.
 &HT;    On picturesque Mykonos prices in the bustling boutiques are
unsettling _ about 30 percent higher than in less touristed Naxos
and Tinos.
 &HT;    There are 365 churches on Mykonos, a church for every 10 people.
It is said that sailors swore to build a chapel to their patron
saints if the men survived the perilous storms at sea and were
delivered home safely. The churches stand as the survivors'
promises fulfilled.
 &HT;    The most spectacular stop, Shaver remembers, was Santorini, now
called Thira. The Zeus sailed close to the huge, black, forbidding
caldera of an exploded volcano. Sometime in the Bronze Age the
volcano erupted, wiping out the flourishing Minoan culture of Crete
and burying the ancient Thira under tons of debris.
 &HT;    The modern town of Thira is 900 feet straight up above the
little dock where tenders deposited visitors. A few intrepid
tourists tried to ascend in the old, traditional way _ by mule. But
most, upon taking a look at the bony, weak-looking mules, opted to
take the gleaming steel funicular that carries visitors painlessly
up the cliff.
 THE VOYAGE HOME  
 &HT;    On the last night, the Zeus glided back toward the mainland and
anchored at Kea, much like the ancient galleons had done _ and for
the same reason: The winds were gusting dangerously.
 &HT;    Shaver fondly recalls that final night on board the Zeus, as
voices grew loud and heavily sentimental: ``Akis stretched out and
and held forth about the hunger in the Greek soul, the terrible
angst that is part of the Greek heritage.
 &HT;    ``And our most verbal Elderhosteler responded by waxing eloquent
about the indelible impact of standing in Cycladic fields strewn
with columbine and anemones, pondering the stories the stones could
tell, feeling the breeze stirring the embers of past
civilizations.''
 &HT;    The study cruise described was packaged for Elderhostel by
International Study Tours Inc., one of many overseas learning
programs offered year-round through Elderhostel. For more

   SEXY-HIGH-TECH (New York) _ A moire pattern of shimmering light
bounces off a grid of copper mesh _ not the usual sight one would
expect in the stair hall of a grand old Brooklyn townhouse. The
florid sworls of carved plaster moldings, maybe; the ample curve of
a stolid wooden banister, of course. But a two-story wall of metal
mesh layered on linen? And that's but one of many experimental
metal applications appearing throughout the pristine
late-19th-century house. What would Edith Wharton think? Or, coming
at it from our end of the century: Since when did High Tech get so
sexy? By Julie Iovine.
</P>
<P>
   DESIGN-DECORATION (Undated) _ Design is serious. Decoration is
superficial. In the 20th century, modern design and interior
decoration have never had much use for each other. Design was a
science _ a hard body of facts. It was technology, like engineering
and architecture. It had purpose. Interior decoration was fashion _
an art when it prayed hard. It knows how to stop a room when it
walks in. Since the 17th century, when it appeared professionally,
it was a rich man's game. But modern design and decorator taste
have been showing up together lately _ and they make a
great-looking team.
</P>
<P>
   FREY-ARCHITECTURE (Palm Springs, Calif.) _ Albert Frey hates
waste. He sees no need for water-hungry lawns or spacious homes. He
lives modestly in a 16-by-32-foot house made of low-maintenance
materials that he built for himself 34 years ago. His principle in
life and architecture, he explains, is to ``do the most with the
least.'' So why are the young and the affluent drawn to a
94-year-old man living in a space they'd normally consider too
small to swing a cat in? Because Albert Frey is the living
embodiment of a minimalist philosophy of life and design that is
enjoying a revival by a generation fattened on the go-go 1980s and
'90s. By Frances Anderton.

<P>
   LOTTERY-TICKETS (Undated) _ One night, while buying a quart of
milk at a convenience store deep in the Catskills, I found myself
standing in front of a glass display case holding perhaps 20 neat
stacks of instant lottery tickets. Maybe it was the mountain air,
or maybe it was the magnitude of the display, but suddenly I found
these butterfly-bright slips of cardboard exotic and intriguing. By
Karrie Jacobs.

   REPLICA-FURNISHINGS (Wilmington, N.C.) _ Electric cables,
television monitors, lighting and sound paraphernalia crowded the
front hallway of the two-story saltbox house. Gingerly stepping
over the wires, I crossed the foyer _ and the family home of my
imagination came alive. I spotted the dining room through an
archway: a faux-Tiffany lamp hung above an antique table of dark
luminous wood, surrounded by six red-velvet Louis XIII chairs. Made
to order in Paris by James Ivory and Ismail Merchant for their film
``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries,'' these were replicas of the
originals I grew up with. Real ones would have been too expensive
to buy and then ship all the way to the United States. By Kaylie
Jones.

<TEXT>

<P>
   Justin Kalesto doesn't want to wake up. A woman is calling his
name, but he turns his head deeper into his pillow. He is 12 years
old, and from Mangbangau, a village deep in remote southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Justin's sunken abdomen curves inward like a bowl. His nostrils
are clogged with bacteria and dried mucus and the skin around his
closed eyes puffs out, giving him the face of a frog.
</P>
<P>
   Justin has become home for hundreds of thousands of whip-shaped
parasites called trypanosomes. They have fed on his blood and made
their way into his brain. Generally the human victim of such an
invasion sinks into an irritable haze, slips into a coma and dies.
Hence the name of the disease: sleeping sickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know where you are?'' a woman asks in English, and a
Sudanese nurse translates. He nods and says, ``Tambura,'' the name
of the town where this hospital is located. The woman tries to bend
his head, but it's too stiff _ his entire back is rigid as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone comes in and you can't bend their head,'' the
woman says to the Sudanese men and women standing with her by the
cot, ``get a doctor immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Her name is Mickey Richer. She is a short 53-year-old woman with
a gray mop of hair, dressed in a T-shirt and pale-blue surgical
pants. She prescribes shots of steroids and says, ``OK, Justin, see
you later.'' He offers no response, not even a glance.
</P>
<P>
   There are 102 other patients at the Tambura County Hospital
being treated today for advanced sleeping sickness.
</P>
<P>
   Justin is one of an estimated 9,000 to 12,000 in Tambura County
who are sick with the disease _ 20 percent of the population. And
he is only one of perhaps hundreds of thousands who have become
infected recently in southern Sudan and its neighbors, the Central
African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly
Zaire).
</P>
<P>
   Once considered a disease fading into oblivion, sleeping
sickness is raging again, particularly here. In all of southern
Sudan, Richer is running the only program to fight the disease, and
she is able to save only a handful of lives.
</P>
<P>
   Richer was already in her 40s when she began working in places
like Tambura.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to do Third World work; that's why I went to
medical school,'' she says. ``I thought I'd be a pediatrician for
one or two years and then move on. I loved the kids so much I
stayed around for 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   She finally left her practice in Denver in 1987 to spend a year
in northern Sudan, working in a camp for refugees driven there by
recurrent famines.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward she went to the prestigious Liverpool School of
Tropical Medicine and then returned to Africa with the
International Medical Corps, a Los Angeles-based group of doctors
and nurses who bring medical care to places wrecked by war and
disaster, such as Angola, Bosnia and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   When Richer first came to Tambura in 1994, she didn't know she
was landing in the middle of an epidemic. Her job was to resurrect
the county hospital, abandoned during the ongoing civil war. But it
didn't take Richer long to notice the parasites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a few people with sleeping sickness in 1994,'' she
remembers, ``and in 1995 I treated 19 patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The single-celled trypanosomes that cause sleeping sickness
spend their time cycling between humans and tsetse flies. They
linger in the gut of the fly, absorbing amino acids and other
molecules that the fly gets by biting mammals. After about 10 days
the trypanosomes move into the fly's salivary glands.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for their new home, the parasites cloak themselves in
a coat made of millions of copies of a single sugary molecule.
</P>
<P>
   Our immune cells fashion antibodies that correspond to this
molecule's shape, and the antibodies enable the immune system to
kill the parasite in huge numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But some individual trypanosomes take evasive action. They shut
down the genes they use to build their coat and turn on a new set
in their place. They can then build a new surface molecule, one
similar enough to the old one to do the job but which no longer
matches the antibodies.
</P>
<P>
   Now invisible, the parasite thrives while the immune system
starts a new eradication campaign from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   But trypanosomes have hundreds of coat-coding genes that they
hold in reserve, and they can easily continue to slip away from the
body's attack. As they wear out the immune system, the parasites
feed on their host's blood.
</P>
<P>
   Months or years can pass before some of them cross the barrier
that protects the brain.
</P>
<P>
   When Richer came to Tambura, there hadn't been a major outbreak
of sleeping sickness since the late '70s, and at first she simply
dealt with cases as they came in. But the number steadily grew: The
19 patients she treated in 1995 became 87 the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Richer estimated that in Tambura County, 20 percent of
the people were infected. Back in 1988, she calculated, the rate
had been no more than .5 percent. Over the course of nine years it
had multiplied 40 times.
</P>
<P>
   If a person tests positive for sleeping sickness, there is only
one way to know if the trypanosomes have reached the brain, and
that is to perform a spinal tap.
</P>
<P>
   If the patient is lucky, and no parasites are found in the
cerebrospinal fluid, he or she will be treated with a drug called
pentamidine. After 10 daily injections, most of them are cured.
</P>
<P>
   People with parasites in their cerebrospinal fluid have a much
harder future ahead of them. Pentamidine is useless for these
people. In their advanced condition they need stronger stuff _ a
nasty potion known as melarsoprol.
</P>
<P>
   Melarsoprol is, essentially, a poison. It is almost 20 percent
arsenic. If the melarsoprol should seep out of the vein, it kills
the surrounding tissue, creating a swollen, painful mass of flesh.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least the therapy has to be stopped for a few days,
and at worst the arm may have to be amputated.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Carsello, a nurse from San Francisco, has been teaching the
nurses at the hospital how to administer melarsoprol and deal with
its side effects.
</P>
<P>
   The adult patients bow their heads and clench their teeth as the
drug hits their veins. The screaming children have to be pinned
down.
</P>
<P>
   Melarsoprol works its cure quickly. However, it can cause
trouble quickly too. In a small fraction of patients such as Justin
Kalesto, the brain suddenly swells. Other patients come out of
their comas in a psychotic state.
</P>
<P>
   Richer and Carsello remember some of the nicer psychotics
fondly: the girl who danced through the yard all day, the boy who
escaped from the hospital, went to a compound where care workers
lived, took 21 empty yellow plastic jerricans and stacked them
meticulously next to his bed.
</P>
<P>
   ----
</P>
<P>
   The next day Justin is still alive. In fact, the swelling of his
head and neck has gone down, his nose is clean, and when Richer
comes to examine him he is propped on his elbows, slowly drinking
broth out of a bowl. He still doesn't want to smile or talk, but
Richer is glad to see he's better. It means he'll probably be
cured.
</P>
<P>
   Richer's original plan was to stop the epidemic by wiping out
the disease throughout Tambura County. It called for screening
every village, testing everybody in the ones hardest hit,
identifying the patients' stage of the disease, treating them and
following them up for two years to make sure they didn't relapse.
</P>
<P>
   The price tag came to $2.4 million for the first year.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance at the U.S.
Administration for International Development agreed to come up with
money, but only $1 million _ enough to screen and treat 20,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government said, `I'm sorry, it's a million. You can find
and treat as many people as you can with a million, but that's it,
you're not getting any more,''' Richer says. ``I cried and fought
and yelled and screamed and kicked. I said to them, `God, how can I
pick which 20,000?'''
</P>
<P>
   According to Valerie Newson Guarnieri, senior regional team
leader for USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, stopping
the outbreak was beyond their focus on primary health care in
southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal was to address the major causes of morbidity and
mortality, things like malaria, diarrhea, respiratory infections.
Sleeping sickness was not part of that strategy,'' she says. ``We
were willing to contribute to get the disease back down to endemic
levels, but we just don't have the resources to eradicate the
disease. We hoped our initial input would help bring other donors
to the table.'' It didn't.
</P>
<P>
   As of April, Richer's staff had screened more than 10,000
people, and they'd treated more than 1,500 of them. Only four
people out of 700 in the first stage of sleeping sickness died, and
20 out of 800 stage 2 patients. About 10 percent of stage 1
patients have relapsed, and 25 percent to 35 percent of stage 2
patients. Some of them can be treated with alternative drugs, but
others can't be helped.
</P>
<P>
   Richer has in fact managed to keep this corner of Tambura County
healthy, but she doesn't feel much sense of victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not deluding myself that by treating 1,500 patients we've
done anything with the epidemic. Probably not. There are probably
12,000 infected people out there, and still a lot of people left
for those tsetse flies to bite. But you've got to start
somewhere.''

   ``I saved the most interesting case for last,'' said Molly
Wilson, the resident who'd been on call the night before.
</P>
<P>
   As the attending physician that month, the most senior doctor on
the service, it was my job to make sure the children in the
Infants' Unit got the best care possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This baby's name is Jarret Fox,'' Molly continued. ``He's a
3-month-old who was admitted last night for dehydration. His mom
says Jarret was happy and healthy a week ago. Then, on Tuesday, he
seemed to lose interest in nursing. He just stopped sucking, his
mother says, and he hasn't eaten anything since.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That can't be right,'' I responded. ``Three-month-olds don't
just suddenly stop nursing and starve themselves until they get
dehydrated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I didn't believe it either at first, but the mother
keeps telling the same story: She's been trying to force-feed him
since Wednesday but hasn't had any success. Yesterday she brought
him to her pediatrician. He said Jarret was about 5 percent
dehydrated. He also said the kid was much floppier than he'd been
the last time he'd seen him. So he sent him in for rehydration and
a full evaluation.''
</P>
<P>
   The part about the increased floppiness made my heart sink. It
suggested a condition I hoped this baby didn't have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have any ideas about a diagnosis?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I can think of is spinal muscular atrophy,''
Molly said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'm thinking, too,'' I replied. ``I hope we're
wrong. Let's go see him.''
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, a diagnosis of the infantile form of SMA is a death
sentence. A relatively rare inherited disease in which the nerves
that control movement mysteriously degenerate and disappear, it is
the childhood equivalent of the better-known (but no better
understood) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   As the nerves vanish during the first months of life, a child
with SMA grows progressively weaker. After initial problems with
feeding, the infant loses the ability to move its arms and legs.
Breathing also becomes difficult.
</P>
<P>
   With time, the child becomes more and more hungry for air until
finally, by about the first birthday, he or she dies. The cause is
usually pneumonia, a common infection in lungs that aren't getting
enough air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Fox,'' Molly said as we approached Jarret's crib, ``this
is Dr. Marion. He's our attending pediatrician.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry we have to meet under these circumstances,'' I said.
Barefoot, clad in a peasant blouse and bell-bottom jeans, her long,
straight hair parted down the middle, Jarret's mom looked like a
long-lost refugee from the Summer of Love.
</P>
<P>
   At my request, Ms. Fox spilled out the short tale of her son's
life. After an uncomplicated pregnancy, Jarret had been born at his
parents' home. He was the couple's second child: their daughter,
Jessica, now 3 years old, was ``healthy as a horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his birth was attended only by a midwife, Jarret was
examined on the first day of life by the family's pediatrician (the
only one in the area who practiced homeopathic medicine and made
house calls) and declared to be in excellent health. His mother
could think of nothing unusual about her son's newborn period.
</P>
<P>
   The infant had been seen by the pediatrician on a regular
schedule. He'd received his immunizations and had been growing and
developing normally.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fox explained that her family were strict vegetarians who
ate only whole, natural foods. She assured me that Jarret had had
nothing but breast milk.
</P>
<P>
   But four days ago this idyllic existence had ended. Jarret had
simply refused to nurse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just wouldn't latch onto my breast,'' she said sadly.
``Nothing I did got him interested. It was like a switch had been
turned off in his brain and he wouldn't do it anymore. Just like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Has he been hungry?'' I asked, less certain now about the
diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first he was,'' she said. ``That first day, he cried and
cried. It was pathetic. But since then, he's just been lifeless,
like he just doesn't care anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me again, when did you first notice this change in
Jarret?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuesday afternoon,'' Ms. Fox replied. ``When he woke up from
his nap. He's usually starving when he wakes up. But that day, I
couldn't get him to take my breast for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   I nodded. ``And your 3-year-old. Tell me, how does she get along
with Jarret? Does she help you take care of him?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, she's crazy about him,'' Ms. Fox replied with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Jarret's exclusively breast-fed, she hasn't ever fed
him, has she?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we'd never let her. But she always pretends to feed him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But as far as you know, she's never actually fed him?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely not,'' Ms. Fox replied. ``My husband and I are
always at the table supervising. We'd never let Jess put anything
in the baby's mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   I nodded and continued: ``Ms. Fox, what does Jessica have for
breakfast?''
</P>
<P>
   The mother, somewhat surprised by the non sequitur, answered
without hesitation: ``A bowl of hot oatmeal and a glass of milk.
Why do you ask?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Does Jessica eat the oatmeal plain, or does she put sugar on
it?'' I asked, already knowing what the answer would be.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Ms. Fox gave me an angry look. ``Dr. Marion, we eat
only whole, natural foods _ no meat, no processed food, no sugar.
Sugar is poison.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, no sugar,'' I pushed on. ``But does Jessica use anything
to sweeten her oatmeal?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We allow her to use a teaspoon or two of honey,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Fox, we have to do some tests, but I think Jarret's going
to be OK. I'm pretty sure he's got botulism.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Early that Tuesday morning, the Foxes were all in the kitchen.
Jarret had been placed at the table next to his sister, who was
enjoying a bowl of oatmeal that had been topped with a few dollops
of natural honey, straight from the hive.
</P>
<P>
   The children's parents had perhaps stepped away from the table
to prepare their own breakfasts. Suddenly, Jessica, pretending to
be Jarret's mother, silently offered her brother a spoonful of
cereal.
</P>
<P>
   The infant eagerly accepted the offer, and Jessica, still in
silence, finished off the bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Jarret took his usual afternoon nap. When he
awoke, his mother found that he could no longer take her breast.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Fox continued to answer my questions, I became more
convinced that this scenario (or one like it) had occurred. It had
to have: After hearing the story and seeing Jarret, there was no
other logical explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans believe that when applied to foods, terms like
``pure'' and ``natural'' are synonymous with ``healthy'' and
``nutritious.'' This may be accurate for most foods, but not honey.
</P>
<P>
   Eating honey _ in both natural and processed form _ can lead to
serious disease or even death in infants. Because of the
environment in which it's produced, unprocessed honey often
contains spores of Clostridium botulinum, the bacterium that causes
botulism. The same can be true for processed honey.
</P>
<P>
   In most humans, the spores cause no problems: Immune cells in
the intestinal tracts of older children and adults release proteins
that readily bind to and destroy the toxin. But in children under 1
year of age, infants whose intestinal tracts are still immature,
the C. botulinum survives and starts making toxins. And that spells
big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   If the child is supported through this period _ if he is
tube-fed, provided with oxygen, and placed on a ventilator if
breathing becomes difficult _ he will eventually return to the
state he was in prior to the disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Lab results confirmed the presence of C. botulinum toxin not
only in Jarret's serum and feces but in a specimen taken from the
jar of honey from the Foxes' pantry as well.
</P>
<P>
   As for Jarret, it took him more than five weeks to return to his
prepoisoned state, and his recovery was not without complication.
</P>
<P>
   On the afternoon of his admission to the hospital, his breathing
had become labored, and when a blood-gas analysis revealed signs of
respiratory failure, he was transferred to the icu, where he was
intubated and placed on a ventilator.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks he remained dependent on machines, unable to breathe,
suck or swallow, cry or smile, or move any of his muscles. He
continued to be fed milk pumped from his mother's breast (she
wouldn't allow him to be fed anything else) through the feeding
tube.
</P>
<P>
   Then in early March, his nurse noted what appeared to be a
flicker of movement in his left leg. It was so subtle at first that
she thought she'd only imagined it, but more movement occurred in
the following hours. Slowly but surely, Jarret was regaining
control of his nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few days, he was gradually weaned off the
ventilator. Soon the feeding tube was removed, and he began eating
on his own again, first from a syringe, then from a bottle, and
finally, more than a month after he had entered the hospital,
directly from his mother's breast. Just about back to his old self,
he was discharged in the middle of March.

   HIGHLAND PARK, N.J. _ If there's an inexorable inertia in
political events, it's valid to say that President Clinton will
resign the presidency in six months to a year. Public opinion,
which up until a few weeks ago had been so favorable to him, is
moving slowly in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to what could be expected, a majority of the citizens
have been curious and indifferent; they haven't condemned the
scandal. Instead, the fallen idol has been censured above all by
those who were his most loyal allies: the liberal press and the
Democratic Party's top brass.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's image and leadership capacity have been eroded more by
the fierce editorials of The New York Times _ which less than two
years ago came out for his reelection _ and by the moral warnings
of Sen. Kenneth Liberman, Clinton's friend of three decades, than
by the bloodhound's harassment of independent counsel Kenneth
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Liberman's Sept. 3 address to the Senate deepened the general
feeling of shame among politicians. The fact that a U.S. president
is ``the distillation of the common people in one man'' _ but that
his sexual incontinence is the object of cruel jokes even in the
brothels of Quito and Karachi _ is more than can be tolerated by
the proud fathers and mothers who protect the ``American way of
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of simmering down each time Clinton admits his relations
with Monica Lewinsky were inappropriate, the holy indignation of
the national leaders boils hotter each time. First, the president
wouldn't admit to an adultery that was clear to all; then he lied
under oath and tried to hide behind sophisms about sex; then he
wouldn't show remorse. Now, of course, we have the Starr report
with its lurid narrative.
</P>
<P>
   Finally cornered, Clinton assumes the image of a man who is
remorseful _ but only when his time has run out. It is almost the
same, with a shade of difference, as the hypocrisy that preceded
the fall of Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   In Latin America, this American tragedy is met only by ironies
and puzzlement. Used to innumerable adulterous, womanizing
presidents _ some of whom have had an official wife for protocol
functions and an illegitimate one for domestic happiness _ Latin
Americans can't understand why a private affair is causing so many
public storms.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody forgets, of course, that falseness and perjury,
intolerable in any culture, are especially so in the American
culture. I spoke about it with a prominent businessman in Sao
Paulo, Brazil, and the former president of a South American country
_ both of them respectable husbands and family men who would never
have a clandestine love affair.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's position is so exalted and he's been told so many
times each day that he is ``the world's most powerful man,'' he
can't avoid a certain feeling of omnipotence, the ex-head of state
told me.
</P>
<P>
   ``If John F. Kennedy was almost a sex addict who had affairs in
the White House, and FDR had a secret love for 20 years, what's to
stop Clinton from thinking his historical image won't be as pure as
those predecessors'?'' the businessman asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what should stop him?'' the ex-national leader
replied. ``The fact that this information is in everybody's hands
today. Four or six decades ago, governments could stop intimate
stories from being filtered to the media. Nothing can be hidden
these days. The press has been more tolerant of Clinton than is
commonly thought. It ignored the case of Gennifer Flowers, the
model; paid no credence to the accusations of Paula Jones. But
Monica Lewinsky's affair went beyond everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even so, you have to put yourself in the president's place:
Where is the adulterous husband who voluntarily confesses his love
adventures? And what man, when cornered, doesn't feel like telling
his lover to keep quiet?''
</P>
<P>
   In Latin America, Clinton's sexual adventures are much less
scandalous than those of _ to cite one example _ the Venezuelan
dictator Juan Vicente Gomez, who passed away unmarried in December
1935, it is said, without ever having spent a whole night with one
woman. This wasn't an obstacle to his having two homes at the same
time and begetting seven sons with one woman and eight with
another.
</P>
<P>
   The Argentinean Juan Peron also had such leanings. In 1954, a
year and a half after he was widowed for the second time, Peron _
who was then 59 and attracted to junior high school girls _
developed a strong interest in a 14-year-old, Nelly Rivas. She
lived with him, playing with her dolls and listening to radio soap
operas, until the president was deposed in September 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years later, when I asked Peron in Madrid about that
episode, he answered with a phrase which afterward would become
commonplace among the strongmen of Latin America: ``Yes, I was
accused then of liking women too much. I don't see what's wrong
with that. It would be bad if I liked men.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Carlos Menem, the Argentinean president, repeated
that phrase, almost to the word.
</P>
<P>
   Fidel Castro, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, Carlos Andres Perez,
the Brazilian Fernando Collor de Melo _ who used to turn off the
lights in his office when he was with one of his lady friends, to
warn his secretaries he did not want to be bothered _ they all had
erotic affairs that did not erode their popular ratings one bit
and, in fact, probably increased them.
</P>
<P>
   None of the womanizing leaders of Latin America owed political
decline to sexual incontinence. There were other reasons:
corruption, military putsches, ineffective policies. For them,
bedroom stories, as Clinton would like to say, were not an affair
of state.
</P>
<P>
   Yet within current American culture, if the charges against
Clinton continue rolling down the same slanted plane, it's hard to
imagine how he will he able to avoid stepping down. Now, shortly
before the crucial elections for Congress, the democratic
candidates have turned their back on him in an open stampede. They
think the immense ridicule that has centered on the president, and
which has immeasurably affected the country, will spread by
contagion to the party.
</P>
<P>
   Every future news story and speech makes it worse. ``For he who
has committed a mistake, nothing is as terrible as hearing about it
again,'' said Pericles, in Shakespeare's play of the same name.
</P>
<P>

Novel'' and ``Santa Evita.'' He is chairman of the Latin American

   SCI-SUPPLEMENT-RISK (Undated) _ People trying to treat their own
ailments with remedies from the health-food store have become
severely ill from pills and powders sold as ``dietary
supplements,'' according to six separate reports being published
today in the New England Journal of Medicine. The reports, the
journal says in an editorial, point to the dangers of the Dietary
Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, which freed herbal
remedies and vitamins from FDA oversight. Lead poisoning,
impotence, blood clots, nausea and abnormal heart rhythms were
among the disorders described, resulting from powerful herbs, toxic
contaminants or the presence of potent drugs or hormones in
products that were supposed to be ``all natural'' and free of
drugs. In addition, several children with cancer suffered
progression of tumors when treated with alternative remedies. By
Denise Grady. (1400 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MYSTERY-FORCE (Undated) _ A team of space scientists and
physicists has confessed to being baffled by a very faint force of
attraction that seems to be pushing four spacecraft towar the sun.
Although the effect has been known for 19 years, the group's
exhaustive investigation of possible causes has turned up no
explanation, and the scientists say they cannot rule out the
possibility that some hitherto unknown physical phenomenon may be
involved. The conclusions and surmises of Dr. John D. Anderson of
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and his colleagues at Los Alamos
National Laboratory will be published in a report in the journal
Physical Review Letters. By Malcolm Browne.

whether to recommend approval of Emberol, an Immunex product which

   OVARIAN-CANCER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Cindy Melancom says she felt tired and stressed out
and suffered vague, nonspecific symptoms for months: backache, lack
of appetite, bloating, lack of energy. She attributed it to age and
depression over the death of her father. Then she found the lump in
her abdomen that led to a diagnosis of advanced ovarian cancer.
That was 6 1/2 years ago. She was 41. By CAROLYN POIROT. Story will
move in ``l'' lifestyle category. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ANDERSON-COLUMN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Maternal instinct. Wherever does it come from? You
certainly can't drink it from a long-neck bottle. You can't rub it
into your skin like a facial cream. You can't inhale it or swallow
it in capsule form. Despite all of our modern scientific advances,
we've yet to come up with a formula that can make a mother love her
children. Sadly, we need one. By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON. Story

   WILLIE NELSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Texas Lil's Diamond A Ranch near Justin in North Texas

Springs, N.Y.; Hyannis, Mass.; and Biloxi, Miss. _ which the Texas
crooner prefers for promoting ``Teatro,'' his compact disc released

JANET TYSON. Story will move in ``e'' entertainment category. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LIVE-MUSIC &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Barring an unforeseen accident, by the time you read
this, Shania Twain will have played Dallas' Reunion Arena, having
blown through town on her first national tour _ which comes only
after she has sold more than 10 million CDs. Let's roll that one
around on the tongue again: Her first solo tour _ AFTER she has
sold more than 10 million CDs. Twain, Mariah Carey, the Spice Girls
and others long ago realized and capitalized on something
unthinkable even 15 years ago: Live performances are not essential
to selling boatloads of CDs. By DAVE FERMAN. Story will move in
``e'' entertainment category. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TURANDOH?-TURANDOT?-TURANWHAT? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ It's tough to sound as if you know what you're talking
about when the opera is ``Turandot.'' Because whichever way you
pronounce the title, somebody's going to think you're putting on
airs. Or that you'r undereducated and colloquial. Or took too many
French classes in high school. Or haven't kept up with your
reading. TuranDOT, with a ``T'' at the end? Or TuranDOH, with
silent final ``T''? By WAYNE LEE GAY. Story will move in ``e''

   &UR; SCIENCE &LR;  (``a'' code)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SUPPLEMENT-RISK (Undated) _ People trying to treat their own
ailments with remedies from the health-food store have become
severely ill from pills and powders sold as ``dietary
supplements,'' according to six separate reports being published
today in the New England Journal of Medicine. The reports, the
journal says in an editorial, point to the dangers of the Dietary
Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, which freed herbal
remedies and vitamins from FDA oversight. Lead poisoning,
impotence, blood clots, nausea and abnormal heart rhythms were
among the disorders described, resulting from powerful herbs, toxic
contaminants or the presence of potent drugs or hormones in
products that were supposed to be ``all natural'' and free of
drugs. In addition, several children with cancer suffered
progression of tumors when treated with alternative remedies. By
Denise Grady. (1400 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MYSTERY-FORCE (Undated) _ A team of space scientists and
physicists has confessed to being baffled by a very faint force of
attraction that seems to be pushing four spacecraft toward the sun.
Although the effect has been known for 19 years, the group's
exhaustive investigation of possible causes has turned up no
explanation, and the scientists say they cannot rule out the
possibility that some hitherto unknown physical phenomenon may be
involved. The conclusions and surmises of Dr. John D. Anderson of
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and his colleagues at Los Alamos
National Laboratory will be published in a report in the journal
Physical Review Letters. By Malcolm Browne.

<P>
   SEXY-HIGH-TECH (New York) _ A moire pattern of shimmering light
bounces off a grid of copper mesh _ not the usual sight one would
expect in the stair hall of a grand old Brooklyn townhouse. The
florid sworls of carved plaster moldings, maybe; the ample curve of
a stolid wooden banister, of course. But a two-story wall of metal
mesh layered on linen? And that's but one of many experimental
metal applications appearing throughout the pristine
late-19th-century house. What would Edith Wharton think? Or, coming
at it from our end of the century: Since when did High Tech get so
sexy? By Julie Iovine.
</P>
<P>
   DESIGN-DECORATION (Undated) _ Design is serious. Decoration is
superficial. In the 20th century, modern design and interior
decoration have never had much use for each other. Design was a
science _ a hard body of facts. It was technology, like engineering
and architecture. It had purpose. Interior decoration was fashion _
an art when it prayed hard. It knows how to stop a room when it
walks in. Since the 17th century, when it appeared professionally,
it was a rich man's game. But modern design and decorator taste
have been showing up together lately _ and they make a
great-looking team.
</P>
<P>
   FREY-ARCHITECTURE (Palm Springs, Calif.) _ Albert Frey hates
waste. He sees no need for water-hungry lawns or spacious homes. He
lives modestly in a 16-by-32-foot house made of low-maintenance
materials that he built for himself 34 years ago. His principle in
life and architecture, he explains, is to ``do the most with the
least.'' So why are the young and the affluent drawn to a
94-year-old man living in a space they'd normally consider too
small to swing a cat in? Because Albert Frey is the living
embodiment of a minimalist philosophy of life and design that is
enjoying a revival by a generation fattened on the go-go 1980s and
'90s. By Frances Anderton.
</P>
<P>
   LOTTERY-TICKETS (Undated) _ One night, while buying a quart of
milk at a convenience store deep in the Catskills, I found myself
standing in front of a glass display case holding perhaps 20 neat
stacks of instant lottery tickets. Maybe it was the mountain air,
or maybe it was the magnitude of the display, but suddenly I found
these butterfly-bright slips of cardboard exotic and intriguing. By
Karrie Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Garden questions answered. By Leslie
Land.
</P>
<P>
   REPLICA-FURNISHINGS (Wilmington, N.C.) _ Electric cables,
television monitors, lighting and sound paraphernalia crowded the
front hallway of the two-story saltbox house. Gingerly stepping
over the wires, I crossed the foyer _ and the family home of my
imagination came alive. I spotted the dining room through an
archway: a faux-Tiffany lamp hung above an antique table of dark
luminous wood, surrounded by six red-velvet Louis XIII chairs. Made
to order in Paris by James Ivory and Ismail Merchant for their film
``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries,'' these were replicas of the
originals I grew up with. Real ones would have been too expensive
to buy and then ship all the way to the United States. By Kaylie
Jones.

   ``Which is your favorite island?'' I asked her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamaica,'' she replied without hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   I expressed mild surprise at her answer. ``Don't you find some
people there a tad aggressive toward tourists?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, they don't bother me,'' she said. ``I only go to the
all-inclusive resorts and never leave until it's time to fly
home.''
</P>
<P>
   How sad. Nothing against Sandals or Breezes or Couples or
Hedonism II. (Dare I admit that many, many years ago I spent a week
at Hedonism I?) These and other properties offer self-contained
products enjoyed by many Houstonians. But if the sole purpose of
our travels is to be chained figuratively to one resort, with no
desire to explore beyond, why go all the way to Jamaica?
</P>
<P>
   And yet that's the way an increasing number of travelers look at
a country whose beauty and charm, so ripe for exploration, are too
often hidden beneath the misguided actions of a few unruly
residents.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
AGGRESSIVE VENDORS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey by the Jamaican Tourist Board, 56 percent
of visitors to the island last year said they were harassed during
their stays. Of that number, 60 percent said they had been asked to
buy drugs. Others complained about overtures from prostitutes.
Thirteen percent said the incidents spoiled their trip.
</P>
<P>
   Last time I paused for a few hours at Montego Bay, we were
besieged by dozens of hawkers grabbing our arms, pushing and all
but demanding that we invest our money in trinkets, hair-braiding
or marijuana. And this was within 100 feet of a cruise ship.
</P>
<P>
   Because many other passengers complained about similar
treatment, only one ship is making weekly calls in Montego Bay
during this summer off-season, down from three last year. Overall
tourism isn't approaching the growth rate of most other Caribbean
islands.
</P>
<P>
   The Jamaican government, keenly aware of the economic impact
created by almost 2 million annual visitors, announced new, stiffer
penalties earlier this year for residents who bother tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Now, according to Cox News Service reporter Shelly Emling, the
island's Chamber of Commerce is proposing a more controversial
solution: legalized brothels and designated red-light districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we'd get the prostitutes off the streets,'' Emling
quotes Chamber president Howard Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
LASTING FIRST IMPRESSION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Based on my forays into the Caribbean the past few years, I fear
Jamaica may not be the only island that needs to take a long look
at itself. And I say that with great regret, because I have long
been enthralled by the region's beaches, its natural wonders, its
shopping and cuisine, and especially its people.
</P>
<P>
   I looked forward for some time to visiting St. Lucia, an island
highly recommended by friends. And I suspect that if I spent a week
there, I would be impressed. But with scant hours to spare on a
rainy afternoon this summer in Castries, St. Lucia's main cruise
port, I could barely take a step without being accosted. If I
didn't slip my hand into my pocket to procure a coin or two, I was
verbally harassed about my skinflint nature, my ancestry or _ yes,
the truth can hurt _ my weight.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the kind of first impression proud tourism officials
would prefer. And a port city often provides the initial impression
for visitors to any island.
</P>
<P>
   I've had similar experiences recently on St. Thomas in the U.S.
Virgin Islands and in Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Let me stress these points:
</P>
<P>
   One: Most Caribbean islands don't tolerate rude heckling and
physical harassment. On Aruba, Anguilla and in the Cayman Islands,
I've found residents almost unfailingly polite. The reality,
though, is that many travelers categorize widely diverse islands _
despite their different languages, heritages and cultures _ into
one huge entity: the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Two: I am not by nature an intolerant person. Nor am I easily
bothered. I understand and appreciate that people on these islands
_ and in much of our world _ are much less fortunate than I am. I
understand the motivation for their actions. I understand that the
money tourists spend for hair-braiding and trinkets and, sadly, for
drugs and sex helps islanders feed their children and put clothes
on their back.
</P>
<P>
   I'm aware, too, that many travel agents and tour companies and
Caribbean tourism representatives likely will object to my
addressing this subject _ theorizing that my words could cost them
money through lost business.
</P>
<P>
   But my strong feeling is that the islands of the Caribbean are
so beautiful, so special, that those encouraged to clean up their
act will attract more visitors. Bring more money to the tourist
industry. And ultimately feed and clothe more children. Instead of
establishing red-light districts, the real solution _ as in most
walks of life _ is education.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, as reporter Emling quotes Jamaican prime minister
P.J. Patterson: Persistent heckling threatens to ``kill the goose
that lays the golden egg.''

 By MICHAEL MASSING  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 NOTE: Full-length article (3,000 words) available on request  
 &HT;    Don't let Rudolph Giuliani fool you: Methadone works. Since its
introduction in the mid-1960s, studies have consistently shown that
the synthetic narcotic cuts addicts' craving for heroin, enabling
onetime street junkies to restart their lives. In so doing,
methadone helps boost employment, inhibit the spread of HIV and cut
crime.
 &HT;    That's why the New York City mayor's recent attacks _ he
denounced methadone as a chemical that's used to enslave people and
promised to abolish it from the city over the next few years _ have
left experts scratching their heads.
 &HT;    The mayor appears driven by a moral conviction that complete
abstinence from drugs is the only acceptable course. Yet if
Giuliani were truly interested in promoting abstinence from drugs,
he would have not simply condemned methadone but also announced a
major expansion of treatment programs whose express goal is to wean
addicts from the substance. (The city has virtually no such
programs now.)
 &HT;    He would also have announced the creation of more residential
programs that seek to change addicts' behavior. The mayor's failure
to do any of this raises the suspicion that it is not just
methadone he dislikes _ but drug treatment in general.
 &HT;    In this respect, Giuliani reflects a national mood. For nearly
20 years, the United States has waged a relentless war on drugs,
with treatment discounted as a weak weapon. Instead, the government
has sent spy planes swooshing over the Caribbean, built a
paramilitary base in Peru, mounted coca-eradication programs in
Bolivia _ and invaded Panama.
 &HT;    On the home front, narcotics agents have infiltrated hundreds of
drug gangs and busted countless drug dealers. In 1996, more than
1.5 million people were arrested for drug offenses. The nation's
prisons, which in 1980 housed fewer than 30,000 drug offenders,
today harbor nearly 300,000.
 &HT;    But this punitive approach has failed. Cocaine is cheaper than
ever, and heroin is selling at purity levels three times greater
than those of the mid-1980s. And drug abuse remains rampant. In
1996, the number of cocaine-related visits to hospital emergency
rooms topped 144,000, an all-time high. This despite an increase in
the federal antidrug budget from $1 billion in 1981 to $16 billion
in 1998.
 &HT;    Looking at numbers like these, it may seem as if the nation's
drug problem is all but intractable. But it isn't. Our penchant for
punishment has blinded us to the most effective strategy for
combating drug use: offering comprehensive treatment to every
addict who requests it.
 &HT;    Unfortunately, the case for expanding our commitment to
treatment programs frequently gets drowned out by more extreme
voices. Law-and-order types such as Giuliani call for ever more
police dragnets and undercover investigations.
 &HT;    On the opposing side, reformers push for drastic measures such
as drug legalization. Legalize drugs, they say, and the vast
criminal networks that traffic in them will disappear _ much like
the repeal of Prohibition led to the demise of speak-easies and
bathtub gin.
 &HT;    The end of Prohibition, however, also led to a sharp rise in
alcohol use. Between 1934 and 1944, per capita consumption in the
United States rose from 0.97 gallons to 2.07 gallons. (Today it is
2.25 gallons.) If illicit drugs were suddenly legalized, might not
consumption similarly rise?
 &HT;    By now, the risks of legalization have become so evident that
many onetime advocates have flocked to a new standard: harm
reduction. Drugs, it is argued, are here to stay, and society needs
to learn how to live with them. Our goal should be to reduce the
harm that drugs cause. To that end, they advocate a variety of
reforms, such as expanding needle-exchange programs and creating
safe injection rooms as alternatives to shooting galleries.
 &HT;    Some of these ideas clearly make sense. Needle-exchange
programs, for one, have been shown to reduce the transmission of
HIV. Yet harm reduction has serious limitations. For the most part,
it does not seek to get people off drugs but merely to help them
use drugs more safely. To express disapproval of addiction would,
in the harm reductionists' view, reinforce society's intolerance of
drug addicts.
 &HT;    While promoting tolerance is admirable, the harm reductionists
take it too far: If you should not stigmatize addicts, neither
should you condone addiction. And with its learn-to-live-with-drugs
approach, harm reduction offers no guidance on how to bring down
the appallingly high levels of drug addiction in this country.
 &HT;    Harm reduction does, at least, acknowledge one key fact: Helping
chronic users should be the target of drug policy. Washington
doesn't understand this. From recent actions in the nation's
capital _ such as Congress' decision to earmark $1 billion for
antidrug advertising aimed at teen-agers _ you might logically
conclude that the threat drugs pose to the nation consists mainly
of adolescent use.
 &HT;    In fact, teen-age drug use, while up some in recent years,
remains well below the peak levels of the late 1970s. What's more,
most of that increase consists of marijuana use. And while pot is
not harmless, and young people should be discouraged from using it,
it is not the problem heroin and cocaine are.
 &HT;    In contrast to teen-age pot smokers, adults who regularly use
heroin, cocaine and crack do pose problems: They commit muggings,
abuse children, suffer overdoses and spread disease. In all, there
are an estimated 3.6 million hard-core users in the United States.
While these addicts constitute only 20 percent of all drug users in
the country (most of the rest being casual, occasional users), they
consume about three-fourths of all the cocaine and heroin used
here.
 &HT;    Who are these problem users? Contrary to the many media accounts
of strung-out stockbrokers and models, addicts tend to be found not
in posh condominiums or suburban split-levels but in the housing
projects of urban America. Heavy users are disproportionately poor,
unemployed and members of minority groups. No headway can be made
in alleviating the nation's drug problem without finding a way to
get such users off drugs.
 &HT;    A good place to begin is suggested by a 1994 RAND study. The
researchers C. Peter Rydell and Susan Everingham set out to compare
the effectiveness of four types of drug-control programs:
source-country efforts (attacking drug production abroad),
interdiction (seizing drugs in transit to the United States),
domestic law enforcement (arresting and incarcerating sellers and
buyers) and drug treatment.
 &HT;    How much additional money, they asked, would the government have
to spend on each approach to reduce national cocaine consumption by
1 percent? Rydell and Everingham developed a model of the national
cocaine market, then fed into it more than 70 variables, from
seizure data to survey responses.
 &HT;    They were amazed at the results. Relying solely on domestic law
enforcement, the government would have to spend an additional $246
million to reduce U.S. cocaine consumption by 1 percent. Relying on
interdiction, it would have to spend $366 million, and on
source-country programs, a whopping $783 million. Relying solely on
drug treatment, however, the government would have to spend just
$34 million more.
 &HT;    In other words, treatment was 7 times more cost effective than
domestic law enforcement, 10 times more effective than interdiction
and 23 times more effective than attacking drugs at their source.
 &HT;    Such results contradict the conventional wisdom that treatment
does not work. Many Americans know of someone who entered a program
and did well while in it, only to relapse afterward. Nevertheless,
failed treatments do not cost very much and so do not dilute the
cost-effectiveness of treatment overall. More important, study
after study has demonstrated the efficacy of treatment.
 &HT;    In one recent analysis, the government tracked the performance
of 4,400 clients who entered treatment between July 1993 and
October 1995. Those clients were interviewed at the time they began
treatment, at the time they finished and a year later; the accuracy
of their responses was checked by random drug tests.
 &HT;    Seeking to study the most severe cases, the researchers
concentrated on programs serving people in public housing, on
welfare and in the criminal-justice system. The number of clients
saying they used crack dropped from 39.5 percent prior to treatment
to 17.8 percent a year later; for heroin, the number went from 23.6
percent to 12.6 percent. All told, drug consumption decreased by
roughly 50 percent.
 &HT;    Well, skeptics will say, treatment might be effective for
addicts who receive it, but how many really want it? Junkies, it's
commonly believed, simply do not want help. And to an extent,
that's true. Drugs not only impart intense pleasure but also
provide great comfort to people coping with various crises in their
lives.
 &HT;    Yet for many, the point eventually comes when the drugs
themselves begin to cause problems, from physical ailments to
family quarrels to legal troubles. And when that happens, addicts
are often open to help. That openness, however, is usually quite
fleeting, and unless it is exploited immediately, most will end up
back on the streets.
 &HT;    The current drug czar, Barry R. McCaffrey, is a retired
four-star general who before taking office had no experience with
drug treatment, and while he has frequently acknowledged the
importance of treatment, he has made this a low priority. And so
the treatment gap persists.
 &HT;    That a focus on treatment can work is apparent from the one time
it was actually tried _ during the Nixon administration. A staunch
advocate of law and order, Nixon deferred to no one in his strident
pronouncements on drugs, but during the 1968 campaign he promised
to bring down the nation's crime rate, and once in office, he faced
the need to deliver.
 &HT;    At the time, the nation was in the throes of a raging heroin
epidemic. If something could be done to sap it, Nixon's advisers
believed, the crime wave might abate. One obvious approach was to
try to reduce the flow of heroin into the country.
 &HT;    At the time, the main conduit was the French Connection, a
5,000-mile pipeline originating in Turkish poppy fields and passing
through France. The Nixon administration began pressing the French
and Turkish governments to crack down on local drug trafficking.
 &HT;    But the more Nixon's drug officials looked into the problem, the
more they became convinced that reducing the supply of drugs would
prove futile unless something was also done to reduce the demand.
On that front, a new weapon was available: methadone. Early studies
showed that addicts maintained on methadone were much more likely
to hold jobs and far less likely to commit crimes.
 &HT;    At the time, methadone, like drug treatment in general, was
largely unavailable in most cities. An exception was Chicago, where
a young psychopharmacologist named Jerome Jaffe had set up a
network of treatment programs that was helping get addicts off the
streets. A central intake unit was opened in downtown Chicago, and
addicts appearing at it were assigned to the type of program they
needed _ detox, residential, methadone maintenance,
methadone-to-abstinence and so on.
 &HT;    Impressed, President Nixon announced in 1971 the creation of a
Drug Abuse Prevention office; to head it, he brought in Jaffe from
Chicago. Once in place, Jaffe found that about 30,000 people were
on treatment waiting lists; resolving this problem became his top
priority.
 &HT;    He faced resistance from many quarters, including Congress, the
bureaucracy and his fellow mental-health professionals, but Jaffe _
a brilliant if prickly iconoclast _ managed to outmaneuver them
all. By the fall of 1972, treatment was available to all those who
wanted it.
 &HT;    The impact was immediate. In New York City, the crime rate in
1972 dropped 18 percent, and in Washington, 26.9 percent.
Nationally, the crime rate fell by 3 percent, the first decline in
17 years. Declines were also recorded in the rate of
heroin-overdose deaths, hepatitis transmission and drug-related
hospital visits _ strong testimony to the efficacy of a national
treatment system.
 &HT;    Yet from the moment it was created, that system came under
attack. And so in the 1972 presidential campaign, Nixon began
shifting the focus back toward drug enforcement. During the Ford
and Carter years, the treatment budget suffered from the effects of
both inflation and neglect.
 &HT;    The real turning point came under Reagan. In his view, addicts
were morally responsible for their behavior and therefore
undeserving of government help. As Nancy Reagan toured the country,
urging Americans to just say no to drugs, her husband slashed the
funding for drug treatment and boosted it for drug enforcement.
 &HT;    By the time crack hit in the mid-1980s, the treatment system
Jaffe built had been gutted, and addicts _ showing up at clinics
desperate for help _ were regularly turned back onto the streets,
there to commit more crime.
 &HT;    It was not until the late 1980s that the federal government
finally began pumping more funds into treatment. In fact, the
nation's treatment budget is now larger than it was in the 1970's.
Sadly, our drug problem is larger as well, as long waiting lists
attest. It is time to follow the example of Jaffe and make
elimination of those lists a top priority.
 &HT;    But how much would that cost? According to in-house calculations
by the drug czar's office, filling the nation's treatment gap would
require increasing the federal treatment budget by $3.4 billion a
year. Of the $16 billion Washington now spends to fight drugs,
$10.6 billion goes for supply reduction and $5.4 billion for demand
reduction.
 &HT;    If the overall budget was held constant but the allocation for
these two areas equalized at $8 billion, the demand side would
receive an additional $2.6 billion _ close to the sum in question.
But the Clinton administration _ worried about looking soft on
drugs _ seems little interested in making such a transfer.
 &HT;    By itself, of course, such a change would not solve the nation's
drug problem. Rooted as it is in low-income communities, that
problem is inseparable from the nation's other social ills, like
inadequate housing, poor schooling and unemployment.
 &HT;    Until these conditions are addressed, drug abuse will remain a
fixture of American life. But by following the public health
approach outlined here, Washington could reduce that problem to a
far more manageable scale. When it comes to drug policy, Americans
need not choose between their hearts and their heads; in this area,
compassion is itself cost effective. Clearly, the war on drugs is
not.

 &HT;    For some time now, the Nike swoosh has been showing up in the
oddest of places, dropped like an inadvertent product plug amid the
news of the day.
 &HT;    Just before 39 members of the Heaven's Gate cult swallowed a
suicide brew last year, they laced up their new black Nikes for a
post-mortem chase of a spaceship they believed was trailing the
Hale-Bopp comet.
 &HT;    Benjamin Walker, a victim of the Springfield, Ore., school
shooting in May, was so heavily swooshed in T-shirt and cap in the
photo released by authorities that media outlets felt compelled to
crop him to a tight facial mug.
 &HT;    And then there's O.J. Simpson, the last athlete any company in
the world wants to endorse its product, recently seen wearing a
Nike cap.
 &HT;    Sports are the heart of American culture, says Philip H. Knight,
Nike chairman and co-founder. He has believed this ever since he
started peddling waffle-soled running shoes out of his car trunk
more than 30 years ago. He spoke then in a language understood only
by people who could run a mile in less than five minutes.
 &HT;    Now his company slogans are uttered by presidents and
schoolchildren the world over. By Nike's own research, the swoosh
brand is recognized by 97 percent of Americans, and every man,
woman and child in the United States spends an average of $20 a
year on the company's products.
 &HT;    But be careful what you wish for: The swoosh, never more
ubiquitous, is in turnaround. Having plastered the world with a
corporate icon rivaled perhaps only by Coca-Cola's cursive, Nike is
trying desperately to tone it down, hide it, possibly even lose it.
The week before an anxious annual shareholders meeting, Nike still
looks in the mirror and sees a sleek rebel, but others see a bully
with a beer gut.
 &HT;    ``You can make a lot of mistakes around here, but the brand is
sacred,'' says Knight. ``I messed that up.''
 &HT;    Knight is pacing inside the John McEnroe Building, the
intensive-care ward for the ailing swoosh and the center of power
inside the earthen berm at Nike World Headquarters in Beaverton,
Ore. He is a reddish-haired, somewhat bulge-eyed hypercompetitor;
at 60, he still runs regularly.
 &HT;    When sneakers became a cultural force more than a decade ago,
Knight was dubbed the most powerful man in sports. But he has been
angry much of this year, hearing his company described as the
symbol for everything that is wrong not only with sports but also
with global capitalism itself.
 &HT;    Knight checks in frequently with Gordon Thompson, the company's
lead designer. Thompson's current challenge is the biggest yet: how
to persuade a new generation of consumers to latch onto a brand
trying to reinvent itself after two years of hard hits.
 &HT;    ``Hard to believe,'' says Thompson, showing a chart that
illustrates the evolution of the company logo. ``But the swoosh has
been a stand-alone logo for only four years. We were growing and
growing and growing here in Beaverton, and I guess we didn't
totally realize what happened to this thing that was supposed to be
just a sports logo.''
 &HT;    On new shoes, Thompson has started to shrink the icon down to
just a wisp of a swoosh, barely visible. ``The question we've been
asking ourselves a lot here,'' he says, is whether we should just
go ahead and take the swoosh off. That's been a pretty hefty
debate.''
 &HT;    Just a year ago, on Nike's 25th birthday, coming off the best
financial 12 months in the company's history, there was no hint of
a future without the swoosh. Its fate, the company said, was linked
to the march of sports into every corner of the planet.
 &HT;    ``The 'swooshification of the world' should more appropriately
be deemed the Sportsification of the world,'' Nike officials wrote
in the company's annual report for 1997. ``We will mature in tandem
with the inexorable penetration of sports into the global psyche.''
 &HT;    Brave words. But, as it turns out, the swoosh and sports do not
always move in tandem. Profits at Nike, the world's leading
athletic-shoe-and-apparel maker, plunged 49 percent this fiscal
year, despite record sales of $9.6 billion. More and more Nikes are
being sold by discounters, lowering the profit margin.
 &HT;    The stock price has dropped more than 50 percent this year from
highs of a year before. Two months ago, Nike reported its first
quarterly loss in 13 years, prompting the largest layoffs in
company history and a teary apology from Knight.
 &HT;    Nike still sells more than 160 million pairs of athletic shoes a
year, and nearly one out of every two pairs in the United States.
But the company had pegged its future growth to Asia, where Nike is
one of the most visible American victims of the ongoing economic
crisis.
 &HT;    Worldwide, Nike has about one-third of the total market for
athletic shoes. Its nearest competitors, Adidas and Reebok, are far
behind in the United States and abroad, but Adidas is gaining
ground. And with Michael Jordan, Nike's franchise player, bound for
retirement either this year or next, the company has yet to
discover, or manufacture, anyone even close to him.
 &HT;    Those are just a few of Nike's problems. Purists say that the
company has corrupted sport. Critics of Nike's overseas factories
abound, citing the more than 500,000 workers who often earn about
$1.50 a day. Some of these critics peg Nike's current woes to their
own efforts to tarnish the swoosh _ or the swooshsticka, as the
more rabid Nike-haters call it.
 &HT;    ``We figured out two years ago that the only way to make our
campaign against Nike's labor practices work was to try to make the
swoosh uncool,'' says Medea Benjamin, co-director of Global
Exchange, a San Francisco-based human rights group.
 &HT;    From Day 1, Nike has insisted it is a company for athletes. But
the greatest secret of the sports-footwear-and-apparel business is
that most of the product is bought by people who may want to be
like Mike or Ken Griffey Jr. or the Brazilian soccer star Ronaldo,
but seldom leave the couch.
 &HT;    ``The reason the basketball shoes have worked so well is because
80 percent of the people who buy them never set foot on a
basketball court _ it's a fashion statement,'' says Vince Francom,
a footwear-industry analyst in Seattle. ``The problem with fashion
is that tastes change very quickly. There's a big backlash against
Nike under way. The skateboard generation doesn't want to wear
Nikes because their fathers wear them.''
 &HT;    And it is the swoosh that has become emblematic of all of Nike's
troubles: a fashion statement losing its edge; a sports pyramid
that starts with cheap day labor and ends with poor kids trying to
pony up $140 for the shoes, and the lost innocence of young
athletes.
 &HT;    Knight and his closest executives have heard so much criticism
that they have started to parody it. They've hung anti-Nike
cartoons all over their walls and filled their annual report with
consumers' hate mail. So the inside question is not whether the
swoosh has gotten Nike in trouble, but how quickly to act.
 &HT;    ``We're a company founded by distance runners _ some of them
pretty slow _ so we have a certain amount of patience,'' wrote
Knight in his most recent letter to shareholders. ``Nonetheless, we
prefer to be timed by a stopwatch, not a calendar.''
 &HT;    Inside Nike's main laboratory in the Michael Jordan Building,
product developers are finishing a shoe modeled after a goat's hoof
_ the Goatster, they nicknamed it, designed to grip vertical rock
terrain. It's a niche-market shoe, of course, but who knows how
many eighth-graders might want to have the latest in extreme-sport
fashions.
 &HT;    Nike is also preparing to sell snowboards, boots, hockey sticks
and golf equipment but has dropped a curious new baseball glove.
About one-third of the company's sales last year came from clothes,
gear, watches, eyewear and other products not worn on the foot. The
swoosh is no longer being cloned along with fresh product; instead,
new logos, with separate identities, are sprouting forth.
 &HT;    A new line of Michael Jordan shoes will soon march out of the
factories, carrying the Jordan ``Jumpman'' logo. (For the recent
fiscal year, every major category of Nike footwear sold in America
suffered a decline in sales, except one _ the Jordan brand, which
increased 57 percent.) An Alpha line of shoes and clothing, vaguely
defined as ``innovative,'' will be unveiled later this year,
carrying a new logo _ five dots, a sort of elongated ellipsis.
 &HT;    Everything, it seems, is in play. Nike's most famous slogan,
``Just Do It,'' disappeared for a time this year after a
decade-long run. As it turns out, women did not take to the
admonition quite as enthusiastically as men. ``I Can'' worked
better with women, but it also sounded something like a Special
Olympics plug, and didn't go over so well with men.
 &HT;    ``The saying 'I can' sounds so weak!'' one man wrote to Nike
this year. ``And I ain't weak.'' Just what is the company slogan
these days? ``We use them all,'' says Lee Weinstein, Nike's chief
spokesman.
 &HT;    At a time when other shoe companies are backing away from
endorsements, Nike is still building its roster. It now has more
than 3,000 athletes in the fold worldwide, including 72 percent of
the players in the National Basketball Association, 60 percent in
Major League Baseball and half the players in the National Football
League. More than 200 universities fly the flag of swoosh.
 &HT;    The multipierced illustrated man of basketball, Dennis Rodman,
was once a Nike guy, but the company revoked his swoosh. ``He's a
great player,'' Knight says, ``but he's crazy.''
 &HT;    Shaquille O'Neal, the telegenic center with the high-wattage
smile, showed up a few years ago at the Nike campus for a
get-acquainted session _ swathed in Reebok gear. Things went
downhill from there.
 &HT;    Knight likes winners, of course, but rebels are closest to his
heart. The NBA tried to ban the first Air Jordans (they weren't
considered regulation sneakers), much to the delight of Knight.
There was cheering inside the John McEnroe Building when Casey
Martin, the disabled golfer whose cause Knight took up when it
looked like a long shot, challenged the golf establishment and
became the first man to play the United States Open in a powered
cart.
 &HT;    ``What we are all about,'' Knight says, ``is being against the
establishment.'' Yes, but what happens when you are the
establishment, when the swoosh shows up in more country clubs than
asphalt alleys?
 &HT;    Nike's response has been to try new ways of ``branding.'' Nike,
of course, is not alone in this pursuit. The idea is simply to
create a connection between consumer and product, a link often
having nothing to do with what is actually being sold. Nike has
always tried to sell something more than leather and nylon,
promoting the swoosh as a personal statement.
 &HT;    But the retail world is littered with once-thriving brandings
that have ended badly. L.A. Gear, for example, was an upstart
sneaker company that rode the aerobics craze to dizzying heights,
then crashed when it tried to put its label on too many other
things.
 &HT;    But if the swoosh does not light up advertising focus groups the
way it used to, Nike has another icon that has yet to show a
downside: Jordan. Last June, in the midst of Nike's deepening
troubles, came the most glorious 59 seconds of the year for the
company.
 &HT;    Just when it was said that the greatest person ever to play the
game was past his pull date, the old man did it again. In Game 6 of
the NBA Finals, Nike's franchise player singlehandedly pulled off a
victory _ and the championship _ while wearing a pair of Air Jordan
XIV's, which retail for about $150. The shoe sailed out of stores.
 &HT;    Clinging to Jordan as long as possible, Nike may bring out a
line of Jordan casual shoes, following up with everything from
Jordan socks to suits. Nike executives figure that if Tommy
Hilfiger and Ralph Lauren, neither of whom ever did anything
dramatic on a basketball court, can sell billions of dollars worth
of clothing, the world's best-known athlete can do the same, or
much better.
 &HT;    If Nike takes this step with Jordan, it would mark a huge leap
into relatively unfamiliar retail territory. The last time the
company tried such a thing, selling so-called ``brown shoes'' in
the mid-1980s, it was clobbered. Knight says the company learned
its lesson. Still, Jordan's name is so strong that Nike cannot seem
to resist what they see as his Midas touch.
 &HT;    Jordan, arguably the company's best asset, is planning to tour
the Nike factories in Asia, arguably the company's worst liability.
It was Jordan's idea, says Weinstein, the company spokesman. Jordan
has grown tired of all the questions about factory wages and says
he wants to see firsthand what the fuss is about.
 &HT;    Still, his tour is designed not so much to cheer up factory
hands in Hanoi as to connect with a particular brand of swoosh
consumers: females. The labor issue keeps coming up in focus groups
with girls as young as 12, Nike executives told me.
 &HT;    Knight has seen the future of his industry and it does not have
an Adam's apple. Twenty-five years ago, he says, only 1 in 30
school-age girls played sports; today it's 1 in 5. Nearly 40
percent of high-school athletes are girls. And so the Nike poster
athlete of the new millennium is a female American soccer player,
Mia Hamm.
 &HT;    I ran this name by many of my sports-loving friends, all of them
ESPN habitues, runners and soccer parents. We buy gear and
channel-surf with the best of them. Our reaction was the same: Who?
 &HT;    Then I asked my 11-year-old daughter about Mia Hamm, and she
looked at me as if I were as dumb as a fence post. With Hamm, Nike
has managed to go below adult radar, just as Tom Clarke alluded to
on our run.
 &HT;    Hamm is 26 years old, from Chapel Hill, N.C., winner of an
Olympic gold medal and a World Championship title. She is
beautiful. She can use a verb. She has the right hint of attitude.
And if enough people ever start watching women's soccer _ Nike is
heavily promoting next year's Women's World Cup, to be staged in
the United States _ she may be gold for the Beaverton sneaker
company.
 &HT;    ``Why shouldn't girls around the world say, 'I want to be like
Mia?''' asks Katherine Melchior Ray, the head of Nike women's
footwear.
 &HT;    At Nike, that refrain can sound like a prayer.

<P>
   While deploring the loss of his own privacy this summer,
President Clinton set out boldly to invade mine. His administration
promised me a healthier life if I would accept assignment of a
computer code _ a number or thumb print or retina marker or other
electronic gizmo to be called a UHI, a unique health identifier.
</P>
<P>
   It would instantly disclose my medical record to anyone needing
to treat me anywhere, and also to those who labor to improve
medical science with research.
</P>
<P>
   Before I could even calculate the probable costs and benefits of
UHIs, shouts of protest forced the president to retreat. Americans,
it seems, fear snoops even more than they fear germs. Many, in
fact, responded as if their privacy were an absolute right,
guaranteed by the Constitution and not available for negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   The Bill of Rights does indeed forbid ``unreasonable searches
and seizures'' of my person, home, papers and effects. But
society's increasing invasions of my privacy have taught me that
``reasonable'' is actually a term of taste, describing a shifting
community standard, such as permissible beach attire.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike freedom, which is inviolate, privacy has long been
treated by Americans as a possession that they can trade in the
marketplace. For example, we tolerate the intrusion of telephone
sales calls at dinnertime in exchange for the convenience of phone
service around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   So I thought a UHI was worth considering. As explained by Sheryl
Gay Stolberg in The New York Times, Congress ordered the creation
of a health identifier in 1996, as part of the law that allows
Americans to keep their medical insurance whenever they switch
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration was supposed to devise a UHI plan by
February but did nothing until mid-July, when it scheduled public
hearings instead. Just one week later _ and freshly sensitized by
his president to issues of privacy _ Vice President Gore signaled a
retreat and tossed the matter back to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The proponents of UHIs foresaw vast benefits. With my
identifier, I would always be given reliable diagnoses and be
consistently treated no matter how often I changed doctors or
hospitals; my medical ailments and idiosyncrasies would be
instantly accessible. My medical bills would be streamlined, saving
me money. And adding my records to a national database would
facilitate scientific studies to improve the health of the whole
society.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents argued that the government would never properly
guard my records. Once they leaked, I would run the risk of higher
insurance premiums and possibly job discrimination. Even if
relatively healthy, I would be endlessly badgered by peddlers of
insurance, pharmaceuticals and assorted snake oils. I might grow so
fearful or angry that I would lie to my doctors just to keep my
file pristine.
</P>
<P>
   Bernadine Healy, the former director of the National Institutes
of Health, warned during the debate that government could not be
trusted with such ``sacred secrets'' as sexual practices,
impotence, abortion, depression, suicide attempts, abuse of alcohol
and drugs and a range of ``potentially prejudicial'' illnesses,
procedures and medications.
</P>
<P>
   And the vaunted national research, she said, would violate a
fundamental ethical principle: It would lack the informed consent
of its human subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Those fears were grave enough to tempt me to join the
opposition. But then I reflected on the privacies we have already
traded or given away. I do not think of myself as a ``human
subject'' just because the census regularly records my existence,
types me by income and national origin and counts my children,
toilets and TV sets.
</P>
<P>
   It's an intrusion that mainly benefits commercial enterprises,
but I have always accepted it in exchange for my fair
representation in Congress, for the insight that social statistics
give into American life and for my share of federal subsidies. And
that is only one of the many ways in which I exchange privacy for
some larger benefit.
</P>
<P>
   I have long possessed a unique number to qualify eventually for
Social Security payments. That number now doubles as my Medicare
ID, and Medicare, of course, vigorously logs all my late-life
illnesses and infirmities. The same number links all my income-tax
returns and bank accounts, including one that compiles an
electronic record as it pays my bills.
</P>
<P>
   Several more numbers unique to me record my charge-card
transactions, including meals eaten in and out, movies rented or
attended and cash withdrawn, even in foreign lands.
</P>
<P>
   I value privacy. I once renounced the purchase of a desirable
apartment because I would not let the co-op board members keep
copies of my tax returns. But I have since claimed the right to
inspect the tax returns of political candidates and think it only
fair that my alma mater inspects the tax returns of families
applying for student financial aid. Thus does privacy often yield
to decency, or expediency.
</P>
<P>
   For the safety of children, I no longer object to disclosure of
a nanny's criminal record. To obtain sizable discounts, I no longer
resent registering my medications in the computers of pharmacists
and drug manufacturers. For obviously good reasons, I announce all
my trips away from home with my newspaper deliverer, elevator
operator and building superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   For the convenience of a Visa card, I tolerate the disclosure of
my buying habits to countless merchants who sell and resell my
profile and clog my mailbox with catalogues.
</P>
<P>
   When I can, I resist new computer-age incursions until the
benefit outweighs the cost. But that makes my privacy less a fixed
right than a fluid commodity, more a matter of taste, commerce and
custom than of principle. Americans are obviously not ready to
trade their health records for vague promises of better care, but
as the medical advantages accrue, and insurers make it worth our
while, we will, and should, cut a deal.

 By LARISSA MacFARQUHAR  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 NOTE: Full-length article (3,100 words) available on request  
 &HT;    Joyce Maynard wrote her first memoir, ``Looking Back,'' when she
was 19; now, at 44, she has written her second, ``At Home in the
World.''
 &HT;    In the 25 intervening years, Maynard bought a house, nearly had
a nervous breakdown, lost her virginity to the soundtrack of
``Pippin,'' met Mary Tyler Moore and Muhammad Ali, was raped, got
married, appeared on TV, had three children, emptied her breast
milk into the Atlantic, planted a garden, went broke, had an
abortion, clawed through a heap of garbage looking for a lost
retainer, wrote three novels, watched her parents get divorced and
die, got divorced herself, bought another house, got breast
implants and took them out again, took tennis lessons, sold most of
her possessions and moved from New Hampshire to California.
 &HT;    Over the years, Maynard has related many of these events in her
syndicated newspaper column (now defunct) and in articles for
women's magazines. Oddly, she has been chastised severely, and
often for imagining that any of them could possibly be interesting.
 &HT;    The one thing Maynard has done that everyone agrees is
interesting is have a nine-month affair with J.D. Salinger. The
story, as Maynard tells it in her new book, goes like this.
 &HT;    Twenty-six years ago, when she was a freshman at Yale, Maynard
published an essay in The New York Times Magazine, ``An 18-Year-Old
Looks Back on Life,'' that made her famous. Among the hundreds of
letters she received in response to the article, and to the winsome
photograph of her that appeared on the cover, was one from
Salinger, then 53.
 &HT;    Maynard corresponded with him for several weeks, met him, fell
in love with him and quit school to move into his house in New
Hampshire. He told her that she was very talented, and that he
loved her. They talked about having children. They lived together
through the winter of 1972 and into the following spring.
 &HT;    But she began to irritate him: She was sloppy, she read TV Guide
and little else, she wrote what she thought people would like to
read because she wanted fame and glamour. She was too clenched up
to have intercourse _ she got terrible headaches when they tried.
Finally, disappointed, Salinger sent her away.
 &HT;    For years, Maynard refused to discuss this affair. In doing so
now, she is violating the privacy of a figure who is revered in a
very personal way by a great many people, both for his writing and
for his decision to retreat into the silence that Maynard is
breaking. She will be _ indeed she already has been _ called
shameless and mercenary. Maynard knows this, of course.
 &HT;    In the months preceding the book's publication, Maynard was to
be found at home in Marin County, just north of San Francisco,
editing her manuscript and driving her 14-year-old, Willy, to his
tennis tournaments. She has spent much of her life engaged in
mother activity of this sort _ perhaps she'd be a better writer if
she hadn't.
 &HT;    We met at a match one afternoon and lay on the grass in the
shade with Maynard's unsightly dog and her exquisite son. Maynard
laughed frequently _ a loud laugh with a hysterical edge to it,
involving knee-slapping.
 &HT;    Writing this book had been, for her, the exorcism of a past that
has been festering for years. ``When I first embarked on it, it
felt like such a forbidden thing, like my grandfather eating
pork,'' she said. ``But now I've come to feel there's nothing so
terrible about the truth, and it's such a relief.''
 &HT;    Maynard could now joke about her notoriety. She told me about a
guy she met at a party in San Francisco. ``He came over to me and
said: 'Joyce Maynard! You're the one who lived with. ...''' Maynard
snapped her fingers, imitating the man trying to remember the name.
```Thomas Pynchon?' I said, and he says: `Yeah! That's the one!'''
 &HT;    In a sense Maynard, despite her age, is still unsettlingly
childlike. She is tiny and cute; her dark brown eyes are so big
they are just short of buggy. She wears red-hooded sweatshirts and
little sheepskin booties. But there is also something almost
tangibly maternal about her, as though her skin retained
impressions from her children's bodies.
 &HT;    The thing people say about Maynard is that she takes up a lot of
space. She is not one for keeping quiet about things. She is
dramatic and demands attention. She experiences wild ups and
precipitous downs. She is always getting into car accidents. Once,
in a pizza restaurant with her family, she dumped a glass of beer
over her head by way of communicating her frustration with the
evening.
 &HT;    The pairing of Maynard and Salinger _ the writer whose metier is
autobiography and the writer who's so private he won't even publish
_ was an unlikely one, and the story of their affair makes for
uncomfortable reading.
 &HT;    The Salinger that emerges from Maynard's side of the story is a
rather attenuated figure. We don't see him writing or talking about
writing _ he didn't let her into that part of his life. We see him
only in his relationship with Maynard: the waxing and waning of his
love for her and the eccentric domestic rituals with which the
waning was entwined (his peculiar diet, his meditation, his
practice of homeopathy).
 &HT;    At the time she was living with Salinger, Maynard was at the
height of her fame. She had become the unofficial spokesperson for
the Youth of America, and people were continually calling her up,
asking her to appear on the radio, to write articles, to have her
photograph taken. Under Salinger's influence, she turned many
offers down. Still, Salinger could tell she was tempted, and was
disgusted by her worldliness.
 &HT;    Of course, Salinger's own obsessive privacy was also a form of
caring about the world's opinion, a poisonous sensitivity. In one
of Maynard's few references in her memoir to Salinger's writing,
she observes that his voice in person is Holden Caulfield's voice,
only not so kind.
 &HT;    In her account, the contempt for everything and everyone
``phony'' that in the teen-age Holden betokened a kind of hopeful
idealism seems in the older Salinger rigid to the point of cruelty.
 &HT;    Such an attitude couldn't be more different from that of Maynard
to the outside world. Her relationship with her readers, for
example, is extremely close. One flew her family around in his
private plane. Another recently asked her to officiate at her
marriage. Several have lent her their homes to write in. When she
left New Hampshire for California two years ago, Maynard invited
her readers to a tag sale, and some traveled from distant parts of
the country to attend.
 &HT;    Many keep in almost daily contact with her through her Web site
(www.joycemaynard.com), on which Maynard posts bulletins about her
life and exchanges messages with readers. Occasionally, she posts a
note to explain why she cannot have coffee with absolutely everyone
who wants to meet her.
 &HT;    ``A man wrote me from prison,'' she says, ``to say my stories
about my kids and my family were the one lifeline he had to the
outside world. I wrote back with a picture of my children. He wrote
back to say he'd come to visit us _ maybe fix the wiring in my
house and paint it, maybe marry me _ as soon as he got out on
parole. For the brutal murder of his parents, I learned.''
 &HT;    Still, those who check in regularly can learn, at a virtual
remove, what Maynard's children are doing, what she's been cooking
lately and where she's going on vacation.
 &HT;    One longtime Joyce watcher, a TV producer in New York, explained
to me by e-mail: ``She's the literary equivalent of `The Truman
Show' or Princess Diana _ we've watched Joyce grow up with us. It's
my favorite soap opera: `Joyce's Life.'''
 &HT;    Maynard looks to her readers, and has come to depend upon them,
for love and reassurance. This is, of course, precisely the
relationship to her public that Salinger warned Maynard to avoid,
because praise can tempt a writer to repeat himself. For Maynard,
however, writing per se has never been the point.
 &HT;    Maynard doesn't see herself as a ``literary'' author. She calls
herself a ``journeyman writer'' and an ``entrepreneur.'' She has
produced three novels, the most successful of which _ ``To Die
For'' _ was made into a movie, but most of her time has been spent
turning out articles for money.
 &HT;    She wrote about getting breast implants for Self and then, four
years later, about having them taken out again. When she had an
abortion, she paid for it by writing about it for Redbook. She is
not embarrassed by this.
 &HT;    ``I've assessed sports bras,'' she shrugs. ``I've written about
what the best ride is at Disney World. Last year, Willy wanted to
go to tennis camp, so I got a job _ this was really a new level _
as the spokesperson for Diaper Genie. There was a time when my
husband, Steve, and I were $10,000 in debt from uninsured medical
expenses _ my daughter had broken her arm, we had two babies in
diapers and I just didn't know what I was going to do _ and that
was the moment I thought, I have a trade, a trade that I can ply as
much as if I were a carpenter.
 &HT;    ``It troubles me that people speak about writing for money as
ugly and distasteful. During that first flurry of criticism of this
book, all kinds of people said, `Oh, she's doing it for the money.'
And I thought, Well of course I get paid! Imagine someone
suggesting that a doctor shouldn't get paid!'' (Maynard received a
low-six-figure advance for the book from Picador USA.)
 &HT;    ``But I have to say,'' she continues, ``there was no amount of
money that could have persuaded me to write this story at any other
stage of my life. I've had some very desperate money times over the
years, but it was just never an option. And it wouldn't be
something I'd get into now if I didn't feel that it was the right
thing to do.''
 &HT;    In 1986, Maynard published a collection of her syndicated
newspaper columns in a book, cutely titled ``Domestic Affairs:
Enduring the Pleasures of Motherhood and Family Life.''
 &HT;    On the cover is a photograph of Maynard and her three children
standing in front of their old home in New Hampshire. Maynard's
eyes are red, and her mouth is drawn together in a tight
half-smile. She looks awful. The cartoonish sweetness of her face
is somehow exaggerated and made grotesque by her miserable,
hopeless expression.
 &HT;    She has just been crying, because her husband refused to be in
the picture. The children look restless, glancing off in different
directions. The camera is down near Maynard's knees as though it is
another child at whom Maynard is gazing in mute apology.
 &HT;    This cover was appropriate. In her column, Maynard tended to
portray her life as a homey sitcom, each installment representing a
lovable mistake made and a lesson humbly learned. But all the
while, her marriage to Steve Bethel, an artist, was disintegrating.
 &HT;    ``A good home must be made, not bought,'' she wrote in one
typically precious column. ``In the end, it's not track lighting or
a sun room that brings light into a kitchen.''
 &HT;    It's easy to make fun of essays such as this. And yet there is
something movingly quixotic about Maynard's failed attempt to make
her painful, messy, unflattering life, through her columns, into
happy television. She wasn't wrong, either, about what was required
of her: After her separation announcement, 20-odd newspapers
discontinued her column on the grounds that, as far as family
matters were concerned, she was no longer fit to comment.
 &HT;    Her new book is a departure from her habitual
college-application-essay style. She set out to write it very
plainly, and she certainly did. There's barely an adjective in the
entire thing. There's none of the murky texture of memory; her
story is presented as immediate, undigested experience in the
present tense.
 &HT;    ``I didn't want to tell a reader what to think of any of this,''
Maynard explains. ``I wanted people to live through it.''
 &HT;    Oddly enough, this works. She has, as she intended, let herself
rip, and while Maynard diluted can be cloying, Maynard at full
strength _ in her very shamelessness; in the unrelenting
thoroughness of her self-exposure; in her determination not only to
tell the truth but to tear it open and eviscerate it and squeeze it
until it is bled dry _ is surprisingly powerful.
 -0- 
 &HT;    A few years ago in New York, the writer Francine du Plessix Gray
gave a talk about her forthcoming biography of Louise Colet _ a
poet and a lover of Flaubert's. Flaubert did not come off well in
Gray's account, and among the caddish acts of which she held him
guilty was his hurtful caricaturing of Colet in the character of
Emma Bovary.
 &HT;    Upon hearing this theory, the Daily News columnist Stanley
Crouch stood up in the back of the room.
 &HT;    Writers write about people they know, he protested, and they do
so in ways that are humiliating, nasty, inaccurate and unfair.
That's what writers do.
 &HT;    Is the case of Maynard and Salinger any different? Yes _ but not
because of Salinger's love of privacy. Many people value their
privacy, and there's no reason to privilege Salinger's simply
because, since he is famous, he is obliged to resort to baroque
means to protect it. Nor is this case different because Maynard is
writing autobiography rather than fiction: A fictional portrait can
be every bit as transparent and damaging as a nonfictional one.
 &HT;    No, the reason this case seems different from Flaubert's is
simply that here, Salinger is the better writer.
 &HT;    Imagine the positions reversed. Maynard is the recluse, Salinger
the memoirist. Offered a memoir by one of America's great writers,
who would shed a tear for the violated privacy of Joyce Maynard,
purveyor of minor novels and contributor to women's magazines?

 By TINA ROSENBERG  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Life has changed for the big men of small countries. Gone are
the days when a thuggish Third World leader could find a superpower
to support him, if only because the other didn't.
 &HT;    Thirteen years ago, when Hun Sen first became prime minister of
Cambodia, it was as the puppet of Vietnam and the Soviet Union, and
they were not particularly bothered by political killings or a lack
of elections. (The United States was equally indifferent to the
corruption and abuses of Lon Nol, the Cambodian dictator it
supported in the early 1970s.)
 &HT;    But with the Cold War over, things changed. The United Nations
moved in; an election was held in 1993 and, until last year, Hun
Sen ruled Cambodia in coalition with his co-prime minister and
political rival, Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
 &HT;    In July 1997, however, Hun Sen staged a military coup, ousting
Ranariddh and killing at least 41 of the prince's military and
political allies. This violated the rules of the post-Cold War
world, which call for democracy _ at least in a small and poor
country.
 &HT;    Largely at the urging of Congress, Washington cut off foreign
aid to his government (it continued to help finance Cambodia's
buzzing civil society) and stopped the United Nations from awarding
him Cambodia's U.N. seat.
 &HT;    The Association of South East Asian Nations, or Asean, which had
been considering Cambodia for membership, abruptly froze its bid.
 &HT;    These slights were a problem for a man who craved respect, got
half his budget from foreign aid and had been cut off by the
International Monetary Fund because of corruption. The solution was
an election. He held it on July 26 _ and apparently got everything
he wanted.
 &HT;    International observers took note of the killings of activists
from opposition parties, of Hun Sen's monopoly over television and
radio, of his control of the electoral machinery, of his party's
bribes and widespread intimidation of voters. A nd they approved
the election anyway.
 &HT;    The speed and enthusiasm of the world's embrace raises troubling
questions about whether it is democracy or merely its appearance
that the world demands, and whether the international rules are any
less cynical today than during the Cold War.
 &HT;    I came to Cambodia to watch the election and to interview Hun
Sen, an interview suggested and arranged by his American lawyers
and his public-relations adviser. Bretton Sciaroni, an American
working in Phnom Penh as a lawyer for Hun Sen's Cambodian People's
Party, or CPP, said that Hun Sen's PR makeover began following the
July '97 coup.
 &HT;    ''After the fighting last summer, they (the CPP) couldn't get
their side of the story out,'' he said. Sciaroni was once a lawyer
in the Reagan White House. Now he was standing in a schoolyard on
election morning, waiting for Hun Sen to vote. ``My conservative
brethren don't understand my involvement with the CPP,'' he said.
``I would argue the CPP is more pro-free enterprise.'' There was a
pause. ``But ideology has nothing to do with it. It's all power.''
 &HT;    A succinct description of what drives Cambodian politics.
Sciaroni wrote a long paper giving Hun Sen's side of the coup. To
help in Washington, he hired James C. Stearns, a lawyer with
Porter, Wright, Morris &AMP; Arthur. Stearns, in turn, brought along
the law firm of Arnold &AMP; Porter and David Morey, a corporate
strategist.
 &HT;    A letter filed with the Justice Department's foreign-agent
registry says these consultants will get a total of $550,000 for
five months' work, ending next month.
 &HT;    They held dinners in Washington for visiting CPP officials and
supporters of Hun Sen. ``We're advising them on free elections,''
Morey told me over lunch in Phnom Penh. One of Morey's associates
said, ``We are working with Hun Sen on human rights.'' Speaking of
the time I would have to meet with Hun Sen, Stearns said that his
advisers were rearranging his campaign schedule so I could see him
``with his best foot forward.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    The client is a PR challenge. since the Khmer Rouge came to
power in 1975, Cambodia has suffered under an assortment of
dreadful governments, and Hun Sen has been in all of them. He was
still a teen-ager, a peasant's son, when he joined the Khmer Rouge
guerrillas nearly 30 years ago.
 &HT;    In 1977, while a midlevel officer, he fled to Vietnam. Two years
later, when Vietnam overthrew the Khmer Rouge and installed a
government in Cambodia, Hun Sen, all of 27, was its foreign
minister. In 1985, at 33, he became prime minister.
 &HT;    Hun Sen's government was infinitely better than the psychopathic
terror of the Khmer Rouge. It was, nevertheless, a brutal Communist
dictatorship that used assassination and torture to still its
critics and controlled the country through a network of
party-appointed village chiefs.
 &HT;    The Khmer Rouge guerrillas continued their civil war. To
Washington's undying shame, it supported the Khmer Rouge claim to
be the legitimate government of Cambodia and encouraged China to
give the guerrillas aid _ because they were fighting a regime
aligned with Vietnam and the Soviet Union.
 &HT;    In 1991, Washington, Moscow and Beijing brokered a peace deal
that put an end to the 13-year civil war. The United Nations moved
in with a huge and ambitious peacekeeping operation. It spent more
than $2 billion to organize elections in 1993 and try to restore
democracy.
 &HT;    The CPP lost to Funcinpec, the royalist party led by Prince
Ranariddh, son of King Norodom Sihanouk. Hun Sen then claimed he
had been cheated and threatened to continue the civil war unless he
got a share of power. The United Nations caved in; neither the
United States nor anyone else had the stomach for battles between
U.N. and CPP troops.
 &HT;    So Hun Sen retained his control. It was an important lesson in
the pliability of the international community.
 &HT;    Over the next few years, Hun Sen learned how easy it was to
manipulate the outside world. The United Nations did not demand
that the CPP loosen its control of the army and political
structures. Hun Sen's influence was boosted by the incompetence of
Prince Ranariddh, whose only talent for leadership seemed to be
enjoying the perquisites of power.
 &HT;    But two events in 1997 shattered the world's complacency with
Hun Sen. One was the coup. The other was a grenade attack on a
peaceful political rally in Phnom Penh, killing 16 people and
narrowly missing Sam Rainsy, one of Hun Sen's most ardent critics.
Witnesses saw Hun Sen's bodyguards protect the suspects.
 &HT;    The only investigation _ by the American FBI _ was halted
prematurely and the results have never been released. Even a number
of Hun Sen's supporters told me they believed the bombing was the
work of those close to him.
 -0- 
 &HT;    My interview with Hun Sen took place on Election Day in his new
house, a huge peach-colored stucco mansion about 10 miles from
Phnom Penh. The sitting room was decorated in ornate Louis XIV
style, with white sculpted chairs, crystal chandeliers, marble
floors, flowered rugs and cabinets full of expensive-looking silver
bowls and sculptures. The grounds featured Versailles-style
gardens, fish ponds and coconut groves. He has another house in
town.
 &HT;    The cabinet behind his office desk displays honorary degrees
from American schools _ one, I later learned, from an unaccredited
correspondence school. There were also pictures of his children,
who by fall will all be studying in France and America, one of them
at West Point. Sciaroni, Morey and Stearns sat with us.
 &HT;    Hun Sen was well briefed. His answers were direct and well
organized, mercifully absent the hourlong monologue that normally
kicks off an interview with him. He stuck to his message: Hun Sen,
democrat. I brought up Washington.
 &HT;    ``We agree with each other on democracy, pluralism and respect
for human rights,'' he said, smiling.
 &HT;    The grenade attack on the Sam Rainsy rally, he implied, was
carried out by a member of the royalist party, Funcinpec. Asked
about the coup, he took out two maps from his desk and went through
an intricate account of provocation by Ranariddh and the Khmer
Rouge. When I left he gave me a souvenir watch with his picture on
it.
 &HT;    The centerpiece of Hun Sen's attempt to remake himself as a
democrat was the elections themselves. Although Hun Sen claims
authorship, he had to be pushed into elections by the more moderate
wing of the CPP, which believed the party's nationwide machine
would assure victory. Still, Hun Sen had balked. Even a month
before the election, he was still trying to get Ranariddh's party
disqualified.
 &HT;    The election would not have happened at all without the cajoling
of foreign diplomats, including an unprecedented effort by the
Asean nations, who usually refrain from meddling in the political
affairs of Asian countries. Nevertheless, the campaign climate was
so lopsided that a pre-election statement issued by the National
Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute,
the American monitoring groups, called the process ``fundamentally
flawed.''
 &HT;    Hun Sen's control of broadcasting was one reason. The U.N.
human-rights office in Cambodia, which tracked media appearances,
found that in the month of May, Hun Sen and CPP officials were on
the air 448 times, mostly shown handing out goodies. Funcinpec and
Sam Rainsy party officials had a total of 14 appearances, most of
them treated negatively. Local election committees and polling
stations were run by CPP-appointed village chiefs.
 &HT;    I met people who had been given clothes and food in exchange for
promises to vote CPP, and others who had been threatened, forced to
join the party and warned of the consequences if the CPP lost. The
U.N. human-rights office, which Hun Sen has repeatedly tried to
close, tracked scores of suspected political murders between the
coup and the election. None have been investigated.
 &HT;    The CPP, which won only 41 percent of the vote, boosted its
total from 59 to 64 parliamentary seats _ 2 more than a majority _
by using a new formula to allocate seats. Funcinpec and Sam
Rainsy's party alleged that the vote count had been ruined by
ballot-stuffing, deliberate miscounting or other fraud.
 &HT;    Losers always cry fraud in Cambodia, but there was enough
evidence of mischief during the vote count to make the allegations
credible. It would have taken a thorough investigation to determine
whether the incidents of fraud were widespread enough to have
altered the outcome. Yet the international community quickly
declared the election valid.
 &HT;    The American monitoring groups, who had long-term monitors in
Cambodia throughout the campaign, issued a written statement saying
that the ``relative success'' of balloting and counting could not
negate the violence and unfairness of the campaign, but that the
Cambodian people had overcome those obstacles and held a
``successful exercise in national self-determination.''
 &HT;    That was overshadowed, however, by the news-conference ad lib of
Stephen Solarz, the former congressman and a leader of the
delegation, who said that if the opposition charges proved
unfounded, history could one day call the election ``the miracle on
the Mekong.''
 &HT;    He also implied that after an investigation of the opposition's
claims, Hun Sen should get his Asean membership, foreign aid and
U.N. seat.
 &HT;    The other foreign monitors were even more enthusiastic. Two days
before the vote, a U.N.-sponsored monitoring group with delegates
from dozens of countries said conditions for the elections were
``reasonable.'' The day after the election, it called the voting
and counting ``free and fair to an extent that enables it to
reflect, in a credible way, the will of the Cambodian people.''
 &HT;    Sven Linder, the Swedish diplomat who was the spokesman for the
group, said at the news conference: ``We traced no tensions in the
air. We have not traced any atmosphere of intimidation.''
 &HT;    The positive tone prevailed, perhaps, because most monitors
spent only the week around the election in Cambodia, and for that
period the CPP largely behaved. Cambodians, who are rarely asked
their opinions on anything, had a voter turnout of more than 90
percent and told observers they were thrilled to be able to choose
a good government.
 &HT;    Their dignity and enthusiasm for democracy moved observers. But
the observers' emotional reaction may have caused them to overlook
the unfairness of the campaign. They tended to forget how ill
equipped outsiders were to spot problems.
 &HT;    Villagers were warned not to talk to foreigners. It is
impossible, even at less charged times than Election Day, to have a
private conversation in the claustrophobic and controlled
atmosphere of a Cambodian village, and anyone suspected of talking
about mischief would be in danger.
 &HT;    My visits to villages convinced me that I could gain no idea
what was going on under the surface. Although there was a network
of domestic observers, there were only 500 teams of foreign
observers for 11,000 polling places.
 &HT;    Carol Armstrong, executive director of the U.S.-Thailand
Business Council and an American monitor, said: ``The premature
judgment on the election by the international community was
throwing away 12 months of documented cases of intimidation and
human rights abuses for two days.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    Solarz was crucial to the success of the 1991 Cambodian peace
accords that led to the 1993 elections and was the Clinton
administration's special envoy to Cambodia after the coup. His
involvement may have encouraged him to look on the bright side. He
also had a potential conflict of interest stemming from his
position as a senior counselor at the Washington lobbying firm Apco
Associates.
 &HT;    The Legal Times of Washington reported last year that in 1995
Solarz participated in a pitch meeting with Ranariddh to represent
Cambodia in Washington. Apco then registered with the Justice
Department as a foreign agent representing Cambodia. Apco failed to
get the job, however; perhaps the contract required Hun Sen's
approval.
 &HT;    Solarz denied that these business efforts created a conflict.
``My relationship to Cambodia goes back a long time,'' he said ``If
anything, I'm biased in favor of the opposition.''
 &HT;    The calm of Election Day provided cover for other observers who
had political reasons to endorse the election. U.N. monitors were
never given detailed information about the abuses of the campaign
period before they arrived.
 &HT;    When team leaders from each country met before the election to
write a statement about the campaign period, the Asian delegates
argued against pointing out any problems. When the delegates met
again on counting day, most of the Europeans argued against using
``free and fair.''
 &HT;    But delegates from France and Asian nations _ which included
such dictatorships as China, Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam _ disagreed.
Asean members, in particular, argued that European standards should
not apply.
 &HT;    ``Asean wants to admit Cambodia as a member as soon as they
possible can,'' one Western diplomat said. ``A minimally credible
election would be enough.''
 &HT;    Some who found the election legitimate argued that it had to be
seen in context. The world, after all, had accepted Suharto in
Indonesia, even though his elections featured no real opposition at
all. Intimidation was nothing new in Cambodian political culture.
Ranariddh, moreover, promised nothing better. He preferred golf to
working and surrounded himself with courtiers.
 &HT;    ``The international community decided that Ranariddh was a
buffoon,'' said one Western diplomat.
 &HT;    The American Ambassador Kenneth Quinn was widely perceived as
pro-Hun Sen, but most of the important ambassadors in Phnom Penh
felt that Hun Sen was the key to stability, one high-ranking
Cambodian official told me.
 &HT;    ``They work with who has the power,'' he said. ``Hun Sen became
the interlocutor.'' The quality of the election was irrelevant, and
he knew it.
 &HT;    The United Nations and European nations have their own reasons
for endorsing the election. The U.N. spent more than $2 billion to
try to make Cambodia a democracy five years ago. This year, the
European Union spent nearly $12 million on the election.
 &HT;    ``There's real Cambodia fatigue,'' one European diplomat said.
``It's been 20 years or so, and a lot of effort and time has gone
into helping to fix Cambodia. People are turning away and want a
solution.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    It remains to be seen what kind of solution Hun Sen can offer,
what kind of stability can come from a leader whose strongman rule
is blocking the creation of the institutions needed for long-term
stability. After the election, hundreds of opposition activists
were threatened and fled their villages.
 &HT;    Two weeks ago, Cambodia's own National Election Commission,
which is stuffed with Hun Sen supporters, rejected almost all the
opposition claims summarily. And on Aug. 20, one man died in a
gun-and-grenade attack at a Sam Rainsy-led protest outside the
Interior Ministry.
 &HT;    How the world will treat Cambodia has also not yet been settled,
but it seems as though Hun Sen will be accorded the legitimacy he
wanted. Cambodia has been a laboratory for the international
community, which succeeded in pushing Hun Sen to adopt the
trappings of democracy. And even those may evaporate completely
once the world turns away.
 &HT;    But the real manipulation went in the other direction, as Hun
Sen got the world's endorsement for an election that was neither
free nor fair. The mouse, after all, also trains the scientist.
When he rings the bell, the good doctor brings him cheese.

   &UR; Rampant Tomatoes &LR;

<P>
   Q. My cherry tomatoes are threatening to take over the garden. I
set six-foot stakes beside them when I planted. When that proved
inadequate I set three more stakes around each vine as a sort of
cage. It didn't work. They're all over the place. I love the
tomatoes, but I don't want the vines to smother everything else. Is
there a way to prune them?
</P>
<P>
   A. The original wild tomatoes were small fruits growing on
rampant vines, and most of their cherry-size descendants are
similarly exuberant. Many of them are also, like their wild
relatives, comparatively blight resistant. Full-size tomatoes are
usually slowed down by disease well before they die from frost, but
cherries just keep on going.
</P>
<P>
   Some varieties are bred to stay dwarf, but yours are clearly the
indeterminate, endlessly growing kind. Their numerous secondary
stems, which could have been restricted to two or three in early
summer, are probably so hunky by now that they're almost the size
of main stems themselves, and the even more numerous tertiary stems
are no doubt quite substantial as well.
</P>
<P>
   You can't simply yell ``off with their heads.'' New fruit
production is concentrated on new growth, out at the ends of the
stems, and if you cut off all the growing points you'll be
tomato-free before you know it. At this late date, the best course
is probably to build a makeshift arbor and get them going sideways.
If there's a tree handy, you can run twine from the lower branches
and tie the vines onto it.
</P>
<P>
   Or if you have the time, you can thin the stems. The plants
won't be any shorter when you get through, but they will be less
likely to smother their neighbors. At this point in the season the
main stems are brittle. To avoid breaking them, choose medium-size
side shoots and start pruning them from the top down, clipping off
and removing short sections until you get to the remnants of the
first set of leaves. Make your last cut right above that joint,
leaving a protective stub attached to the parent stem.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, consider growing your cherry tomatoes on a fence or
other support system that permits early horizontal training. Remove
at least some of the suckers (extra stems that grow out of the leaf
nodes). And don't be surprised when hugeness threatens at the end
of the season anyway. Since none of the dwarf sorts are anywhere
near as tasty as the best long ones, you can think of it as the
price you have to pay for flavor.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Away, Cat &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can I dissuade roaming cats from using my flower garden
as their personal litter box and sunning area?
</P>
<P>
   A. Keeping cats from sunning themselves is about as likely as
keeping the sun itself from rising, so concentrate on how lovely
they are lolling about.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, try to make sure your garden doesn't bear too close a
resemblance to a litter box. The most important thing is to remove
cat droppings, since cats go where their noses tell them cats have
gone before. Follow up with a commercial cat repellent, to cover
any smells that may remain. (Don't expect the repellent to perform
like Hercules; you really do have to start by cleaning up).
</P>
<P>
   Once the odor problem is solved, make it hard for cats to dig in
the garden by covering any open soil with dark-colored paper or
plastic mulch. This leaves newly planted soil as the only
vulnerable area. Cover it with chicken wire until the new plants
have achieved fair size and can be protected with mulch.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Saving Impatiens &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Each year in late summer I collect impatiens seeds from hardy
plants. I grow them indoors over the winter in flats placed in
windows facing southeast. I get many good plants by spring and
plant them outside in May, but they never blossom as profusely as
nursery plants. Any explanations or suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   A. Though Impatiens wallerana is famous for blooming in the
shade, the plants flower most exuberantly with a couple of hours of
early morning or late afternoon sun. If yours are someplace truly
gloomy, that might be the problem. But you may be carefully
perpetuating your own special strain of shy-blooming plants. Did
you perhaps neglect to mention that you were saving the seeds of
only the most floriferous examples?
</P>
<P>
   Even if you have made efforts at selective breeding, it is
unlikely that you will beat the seed companies at this game. Those
heavy bloomers are hybrids, crosses between parent strains that are
quite different from each other as well as from their progeny. The
crosses themselves have ``hybrid vigor'' and bloom their little
heads off, but saving their seeds seldom works out _ only a few
replicate their parents. Since creating your own hybrids is no easy
task, when it comes to impatiens you're probably better off buying
fresh seeds (or plants) each year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pruning and Burning &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have been reading a book on pruning. Several times the
author mentions removing dead, diseased or damaged branches and
burning them. He gives no explanation why burning is necessary. In
these days of recycling and compost making, is there a particular
reason he says this?
</P>
<P>
   A. Even a well-made compost pile may not heat up enough to kill
the disease spores on sick plants, so anything of this sort you
remove should leave the garden permanently. And wood takes much
longer than other compost ingredients to decompose, even when
shredded.
</P>
<P>
   Where the law still permits, the easiest way to get rid of this
stuff is to burn it. Fire is a great purifier _ no disease can
survive the heat _ and it reduces huge piles of prunings to small
piles of ash quickly.
</P>
<P>
   If open burning is out, bury any sick material at least a foot
deep, burn it in the fireplace or send it to the landfill. Anything
that isn't sick can go through a chipper (rentable if you don't
have one) and then be used as mulch. Or your town may have a ``wood
dump'' where it can be taken.
</P>

UNIVERSAL SERIAL BUS IS FINALLY PICKING UP PASSENGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Vt., Texas)   (af)  
 By MICHAEL DESMOND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Look behind the back of that sleek new PC, and you'll find a
rat's nest of cords, cables and wires. The mess is more than the
computer's equivalent of a bad hair day, it can make your PC darn
hard to work with.
</P>
<P>
   Devices like your mouse, keyboard, monitor, speakers, printer
and modem all plug into a bevy of connectors on the back of your
PC. Unfortunately, many of those hard-to-reach connectors, or
ports, are in short supply on the average machine.
</P>
<P>
   Try to attach both a laser printer and a color ink jet printer
to your home PC, and you'll find yourself frozen out, since most
PCs have only one printer port.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Jeff Morrill, the customer service manager at Vermont
Information Processing in Colchester, Vt. He found himself using a
printer, Zip drive, modem and digital camera on a PC with a single
serial port and one parallel port. ``It could get really
confusing,'' Morrill said. ``I wouldn't know if the Zip drive was
plugged in or the printer.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem has become worse in the past two years with the
increased availability of cheap, nifty gadgets like scanners,
palm-top computers and portable disk drives. They have to plug in
somewhere, but where? Chances are, you end up unplugging one device
to make room for another. This is progress?
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, a solution is at hand in the form of the Universal
Serial Bus, or USB. A fixture on Apple's new iMac, most notebook
computers and nearly every desktop PC sold since 1997, USB
technology lets all your devices plug into a single connector _
much the way a phone, modem and fax machine can all plug into a
phone jack.
</P>
<P>
   The USB consists of a pair of tiny rectangular ports and
software that allows your system to recognize devices after they
are plugged in. Devised by an industry group led by the Intel and
Microsoft corporations, the new connection adds some much-needed
smarts to your system, reducing the hassle of setting up new
devices.
</P>
<P>
   The downside is that older peripherals not configured to USB
will not work in these ports. So that great MacIntosh printer you
bought two years ago is useless with your iMAC, which has only USB
and SCSI ports.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do the connectors on older hardware not fit in the
ports, but devices must also include USB-specific circuitry and
software. One exception: You can run some printers through a USB
port by buying a USB-to-printer converter cable.
</P>
<P>
   But not all models will work reliably using this fix, so be sure
to ask about compatibility before making a purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the selection of USB-tailored products has grown
tremendously in the past couple of months, thanks in part to
Windows 98. That new version of the Microsoft operating system has
finally made USB devices a snap to install and operate. (Earlier
versions of Windows didn't recognize USB devices or provided
less-than-complete USB support.)
</P>
<P>
   A survey by the market research firm Dataquest of San Jose,
Calif., estimated that in 1997 only half a million USB devices were
sold into a market of about 60 million PCs with available USB
ports.
</P>
<P>
   ``My report, which originally came out in February or early
March, said that USB ports are about as lonely as the Maytag
repairman,'' said Nathan Brookwood, who wrote the Dataquest survey.
But now, he said, the USB is ready to take off. ``We see it going
from 10 million devices this year to maybe 50 million next year and
100 million the following year,'' he said. ``So it's really ready
for prime time.''
</P>
<P>
   Computing novices probably have the most to gain from USB, since
it lets a PC automatically detect and install hardware, improving
upon the existing upon Microsoft's hit-and-miss ``plug and play''
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Hook up your scanner, for example, and your system automatically
identifies the newcomer and fires up the system software needed to
make it run. There are other advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Many USB-based products don't need a separate power cord _
modems, scanners and other devices can draw juice through the USB
wire. Eliminating those power cords helps reduce cable congestion.
Also, USB ports are faster than the existing ports on the back of
your system, not that you will notice it much. The devices that USB
serves _ keyboards, printers, modems and the like _ don't have a
lot to gain from a faster wire.
</P>
<P>
   What's most compelling about USBs is that they help insure that
you'll never again run out of places to plug in the extra stuff you
want to attach to your computer. While most PCs ship with just two
USB ports, some USB devices include their own port for connecting
to other devices _ called daisy chaining.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, users will buy modules, called hubs, that connect
to the USB port and present four or more additional ports for other
devices to plug into. In theory, 127 peripherals may be attached to
your PC this way.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   According to the Dataquest survey, monitors are among the more
popular USB products: 8 percent of all monitors sold this year will
be USB-compatible, a figure Dataquest estimates will rise to 50
percent in 2001. The digital USB pathway allows users to adjust
monitor display settings using easy-to-follow Windows-based
software _ a vast improvement over the tiny push buttons and
cryptic onscreen menus now common.
</P>
<P>
   Other popular USB-compatible items are digital cameras (10
percent in 1998), PC telephony systems (37 percent) and PC Video
cameras (10 percent) like Intel's Create and Share and Connectix'
QuickCam VC.
</P>
<P>
   USB-compatible cameras eliminate the need for sluggish parallel
port connections or pricey add-in cards. Over the next six months,
expect virtually every class of external device to come in a USB
version.
</P>
<P>
   Even speakers are moving to this technology, promising cleaner
audio because they bypass the sound card and accept digital signals
directly.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, before you decide to switch to USB, here are some
questions to ask:
</P>
<P>
   _ Are you running Windows 98? If not,it's best to stay away from
USB until you upgrade. Product support in Windows 95 is limited and
users have complained about crashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Invariably, if I had the patch installed, Windows was just not
stable,'' said Bob Lionel, a systems support professional with a
Dallas-based software company. The troubles, Lionel said, largely
disappeared when he switched to Windows 98. ``In fact, that was the
specific reason for me upgrading to Windows 98, to get rid of the
problems with that stupid USB patch.''
</P>
<P>
   USB is not supported at all under Windows 3.x or NT 4.0, however
NT 5.0 will work with USB peripherals when it arrives next year,
according to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   _ Can you find the products you want? USB product selection is
improving rapidly but more in some areas than others. In
particular, keyboards, mice and printers remain hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   _ Are you willing to pay more for USB-compatible devices?
According to Brookwood, you will, at least for the next few months.
As more products hit the market, prices should drop. And, because
USB versions of scanners and modems do not require the expense of
separate power chords and converters, the standard could even help
lower prices slightly.
</P>
<P>
   _ Have you considered a USB hub? Remember, most PCs ship with
two built-in USB ports. If you intend to buy several USB devices,
you'll probably have to add more ports. Expect to pay $50 to $75
for a hub that adds four to eight ports to your PC. Manufacturers
include Belkin and Computer Access Technology Corp.
</P>
<P>
   _ Are you buying a new PC? If so, you should seriously consider
committing to USB up front. However, while system vendors have
started to offer USB devices, these products are often sold as
options or add-ons.
</P>
<P>
   You should specifically ask about available USB devices when
shopping. If your vendor can't provide these products, consider
shopping elsewhere or buying the desired devices separately.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: the immediate future of desktop computing
includes USB. Over the next few years, PCs will likely follow the
path blazed by the iMac. Gone will be the various ports and plugs,
replaced by a pair of USB ports and a monitor-mounted USB hub.
</P>
<P>
   If you make your move to USB now, you can be sure that your new
devices will have a port to plug into when you buy a new system
three or four years down the road.

A SECOND LOOK AT AOL, THE REFURBISHED MAYFLOWER OF THE NET 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every society has its own class system, and so it is with the
Internet. So, of course, the people who were first on line _ the
early settlers who can reminisce about the good old days of the
Arpanet _ get the most points for snob appeal. They are the online
equivalent of those who claim that their ancestors were on the
Mayflower.
</P>
<P>
   It is this class system that explains the simmering resentment
among early adopters toward America Online. That online service has
long been a kind of wired Ellis Island, a gateway through which the
great unwashed arrive on the Internet shore. I felt no gratitude to
America Online for easing my own online arrival a few years ago
because I, too, wanted desperately to be mistaken for the kind of
blueblood who had been on line since the early days, a charter
member of the Daughters of the Internet Revolution. It never
occurred to me to applaud the service for creating a painless
gateway with its easy installation and setup process and its
See-Dick-Run interface.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as I could, I traded in my place on AOL's crowded
network (where I might as well have been
michele43333759329602349579873493(AT)aol.com) for an e-mail address
with more cachet. Around the end of 1995, I abandoned AOL
altogether, complaining about the clunky nature of the service's
proprietary browser, the paucity of sophisticated e-mail features
and the relentless stream of advertisements that greet the masses
upon logging on.
</P>
<P>
   Only in recent weeks, as America Online began with great fanfare
to roll out the new 4.0 version of its software, have I looked
inside my soul and wondered, Was I too quick to judge? After all,
the service has attracted more than 13 million customers, a number
that keeps growing. The only fair thing to do would be to test the
4.0 version _ as objectively as possible, given my social-climbing
tendencies _ to see if the AOL software could meet my needs.
</P>
<P>
   Truthfully, I did not think I would be interested in many of the
new features that AOL was most proud of, like the new design that
mimics a browser or even a channel guide that makes it easier to
navigate through such topics as Sports, News or Lifestyles. Even
the new feature that enables users to change screen names without
logging off held no appeal for me: I don't use aliases, nor do I
allow my daughters to use my account.
</P>
<P>
   The only online activities I engage in regularly are e-mail and
Web browsing. No gaudy welcome screen greets me when my modem
connects. Instead, I rely on a tiny, tasteful icon depicting two
linked computers to flash on the bottom of my screen, signaling
that it is time to open either my e-mail program or my browser.
Could AOL do better than my current minimalist setup?
</P>
<P>
   First, I had to download AOL 4.0 from  &UR; www.aol.com &LR; . Although
the final version for Windows was released at the end of July,
production is still under way on the CD-ROM's. AOL expects to start
mailing millions and millions of the disks within the next month,
however, just in time for my cranky friend Ron Reason to continue
his annual Halloween tradition of handing them out to unsuspecting
trick-or-treaters in his South Florida neighborhood. (The Macintosh
version will lag by a few weeks, an AOL spokeswoman said.)
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, I was surprised that downloading the 4.0
version _ which warned that it might need as much as 17.5 megabytes
on my hard drive _ seemed to take forever. Assuming that the
process would end quickly, I sat at my desk, waiting. I flipped
through the entire autumn Pottery Barn catalog. I phoned the
toll-free number to get some information about velvet drapes. Still
downloading. Called back to order the drapes. Still downloading.
Worried drapes would be wrong color. Phoned to request complete set
of drapery fabric swatches (free). Rebuffed in attempts to get
Pottery Barn saleswoman to confirm whether this year's ``plum''
differs from last year's ``plum _ 1198134.'' Still downloading.
Composed frosty letter in my mind to Pottery Barn.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for the people at Pottery Barn's customer service
department, the download was completed before I wrote the letter. I
phoned Jeanie Ryan, a spokeswoman for America Online, to accuse her
of forcing me to purchase unnecessary window treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``One hour? That's not bad _ you're on the good end,'' Ms. Ryan
said. She explained that Microsoft's Internet Explorer was
integrated with the new AOL software so users who have not already
installed the browser could wait for up to three hours for the
package to download. ``We thought people would run away
screaming,'' Ms. Ryan confided. (Or at least just wait to go
trick-or-treating!) ``Yet millions of people have sat through it,
and we're like, oh my gosh.'' The good news was that installation
and setup took me just three minutes more.
</P>
<P>
   Although determined to ignore the bright colors of the welcome
screen, I had to admit that AOL 4.0's newly designed toolbar across
the top of the screen was very helpful. Click on any of the three
buttons on the left to use e-mail. Click on My AOL, then
Preferences, then Marketing to speedily cancel all those ``valuable
product and service offers'' that AOL and its partners serve up via
e-mail, phone solicitation, the Postal Service and pop-up on-screen
windows. And AOL 4.0 eliminates many of the tedious delays found in
earlier versions. To start surfing the Net instantly, type a Web
address in the space right under the icons. If you prefer another
browser, it is easy to minimize the AOL window and open Netscape
Navigator in its place.
</P>
<P>
   Be aware, however, that AOL stores on its servers copies of Web
pages that its users request. What this means is that AOL stores
copies of Web pages on its own computers so the pages are more
quickly accessible to the bazillions of AOL users whose
simultaneous attempts to call them up might otherwise cause an
online traffic jam. The drawback is that some pages in the caches
may be out of date. AOL guarantees updates once every 24 hours, but
stored copies of news sites appear to be updated much more
frequently. I did a quick check of five news sites _ www.news.com,
www.cnn.com, www.nytimes.com, www.wsj.com and www.pathfinder.com _
and found that AOL's cache pages were as up to date as the pages I
viewed with a different online provider.
</P>
<P>
   But the main thing that bothers me about AOL was that the e-mail
features are still not robust enough. Unlike my Eudora e-mail
program, AOL has no function that allows me to sort messages by
date, sender, status, priority, label, size _ or even by various
shades of plum. Nor does it allow me to attach a preconfigured
signature file _ you know, the kind that gives my name, phone
number and a quote from Descartes. ``We're working on that,'' Ms.
Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   I won't trade in my current setup for AOL yet. But, amazingly, I
did manage to snag the simple and understated slatalla(AT)aol.com
as my new e-mail address. I'll be proud to give it out, even to my
snootiest Internet friends.

 By EDWARD R. LIPINSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walls are one of the basic structural elements of any dwelling.
Most walls are framed with 2 by 4's but where extra-thick
insulation is required, exterior walls may be framed with 2 by 6's.
</P>
<P>
   The top and bottom pieces of the frame are horizontal timbers
called the top and sole plate. Some walls, particularly
load-bearing walls, have double top plates. The vertical members
within the frame are called studs and are usually spaced 16 inches
apart on center. Many building codes require installing short
horizontal pieces of wood between the studs; their purpose is to
prevent the spread of fire through the wall's airspaces.
</P>
<P>
   Walls that have openings for doors or windows require additional
framing to transfer the weight above the aperture to the
surrounding studs. The header spans the top. In a doorway, the
header is supported by jack studs. The bottom of a door opening may
be open or the sole plate may be left in place. The bottom of a
window frame has a horizontal member called the rough sill. Short
studs called trimmers run vertically from the sill to support the
header.
</P>
<P>
   While the majority of homes are framed with wood, many builders
are starting to use steel-frame construction. Cold-formed steel
pieces are cheaper than wood, they are rot- and insect-resistant,
and they are free of knots and splits. Steel is also fire
resistant, and steel-framed homes can resist the ravages of wind
storms and mild earthquakes better than wooden framed ones.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, many carpenters are not experienced in working
with this material, and while steel-framing techniques are similar
to wood framing, assembling steel walls requires a different set of
tools. Also some local building codes have not set standards for
residential steel-frame construction. Therefore, a steel-framed
house may have to be approved by a qualified engineer before it is
ready for occupancy.
</P>
<P>
   The wall frames in older houses were covered with lath strips
and plaster. Today, walls are sheathed with plasterboard panels
that are nailed or screwed to the frame. Standard thickness for
plasterboard are 3/8 inch, 1/2 inch, and 5/8 inch.
</P>
<P>
   Walls can be divided into two categories: load-bearing walls and
non-load-bearing walls. Load-bearing walls support the floors above
and also the roof and attic. They transfer the weight from above to
the foundation. Non-load-bearing walls function as partitions
between rooms. All outside walls are load- bearing walls, while
interior walls may fall into either category.
</P>
<P>
   Since load-bearing walls are a vital part of the support
structure, any attempt to modify them could compromise the
structural integrity of the house. Generally, load-bearing walls
run perpendicular to the floor and ceiling joists and are aligned
above support beams. Most, but not all, have double top plates.
These are general guidelines, and there are exceptions; so it is
important to accurately identify a load-bearing wall before
altering it in any way.
</P>
<P>
   When you plan to work on the walls, whether it be installing a
new window, hanging shelves or even mounting a picture, you should
begin by locating the studs.
</P>
<P>
   The simplest way to do this is to tap along the wall with your
knuckle and listen for a change in sound. This works well with
walls constructed of wallboard but is less effective with a
lath-and-plaster wall. The tapping technique will only reveal the
general location of the stud. To find the edges of the piece,
you'll have to drill a series of small holes until the drill meets
resistance. Later you can fill the holes with spackling compound.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes you can find studs by sighting along the wall with a
strong spotlight. Hold the light at a low angle against the wall
and look across the surface for depressions where the nails were
driven through the wallboard.
</P>
<P>
   You can also invest in an electronic stud finder. These work
well on plasterboard walls, but they are not effective on plaster
walls or walls where the wallboard has been mounted with adhesive.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Weekday mornings for Jessica Nierenberg, 23 a research manager
at a market research company in San Francisco, usually begin with a
dash to her neighborhood bus stop for a 30-minute ride to her
office in the city's financial district downtown.
</P>
<P>
   By 8:30 she is at her desk, pouring herself a bowl of breakfast
cereal and firing up her computer for a glimpse at what the planet
has wrought while she slept.
</P>
<P>
   What greets her on her computer's screen is selected and
displayed by My Yahoo, a free service by Yahoo, the giant Internet
information company based in Santa Clara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   My Yahoo shows Ms. Nierenberg how many e-mail messages she has
waiting to be read and a sampling of news headlines _ she can
decide to call up any of the articles on domestic, political and
international news for a more detailed look. Weather forecasts for
her area and for Boston, her hometown, are parked in a corner of
the screen.
</P>
<P>
   That wake-up dose of Internet offerings is, more or less,
created specifically for Ms. Nierenberg, who, while computer savvy,
doesn't consider herself a computer nerd (she does not have a
computer at home, for instance). What she gets is a tailor-made
collection of information that she has informed Yahoo she wants to
get regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely saves me time,'' said Ms. Nierenberg, whose work
requires her to be on a computer for at least eight hours a day.
``It's nice to be able to push one button whenever I log on and to
get all of this.''
</P>
<P>
   The process that delivers all of that daily digital data to her
and millions more is called personalization, the newest wave
washing over the ever-changing shores of the Internet. After years
of shaky starts, personalization promises to re-emphasize the
personal in personal computing.
</P>
<P>
   Without a ``personalized page,'' as she likes to call it, Ms.
Nierenberg would have to resort to laboriously searching the
Internet herself, plowing through more than 650,000 sites on the
Web alone.
</P>
<P>
   One of the chief ideas driving personalization, many Internet
experts say, is that the Internet, a victim of its own success, has
become too voluminous for most people to handle comfortably and
efficiently. If you're not using personalization, said Joe Kraus,
senior vice president and co-founder of Excite, ``you are not
taking advantage of the medium.''
</P>
<P>
   The thinking behind personalization goes something like this:
What if your computer ``knew'' you, had a reasonable sense of your
online interests and preferences and could respond to them? Forcing
the computer to conform to your information needs rather than
forcing you to conform to the computer's requirements is a step,
many agree, toward realizing the vision that Nicholas P.
Negroponte, director of the Media Laboratory at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, calls ``the daily me.''
</P>
<P>
   Services like My Yahoo, My Excite and even the set-top Web
cruiser My Web TV (like other personalized features offered by
America Online and the Microsoft Network, it is part of a service
that requires a monthly fee) are increasingly fetching the kinds of
content that their users say they want: specific types of news,
weather forecasts, sports scores and schedules, stock quotations,
horoscopes, television schedules, movie show times and state
lottery results, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these services also feature lists of users' favorite Web
sites, chat rooms and message boards, along with daily health tips,
travel alerts and online reminders of occasions like anniversaries
and birthdays of relatives and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is empowering,'' said Steve Boxer, a computer consultant
who owns Pachyderm Consulting in Brooklyn, speaking of his
experience with personalization. ``It really molds your computer to
your interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The first personalization service from a major online company
was the Microsoft Network, or MSN. When it began in the fall of
1995, it offered users a relatively primitive capacity to customize
the kinds of information they received.
</P>
<P>
   In January the following year, Excite created My Excite, which
was followed that summer by My Yahoo. In July, Netscape, the
leading Internet browser company, started offering My Netscape.
While America Online offers its members very limited
personalization with My AOL, a company spokesman said AOL will
begin a much more fully featured service called My News in the next
few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Competition among the companies offering personalization is
intense, resembling at times the browser wars between Netscape and
Microsoft. Refinements by one are often followed quickly by similar
refinements by the others.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the personalization services refused to
disclose just how many dollars each company has poured into
creating and continually tweaking its service. But Kraus did say
that his company, Excite, had spent a ``significant investment in
terms of manpower, money, hardware and engineering time'' in
creating its version of personalization, called My Excite.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will the companies reveal the number of subscribers for each
service. ``It has exceeded some expectations,'' said Henry Sohn, a
senior producer for personalization for Yahoo. ``Part of that is
due to the overall growth in the Internet with each quarter. But it
is clear that personalization services are really popular.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The promise of personalization had been on the lips of computer
visionaries for years, even while the Internet struggled to find
its identity. In the mid-1990s, software makers began selling
off-the-shelf products like Pointcast Network that automatically
log on to the Net, download categories of information broadly
defined by users and then log off.
</P>
<P>
   These products, known as ``push'' technologies, began falling
out of favor because they tended to be resource hogs and to deposit
overwhelming amounts of information on computer hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   As many began to complain that push information was not
selective enough, some users started looking for something that
could pull from the Internet more specific information that matched
their interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, people didn't know what they wanted, so they wanted
things pushed at them,'' said Rob Bernstein, a senior editor at
Yahoo Internet Life, a monthly magazine about Net use. ``The Net
pretty much rejected that idea. Pull it down. That is the idea of
personalization.''
</P>
<P>
   But the idea of personalization, some experts acknowledged, has
been difficult to sell. Part of the problem, said David Sze, vice
president for network programming and content at Excite, is that
personalization is hard to describe. The concept, he noted, tends
to ``come off very soft, vague.''
</P>
<P>
   Using personalization is hardly automatic. First, you must
register for it. (Many of the companies offering personalization,
including Excite, Yahoo and MSN, have been trying to entice
potential users by including very visible links from their popular
home pages to their personalization pages.)
</P>
<P>
   Registration also means filling out an online questionnaire that
can take anywhere from a few minutes to a half-hour to complete.
(My Excite goes another step, giving brief descriptions of why it
requests certain information. It says, for example, ``Your birth
date is used to provide your horoscope.'')
</P>
<P>
   Designers of personalization services noted that the more
information users provided about themselves, the more personalized
the service would be.
</P>
<P>
   The My Yahoo form is much more tedious when it asks users to
choose the information they want and how it is to be displayed.
Each user enters preferences for a front page and pages for
subjects like health, entertainment, business, chat and message
boards.
</P>
<P>
   Each subject page has a dozen slots, and each slot holds a
pull-down menu offering 36 choices of content, like sports
scoreboards, information about vitamins and herbs, and news
headlines.
</P>
<P>
   A user may choose one menu item for each slot. Each selection
leads to that categories of information being displayed and updated
whenever the personalized pages are viewed. My Yahoo goes even
further, pressing for even more detail about a user's ``specific
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The categories there, like news, life styles, music and
shopping, are more finely tuned. The answers may very well
determine whether the Epicurious Web site for fine cooking appears
on your finished page rather than Gamespot, which is popular among
computer twitch gamers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps us in a number of ways to offer a service that users
find more relevant,'' Sohn at Yahoo said of the questionnaire.
</P>
<P>
   Once the services have an idea of what users want, they extract
the information from various sources. To do that, they use
relationships with news operations and other partners as well as
their own powerful search engines. In most cases, as with My Yahoo,
My Excite and My Netscape, the information is stored in central
databases.
</P>
<P>
   When someone goes on line and types in a user name and a
password, a cookie _ an identifying tag stored on the user's
computer _ tells the personalization service who is requesting
information. Based on what is in the cookie (for My Netscape it is
a 16-digit number) the information is unlocked from the database
and sent in a fraction of a second to the user.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the services regularly update their information and use
both machines and people to match the right streams of information
with the right users, personalization managers say.
</P>
<P>
   Just how these services actually work depends on closely held
proprietary technologies, but many personalization operators agree
that the services have been made possible by advances in database
hardware and software in the last several years, by high-speed
user-indentification systems and by the capacity to generate pages
on the fly over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making it easy for people is our overarching design point,''
said Eckart Walther, product manager for My Netscape. ``It makes
information come to you rather than you going to the information.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Beckord, 26 a research associate for an investment bank
in San Francisco, uses My Yahoo to check his stock portfolio and to
glance at news about his investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``For each portfolio, I have it customized to display what I
want, quote the volume, and below that it shows the news,'' he
said. Beckord also has the service set up as his default page, so
it is the first thing he sees when he goes on line at work or at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Users like Beckord are very useful to Internet companies, which
is why the companies invested in personalization. The detailed
information users give them about exactly what they want to see on
line serves as a kind of survey.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The information helps personalization managers decide what kinds
of content to add, maintain or remove from their offerings. More
important, many of the same managers said, the information makes it
possible to match the advertising to users' interests and needs.
</P>
<P>
   Much as sporting goods manufacturers know that they have a
better chance of reaching their market by advertising on ESPN, the
national cable sports network, rather than with general-interest
programs, advertisers are looking for much of the same result by
having their advertisements sent over the Internet to people whose
declared interests identify them as likely customers, explained
Sze, of Excite.
</P>
<P>
   Sohn, of Yahoo, offered an example. ``If we know someone is not
interested in travel,'' he said, ``then we are not likely to
display an ad from an airline or travel agency.'' And the better
his company is able to aim advertising, he added, the more it can
charge for that advertising.
</P>
<P>
   But Sze said the use of personalization as an effective
advertising tool had just begun. ``The true value of this is not
being realized the way it is going to be,'' said Sze, adding that
on a scale of 1 to 10, personalization's use of advertising was in
the 3-to-5 range. But, he said, Excite is preparing to step up its
use of targeted advertising on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Walther also noted that personalization made good business sense
because it was a way to capture more users, people who are
approaching the Internet differently from their early-adopter
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing a lot more practical use of the Web,'' he said.
``A lot of people don't go on the Web to just have fun.'' He said
people tended to care more about how much time they were on the
Internet and how much they accomplished. Personalization, he said,
especially speaks to such users.
</P>
<P>
   And, added Boxer, the New York computer consultant, many new
Internet users start with personalization services and keep
returning to those companies. ``Everyone has to start someplace,''
he said, ``and the people who control the starting place hold some
very valuable real estate.''
</P>
<P>
   Because personalization requires the user to give a series of
very specific preferences, there are growing concerns about what
companies will do with all this new information.
</P>
<P>
   Sohn and other personalization service operators said the
industry followed strict guidelines to protect users' privacy. Many
of the companies' policies regarding privacy are clearly stated on
line and linked to the questionnaires.
</P>
<P>
   ``We care very deeply about privacy,'' Sohn said. ``We go
overboard to make users aware that we don't sell usage information
to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Another objection to the current personalization services is
that they simply do not go far enough. Walter Bender, associate
director of the MIT Media Lab, said he would like to see additional
levels of integration between, for example, online information and
personal online calendars.
</P>
<P>
   The result, he said, would be more sophisticated services that
would not only deliver tailored content but would also match that
information with what a user was actually doing. You're taking a
business trip to the Caribbean? Your computer would start
delivering news, weather and travel information about the Caribbean
as your departure date approached.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, many Internet experts say, personalization is
expected to be the buzz on the Internet for years to come, as it is
tweaked and refined along the way. ``It's not going to go away,''
Sze predicted.
</P>
<P>
   It is simply a matter of Internet destiny, others say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only medium,'' Kraus said, ``that is inherently
personalizable.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   (italics)At first glance the online personalized services might
all look the same, but don't be fooled by the hypertext. They're
not. Here are thumbnail descriptions of some of the pros and cons
of a range of these eager data gatherers.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MY EXCITE: www.excite.com &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Getting started: Once users complete a simple online
questionaire, My Excite automatically becomes the home page for
general purpose Excite Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Advantages: Most of the daily list of news stories are provided
by Reuters and United Press International with often intriguing
links to related stories from more than 250 other online sources.
</P>
<P>
   The local events finder, a new feature, is helpful in tracking
and displaying forthcoming concerts, festivals, plays and the like.
</P>
<P>
   An optional word processor, the very basic Notepad, comes in
handy for jotting down a Web address or observation.
</P>
<P>
   Disadvantages: The layout of My Excite's personalized pages _
crammed with boxes, banners and fine print _ is busy and not always
easy to follow. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MY YAHOO: www.yahoo.com &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Getting started: To get the most from My Yahoo, users must fill
out an exhaustive series of questionnaires, mostly in the form of
pull-down menus, each offering 36 choices, from lottery results to
favorite chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Advantages: The most expansive personalization service, My Yahoo
offers 11 major sections on a task bar stripped across its top
front page.
</P>
<P>
   Each section can contain mountains of information along with
online applications, like an international currency converter, as
well as a useful online map maker.
</P>
<P>
   A handy bookmark box stores Web sites. Visual clutter, including
banner ads, is kept to a minimum. My Yahoo can be set up as default
browser page.
</P>
<P>
   Disadvantages: For true data addicts, My Yahoo is very likely to
be deliciously overwhelming. For practically everyone else, its
very richly stocked pages of information and services might be too
much. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MY NETSCAPE: www.netscape.com &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Getting started: Only basic information, like name, e-mail
address, sex and age range, is required. Users then select the
information they want from a handful of choices in three
categories: News, Information and Tools.
</P>
<P>
   Advantages: Efficient, fast and simple for users who want to see
the world at a glance. During setup, each selection is linked to an
example of what the information would actually look like if it was
included. The layout is clean and logical. For those using the
Netscape Web browser, My Netscape can easily be set up as the home
page.
</P>
<P>
   Disadvantages: A newcomer to personalization, My Netscape is
considerably more modest than other services.

<P>
   HILLSDALE, N.Y._ The flier mailed out this summer to scores of
parents may have been anonymous, but it did not mince words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents of teen-age girls,'' it said, ``what are you going to
do if your daughter comes homes pregnant and says, `If the
principal can get pregnant without getting married, why can't I?'''
</P>
<P>
   The content of the flier, maligning the local elementary school
principal for having a baby and then marrying the baby's father,
might have unsettled any number of towns and school districts,
especially a small community rooted in the traditional values of
the farm and deeply concerned, like much of America, with
preventing teen-age pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, Hillsdale, Copake and the other eight
Columbia County towns that send students to the Taconic Hills
school district took the matter in stride. Donna Rich, who as Donna
Straub gave birth in June 1997, then married the girl's father last
May, was not fired or suspended.
</P>
<P>
   There was private hand-wringing by a few community leaders on
whether the incident might undermine the school system's effort to
teach moral values, but hardly a public murmur until the flier was
sent out. And most people who wrote to the local newspaper about
the flier seemed more upset that anyone would make such a personal
attack without having the courage to sign his or her name than
about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Mrs. Rich started her sixth year as principal,
buttonholing returning teachers, warning parents of kindergartners
what to expect with bus schedules and immunizations. ``They really
will be fine, moms,'' she reassured parents skittish about leaving
toddlers. For most parents, her pregnancy is squarely behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents believe that the issue's fading away says much
about the ability of people in this region of rolling farmland and
weekend homes, just west of the Berkshires and the Massachusetts
state line, to make moral distinctions. People here supported Mrs.
Rich because of the particular circumstances she found herself in:
she and her future husband were estranged spouses struggling
through divorces that dragged on for four years.
</P>
<P>
   They realized that Mrs. Rich was not a principal of high school
students, but of those too young to appreciate the circumstances
surrounding her pregnancy. Even those who might have looked askance
at Mrs. Rich's having a baby with a man to whom she was not married
understood that the job performance and personal life can be
separate realms.
</P>
<P>
   Esther Hartell Chappuis, minister of Craryville United Methodist
Church, said: ``The fact is that ultimately this principal has been
a good principal, and she has been true to her affections. She did
marry the man. There is commitment there. We don't live in the best
of all worlds, we live in the reality of today.''
</P>
<P>
   In a soul-searching that tells much about American thinking in
the waning summer of 1998, many here also weighed the episode
against the backdrop of the country's consuming moral melodrama. If
President Clinton is still in office after admitting to sexual
relations in the White House with an intern, many people asked, why
should a principal weathering a protracted divorce lose her job for
having a baby with a man she intended to marry?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because you have a job doesn't mean you sell your soul to
the public,'' said Todd Kapner, an advertising salesman for The
Independent, the twice-weekly newspaper in Columbia County. ``I
think people recognize the potential for invasion of privacy. If
you're President it goes with the territory. But if you're a
principal, it's a disincentive for anyone to want a position like
that if you have to come under this intense scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Some were troubled by the incident, including Stephen Formel,
49, a retired ship's captain and father of six who is chairman of
the school board of the 1,800-student district. He and a couple of
the other nine board members, he said, felt torn. They wanted to
make it clear they understood people sin and make mistakes. But on
the other hand, he said, the board should be asking the community,
``Do we have values or don't we?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools are supposed to try to teach values, that one's action
do have consequences,'' said Formel, who said he was dismayed after
20 years in the Caribbean to return in the early 1990s to an
America whose moral landscape had been transformed.
</P>
<P>
   But the board's lawyers said laws that forbid discrimination
against unmarried or pregnant women could expose not just the board
but individual members to lawsuits if any action was taken against
Mrs. Rich. Since parents were not pressuring the board to act,
members felt no compulsion to reprimand Mrs. Rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there had been a hue and cry from people, then maybe there
would have been a different outcome,'' Formel said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the population increasingly consists of artisans,
shopkeepers, lawyers and physicians, it is farmers who give the
275-square-mile Taconic Hills area in central Columbia County its
dominant personality. Barns and silos still loom over the rolling
landscape like castles, and the smells of cow manure and cut hay
permeate the air.
</P>
<P>
   Because the area is only a two-hour drive away, many New Yorkers
own summer homes here, or have moved permanently and do business by
e-mail and fax. Their cosmopolitan outlook has influenced some
thinking, but even the most traditional residents are exposed to a
changing nationwide moral climate, conveyed by television.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the clergy say they deal increasingly with diverse
types of families _ single parents, divorced parents, unmarried
parents and gay couples _ and have adopted a pragmatic approach in
their counseling.

YOU SAY TURANDOH, I SAY TURANDOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's tough to sound as if you know what you're talking about
when the opera is ``Turandot.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because whichever way you pronounce the title, somebody's going
to think you're putting on airs. Or that you're undereducated and
colloquial. Or took too many French classes in high school. Or
haven't kept up with your reading.
</P>
<P>
   TuranDOT, with a ``T'' at the end? Or TuranDOH, with silent
final ``T''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Turandot'' is just about my all-time favorite opera. A
coldhearted princess orders the execution of a string of suitors,
then finds the meaning of true love. And it's all done to a
gloriously colorful orchestral accompaniment, with a continuous
string of grand arias, ensembles and choruses, crafted in a lush,
late-romantic harmonic idiom. It takes a decent orchestra, pretty
good staging and fabulous singers; it can be heaven on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Written in the early 1920s, ``Turandot'' is perhaps more popular
than ever. Even as Fort Worth enjoys its performance of this
relatively new (operatically speaking) masterpiece, a giant outdoor
multinational production is being staged at the Forbidden City in
Beijing, the mythical setting of the piece.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since I started keeping up with operas in the 1970s,
cognoscenti have tended to say the final ``T.'' One might
occasionally hear Turando(t) with a silent ``T'' at the end, but
one would attribute that to someone just giving a French
pronunciation to an Italian word. (Except for ``H,'' there are no
silent consonants in Italian.)
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the rules of Italian diction, all singers in the
Fort Worth production will be sounding that final ``T.'' As long as
everyone is on pitch, sings beautifully and looks good, we won't
complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great age-old controversy,'' says soprano Rebecca
Copley, who has the title role, and who admits that she has sung in
productions _ at City Opera in New York, no less _ in which
everyone dropped the ``T.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a point of interest, not a big deal,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Not a big deal? Copley doesn't have to make small talk at
intermission and risk being laughed at all the way to Houston for
saying it wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Because, even if the singers sing it with a final ``T'' _ and
we'll accept that as the current standard practice _ the latest
scholarly evidence points in the other direction.
</P>
<P>
   In summer 1997, in ``Opera Quarterly,'' Patrick Vincent Casali
of the faculty of Oakton Community College in Des Plaines, Ill.,
came forward in an article titled ``The Pronunciation of Turandot:
Puccini's Last Enigma,'' with compelling evidence that the final
``T'' in Turandot should be silent.
</P>
<P>
   Turandot, he points out, is not an Italian word. Few words in
Italian end in consonants. Standard Italian rules don't apply.
</P>
<P>
   Puccini fairly frequently set the word Turandot in the opera at
high pitch on extended notes _ making it mighty hard for a singer
to tack on a convincing final ``T.'' And Puccini, of all composers,
knew how to set words to music. If he had wanted a ``T'' sounded at
the end of Turandot, Casali says, he wouldn't have stuck it up
there at the end of a long, high ``A,'' marked ``con tutta forza.''
</P>
<P>
   Casali points out that fashionable, aristocratic Italians at the
time of the debut of ``Turandot'' affected a French accent.
</P>
<P>
   Casali also refers to major recordings through the 1950s in
which the final ``T'' is silent, including performances featuring
Mario del Monaco, Renata Tebaldi, Maria Callas, Elisabeth
Schwarzkopf and Magda Olivero.
</P>
<P>
   He recalls performances at the Chicago Lyric Opera in 1959 and
1970 in which the ``T'' was silent.
</P>
<P>
   According to Casali, the first definite, audible final ``T'' on
Turandot on a major recording came in 1959 under Erich Leinsdorf;
Casali attributes this to a Germanizing tendency on the part of
Leinsdorf.
</P>
<P>
   Soprano Rosa Raisa, who sang the title role in the premiere
production of ``Turandot'' at La Scala in 1926, was interviewed on
a Metropolitan Opera radio program in 1962. She confidently
explained to her perplexed radio host that she always pronounced
Turandot with a silent final ``T'' and that Puccini and Toscanini
(who conducted the premiere) also pronounced it that way.
</P>
<P>
   The solution?
</P>
<P>
   Play it safe and don't say it all.
</P>
<P>
   Just say, ``Wasn't the Puccini just divine at the opera last
night?''
</P>
<P>
   Just be sure you know how to pronounce ``Puccini.''

 HILLSDALE: their counseling.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rabbi Daniel Fried of Congregation Anshe Emeth in Greenport
said: ``Although you do find a lot of conservatism, you do find
pockets of liberal thought. It's pretty much live and let live.''
</P>
<P>
   No one, it seems, has wrestled more with the impact of her
actions than Mrs. Rich.
</P>
<P>
   She is a 42-year-old Ohio native trained in special education at
the College of St. Rose in Albany. She has a ruddy complexion,
auburn hair, brown eyes that lock in with her listener's even when
discussing intimate matters, and a dry wit.
</P>
<P>
   After a teaching career, in 1993 she became principal of the
Roeliff Jansen Elementary School, which had had three principals in
the previous five years. She took charge, tightening discipline and
reassigning veteran teachers.
</P>
<P>
   At the time her name was Donna Straub. She had been married for
15 years and had two children, Michaela, now 14, and Christine, 11.
But within a year after becoming principal, she and her husband
sought a divorce. By Christmas 1996, at an open house at her home
for her staff of 65, teachers noticed she was pregnant. One asked,
``Do you have some news for us?''
</P>
<P>
   Friends knew that she was seeing and intended to marry Joe Rich,
now 52, an engineer with the Federal Highway Administration in
Albany and a father of two teen-agers who was also going through a
divorce. Their families had known one another through church
activities.
</P>
<P>
   In school, the principal handled her situation forthrightly,
making no attempt to hide her relationship with Rich. While she was
in maternity clothes, she invited him to help serve food at a tea
for parent volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was rather obvious that I was ready to go any day, and it
was really obvious that he was here with me, that we were not
married yet,'' Mrs. Rich said in an interview. ``He introduced
himself as my intended to some parents, and from what we could see
it was not a concern. ``
</P>
<P>
   On June 6, 1997, her daughter Janell, a rosy-cheeked blonde, was
born. On that same day, her divorce became final. ``I had
preferred, of course, that it had happened earlier,'' she said.
``It was not to be. It was totally out of my control.'' She married
Rich this May 25, after his divorce came through.
</P>
<P>
   During the months before the birth, Mrs. Rich struggled with
what she would tell Michaela and Christine. She said she firmly
believed that her children should ``abstain from a sexual
relationship until they were married.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted them to know I did not prefer the event to happen in
this sequence,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the anonymous flier _ a ``vindictive act to me
personally,'' she said _ that created the public stir and, as she
put it, exposed ``my humanity.'' She said she wished that the
author had visited her and discussed how one might explain to a
child a principal's inconsistent behavior.
</P>
<P>
   She said: ``If you as a parent or as a role model have fallen or
failed or made a mistake or however you explain it to your child,
you don't sink, you don't stay there. You move on, you give them
the tools and resources they need to understand that you are
repentant, that you are making a blessing of this. I spent the next
six months helping my kids prepare for the arrival of a new
sister.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, said John Oates, the district's Superintendent, Mrs.
Rich's strong reputation outweighed any qualms.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who know Mrs. Rich know she is a highly principled
person,'' he said.

CUTTING THE CORD: THE CELL PHONE AS ONLY PHONE

<P>
   When Susan Kubira, an interior designer in the Chicago area,
decided to disconnect her home telephone to go completely cellular,
she faced raised eyebrows from her friends, employees and, most of
all, phone company.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just didn't believe I wanted to do it,'' she said. ``I
said I wanted to permanently disconnect, and the person I called
said, `OK, we will temporarily disconnect.' I said, `No, I want a
permanent disconnection,' and she said, `Are you sure?' And I said,
`I'm sure.' It's been eight months, and I still don't have my
deposit back.''
</P>
<P>
   Phone companies might have to get used to it. More and more
telephone customers are cutting the cord _ getting rid of their
stationary wired phones entirely _ despite the occasional bad
reception, dead batteries and broken handsets of the wireless
phones.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are partly due to developments in the hugely
competitive cellular phone landscape. Increased competition has
lowered prices, and coverage areas have improved, reducing the
number of cutoffs in mid-conversation that once characterized
wireless phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   And the new portable phones are packed with features that make
them more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   About one million customers sign up for cellular phone service
each month, and industry forecasters say the number of cellular
phones in the United States will more than double, to 113.7
million, in five years, compared with the current 53.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Not every new cellular phone replaces a land line, and cord
cutters are still relatively rare. But the trend is growing,
analysts say. Richard Siber, who follows wireless communications
for Andersen Consulting in Boston, predicts that cellular phones
will achieve ``25 to 35 percent displacement'' of wired telephones
in five to seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kubira decided to cut the cord when reviewing her phone bill
last January. ``I realized I was paying a lot of money for a phone
to do two things _ to sit on my bed table and to collect voice
mail,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her land-line bill ran about $80 a month for services that
included an unlisted number, voice mail and caller ID. She kept her
home phone on until January because the cellular phone service she
had at that time was expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old service was $295 a month, but the bill was $700 due to
extra charges,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She dropped the land line after subscribing to AT&AMP;T's One Rate
plan, which charges her $149 for 1,900 minutes of connection time
(that's nearly 32 hours) a month, without additional roaming or
long-distance fees.
</P>
<P>
   Her cellular phone also has the caller ID and voice-mail
features of a land line, as well as a 200-name speed-dialing
directory and her favorite feature, a ringer that plays 37 tunes
(her nephew likes to set hers to ``The 1812 Overture'').
</P>
<P>
   Mario Micheletti, an owner and sous-chef at the Tyler Point
Grille in Barrington, R.I., said he had decided to offer guests a
cellular phone rather than installing a pay phone because it was
cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Micheletti said he figured that it would take $70 in calls each
month to offset the cost of installing a pay phone from the phone
company in his restaurant. Buying his own pay phone _ even used _
would cost about $800, he said. ``Now I start to think, they had a
weekend option on this Sprint PCS, and my busiest time was the
weekend,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So Micheletti bought a handset for $99 after rebates, set up
cellular service with Sprint for $29.95 a month and paid an
additional $4.99 for an optional service granting unlimited calls
between 7 p.m. Friday and 7 a.m. Monday. (Sprint PCS currently
offers nights and weekends free as a promotion in some areas,
including Micheletti's.)
</P>
<P>
   Now when a customer asks to check on a baby sitter, Micheletti
hands over a cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   Micheletti said he had not considered cutting his land line at
home, but he admitted that he often talked on his cellular phone
even when one of his four or five conventional phones was in reach,
especially if he was making a toll call.
</P>
<P>
   Some calls that are long distance on conventional phones are
within his cellular phone's local calling area, which extends as
far as Boston, and are treated as local calls. One reason he keeps
his land line is he always knows where his wired phones are _ which
is not true with his wireless phones. ``With the one phone, I might
misplace it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Giovannucci, a printing broker in Los Alamitos, Calif.,
cut the cord, converting his voice phone to a data line, in early
1997. He solved the ``where's the phone?'' problem by having two
handsets with the same number. ``One stays by my bed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The other is with him at all times so he can respond immediately
to both calls from customers and problems on printing jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Giovannucci credits his new wireless accessibility for an
increase in his business' revenue, to about $2 million a year, more
than double his revenue before he went to cellular phones. He said
the move had also helped him expand his service area; he now has
clients as far away as Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do twice or three times the business than when I had a land
line,'' he said in a call from his car.
</P>
<P>
   Although he tried a pager, it didn't let him respond quickly
enough. When there was a problem with a job on the press, the
printer would stop printing and start charging a ``wait fee'' of
$500 an hour while Giovannucci looked for a phone.
</P>
<P>
   Giovannucci has armed his two salesmen with cellular phones and
racks up close to $10,000 a year in cellular-phone fees. Even
though he pays Airtouch Cellular $125 a month for 1,000 minutes,
Giovannucci said, he and his salesmen use double that and pay a
premium for going over their allotted time.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was happenstance that Barry Atwood became a cord cutter.
Atwood, a life insurance salesman for Allstate Insurance, said he
had started using a cellular phone because he circulates around six
offices in the St. Augustine, Fla., area.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are trying to locate me, I can't give them the
number to five offices,'' Atwood said. ``I don't know when I will
be there.'' When he moved into a temporary apartment, he didn't
bother to get a land line and discovered that he didn't need one.
</P>
<P>
   He had intended to get a new land line when he moved into a
permanent residence because he found the 10-cents-a-minute calling
plans attractive _ until he realized that he was already getting
that rate with his 700-minutes-for-$70 cellular phone service.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes right down to it,'' he said, ``I probably don't
need a land line _ it's a habit. A habit you have to learn to
drop.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Atwood said, he feared that being constantly
accessible through a cellular phone would prove overwhelming. ``I
thought, `Hey, I don't want to be reached all of the time,' but
it's a phantom problem,'' he said. ``If I don't want to answer, I
just don't answer. It has caller ID, so I can look at it and say
no, I don't want to talk to them.'' Unanswered calls are forwarded
to voice mail.
</P>
<P>
   Many frequent cellular phone users who intend to cut the cord
find that they can't. Jordan Summers, a territory sales manager for
WRQ Inc., a software company in Seattle, has carried a cellular
phone since 1987, when they were nearly the size of suitcases. He
recently realized that he didn't need a wired phone any more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when I am sitting somewhere with a clear land line,'' he
said, ``I just find it easier to use a cellular phone.'' But when
it came to cutting the cord at home, he balked because his
13-year-old son had taken over the land line.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular phones aren't always less expensive, but some cord
cutters, like Lindquist Machine Corp., say the advantages are worth
extra expense and sometimes inconvenience. Lindquist, an industrial
machine manufacturer in Green Bay, Wis., has replaced its central
phone system with a network of cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last November, we decided wireless was the way to go,'' said
Marsha Demuth, Lindquist's information systems and human resources
manager. The company priced PBX, or private branch exchange,
switchboard systems, three years ago, but decided that the up-front
costs, about $160,000, warranted waiting. ``We had our choice then
of all of the PBX systems, and even though they were state of the
art at the time, we heard enough to know big changes were coming.''
</P>
<P>
   So Lindquist kept the old system until last October, when it
decided to go cellular. Within weeks, all but the 15 data lines
were replaced. Sixty of the 140 employees were given cellular
phones at less than half the cost quoted for land-line systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the nice thing about not having to put in major
equipment and run lines,'' Ms. Demuth said. The company expected
phone bills to double, but they are two and a half times as high.
In July, the cost was about $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   The other 80 employees, most of whom work on the factory floor,
share the wireless phones carried by ``key personnel,'' Ms. Demuth
said, which put phones on the factory floor for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   But there were some unanticipated problems. The Ericsson
handsets, which were not designed for an industrial environment,
were often broken. Reception was poor in the metal assembly
buildings and in parts of headquarters as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some offices that are halfway into the ground,'' Ms.
Demuth said, ``so the people in them have to stand up when they
talk to make sure they don't lose the signal.''
</P>
<P>
   The company said the extra expense and problems were worth
putting up with because the cellular phones had increased the
productivity of the sales staff and engineers, and even the
visiting consulting engineers, whom Lindquist keeps extra handsets
for.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have to be hunting a phone at $100 an hour,'' Ms.
Demuth said. Clients calling in still get a receptionist who
transfers calls, so no change is apparent to callers.
</P>
<P>
   For a lot of people who switch exclusively to cellular phones,
the best part of cutting the cord is the satisfaction of saying
goodbye to a phone company. ``It felt great _ I just had them shut
it off,'' said Caroline Morton, a fund-raiser for Sen. Christopher
S. Bond, R-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Morton is still steamed about the time her home phone
malfunctioned and she had to leave work to wait hours for a repair
crew. But she restrained herself from taunting the phone company
when she cut off the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I was moving,'' she said. ``I'm not a vindictive
person.''

VOTING ON THE WEB: NOT AROUND THE CORNER, BUT ON THE HORIZON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Fla., Mo., S.C., Texas, Utah)   (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By REBECCA FAIRLEY RANEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marc Strassman first began thinking about Internet voting in
1995. Strassman, a 50-year-old entrepreneur, political activist and
occasional congressional candidate, was in the process of starting
a business, and he wanted to file a legal notice on line. He soon
discovered that an Internet posting didn't satisfy the legal
requirement, but the episode got him thinking about the role of the
Internet in democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I said, `Why aren't we voting on the Internet?''' he said.
``That seemed logical.''
</P>
<P>
   So, two summers ago, Strassman spent his days at a food store in
Los Angeles collecting signatures to place his Virtual Voting
Rights Initiative on the California ballot as a plebiscite. He
needed 400,000 signatures. He collected about 6 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of enthusiasm for Strassman's efforts that
summer, Internet voting is a subject of keen interest to policy
makers in state legislatures, election offices and even the
Pentagon. Plans are under way to start testing systems by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Defense is sponsoring a program whose success
or failure will dictate the near future of Internet voting. The
system under design would allow the six million Americans overseas,
both military and civilian, to cast ballots by using the Internet.
Five states _ Florida, Missouri, South Carolina, Texas and Utah _
will participate in the Pentagon's pilot project, which is
scheduled to take place in the 2000 general election. Under current
plans, voters will be able to use the voting system on their own
computers and on terminals provided at United States installations.
Election offices in the participating states will be given
government computers to receive the ballot transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   Lessons from the federal pilot project will help state election
officials decide whether they want to offer Internet voting to
residents at home. Thomas Wilkey, executive director of the New
York State Board of Elections, said that election officials had a
responsibility to find ways to make voting as easy as possible but
that he was taking a cautious approach to Internet voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to get up on the horse and get comfortable in the
saddle before we can take a ride,'' Wilkey said. ``I think every
state has a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   In Florida and California, election officials are moving ahead.
Paul Craft, a computer audit analyst for the Florida Division of
Elections, said Internet voting systems might be ready for testing
in Florida as soon as next year. After studying online security, he
said, he concluded that the Internet was ``a very viable
technology'' for transmitting ballots.
</P>
<P>
   ``My initial reaction was, `That's a stupid thing to do,'''
Craft said. ``I ended up becoming a leading proponent of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he talks in detail about the ease of using digital
signatures to verify voters' identities, about protecting voters
privacy by making sure no one could found out how any person voted
and about setting up multiple control points to make audits easy.
</P>
<P>
   Craft argues that the Internet could make elections cheaper.
Electronic voting machines cost $5,000 to $7,000 apiece. With
electronic ballots created for Internet use, the cost of each
machine needed to retrieve the ballots would be about $600.
</P>
<P>
   While Florida officials are pursuing the issue through their
election office, California's secretary of state, Bill Jones, is
setting up a panel to study the issue. He said that when the panel
completed its report, perhaps next year, he would send the
Legislature the findings. In 1997, the Legislature passed a bill to
finance a study of online voter registration and voting, as well as
the use of digital signatures on the Internet for signing petitions
for ballot initiatives, but Gov. Pete Wilson vetoed the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the promise of lower costs and increased access,
Internet voting raises many questions as well, particularly about
security. Polli Brunelli, director of the federal Voting Assistance
Program, said the transmission of votes through the military's
pilot program would be protected by an encryption system created at
the Department of Defense. Also, the system that is being developed
must provide a way for an individual to log in with a unique
identity and password, but, to protect the right to a secret
ballot, it must make it impossible to match an individual with the
vote cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``At no time during that process would we be able to see how any
person voted,'' Ms. Brunelli said.
</P>
<P>
   In his veto message, Wilson cited concern about security as the
reason for vetoing the Internet voting bill. ``The use of such a
system will compromise voter confidentiality and generate
significant opportunities for fraud,'' he wrote. ``Although current
encryption technology is making advances in providing a more secure
environment to prevent tampering by third parties, no one can yet
guarantee a completely safe, tamper-proof system. Without such a
guarantee, a study is premature.''
</P>
<P>
   The vetoed bill resembles in some respects the Virtual Voting
Rights Initiative that Strassman circulated in Los Angeles in 1996.
``I was flattered that the Republicans were concerned enough to try
to kill the bill,'' he said. On the issue of Internet voting,
Strassman has found that he is not so far ahead of his time as he
has been: in 1980, he ran for Congress in Silicon Valley with a
slogan of ``Compute, don't commute.'' He lost.
</P>
<P>
   He has also learned some of the hard math of California
politics. After hours of collecting signatures, Strassman found
that the backers of initiatives often spent $1 million to collect
enough signatures to get a measure on the state ballot. So he
decided to put the Internet to the test by placing a copy of the
voting initiative on the Web for people to sign.
</P>
<P>
   The results were not encouraging. In the course of several
months, only one person, a Berkeley resident, found it, printed it
out, signed it and mailed it.

NET'S NOT ENOUGH: STARR-REPORT BOOKS OUT, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Wash., Calif., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By KATIE HAFNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By midafternoon last Friday, modems and and laser printers were
laboring mightily, dishing out the report by the Whitewater
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, as quickly as the Web-using
public could devour it.
</P>
<P>
   Some six million people read the report in cubicles, home
offices and living rooms around the world, according to Relevant
Knowledge Inc., a Web-usage tracking service. They saved it on to
disks and loaded it into their Palm Pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The following morning, several newspapers around the nation
carried the entire text of the report detailing President Clinton's
relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Who, then, would want to buy one of the insta-books that have
just arrived at booksellers?
</P>
<P>
   The three publishers who rushed their paperback editions of the
report to bookstores seem to think that a lot of people would.
``Even if you were to download it and print it out, would you
rather have 400 loose sheets or stick it in your pocket?'' said
Gene Taft, a spokesman for Public Affairs, a new publishing house.
``A book is just a lot more convenient.''
</P>
<P>
   Public Affairs printed 300,000 copies in 72 hours and began
shipping the books on Monday. Its edition, priced at $10, includes
45 pages of commentary from Washington Post writers, and the White
House's initial rebuttal.
</P>
<P>
   Pocket Books, a division of Simon &AMP; Schuster, printed and
shipped 650,000 books, priced at $5.99, and went back to press
Wednesday for another 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The third publisher, Prima Publishing, based in Rocklin, Calif.,
printed 150,000. Pocket Books and Prima had books ready to ship by
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly enough, the online booksellers appear to be
fostering some of the biggest early success of ``The Starr
Report,'' as all three publishers have titled it.
</P>
<P>
   The books soared to the top of the bestseller lists at both
Barnesandnoble.com and Amazon.com last Friday afternoon through
pre-orders alone and have remained there, to the surprise of some
executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hypothesis was that it would be No. 1 for about an hour,''
said David Risher, Amazon's senior vice president for marketing and
product development. ``Everyone would read it in The New York Times
and then it would fall from there, because it was free on the Net.
But it's stayed at the top.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Jeff Bezos, chief executive of Amazon, directed his
editorial staff to post a notice on the company's Web site, telling
shoppers that the report was free on the Web, lest they think that
Amazon was pulling a fast one. Still, sales continued to climb.
</P>
<P>
   There have been previous books published from political
documents like Oliver North's testimony in the Iran-Contra affair
and House Speaker Newt Gingrich's ``Contract with America.''
</P>
<P>
   But chances are that buyers of one of the instant Starr report
books will already have read most or all of the report on the Net,
or in a newspaper or magazine. Buying it in book form, then, is
``almost a commemorative impulse,'' said Paul Elie, an editor at
Farrar, Straus &AMP;Giroux, a New York publishing house. ``Once you've
read the report on the Net or in a newspaper, seen the TV coverage,
and seen Ted Koppel talk about it, what else could it be?''
</P>
<P>
   Liz Hartman, vice president and director of publicity for Pocket
Books, believes the Internet actually stimulated interest among
book buyers rather than dampening it. ``There's just overwhelming
interest in this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bezos said he bought the Public Affairs edition for himself,
even after reading the report on the Net and printing much of it
out last Friday. ``Even though I had printed it, I sort of wanted
the thing in book form,'' he said. ``It's easier to keep around.''
Moreover, he noted, the Net-produced versions have their own hidden
costs. ``Add up the toner and printer paper and it ends up costing
about 5 cents a page to print it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Simonson, a book buyer at Elliott Bay Book Co. in Seattle,
said his store ordered the book in modest quantities. ``It's almost
more a form of magazine publishing, or newspaper publishing, albeit
with a different binding,'' he said. He said he doubted the book
would remain a bestseller for long.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Warne, a music store owner in Cotati, Calif., said he had
no plans to buy the book. ``I think I've read enough,'' he said.
If, however, Ms. Lewinsky wrote her own book, he'd be interested.
``I'd love to see what Monica has to say in a tell-all book. That
would be absolutely fascinating. It wouldn't be just what she said
under oath. And it wouldn't be in the legalese that the Starr
report is in.''

GIVE A NEW GENERATION THE GIFT OF LIVE MUSIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barring an unforeseen accident, by the time you read this,
Shania Twain will have played Dallas' Reunion Arena, having blown
through town on her first national tour _ which comes only after
she has sold more than 10 million CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Let's roll that one around on the tongue again: her first solo
tour _ AFTER she has sold more than 10 million CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Twain, Mariah Carey, the Spice Girls and others long ago
realized and capitalized on something unthinkable even 15 years
ago: Live performances are not essential to selling boatloads of
CDs.
</P>
<P>
   MTV, the Internet, pay-per-view specials and getting songs on
soundtracks will move a product without the artist having to live
out of a suitcase for months on end.
</P>
<P>
   And being able to cut it live just doesn't matter as much as it
once did.
</P>
<P>
   Now you can't blame performers for not wanting to tour till they
drop, as everyone from Elvis to the Stones to James Brown did. If
the money's there to be made without all that aggravation, why
shouldn't they take it?
</P>
<P>
   Fine. We won't even discuss what this means for a band's
abilities to produce music, or mention those that deliver weak
performances while charging absurdly high ticket prices. That's for
another day.
</P>
<P>
   But what should be noted is that young people need help
appreciating live music. If you go to a lot of shows, you can see
what I mean.
</P>
<P>
   You'll see supposedly broad-minded people booing an opening act
after one song, as Beastie Boys fans did to Asian Dub Foundation
last week.
</P>
<P>
   You'll see people hitting the beer line when the artist they've
paid $30, $40 or more to see plays a tune they haven't already
heard a million times.
</P>
<P>
   You'll see people chatting when a favorite performer is doing a
quiet song.
</P>
<P>
   There's something wrong here. People who haven't grown up with
live performances can't be blamed. They've been raised with the
ability to walk into and out of a room while a video was playing,
the ability to rent a video of a performance and turn it on and off
at will.
</P>
<P>
   They've never learned to appreciate the subtleties of live
performances, or to listen to an artist even when they're not doing
The Big Hit. Or to kick back and listen to someone they're not
familiar with.
</P>
<P>
   And this is where you come in, you being someone who grew up
going to a lot of shows, and who now has a child or two.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to take that child to a show and teach him or her how
to enjoy and appreciate the experience of live music.
</P>
<P>
   Which means, to get there on time. To listen _ not only to the
songs they know, but to the songs they don't know. To watch for the
differences between what they heard on CD and what they might be
hearing onstage. To get their T-shirt before or after the show, not
during it. To make an honest effort to appreciate a band they
haven't heard before.
</P>
<P>
   It might also be a good idea to take that child to a club or
small hall show. This will reinforce the idea that performers
aren't worth seeing only after they're big enough to play Starplex;
it can show a child just how rewarding a performance at an intimate
venue can be.
</P>
<P>
   And it might help children appreciate types of music that don't
often make it to enormous venues, such as jazz, which would
introduce a whole new world of amazing performers.
</P>
<P>
   And this, in turn, might underscore an appreciation for
discovering music on one's own and actually becoming a lifelong
fan, staying with an artist from one CD to the next and not just
listening to one hit from one CD before going on to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the benefits you'd be giving your child, the lessons
you could teach him or her while the two of you are doing something
you both enjoy. It's worth a little extra effort _ and the level of
music appreciation you'll be giving your child will last a
lifetime.

<P>
   For many theater lovers, personal participation in show business
reaches its pinnacle in a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta. Once
bitten, one is most likely forever entranced by the Victorian wit,
period costumes and certainty that the cast will be happily paired
off by the final curtain.
</P>
<P>
   The Web is perhaps more suited to devotees of the collaborations
of William S. Gilbert (1836-1911), the dramatist, and Sir Arthur S.
Sullivan (1842-1900), the composer, than to any other group of
Victorian fanatics, with the possible exception of the Baker Street
Irregulars. And Holmes and Watson don't sing and dance, or
shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive
( &UR; diamond.idbsu.edu/GaS/GaS.html &LR; ) bills itself as ``the premier
Internet light opera site.'' It includes access to what it calls
the first Web operas: the complete lyrics, dialogue and music of
three of the most popular operettas _ ``Pinafore,'' ``The Mikado''
and ``The Pirates of Penzance'' _ and three others. They are on
MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface), and can be heard on
PC's with a MIDI-capable sound card. There are librettos and a
discography for all 14 Gilbert and Sullivan operettas, as well as
information about the works of Gilbert without Sullivan and vice
versa.
</P>
<P>
   For performers and audiences, there are links to G &AMP; S
performing group Web sites, an international calendar of events and
a list of Gilbert and Sullivan societies, as well as librettos and
extensive information about staging.
</P>
<P>
   Savoynet  &UR; (www.cris.com/oakapple/savoynet) &LR; , the Internet
Gilbert and Sullivan discussion group linked to the archive,
forwards its subscribers 50 to 100 messages a dayabout the
partners, their works and related matters of musical theater and
British culture. Its ``Opera of the Week'' discussions amount to an
in-depth study of each work, a resource for amateur theatricals.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the archive, historians will discover short and
long biographies of both men and many of their associates,
bibliographies and ``An Illustrated Interview With Sir Arthur
Sullivan,'' from The Strand magazine in 1897, a detailed account of
the composer's mind at work.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a history of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company and
capsule biographies of famous Savoyards. (The name comes from the
Savoy Theater in London, where Richard D'Oyly Carte produced the
original G &AMP; S operettas.)
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive is based in _
Boise, Idaho?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a neat example of the global village,'' Alex Feldman, an
associate professor in the mathematics and computer science
department at Boise State University, wrote by e-mail. Feldman, who
put the archive on the Internet five years ago this month, added,
``One fellow wrote that he was going to give us a `Best of Britain'
award, until he noticed we weren't in Britain.''
</P>
<P>
   The entire nonprofit site is assembled by volunteers the world
over, and is maintained on a Boise State Web server.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gilbert and Sullivan totally transformed the English operetta
scene,'' Jim Farron of Springfield, Va., the archive curator, wrote
by e-mail. ``They introduced clean entertainment for the entire
family, and for the first time the librettist was an equal to the
composer; Gilbert strongly insisted on this.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the G &AMP; S world has a holy grail _ the score for
`Thespis,' the first G &AMP; S work. I don't know if any copies still
exist, or if they will ever be found, but the possibility certainly
gives G &AMP; S enthusiasts something to talk about and look forward
to.''
</P>
<P>
   The archive currently has over 40 librettos and 200 MIDI files,
said Farron, whose day job is being the Webmaster for the U.S.
Office of Personnel Management. The G &AMP; S archive gets 3,000 to
4,000 visitors a week, and the section that draws the most
comments, he said, is the Web operas, particularly ``The Pirates of
Penzance.'' He is especially proud of the archive's many
lesser-known works connected with Gilbert, Sullivan or the Savoy
Theater other than the 14 operettas.
</P>
<P>
   The archive will add a special treat in a few weeks. ``This will
be the first operetta score written specifically for the
Internet,'' Farron said. ``This score, which is now pretty well
complete, is being written to accompany one of the Savoy companion
pieces for which the music has been lost. We think that there may
well be considerable interest in this work, especially for
performance in the schools, as the requirements for putting it on
will be pretty simple.''
</P>
<P>
   No Gilbert and Sullivan archive would be complete without
parodies. One, ``I am the very model of a heroine barbarian,'' is
sung by Xena, letter-perfect with the original's beat and rhyme, on
the linked parody archive  &UR; (www.cs.cmu.edu/valkyrie/parody) &LR; . ``The
Ruddigore Hillbillies,'' in eight verses, is another; another is
called ``I Am the Very Model of an Oldbie on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though much of the humor was topical, it was based on
universal themes that are just as valid today as they were then,''
Farron said. ``The music is beautiful, the jokes funny and
original, and these operas are loads of fun to both perform in and
watch. I am convinced that the G &AMP; S operas are timeless, and will
still be played a hundred years from now and a thousand years from
now.''

WOULD YOU PAY A PRICE FOR MOBILITY?

<P>
   ``If you are looking to use a cellular phone as a land-line
replacement, you have to look at what kinds of calls you make,''
said Ian Guillet, an analyst for the telecommunications group at
International Data Corp. in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can save a ton of money,'' said Guillet, who no longer has
a land line for voice calls, ``or it can cost you a ton of money.''
</P>
<P>
   How do you know if you will save or lose? Potential cord-cutters
prize mobility first of all _ they aren't constantly near a land
line but they want to be available for calls. They also tend to
make a lot of long-distance calls.
</P>
<P>
   Because cellular phone users commonly pay the same rate per
minute for local calls and for long distance, local calls are less
expensive on a land line. You get the best discount by buying
minutes in advance, but if you don't use all your minutes, the
average price for each call is higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use all of my minutes, and I use them long distance,''
Guillet said.
</P>
<P>
   The flat-rate plans are attractive, but people with very
specialized calling patterns may find a package better tailored to
their specific needs.
</P>
<P>
   Read the fine print in the advertisements and on the contracts,
and shop around. It may even pay to ask your carrier to match a
lower rate from another carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Prospective switchers should also think about how secure they
need their phone conversations to be. While cellular companies say
digital phones offer excellent security, analog services are more
vulnerable to electronic eavesdroppers than land lines.
</P>
<P>
   People who pay for optional land-line features like caller ID
and voice mail and who carry a pager can save with a digital
cellular phone that includes those features, often at no extra
charge.
</P>
<P>
   If scratchy sound or sudden cutoffs bother you, keep your land
line. ``I think on balance, you find the land line exponentially
more reliable,'' said Samuel Simon, chairman of the
Telecommunications Research and Action Center in Washington, a
consumer watchdog group that tracks the cost of phone service.
</P>
<P>
   The sound quality of cellular phones can be poor, you cannot
make calls from a basement, and calls are frequently cut off, Simon
said. Cellular phones are also generally a poor choice for an
Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   If you are considering cutting the cord, look over your old
phone bills for calling patterns. Where do you call most? How many
minutes a month are you on the phone? Then comb carefully through
the huge array of service packages for the one that suits your use.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to ask about hidden charges. Activation fees of $20 to
$50 to turn on your phone are common, though sometimes waived, but
beware of termination fees. You can be charged up to $175 to
deactivate your phone.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies also charge an additional fee, like 10 cents per
call or 2 cents per minute, to link your call to a land-line phone.
Roaming charges vary by company, with some charging $5 for each day
you use the phone outside your calling area and up to $1.99 a call.
</P>
<P>
   Some charge no roaming fees at all. Find out if there is an
extra charge for features like voice mail and caller ID, and do not
get talked into phone insurance if you don't really think you need
it.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In commuter heaven, all traffic lights would
magically switch to green for approaching drivers, forming strings
of fiery green balls that go on for miles. Pedestrians in paradise
would encounter ``Walk'' signs permanently aglow, and drivers wait
patiently as the walkers dawdle the day away crossing the street.
</P>
<P>
   In real life though, drivers inevitably hit red. And in New York
City, when they must stop is usually controlled by the intricate
computer network governing many of the city's lights, a system
based in a single building in Queens, at the Traffic Management
Center of the city's Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   How does an engineer at the traffic center tell a string of
traffic lights miles away what color lights to flash, and for how
long? The traffic center's computer connects to Manhattan traffic
lights by directing data through large coaxial cables to signal
controller boxes located at intersections (the other boroughs are
connected via phone lines).
</P>
<P>
   Of the 45,000 intersections in the five boroughs, 10,800 are
directed by traffic signals. The center's computers control 6,000
of the intersections via the signal controllers; each of the signal
controllers is wired to all the traffic lights at that
intersection. The other 4,800 traffic lights run on timers with
preset patterns. If people reports a problem with one of these
non-networked signals, a traffic center engineer will go out and
adjust it manually.
</P>
<P>
   The city is divided into 15 clusters, or neighborhoods; each has
its own computer and has 640 to 720 intersections. In Manhattan,
there are separate clusters for the East Side, the West Side,
uptown, midtown and downtown. Fifteen area computers at the traffic
center send information to each individual cluster of
intersections, and these computers are in turn networked to a
supervisory computer, which monitors the entire system and
coordinates traffic patterns between them.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning, traffic center engineers sit in front of computer
terminals and train their eyes on a wall of monitors that display
surveillance gathered by 55 closed-circuit cameras located at major
traffic arteries. The buzz of a radio stream coming in from police
officers on traffic patrols is interrupted several times an hour by
the shrill ring of a telephone as one of the several hundred
officers or a traffic center official calls in to report a problem
in the field. Using that information, the traffic center can
respond to different situations and adjust the light patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic lights run on timed cycles that last 60, 90 or 120
seconds. In general, green lights stay on longer for traffic on the
avenues in Manhattan and on major roadways in all of the boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   Under ordinary traffic conditions, the area computers
controlling each cluster of intersections signal a chain of lights
to turn green in 10-second progressions. That gives each light
you're driving toward time to turn green if you are driving about
30 miles an hour (which, wouldn't you know, is the New York City
speed limit). Under that pattern, you should be able to hit a
lengthy series of green lights on major arteries before having to
stop.
</P>
<P>
   The traffic center uses the same principle _ but with red lights
_ on major arteries to divert traffic away from problem areas.
``When the scaffolding at Times Square fell this summer, our goal
was to make it inconvenient for people to get there,'' said Jack
Larson, deputy commissioner for operations at the Department of
Transportation. ``So we created a red-light pattern up Fifth Avenue
and down Broadway, making it preferable to travel on alternate
routes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the daunting attempt to smooth conditions in midtown during
the day, the traffic center also creates patterns that favor
avenues located away from the hub, like Second and Eighth Avenues.
</P>
<P>
   City traffic would be much worse if the traffic center did not
intervene, Larson said. ``When a major north-south artery in the
city is blocked, and the timing isn't modified, the backup just
gets longer and longer,'' he said. By holding more traffic back
with red lights at a significant distance from an incident, the
traffic center gives drivers enough time to go down a side street
before getting stuck at the site of the incident. The city's
traffic managers try to head off such snarls. ``That,'' Larson
said, ``would not be pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   The traffic center engineers also create patterns via computer
to favor traffic on the roads leading into Manhattan during the
morning rush period and out of the borough in the evening rush.
</P>
<P>
   From 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. on the Queensboro Bridge, for example,
lights give longer green lights for through traffic and shorter
greens for side streets, which helps the inbound Manhattan traffic
move more quickly. At 10 a.m., the pattern shifts to a midday
progression that gives equal amounts of green-light time to the
main thoroughfare and the side streets. The programmed pattern
shifts automatically again at 3 p.m. to favor the main roadway so
traffic can move outbound from Manhattan more smoothly. At 7 p.m.,
the pattern evens out for the rest of the night.
</P>
<P>
   For pedestrians, the traffic center configures the signals based
on an average stride of four feet per second (slow walkers take
notice), and it programs each light to flash ``Don't Walk'' for a
minimum of seven seconds. Although it is a rare person who is not
tempted to break into a mad dash at the sight of this warning, any
Department of Transportation official will remind you that flashing
``Don't Walk'' signals are designed to give you ample time to
finish crossing the street _ if you started when the sign said
``Walk.''
</P>
<P>
   While the average speed is assumed to be four feet per second,
traffic center engineers can also program the light patterns to
adapt to different neighborhoods. In areas with lots of elderly
people or schoolchildren, for example, the traffic center lengthens
the flashing ``Don't Walk'' signal to fit an average speed of three
feet per second.
</P>
<P>
   Other patterns have been designed to accommodate things like
presidential visits, parades, water main breaks and road
construction. ``Every year, we learn from experience and create new
patterns to smooth out the problems,'' Larson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success of the city's economy has increased the flow of
goods and services coming into it,'' he added. ``Computerizing the
signals lets us react instantaneously to emergencies so they leave
minimum impact on the commuters.''

GASP! YOU, TOO, CAN ACT OUT THE ROLE OF A PRO WRESTLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Professional wrestling is real _ if you play the video game
version.
</P>
<P>
   Because unlike the pay-per-view broadcast, what two kids do in
the World Wrestling Federation's video game, WWF Warzone, is
completely up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   On a Playstation or Nintendo console, there are no scripts.
There are no storyboards or predetermined victors _ just a nest of
fingers and thumbs grappling for chest-thumping video game victory.
</P>
<P>
   It is, in many ways, more real than what happens in the physical
ring, where all the fights are virtual and rehearsed. (The WWF came
out of the closet as a stage act long ago, but no one seems to
mind; pro wrestling is more profitable than ever).
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, all of the WWF's theatrical trappings are replicated
in the video game arena. Same theme music. Same color commentary,
costumes and fireworks. Same uproar when disgruntled losers storm
into the ring for an impromptu grudge match. All the boasts and
taunts and paroxyms of simulated agony are preserved intact.
</P>
<P>
   In Warzone's Cage Mode, opponents are trapped in a chain-link
enclosure with no pins, submissions or disqualifications. The first
person to climb out of the cage and hit the floor on the other side
wins.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, that entails slamming one's opponent against
the fence, dragging him down off the walls and putting a foot
through his face when he tries to do the same. Launching oneself
off the top of the cage onto his stunned, supine, pain-stricken
body of is also an option.
</P>
<P>
   If you prefer something more extreme, there's a Weapons Match in
which everything from metal chairs and 2-by-4s to a large
television is strewn across the ring _ the fight is over when there
is nothing left to smash.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the standard taunts and tag lines are used throughout
for extra fun and bonus points. Sure, it's great to pin down your
opponents in the guise of a 6 foot 10 inch, 328-pound guy named the
Undertaker.
</P>
<P>
   But being able to say, ``I will feast on your corpse!'' just
beforehand adds that special WWF frisson to the experience.
</P>
<P>
   Last but not least, there's Create-a-Wrestler Mode, where you
can assemble your own gladiator from an endless menu of heads,
torsos, lower bodies, skin tones, skin types (plain, hairy, ripped)
and builds, ranging from bantam to super-heavyweight.
</P>
<P>
   To say nothing of the clothing options, which include leather
shorts, chaps, dog collars, tiger-print cowboy boots, peekaboo
tuxedo jackets, eye patches and mustaches, lest one forget that
despite its Joe Six-Pack bravado, pro wrestling has no lack of
sartorial flair. In the mix-and-match department, WWF Warzone puts
Barbie Fashion Designer to shame. And for sheer camp value, there
is no contest.
</P>
<P>
   Once the wardrobe issues are resolved, there's a choice of
signature moves, personalities and musical themes. Balance your
attributes (strength, speed, toughness, recovery and charisma),
designate an alias, and your character is ready for the ring.
</P>
<P>
   It's like designing any video game character _ shrink-wrap
surface textures onto an animated 3-D model, give it a name and
reputation, and voila, another virtual fighter. That's what Iguana,
WWF Warzone's developer, did with brand-name wrestlers: it mapped
their head shots and body scans onto generic 3-D mannequins, cut in
some dialogue and pasted their profiles into Biography Mode.
</P>
<P>
   But that's essentially what the WWF does. It takes obscure
athletes, gives them new names and personas, choreographs their
moves, scripts them into fictional webs of betrayal and revenge,
and turns on the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The WWF uses Create-a-Wrestler Mode, too, but its fabrications
end up on Monday night cable, and their digital likenesses are used
to sell millions of dollars' worth of licensed merchandise on the
World Wide Web  &UR; (www.wwf.com) &LR; . With its hypermasculine physiques,
comic book costumes and flamboyant finishing moves, Wrestlemania is
as close as the physical world gets to Mortal Kombat.
</P>
<P>
   On a video game console, players use WWF characters as avatars.
But then, so do the wrestlers, who sometimes play multiple
characters in the physical arena.
</P>
<P>
   In the athletic soap opera that is the WWF, the roles of Dude
Love, Cactus Jack and Mankind, for instance, are played by one
person, whose body also plays a triple role in the video game.
Switching characters is as easy as changing your tights _ or
wrapping a new texture map onto the 3-D model. The players don't
miss a beat. And neither does the audience.
</P>
<P>
   And in both arenas, the audience plays a crucial role. This is
professional wrestling after all. It's about performance, whether
it's real combat on a virtual stage or virtual combat on a real
stage in Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of Wrestlemania, the audience can make or break a
character. In the video game, the crowd is a strategy component. If
the digital fans like your moves, they start cheering, and that
gives your wrestler a burst of energy.
</P>
<P>
   If you taunt an opponent, it makes the crowd happy, and you get
bonus points. If your charisma rating is high, the crowd is quicker
to cheer, and if it's low, they are quicker to boo, which saps your
fighting strength.
</P>
<P>
   So you end up playing to the virtual gallery, just like a real
live wrestler. Video game or no video game, real or staged, ratings
are ratings. &QL;

   Q. When I try to look at a video clip with my Web browser, I get
a message saying I need a particular plug-in. What is this, and
what should I do?
</P>
<P>
   A. Plug-ins are small programs that you can download and install
on your computer. They work within your browser, helping it handle
certain types of audio, video and document files you might find on
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   After your browser has a plug-in installed, it can display any
file requiring that plug-in. Because plug-ins work within a
browser, they differ from helper applications, which are external
programs that can be configured to activate whenever the browser
needs some help with a particular kind of Web file.
</P>
<P>
   When you get a message telling you that you need a certain
program, examine all the options in the dialogue box carefully. It
will often offer to take you to the appropriate Web page to get the
plug-in. Read the information on the page carefully and make sure
that you have enough RAM and system resources to handle the
software. Some plug-ins require that you allocate more memory to
your browser.
</P>
<P>
   If you decide to download the plug-in, follow the instructions
for installing it on your computer. Next time you open your browser
and return to the page where you encountered the alert, the
multimedia or document file should open right in your browser
window.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most most-used plug-ins include Acrobat Reader from
Adobe, which lets you view, download and print documents, and
Shockwave from Macromedia for interactive multimedia files.

A HOME-GROWN GARNISH FOR A DROP-DEAD PARTY

<P>
   Don't take any happy-homemaker tips from the film ``One True
Thing,'' which opens Friday _ unless you want to poison your
guests.
</P>
<P>
   Renee Zellweger plays Ellen Gulden, a driven young journalist
shamed into leaving her job on a big New York magazine to go home
to a sleepy college town to take care of Mother, who is dying of
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Mom is played by Meryl Streep as a sort of plump Martha Stewart,
only motherly. She does things like wallpaper the house herself and
decorate Christmas trees on the town green with the Minnies, a club
of longtime do-gooders who no doubt can also make their perennial
gardens change color with the seasons.
</P>
<P>
   It is therefore rather strange when Ellen, who is no good at any
of these things (she sets fire to the kitchen trying to prepare
chicken paillard for the ladies' luncheon), bears a lopsided cake
decorated with foxglove blossoms into the dining room _ and is not
stopped dead in her tracks by one of the Minnies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, my dear,'' the garden club president might say
(gently, of course, because Ellen has been trying so hard). ``The
cake looks lovely! Only next time, try using nasturtiums. These are
a wee bit poisonous.''
</P>
<P>
   But no, they make her an honorary Minnie _ her personal
nightmare, of course. And cut to the next scene, with nary a peep
about the cake.
</P>
<P>
   This leaves gardeners in the audience wondering, Did they eat
it? Isn't it a little premature to be playing Dr. Kevorkian? Does
Ellen resent leaving her job more than we thought? Not to mention
all those Minnies, now possibly clutching their throats, who should
know better.
</P>
<P>
   Common foxglove is Digitalis purpurea, known to stop a heart as
well as start one. The leaves, steeped in water as a tea, can kill
people (as was the case with an elderly couple in Washington state
who thought they were brewing comfrey). The velvety, fingerlike
freckled blossoms are less toxic but definitely out as edible
flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole plant is poisonous,'' the American Medical
Association's Handbook of Poisonous and Injurious Plants says.
</P>
<P>
   If this is just another example of this young career woman's
ignorance of the home arts, why doesn't one of those Minnies shout,
``Stop!''
</P>
<P>
   I called Universal Studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it was supposed to be yet another Ellen screw-up, and
originally that scene ran a little longer,'' said Cathy Mortenson,
the director of publicity. ``A couple of ladies start to eat the
cake, when Mrs. Best, one of the Minnies, screams, `Ellen, this is
poisonous!' But it took too long to get to the punch line, so the
director cut the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   The director just cut the scene? I pictured all those would-be
Martha Stewarts running out to the garden to pick foxglove for
their cakes. This bothers me. It's like those steamy movies where
the sex is never safe.
</P>
<P>
   The director, Carl Franklin, got on the phone. He sounded
irritated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, most people don't know what foxglove is, and for those
who do, it's just an ominous kind of screw-up,'' Franklin said.
``Otherwise, we wouldn't have gone to the trouble of getting a
close-up on the cake.''
</P>
<P>
   Right. I was riveted. Exquisite, velvety, mottled blossoms,
sitting on the chocolate icing, innocently waiting to strike.

THE MUFFLER MAN: AN EXHAUSTIVE CRITIQUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What is it about the muffler that inspires so many mechanics who
do not consider themselves artists to create figures of men from
the bits and pieces of an automotive exhaust system?
</P>
<P>
   Do mufflers have some sort of Jungian archetypal significance?
Is there something about their cylindrical (and let's not forget
what Cezanne might have to say about that) form that exerts a
primordial attraction, that subconsciously suggests ``human'' and
``torso''? Perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely another force is at work here, one that only
recently could be said to have entered the collective unconscious.
That would be modernism.
</P>
<P>
   Modernism and the muffler were invented about the same time.
Indeed, modernism as a means of perceiving reality was developed
largely as a response to the mechanical world, of which mufflers
are part.
</P>
<P>
   But a muffler could not be perceived as something more than a
muffler qua muffler if it weren't for modernism. Modernism and its
breaking down of artistic hierarchies _ its blurring of
distinctions between art materials and ordinary materials _ allows
everyone to see the sculptural potential of a muffler, not to
mention a few sections of tailpipe.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean that a muffler man is art? The short answer would
be _ maybe. An easier question to answer would be: Is a muffler man
a creative response to the workaday environment?
</P>
<P>
   Yes. Yes, it is. Yes.

INSTANT GRATIFICATION FOR THE IMPULSE GAMBLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KARRIE JACOBS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One night, while buying a quart of milk at a convenience store
deep in the Catskills, I found myself standing in front of a glass
display case holding perhaps 20 neat stacks of instant lottery
tickets. Maybe it was the mountain air, or maybe it was the
magnitude of the display, but suddenly I found these
butterfly-bright slips of cardboard exotic and intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, there were more of them than I'd seen in one
place before; for another, they conformed to no known esthetic
standard. Many of them displayed a brand of ugliness common to
gambling culture, green or gold graphics shouting about money, but
others were as vivid and weird as rave invitations.
</P>
<P>
   What I saw that night, as it turns out, was practically a study
in what had transpired in the lottery industry during the 1990s.
States used to issue a few instant lottery tickets a year. Then, as
they discovered the appeal of these impulse items, and the fact
that new designs sold better than those only a few weeks old, they
began issuing more and more. Each year, New York now puts out 24
instant lottery tickets, known as Scratchers. New Jersey issues
about 50. And Indiana, the most prolific state, cranks out 60.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instant tickets are basically for instant gratification,''
said Harry Murchin, the director of product development for the
Hoosier Lottery. These are games for people who simply cannot wait
for the weekly lotto drawing.
</P>
<P>
   Murchin said that a conceptual breakthrough happened in the
mid-1980s when state lotteries realized that they didn't need to
offer million-dollar prizes to sell tickets. It turns out that if
the odds of winning are good enough _ in instant games they're
generally 1 in 4 _ people will shell out a dollar to try for $2,500
or $10. Even if players win back just the dollar they spent, the
experience, Murchin said, assures participants ``that they are, in
fact, a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   At Scientific Games Holdings Corp. in Alpharetta, Ga., the
company that designs and prints instant tickets for 29 of 38 United
States lotteries (1,000 different games and 10 billion tickets a
year), Jim Nulph, the director of research and product development,
works with very basic design guidelines: ``Make it bright. Make the
design somewhat simple.'' What this means, he added, is that you
don't want a ticket's layout to ``pose a barrier to someone trying
the game.'' His motto: ``We create our play style so they're good
to the last scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   In the world of instant lottery tickets, there are recurrent
themes: playing cards, gambling, board games, sports and holidays.
There's also a category that the industry calls ``whimsical.'' The
Washington state lottery, for example, has a game called 2,000
Clams featuring cute cartoon bivalves. The closest New York gets to
whimsy is a card with a picture of the strange man from the lottery
commercials. The game is called ``Hey, You Never Know.''
</P>
<P>
   Many states have special-occasion lottery tickets for birthdays,
Mother's Day and Christmas. ``Something I'd like to take credit
for,'' said Foster Krupa, the marketing manager for the New Jersey
lottery, ``is a game called Matrimony.'' Die-cut in the shape of
bells, the lottery ticket became popular as a wedding-party favor.
</P>
<P>
   As much as the lottery industry tries to link tickets to
something other than the allure of money and the culture of gaming,
the players know better. According to the annual survey of instant
games conducted by La Fleur's Lottery World, a monthly newsletter,
tickets that trade on one of the purest concepts in gambling, the
lucky number, are always top sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Laverty, director of marketing and sales for the New York
Lottery, said that Lucky 7 is a perennial best seller, to the tune
of 1.7 million tickets a week for eight years running.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking Scratcher has the number 333 in screaming
yellow on a purple background. ``Some of our customers enjoy
numbers and have a sense of ownership about numbers,'' Ms. Laverty
replied when I questioned her about the design of the 333 game.
``They feel close to their numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   To be honest, I find the culture of lottery tickets puzzling.
And I don't really get their jingle-jangle esthetic. At least I
didn't get it until Murchin said something that explained the
allure of the display in the Catskills convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   Murchin compared the medley of instant tickets to a candy
counter. ``Folks like variety,'' he said. ``How many kinds of candy
are there with exactly the same chocolate and nougat but with
different names and wrappers?''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I got it. That's exactly what instant lottery tickets
are. They're candy bars for adults.

 FILM-SET MAGIC: CHILDHOOD REVISITED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KAYLIE JONES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ Electric cables, television monitors,
lighting and sound paraphernalia crowded the front hallway of the
two-story saltbox house. Gingerly stepping over the wires, I
crossed the foyer _ and the family home of my imagination came
alive.
</P>
<P>
   I spotted the dining room through an archway: a faux-Tiffany
lamp hung above an antique table of dark luminous wood, surrounded
by six red-velvet Louis XIII chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Made to order in Paris by James Ivory and Ismail Merchant for
their film ``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries,'' these were
replicas of the originals I grew up with. Real ones would have been
too expensive to buy and then ship all the way to the United
States, as my parents had done in real life.
</P>
<P>
   My father, the writer James Jones, had bought the table and
chairs at the Village Suisse, an antique center in Paris, a few
months before my birth, for the Ile St.-Louis apartment he had just
purchased. He was decorating it himself, since my mother, Gloria,
was bedridden for the last four months of her pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   The Tiffany lamp came later, one of my mother's finds, when we
moved to an 1865 saltbox farmhouse in Sagaponack, N.Y. (The film
transposed this Long Island locale to Wilmington.)
</P>
<P>
   In front of the large bay windows stood a colonial side table
that held a silver tea set my father had inherited from his mother.
But of course it was not really our table, or our tea set. Dreams
are like this. You find yourself in your own living room and
everything is as it should be, but then you open the front door and
you are standing in a different country.
</P>
<P>
   James Ivory had invited me to the home he had recreated for his
adaptation of my novel, ``A Soldier's Daughter,'' filming in Paris
and Wilmington; it will open on Sept. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Willis, played by Kris Kristofferson, and his wife,
Marcella, played by Barbara Hershey, are the parents of Channe and
their adopted son, Billy, characters I based on the lives of my
father and mother, my brother Jamie and myself.
</P>
<P>
   Jim had warned me that I might be disappointed if his aesthetics
did not reflect ``reality.'' The raw material for my novel was
mined from my childhood memories. So I asked Jim which reality he
meant. His vision? My novel? Or my memories?
</P>
<P>
   On the walls hung three luxuriant Paul Jenkins paintings, on
loan from the artist, a lifelong friend of the family. Near a
bookcase was a replica of an 18th-century wooden pulpit from a
French village church, one of my father's prizes, also purchased at
the Village Suisse and set up as a bar _ the centerpiece of our
Paris living room. This is where James Baldwin had often preached
late at night.
</P>
<P>
   My father had a rule that anyone with a point to make could take
the pulpit and speak uninterrupted for up to 10 minutes. Baldwin,
who came from a long line of Baptist preachers, loved to expound on
racism, maintaining that all white Americans were racist, which
enraged my father, who believed he had thrown off the shackles of
his puritan upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   As a little girl, I would drag my blanket to the living room and
stretch out on the couch, observing these soirees. When my parents'
friends commented that this might not be healthy for a child, my
father would tell them, in no uncertain terms, to mind their own
business. (My father loved his pulpit so much that later, when we
moved to Sagaponack, he had to tear a hole in the wall to get it
into the house.)
</P>
<P>
   The long beige couch was here as well. This was the couch my
mother had collapsed on after my father died; she barely moved for
three weeks as worried friends stood vigil. I'm transported back to
that time. My mother's grief was so extreme, so debilitating, that
she let us fend for ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   We fought terribly, screaming and yelling as our Italian
relatives do. At first, I thought shouting would make her snap out
of it. When that had no effect, I took to drinking in local bars,
sometimes not coming home until after sunrise. She never seemed to
notice.
</P>
<P>
   One night years later, my mother, suddenly worried, asked,
``Where are you going?'' as I headed out the door. ``To a bar,'' I
said vaguely. She told me to be careful, not to come home too late,
which made me burst into hysterical laughter.
</P>
<P>
   I was so angry back then, incapable of understanding what had
befallen me, incapable of forgiving my mother for being paralyzed
by her grief. All that lifted with the arrival of my first child,
now sleeping soundly in her stroller on this set that was a
miraculous reconstruction of my childhood home.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Above the landing hung the Alexander Calder mobile the artist
had given to my father in the early 1960s. They had been fast
friends, my father writing a moving article about Calder's work and
receiving the mobile in exchange. But wait! My mother, unable to
resist an excellent offer, had sold the mobile years ago. How could
it be here? It was a look-alike, of course, but one of such quality
that it fooled my eye.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, on the wall in the boy's room, was a sand-and-glue map
of the United States, as crooked as the one my brother, Jamie, had
made as a schoolboy.
</P>
<P>
   In the girl's room was the watercolor alphabet my parents' dear
friend the artist Addie Herder made for my third birthday. ``A'' is
for Ace, in a family of card players. ``L'' is for Laughing, and
all the faces of my parents' friends stare at me from behind the
glass. ``K,'' in the original, was for Kaylie, and ``J'' for Jones.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, the family moved to eastern Long Island; in the
film, the father returns to his hometown on the southern East
Coast. As Jim envisions the story, the father goes full circle,
from one beautiful vista of water to another, from an apartment on
the Ile St.-Louis overlooking the Seine to a stunning blue marsh
leading to the Atlantic, visible on the horizon. The sun sets pink
and blue over the water. It reminds me of Sagg Pond, with the reeds
swaying in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   My father, who was from southern Illinois, adored the water and
never liked to live far from it. He would have loved this house and
its view, just as he loved the view from his office on the top
floor of the Sagaponack house, which in winter offered vistas of
frozen potato fields and the churning gray ocean in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   When we first moved there in 1975, I would go to him on lonely
afternoons to talk about my troubles fitting in at school. He was
trying desperately to finish his novel ``Whistle,'' knowing that
his heart was failing and that time was running out. He listened
patiently, never telling me to go away.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in this house, I felt like a child again, asking my
mother: When will my father come for me? I wanted to be alone with
my memories, a reality twice removed, a cold comfort that warms one
three times when a novel is transformed into the dramatic vision of
a moving film.
</P>
<P>
   The furniture, the artwork, the reproductions are like our home;
they're not meant for Architectural Digest but as a backdrop for a
celebration of friends still with us, of life and friends lost, and
the words and laughter they left behind.

<P>
   When it comes to pasta, Americans have been on a 20-year
learning curve.
</P>
<P>
   First came spaghetti and macaroni. The sauce was always red.
That was it. ``Pasta'' wasn't even in the vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with the exploding restaurant scene, we discovered
linguine and fettuccine and ziti. Along with those new shapes,
there were new additions to the noodles: spinach and sun-dried
tomato and, in our final chapters, squid ink. And sauces were no
longer just red. We discovered pesto and Alfredo and carbonara.
Now, 62 percent of the country reports cooking pasta at home at
least once a week.
</P>
<P>
   Like most things Americans do, we went whole-hog over pasta. We
bought the $60 pasta machines, we bought the pasta drying racks, we
bought the squid ink. Creative baby boomers, we made the pasta at
home that we were ordering in restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   No more. Now grocery stores stock pastas of a different color
right next to the spaghetti and macaroni. It's not quite to the
squid ink stage _ yet _ but it's possible to buy red bell pepper
penne, lemon pepper fettuccine and garlic and herb linguine along
with glass cleaner and paper towels.
</P>
<P>
   Hershey _ that's right, the chocolate company _ is North
America's No. 1 manufacturer of dried pasta, with seven regional
companies. In this market, American Beauty and Skinner's are both
produced by Hershey. Skinner's is producing lemon pepper pasta,
along with garlic and herb fettuccine and red bell pepper pasta.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to grow pasta as a category, you can do it by
introducing different shapes or different flavors,'' says Natalie
Bailey, manager of corporate communications for Hershey's Pasta and
Grocery Group.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Pasta Association, almost 66 percent
of Americans keep three or more boxes of pasta in the pantry, and
over half buy a variety of shapes.
</P>
<P>
   What can we expect next? Skinner's, for one, has begun
fortifying its pasta with calcium. ``It doesn't affect the taste or
the texture of the pasta at all, and since pasta is inexpensive and
is eaten by a broad spectrum of the population, we decided it was a
benefit,'' Bailey says.
</P>
<P>
   Other innovations include an emerging niche market for organic
pasta. Boston-based New Organics Co.'s line of certified noodles is
widely available at big retailers.
</P>
<P>
   And expect to see more on the shape front. The National Pasta
Association reports higher sales of orzo, due to the emerging
popularity of Mediterranean cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   All of this leads to one question: Does anyone want a pasta
machine _ very good shape, only used once? Will sell cheap.

   And expect to see more on the shape front. The National Pasta
Association reports higher sales of orzo, due to the emerging
popularity of Mediterranean cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   All of this leads to one question: Does anyone want a pasta
machine _ very good shape, only used once? Will sell cheap.

ALBERT FREY: A DESERT PROPHET WINNING NEW DISCIPLES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (bl)  
 By FRANCES ANDERTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM SPRINGS, Calif. _ Albert Frey hates waste. He sees no need
for water-hungry lawns or spacious homes. He lives modestly in a
16-by-32-foot house made of low-maintenance materials that he built
for himself 34 years ago. His principle in life and architecture,
he explained, is to ``do the most with the least.''
</P>
<P>
   So why are the young and the affluent drawn to this 94-year-old
man living in a space they'd normally consider too small to swing a
cat in? Why did Tom Ford of Gucci and the designer Brad Dunning
each commission him to design a versatile aluminum guest house? Why
is his own house the backdrop for fashion shoots and the subject of
a new book?
</P>
<P>
   Because Frey is the embodiment of a minimalist philosophy of
life and design that is enjoying a revival by a generation fattened
on the go-go 1980s and '90s. Nostalgic for the perceived simplicity
of the West Coast modernism of their parents' youth, this
generation has put itself on a visual diet.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, indifference or even neglect of the spare
buildings of pre-World War II and postwar California modernists has
been supplanted by a passion for them. Houses by Richard Neutra,
R.M. Schindler and John Lautner have been flying into the hands of
30- and 40-somethings in entertainment and design.
</P>
<P>
   The trend started in Los Angeles but has shifted 110 miles east
to Palm Springs, which also boasts a wealth of modern buildings by
talented local architects. Thanks to preservationists and fashion
magazines, Palm Springs is fast gaining a belated reputation as the
Miami Beach of midcentury modernism, in which Frey is pre-eminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Frey there would not be any modernism in Palm
Springs,'' said Anthony Merchell, a Los Angeles-based
preservationist and the author of a coming guide to Palm Springs
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   These houses of the '40s and '50s were ``very beautiful and
streamlined and clean,'' said Ron Radziner, a partner in Marmol &AMP;
Radziner Architects, which has restored Neutra and Frey houses
here. ``It's very sad that for a while, a lot of decoration seemed
more important,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Why the interest in Frey? As Jennifer Golub, the director of
broadcast production at TBWA Chiat/Day, and author of ``Albert
Frey/Houses 1 and 2'' (Princeton Architectural Press), put it,
``Frey is a deeply principled person with so much to teach.''
</P>
<P>
   Quiet, gentle, polite and determined, Frey lives on a mountain
overlooking Palm Springs in a building as spare and lean and
elegant as he is. ``There's no body fat on the house, and there's
no body fat on him,'' the architect Michael Rotondi, an admirer,
remarked.
</P>
<P>
   The house, built in 1964 on a difficult site, is habitat pared
down to the barest essentials _ a rectangular, glass-wall shed with
a corrugated aluminum roof, in which dining, living and sleeping
are all configured in one room around a large boulder, which also
provides the lateral bracing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been terrible to cut this rock down,'' Frey said
calmly but emphatically in a German-accented voice. ``Its gray
granite probably took thousands of years to make this color.'' He
added, ``I have very strong opinions about the connection between
architecture and nature.''
</P>
<P>
   His colors are painterly: yellow curtains to match the encelia
plants outside, reddish concrete block to blend with the desert
rock. His clothing, pale yellow slacks and sandy desert boots, are
part of the composition.
</P>
<P>
   Here you find a man at one with his environment, feeding the
lizards, coyotes and a family of quails that show up like favored
guests at his door. He does yoga headstands daily, taught to him by
one of many women who are his friends.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss-born Frey immigrated to the United States in 1930,
with the unusual pedigree of having actually worked in the Paris
office of Le Corbusier. (He casually remarked that he helped detail
the Villa Savoye, one of Le Corbusier's defining buildings.) He
hoped to wed the ideals of European modernism to the technology and
industrial materials in this country. In partnership with Laurence
Kocher, he spent his first few years on the East Coast, exploring
ideas about prefabricated houses, the most famous of which is the
steel and aluminum Aluminaire House at the New York Institute of
Technology in West Islip, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   His license plate reads ``ALUMI,'' in honor of a material he has
loved since he was a child. ``My father had a shaving stick in an
aluminum tube,'' he recalled. ``I used that to make dishes for my
baby sister's doll's house. It doesn't rust. It's easy to work and
needs no maintenance.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1934, he came to Palm Springs and found a new frontier in the
parched desert and mountains. He moved here in 1939 and produced
many landmark buildings, including the Palm Springs City Hall, the
Palm Springs Aerial Tramway and the Tramway Gas Station, all the
while fashioning a modern architecture of organic curves, exposed
desert rocks and unadorned exterior surfaces _ an architecture
superbly suited to the desert climate and landscape.
</P>
<P>
   His first house, Frey 1, now demolished, started in 1940 as a
Miesian pavilion of orthogonal planes and grew more expressionistic
with the 1953 addition of aluminum curving walls and a circular
tower.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To the eyes of those who do not like the industrial esthetic,
Frey House 2, where he lives, is a tin hut. For those that do, it
is an exercise in exquisite frugality.
</P>
<P>
   Like a Swiss watchmaker, he has combined off-the-shelf materials
intricately and cleverly: sliding panels and shelves are made of
corrugated glass fiber; a light switch on the boulder has wires
cleverly concealed in the rock's fissure; a hanging light is a bulb
in a Time-Life globe; outdoor seats are carved in concrete (deck
furniture would decay).
</P>
<P>
   An extension incorporates a Cor-Ten steel _ rather than aluminum
_ roof, which can be spot-welded. ``Modernism is still in the
process of being formed because new products are always being
invented,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Frey's homes are the subject of Ms. Golub's book, an evocative
collection of photographs of the houses and their industrial and
natural sources of inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Springs, which prefers Spanish-style architecture, has been
less than passionate for his work, allowing the demolition or
remodeling of numerous Frey buildings. The city has, however,
started to come around, thanks in large part to a revival of
international interest, sparked by a 1992 book and traveling
exhibition of the architect's work by Joseph Rosa, now chief
curator of the National Building Museum in Washington. With the
approach of Frey's 95th birthday, on Oct. 18, preservationists and
a developer have joined forces to save the Jetsonian Tramway Gas
Station, after a huge battle.
</P>
<P>
   What Frey and his architecture stand for is an inventive,
progressive attitude to life and the environment. So there is an
irony in the nostalgia and sentimentality for the futuristic
buildings by him and his fellow modernists.
</P>
<P>
   In the minds of Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe, of Charles
and Ray Eames and Albert Frey, modernism was a movement, not a
style. It was an all-encompassing social vision in which technology
would liberate humanity from dark, hierarchical buildings and lead
society into a light and egalitarian world. Even though the
buildings never won public acceptance and, then as now, were
occupied mainly by design cognoscenti, modernism was not about
making a fetish of the home.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa said that movies, from James Bond films to ``L.A.
Confidential,'' and Julius Schulman's black-and-white photographs,
have drawn people to the houses. But instead of the ``everyday
modernism of usability, people are trying to live within the style
captured in photos,'' Rosa said.
</P>
<P>
   Dunning, who has produced photo shoots in classic Palm Springs
residences, acknowledges the paradox: ``Are we in the middle of the
revival of a trend, or does this have more longevity?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Frey, who takes delight in the sight of actresses and leggy
models who drape themselves over his little house during fashion
shoots, pointed out that modernism ``isn't like fashion in
clothing.'' He continued: ``Buildings last longer than that. Maybe
later on, people discern certain characteristics that they call a
style. But I would call it being contemporary.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked how his house has withstood the test of time, the
sprightly Frey replied proudly, ``It is forever young.''

TOLUCA, Mexico: elsewhere in town. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   IT'S GENUINE
</P>
<P>
   With 564,000 residents packed into Matlazinco Valley, zones of
Toluca are strictly industrial. Nestle, Bayer and Pfizer
pharmaceutical have manufacturing plants in the city, as do General
Motors, Nissan and Chrysler.
</P>
<P>
   The way Ruben Martinez, co-owner of the Hotel del Rey chain,
figures, ffive out of every 10 visitors to Toluca are traveling on
business to the Chrysler or GM plants, and most of them hail from
Michigan or Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Four of every 10 visitors are in town for sales purposes or on
manufacturing business. Only one of every 10 visitors is a tourist.
</P>
<P>
   But the scarcity of tourists made our visit seem more genuine.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, our charter buses climbed narrow cobblestone
streets through Calixtiahuaca, the village of Toluca's Otomi
Indians. At the plateau, villagers were preparing incense inside
their restored round Templo de Ehecatl-Quetzalcoatl, which they
adapted from pre-Hispanic natives who have since disappeared from
the region.
</P>
<P>
   The tribal chief paid homage to the four directions as he stood
with a stone altar balanced on his head, turning north, south, east
and west. He thanked the sun and the moon, the rain and the Earth
and placed leis of flowers and bread on Fort Worth Mayor Kenneth
Barr and our entourage of city officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our hearts open and big as our arms, and we see you
come with the same intention,'' the chief said. ``We're giving you
a crown of friendship and peace.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, we were shuttled to Villa Charra, Toluca's rodeo
arena, where cowboys in leather sombreros stopped galloping mares
by roping their forelegs, and felled steers by a twist of the tail.
</P>
<P>
   Looking out on the arena from an open-air banquet hall, we
lunched on sauteed cactus that tasted like green beans, and on wild
mushroom soup and fried steak wrapped in ham and cheese.
</P>
<P>
   I opted for shopping at the artisan market _ where a thick
silver photo frame cost me 40 pesos (about $5) _ and a run to a
leather market where I nabbed a supple, dark brown leather blazer
for $105. Counting the two jackets Fort Worth City Manager Bob
Terrell bought, our group nearly cleaned out the tiny store.
</P>
<P>
   Guy, the TCU art professor, and Fort Worth artist Rachel Bounds
opted for an hour's drive to Toluca's Xinantecatl Volcano, where
locals swim and picnic at the Lake of the Sun and the Lake of the
Moon, formed after lava cooled and the mountain's crater filled
with melted snow and rainfall.
</P>
<P>
   The round-trip taxi ride cost about $45, including tip. August
is Toluca's rainy season, and park rangers would allow the taxi to
drive only to a certain point amid the pine trees.
</P>
<P>
   Bounds said she felt like she had run six miles by the time she
hiked 11/2 miles to the peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Halfway up, I needed earmuffs,'' Bounds said. ``The native
hikers had on heavy jackets. It was breezy, the kind of wind that's
like a cold knife.''
</P>
<P>
   Bounds said that from the crest of the crater, she saw a car
parked by the crystal blue Lake of the Moon and people splashing in
the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, we don't have a volcano'' in Fort Worth, she said.
``This one's great. And it's like the local people's park, their
hideout.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials and the staff of Fort Worth Sister Cities are
developing an agenda for Toluca residents who visit Texas Oct.
21-25 for an official signing ceremony here.

TOLUCA, MEXICO, WEAVES AN AUTHENTIC SPELL
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by BC-TRAVEL-TOLUCAFRIENDS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KRISTIN N. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOLUCA, Mexico _ A cranky travel editor once told me, ``Sister
Cities are not a travel destination.'' In some ways, I'd agree.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth's partners through the nonprofit organization Sister
Cities International aren't often advertised in vacation magazines
or on travel videos. Toluca, like Bandung, Indonesia; Budapest,
Hungary; Trier, Germany; Reggio Emilia, Italy; and Nagaoka, Japan,
isn't a place where travel-package-oriented Americans are
programmed to go.
</P>
<P>
   It took our 115-member group almost two hours by chartered bus
to weave through bumper-to-bumper traffic from the Mexico City
airport about 40 miles southwest to Toluca _ though in fairness, we
made one stop for water, sodas and beer. There were some problems
after we arrived. The toilet in my hotel room clogged up. My
roommate never got the extra hangers she requested from the front
desk.
</P>
<P>
   But the difference between traveling to a Sister City and going
on your own is the difference between seeing a town as a tourist
and being shown around by friends.
</P>
<P>
   In Toluca, civic leaders, restaurant owners and regular folks
worked hard to show us the best elements of their central-Mexico
city.
</P>
<P>
   A botanic garden with fresh eucalyptus growing beneath walls of
stained glass. A ``charreada'' _ Mexican rodeo _ in which cowboys
ride alongside a steer and twist the animal's tail till the steer
dropps. A mountaintop ceremony at Toluca's rounded temple during
which Otomi Indians welcome visiting civic leaders by adorning them
with necklaces of flowers and bread. These are the images I
remember.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   TRADITION AND MIRACLES
</P>
<P>
   Psychologist Andrew Wolf left Brooklyn 20 years ago to study
dentistry in Toluca. Now, he's married to a blond native, has two
children and is working in counseling again, he said, because the
country's recent economic turmoil ``has produced a lot of depressed
Mexicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf, however, seemed chipper as he guided us past Toluca's
numerous computer and electronics shops and the ``zapaterias,'' or
shoe stores, on every corner.
</P>
<P>
   The capital city lies at nearly 8,700 feet above sea level at
the southern end of the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain chain.
Temperatures vary between freezing when snow falls in the winter to
a comfortable 85 degrees in August.
</P>
<P>
   Toluca is centered on a traditional Spanish town square _ the
governor's executive palace to the north, the judiciary to the
west, the state legislative offices to the east and the municipal
government parallel with the cathedral to the south.
</P>
<P>
   To one side of the plaza, three women knelt to pray inside the
Templo de la Santa Veracruz, a small church built about 1800 and
known for its Christo Negro, the Black Christ sculpture hanging
behind the altar.
</P>
<P>
   Locals say a group of salesmen brought the Black Christ to the
church and sought 13 coins from the priest, then disappeared before
the priest could pay. The Christ's arms keep growing, afd!his
facial features are becoming disfigured the longer he hangs, Jesus
Izquierdo told our group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do the locals really believe that?'' I later asked my
roommate, Victoria, a Mexico City native familiar with her
country's Catholic traditions that often mix mysticism and
religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course they believe it,'' she said. ``You are not to ask
them that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wolf said that Tolucans generally don't waste time being
offended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike in a lot of the tourist spots, Tolucans have no
resentment for foreigners,'' he said. ``They like foreigners.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   GARDENS AND GLASS
</P>
<P>
   Farther down the plaza stands the Cosmovitral and Jardin
Botanico, Toluca's lush municipal garden housed in a former public
market where food and goods were traded from 1933 to 1975, when the
market closed.

<P>
   In 1980, artist Leopoldo Flores, now the director of Toluca's
Modern Art Museum, imported glass from Italy and Czechoslovakia and
encircled a new garden in the world's largest art nouveau display
of stained glass.
</P>
<P>
   At the entrance, a modernistic rendering of a man otherwise akin
to Leonardo da Vinci's famed sketches is pinned in the center of a
brilliantly orange, red and yellow sunburst. Inside, the story of
man and woman and their relationship with the cosmos unfolds in
3,000 square meters of blue, green, purple, orange and yellow
glass.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Guy, an associate art professor from Texas Christian
University along on the trip, called the stained glass ``quite
elaborate,'' and said seeing such work ``expands you visually.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the garden, trailers carrying a giraffe and ponies moved
slowly along the plaza while a barker with a loudspeaker called
people to attend tonight's circus elsewhere in town.

 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    I don't care about Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky.
 &HT;    For months, preachers and pundits have chided the unconcerned
masses -- in whose ranks I find myself -- about our laissez-faire
attitude regarding morality.
 &HT;    Surely, these critics scold, America is morally bankrupt. Does
anyone care that the president cheated on his wife and lied about
it?
 &HT;    Although I can't speak for my fellow citizens, I know why this
scandal fails to engender my moral outrage. I have been overwhelmed
with family matters and have little energy to expend worrying about
who did what with whom.
 &HT;    This summer, as Clinton's troubles multiplied, my father
struggled with lung cancer. For nearly two years, he had fought the
disease with dignity -- using his own small victories to cheer
others fighting cancer.
 &HT;    As the months passed, however, his pain increased and his breath
shortened. Three weeks ago, his lungs collapsed and he died in my
mother's and sister's arms.
 &HT;    Within a few days, my mother, overcome by stress, suffered a
heart attack.
 &HT;    For my family, the nightly news mattered little -- background
noise as we planned my father's funeral; something to watch while
waiting outside the emergency room.
 &HT;    Bill and Monica? Kenneth Starr? Perjury? Those were not our
questions.
 &HT;    Rather, we puzzled over an open casket, an appropriate memorial,
and the funeral sermon. And, the most immediate concern, would mom
make it?
 &HT;    My parents -- not famous, rich, or well-educated -- were always
profoundly decent people. Like everyone, they made mistakes and did
not always make wise choices. They were not perfect parents.
 &HT;    However, they lived with the quiet dignity of many Americans who
try to be good and do the right things. Their world centered on
children and church, monthly bills and the mortgage.
 &HT;    This summer, my father's illness and death pulled me away from
``big issues,'' writing projects, and scholarly research. My
parents needed me. They needed to talk about their fears and needed
to spend time with my daughter. They needed to share memories and
make new ones while there was still time. They needed hands held as
they walked through the journey to death.
 &HT;    My parents' gallant sojourn taught me -- as I have never known
before -- that life's simplest joys are its richest. A dying man
crying as his wife holds him. Pleasure over seeing one's
granddaughter in a pink ruffled party dress. Recalling birthdays,
anniversaries, and family vacations. Telling stories of military
service and old flames.
 &HT;    When I was a bit younger, such things seemed boring and dull.
Now I understand that memories and family stories, common joys and
sorrows weave together lives and generations in what Christian
tradition calls ``the communion of saints.''
 &HT;    My parents persisted in faith in the face of pain and fear to
the end. My father's courage and my mother's compassion (stressful
though it was) have become part of the journey -- for them, for me,
for their grandchildren.
 &HT;    Their struggle was heroic. But it remained hidden to most of the
world. This passion played itself out in the confines of their
family, neighborhood, church, and jobs.
 &HT;    It is on such small stages that most of us enact our own dramas.
In terms of what ``counts'' as fame or influence, my parents --
like most of us -- were not candidates for the nightly news.
 &HT;    Yet these dramas, shape us and enrich our lives. In life's
common places, we face tragedy and triumph, become heroes of our
own epics, and find the mysteries of the universe revealed. In
small ways, faith, hope, and love confront us with powers beyond
our ken. We meet grace. We find God in the journey.
 &HT;    So, columnists and preachers, I do not care about Bill and
Monica because I am busy with the mystery and sadness of death and
helping my mother recover and pay her bills.
 &HT;    I do, however, care about fidelity and truth-telling; I care
about how such things played out for my parents and me. From our
struggles, I know about moral leadership, sin, forgiveness, grace
and mercy. I know -- and care -- about such things.
 &HT;    But I couldn't care less about your political agendas telling me
who, what, and how to forgive.
 &HT;    My parents quietly embodied the courage of a 40-year marriage --
of love, companionship, forgiveness, of birth and death. American
moral decline? My parents? The millions like them?
 &HT;    We care, but we're too busy raising children and paying bills to
obsess about presidential scandal. Sure, we're disappointed, but we
know Bill and Monica are human, too. Their mistakes happen to be on
a bigger stage than ours.
 &HT;    And that's their tragedy. Most of us have the grace of quiet
lives.

<P>
   TOLUCA, MEXICO _ We had munched spicy Fritos for an hour between
shots of tequila and Sangrita, a peppery tomato juice, when Claudia
Izquierdo moved us out of her living room and around a hand-carved
dh~ing table.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Izquierdo, Claudia's husband of two years, spread out the
late-hour meal: handmade corn tortillas, shredded pork enchiladas
marinated in orange juice and cilantro, seasoned pork and beef
tacos topped with a pineapple chunk and sweet pearl onions broiled
until their skin turned crispy.
</P>
<P>
   At each place, Jesus set a tiny cup of red salsa, which Claudia
said we should spoon onto everything. She didn't say the salsa's
habanero chiles were hot enough to permanently numb your tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Dining and talking at the Izquierdo home was what made a trip to
Toluca, the capital of the state of Mexico, unique compared with
the typical Mexican beach jaunt I've done every few years since a
college spring break in Puerta Vallarta.
</P>
<P>
   Through Sister Cities International, 115 Fort Worth residents
were shown around town by new friends: accountants, physicians,
ranchers and teachers who make their home in the mountain-lined
valley southwest of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   By midnight of my last evening, through my fractured Spanish and
Claudia Izquierdo's better English, I pieced together key events in
the couple's lives.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus, at age 30 the youngest member of the Toluca City Council,
had met Claudia while they were studying political science at the
University of the State of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The couple dated for five years, married and both worked until
they decided to try for a baby. Claudia now was 71/2 months
pregnant, and still energetic enough to entertain her American
guests into the early morning.
</P>
<P>
   When we could finally eat no more, she handed us each a gift bag
filled with a set of hand-painted mariachis and a clay tree of
life, a traditional Mexican decoration adorned with faces and
leaves, and painted with our names at the base.
</P>
<P>
   On an enclosed card, Claudia wrote: ``This is your Mexican
home.''

who had died before ever getting to know his son. Despite the
hardships, he excelled in school, eventually earning a law degree.
</P>
<P>
   Always a popular student leader, he used his telegenic looks and
command of the language to quickly win political office as a
liberal _ gaining a reputation as a womanizer along the way. But
after watching his party lose favor with the public in the late
1980s, he made the decision to move his political message to the
center.
</P>
<P>
   To Americans, of course, this is Bill Clinton. To Germans, the
man is Gerhard Schroeder, the governor of Lower Saxony who hopes to
unseat Chancellor Helmut Kohl in national elections on Sept. 27.
</P>
<P>
   But Schroeder's uncanny similarity to Clinton is only one part
of this race for chancellor that would seem familiar to Americans.
In fact, the elections here have shaped up in a way that would give
many Americans a distinct feeling of deja vu.
</P>
<P>
   Like the 1992 presidential election between George Bush and
Clinton, Germans must choose between an old-school leader whose
party has controlled the country's most powerful office for well
over a decade, and a charismatic baby boomer who seems better at
delivering speeches than reconciling the contradictory policies
contained within them.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Bush focused on his foreign policy successes _ such as
the Gulf War _ Kohl, head of the ruling Christian Democratic Union,
has trumpeted his key role in unifying Germany and setting the
stage for Europe's single currency.
</P>
<P>
   Following the blueprint of Clinton's campaign, Schroeder, leader
of the opposition Social Democrats, has hammered away at domestic
issues, particularly Germany's 10.6 percent unemployment rate _ one
the highest levels since the end of World War II. Schroeder even
has adopted the old Clinton campaign line, ``It's the economy,
stupid!''
</P>
<P>
   Though Schroeder, 54, acknowledges the chancellor's foreign
policy achievements, he echoes the sentiments of many voters who
are tired of 16 years of Kohl leadership with the cheeky slogan:
``Thank you Helmut, but that's enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The election will be the third since German unification in 1990
and arguably will be the county's most important since World War
II. It will determine how the economic powerhouse of Europe defines
its future and how it exerts is mighty influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Germany has become the driving force behind European unity
under Kohl, but its stumbling economy has the potential of pulling
the country's attention away from European goals,'' said Thomas
Banchoff, a German expert at Georgetown University in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Despite modest signs of life in recent months, Germany's economy
has stagnated over the past decade as companies have struggled to
compete in the global economy. Economists blame the country's
problems on restrictive labor laws, high taxes, generous welfare
benefits and the highest wage rates in the world _ the average
German worker earns $28 per hour, compared with $18 an hour for an
American worker.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl, 68, says his country can no longer afford the costs of
``big government'' and has vowed to fix the economy by giving
employers more freedom in hiring and firing workers, cutting
unemployment and health care benefits and opening German markets to
greater foreign competition.
</P>
<P>
   Although his party supports a large government role in the
economy, Schroeder _ much to consternation of the chancellor _ has
adopted many of Kohl's more conservative positions on the economy
but has promised to make the painful changes without lowering
living standards.
</P>
<P>
   How Schroeder plans to cut the size of the government while
continuing to provide Germans with the welfare benefits they have
come to expect is a question the candidate has managed to avoid so
far in his election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't quite get hold of him,'' Josef Joffe, editorial page
editor of the Sueddeutsche Zeitung of Munich, one of Germany's
largest newspapers, wrote last month. ``He tries to placate the
left wing of his party and to win over the swing voters at the same
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the seeming contradictions in his policies _ another
similarity to the American president _ Schroeder's Social Democrats
were running well ahead of the CDU in polls throughout the spring
and summer. But as the elections have approached, the Social
Democrats have watched their 9-point lead in the polls erode to 3
points.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl also received a boost last week when his political allies
in Bavaria won re-election, overcoming several polls that predicted
they would be pushed out of power.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly a third of the voters remaining undecided, the
national contest now appears to be anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the election draws near, I think German voters are
beginning to take a harder look at Schroeder's policies, and
they're realizing that they don't always make sense,'' said Jackson
Janes, executive director of the American Institute for
Contemporary Germany Studies at Johns Hopkins University in
Baltimore.

</P>
<P>
   Along with the economy, immigration has emerged as the other
main election issue.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Germany has maintained an open door for refugees,
accepting between 300,000 and 400,000 annually _ more than the rest
of Europe combined. Today, 7.5 million foreigners _ about 9 percent
of the population _ live in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But faced with more than 4 million unemployed workers, some
voters worry that foreigners are taking away jobs from German
citizens. Some Germans also blame foreigners for rising crime
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Picking up on this voter sentiment, Kohl in July endorsed a
``security initiative'' in Bavaria that will seek to expel all
foreigners guilty of serious crimes and that will step up searches
for illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that immigration is the kind of issue that can be
used by Kohl and the CDU to win votes,'' Janes said.
</P>
<P>
   But the key to the election, according to many political
observers, is eastern Germany, which continues to struggle with the
economic and cultural changes brought on by the collapse of
communism.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's victories in 1990 and 1994 owed much to the strong
support the chancellor received in eastern Germany, whose voters
saw him as their best hope to bring prosperity to the region's
devastated economy.
</P>
<P>
   But with unemployment in the eastern states at nearly 18
percent, the political calculations have changed dramatically.
Recent polls show that Kohl's Christian Democrats would receive
less than half of the 39 percent of the vote the party garnered in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   With Kohl and Schroeder running neck-and-neck among western
Germans, voters in the eastern states could prove to be the swing
vote needed to put one party over the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people in the East are lost under the West German system
and, right or wrong, they blame Kohl because he is seen as the
personification of unification,'' said Andreas Tauscher, an
architecture student in Berlin.

 &HT;    'SAFE HARBOR' TO BE GRANTED TO YEAR 2000 PROBLEM SOLVERS
 &HT;    480&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Under a bipartisan deal announced Wednesday, ``good
Samitarians'' are free come to the aid of computer users bitten by
the millennium bug without fear of being sued for bad advice.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, soon to be cleared for quick floor action in Congress,
refines legislation that had been sought in July by President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   By providing a ``safe harbor'' for parties who share information
in good faith, it could help smooth the way toward fixing the
so-called Year 2000 problem. Known in trade circles as Y2K, the
glitch prevents older software and millions of embedded chips from
reading the correct date after Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those just getting started on their Year 2000 efforts
around the world, this information may mean the difference between
success and failure of systems on Jan. 1, 2000, John Koskinen, the
administration's point figure on the problem, noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bill provides that written statements concerning Y2K
readiness or remediation may not be used as an admission of
liability in court,'' Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah., told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   While promoting the sharing of data, the bargain ``also ensures
fairness because it does not prevent aggrieved parties from
litigating claims concerning related Y2K computer or product
failures,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators voiced pride that they were able to reach a
consensus despite what Hatch described without elaboration as ``the
current highly charged climate in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   On another computer policy front, the administration Wednesday
relaxed export controls on data scrambling equipment, setting the
stage for another round of debate over encryption issues.
</P>
<P>
   The changes ease stringent licensing of encryption technology
that uses digital codes, or ``keys,'' longer than 40 bits in
length. Top federal law enforcement and intelligence officials had
insisted on those restrictions to prevent encoding technology from
being used to thwart investigative or surveillance work.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year, some exports of equipment whose keys are as
long as 56 bits, or roughly 64,000 times more powerful than 40-bit
products, have been permitted. The exceptions went to firms who
agreed to develop technologies that gave law enforcement ``lawful
access'' to messages encrypted with their products through built-in
``back doors.''
</P>
<P>
   Those exceptions have now been extended to cover insurance
companies, handlers of medical records and companies that use
specialized transaction software to do business over the Internet.
They will be able to buy 56-bit American encryption software after
a one-time review of their purchase plans by the Commerce
Department.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the government will no longer require prior
approval of ``key recovery'' agents, who hold the spare keys to
encoded messages for law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The Electronic Frontier Foundation unveiled a computer in June
that can decode messages encrypted with 56-bit keys within a few
hours. Until recently, the FBI had claimed such messages could be
cracked only in a matter of months, if not years.
</P>
<P>
   Most large U.S. firms insist on powerful 128-bit keys, and those
remain strictly off limits to American exporters _ even though
overseas software firms are rapidly developing their own 128-bit
products.
</P>
<P>
   About 45 nations will be eligible for even the exceptions
announced Wednesday. Countries that won't qualify include Russia,
China, Venezuela and Mexico, because U.S. authorities contend they
harbor money-laundering operations.
</P>
<P>
   The liberalization move falls short of what administration
critics had sought.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as far along as my bill would go, but it's a
significant improvement on our current policy,'' said Rep. Zoe
Lofgren, D-Calif., a sponsor of encryption liberalization
legislation. ``It will still give us something to argue about next
year.''

STUDY SAYS ATV INJURIES SHOULD SOUND SAFETY ALARM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DON FINLEY  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ It may come as no great surprise that safety is
not the first consideration for people flying over hills and
ditches in those three- and four-wheel, all-terrain vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   But a new analysis of one group of patients who smashed their
faces after flipping or crashing into trees had even the study's
authors shaking their heads in wonder: A fair number of wounded had
shunned helmets and were drunk as they drove around in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ludicrous. And they're riding around in the woods!'' said
Dr. B. Joseph Touma, chief otolaryngology resident at the West
Virginia University School of Medicine in Morgantown.
</P>
<P>
   Touma presented the findings Wednesday at the annual meeting of
the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, held
in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The study examined medical records of 153 patients admitted to
the West Virginia University hospital system between 1990 and 1996
with ATV-related injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, 33 suffered severe facial injuries requiring an
average of 6.5 days in the hospital. Twenty-five of the 33 required
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Only two of 21 patients wearing helmets suffered facial
fractures; conversely, 89.5 percent of those who suffered facial
fractures were not wearing helmets.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the nighttime accidents and one-fifth of the
day accidents were alcohol-related.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 33 who suffered serious facial injuries, one in five was
under age 16.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest patient was 2, riding with an older driver, and the
oldest was 70.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of kids out there riding these vehicles,'' Touma
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tend to have a higher severity of injury as compared to
adults with similar injuries. We found 57 percent of the kids who
had facial injuries required some intensive-care unit
hospitalization, compared to 19 percent of the adults with facial
injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission reported 2,638
ATV-related deaths nationwide between 1982 and 1995. The death rate
has declined, particularly since the government banned the sale of
three-wheel ATVs in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Still, accidents are common. In 1994, 59,200 injuries were
reported across the country, 24,800 of them involving people under
age 16.
</P>
<P>
   Touma believes the vehicles are ``inherently dangerous,'' but
added that some common-sense approaches can reduce the risk of
serious injuries for those who drive them.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of those things is wear a helmet. Another is being sober.
Driving in the daytime is another. And those things are so terribly
common-sensical, but our reports showed that those people that
didn't follow those common-sense recommendations had worse
injuries,'' he said.

IZZARD-COMEDY (Los Angeles) _ Pay no attention to that man in
frosted blond hair, eyeliner, dark toenail polish and a Chinese
silk jacket. Sure, Eddie Izzard's a transvestite, but that's only a
veneer. Behind it lurks one of the brightest young comics on either
side of the Atlantic. By Reed Johnson.

MOL-MOVIE (Los Angeles) _ Talk about a winning hand. Gretchen Mol,
a 25-year-old, New York-based actress, is playing leading lady to

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Talk about a winning hand.
</P>
<P>
   Gretchen Mol, a 25-year-old, New York-based actress, is playing
leading lady to the two hottest young actors of the year: Matt
Damon in the just-released gambling drama ``Rounders'' and Leonardo
DiCaprio in Woody Allen's upcoming comedy, ``Celebrity.'' She also
nailed the coveted cover of Vanity Fair magazine last month,
striking a provocative pose that will not soon be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   But despite all the apparent hype, Mol remains a thoughtful
actress committed to doing good, interesting work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what being a celebrity will actually feel like,''
says Mol, the daughter of a Connecticut school administrator and an
artist/teacher. ``The truth is that it hasn't really happened to
me. I think people need to see you in a couple of films, get to
know your work before they acknowledge it. Which is good.''
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, there hasn't been a real lot to get to know. Mol had
tiny roles in Spike Lee's ``Girl 6,'' Abel Ferrara's ``The
Funeral'' and Mike Newell's ``Donnie Brasco,'' and a bigger part in
the little-seen ``The Last Time I Committed Suicide.'' The romantic
comedy ``Music From Another Room,'' which sports Mol's first lead
role, is in distribution limbo.
</P>
<P>
   But she's content, at the moment, to take superstar lessons from
the experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the whole progression when I was working with Matt,''
she says of the ``Good Will Hunting'' Oscar winner. ``It was
interesting, but I'm glad I didn't have that intimidation factor
because it was all sort of after the fact. It might be a little
more difficult going in to work with him now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrity'' was shot last fall before ``Titanic'' made
DiCaprio the most adored actor in the world. He was still pretty
hot at the time, but Mol reports that Allen, whose film parodies
the culture's obsession with fame, allowed no acknowledgment of
anything like that on the set.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both just terrific actors, and that's what you're
working with and dealing with,'' she says of her two co-stars.
``You don't really feel the celebritydom with either one of them,
which is nice.'' Mol's own entry into acting was as unglamorous as
they come. At age 10, she'd play the girl who usually died at the
end of her brother Jim's Super 8 slasher movies. At 18, she moved
to Manhattan (Jim was going to NYU's famed film school), where she
studied musical theater and checked coats at a trendy restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a part in Woody Allen's next movie and two more
independent features, ``Finding Graceland'' and ``Too Tired to
Die,'' awaiting release.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, that revealing, endlessly discussed magazine
cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be honest; initially, I thought, `This is provocative,'
'' she admits. ``But it's one of those things where you then have
to find a peace within yourself with it, not be ashamed of it and
not be embarrassed by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was excited about it,'' she admits. ``And it was nice
when it did come out, because you get a lot of phone calls from
people you haven't heard from and letters from old friends and
stuff. That's really important. That's when you really feel like,
OK, this is going to be a good ride.''!end! &QL;

   Computer Ranks Getting Broader &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A new survey indicates that 1999 will bring a marked shift in
who the first-time home computer buyers will be. The study, by
Forrester Research of Cambridge, Mass., found that low-income
households, defined as those earning less than $35,000 a year,
would become the leading source of first-time home computer
purchasers.
</P>
<P>
   Among those first-time buyers, only 37 percent will have
attended college and 59 percent will be women, the study concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures run counter to the stereotype of a computer buyer
as an affluent man with enough graduate degrees to wallpaper the
inside of his Lexus. But the Forrester survey indicated that, in
contrast with first-time buyers, the majority of repeat home
computer buyers in 1999 would be men and that 65 percent of them
would have attended college.
</P>
<P>
   Shelley Morrisette, a co-author of the study, said two of the
factors behind the demographic shift were a drop in the price of
home computers, which has made them more affordable for people with
lower incomes, and the simple fact that a growing number of
Americans want to own a computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may not know what the Net is, but they know something
is out there and it seems to be exciting,'' Morrisette said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he cautions computer makers and Internet access
companies that they will have to be ready to deal with consumers
who know little about technology.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester reports that 72 percent of first-time buyers do not
use a computer at work, a shift away from more technology-savvy
consumers of the past. Translation: tech support budgets will need
to rise, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The down side is these people are going to require a whole lot
of hand-holding,'' Morrisette said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Filter for Internet Smut Zaps the Starr Report &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At least one software company is bragging that it can do a
highly effective job of keeping the work of Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel, from reaching your home computer.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to capitalize on the goings-on in Washington, the
company, Cybersitter, fired off a press release late last week
announcing that its filtering software could keep children from
viewing the salacious details in Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   Cybersitter, based in Santa Barbara, Calif., is one of a handful
of programs marketed to parents and teachers as a way to keep
children from viewing lurid content and hate speech.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Kantor, vice president for marketing at Cybersitter, said
the program would not filter out documents just because they
included the word ``sex'' but that it was programmed to filter out
content that mentioned oral sex or discussions of sexually explicit
activity.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the software might inadvertently prevent students from
learning about important civic matters, Kantor said he urged
parents not to rely solely on the software but to read the document
and make their own decisions about suitability of the content. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On-Line Place to Polish a College-Bound Image  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an interview for admission to college, it is best to begin by
saying to the alumni representative:
</P>
<P>
   (a) I like your office. (b) Thanks for taking the time to meet
with me. (c) Do you mind if my mother joins us?
</P>
<P>
   That is among the questions in a new online quiz game called
College Hot Seat. The game is the work of Kaplan Interactive, a
division of Kaplan Educational Centers, which offers coaching for
college and graduate admissions tests (www.kaplan.
com/hotseat.htm).
</P>
<P>
   To win at the game _ and wind up with an admission offer _
players must successfully answer 15 questions about how best to
handle themselves during an interview. Wrong answers, like asking
to invite one's mother into the interview, lead you to an
explanation of the mistake.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to College Hot Seat, Kaplan offers a handful of
other interactive quiz games, including one for college graduates
seeking jobs and one for students applying for financial aid. The
existence of all these quizzes begs an additional multiple-choice
question, namely: The purpose of the online quizzes is:
</P>
<P>
   (a) To help students prepare for their futures. (b) To promote
Kaplan, in a bit of thinly veiled marketing. (c) To help students
learn to separate from their mothers. &QL;

   You Can Surf Together But Who Gets to Drive? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who's ready for a browser built for two?
</P>
<P>
   Hip Bone Software of Palo Alto, Calif., recently released
Co-navigator, a Java applet that permits individuals sitting at
separate computers to surf the Web together (www. hipbone.com).
</P>
<P>
   The software, which takes only a couple of seconds to download,
enables two or more computers to communicate so their users see the
same Web pages. When one person moves to a URL, the browsers on the
other computers follow.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Hip Bone is giving away the software on its Web site.
Dan Rolla, a co-founder of Hip Bone, said the company hoped that
the technology would become so popular that it would be able to
license versions of the software, sell advertising space on
Co-navigator and gather and sell data on the surfing habits of
people traveling the Net together.
</P>
<P>
   So who gets to control the browser when there is a disagreement
over a destination? Whoever types in a URL first, Rolla said.
Sounds as though this could make battles over the television remote
control look like child's play. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Computer Use at Home Looks a Lot Like Work &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With rich audio, video and multimedia capabilities, the home
computer is marketed as a veritable home entertainment center. But
a new survey says it is used more often for banal tasks like word
processing than for saving the galaxy in colorful video games or
setting up elaborate databases to keep track of expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, which looked for the 50 most popular software
programs for home computers, found that the most popular ones were
business-related applications. The three programs used most often
were Microsoft Office, Microsoft Word and Microsoft Notepad,
according to the survey, which was done by Media Metrix and
involved putting meters on 28,000 home computers to track usage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most assumptions are that home-market people are using Quicken
or doing personal productivity, but we're finding the people are
using business applications,'' said Bruce Ryon, senior vice
president of the technology division of Media Metrix.
</P>
<P>
   From this data, Ryon concludes that employees and students are
taking their work home with them.
</P>
<P>
   There is one positive note for people who are inclined against
too much home productivity. The game Interplay Solitaire placed
sixth in the survey, which may mean that people are using their
computers at home for exactly what they use them for at work.
</P>
<P>
   The list also shows the growing dominance of Microsoft, which
makes 7 of the top 10 programs used most often. In fact, Ryon said
the study indicated that home computer owners spent 53 percent of
their time using Microsoft software. ``Everyone else is left to
fight over the remaining 47 percent,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Piano Sounds Grand With a Digital Conductor &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Baldwin Piano and Organ Co. is making it awfully easy to
play a grand piano. You need not take piano lessons _ or even be in
the same room as the piano _ but it may help to know how to use a
disk drive.
</P>
<P>
   The latest creation by Baldwin, based in Cincinnati, is Concert
Master, which turns a handmade grand piano, or an upright, into a
player piano with the help of an on-board computer and hard drive.
Plus, the piano's computer can be hooked into a high-fidelity
system or a VCR and monitor to provide audio and video
accompaniment for the phantom pianist.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin's operating system can record and play back music
performed on the piano or can play professionally recorded tracks
stored on compact or floppy disks or as sound tracks for videos of
piano performances. For the truly back-seat piano player, the
system can be run by a remote control.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this kind of absentee piano playing doesn't come
cheap. Baldwin wants $8,000 for the Concert Master, plus the cost
of the piano.
</P>
<P>
   The Concert Master won last weekend in the category of best
product technology at the trade show of the Custom Electronic
Design Installer Association, a group of major home entertainment
companies.
</P>
<P>
   So what would Mozart think? ``He would've been blown away,''
insisted Frank Seta, vice president of the piano division at
Baldwin.

FASHIONING THE FALL LOOK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Fashion fans aren't ready to let go of the past.
</P>
<P>
   The new century is waiting in the wings, yet designers and the
women they dress remain fascinated with styles from the '30s, '40s
and early '50s. According to Elena Hart of the New York-based
Fashion Association, ``Fall fashion reflects Broadway, Hollywood
and pop culture's love affair with cafe society.''
</P>
<P>
   She thinks it may be due to the recent success of Broadway's
Tony-winning musical ``Cabaret,'' but if you can't get to the East
Coast, you can get the mood of the moment by checking out those
sassy little suits worn by Claudette Colbert in ``It Happened One
Night,'' and Marlene Dietrich in ``Witness for the Prosecution.''
Or blow the dust off your old ``Nancy Drew'' mystery books and
study her fashion clues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, it's the year of the suit,'' says Sears fashion
director Fran Yoshioka, who adds, ``The mood for fall is sumptuous,
as plush and luxe fabrics cross over to day wear.''
</P>
<P>
   Zero in on those old Hollywood films _ and fall's early arrivals
at stores _ and you'll see plenty of suity silhouettes. They may be
made of masculine fabrics such as tweed, plaid and pinstripes, but
the details are girly, with small shoulders, narrow sleeves and
nipped waists. The color palette is traditional autumn (rich reds
and browns, cool grays and purples), and even the face-framing hats
are right out of Mom's old trunk.
</P>
<P>
   But don't think museum quality.
</P>
<P>
   These suits and the new skirt and sweater ensembles are loaded
with fresh touches (spandex woven into wool, slit skirts) designed
for the modern woman who's spending more time at the office than
the ladies' club. And, although they may be accessorized with
frivolous touches such as a feather ruff, mink trim, velvet collar
or a fringed scarf, they carry much more clout than last year's
slip dresses.
</P>
<P>
   It's a year when details count, so buy that little hat you
always wanted _ and go heavy on the embroidery, the scarves, the
dragonfly pins and the pearls. It's a bohemian fantasy that feels
good after spare-and-spartan styles.
</P>
<P>
   To show you how to take a basic suit and make it your own, we
turned to Mia Cottet, the madcap star of Fox's new fashion-fantasy
sitcom ``Living in Captivity.'' She slipped in and out of several
new numbers by the likes of Donna Karan, Ellen Tracy, Jones New
York and Oscar de la Renta for our fall fashion layout.
</P>
<P>
   According to Cottet, a former showgirl (she says she was Prince
Rainier III's favorite), ``The new fashions are glamorous and fun,
but I think it's important to put your own twist on them through
accessories. Think about the women of the '30s and '40s and how
they wore hats and created mystery. Of course, they probably spent
three hours to get ready, but they looked so put together.''
</P>
<P>
   Stopping only to catch her breath and change clothes, the
coquettish Cottet talked nonstop about fashion (she never wears
jeans), comedy (``I love being silly'') and how she became an
actress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't go to college, didn't win beauty contests and didn't
pose for Playboy magazine. Actually I went to the School of
American Ballet at 14 to become a ballerina but changed my mind. I
started working as a showgirl _ actually more what you'd call a
cabaret performer _ in Japan, Montreal, Paris and Monte Carlo. And,
no, I wasn't a stripper, and no, I didn't ever work in Las Vegas,''
says Cottet. ``But I do like feather boas, stilettos and the color
fuchsia.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and she also likes Richard Gere. ``He's the sexiest man
alive. I've seen `American Gigolo' 50 times,'' she quips.
</P>
<P>
   After lots of auditions and parts in sitcoms that never made it
to TV, Cottet says she finally got a role on the pilot ``Alhambra
Nights,'' (as a showgirl, of course) and an invitation to ``The
Tonight Show With Jay Leno.'' ``And I have to tell you, I'm
offended,'' she giggles again. ``He didn't ask me if I was wearing
underwear.''
</P>
<P>
   The leggy blonde does wear underwear, but in her new series that
takes place in the suburban community of Valencia, she's more often
seen in sexy lingerie by Frederick's of Hollywood and Trashy
Lingerie in Los Angeles. Or clingy clothes by Parallel and Max
Azria of BCBG.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see,'' she explains, ``my character Lisa has lots of money
but isn't allowed to go anywhere except shopping and to the hair
salon because her husband is so high maintenance (needy) ... so she
has plenty of time to coordinate her fashion stance,'' explains
Cottet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, my character might wear this,'' Cottet says as she
prances around the studio in a leopard print suit with a
pencil-slim skirt swinging a big black feather boa. ``And this
pleated skirt and sweater? Very French schoolgirl. Hmmm. Maybe Lisa
would wear it when she goes to back to school, which happens later
in the series.''
</P>
<P>
   Next is a purple plaid suit with a velvet collar and matching
hat. She looks like a character out of ``It Happened One Night,''
until you notice her bare legs. Cottet has left the heavy hosiery
and ladylike T-straps in the dressing room and added her own purple
high-heeled sandals that show off toenails painted a deep rouge.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well. Fashion, like comedy, should be fun.

 By JULIE V. IOVINE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A moire pattern of shimmering light bounces off a
grid of copper mesh _ not the usual sight one would expect in the
stair hall of a grand old Brooklyn town house. The florid whorls of
carved plaster moldings, maybe; the ample curve of a stolid wooden
banister, of course. But a two-story wall of metal mesh layered on
linen?
</P>
<P>
   And that's but one of many experimental metal applications
appearing throughout the pristine late-19th-century house. What
would Edith Wharton think of shades woven with metal threads? Or
coming at it from this end of the century: Since when did high tech
get so sexy?
</P>
<P>
   Like Sabrina in the movies, you wouldn't recognize today's high
tech. The cutting edge has been burnished. The soft tech of today
parts ways with the industrial look of the late 1970s in its
refined sense of workmanship and appreciation for texture. The
rawness has disappeared; so has the urge to be confrontational.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago this fall, ``High Tech: The Industrial Style
and Source Book for the Home'' (Clarkson N. Potter) by Joan Kron
and Suzanne Slesin (both former staff members at The New York
Times), was published amid a mood of generational derring-do and
nose-thumbing irreverance. Gym lockers as bedroom closets, Con
Edison guard gates as towel racks, and test-tube vases : the book
was rife with unheard-of ideas for taking industrial equipment
straight out of the factory and installing it in the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty shocking to the mainstream consumer at the
time,'' Ms. Kron recalled. ``You have to remember that they were
used to living with reproduction French Provencal paneling.''
</P>
<P>
   High tech wasn't invented in the 1970s, of course. Domesticating
the machine esthetic began at the very beginning of the modern
movement with Le Corbusier's famed manifestos and Pierre Chareau's
poetic Maison de Verre in Paris in the 1930s. But it was a
liberating movement: design that was affordable, ready-made and
maintenance-free, as well as status-free. It was the dawning of the
age of the urban loft.
</P>
<P>
   ``High Tech,'' the book, went out of print more than 10 years
ago, having sold some 67,000 copies. Many of the images on its
pages _ Studio Morsa's loft bunk bed made out of scaffolding; Paul
Rudolph's living room furnished entirely in tractor tires covered
with white elastic _ look more laughable than livable, more akin to
Woody Allen's ``orgasmatron'' in ``Sleepers'' than Le Corbusier's
machine for living.
</P>
<P>
   But as an esthetic that keeps evolving and refining itself in
such projects as the Brooklyn town house Freya Block and Margaret
Leahy designed with the copper-mesh wall, the spirit of high tech
has only flourished with the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an interpretation and catalyst for enriching the modern
esthetic, the high-tech movement never reached a dead end,'' said
architect Charles Gwathmey, whose curving glass-block wall made a
cameo appearance in the Kron and Slesin book. ``It just keeps
getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   And by now, the lessons of high tech have been so internalized
that when Ms. Block wanted an interesting material for the kitchen
windows she had to go no further than Jack Lenor Larson, the
established textile designer, to find the stiff-bodied gossamer
fabric with a metallic sheen that had been adapted from
fire-fighting equipment.
</P>
<P>
   It's a far cry from the late 1970s, when people in New York who
wanted a professional stove in their apartments had to fight their
contractors as well as their co-op boards, who said it couldn't,
shouldn't be done. Now, every kitchen supplier offers a home
version of the commercial stove.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Block and Ms. Leahy, who met while teaching at Pratt
Institute, were hired _ along with Brent Porter, an architect who
helped with the technical systems _ to renovate a landmarked
Brooklyn town house, they weren't conscious of trying to achieve
any one look. And their clients, an investment banker and his wife,
a teacher, were game to try just about anything as long as it was
beautifully executed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a bold use of materials seldom, if ever, associated with
a stately brownstone, the interiors the designers created possess a
subtle glamour: high-voltage light fixtures and handmade furniture,
hand-nailed floors and the latest Italian divan cohabit
companionably. Even the most industrial of materials are treated
with craftsmanlike care.
</P>
<P>
   To conceal a wet bar and wine collection in the dining room,
they installed an electronic metal-mesh overhead door _ you see its
cousin every day, cranking down over shop windows at closing time _
but they had it custom-fitted and the motor tested to make sure
that its hum would be almost inconspicuous. When the
semi-transparent grate is closed and lighted from within, it glows
like a lantern or, better, a steel veil.
</P>
<P>
   In front of it stands a glass-and-concrete counter, a piece of
functional sculpture by Rolf Petchukas, a Cape Cod artist. ``No
matter whether you use something high tech or handmade,'' Ms. Block
said, ``you want to make people aware of materials as something to
be touched and appreciated for their human scale and warmth.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the designers limited their palette to neutral colors
(except for a Cassina lime-green and purplish-blue Torso armchair),
they didn't restrict their range of metals and materials. The
copper leifmotif weaves through the entire house, from the entry
hall to the amber-colored glass tiles that surround an upstairs
fireplace to the bronze-toned paint used on the ornate
plaster-relief kitchen ceiling (which was meticulously cleaned and
repaired with dental tools). Even the radiators are sheathed in
copper-mesh covers.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the aluminum that turns up as wainscoting in a
downstairs bathroom; as sheathing for several powder-room sinks
and, no surprise, as the requisite material for all the custom-made
kitchen cabinets, which, like garage doors, open upward, not to the
side. At one point, Ms. Block even toyed with the idea of lining
the closets with aluminum. ``But we knew when not to go over the
top,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the designers were free to experiment _ sometimes to
startling effect. In counterpoint to metallic sheen, they
selectively deployed a colored plaster, applied heavily enough to
masquerade as concrete. Created by Vesna Bricelj, a Manhattan
artist, it covers the wall by the front door, its large swirls
revealing the motion of the hand _ quite an opening statement for a
belle epoque town house.
</P>
<P>
   In the master bedroom, the same heavy plaster, tinted with soft
reds and oranges, is applied as a frieze, lighted from below. The
effect is one of a perpetual sunrise or sunset. In another
bathroom, blue-gray slate floor tile _ think of it as a
sophisticated take on hoary stone _ creates the ``cave dwelling''
atmosphere the clients requested.
</P>
<P>
   The freedom to take a material, an object, a technique out of
context and rework it in a new way is the essential legacy of the
high-tech movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It created the chance to break away from the matching-fabric
school of decorating,'' said Vicente Wolf, whose work was featured
prominently in ``High Tech,'' and who still appreciates the
industrial esthetic as a source of new ideas. ``High tech was the
moment when we really started to think and create like designers,''
he said. ``And we haven't stopped thinking.''

DANE CLARK, 85, ACTOR WHO STARRED IN WORLD WAR II FILMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dane Clark, the Brooklyn-born actor whose down-to-earth
portrayals of tough but appealing soldiers, sailors and pilots in
World War II films for Warner Brothers brought him stardom, died
Sept. 11 at St. John's Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif. He was
85 and lived in Brentwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the best break of my life, hooking up with the
Warners,'' Clark said in a 1946 interview. ``They don't go much for
the `pretty boy' type there. An average-looking guy like me has a
chance to get someplace, to portray people the way they really are,
without any frills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I want to do in films is to be Joe Average as
well as I know how. Of course, anyone whose face appears often
enough on the screen is bound to have bobby-soxers after him for
autographs. But what I really get a kick out of is when cab drivers
around New York lean out and yell ``Hi, Brooklyn' when I walk by.
They make me feel I'm putting it across OK when I try to be Joe
Average.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark made some 30 films, beginning with ``Sunday Punch'' in
1942 and ending with ``Last Rites'' in 1988. But he also appeared
on Broadway and on the road in a variety of stage roles and
performed frequently on television. But he never became as big a
star as his friend John Garfield, who suggested he take up acting,
or Humphrey Bogart, who, he said, gave him the name Dane Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's early credits were under his real name, Bernard
Zanville, and it was under that name in the role of a sailor named
Johnnie Pulaski that he caught the attention of the critics in the
1943 Warners Brothers feature ``Action in the North Atlantic,''
which paid tribute to the heroism of the merchant marine.
</P>
<P>
   As Bernard Zanville, he appeared in films like ``The Glass
Key,'' ``Wake Island'' and ``The Pride of the Yankees'' in 1942,
and as Dane Clark he portrayed a sailor aboard a submarine in
``Destination Tokyo'' in 1944, a flier in ``God Is My Co-Pilot'' in
1945 and a leatherneck in ``Pride of the Marines'' that same year.
</P>
<P>
   Among his other films were ``Hollywood Canteen'' (1944), ``A
Stolen Life'' (1946), ``Whiplash'' (1948), ``Fort Defiance''
(1951), ``Never Trust a Gambler'' (1951) and ``Outlaw's Son''
(1957). His co-stars were people like Bogart, Garfield, Cary Grant,
Bette Davis and Raymond Massey.
</P>
<P>
   Clark was especially proud of the 1954 film ``Go Man Go!,'' in
which he played Abe Saperstein, the founder of the trailblazing
black basketball team the Harlem Globetrotters, because he regarded
the film as a forerunner of others that decried racial
discrimination and championed civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who was born in Brooklyn on Feb. 18, 1913, was a product
of the Great Depression. As a graduate of Cornell University and
St. John's Law School in Brooklyn in the mid-1930's, he said, he
found that lawyers were having as hard a time as anyone else
finding work. He drifted into boxing. At 5 foot 10, weighing 162
pounds, the hazel-eyed, brown-haired Clark soon concluded that he
was outmatched and saw no sense in taking beatings. To earn a
dollar, he said, he played baseball, labored at construction,
worked as a salesman and then, as a sculptor's model, fell in with
what he called an arty set.
</P>
<P>
   ``They fascinated me at first,'' he said. ``Then suddenly it
struck me that their constant snobbish talk about the `theatah' was
a little on the phony side. I decided it give it a try myself, just
to show them anyone could do it. Before I knew it, I was getting
small parts on Broadway, then bigger ones. Then finally I got some
good spots in `Dead End'' and `Stage Door' and finally took over
the lead from Wally Ford in `Of Mice and Men.''' Before long, Clark
decided to try his luck in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's first wife, Margot Yoder, a painter and sculptor, died
in 1970. He is survived by his wife of 27 years, Geraldine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very complex, wondrous business I'm in,'' Clark once
said as he reminisced. ``My kicks are my work. I'm miserable when
I'm not working.''

TRYING OUT SOME USB PERIPHERALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHAEL DESMOND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To see how the Universal Serial Bus worked, I pulled together
some USB peripherals and plugged them into my 300 MHz Pentium II
system, a Dell Dimension XPS D300 running Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   The three devices were the Storm Technologies PageScan USB
scanner, the Kodak DVC260 digital camera and the Polaroid ColorShot
photo printer. All three are terrific candidates for USB, since
these types of products typically force users to share ports,
resulting in juggling how many and which devices can be used.
</P>
<P>
   The PageScan USB was already installed on my system, and
continued to work faithfully throughout these tests.
</P>
<P>
   My first, and rockiest, stop was with the Kodak DVC260. This
gray-and-black camera takes absolutely stunning pictures, with
resolution about four times greater than that of earlier models.
After snapping a few pictures, I installed the Kodak software,
plugged the camera into a USB port, and turned it on. Windows 98
got a whiff of the new hardware, loaded drivers and promptly failed
to make a connection.
</P>
<P>
   Puzzled, I turned the camera off and on again, and this time it
worked. In Windows Explorer, the DVC260 acted like just another
disk drive. I could immediately view the contents of the camera's
digital memory and drag them over to a directory on my hard disk.
</P>
<P>
   However, when I tried to drag more than two files, the transfer
froze, forcing me to restart Explorer. Dragging one file at a time
resolved the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Transfers were blisteringly fast compared to older camera
connections, with 500KB images taking about 5 seconds to transfer.
Once images landed on my local drive, I could work with them in any
application I chose.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid's ColorShot made for an easy installation. This little
printer is about the size of a paperback book and outputs photos on
Polaroid instant film stock.
</P>
<P>
   I plugged the printer into the USB port and Windows 98 soon
popped up a dialog box telling me it had found a ColorShot printer.
I installed the driver software from the included CD-ROM, restarted
the PC, and the ColorShot appeared in the list of devices in
Windows 98's Printer window.
</P>
<P>
   The output looked identical to a Polaroid snapshot. No pixel
dots, smeared ink, or flimsy paper. The printer works by applying
heat to the film media, producing photo-quality results.
</P>
<P>
   But the images appeared washed out. Printouts over the USB wire
were quick: full-color ones were produced within 15 seconds.

Randy Moss, taken much later in the first round, is quickly

MODERN'S SUAVE NEW MANNER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Design is serious. Decoration is superficial. Ask
them.
</P>
<P>
   In the 20th century, modern design and interior decoration have
never had much use for each other.
</P>
<P>
   Design is a science _ a hard body of facts. It is technology,
like engineering and architecture. It has purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Interior decoration is fashion _ an art when it prays hard. It
knows how to stop a room when it walks in.
</P>
<P>
   But modern design and decorator taste have been showing up
together lately _ and they make a great-looking couple.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Vaughn, 33, a New York architect, brought the soft touch
of decoration to the hard edge of modern design and put them both
to work in the renovation of an apartment on the Upper East Side,
balancing one neatly with the other.
</P>
<P>
   The client, Hiram Williams, had a superb collection of
contemporary furniture _ acrylics, glass and chrome _ designed by
Baron Alessandro Albrizzi in the 1960s and '70s. To that, Vaughn
brought his background in traditional decoration: He worked for
Parish-Hadley, the august American company, until May.
Unexpectedly, he gave the two disciplines equal rights in the same
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my great love is mixing furniture, composing things,''
Vaughan said. ``I love modern furniture, I love traditional
furniture, when they're appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   He's a man after Albrizzi's own heart. A Venetian with a
16th-century palazzo on the Grand Canal in Venice, Italy, the baron
founded Albrizzi Inc. in 1965, the year Vaughn was born. Then 30,
the baron was a member of an international aristocratic set that
moved among Venice, Rome, London and Palm Beach, Fla., where he
opened offices.
</P>
<P>
   Albrizzi Inc.'s New York shop, at the Carlyle Hotel, sold the
trademark home furnishings _ tables, desks, stacking cubes and
accessories like candlesticks and backgammon sets _ that became
synonymous with forward-thinking interior decoration. ``Albrizzi,''
declared Vogue magazine in 1970, ``is where chic people of all ages
seem to find the very thing for their own or friends' houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn discovered several of the designs in the basement of
Williams' house in Water Mill. Williams was the companion of
Albrizzi, who died at 59 in 1994. Vaughn and Williams have revived
Albrizzi Inc., reproducing a selection of items, some newly
interpreted, that became available this week through Hinson &AMP; Co.
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn made the originals the focus of his renovation of
Williams' apartment. But to keep Albrizzi's sleek designs from
looking like a modern museum installation, he deployed them with
the elements of traditional decoration.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn had help from the Albrizzi furniture: clean, versatile
shapes with the exuberance of modern materials like chrome and
acrylic and the unexpected precision of craft. The plastics were
hand beveled, fused and polished, not molded. Like the designer
himself, they were socially deft. And they were novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was intended to freshen an environment that had many
different types of furniture in it, as a sophisticated compliment
to great pieces,'' Vaughn said of Albrizzi design. ``What sold me
on it was the way it fit in. I stuck it next to a French chair, I
stuck it next to a sofa with pillows, and it fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's experience is worth examining at this particular
moment, with the escalating enthusiasm for midcentury modern
design. A young generation of admirers has come to it through
magazines like Wallpaper, fashion advertising, downtown-minded
design stores and upscale catalogs like Garnet Hill, adopting it as
a kind of uniform for the home.
</P>
<P>
   The flaw is that, unaccompanied by the context of history,
nothing looks new. Modern design loses its daring alone. In the
right crowd, it turns heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I feel I'm going overboard on one look, I try to balance
it, bring it down to earth, make it a little less flashy,'' Vaughn
said. He used three traditional, upholstered sofas _ not flat,
modern-design-statement sofas _ to ground the jet-age flights of
fancy among the Albrizzi pieces in the living room. Vaughn's system
of reciprocated restraint included texture and color, in addition
to furniture placement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard and shiny was obviously on my mind,'' he said. ``I wanted
to counterbalance slick surfaces with textured surfaces.'' Vaughn
used a subtle, animal-fur-like Rose Cummings pattern on the largest
sofa, specifically chosen to go with a bright red floating acrylic
coffee table designed by Albrizzi.
</P>
<P>
   On the chocolate brown, semigloss wall behind the sofa, Vaughn
hung a pair of carved, raw wood doors from the 1940s, found in the
south of France, as a kind of clever comment on sculptural wall
ornaments that became popular in the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have a shiny paint surface, I like some textural wood,''
he explained. The brown wall color was chosen to showcase two
acrylic lamps with red accents, inspired by Albrizzi and designed
by Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   At the opposite end of the room, two smaller sofas with
traditionally tubby, rolled arms and upholstered in a soft chenille
flank a blunt, mirrored fireplace and a chrome and glass Albrizzi
table. The wall behind is paneled in natural raffia, as a backdrop
to a gallery grouping of Venetian landscape paintings by Roger de
Montbello.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An architect by training, Vaughn considers himself a problem
solver, not a taste-maker.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest problem in the apartment was an awkward public
space. He removed a room partition between the living and dining
rooms, replacing it with a clever ghost: floor-to-ceiling mirrors
with sconces that suggest an enfiladelike inversion of the original
partition.
</P>
<P>
   Left with a large double room, Vaughn wisely avoided abstract,
loftlike isolations of furniture. Instead, he created useful,
conversation-piece seating groups, each with a central interest _ a
piece of Albrizzi design. Shapes that can be approached from all
sides, like an octagonal, lacquered wood Albrizzi card table with a
leather inset top, help the space to circulate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's thoughtful juxtapositions,'' Vaughn said of his work.
``In a traditional New York apartment, I wasn't trying to deviate
from what would be a very traditional plan.'' He added, ``The
shapes and the textures and the colors give the apartment what it's
got.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn constructed a dining alcove from a maid's room next to
the kitchen. He designed a black paneled moving wall that
segregates it intimately for small suppers or opens it for dinner
parties. An Albrizzi chrome and glass table holds center court.
</P>
<P>
   To give guests something to talk about, Vaughn put a celebrity
at the table: a black patent-leather Louis XVI-style banquette. He
found it at a consignment shop in Southampton. ``To me, this says
the '50s,'' Vaughn said. ``It's not the modernist '50s; it's the
high-glamour Dior '50s.''
</P>
<P>
   It's definitely adult. In new, worldlier company, modern design
has begun to mature. Older is often wiser.

THE BOARDWALK BREEZE AND MISS AMERICA, TOO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. _ Most people who visit Atlantic City do it
for the slot machines and blackjack tables, or maybe to see the
big-name entertainers who work the casino/hotel circuit. In
September, of course, some are there to root for their home state's
contestant in the annual Miss America Pageant.
</P>
<P>
   Me? I don't wager on anything that doesn't eat a bucket of oats
for breakfast, and I've seen enough Miss America Pageants to hold
me spellbound well into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   No, I came for the cool, pre-autumn breezes that waft across the
Boardwalk from the Atlantic Ocean. I came for respite from a 1998
Texas summer that seemed to begin sometime around Valentine's Day
and was still going strong when I fled the Lone Star State last
week.
</P>
<P>
   I know. The question is unavoidable: What kind of a nitwit would
drive nearly 2,000 miles through nine states _ I took the
Midwestern scenic route _ just to cool off?
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's perfect.
</P>
<P>
   And darn the luck. No sooner do I arrive than the South Jersey
Shore is hit with a rare September heat wave. The ocean breeze is
wet, but it isn't cool.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``steam bath'' comes to mind.
</P>
<P>
   Time out. In the spirit of confession and candor being
promulgated _ sort of _ by the president of the United States, I
might as well come clean about my motives for journeying to Jersey.
A fervent yearning for brisk Boardwalk nights was a factor, to be
sure, but I'm also here to watch Miss Texas Tatum Hubbard earn the
much-coveted title of Miss America. It's been nearly a
quarter-century since Miss Texas last claimed the national crown;
it's time to get the contest back on track.
</P>
<P>
   And Hubbard is just the woman who can do it. She's everything
that the Miss America honchos say they are looking for:
intelligent, articulate, involved in the community.
</P>
<P>
   She could get by on beauty, talent and personality _ time was,
those qualities defined the competition _ but she doesn't have to.
Watch for her on the pageant telecast Saturday night; she'll be the
one wearing the crown at the end of the show.
</P>
<P>
   Miss America still packs a punch in the TV ratings, which means
that lots of people watch the pageant, which means that it's a big
deal. Hubbard and 50 other contestants in the pageant will be
competing for scholarships ranging from $500 to $40,000 _ which
also makes it a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   Some people don't like the pageant, don't approve of what they
think it stands for, but that doesn't keep it from being a big
deal. Whether it will remain a big deal, whether the whole idea of
pageantry can sustain itself in a changing world, is another
question.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Horn, who is retiring after 11 years as head of the Miss
America Organization, has been bragging about the many changes that
have made the pageant program more relevant to contemporary women
and contemporary society.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime pageant aficionados will tell you that not all the
changes have been for the best. There is no shortage of people who
liked the competition much better when it was mostly about beauty
and personality and snazzy dresses; everybody knew how to prepare
for that kind of a contest.
</P>
<P>
   There was a reason why states such as Texas and Mississippi used
to dominate the Miss America Pageant. They figured out what the
judges were looking for _ and they figured out how to deliver it.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, it's not so easy _ although Horn made it sound simple
enough during a news conference this week to introduce his
successor as president and CEO of the Miss America Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Miss America in the 1990s and beyond, Horn said, must be a
``socially motivated activist'' as opposed to the ``passive beauty
queen'' of times past.
</P>
<P>
   I could name some dynamic and socially motivated ex-Miss
Americas who would surely take exception to being dismissed as
passive beauty queens, but Horn's point was a valid one. Women look
at the world differently now than they did in the '40s and '50s; if
she is to survive, Miss America must change her outlook as well.

IN TORONTO, FILMS LOUNGING ON THE DARK SIDE OF HUMANITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Drugs. Violence. Pedophilia. Dysfunctional families.
And murder. Plenty of murder.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Toronto Film Festival, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The sprawling nine-day festival, which ends on Saturday,
includes 311 films from 53 countries, with a large contingent from
Canada and Japan. There are comedies, romances, historical dramas
and film dealing with political and social issues.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the most high-profile films from the United States,
whose directors seem to have seen ``Pulp Fiction'' and ``Fargo''
too many times, are intensely and jokingly violent or involve
families twisted by pathology.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something in the Zeitgeist now,'' said Christine
Vachon, one of New York's top independent producers. ``A lot of
scripts I get have these very dark themes, a cornucopia of
dysfunction. You know, `Jane is a 13-year-old anorexic who lives
with her parents and has been raped by her father.' And this is a
comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vachon is a producer of ``Happiness,'' probably the most
discussed film at the festival. It is a corrosive drama, with
plenty of black comedy, about three grown-up New Jersey sisters,
their parents, mates, children and neighbors. The most shocking
element of the film is a pedophiliac father, a psychiatrist, who
seduces young boys.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which cost about $3 million, was financed by October
Films, a division of Universal, which is owned by Seagram. But
after viewing it, executives at Universal asked October not to
release the film. ``Happiness'' is now being released by Good
Machine, a New York production company.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Solondz, the 38-year-old director of ``Happiness,'' whose
previous film was ``Welcome to the Dollhouse,'' a disturbing
portrait of an unhappy young girl in suburbia, said that formerly
taboo subjects were now common to the culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people may look at `Happiness' and say: `Oh, what a joke.
It's cool,''' said Solondz. ``Well, that's not my point. This is
like the nightmare we live. What's taboo anymore? Look at
television. Look at the newspapers. Murder or incest or pedophilia
or serial this or serial that. This is where we are. This is a
reflection. I don't believe films are paving the way or inventing a
new way of looking at things. They're very much a response to _ or
reflective of _ where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, John Sloss, a New York lawyer who represents many
independent filmmakers, said the spate of very dark movies mirrored
the blunt commercial ambitions of young directors and writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the film community there is an increasing pressure to
become edgier and edgier, to sort of separate yourself from the
pack and to shock,'' he said. ``There may be a form of
one-upsmanship going on, you know, `Let's find a new genre of human
depravity.' ''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Sloss echoed the views of others and said
these films could be an unconscious reaction to the nation's
prosperity in recent years. ``The reaction to this complacency
could be reflected in a broader discontent with larger issues,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The bleak films shown at the festival range from serious ones,
like ``Happiness,'' to the imitative ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had films like `Fargo' and `Pulp Fiction': those are the
happy parents,'' said Russell Schwartz, president of Gramercy
Pictures, which released ``Fargo.'' ``Now you have the clones, the
errant offspring.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the American films at the festival are to be released in
the next few months; others are seeking distributors. Among the
more grisly soon-to-be released films at the festival are ``Very
Bad Things,'' about a bachelor party in Las Vegas that turns
vicious, and ``Clay Pigeons,'' involving a fictional Montana town
populated with corrosive characters.
</P>
<P>
   Several other dark films seemed to stir far more interest. These
included ``Apt Pupil,'' a drama directed by Bryan Singer and
adapted from a Stephen King novella. It is about a seemingly normal
all-American 16-year-old played by Brad Renfro, whose obsession
with the Holocaust leads to the discovery of a Nazi war criminal
(played by Ian McKellen) living in his town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Combining this bright, contemporary youth in an urban setting
with one of the greatest evils in history fascinated me,'' said
Singer, who previously directed ``The Usual Suspects.''
</P>
<P>
   Another film, ``A Simple Plan,'' directed by Sam Raimi, based on
the novel by Scott B. Smith, stars Billy Bob Thornton and Bill
Paxton, among others, and deals with two brothers and a friend who
unearth a downed plane and find a body and $4.5 million. Greed and
death ensue.
</P>
<P>
   A third provocative film, awaiting a distributor, is ``Broken
Vessels,'' directed by Scott Ziehl, an exploration of the
relatively unknown world of Los Angeles ambulance drivers. As
depicted in the movie, that world is shrouded by violence, danger,
drugs and crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these films and others are dealing with exactly the same
idea: the notion that surface reality is one thing but beneath that
is a seething mass of moral compromise, jealousy and betrayal,''
said Piers Handling, the film festival's director and a Canadian
author and academic. ``What's even more disturbing than the drug
films are all of these dysfunctional families. These are very dark
comedies that deal with the hypocrisy of a culture.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In fact, one of the few smaller films to be bought for
distribution at the festival is the Tod Williams comedy-drama ``The
Adventures of Sebastian Cole,'' about a family in upstate New York
whose stepfather has just announced that he wants a sex-change
operation. (The mother wants to return to England to start drinking
again.) The film was bought by Paramount Classics, a new division
of Paramount.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast with these films, the one movie that briefly seized
the attention of the festival _ and virtually every studio
distributor in town _ was a new Bernardo Bertolucci romance,
``Besieged'' (initially called ``The Siege'').
</P>
<P>
   The film, which opened at a packed theater the other night,
deals with the relationship between an African housekeeper (Thandie
Newton) and a wealthy, eccentric music teacher (David Thewlis) who
lives in a palatial Roman home. Although the film received a
standing ovation, several top distributors shied away from it and
said privately that they found it tedious.
</P>
<P>
   Greeted with more enthusiasm were films like ``The Powder Keg,''
a powerful account of a group of people caught up in the brutal
realities of Belgrade in 1995. The film was made by the veteran
Serbian director Goran Paskaljevic.
</P>
<P>
   Another acclaimed foreign film was Thomas Vinterberg's
``Celebration,'' a black comedy about a patriarch's 60th birthday
and a disastrous weekend in which yet another dysfunctional
family's secrets (Danish style) are unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   A third foreign film welcomed enthusiastically was Tom Tykwer's
``Run Lola Run,'' an inventive and kinetic German comedy about a
woman who has 20 minutes to come up with cash to save her
boyfriend, who has lost the money of his shady boss.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was the darker American films _ some successful, some not
_ that seized the attention of many filmgoers here. Harvey
Weinstein, co-chairman of Miramax, whose films here included
Roberto Benigni's ``Life Is Beautiful,'' a gentle and haunting
drama set in a concentration camp, said he did not fully understand
why there were so many ultraviolent and dysfunctional-family
movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a year ago, it seemed to be optimistic,'' Weinstein said.
``What's in the air? There's this new freedom to explore dangerous
subject matters. People are trying to top themselves. They're
asking: `What's next? What's new? How far can you widen the
envelope? How far are we really going to go?' '' &QL;

STARR REPORT NOT QUITE A BESTSELLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE COSTANTINOU  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Quicker than a tryst in a certain White House
hallway, the book publishing world has put out paperback versions
of the official Bill and Monica Story.
</P>
<P>
   The paperback version of ``The Starr Report'' were already on
bookstore shelves by Tuesday morning, four days after the 445-page
document was made public on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Three publishers have rushed to the shelves with their own
editions, and more versions are on the way, reminding bookstore
employees of the book blitz that followed such celebrity news
events as the O.J. saga and the death of Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
   No book these days is worth a blurb without a movie adaptation.
If some members of Congress have their way, the videotape of
President Clinton's Aug. 17 appearance before a federal grand jury
may soon be in a video store near you.
</P>
<P>
   But bibliophiles, voyeurs, news junkies and Clinton-bashers were
not exactly lining up around the block to buy the books _ priced at
$5.95 by Pocket Books, or $10 for either the Washington Post's
version published by HarperCollins, or the ``official, unedited and
complete'' version by Prima, a publishing house based in Rocklin,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the report by Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth
Starr had already been on the Internet and in many newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the appearance of the books didn't cause a stampede,
it still amazed some people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God, I don't believe it,'' said Tara Roth, 26, a
business student, discovering the books on a counter at a Borders
in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand it coming out so soon on the Internet,'' she
added. ``I can understand it in the newspapers. But you don't
expect a book to be published overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Borders was ready for bonanza sales, just in case. Tuesday
morning, minutes after the store opened, a UPS truck arrived with
more than 150 boxes containing nearly 1,600 books, said Matthew
Belson, a shipping clerk.
</P>
<P>
   Although someone joked that the books should be shelved in the
erotica section, Belson said, it was decided to stack them at the
registers, near other hot sellers like the Zagat restaurant guides
and a basket of knitted finger puppets.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, video shops were wondering whether a tape of
Clinton's grand jury testimony would soon be on their shelves.
</P>
<P>
   At one San Francisco-area video store, there already was an
answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably won't be carrying it,'' said Teresa Weeks, 25, a
clerk at Video Wave. ``We pride ourselves on having quality. We
don't try to sell scandal.''

A MOTHER'S LOVE ISN'T AUTOMATIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maternal instinct. Wherever does it come from? You certainly
can't drink it from a long-neck bottle. You can't rub it into your
skin like a facial cream. You can't inhale it or swallow it in
capsule form. Despite all of our modern scientific advances, we've
yet to come up with a formula that can make a mother love her
children.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, we need one.
</P>
<P>
   We are all too familiar with the horrific stories of innocent
children neglected, abandoned, abused and even killed by the very
person who gave birth to them. It is appalling but true that not
every mother demonstrates ``agape'' love for her offspring. That is
the kind of love that knows no bounds and defies reason.
</P>
<P>
   It is the love that brings tears to the eyes of a serial
killer's mother as she watches his execution. It is the love that
makes a mother refuse to give up on a child found to have autism or
Down syndrome. It is the love that says, ``I know the doctor saw
him two days ago and his ears looked normal, but I'm sure my baby
has an ear infection. I want him examined again.'' You know, that
kind of love. That kind of instinct.
</P>
<P>
   My first son was a difficult delivery, but when he finally
appeared _ so precious, so beautiful, so helpless _ I was torn with
conflicting emotions. On the one hand, it was love at first sight.
Even with his wrinkled body and puffy face, I knew he was something
special. My first comments were, ``Oh, he's so beautiful,'' then,
``Can we do something about his head? It looks like a waffle
cone.''
</P>
<P>
   In the hospital, the nurses taught me the basics of child care:
feeding, diaper changes, burping, but I still had so many
questions. When we arrived home, it was more than a great relief to
have my mother greet us at the door. The week that she spent with
us was delightful. I begged her to stay longer, but she had to get
back to her job.
</P>
<P>
   At the airport, everyone was crying. My mother was crying
because she hated to leave her firstborn grandbaby. I was crying
because I had no idea what to do with this totally dependent baby
boy who was staring at me somewhat skeptically. I don't know why my
husband's eyes were watery, but I think it had something to do with
my mother's special-recipe sweet potato pie.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, everything went wrong. The baby got a diaper rash
and started spitting up his formula after every bottle. He caught a
cold. He slept all day and cried all night. He seemed so unhappy
that I felt like a failure as a mother. I called the pediatricians
so often that they knew my voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, Mrs. Anderson, what is it now? Yes, it's normal for
babies to hiccup in sets of three. I'm sure it not an omen. He'll
be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, by the time No. 2 came along a few years later, I
started to get the hang of motherhood. My husband was awed by the
things that I could deduce from a few coos through the baby
monitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey, it's your turn. He's rolled over onto his back and he
can't find his pacifier. It's in the northwest corner of his crib
under the blanket. He's not wet, but he'd like to hear some music.
Give him his pacifier, put him on his stomach and tune the radio to
that classical music station. He'll go right back to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   The days become years, and words become sentences. There's
nothing legal that most mothers and fathers would not do for the
benefit of their children. If only we all felt that way. I thought
maternal instinct came with the baby. Obviously, it doesn't.

 &HT;    BATTLE OVER ROYALTIES FOR BAR MUSIC HEATS UP
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (e) entertainment categories.
 &HT;    BY NICHOLE MONROE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Congress only weeks from adjourning for the
year, both friends and enemies of the Fairness in Music Licensing
bill are pressing legislators to rapidly reach a decision on
whether restaurants and other small businesses should be exempt
from paying license fees for background music.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar-winning songwriter Marilyn Bergman said Wednesday that the
bill, which passed the House easily and is now under review by the
Senate Judiciary Committee, would deny artists a living from the
royalties they receive from their songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might say that we creators are the victims of our own
successes,'' Bergman, president and chairwoman of the American
Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, said in a National
Press Club speech. ``Our music is everywhere. It stitches together
our daily lives. Through mass media, it is in the air, but it
mustn't be free as air.''
</P>
<P>
   Bergman and her husband, Alan, have enjoyed great artistic
recognition and commercial success for songs such as ``The
Windmills of Your Mind'' and ``The Way We Were.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, the vast majority of the association's 75,000
members earn less than $5,000 a year for their words and music.
Unlike singers, songwriters can't rely on compact disk sales or
concert tour revenue for income, Bergman said.
</P>
<P>
   Christina Howard, a spokeswoman for the National Restaurant
Association, said ``nothing could be further from the truth'' than
the idea that the the licensing bill would cost songwriters a
fortune in royalties. Already, songwriters often receive several
sets of royalties from just one broadcast of a song, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would exempt bars, restaurants and taverns from paying
license fees, as they now must, to songwriters, composers and
publishers for copyrighted music played on radio and TV in their
places of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a sports bar where people come into the bar to watch the
game, they're not there to listen to the music,'' Howard said. ``If
the music happens to come on in a jingle or a commercial, the bar
shouldn't have to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Introduced by Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., the Fairness in
Music Licensing Act was added as an amendment to the Copyright Term
Extension bill, which would extend the length of U.S. copyright
from an authors' life plus 50 years to 70 years. Supporters also
favor the bill because it would allow business owners to dispute
copyright infringement claims on a local level rather than having
to travel to the sole court in New York.

 &HT;    IN WORST NATURAL DISASTER SINCE '85 QUAKE, MEXICO STRUGGLES WITH
FLOODS
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Nearly half a million people have been cut off by
a week's worth of severe flooding in southern Mexico, where
survivors and rescue workers are grappling with the specter of
hunger and disease.
</P>
<P>
   The latest death toll cited in press reports of Mexican
government documents exceeds 400, although Catholic Church
officials in southern Chiapas state fear that as many as 1,000 have
perished due to landslides and swollen rivers that washed away
entire villages.
</P>
<P>
   The last official death count based on bodies found was 90. But
government officials from President Ernesto Zedillo on down
acknowledge that many more victims may be buried under mud or
washed out to the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo, who has made three trips to Chiapas state since
flooding began, said the calamity may be the worst natural disaster
to hit Mexico since the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, which killed
10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loss of life can't be calculated yet,'' said Jesus Sanchez
an editor at the newspaper El Orbe in Tapachula, a city near the
Guatemalan border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entire communities have been swallowed by mud, and there are
communities where stranded people are only now being reached by
helicopters,'' said Sanchez, who spoke by telephone on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar Mejia, a Red Cross coordinator who also spoke by telephone
from Tapachula, said, ``The situation is difficult because there is
water, water everywhere. And we can't even get to some villages to
get them the help we have available.''
</P>
<P>
   One helicopter, Mejia said, made 36 air deliveries on Tuesday,
delivering about 300 kilos of food and supplies. ``And we only
covered a small fraction of the affected area,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Radio stations have reported sporadic complaints that local
officials from Mexico's dominant Revolutionary Institutional Party
were hoarding relief supplies or refusing to release it to
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials at the scene have dismissed such charges, and
Zedillo has publicly demanded that aid be distributed fairly.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few months ago, Chiapas state was parched by drought and
struggling to contain forest fires that unleashed plumes of smoke
that reached north into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Now the state, particularly rural low-lying areas along the
Pacific Ocean and the Guatemalan border, are coping with the impact
of unusually savage rains. The highland area and eastern jungles of
Chiapas where Zapatista rebels are based have not been affected by
the flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue missions and attempts to distribute water and food to a
string of Pacific Coast towns and villages are underway, utilizing
65 helicopters and thousands of Mexican troops. It is an effort
that is ``unprecedented in our history,'' according to Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   Still, hunger is sending waves of panic through towns being
served by the military and the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexico City newspaper Reforma reported that a military
helicopter was surrounded by people who fought over food supplies
in the town of El Soconusco, 40 miles northwest of Tapachula.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers fought over cans of sardines, flour and crackers, the
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are starving to death here,'' Reforma quoted Leobardo
Broca, a village leader as saying while he tried to calm a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the hunger problem, Red Cross officials are trying to
fight outbreaks of intestinal and respiratory infections among
villagers, as well as feet infections caused by contaminated water
and mud.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez said people in Chiapas fear disease that could be spread
by mud where bodies are trapped.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that farmers in the southern part of Chiapas, which
is one of Mexico's poorest states, will need emergency aid to cope
with the loss of their coffee and corn crops as well as houses and
other property.
</P>
<P>
   In response to calls for donations, Pope John Paul II has
donated $50,000 to flood relief in Chiapas.

GAY THEMES DRAGGING ANCHOR IN `WATER'
</HEADLINE>
 THE WATER-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems as if we've been surrounded by upbeat, viewer-friendly
gay romantic comedies. Pictures like ``Kiss Me Guido,'' ``I Think I
Do'' and ``Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss'' have been welcome
respites from the more melancholy, self-pitying efforts of the
early-'90s gay independent cinema movement.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Dallas-based filmmaker Kelli Herd's new picture,
``It's in the Water,'' comes off as somewhat of a disappointment.
Lacking the wit and the comedic pacing of its recent predecessors,
as well as the dramatic tension of earlier efforts, ``Water'' dries
up rather quickly by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   The setting is the fictional Southern town of Azalea Springs
(presumably in Texas, as the production was based in and around the
Dallas area). The locals get in a tizzy when a rumor begins
spreading that the town water supply is making residents gay.
</P>
<P>
   It's nonsense, of course, spread by resident fey gadfly Spencer
(John Hallum) after one too many cocktails at a town society
function. That doesn't stop residents from stocking up on bottled
water, egged on by the hysterical stories in the local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the stories are contested by the publisher's own
son, Mark (Derrick Sanders), himself a thinly veiled closet case.
Meanwhile, another debate rages over the opening of an AIDS
hospice, the Hope House, next door to the local church. Alex
Stratton (Keri Jo Chapman) is our hero, an attractive, no-nonsense
Junior Leaguer who takes a liking to her volunteer work at the
hospice, much to the distaste of her image-conscious, acid-tongued
mother (Barbara Lasater) and her snooty best friend, Sloan (Nancy
Chartier).
</P>
<P>
   But her newfound infatuation with volunteer work comes largely
when she finds that an old school chum is on staff. Grace (Teresa
Garrett) is back in town after surviving an abusive marriage, and
her presence awakens Alex to the failings of her own loveless
relationship as well as a few other sexual stirrings.
</P>
<P>
   The funniest moments come from the hilarious (and ironically
relevant) meetings for ``ex''-homosexuals at the town church.
Loosely dubbed ``homo no mo''' meetings, the chats end up being a
place to meet partners, as Mark does with a handsome house
painter/artist played by Timothy Vahle.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, these lighter moments are sandwiched between long
stretches of saccharine drama. The cast is competent but uneven _
Chapman and Garrett have terrific chemistry, but the smaller roles
tend to be cheesily bad. The film has a professional sheen,
considering its low-budget origins, but its biggest flaw is its
dismissal of straights as intolerant idiots steeped in such
caricatured villainy that even the most soured gay militants will
be rolling their eyes with disbelief. It's almost as if Herd is
aiming for a dinner-theater melodrama mentality, with audiences
hissing and throwing popcorn at the closed-minded heterosexuals _
rather than understanding what really makes them tick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the Water'' is rated R for profanity, brief nudity,
adult situations and subject matter.

 &HT;    PROBLEMS EXIST WITH QUALITY OF HEALTH CARE, REPORTS FIND
 &HT;    500&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Serious and widespread problems exist with the
quality of American health care, regardless of how it is delivered,
according to two reports published Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``At its best, health care in the United States is superb.
Unfortunately, it is often not at its best,'' said an article in
Wednesday's 's Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).
</P>
<P>
   It concluded that quality problems exist in all sectors of
medicine, including managed care and traditional fee-for-service
systems. While Congress is embroiled over a patient's bill of
rights to reign in managed care providers, the article argued that
``quality of care is the problem, not managed care.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a review of quality in managed care settings found
that few health maintenance organizations are pursuing policies to
ensure that their patients receive proper treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In an article in the October edition of Consumer Reports, also
issued Wednesday, health policy editor Trudy Lieberman noted that
most quality assessments of HMOs have focused on waiting times to
see a physician and patient satisfaction with their care, rather
than the actual treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Reports article was based on questionnaires sent to
more than 300 managed care companies. Only 61 responded with
examples of areas in which they are promoting quality care.
</P>
<P>
   Such areas include providing ``beta blocker'' drugs to heart
attack victims, taking aggressive steps to eliminate adverse drug
interactions and enforcing clinical procedures to determine the
necessity of hysterectomies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plans have a long way to go, but some of them are making a
start,'' Lieberman said at a breakfast with health reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The report listed 16 managed care groups, mostly in the
Northeast, that are leading the way in providing quality care.
</P>
<P>
   Both articles cited underuse, overuse and misuse of medical
services as major problems affecting the quality of care in
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``These problems ... occur in small and large communities alike,
in all parts of the country, and with approximately equal frequency
in managed care and fee-for-service systems of care,'' the JAMA
article concluded. ``Very large numbers of Americans are harmed as
a direct result.''
</P>
<P>
   Much national attention has been focused on problems of
underuse, including lack of childhood immunizations and questions
related to managed care groups withholding of certain types of
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The authors noted that overuse also can pose a significant
health risk. They described overuse as providing a treatment in
which the potential for harm exceeds the possible benefit. An
example they cited would be the prescribing of antibiotic medicine
for treatment of viral infections such as a cold, for which
antibiotics are ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Misuse involves offering a proper treatment that can result in
complications _ such as prescribing certain drugs without
determining whether they will adversely interact with other
medications a patient is taking.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   One hurdle to providing the best care is the explosion of new
information regarding treatments and the difficulty physicians face
in keeping up with new developments in medicine, the JAMA article
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether they are organized in solo practice, in small
single-specialty partnerships or in large, multispecialty groups,
too few physicians have ready access to all the data that would be
useful to them as they care for patients,'' the article said. ``Too
few hospitals take maximum advantage of all of their data in
facilitating efficient patient care while systematically avoiding
preventable complications.''
</P>
<P>
   Examples of efforts to improve quality are ``sporadic at best,''
the article said.
</P>
<P>
   One such example was a study conducted by the New York health
system to assess the outcomes of coronary artery bypass surgery.
The study measured mortality rates for doctors and hospitals and
used the data to improve the outcome of such operations throughout
the state system.
</P>
<P>
   Both articles noted there was little competition among health
plans based on assessments of medical quality.
</P>
<P>
   Both articles also concluded that neither the managed care
system, which tends to underuse medical services, or the
fee-for-service system, which tends to overuse them, were exemplary
models which could be used to promote health care quality.
</P>
<P>
   The article was commissioned by the Institute of Medicine, part
of the National Academy of Sciences, and written by Dr. Mark
Chassin of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, and
Robert W. Galvin of Motorola Inc.

MEDICARE EXPANSION OFF TO SLOW START 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CARL HULSE   
 Washington Bureau, N.Y. Times Regional Newspaper Group   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Medicare beneficiaries looking for more variety in
their health-care menu next year may find the pickings are slim.
</P>
<P>
   Just three health-care plans have applied to the federal
Medicare agency to begin offering new forms of managed care under
the high-profile Medicare Plus Choice initiative. The scant
interest is being viewed as a disappointing launch for an effort
promoted as the beginning of a new era for the huge program that
provides insurance coverage for 38 million older Americans and the
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look like a good start,'' said Carrie Gavora, a
health-policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation. ``It
now appears that at least for its inaugural year, the `Plus Choice'
part of the Medicare program has failed to materialize.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are giving a party and no one is attending,'' said
Marilyn Moon, an expert on Medicare issues at the Urban Institute,
a Washington think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Gavora blames dense Medicare regulations for deterring health
insurers from trying to get a piece of billions of dollars in
Medicare spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sheer size of this market would seem to be enough to
tantalize any private insurer,'' wrote Gavora in a report examining
the initial lack of interest. ``Insurers who wish to participate in
Medicare Plus Choice, however, must accept significant barriers and
government micromanagement as the price of that participation.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Health Care Financing Administration, which
oversees Medicare, suggest that the dearth of applications is
merely temporary. They say the agency only as recently as June
published more than 800 pages in guidelines for the new program,
and companies are still digesting them.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the comprehensive regulations issued on June 26, we
believe prospective plans are taking the time necessary to
determine their approach to entering the Medicare market,'' said
Dr. Robert Berenson, who directs HCFA's center for health plans and
providers. ``Private businesses are deciding how and when to
participate in Medicare Plus Choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, HCFA was gearing up for the prospect of hundreds of
insurers competing to draw beneficiaries into the rapidly expanding
world of managed care beginning in January, preparing a massive
public education campaign to familiarize beneficiaries with the new
options ordered by Congress last year.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to save money and to give older Americans the types of
health-care choices readily available in the private sector,
Congress used the 1997 balanced-budget law to direct HCFA to take
its managed-care program beyond health-maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers wanted Medicare to offer beneficiaries a chance to try
approaches such as preferred-provider organizations,
provider-sponsored organizations and even new medical savings
accounts, a particular favorite of GOP lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The thinking was that the health insurers would leap at the
chance to break into Medicare and use private market efficiency to
offer older Americans benefits they don't now get _ prescription
drug coverage, for instance _ at lower cost.
</P>
<P>
   But the insurers seem leery. HCFA says it has received just two
applications for operating provider-sponsored organizations, which
are health plans organized by doctors and hospitals, and only one
for a preferred-provider organization, an approach that gives
consumers more choice than a traditional HMO. It has received none
for the other types of plans.
</P>
<P>
   The agency thus far has declined to identify the applicants or
disclose what geographic region they propose to serve. If approved,
the three health plans would join the more than 340 Medicare HMOs
now serving about 5.7 million beneficiaries as Medicare's
managed-care component.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance industry officials say they are not surprised by the
minimal early interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time frame is just so quick,'' said Dean Rosen, senior
vice president at the Health Insurance Association of America.
``The fact is, the law was passed a year ago; the regulations came
out in late June. I really hesitate to judge it based on a
six-month time frame.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon expressed a similar view, saying ``I would have expected a
bit more activity, but I think we should watch for another six
months or so.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress said they were disappointed at the level of
interest and said it might reflect HCFA's reluctance to rapidly
expand into managed care.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We have had serious concerns that HCFA was not up to the
task,'' said Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   But Gavora and other experts say part of the blame also lies
with Congress for giving HCFA too much to swallow too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers may also be wondering if Medicare is the pot of gold
they once thought. HMOs are already struggling with Medicare
payment rates and some have begun to scale back benefits and raise
premiums, angering beneficiaries who feel they were lured into
managed-care coverage with promises that are not being kept.
</P>
<P>
   The Medicare Plus Choice program was already experiencing some
trouble. HCFA officials earlier dropped plans to mail comprehensive
new Medicare handbooks to all beneficiaries, instead limiting the
initial effort this year to a few target states.
</P>
<P>
   Even some who favor choice concede that there may be an
advantage to the slow start of Medicare Plus Choice _ it will
minimize confusion among beneficiaries and allow Medicare to
gradually adapt to the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although many beneficiaries may not see an immediate change in
January, virtually all will still have the options of traditional
Medicare or HMOs that they have had in the past,'' said Berenson,
the HCFA official. ``In addition, we expect more choices to become
available throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the best interest of both our beneficiaries and the
plans to have organizations come in that are committed for the long
term,'' he said.

NEW HOPE FOR OVARIAN CANCER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cindy Melancom felt tired and stressed out and suffered vague,
nonspecific symptoms for months: backache, lack of appetite,
bloating, lack of energy. She attributed it to age and depression
over the death of her father.
</P>
<P>
   Then she found the lump in her abdomen that led to a diagnosis
of advanced ovarian cancer. That was 6 1/2 years ago. She was 41.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally demanded some answers. I drug my doctor back into
the exam room and made him feel the lump while I coughed, and I
asked for a transvaginal sonogram. It showed a huge tumor,'' says
Melancom.
</P>
<P>
   New research offers hope for an early screening test for ovarian
cancer, a disease that kills roughly 14,500 women each year _
usually because it is detected late.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reliable early diagnostic test for ovarian cancer.
The CA-125 antigen test detects fewer than 50 percent of early
ovarian tumors and is considered too unreliable for general
screening. It is recommended for women at higher risk because they
carry the ``breast cancer gene.'' An estimated 44 percent of women
who carry one of the genes BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 will develop ovarian
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, researchers reported on a new blood test that looks
for abnormally high levels of another chemical, lysophosphatidic
acid, or LPA, an early sign of ovarian as well as cervical and
uterine cancer. Scientists do not know whether the new test will
prove more reliable than the CA-125, and therefore provide a
general screening tool.
</P>
<P>
   Melancom, who lives in Amarillo, started an international
newsletter for ovarian cancer survivors five years ago. For more
information, call Melancom at (806) 355-2565, or write Box 7948,
Amarillo, TX 79114.

IF YOU CAN'T BEAT 'EM, JOIN 'EM: ANOTHER LIST

<P>
   UNDATED - For the past couple of weeks, I've seen nothing but
lists in the news (top 100 books, top 100 athletes, top 100
musicians, top 100 movies), so I've made my own lists of things I
find both particularly important and worthy list material:
</P>
<P>
   Top 10 Ways to Make Your Boss Fire You So You Can Get
Unemployment (which I call Early Retirement):
</P>
<P>
   1. Walk up and say, ``Hey! When's your birthday? Target has
senses of humor on sale for $39.99, and you could really use one.''
</P>
<P>
   2. Ask to borrow $20 every day for a week.
</P>
<P>
   3. Use the phrase, ``My prison experience has taught me . . .''
in a staff meeting.
</P>
<P>
   4. Mention in passing, ``If you play connect-the-dots with the
moles on your face, it makes a pentagram.''
</P>
<P>
   5. Make a special trip into their office to tell them, ``I'm
going to start to call you `Andy' because I feel like I'm working
in Mayberry.''
</P>
<P>
   6. Say, ``You would be so pretty/handsome if you lost 30
pounds,'' or ``God, I thought you were too old to have pimples!''
</P>
<P>
   7. Diligently greet them every morning with a jolly
song-and-dance routine that you worked out the night before.
</P>
<P>
   8. Ask them if they could hold onto a package of yours ``for a
while till things cool down.''
</P>
<P>
   9. Come to work with an 8-inch hunting knife in a shoulder
holster.
</P>
<P>
   10. Insist on taking a drug test, and present them with a mug of
your urine.
</P>
<P>
   Top One Dumbest Guy In the World:
</P>
<P>
   The groundskeeper at Busch Stadium who traded the Mark McGwire's
hallowed baseball (valued at a million dollars) for a trip to
Disneyland with his boss. Incredibly, I have not dated this man.
</P>
<P>
   Top 10 New Sports Records That Mark McGwire Could Break, With
Some More Help from ``The Man Upstairs'':
</P>
<P>
   1. Exceed his own record of hugging per game by embracing all
spectators, concession workers, security guards and everyone else
he didn't hug when he hit his 62nd home run.
</P>
<P>
   2. Challenge the record of Shelley Smith, Olympic gold medal
winner, by pumping himself full of illegal drugs, repeatedly
passing a pee test and then getting a phone call from the president
to congratulate him.
</P>
<P>
   3. Exceed O.J. Simpson's record by driving in circles around Los
Angeles with police chasing him and Roger Maris' baseball bat
poised at his own head, while Maris' son, Randy, is at the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   4. Roll over Roberto Alomar's record of the number of times he
could hock bodily fluids on others before someone slaps him on the
wrist and prints a T-shirt of him spitting on the same umpire 62
times.
</P>
<P>
   5. Beat Mike Tyson's record of chewing off large facial
features, like a chin, from Sammy Sosa, causing ``Sports
Illustrated'' to run a special issue with the headline ``ALL IN ONE
BITE!''
</P>
<P>
   6. Surpass Latrell Sprewell's record of choking a coach until
the coach actually loses consciousness and turns a deep scarlet
color, after which McGwire blows kisses to the sky.
</P>
<P>
   7. Strip Reggie White of his title by holding a press conference
and spewing out as many racial slurs and insults in a 10-minute
time frame as he can, prompting a collector's edition video sold
for $19.95.
</P>
<P>
   8. Outdo Michael Jordan's record of miserable attempts to play
other professional sports, all played while carrying his son on his
hip.
</P>
<P>
   9. Exceed Michael Irvin's record number of prostitutes,
transvestites and kilos of cocaine he gets caught partying with,
then donate the spoon, a rolled-up dollar bill and the bathrobe he
was wearing at the time to the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   10. Surpass millionaire Steve Fossett's record, generating the
greatest number of rescue attempts while flying around the world in
a hot-air balloon by crashing into mountains, landing in the ocean
and setting the balloon on fire. After the final crash, rescue
efforts are postponed for 30 minutes while members of the Coast
Guard engage in a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Top Six People Who Have No Business Being Naked in Movies:
</P>
<P>
   1. Harvey Keitel. It's not bad enough that I actually saw ``Bad
</P>
<P>
   Lieutenant'' (full frontal nudity), but as if the world hadn't
learned its lesson, he popped up again in ``The Piano.'' On the
horror scale, it's equivalent to walking in on your uncle naked.
</P>
<P>
   2. Sigourney Weaver, in ``Half Moon Street.'' Whoever the
director was who thought, ``Hey! Let's put her in a bathtub with no
bubbles!'' and then vocalized it was a bad, bad man. A man who
should be charged with committing crimes against humanity. Avoid
her naked body at all costs, or close your eyes when you hear the
splash of water. If you choose to view, your emotional and mental
scars will never heal.
</P>
<P>
   3. Oprah Winfrey. The Shirley Temple hairdo is a bad idea.
Should she really follow it up with a reported nude scene in the
yet-to-be-released ``Beloved''? Although I love the fact that Oprah
will wear a body suit and then sit down on TV, I doubt that my eyes
would welcome an exposed belly roll with as much enthusiasm. I
could go into my bathroom and see that.
</P>
<P>
   4. Julianne Moore. While I heartily protest breast augmentation,
her nudie shot in ``Boogie Nights'' just made me feel sorry for her
cornucopia-shaped ``endowments.'' I felt better after she had a
baby and wore a bosom-exposing neckline on ``Saturday Night Live,''
but every time I see her, I still think, ``Oh, jeez. Little pink
boobs.''
</P>
<P>
   5. k.d. lang. My husband saw ``Salmonberries,'' in which the
singer took off her blouse. I found him on the couch with most of
his hair in his lap, pointing at the screen and mumbling, ``They
were like pancakes. Pancakes.'' To this day, he has a severe
aversion to batter-based breakfast foods, although I have since
tried to refer to them as ``flapjacks,'' which apparently made his
aversion worse.
</P>
<P>
   6. Kate Winslet. Ever since we saw her topless in ``Titanic,''
my husband has referred to her as ``a good actress,'' and insists
on renting something with her in it every time we go to Video
Update. I tried to combat this by lying on our couch wearing
nothing but pearls and handing him a sketch pad and a dried-out
ballpoint pen, but the only thing he said was, ``You're right. It's
better in the dark.'' &QL;

CLERGY MEMBERS VOICE SUPPORT FOR PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Members of a moderate-leaning religious
organization founded as a counterbalance to the conservative
Christian Coalition came to President Clinton's defense Wednesday,
asserting that he still retains the moral authority to lead the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   At a forum on religion, morality and politics sponsored by the
Washington, D.C.-based Interfaith Alliance Foundation, nine clergy
members from various denominations voiced support for Clinton, who
faces impeachment proceedings for alleged perjury and obstruction
of justice in connection with the cover-up of his affair with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Frederick James, a former president of the African
American Methodist Church, said Clinton should be allowed to stay
in office in the wake of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's report
to Congress that alleges ``substantial and credible'' grounds for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   James, who attended the Sept. 11 prayer breakfast with Clinton
and religious leaders at the White House, said of Clinton: ``God
has more work for him to do as president of the United States, and
I believe that God will again be with Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   James said he whispered to the president at the prayer meeting:
``My wife and I have long ago forgiven you.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Jack Moline, president emeritus of the Washington Board of
Rabbis, said Clinton has ``had a more positive influence on the
moral character of this country than anybody else'' in the last
half century.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a vision of what needs to happen in this society in
order to bring everybody up to a common level of prosperity and
opportunity that doesn't demand pulling somebody else down to do
it,'' Moline said following a forum on religion and politics
sponsored by the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Davidoff, a moderator in the Unitarian Universalist
Association of Congregations, chided Clinton for having an affair
with Lewinsky when she was a low-level White House employee.
</P>
<P>
   Davidoff said that relationship underscored a ``profound power
imbalance'' that Americans ``should not and cannot forget.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Davidoff added that Clinton's moral lapses were not
unique. ``The entire country has sinned,'' she said. ``We all sin
daily.''
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Dr. Herbert Valentine, the executive presbyter of the
Baltimore Presbytery of the Presbyterian Church, said Clinton's
actions as detailed in Starr's report to Congress highlight
``classic addictive behavior,'' a psychological ailment.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said he believes Clinton's addictive disorder is so
all-consuming that the president may not have realized that he was
lying to cover up his affair with Lewinsky. Valentine added that
addictive behavior isn't easily cured.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Dr. James Dunn, executive director of the Baptist Joint
Committee on Public Affairs in Washington, D.C., said the
president's moral transgression diminishes his moral authority to
lead the nation but ``it doesn't destroy it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Nathan Baxter, the dean of the National Cathedral, said
Clinton has sinned but was not ``totally bereft'' of moral
authority.
</P>
<P>
   The words of support were in sharp contrast to those from Randy
Tate, the head of the Christian Coalition, who has called for
Clinton to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is no longer someone we can look to with moral authority in
the White House,'' Tate said Wednesday as the Christian Coalition
gathered here for its annual meeting. ``He has defiled the office.
He must step down.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Hard to believe: It's been nearly 10 years since Lenny
Kravitz released his debut album, ``Let Love Rule.'' It's even hard
for Kravitz to believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of business where a career usually lasts two
or three years,'' says Kravitz, a music-biz veteran at age 34.
``I'm just fortunate to be here. I can't tell you why I'm still
here _ I just continue to do what I do, to feel what I feel. That's
really all I can say.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for the photogenic rocker, what he does connect with is
a large, loyal following. It's a combination of his graceful voice,
some smart lyrics and an ability to liberally sample musical genres
from different eras.
</P>
<P>
   Combine that with a funky fashion sense that makes the
psychedelic '60s look tame, and it's led some fans to dub Kravitz a
retro act. He disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people go to a Classical concert, they don't call it
retro,'' he reasons. ``That would mean that Jimi Hendrix and the
Beatles and Zeppelin and all these great people were retro in their
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hendrix was totally based in the blues. The Beatles were based
in Motown. The Stones had all these other influences. I don't pay
attention to that (retro tag). Music is not old or new _ I play
what I like.''
</P>
<P>
   The fifth album in his career, simply titled ``5,'' continues to
mix various styles: A little rock here, a little soul there. It all
goes down smoothly, a clever pastiche of genres and trends.
</P>
<P>
   The album's emotional center is ``Thinking of You,'' a poetic
number inspired by the death of Kravitz's mother, actress Roxie
Roker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me feel better to sing it,'' he says. ``It does make
a lot of people cry, though. Even people I don't know _ they
connect it to their family, their experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a song of healing for both Kravitz and his listeners.
</P>
<P>
   ``One guy I played it for, he had just gotten into a big fight
with his mother,'' he recalls. ``He started crying when he heard
it, and went home and made up with her on the spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Such strong reactions to Kravitz's music are not uncommon. A
recent episode of MTV's ``FANatic'' united the singer with a
longtime fan who was literally shaking to be in Kravitz's presence.
It was a riveting, if oddly uncomfortable, piece of television.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was strange,'' Kravitz admits. ``It makes you very humble.
But I really didn't know what to say. You make this music for
yourself, so it's a privilege to enter somebody's life in such a
powerful way.''
</P>
<P>
   That's probably one reason why Kravitz is such an effective
craftsman. He creates the music with no one in mind except himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about people's reactions, or what it means to
them,'' he says. ``I don't even think about people buying it. That
situation you saw on TV . . . what can you say? It's very deep to
him, and you appreciate that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of thing keeps you motivated far more than any of
the money or the glamour or the career or the crap. It touched a
real human being _ that's what it's about, even though that's not
my goal. The goal is to create and please myself. The fact that I
can touch someone else is amazing.'' &QL;

NEW HOPE FOR OVARIAN CANCER
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cindy Melancom felt tired and stressed out and suffered vague,
nonspecific symptoms for months: backache, lack of appetite,
bloating, lack of energy. She attributed it to age and depression
over the death of her father.
</P>
<P>
   Then she found the lump in her abdomen that led to a diagnosis
of advanced ovarian cancer. That was 6 1/2 years ago. She was 41.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally demanded some answers. I drug my doctor back into
the exam room and made him feel the lump while I coughed, and I
asked for a transvaginal sonogram. It showed a huge tumor,'' says
Melancom.
</P>
<P>
   New research offers hope for an early screening test for ovarian
cancer, a disease that kills roughly 14,500 women each year _
usually because it is detected late.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reliable early diagnostic test for ovarian cancer.
The CA-125 antigen test detects fewer than 50 percent of early
ovarian tumors and is considered too unreliable for general
screening. It is recommended for women at higher risk because they
carry the ``breast cancer gene.'' An estimated 44 percent of women
who carry one of the genes BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 will develop ovarian
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, researchers reported on a new blood test that looks
for abnormally high levels of another chemical, lysophosphatidic
acid, or LPA, an early sign of ovarian as well as cervical and
uterine cancer. Scientists do not know whether the new test will
prove more reliable than the CA-125, and therefore provide a
general screening tool.
</P>
<P>
   Melancom, who lives in Amarillo, started an international
newsletter for ovarian cancer survivors five years ago. For more
information, call Melancom at (806) 355-2565, or write Box 7948,
Amarillo, TX 79114.

   LUEBECK, Germany _ Try telling Chancellor Helmut Kohl that he
can't win the German elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't pay any attention to the poll figures,'' he told people
who braved cold wind-driven rain to hear him speak for more than an
hour on a cobblestone square in Rendsburg near here in North
Germany on Tuesday night. ``The voters, not public opinion polls,
will decide the election at 6 p.m. on Sept. 27,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl has been in office for 16 years, long enough for a whole
generation to have grown up not knowing anybody else as chancellor.
At the age of 68, standing 6 feet 4 inches and weighing close to
300 pounds, he presides like a patriarch over the country he
reunified eight years ago and is universally regarded as Europe's
senior statesman.
</P>
<P>
   But after winning four election campaigns, he is in the fight of
his political life for the chancellorship with a Social Democratic
state governor who is 14 years his junior, Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   Polls published this week show Kohl's Christian Democrats have
narrowed the Social Democrats' once-commanding lead to 3 percentage
points, with about a quarter of the voters saying they are still
undecided only 12 days away from the election.
</P>
<P>
   The main issues are Kohl and his seemingly permanent hold on the
country's highest political office, and what to do about
unemployment, which is still stuck at more than 10 percent of the
labor force. The Social Democrats say that with more than 4 million
people jobless and unemployment above 20 percent in parts of
formerly communist eastern Germany, Schroeder will do better,
though he has offered few details as to how.
</P>
<P>
   Ending a day of campaigning here around 10 p.m. Tuesday in this
Hanseatic city famous for its marzipan and immortalized by Thomas
Mann in the novel ``Buddenbrooks,'' Kohl was hoarse after a long
stump speech in which he confronted uninterrupted whistling from
young leftist opponents. ``Pubertarians,'' he calls them, and most
of his listeners cheer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have this chorus at every rally, and you have to admit
that's an accomplishment all by itself,'' he said in Rendsburg, as
if the harassment itself had been winning him centrist support. By
the end of the rally, the evening sun even came out.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign got a second wind last weekend when the
conservative Christian Social Union party of Bavaria trounced the
Social Democrats in elections for the state legislature there, 52.9
percent to 28.7 percent, even though Schroeder crisscrossed the
state and campaigned hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``No trace of a `Schroeder effect,''' the conservative daily
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung observed. But Bavaria has been
conservative for three decades, the Sueddeutsche Zeitung, a
prominent Munich newspaper, pointed out, and was hardly predictive
of the national election. Either way, you can't miss Kohl.
</P>
<P>
   In the red-brick and half-timbered streets of Rendsburg,
volunteers handed out ``Keep Kohl'' buttons picturing him as an
elephant keeping cool with blue lake water in Austria, where he
spends his summer vacations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Helmut Kohl had been the Titanic, the iceberg would have
sunk,'' said one of the many Christian Democratic rivals he bested
over the years, Kurt Biedenkopf, now governor of the state of
Saxony in eastern Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Karl-Heinz Pock, a 62-year-old building inspector who retired
early to try to reduce unemployment among Germany's young, came to
the Rendsburg rally, he said, for only two reasons: ``I want to see
if he's as big as people say, and to hear what he has to say, and I
wanted to hear him speak, but I'm not going to vote for him,'' he
said. ``I've always voted Social Democratic.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohl, in a vast black raincoat, did not disappoint. But after
being in office longer than any other German leader since Otto von
Bismarck a century ago, the chancellor is seen by young people as a
relic from another age.
</P>
<P>
   With polls showing Schroeder slightly ahead, many also expect
that the Social Democrats and Christian Democrats might nearly tie
each other and have to govern in a ``grand coalition,'' something
Germany has not seen since the late 1960s. If that happens, Kohl
says he will have no part of it.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl led his party to a victory with 41.4 percent of the vote
four years ago, when his Free Democratic Party coalition partners
won 6.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   According to poll results published in this week's Der Spiegel,
only 38 percent of the voters now say they will choose the
Christian Democrats, and the Free Democrats may barely squeak into
Parliament with 5 percent, compared with 41 percent for the Social
Democrats and 6 percent for their chosen partners, the
environmentally oriented Greens.
</P>
<P>
   Der Spiegel said the outcome could be decided by the alienated
voters in the former East Germany, where polls show more than 20
percent planning to vote for the former Communists, the Party of
Democratic Socialism. It must win 5 percent of the vote nationwide
to get seats in Parliament, however, unless it wins some in East
Germany outright.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl has used the threat of a Communist-supported ``Red-Green
coalition'' for all it was worth, campaigning here in prosperous
northern Germany, where lavishly restored brick houses stand only a
few miles from where the Iron Curtain ran until communism collapsed
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Kohl said, the Social Democrats have betrayed the
heritage of their earlier moderate leaders like former Chancellors
Helmut Schmidt and Willy Brandt by forming a government in the
eastern German state of Saxony-Anhalt with the former Communists.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Schroeder rules it out in Bonn, but I don't believe him,
ladies and gentlemen _ they are lying to the voters,'' he told
several thousand people who unfurled umbrellas to hear him out for
an hour and a half in the rain last night in front of Luebeck's
14th-century brick-gothic City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl has always campaigned hardest when he was behind, where he
started in three of his last four successful bids for the
chancellor's office, and he has narrowed the gap since last winter,
when Schroeder seemed a shoo-in.
</P>
<P>
   Like his mentor Konrad Adenauer, the founding father of the
Federal Republic who won a fourth term in 1961 with the reassuring
promise of ``No experiments,'' Kohl seeks respect for his
``vision'' for Germany, proven record of accomplishing it and his
prestige in Europe and the United States as a statesman.
</P>
<P>
   With the Cold War over and Germany reunited since 1990, Kohl
would like to remind voters that it was his efforts that brought
those precious gifts. ``World Class for Germany,'' his posters
proclaim.
</P>
<P>
   And if many Germans are wary of the plan he championed for a new
common European currency that begins replacing the German mark next
year, he reassures them that he will see to it that the new euro is
as strong and stable as the mark if he is re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years old when World War II ended, Kohl might as well be
speaking another language when he tells young Germans how hard life
was then for their grandparents, how wonderful it is that war is
today unthinkable between the countries of the European Union, and
what an achievement a 0.9 percent inflation rate is in a country
whose economy was destroyed by hyperinflation in 1923.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these younger Germans take their peace and prosperity
for granted. ``A people that doesn't know its own past can't make
anything of the present, or build a future,'' Kohl told a crowd of
about a thousand people last month the market square in Mannheim,
just across the Rhine from his home town of Ludwigshafen, one of
the few times his wife, Hannelore, appeared at his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think hard about whom you want to take you into the 21st
century,'' he pleaded. Two military draftees who were three years
old when Kohl first took office in 1982, Christian Marquard and
Marco Knecht, listened and applauded. But when asked whether he
thought Kohl could pull a rabbit out of the hat again this time,
Knecht gave a skeptical shrug.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been around a long time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment, Kohl conceded in Luebeck on Monday, was still too
high at 4.1 million, or 10.6 percent. But at the beginning of 1998,
year labor union leaders, who back the Social Democrats, were
predicting that his policies would raise it to 5 million. Instead
it was been slowly coming down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could even be 3-point-something during the next eight
weeks, and that's still too high,'' he said. ``The important thing
is we're on the right track.''
</P>
<P>
   But only two years ago he was promising to cut the rate in half,
which would get it back to where it was when he first took office
in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl does not promise anything really new if he is re-elected;
just more of the same, starting with a plan for income tax cuts
that Schroeder's party blocked last year because they thought it
favored the wealthy. The Social Democrats also favor cuts to
stimulate the economy, but would leave the top rate, now over 50
percent, at 49 percent while Kohl would cut it to 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder also promises to rescind changes in the state-funded
pension system that would gradually reduce the benefit from 70 to
64 percent of average salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schroeder doesn't say a word about what he'd replace it
with,'' Kohl said here. ``The problem is that Germans have decided
not to have as many children as they used to, and the average life
expectancy has risen to 78 for women and 76 for men. That's
wonderful, but it means fewer workers have to support more
pensioners, and if we want to keep the books in good shape we have
to do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The cuts will not affect the already-retired wartime generation,
the parents and grandparents of most of the people listening to
him. ``These are the generation of men who survived the war and
came back to build our prosperous economy in the rubble, and women
who raised children in the rubble of destroyed cities,'' he said.
``They deserve to be supported. But it's fair to ask people just
turning 18 to make a bigger contribution of their own to their
retirement _ if we give them tax rates that make it possible for
them to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's campaign rallies are rituals, kept to a schedule that was
fixed weeks ago. He appears as scheduled, droning on for 90 minutes
through massed loudspeakers in detail that would exhaust an
American audience after 15 minutes. Leftist demonstrators try to
drown him out with whistles and catcalls. There's no violence, but
scores of police surround the assembly and videotape the
demonstrators. Then everybody goes home, where, Kohl tells them,
they should think about what he and his opponent have said and make
their choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Helmut Kohl, too, with all his strength and
weaknesses,'' he said Monday night. ``You've gotten to know all
mine over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   By this reasoning, Schroeder represents risk, the unknown. He
has let it be known that he could work perfectly well with Volker
Ruehe, Kohl's defense minister, if the Social Democrats are the
leading party in a grand coalition. But Kohl warns that that's just
mischiefmaking.
</P>
<P>
   What the Social Democrats are really aiming at, Kohl says, is a
coalition with the Green Party, an unpredictable bunch who have
proposed raising gasoline prices to $12 a gallon in a country where
the ultimate right is to roar down Autobahns without any speed
limits.
</P>
<P>
   After he finished Monday night, Maren Kirmse, a 25-year-old
architecture student at the university in Leubeck, said she hadn't
found Kohl convincing at all. ``He's been saying the same old thing
for almost 20 years,'' she said, ``and Schroeder doesn't show me
much either. I haven't yet decided how to vote, but I'll probably
support a small party like the Greens,'' she said, just to show
change.
</P>
<P>
   As almost everywhere else, Kohl's rally in Luebeck ended with a
brass band playing the German national anthem, sung to the words:
``Unity and law and freedom,'' and not ``Deutschland, Deutschland
uber alles,'' or ``Germany, Germany Over All.'' The tune is the one
Haydn composed in 1797 for the Holy Roman Emperor Francis II of
Austria as ``God Save Emperor Francis.'' Whether the voters will
save Kohl this time will become clear only on Sept. 27, but if
nobody else is sure of it, he is.

 &HT;    NEW MAYOR COULD BRING RENAISSANCE TO CAPITAL
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The upcoming mayor's race between a bow-tied
Democratic bureaucrat and a veteran Republican councilwoman heralds
a renaissance in the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   The November race to succeed Mayor Marion Barry will be between
Democrat Anthony A. Williams, the city's former financial officer
who has lived in the District for only a few years, and Republican
Carol Schwartz, an at-large councilwoman making her third run at
becoming mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it as kind of a new beginning for Washington,'' said
Charles Harris, a Howard University political science professor and
author of two books on the relationship between the District of
Columbia and Congress. ``Barry has dominated the era of home rule
since it began in 1975.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the fall election, whichever candidate wins will represent
reform. It represents a new chapter in the life of the District,''
said Trey Hardin, policy director for Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va.,
chairman of the House Government Reform and Oversight subcommittee
on the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Hardin said Davis knows both Williams and Schwartz and
anticipates that either would be able to work well with Congress.
However, he said it is ``premature'' to talk about any increases in
federal funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly a refreshing time for the District,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barry reigned over District politics for two decades, despite a
one-term interval after serving a six-month prison term on a drug
conviction. Businesswoman Sharon Pratt Kelly served four years as
mayor during that time, but Barry easily retook his office in 1994.
This year, the city's so-called ``mayor for life'' decided not to
seek re-election, and he will end his fourth term in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this as a step toward getting limited self-government
back and possibly going even beyond to full self-government,''
Harris said Wednesday, the day after the District primary
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Barry was never popular with Congress, which has used a heavy
hand in recent years in exercising its power as overseer and
partial financier of the District government.
</P>
<P>
   Local rule was limited and the District's elected officials were
put under a congressionally appointed control board after running
up a multimillion-dollar deficit through fiscal mismanagement.
While taxes have stayed relatively high, the District's public
schools have been ranked as among the worst in the country and
municipal services are a source of relentless citizen complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 48, has campaigned on his qualifications to solve the
budgetary problems. He became the District's chief financial
officer in 1995 after serving in a similar position for the U.S.
Department of Agriculture. Educated at Harvard and Yale, he has
also served as deputy state comptroller of Connecticut and
assistant director of the Boston Redevelopment Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say to Congress we're ready to run the government now,''
Williams told supporters Tuesday night after winning 50 percent of
the vote in a Democratic primary crowded with seven candidates,
including three current city council members.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz, a 54-year-old former special education teacher, was
unopposed in the GOP primary. She captured 42 percent of the vote
in her 1994 race against Barry.
</P>
<P>
   In a city where 60 percent of the populace is black and
Democratic registered voters outnumber Republicans about 10 to 1,
the African-American Williams is the early favorite to defeat
Schwartz, who is white.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a partisan person. I am not a racial person,''
Schwartz told The New York Times. ``They forgive me those perceived
handicaps.''
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates already enjoy a better relationship with
Congress than Barry had, Harris said.

 &HT;    Economic, corporate news gives stocks lift &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- In the closest thing to normal trading in almostthree months, the stock market extended its latest rally to four
straight sessions on Wednesday on a mix of economic and corporate
news.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan disappointed investors
when he failed to give a clear signal that an interest rate cut is
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan testified before the House Banking Committee, which is
considering whether to help the International Monetary Fund provide
financial relief to Asia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But most analysts regarded a rate signal as highly unlikely
anyway, given Greenspan's history of silence about interest rates
before a Fed policy meeting. The Fed meets Sept. 29. In corporate
news, analysts were cheered that the stocks of big-city banks held
up so well despite the weakness of foreign markets where they have
loans. Financial-service stocks also did well.
</P>
<P>
   This helped to give the market a broad-based gain as all stock
averages moved up for the fourth straight session _ the first time
since late June.
</P>
<P>
   Just as significant, it was only the second session in the past
two weeks that the Dow Jones industrial average did not make at
least a 1 percent move up or down.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are still reluctant to predict an early end to the
current sell-off, which many observers are calling a bear market.
The Dow fell 21 percent from an intraday high on July 20 to an
intraday low on Sept. 1. The index fell 19.3 percent on a closing
basis.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson-Humphrey strategist Robert S. Robbins still looks for
renewed all-time highs in the market ``within six months.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins said the market's slide since July 17, when the Dow hit
its all-time high, ``appears to be an increasingly attractive
buying opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The earnings outlook is still unfavorable by most accounts, and
has already resulted in a flurry of ``pre-announcements'' of
disappointing third-quarter reports.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette warned on Wednesday that its third-quarter sales would
be hurt by weakness in international markets. Gillette shares fell
$4.81 1/4 to $40.18 3/4 on 14.4 million shares., more than four
times its average daily volume.
</P>
<P>
   Market volatility might return on Friday, however, when stock
options, index options and index futures expire in the quarterly
``triple witching session.''

 &HT;    Award rejuvenates Tech's tissue research
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- $12.5 million National Science Foundation award will
help create a new national research center at Georgia Tech for the
engineering of living tissues.
</P>
<P>
   The center for ``tissue engineering'' _ replacing defective or
damaged human tissue with medical implants made out of living cells
and natural materials, such as the protein collagen _ will
accelerate the university's four-year research initiative in this
new area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tissue engineering now is where biotechnology was 15 years
ago,'' Robert Nerem, a Tech professor who will head the new center,
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A future goal of tissue engineering, he said, would be to create
a lab-engineered organ substitute to meet the need of patients
seeking transplants.
</P>
<P>
   Tech said it was one of five institutions, selected out of 90
university competitors, to receive a five-year NSF grant for
engineering technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NSF award is like the Good Housekeeping Seal of
Approval,'' said William Todd of the Georgia Research Alliance, a
consortium of government, industry and universities. ``Only the
best of the best are selected.''
</P>
<P>
   Emory University School of Medicine will be a partner in the
tissue engineering center.
</P>
<P>
   Tech's Nerem said the center will pursue research in three
areas:
</P>
<P>
   Blood vessels, for applications with coronary heart disease
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Developing a bio-artificial pancreas, to eliminate the need for
insulin injections for diabetics.
</P>
<P>
   Improving bone substitutes and enhancing repairs of bone
fractures.
</P>
<P>
   The medical payoff of such research will be years away, Nerem
added. ``We're talking 10 to 15 years before something would be
available for patients,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But engineered implants made with living cells will have a
longer lifetime _ and more adaptability _ in a patient than medical
implants made of purely synthetic materials, Nerem said.
</P>
<P>
   Nerem said he hoped that additional private and government
funding would eventually match the NSF award.
</P>
<P>
   The center also will offer educational programs for students at
Tech, Emory, and Spelman and Morehouse Colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Nerem added, ``We would hope some things that we would develop
would lead to startup companies.'' Those firms, he said, could grow
to maturity at the newly created Emory-Tech biotech incubator on
Briarcliff Road. Tissue engineering ``is the next generation of the
intersection of science and engineering for human health,'' added
Todd of GRA, which has provided more than $6 million in funding for
Tech's bioengineering efforts.

 &HT;    Southern fired up over power plant set for Australia
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Southern Co. announced plans Wednesday to build its
first electric power plant in Australia, a $600 million complex
near a coal mine the company acquired last year.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman A.W. ``Bill'' Dahlberg said the company is ``very early
in this process'' of launching the project. It was required to
apply for regulatory approval to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   When Southern acquired Consolidated Electric Power Asia last
year for $2.3 billion, an underutilized coal mine in Queensland
came with the deal.
</P>
<P>
   In all, an estimated 1 billion tons of coal are buried at the
Kogan Creek coal mine, about 175 miles southwest of Brisbane.
That's enough to provide 20 years of fuel for all of Southern's
U.S. plants. But because of congestion on the state-owned rail line
in Queensland, transportation costs for the coal to reach world
markets were prohibitive.
</P>
<P>
   Southern initially considered selling the mine or pressing for a
second rail line to carry coal away from the site before finally
deciding to build a coal-fired power plant adjacent to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to find ways to optimize it,'' Dahlberg said in a
telephone interview from Houston, where Southern announced the
project at the World Energy Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Dahlberg noted the site is near Australia's electric
transmission grid, allowing easy access to that country's
fast-growing electricity market.
</P>
<P>
   If the project wins Queensland governmental approval and
Southern decides it's economically feasible to proceed, it will
take three years to build and start operating by 2002. Southern
expects the plant would provide 600 to 850 megawatts of power.
</P>
<P>
   The project is the largest initiated by Hong Kong-based CEPA
since it was acquired by Southern last year. In June, Southern/CEPA
announced preliminary plans to invest $500 million in two
300-megawatt power plants proposed for China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
   The Queensland plant would employ 1,000 people and account for
an equivalent of about 2 percent of the country's estimated current
capacity of about 30,000 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
   The project, said CEPA managing director Raymond Hill, has ``the
potential to bring industry diversification to an area that is
largely agricultural, meaning new development and new jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Dahlberg conceded other investors have had ``mixed success''
with Australia's electric power sector.
</P>
<P>
   The country of 18 million people is deregulating its power
industry, and a number of other U.S. utilities have invested there.
Southern was outbid several years ago by California-based Mission
Energy on one Australian project.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey-based GPU Inc. last year purchased the state of
Victoria's electricity transmission network for $2.7 billion. In
June, North Carolina-based Duke Energy purchased the 390-mile
Queensland State Gas Pipeline from California-based PG&AMP;E to supply
electric power plants in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Though financing has not been worked out, the project would move
Southern closer to the legal limit for investing in businesses
outside its traditional Southeastern U.S. service territory.
</P>
<P>
   Under a waiver from the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Southern can invest up to 100 percent of retained earnings in such
businesses inside the United States and abroad. Southern currently
has about $3 billion invested in such operations, or about 75
percent of $4 billion in retained earnings.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans on Capitol Hill reacted with fury
Wednesday evening after a political magazine on the Internet
revealed that Rep. Henry Hyde, the Illinois Republican who heads
the committee that will review evidence against President Clinton,
had a long-ago affair with a married woman.
</P>
<P>
   Salon magazine said the affair took place three decades ago,
when Hyde was an Illinois state representative. Hyde, now chairman
of the House Judiciary Committee, acknowledged the affair
Wednesday. But he issued a statement that said, ``The statute of
limitations has long since passed on my youthful indiscretions.''
</P>
<P>
   At a caucus of House Republicans on Wednesday, Hyde said he had
heard that White House allies had hired two law firms to dig into
the personal lives of key Republican lawmakers, according to people
with detailed knowledge of the session.
</P>
<P>
   The White House vehemently denied that report Wednesday night.
Clinton's spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said the president has ``zero
tolerance for this kind of behavior,'' and that anyone engaging in
it would be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   But several angry Republicans were not convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a Democratic Party technique that I am proud to say my
party has not indulged in,'' said Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn.
``When you look at the performance of this White House over the
years, you cannot dismiss that as a possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Salon magazine is aligned with the White House,'' said Rep.
Anne Northup, R-Ky.
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill., said, ``It's coming from the
highest levels of the White House, and if they don't stop it they
are culpable.''
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Hyde said, ``The only purpose for this being
dredged up now is an obvious attempt to intimidate me, and it won't
work.'' On Tuesday, he warned Judiciary Committee members in a
letter of possible attempts to intimidate them through smear
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco-based Salon said it learned of the affair from
a private source, a friend of the woman's husband, and never
communicated with ``anyone in the White House or in Clinton's
political or legal camps.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said his marriage survived the affair. His wife, Jeanne,
died in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The revelations about Hyde came only days after disclosures that
Rep. Helen Chenoweth, R-Idaho, had admitted to an affair with a
married man, and Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., had acknowledged
fathering a child in an extramarital affair. Both are persistent
critics of Clinton. The revelations were preceded by journalists'
inquiries. In the case of Burton the White House denied instigating
them. &QL;

CRIME HOTLINE DRAWS   CURIOSITY, LITTLE ELSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY STACY BROWN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Manning the new anonymous crime-tip hotline
established by the city of Santa Clarita, a suburb 25 miles
northwest of Los Angeles, is like working the Maytag repair line.
Established two months ago, most of the 30 calls the line has
received are from people who simply want to know how it works, a
sheriff's official has said.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clarita Valley sheriff's Lt. Carl Deeley said low
awareness and a lack of advertising dollars are to blame for the
tip line's lackluster start.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many people who don't know it's there,'' Deeley
said Wednesday. ``Out of the approximate 30 calls we've received,
the majority just wanted to know if and how the line works,'' he
said, adding that the department has been desperately trying to
heighten awareness for the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that requires money. We have limited funds available,''
Deeley said.
</P>
<P>
   The tip line was started in July with the Sheriff's Booster
Club, Citizens Advisory Committee and the Anti-Gang Task Force
contributing $6,000 to cover costs, Deeley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've spent quite a bit of money buying magnets to distribute
and making fliers and bumper stickers and other advertising,''
Deeley said.
</P>
<P>
   The tip line was modeled after a successful hotline in the
nearby Antelope Valley. ``They got off to a slow start, too, but we
have a long way to go,'' Deeley said.
</P>
<P>
   At a Wednesday night meeting with the Advisory Committee, Deeley
said a more intensive advertising campaign _ helped in part by an
additional $2,000 donation by the Booster Club _ would be
discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have a booth at the local Business Expo on Oct. 3 and
4 and we have talked with the Gas Co. to ask that fliers be sent
out with bills,'' Deeley said.
</P>
<P>
   According to organizers of the tip line, which is intended for
anonymous information on crimes including domestic violence, child
abuse and narcotics, a big advertising push is already under way.
</P>
<P>
   At Valencia's Mann Theatres, management has agreed to show an
advertisement for the hotline at a minimum price before each
feature presentation. Deeley said officials are hoping neighboring
Edwards Valencia Ten Cinemas will follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at bus stops for advertising and hoping that
local billboard companies will donate some space for the line
because it is so important that we get the word out on the tip
line,'' Deeley said.

CLINTON'S PUSH TO CALM FINANCIAL TURMOIL MEETS OBSTACLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: 2nd take is scheduled to move by 9:30 p.m. ET) 
(mk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's push to quell the global
financial turmoil ran into several obstacles Wednesday, as Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, testified that the world's
big economies had no plans for a coordinated interest-rate
reduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can safely say at the moment there is no endeavor to
coordinate interest-rate cuts,'' Greenspan told the House Banking
Committee, but he again hinted that the global crisis could lead
the Federal Reserve to cut domestic rates. ``Deflationary forces
are continuing to emerge'' in much of the rest of the world, he
said, and they are moving toward the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In another setback to coordinated action, negotiations between
Brazil, the International Monetary Fund and the major industrial
nations over a multibillion dollar rescue package hit political
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian officials appear hesitant to seek aid in advance of
their country's presidential election in two weeks, especially
because a condition for the help would be an agreement to make
unpopular budget cuts, people involved in the negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the political obstacles to coming up with a
rescue package for Brazil _ which Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
indicated Wednesday was the focus in Latin America of American
concern _ and the obvious discord within the Group of Seven
industrial nations over whether a global interest-rate cut is
needed suggests that Clinton's agenda will be extremely difficult
to enact.
</P>
<P>
   American investors had been hopeful that Clinton's call on
Monday for a concerted push to contain the fast-spreading global
crisis would lead to quick action to shore up the embattled
economies of Latin America. Clinton's words, they hoped, would spur
central banks to put aside their traditional fixation on inflation
and cut rates to promote growth.
</P>
<P>
   But Germany's powerful central bank, the Bundesbank, signaled
Tuesday that it continued to see inflation as a threat in Europe,
and officials from other nations have also been playing down the
possibility of quick action on rates or any other response to the
world's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, however, Greenspan said there was evidence
that the robust pace of growth was slowing and that investors were
becoming more nervous about how the global crisis was affecting the
domestic financial system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that despite the still very solid American economy
as of now, there are really the first signs of erosion at the
edges, especially in manufacturing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve will next meet to consider interest-rate
policy on Sept. 29, and despite Greenspan's hints that a rate cut
could be considered, it is by no means clear that the Fed's other
members are ready to act.
</P>
<P>
   William Poole, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St.
Louis, said Wednesday that although the Fed was under pressure to
help other economies and the world financial system, it had to stay
focused on restraining inflation in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   While he did not rule out supporting a rate cut, Poole, one of
the Fed's most ardent inflation fighters, said that an ``attempt to
pursue other objectives that in fact damaged pursuit of price
stability in the United States would only add to world financial
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments this week marked the first time that he had
spelled out a plan of action, and Wednesday, at a news conference,
he told reporters that fighting the financial crisis was ``the most
important subject now facing the world community.'' He argued that
``my objectives were embraced by the leaders, the financial
leaders, of the largest industrial countries in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some of his closest aides conceded in private that his call
for action came late, and that the problems of economic contagion
are now far more complicated than they were in early August, when
he first considered giving the speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should have done this months ago,'' one of his closest
advisers said Wednesday, acknowledging that the plan would be even
more difficult to achieve when the president is fending off calls
for resignation, impeachment or censure.

WALLACE REMEMBERED, FOR WHO HE WAS AND WHO HE BECAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (smw) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. _ The coffin, draped in the blood-red ``X'' on
pure white that is Alabama's state flag, seemed almost too heavy to
carry. Eight young, strong-looking Alabama State Troopers bore the
coffin foot by foot down the massive marble steps of the state
Capitol, some of them having to place two hands on the rails of the
coffin to steady it between them.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the weight of it _ George Wallace was just a small
man, withered even more by paralysis and age _ but the distance.
They carried him some 100 steps, from the rotunda where thousands
had viewed his body, down the steep walkway from the Capitol he had
once used as a war room to preserve segregation, and off into
history. It was eerily quiet, just footsteps on stone.
</P>
<P>
   Just minutes before the troopers carried him off to his funeral
and burial here in Montgomery, Janel Bell, a 32-year-old black
woman, gazed down at the man who had once been shorthand for racism
in America, and then, after begging for forgiveness, had won the
black vote in his final campaign for governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``A servant of the people,'' Ms. Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   A populist, if there has ever been one, Wallace mirrored the
will of the people no matter if it was cruel or compassionate, and
won an unprecedented four terms as governor from 1962 to 1986. But
it was what he would call his greatest mistake _ his defense of
segregation _ for which he will live on, in the history books.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the mouthpiece for what a lot of people thought,'' said
Ms. Bell, a public relations director for the Montgomery Museum of
Fine Arts, mirroring them at their worst, and when their hearts
began to soften.
</P>
<P>
   It was what people said over and over here as Wallace, who died
Sunday night from a heart attack after years of close calls,
finally succumbed to time and the sickness and pain that had been
his constant companions.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, people here said, did not lead Alabama anywhere it did
not want to go. He was leading others in America, there, too,
before Arthur Bremer's five bullets left him crippled but in agony
in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Cal Merrell, 50, drove over from Birmingham, and had
his picture made with the coffin in the background.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard him talk in Valdosta, Ga., when he was running for
president,'' Merrell said, remembering that he was chilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can he have my future in his hands,'' he recalled thinking
then.
</P>
<P>
   Decades later, Wallace shook his hand and called him his
brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried, when I went up there,'' Merrell said.
</P>
<P>
   Older white people mixed with older blacks in a steady but never
overwhelming stream past the coffin, near a bust of Wallace's first
wife, Lurleen, who had also been elected governor but died of
cancer in her first and only term in the late 1960s. People said
she just ran so that Wallace could continue to run Alabama and
build his power base, but she got more votes than he ever had.
Alabamians loved Lurleen, and some of them said with a smile as
they filed inside that now, at last, they are together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's at peace now, you can see it in his face,'' said
Ruby Shirley Noonan, who used to run errands for the Wallaces when
she was 15 years old. ``The pain is gone now.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those who came to say goodbye was James Hood, who was one
of the black students that the governor had tried to turn away from
the University of Alabama when he stood in the door in 1963,
blocking their way.
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of black people who lived through the civil rights
movement, he believes Wallace was sincere when he said he was
sorry, though he can understand why some would doubt him, said Mr.
Hood, who made a career in education administration and now lives
in Madison, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he made peace with God,'' said Hood, 56. He was 19 the
day Wallace, surrounded by a sea of state troopers, blocked the
door.
</P>
<P>
   Decades later, he met with a different Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad with power,''
Wallace told him, Hood recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``If any man understands the true meaning of pain and suffering,
it is George Wallace,'' said Hood, who found himself again
surrounded by state troopers, but this time some of them had skin
the color of his own.
</P>
<P>
   It was not just the physical pain Wallace endured, but the
knowledge, Hood said, that no matter how many times he said he was
sorry, there would always be those who would not believe, or
accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact the people could not forgive him,'' Hood said,
haunted Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Dorethea Knight, 35, from Alexander City, was just a baby when
Wallace left many black people terrified.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're scarred, you're always scarred,'' she said, and
Wallace and the people he tried to suppress have that in common
now. ``Is he at peace, truly? You have to wonder about that?''
</P>
<P>
   As she stood over the coffin, one word crept into her mind?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You forgive,'' she said. ``You don't don't forget.''
</P>
<P>
   As the last of the mourners and just curious trickled out, the
honor guard of state troopers lifted the coffin and made its way,
at least one on unsteady legs, down that tortuous stairway to the
hearse.
</P>
<P>
   At the foot of the hill, 68-year-old John Watkins waited on the
hot asphalt. Like a lot of older lack people, he compares Wallace
to David, in the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``God forgave him, in the 51st psalm,'' Watkins said. ``There's
no reason he can't do it for the Governor.''
</P>
<P>
   As the funeral procession wove through Montgomery, high school
students and black people from a housing project lined the streets
_ not a big crowd, but enough to show that someone important had
passed their way.
</P>
<P>
   At his funeral, ministers stressed that Wallace had found peace
in his faith, and painted a picture of a very human husband and
father, not the demagogue who put civil rights activists at great
risk with his fiery speeches that, some of those activists have
said, were like gasoline on a brush fire.
</P>
<P>
   Lester H. Spencer, the senior minister at the First United
Methodist Church, described how Wallace, who was married three
times in his life, reacted to the death of Lurleen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gently rubbed his fingers through her hair,'' said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
   ```Oh, how much we loved you.''' Spencer recalled Wallace
saying. ```Goodbye, sweetheart.'''
</P>
<P>
   The legacy of George Wallace, the ministers at his funeral said,
should be that he had the courage to admit he was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The crowds were smaller that those for Lurleen Wallace, after
she died of cancer in 1968, and smaller than those who gathered to
pray for Wallace when he was shot. The crowd was much smaller than
those for beloved University of Alabama football coach Paul (Bear)
Bryant, when people lined overpasses to catch a glimpse of his
hearse after his death in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But older people at his funeral said there was a reason for
that. Wallace outlived his cronies, and many of the people who put
him in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``God gave George Wallace a new heart,'' Spencer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legacy of George Wallace is not the schoolhouse door.'' he
said. ``The legacy of George Wallace is one of God and change.''

ANOTHER HUMPHREY PLANS POPULIST BATTLE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DIRK JOHNSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ At a time when Democratic politicians typically
shrink from the populist ambitions of the Great Society era, Hubert
H. Humphrey III is campaigning for governor here on a vow that
government should flex its muscles for ordinary working people.
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey, the son and namesake of the former vice president,
easily won the nomination for governor on Tuesday in the
Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, highlighting his fight against
tobacco companies and his vow to pay two years of college tuition
for Minnesotans.
</P>
<P>
   His Republican opponent, Mayor Norm Coleman of St. Paul, who
switched parties two years ago, has already declared that Humphrey
represents ``the old vision of tax-and-spend politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota, the most reliably Democratic state in the nation in
presidential elections in a generation, has a long history of
electing populists. But the state has been changing in recent
years, with sharp growth in the suburbs, especially among newcomers
who tend to have little familiarity, or fondness, for the
egalitarian-minded Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
   And while Humphrey bears the most revered name in Minnesota
politics, Coleman is a quick-on-his-feet candidate who has won high
praise for his efforts to revitalize St. Paul, which has often been
regarded as the poor cousin of Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, a New York native who was one of eight children, talked
about his humble background in ways unmistakably intended to cast
Humphrey as a son of privilege. ``I never had a silver spoon in my
life,'' Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   A third-party candidate, Jesse Ventura, a former professional
wrestler and former mayor of Brooklyn Park, a Minneapolis suburb,
is running on the Reform Party ticket. Ventura, known as ``The
Body,'' makes an unexpectedly strong showing for a third party
candidate, according to recent polls, which show him drawing about
13 percent of the vote in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual situation for a state that is 95 percent white,
Democrats control both houses of the state Legislature, and a
majority of the congressional delegation. But voters here have been
willing to elect Republicans, especially moderates like the current
governor, Arne Carlson, 65, who is a strong supporter of business,
but also a strong advocate of gay rights and abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman routed his opponent in the Republican primary, Bill
Dahn, 91 percent to 9 percent. Coleman, a radical anti-war
protester in his youth, will try to position himself as a centrist.
But he opposes abortion rights, and refused to sign a declaration
celebrating gay life in St. Paul.
</P>
<P>
   To gain the Democratic nomination, Humphrey bested a field of
well-known candidates, including Ted Mondale, a former state
senator who is the son of former Vice President Walter Mondale;
Mike Freeman, son of former Gov. Orville Freeman, and Mark Dayton,
an heir to the Dayton Hudson department store conglomerate, which
owns the Target chain.
</P>
<P>
   A fifth candidate, Doug Johnson, a state senator from rural
Tower, had campaigned as the only commoner in the race, but the one
with the most authentic Minnesota name.
</P>
<P>
   With all precincts counted, Humphrey won 37 percent of the vote,
followed by Freeman and Johnson, with 19 percent each, Dayton with
18 percent, and Mondale, a distant fifth with 7 percent, The
Associated Press reported.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Humphrey, the state's attorney general for the past 16 years,
has benefited from the public health lawsuit he brought against
tobacco companies that ended in a $6.1 billion settlement for the
state.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat has also promised to enact subsidies that would
provide paid tuition for two years of college for any Minnesotan at
any public or private college in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey, 56, who is known in the state as Skip, shares the
generally populist positions of his father, who was called the
Happy Warrior, but is not as enthusiastic or impassioned an orator
as his father was.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, 49, has said that his administration would concentrate
on fighting gangs and keeping taxes low. He has taken credit for
bringing a National Hockey League franchise to St. Paul, a team
that will be called the Minnesota Wild.

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The stock market's bear may have gone into
hibernation, but the bond market variety is all too alive and well.
</P>
<P>
   Having endured an August from hell in stocks, investors are
enjoying a respite in September. But while many stocks have bounced
part way back from their losses, bonds _ with the conspicuous
exception of U.S. Treasury securities _ have barely budged. August,
one of the most brutal months on record in almost every bond market
around the world, has been followed by a September in which most of
these securities, even if they are up, have mustered only the
merest of gains.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? Through no fault of their own, investors in a
wide variety of bonds, from convertibles to mortgage-backed
securities, found themselves trapped in a game of economic dominos
gone awry. The bond market action in August is a painful lesson in
how the toppling of one market can, in turn, hurt even the most
seemingly unrelated market worlds away.
</P>
<P>
   What began in mid-August with a apparently irrelevant de facto
default on its debt by the Russian central bank wound up hurting
even the most highly rated bonds issued by U.S. corporations with
absolutely no exposure to Russia. The only people who escaped the
disaster were owners of U.S. Treasury securities, which were driven
to historic highs in price terms as a result of some of the lowest
yields in decades.
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Russia caused an about-face in the level of
risk that professional investors were willing to tolerate. As long
as the International Monetary Fund was willing to bail out
countries experiencing economic disarray, investors were
comfortable investing in fledgling markets. Russia changed all
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flight to quality, previously, was out of equities and
into bonds, and any bonds qualified,'' said Martin Fridson, chief
high yield strategist at Merrill Lynch. ``Now that flight is much
more pronounced because investors want to go all the way to the
ultimate quality of U.S. Treasury securities. Nothing in between
seems safe enough.''
</P>
<P>
   What did this new risk aversion mean for various bond markets?
Big losses. In August, investors in emerging market debt lost 28.7
percent of their money, convertible bonds lost 11.8 percent and
high-yield bonds lost 7.4 percent of their value. Real estate
investment trusts that invest in mortgage securities declined an
average 27 percent during the month. Only two non-Treasury sectors
showed gains for the period: municipal bonds rose 1.92 percent and
the highest-rated corporate bonds inched up 0.51 percent. Treasury
bonds, meanwhile, advanced 2.16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds, remember, are supposed to be boring, predictable
investments. No more. ``We've probably crammed about a year of
volatility into the last six weeks in the bond market,'' said
Randall King, senior vice president of asset liability management
at PNC Bank in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The result of all this volatility has been to bring the issuance
of many types of bonds and convertible debt to a near standstill.
For example, only one convertible debt issue came to market in all
of August.
</P>
<P>
   Why does upheaval in one distant market make for losses closer
to home? T. Anne Cox, director of global convertible bond research
at Merrill Lynch explained: ``If investors take a hit in one part
of their book, their risk tolerance is going to decline across the
board. And if everybody does that at roughly the same time, you
could see where you'd get some real liquidity pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurt the most by the bear market in bonds are hedge funds that
made big bets in emerging market debt and brokerage firms that
trade all manner of bonds for their own accounts. Also taking a hit
were commercial banks that trade in the same markets. Adding to the
upset, many of these concerns used leverage to make their bets,
which magnified their losses.
</P>
<P>
   Another piece of bad luck: these big investors typically hedged
against losses in emerging market debt by selling Treasury
securities that they did not own. With prices of Treasuries roaring
as emerging market debt plunged, the ``hedges'' were a disaster as
folks found themselves on the wrong side of both of their trades.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, word on Wall Street is that most fixed-income
departments at major trading firms have given up all they had made
during the first seven months of the year. These departments
usually are big money makers for brokerage firms. Last year, for
example, Merrill Lynch's taxable fixed-income department generated
nearly $1 billion in revenue, 26 percent of the firm's overall
revenue for principal transactions.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, bonuses for employees in these areas are a
dream; many firms have already conducted what are euphemistically
called head-count meetings. Firings will follow.
</P>
<P>
   For individuals, the unhappy sequence of events in the bond
market is all that much harder to take because the losses came when
interest rates were declining significantly. Yields on the
five-year Treasury note, for example, have fallen one full
percentage point in recent weeks. The notes traded at 5.43 percent
on July 1 and fell to 4.43 percent on Sept. 11. Wednesday they were
a little higher at 4.67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With rates moving down, investors are understandably confounded
by losses in their bond portfolios. After all, doesn't Investing
101 dictate that when interest rates fall, bond prices rise?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it does. But Investing 101 could not have predicted the
confluence of events _ the work of professional investors, hedge
funds managers and brokerage trading desks which ran away from
anything with a whiff of risk to it _ that have paralyzed worldwide
bond markets. As the herd stampeded out of junk bonds, convertible
debt, emerging market bonds, even relatively unrisky corporate
issues, buyers for these securities disappeared.

 &HT;    Bickering slowing review
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- When 36 boxes from the office of independent
counsel Kenneth Starr arrived on Capitol Hill last week with a loud
thud, members of Congress quickly vowed a ``bipartisan review'' of
the evidence collected about President Clinton's adulterous affair
with a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   But less than a week after the Starr report's theatrical arrival
on Capitol Hill, the panel responsible for undertaking that review
is being torn apart by partisan bickering. At issue is whether the
Judiciary Committee should make public videotapes of the
president's testimony before a federal grand jury last month
concerning his sexual encounters with 25-year-old Monica Lewinsky.
A vote is expected on the contentious issue today in an executive
session of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   As Georgia Republican Rep. Bob Barr sees it, ``everything should
be disclosed as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   To that, Texas Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee had this to
say: ``Just because we are in the minority, it does not give the
Republicans the right to go back to the Salem witch trials.''
</P>
<P>
   If the squabble over the videotapes is any indication of what is
to come, the impeachment process could make history for its
divisiveness rather than fairness for which the Watergate committee
was known, political scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's roster includes some of the most liberal members
of Congress such as Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) and some of the
most conservative such as Barr and Rep. Charles Canady, a
Republican from Florida. In fact, it is difficult to find a
moderate voice among its 37 members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee is one of the most partisan and ideologically
polarized in Congress,'' said James Bibby, a professor of political
science at the University of Wisconsin and a close watcher of
congressional trends. ``You have a committee where the chairman,
who is clearly a conservative, is considered moderate.''
</P>
<P>
   That chairman, Illinois Republican Henry Hyde, has promised to
deliver hearings that are removed from the partisan rhetoric so
commonplace on Capitol Hill. Hyde, who has the earned respect of
members on both sides of the aisle, is known for his fairness and
ability to craft witicisms that keep even his harshest critics in
the tent.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde even hired a lifelong Democrat from the Chicago area as his
chief counsel of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But whether Hyde will be able to deliver the type of hearings
that Peter Rodino, a 65-year-old Newark lawyer, delivered as
chairman of the Judiciary Committee during the House impeachment
hearings of former President Nixon remains to be seen. Rodino had a
core group of moderates, while Hyde can count on just a handful of
Democrats, if that, to be less than partisan.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the 16 Democrats on the committee represent
constituencies that traditionally are loyal to the president such
as the Jewish and African-American communities, and they represent
districts where they have little challenge in holding onto their
seats.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a quarter of the Democratic members are
African-American, a group that has stood squarely behind the
president from the start of the controversy surrounding Clinton
over his affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   California Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters, president of the
Congressional Black Caucus and a member of the Judiciary Committee,
has said the caucus intends to act as the ``fairness police'' to
protect Clinton from unfair treatment by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   And the other side of the aisle is equally partisan. According
to an analysis conducted by the Congressional Quarterly's Weekly
Report, GOP members of the committee voted with the party at least
85 percent of the time and as much as 97 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Why is the committee so deeply divided?
</P>
<P>
   Political scientists say the polarization stems from the type of
issues the committee undertakes and its lack of moderate members.
</P>
<P>
   Under Hyde's stewardship, the committee has been the venue for
conservative agendas such as legislation banning ``partial-birth''
abortions, same-sex marriages and gun control. It has required
Attorney General Janet Reno to explain why she has not appointed an
independent counsel to investigate the Clinton White House's
fund-raising schemes.
</P>
<P>
   And even before the Lewinsky affair became news, Barr introduced
a resolution calling for the impeachment of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues tend to draw members who feel passionate on one
side of the spectrum or the other. But with just a month before
Congress is set to adjourn, can the members of the panel find a
common ground to evaluate the committee's findings?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Judiciary will be very partisan,'' said Rep. Jim Moran
(D-Va.), who believes that the credibility of the presidency has
been undermined by Clinton's admission that he lied about having an
inappropriate relationship with Lewinsky. ``It's Bob Barr versus
Barney Frank. I can't think of anything more divisive.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barr said that the public sparring is really just
gamesmanship. ``I'd say that 95% of the disagreements on the
Judiciary Committee have nothing to do with partisanship. I don't
consider Barney Frank partisan when he and I disagree on
something,'' Barr said. ``We're disagreeing on principle.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Barr and Frank, the committee's more electric
personalities include North Carolina Democratic Rep. Melvin Watt,
who adamantly opposed the House action to make public the Starr
report, saying it was the work of an overzealous prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This started out in a clearly bipartisan fashion, but it has
erupted into a real war,'' Watt said.
</P>
<P>
   On the opposing side is Florida Republican Bill McCollum, who
has said from the start that perjury, even lying about sex, would
be an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the more even-tempered of the committee.
Members such as Texas Republican Rep. Lamar Smith and Arkansas
Republican Rep. Asa Hutchinson are in this camp, having not made
conclusive decisions on what the report means and urging that there
be a bipartisan accord to evaluate Starr's findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do expect there to be an emerging bipartisan action on the
committee when it comes down to determining what is for the good of
this country,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The more moderate Democrats include Rep. Howard Berman of
California, who is a close friend of Hyde, and Rick Boucher of
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly going to be challenging,'' Hutchinson said.
``These are people who are trained legally; many are strong
intellectuals who are passionate and want to express themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the committee is already splintered over releasing video
tapes, how will it handle determining whether there is enough
evidence to hold impeachment hearings?
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are going to make this work, we have to work together,''
Hutchinson said. ``It's not what we achieve; it's the process we
take in getting there that matters.''

 &HT;    Media map out strategy for playing Clinton testimony
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- In the most anticipated video release since
``Titanic,'' TV networks are bracing for the debut of another
steamy blockbuster _ President Clinton's grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the House Judiciary Committee votes on releasing the
president's videotaped testimony to the media, newsroom executives
and staffers were strategizing over how, and how much, to show
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the vote is yes, then we're ready and have our battle plan
all laid out,'' said Sandy Genelius, a spokeswoman for CBS News.
``We expect the vote around 10 o'clock and we're on full alert
standby.''
</P>
<P>
   The videotape is said to contain scenes of Clinton growing
visibly angry during grilling by Kenneth Starr's prosecutors, and
may contain offensive language.
</P>
<P>
   After the release of Starr's 445-page report over the Internet
last Friday, some TV networks were criticized by the public and by
watchdog groups for reading sexually-explicit excerpts verbatim
during their live telecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Although being the first to break the story is a long-standing
journalistic imperative, the networks are also determining how to
juggle taste with timeliness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't gotten (the videotape) yet, but it's certainly
something we've had a lot of discussion about,'' said John Moody of
Fox News Channel. ``This tape is going to be highly newsworthy, and
assuming that the reports are true and there's a lot of agitated
conversation, we will want to present that to our viewers with some
sort of cautionary crawl along the bottom of the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton testified for at least four hours, CNN plans to
run the video in its entirety without commercial interruptions,
said network spokesman Steve Haworth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Judiciary Committee decides to release the unedited
tape to the public with the premise that the public should be able
to make up its mind about the president, then that's what we're
committed to doing,'' Haworth said. ``We will precede the tape
verbally, and with on-screen graphics advising viewers that some of
the material may be offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   If the tape is released, Congress will likely distribute it via
a ``pool feed'' that would give the major broadcast and cable
networks simultaneous access.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Levin, a spokeswoman for NBC, said the network might use
a tape delay, which would allow censors to edit or omit
objectionable material before broadcasting it to viewers.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's cable network, MSNBC, intends to run the videotape in its
entirety, while NBCV will broadcast excerpts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could feed it out directly, or raw, or put a delay on it
and that will factor into our decision-making,'' Levin said. ``We
know from reading the report there were some salacious issues
discussed and we have to be aware of that while respecting the
historical value of what our viewers might be interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with a delay or some other technological editing tool,
Genelius of CBS said the video poses a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be trickier because the report was the written word
and you could scan and pick what you wanted to read,'' Genelius
said. ``This will be more complicated because, depending on how
quickly we put it on the air, there might not be much time to look
at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rosensteil, of the Washington, D.C.-based Project for
Excellence in Journalism, said media hand-wringing over the
videotape is a healthy exercise, and a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public has despised our performance on this story and
that's not something we should dismiss,'' he said. ``We need to be
mindful about the way we communicate the substance of this story
without violating the propriety people expect, and also realizing
there might be children in the audience.''

 &HT;    Wallace, bygone era laid to rest
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY _ George Corley Wallace's tortured journey from
resistance to redemption ended Wednesday when he was buried in a
hillside grave beside his first wife, Lurleen.
</P>
<P>
   The former Alabama governor who once vowed '``segregation now,
segregation tomorrow, segregation forever'' was escorted to his
final resting place by an honor guard of state troopers, divided
between black and white.
</P>
<P>
   A lone piper played ``Going Home'' and ``Amazing Grace,'' and
four Alabama Air National Guard F-16s soared over the cemetery in
the ``lone man'' formation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He experienced the roar of men's applause, and the shattering
gunblasts of despair,'' said the Rev. Franklin Graham, standing in
for his father, Billy Graham, who led Wallace to a spiritual
conversion in 1983, 11 years after a would-be assassin's bullets
left him paralyzed and in near-constant pain.
</P>
<P>
   The four-term governor, who took pride in setting the nation's
politics on a conservative course even as he repudiated his past
racism, died Sunday night at age 79.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Graham was among several ministers officiating
Wednesday who drew a parallel between Wallace's remorse for the
demagoguery of his younger years and the Christian plan for
salvation.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us have a schoolhouse-door stand inside of us, because
all of us have sinned in the eyes of God,'' said Wallace's
minister, the Rev. Lester Spencer of the First United Methodist
Church of Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer reminded mourners Wallace served more years as governor
in a wheelchair than he did in those years when he promised to
``stand up for Alabama'' in defiance of federal desegregation
orders.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's body lay in state in an open coffin for 24 hours
before the funeral at the state capitol in front of a bust of
Lurleen, who was elected governor in 1966 when the law prevented
her husband from succeeding himself. It was a few steps from the
spot where Jefferson Davis was inaugurated president of the
Confederacy, and a block from the late Rev. Martin Luther King's
Dexter Avenue Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   About 25,000 mourners made their way up the capitol steps to pay
their last respects. The funeral day was a holiday for nonessential
state employees.
</P>
<P>
   Both races were represented in the crowds paying tribute to
Wallace, but the biggest distinction was between those who could
remember the old days and those who couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the epitome of an American politician _ and I didn't
say Alabama, I said America. He understood it was all about people
and promises,'' said James Hood, one of two black students Wallace
sought to prevent from enrolling at the University of Alabama in
his famous 1962 stand in the schoolhouse door. The other student,
Vivian Malone Jones, also attended the services.
</P>
<P>
   Hood, who reconciled with Wallace in 1996, said that even in
attempting to block him from an education, Wallace was living up to
a promise he made to voters.
</P>
<P>
   For Erica Alexander and Briana Perkins, 9th-grade reporters
covering for the student paper at Booker T. Washington High School
in Montgomery, there was no memory of those days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was a pretty mean man, but learning about him
made me realize he was sorry for what he did,'' Alexander said.
They said Washington, which was all black in Wallace's early days,
is now a magnet school for gifted students and is racially ``pretty
mixed.''
</P>
<P>
   Willie Kirk, a former pipefitter, remembered the day he walked
into Wallace's office in muddy overalls to complain about the
state's workman's compensation rules. He ended up being a driver
and labor coordinator, traveling with Wallace to 40 states during
his four presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the things he had to do to stay elected ...'' Kirk
said, letting the sentence trail off into silence. ``But in my
opinion he was the best governor the state ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Wallace's love for the ``common man'' that set him apart,
Kirk said.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Bass, who served as highway director under Wallace, offered
what may be the best explanation for the dramatic changes in
Wallace over his political career.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you didn't vote for him, he wanted you to vote for him the
next time,'' Bass said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had two Wallaces, the one before the shooting and the
one subsequent to that,'' said Joe Reed, the state's best-known
black political power broker. He credited Wallace, in his final
term as governor, with getting blacks on important legislative
committees and funding the aquadome _ which bears Reed's name _ at
Alabama State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought Wallace had some capacity for the little
folks,'' Reed said.

<SLUG> BC-BOND-LOSSES-ART-2NDTAKE-NYT </SLUG>
  
 NEW YORK: securities disappeared.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Typically, bonds of all kinds trade in tandem. But not in this
market; Treasuries have broken away from the pack. ``Everybody's
focused on the decoupling of stocks and bonds,'' said Michael Ryan,
senior fixed-income strategist at Paine Webber. ``What they're not
focused on is the decoupling of fixed income.''
</P>
<P>
   All fixed-income securities, whether convertibles, high-yield
bonds, AAA-rated corporates or mortgage-backed issues, are
traditionally evaluated by how much more their coupons yield than
Treasury securities with similar maturities. Because Treasuries are
as close to a risk-free investment as there is, any bond that is
not backed by Uncle Sam has to attract investors with a higher
interest rate than those investors would get if they bought
Treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the average premium at which high-yield bonds,
commonly referred to as junk bonds, have traded, for example, is a
little under 4 percentage points higher than similar Treasuries.
Now their yields are almost 6 percentage points higher than
Treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of last year, according to John DeMeo at Salomon
Smith Barney, junk bonds traded at a much smaller premium to
Treasuries: a little more than 2} percentage points above the
government's issues. This narrow spread was the result of
yield-starved investors taking as big a gamble as they dared. Those
were the days when investors were utterly confident that there was
relatively little risk in reaching for that larger return.
</P>
<P>
   So, in the months before what was to be a historic flight to
quality, the extra spreads for all non-Treasury debt were extremely
narrow. When investors fled, they were fleeing from bonds that
were, by traditional standards, highly priced. That only compounded
the losses.
</P>
<P>
   Each market has, to some degree, slightly different reasons for
its troubles. Convertible bonds, for example, are tied to the
fortunes of the typically small stocks that are embedded in their
values. These shares have been pummeled by the bear market in
small-company equities.
</P>
<P>
   Junk bonds, because they are issued by companies most vulnerable
to problems stemming from declines in corporate profits, may also
reflect the recent difficulties in small-company stocks and worries
about a recession in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Most investors have probably been unaware of the recent carnage
taking place in bonds. That's because it is a much more disparate
and less transparent market than the stock market. While it's
relatively easy to watch the stock market's ups and downs _ every
move is detailed daily in newspapers, on Internet sites and on
cable television shows _ bond markets are much harder to track.
</P>
<P>
   Because information about trades in these markets is not widely
available, only professional traders and institutional investors
involved in the worldwide bond markets had a ringside seat for the
ugly events unfolding there over the past six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Toting up the dollars lost by investors in bonds in August is
difficult, too, because of the market's opaqueness. But some
numbers are available: $48 billion was lost in emerging market debt
that was denominated in dollars, $14.6 billion disappeared from
portfolios of convertible bonds, another $15 billion was likely
lost in junk bonds and $1.67 billion disappeared during the month
from an index of real estate investment trusts that invest in
mortgage securities. That's about $80 billion lost.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who are not yet aware of the recent turmoil in bonds
may get an unpleasant jolt when they check their mutual fund
holdings. There are plenty of bondholders out there: as of Sept. 9,
according to AMG Data Services, assets held in bond funds totaled
$533 billion, roughly one-fifth the amount currently in stock
funds.
</P>
<P>
   A paralysis unlike anything investors have seen for years is
gripping non-Treasury bond markets in the United States. Investors
who think that September's relative calm in the market is a sign of
stability should not be confused. It is a frozen market, where
nobody's selling because there are no buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an over-the-counter market and you've got to get these
guys to pick up the phone,'' said Carol Levenson, editor of Gimme
Credit, a corporate bond advisory service to institutional
investors in Chicago,
</P>
<P>
   Dealers at major Wall Street brokerage firms are no longer
bidding for bonds from their customers; they will only take an
order if they know they have another customer interested in owning
the bonds. And since few investors are interested in adding to
their bond positions until they see the market stabilize, most sell
orders don't get executed.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the losses that have been registered in bonds so
far probably reflect only a fraction of the real damage done to
these markets. If there was actual selling going on, the prices
would be far lower. But as long as investors are not forced to
sell, the market simply feels ominously quiet.
</P>
<P>
   With the year winding down, more and more investors may be
forced to sell their holdings. If the market does not rebound by
the end of the year, many large firms want to have their trading
portfolios whittled down.
</P>
<P>
   What might the next few months bring to bond investors? Don't
expect a big rebound. With Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
declining to elaborate on investors' hopes that he will cut
interest rates at the Sept. 29 meeting, the market in all but
Treasuries will likely remain frozen.

FRANK KIMMEL TURNING UP THE HEAT IN ARCA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Frank Kimmel's slickest move during his run
to the 1998 ARCA Bondo/Mar-Hyde Series championship was recorded,
ironically, away from the racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   Kimmel, crew chief Jeff Lemons and team co-owner Larry Clement
relocated the heart of their outfit from New Lebanon, Ohio, to the
Louisville, Ky., area two races into the 22-event season. The
mid-March move cut three hours of driving time between Kimmel, who
lives in Jeffersonville, Ind., and Lemons, allowing them to work
elbow-to-elbow in their new shop.
</P>
<P>
   The rearranged relationship has allowed Kimmel a more hands-on
approach to his car, and made it easier for Lemons to plot race-day
strategy during the week. A career-high nine Automobile Racing Club
of America victories have ensued. Heading into Texas Motor Speedway
for the inaugural Cowtown 250 on Saturday, Kimmel &AMP; Co. are on pace
to capture their first series championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really concerned about moving the team and upsetting
everything,'' said Kimmel, 36, runner-up to three-time series
champion Tim Steele by 90 points in 1997. ``Our team was strong _
and it's only gotten stronger. I've always been a real hands-on
type of driver, and this is bringing the cars closer to me. I think
it helped Jeff also. It was a tough deal, but it's paid big
dividends.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Kimmel won only one ARCA race and scored 13
top-fives en route to his second-place points finish. ARCA's
winningest driver of the 1990s, Steele racked up 12 victories and
15 top-fives in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we ran second so much to Tim Steele that we knew we
had to step up our program _ pit crew, car preparation and
motors,'' Lemons said. ``Tim Steele outspent us, and we did
everything we could to get on his level.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Lemons and the team's fleet of cars have been moved to
Louisville _ within easy driving distance of Kimmel's
Jeffersonville zip code _ the program has produced nine victories,
two second-place finishes and three third-place results in 17
starts.
</P>
<P>
   Kimmel will take a comfortable 500-point lead (4,640-4,140) over
runner-up Mark Gibson into TMS, already a part of the Winston Cup
schedule Kimmel and Lemons would love to get a crack at in the near
future. The Midwest-based ARCA tour has been a steppingstone in the
superspeedway careers of a list of prominent Winston Cup drivers
that includes Mark Martin, Ernie Irvan, Ken Schrader, Sterling
Marlin, Ted Musgrave, Dick Trickle, Davey Allison and 1992 series
champion Alan Kulwicki.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd already proven I can finish a race and not tear up
equipment,'' said Kimmel, driver of the No. 46 VisionAire/Advance
Auto Parts Chevrolet Monte Carlo. ``That's all well and good, but
to turn heads and do something in a different division, you've got
to win. We've proved this year we can win on different racetracks _
and big racetracks.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of Kimmel's three superspeedway victories this season have
been recorded at Charlotte Motor Speedway and Atlanta Motor
Speedway _ sister facilities to the 1.5-mile TMS. Working with a
budget of approximately $300,000, Kimmel and Lemons are committed
to squeezing every cubic dollar out of the third year of their
association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank and I used to talk about our race strategy over the
phone,'' said Lemons, 34, of Clarksville, Ind., just across the
Ohio River from Louisville. ``Frank showed up at my shop (in Ohio)
maybe four times a year. Now, we're working side by side.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimmel's mechanical prowess is a family tradition. His father,
Bob, not only founded Kimmel Auto Parts, but he also scored three
ARCA victories during his racing career. Frank Kimmel is parts
manager of the family business, though big brother Billy runs the
store. That allows Frank to work as a builder of race car chassis
and engines campaigned by local short-track drivers _ everything
from Late Models to Bombers.
</P>
<P>
   Lemons and chief mechanic Scott Heineman, also of Clarksville,
are the team's only full-time employees. In fact, Kimmel said most
of his pit crew still lives in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has been an adjustment for them, but they've been great
about the change,'' Kimmel said. ``We've all really gone after (the
championship) hard. I felt we could win a few races this year, but
nothing like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimmel's success has not gone unnoticed by those in the Winston
Cup ranks. Former series champion Bill Elliott invited Kimmel to
test drive the No. 13 FirstPlus Financial Ford Taurus he co-owns
after the Brickyard 400 in August. And Kimmel substituted for Cup
regular Jimmy Spencer in the No. 23 Winston Ford at Michigan
Speedway on Aug. 16, after Spencer was knocked groggy at the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made the race at Michigan through qualifying (36th), which
was important for me,'' said Kimmel, who nailed the last spot
available via time trials. ``Dale Earnhardt was right beside me and
three Jack Roush cars were behind me, and I said `This is pretty
neat!'
</P>
<P>
   ``We ended up 31st after a bad call on a pit stop, but that was
my first Winston Cup experience. I thought we did very well. We
raced all day long, and got to race some of the best.''

MEXICO FLOOD TOLL UNKNOWN, AND RELIEF AID RUNS LOW  
(JT)

<TEXT>
<P>
   TRES PICOS, Mexico _ A fetid sand bank covers the place where 50
thatched-roof huts stood until the Pedregal River, swollen with
rainfall, churned down from the mountains to bury them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard the crack of the dam above town when it gave way, so
we knew to leave everything and get out,'' said Jose Ines Salazar,
22, whose wood house is among those encased in mud.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar said he believed that because of the warning all his
neighbors had escaped, as well.
</P>
<P>
   But in the confusion after the worst floods in Mexico in this
century, floods that washed away or interred thousands of houses
along the Chiapas coast, no one is completely sure what lies under
the forbidding mound in the middle of the river.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days after the floods began their destruction many coastal
communities remain cut off from overland deliveries of aid, and the
government's helicopter airlift has been slowed by new rain and a
lack of supplies.
</P>
<P>
   In several villages that had been isolated for more than a week
hungry people fought one another for precious tortilla flour and
bottles of water when army helicopters loaded with emergency food
touched down.
</P>
<P>
   Officials acknowledged that they might never know how many
people died in the disaster, in which 15 rivers jumped their banks
to inundate communities along the length of the 160-mile coast.
Many people have reportedly been carried away by rushing waters or
lost in mud flows like the one here.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said the bodies of 120 victims had been
recovered, including some that had been buried without having been
identified. But with at least 35 villages still out of
communication, the authorities have not compiled a systematic
record of the missing.
</P>
<P>
   In Pijijiapan, one of the worst-hit coastal towns, residents
have been digging in a foul-smelling mud flow that obliterated an
entire neighborhood in a predawn torrent on Sept. 7. The residents
said they believed that dozens of people might be buried there.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the crisis President Ernesto Zedillo announced that
Mexico would not seek international help because the country's
resources were adequate to deal with the calamity. He has visited
Chiapas three times since the flooding began and is overseeing the
relief effort, in which the armed forces have the lead role. On
Wednesday he returned to Chiapas for a fourth tour to inspect
damage and relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask people not to become desperate, because we are using
every means possible to get you the necessary aid in the next few
days,'' Zedillo said on Monday in a televised address.
</P>
<P>
   In view of Mexico's comments on self-sufficiency, the United
States donated a token $25,000 to the relief effort. Pope John Paul
II sent $50,000 in aid, to be channeled through Catholic groups.
Guatemala helped by opening its borders with Mexico to vehicles
that carried emergency supplies.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of what Zedillo called the unprecedented mobilization
of 70 military helicopters and emergency crews from all the federal
social agencies, the needs of people in the damaged areas are
overwhelming the relief campaign.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday stormy weather grounded many helicopters for hours
at their base near Tonala. Others took off half empty because food
and water packages were not arriving quickly enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are suffering for food,'' said Guillermo Cortes, a state
police officer who was heading home on medical leave when surging
waters trapped him along the coastal road. Cortes walked 30 miles,
scrambling over gutted bridges and tangled piles of uprooted trees,
to reach his house in the flood-soaked hamlet of Nuevo Morelos.
</P>
<P>
   Cortes and his neighbors received bottles of fresh drinking
water for the first time Wednesday. ``We can only turn to the
government for help, and help is not coming fast enough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage of supplies made people frantic. They began to
realize that their communities would probably not recover fully
from the damage.
</P>
<P>
   In the seaside village of La Polka, people once used their
canoes to fish the shallows for shrimp to export to the United
States. Now they have to use canoes to go to their front doors,
because the river and sea waters rose together to leave half the
town immersed. The coastal waters are so contaminated with refuse
and dead animals that shrimping is impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``When are we going to be able to rebuild this town?'' a
shrimper, Jaime Ruiz Ortega, 52, asked. ``Never.''

U.S. AND IRAN, IN FURTHER THAW, WILL JOIN IN U.N. AFGHAN TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By PHILIP SHENON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States and Iran are facing the prospect
of their highest-level diplomatic contact in nearly 20 years, with
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright expected to attend a meeting
at the United Nations next week that is likely to include her
Iranian counterpart, Western diplomats said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said the meeting, which has
been called to discuss the crisis on Afghanistan's border with
Iran, would not result in direct conversations between Albright and
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi. Several other foreign
ministers are also expected to attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials said there is symbolic significance
in the fact that Albright and Kharazi are likely to be together in
the same room for hours, discussing a matter of importance to both
countries. There has been no such high-level diplomatic contact
between the two nations since shortly after Iran's Islamic
Revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats said that Albright had already decided to
accept the invitation to the New York meeting, which is being
organized by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, and that Kharazi is
expected to announce shortly that he will also attend.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, which is being held on the sidelines of the U.N.
General Assembly, will focus on a crisis embroiling Iran and the
militant Taliban movement in Afghanistan that has threatened to
flare into war.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis began with the recent killings of at least eight
Iranian diplomats and a journalist by Taliban forces, who control
most of Afghanistan, during an attack on the Iranian consulate in
the northern town of Mazar-i-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   Also invited to the meeting, diplomats said, were the foreign
ministers of six of Afghanistan's other neighbors: Russia, China,
Pakistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
   While noting the symbolic importance of a meeting between
Albright and Kharazi, a senior administration official said that
the gathering would deal with ``the subject of Afghanistan in the
context of Afghanistan _ this would not constitute the direct
dialogue with the Iranians that we've been asking for in order to
resolve our problems.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, Albright called on Iran to join the United States in
developing a ``road map'' for normal diplomatic and trade relations
after years of hostility that began with the revolution and the
taking of American hostages at the American Embassy in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has so far rejected the idea, though its new, more moderate
president, Mohammad Khatami, has praised the Clinton administration
for softening its tone. Both Khatami and Clinton are scheduled to
address the General Assembly next week. Administration officials
said the two men would not meet.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, which are not officially represented at the United
Nations but are eager for the organization's help in avoiding a
clash with Iran, agreed Wednesday to U.N. conditions for sending a
relief team to the city of Bamiyan, which fell to the Taliban on
Sunday. The United Nations has expressed concern over reports of
the killing of civilians in Bamiyan and nearby villages.
</P>
<P>
   Two Iranian diplomats missing and feared dead since last month's
attack on their consulate were reported Wednesday to have reached
Iran safely. One, who had been in the consulate when it was stormed
by the Taliban, said that everyone else in the compound had been
executed and that he had been left for dead. &QL;

PRESIDENT TO ANNOUNCE NEW PROTECTIONS FOR HMO PATIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.D., Mass.)  (smw) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Taking unilateral action while Congress squabbles
over legislation, President Clinton on Thursday will announce new
consumer protections for more than 15 million Medicaid patients in
health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules range from a requirement that HMOs allow women to
have direct access to obstetricians and gynecologists, without
getting a referral or prior authorization, to a guarantee that
health plans will pay for emergency services whenever a ``prudent
lay person'' would consider them necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the new rules showed that they
continued efforts to advance the president's policy agenda,
undistracted by the uproar over the president's affair with Monica
Lewinsky, the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid, which is financed jointly by the federal government
and the states, provides health care for poor people. It pays for
one-third of all births and finances care for more than one-fourth
of the nation's children.
</P>
<P>
   The president says his action responds to problems and abuses
documented in more than a year of work by a federal advisory panel
that he appointed in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is considering legislation that would guarantee similar
protections for all Americans with public or private health
insurance, through HMOs or any other form of coverage. Republicans
blocked consideration of the bill in the Senate on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to announce the new consumer protections in a
speech to the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
</P>
<P>
   The new standards are important because more and more states are
requiring Medicaid patients to get their care from HMOs.
Administration officials said the new rules would take effect late
this year or early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The rules include these standards:
</P>
<P>
   _A Medicaid HMO must have an adequate number of medical
specialists to meet the needs of its members. Patients with chronic
or severe medical conditions must be allowed to go directly to a
qualified specialist on the health plan's roster of approved
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   _A Medicaid HMO may not prohibit doctors from telling patients
about expensive treatment options, regardless of whether such
services are covered by the health plan.
</P>
<P>
   _Health plans must allow Medicaid patients to challenge
decisions to deny, limit or terminate coverage of services.
Consumers must be able to file appeals with HMO officials and then,
if necessary, with an independent panel of medical experts.
</P>
<P>
   _HMOs serving Medicaid patients must provide consumers with
easy-to-understand information about the benefits they offer and
any fees or copayments they charge. Each health plan must also
provide a list of the names and addresses of the doctors and
hospitals that may be used by its patients.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules, if a state requires Medicaid recipients to
enroll in HMOs, it must give each family a choice of two or more
health plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday found itself at an impasse as
Republicans blocked consideration of the ``patients' bill of
rights'' proposed by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, tried
to offer the health care measure as an amendment to the annual
appropriations bill for the Interior Department. But through a
series of parliamentary maneuvers, Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi,
the Republican leader, prevented the Senate from debating the
health care bill.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., complained that the
Republicans were muzzling the Senate to spare Republicans from the
embarrassment of voting against a popular bill.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Republicans said they would be willing to have a
debate on a Republican bill to regulate HMOs, with each side free
to offer three amendments. Kennedy said the Democrats wanted a much
more extended debate, so they could expose what they see as flaws
in the Republican bill and offer amendments to improve it.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the patients' bill of rights was one of Clinton's top
political goals this year. Republicans said they felt less need to
respond to the president's agenda, and more secure in their
election campaigns, because of the crisis in the White House.

SPORTS COLUMN: CARDINALS HAVE OTHER STORY LINES  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By IRA BERKOW    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's a rookie, has been in the major leagues for all of one
week, and already he has been booed vigorously. When he walked into
the interview room after a pair of good games Tuesday night,
virtually everyone in the crowd of reporters not only walked out,
but also rushed out. ``I'll have no one to talk to,'' he said,
fanned by the breeze of the swiftly departing.
</P>
<P>
   When he had come to bat in the ninth inning of the Cardinals'
first game against the Pirates that night, the cheering by the
crowd of 42,422 in Busch Stadium was so thunderous that, he said,
he had trouble focusing on the pitcher. But the cheers were for the
guy who had batted ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   The cheering was for Mark McGwire, who had just socked his 63d
home run of the season. In that game, the rookie, J.D. Drew, who
just seven days earlier had been called up from the minor leagues,
hit two home runs _ the second and third of his terse big league
career _ and in the second game of the doubleheader he struck a
pair of doubles. He also threw out a runner at the plate from his
station in left field.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the noise after McGwire's homer, the slugger paused for
a moment to say something in the ear of young Drew, who was on
deck. ``I'm happy to hit a home run for your first two-home run
game,'' McGwire told him.
</P>
<P>
   Later, McGwire said: ``This kid's a talent. It's going to be
nice to play with him in the years ahead. He's a lot more advanced
than I was as a rookie.''
</P>
<P>
   After his two-homer night, Jonathan David Drew took the quick
exit of the scribes in stride, since he was following McGwire into
the room. ``I would have got out of there, too,'' he said.
``McGwire's the reason everyone's showing up at the park.''
</P>
<P>
   For Drew, the McGwire spectacle has been remarkable. This
season, after all, he had been toiling in the relative privacy of
the independent Northern League, of Class AA Little Rock and Class
AAA Memphis, his last stop before St. Louis _ and batting over .300
everywhere he materialized. ``My first day in the big leagues was
when Mark hit his 62d homer,'' Drew said. ``And then came the 63d.
It's being a witness to history.''
</P>
<P>
   And he stands in the outfield during batting practice and stops
to watch McGwire hit his shots, which are hit so high and far they
appear like little white satellites. But while respectful, he
hardly seems awestruck.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Wednesday night's game against the Pirates _ he was
scratched from the starting lineup because of a stiff back _ Drew
was hitting .350 in eight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a calmness to him,'' said his manager, Tony La Russa.
``He doesn't play beyond himself. Like the way he got set for the
fly ball and threw home. Full confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of all the McGwire turmoil, there suddenly and
almost furtively appears a star in the making. And the boos? They
were heard when he made his first appearance in the big leagues in
a game last week in Cincinnati. They issued from enemy fans who
were happy to give grief to the 22-year-old newcomer out of
Valdosta, Ga., and Florida State, since he had refused to sign with
the Phillies after being the second pick over all in the 1997
draft. Drew and his agent, Scott Boras, didn't like the money being
offered and opted to try Drew's luck a second time around; he was
drafted by St. Louis and signed a deal in July for $7.5 million for
four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is a business, and the higher up you get the more of
a business it is,'' Drew said.
</P>
<P>
   Some players expressed dissatisfaction at the amount of money
the 6-foot, 185-pound outfielder was able to command. Not that they
were jealous, of course. ``Sure,'' said Willie McGee, the veteran
Cardinal outfielder, ``maybe there was resentment by some players
for his getting big money and never having played in a major league
game, but I don't fault nobody for standing up for what he thinks
is right.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew decided to buck the system, and that doesn't always make
friends right away. But Busch Stadium fans have cottoned to him,
and chant ``Drew! Drew!'' when he approaches the plate _ unless
McGwire has just sent one soaring.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just might be as good as everyone says he was,'' said Gene
Lamont, the Pirate manager. ``He's got good power, especially for a
small guy, and he looks like he's under control at bat. He runs the
bases aggressively, though he's not a burner. Pitchers will see
ways to throw to him, and he'll have to make his adjustments.'' In
other words, time will tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just getting his feet wet,'' McGee said, ``but it seems
like he's been here before.''

HARVARD EXPANDS FINANCIAL AID TO UNDERGRADUATES  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By KAREN W. ARENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Princeton, Yale and other selective universities announced
more generous financial aid plans for students last winter, Harvard
was noticeably absent.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Harvard announced that it would spend some of its
endowment _ now $12.8 billion _ by giving students more generous
financial aid. Harvard said it would raise its direct grants by
$2,000 a student, reducing the amount of money the students need to
borrow or the hours they need to work to afford Harvard's $31,132
yearly cost.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, effective immediately, will benefit about half of
its 6,600 undergraduates, who receive an average of $15,000 in
scholarship grants.
</P>
<P>
   The university will also allow students to keep all of the
outside scholarship money they earn, rather than reducing the
amount of financial aid it gives, as it and many other universities
do now. Until now, a student who won a $1,000 outside scholarship,
would see Harvard's financial aid reduced by $600.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main concern in making these changes is to keep the doors
of Harvard College open to students from different backgrounds,
whatever their financial means,'' said Harvard's president, Neil
Rudenstine.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the additional grant would make Harvard's
financial aid program one of the most attractive among the
``need-blind'' universities, which admit students without looking
at their ability to pay and then provide the means for them to
attend through grants, work and loans.
</P>
<P>
   Rudenstine said the change should also reduce the role that
student debt might play as students made career decisions. The
average Harvard student who receives financial aid graduates with
debt of about $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes at a time when endowments at universities
have soared, renewing questions about why they do not spend more
money for financial aid, research and faculty salaries. Harvard's
endowment, $12.8 billion, is far above that of any other
university. Next is the University of Texas system, with $7.6
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Princeton, Yale, Stanford, Columbia and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology made a variety of changes in
their financial aid policies too.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Knowles, dean of the faculty of arts and sciences at
Harvard, said the decisions by the other universities was a factor
in the timing of Harvard's action. But Knowles said, ``It is the
continuing success of our fund-raising campaign and of our
endowment that has allowed me to commit these new funds.'' He said
the university was also raising financial aid for graduate students
and lowering the maximum undergraduate class size to 18 from 20
students.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

   Harvard officials said that even though other universities
announced their financial aid changes before students made their
college choices in May, the university did not lose out in the
bidding. Nearly 80 percent of the students it accepted chose to
attend _ the highest proportion in more than 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   William Fitzsimmons, dean of admissions and financial aid at
Harvard, said he thought the changes would not significantly affect
applications this year but might do so in the long run, because he
expected students to have a better experience while at Harvard with
more money.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard estimates that the new undergraduate financial aid will
cost an extra $9 million this year, bringing the total it spends on
scholarship grants to about $53 million.  &QL;

U.S. EASES EXPORT CURBS ON ENCRYPTION SOFTWARE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration announced Wednesday that
it was relaxing export controls for encryption software used by
several industries, including certain medical, insurance and online
commerce companies.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, made at the White House by Vice President Al
Gore, is another concession to industry and even some agencies
within the federal government that have been pushing the
administration to relax export controls on data-scrambling
technologies, despite the Justice Department's insistence that
controls remain tight.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the administration relaxed controls on the exports of
encryption technology to banks and other financial institutions in
45 approved countries, and Tuesday's announcement added the new
industry sectors to that list.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy White House Chief of Staff John Podesta said the
decision, made after extensive consultation with industry, was not
the last word in the long and contentious debate over encryption
between the government and industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the course of the next year, we will determine what
further updates are necessary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Business executives and industry groups welcomed the
announcement but said more was needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a step in the right direction, but I hope it's not the
end of the discussion,'' said Doug McGowen, who manages encryption
hardware and software issues for Hewlett-Packard Co. And Jerry
Berman, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Democracy
and Technology, complained that ``The administration is giving us
half a loaf in the encryption debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new administration program, any company is free to
export less sophisticated 56-bit data-scrambling programs with few
restrictions. In addition, they can export even the most
sophisticated encryption technologies to their own subsidiaries
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies as well as health and other medical
organizations _ excluding biomedical and pharmaceutical companies _
are freed from the most stringent export controls. So are online
merchants involved in electronic transactions with other online
merchants in the 45 approved countries.
</P>
<P>
   Other exports will continue to be reviewed on a case-by-case
basis.

COLT EXPECTED TO HOLD HIS OWN IN RACE AGAINST HIS ELDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sm) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ In the 44 years that the Woodward Stakes has been
run at Belmont Park, only 11 winners have been 3 years old. But
Shug McGaughey, who beat older horses in the Woodward twice in the
last decade with the 3-year-old stars Polish Navy and Easy Goer,
thinks he has another good chance on Saturday with Coronado's
Quest, a reformed head-case who will face three of the best senior
horses in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Coronado's Quest has a five-race winning streak, a 5-pound
advantage in the weights because he is a junior horse, and a shot
at the 3-year-old championship. All he has to do is outrun Free
House, who is 4 years old and has not lost this year; Skip Away,
who is 5 and has an eight-race winning streak, $9.2 million in
winnings and the inside track on Horse of the Year; and Gentleman,
who is 6 and has won 13 of his 21 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any 3-year-old must have the talent and the experience to run
with older horses,'' McGaughey said Wednesday at Belmont Park.
``But this is the time of year to try it, when they are maturing
and maybe the older horses have been carrying weight all year and
beating each other up. And we get a 5-pound weight advantage for
being 3.''
</P>
<P>
   He considered why these arguments had won out over making a trip
to Louisiana one week later to compete against other 3-year-olds
for $1 million in the Super Derby, and said, ``I'm looking forward
to walking to the paddock at Belmont Park instead of flying to
Louisiana and running him in the heat.''
</P>
<P>
   All things considered, McGaughey said, ``It's a very difficult
challenge. These are extraordinary horses he'll be facing. But I'm
looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Woodward will in all likelihood be the final hometown
appearance for Coronado's Quest, who is being syndicated for $15
million and will be retired after this season for a career as a
stallion. McGaughey said that he understood the motivation of the
colt's owner, Stuart Janney III.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed he'll retire at the end of the year,'' the
trainer said. ``But I can understand it. Any time you take a horse
of his talent out of your barn, it's not easy to replace him. But
what would we be facing next year? He wasn't comfortable in Florida
last winter, when he became so unruly and acted up. And the
Breeders' Cup next year is being held at Gulfstream Park in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``So right now we are looking at the Woodward at Belmont and the
Breeders' Cup at Churchill Downs. I don't see any chance of our
running in the Jockey Club Gold Cup in three weeks. There's a
slight chance of the Cigar Mile in November at Belmont. But I'd say
he has two more races, the Woodward and the Breeders' Cup
Classic.''
</P>
<P>
   McGaughey acknowledged that Coronado's Quest was racing three of
the highest-ranked horses in the country, and even pictured an
early speed test between Skip Away, with Jerry Bailey riding, and
Coronado's Quest, with Pat Day replacing the injured Mike Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we break sharp and Skip Away doesn't,'' he said, ``we'll be
happy to take the lead, especially with five pounds less. We'll
play off the break, and let Pat take it from there. But I'm not
going to count on it that Skip Away is showing signs of wear. And
Free House has had only two races this year, but he won them both
and he's fresh. He's probably the horse to beat.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was expected that when the entries are drawn Thursday, the
Belmont odds maker would make Skip Away the horse to beat with Free
House second. After that, young Coronado's Quest and Gentlemen.
They will probably be joined by Running Stag, a 4-year-old son of
Cozzene, who flew to New York last Monday from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Mandella, the trainer of Gentlemen and the man who ended
Cigar's 16-race winning streak, conceded that he had to deal with
his horse's advanced age as frequently as McGaughey had to deal
with his colt's junior age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to deal with his age every day,'' Mandella said. ``I'm
sure Bill Mott had the same feeling with Cigar at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mandella agreed that the Woodward, with its stars of all
ages, looked like the race of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you could have a better group of horses in a
race than this group,'' he said. ``I don't even know which one I
should fear the most.''

CABLEVISION RENEWS EFFORTS TO BUY THE YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cablevision Systems Corp., which owns the New York
Knicks and the Rangers, has renewed its effort to buy the New York
Yankees, sweetening the proposal by offering the Yankees' owner,
George Steinbrenner, a hand in running all three teams should he
sell his ball club, associates of Steinbrenner say.
</P>
<P>
   The media and entertainment company has been wooing Steinbrenner
in on-again, off-again talks since November, when it offered $500
million for the baseball team. According to three people involved
with the Yankees organization, all of whom spoke on condition of
anonymity, Cablevision revived the negotiations about three weeks
ago with the new offer.
</P>
<P>
   Cablevision officials said in a statement that it is not their
policy to comment on rumors or speculation, but added that the
company had no plans to relinquish management of the Knicks and
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   But executives close to Steinbrenner said that under the new
proposal, Cablevision, the majority owner of Madison Square Garden,
is offering to buy the Yankees for a combination of stock and cash,
while retaining Steinbrenner as a general partner of the Yankees
with responsibility for running all of the company's sports teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came up with a new angle,'' one person close to
Steinbrenner said. ``George would be chairman of all the sports
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner's associates did not have any further information
about how the deal would be structured, including the details of
Steinbrenner's proposed role.
</P>
<P>
   Cablevision's pursuit of the team reflects a trend in the sports
industry of entertainment companies trying to tie themselves to
sports franchises, which can give them critical sources of
programming. Comcast Communications Corp., for instance, recently
bought the Philadelphia 76ers and the Philadelphia Flyers. Time
Warner Inc. owns the Atlanta Braves, and the Tribune Co. owns the
Chicago Cubs. In January, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. bought the
Los Angeles Dodgers for $311 million, insuring the team's presence
on Murdoch's sports channel in southern California, Fox Sports
West.
</P>
<P>
   If a deal is struck for the Yankees, Charles Dolan, the chairman
of Cablevision, would solidify a monopoly on sports cable telecasts
in the largest metropolitan market in the country and prevent a
rival from obtaining the lucrative cable rights to the Yankees when
the team's current cable contract expires in 2000. MSG Network,
another subsidiary of Cablevision, broadcasts Yankees games.
Steinbrenner, in turn, would become New York's sports czar.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner could not be reached for comment, his spokesman,
Howard Rubenstein, said.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan, an old friend of Steinbrenner's from Cleveland, has not
been shy about his pursuit of the Yankees. But it is far from clear
whether Steinbrenner, who bought the team for $10 million in 1973,
is willing to sell. Last March, he acknowledged meeting with Dolan
to discuss the possibility of Cablevision buying into the Yankees,
but vowed, ``I don't intend to ever let the Yankees go.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued by the company on Tuesday, Cablevision
said: ``We make special note that we have had no discussions to
relinquish either the control or management responsibilities of
Madison Square Garden and its teams and we do not expect to have
any such discussions in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   But two people close to Steinbrenner, who owns 57 percent of the
Yankees, and one person with a minority stake in the team said that
Dolan had made a new offer for the Yankees that would put
Steinbrenner in charge of all three teams, albeit under the
Cablevision umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want him to manage the three teams,'' said one. ``He
hasn't said yes and he hasn't said no.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that a potential sale would have any effect on
Steinbrenner's negotiations with city and state officials over his
desire for a new ball park to replace Yankee Stadium in the Bronx.
Steinbrenner, who has long complained about conditions at the
team's historic stadium, has said he will announce a decision at
the end of this season about a future home for the team, either in
a renovated stadium in the Bronx, or a new one in Manhattan or New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are considered the most valuable team in baseball
not only because of their long, storied history and presence in New
York, but also because their success and fan base has assured a
deep well of revenues from television, radio, and other sources.

AFTER 1,011 GAMES, ARMY JOINS A CONFERENCE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST POINT, N.Y. _ It has played football for 108 years, 1,011
games in all against teams from across the nation. It maintains a
narrow edge over Navy in one of the oldest and most resonant
rivalries in college sports. But the history of Army football takes
a modern turn Saturday when a pair of teams without a victory
square off at Michie Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   When Army (0-1) faces Cincinnati (0-2) here, the Black Knights
will turn the page on more than a century as an independent to
compete in their first game as the newest member of Conference USA.
</P>
<P>
   It is the beginning of an era when FOX SportsNet, new rivals
such as Southern Mississippi and post-season games like the Liberty
Bowl will become part of Army lore along with Glenn Davis and the
Commander-in-Chief's Trophy. In the view of Army athletic
officials, it is vital to remaining in the mainstream of big-time
college football.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows our commitment to playing Division I-A football,''
said Al Vanderbush, Army's athletic director. ``We were playing a
couple of Division I-AA schools and getting criticized for it.
Other schools were using it to recruit against us. This makes us
more competitive, gives us an identity, and I believe kids today
would like to look up and see there is a conference championship to
play for and an all-conference team to make.''
</P>
<P>
   More important, beyond just survival, it shifts Army's focus to
getting a greater share of the millions of television dollars
flowing into college football. Besides a competitive schedule and
the promise of bowl games, Army now gets a marketing outfit _ the
conference _ dedicated to making it network- and cable-ready.
</P>
<P>
   Army is not alone in trying to reposition itself in an
increasingly competitive race for television dollars and bowl
payouts. Last May, the presidents of eight Western universities,
including Air Force, stunned the college athletic community when
they announced they were leaving the Western Athletic Conference to
form their own league.
</P>
<P>
   They cited everything from unmanageable travel _ the conference
stretched from Hawaii to Houston _ to the dilution of geographical
rivalries. But the fact that television and bowl money did not
stretch far when divided by 16 teams was perhaps the clincher.
</P>
<P>
   Even Notre Dame, the only major power among the eight remaining
Division I-A independents, which has its own five-year, $45 million
television contract with NBC, is talking to Big Ten officials about
joining the conference to insure economic health and stability.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in professional sports, the driving factor in this
climate of change is television money. The Big Ten commissioner,
James E. Delany, estimates the annual market for college football
television rights at $300 million and growing.
</P>
<P>
   In the new Bowl Championship Series which ABC will televise, the
title game will be worth from $11 million to $12 million a team.
Jon D. Litner, senior vice president for programming at ABC Sports,
says that like the makers of soft drinks, schools are ``fighting
for shelf space'' and are turning to high-quality marketing and
aggressive representation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an enormous amount of revenue that television
generates,'' Litner said. ``I'm sure schools are making decisions
on who they affiliate with because of television.'' ABC, along with
ESPN under the Disney umbrella, is the biggest player in college
football and will broadcast 21 of 26 post-season games.
</P>
<P>
   Conference USA, in its third year of existence, offered Army
access it did not previously have to a television contract and two
bowl games. It also offered a schedule of mid-major Southern
universities with which Academy officials believed a school of
4,000 cadets _ none on true athletic scholarships _ could compete.
The conference is composed of Cincinnati, Tulane, Memphis,
Louisville, Houston, Southern Miss and East Carolina, and its
champion earns an automatic berth in the Liberty Bowl, which last
year had a $1.1 million payout per team.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Humanitarian Bowl in Boise, Idaho, will hold a
place for another Conference USA team, worth an additional $750,000
to each team. And the conference's deal with Fox SportsNet pays
dividends in exposure _ five Army games are scheduled to be
televised this season and the number could reach nine. Last year,
three Army games were televised, including the Navy game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The television and bowl opportunities are attached exclusively
to the conferences anymore,'' said Army Coach Bob Sutton. ``The
independents out there don't really have a voice. We have a broad
recruiting base in the South that we're going to reach more
effectively. Every game is going to mean something in the
conference standings. Kids are going to see us more and we'll be
validated as a program.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The athletic budget at Army is $15 million, of which $3 million
comes from the government, primarily to cover salaries. Revenue
from football carries the academy's 25 other athletic teams.
Vanderbush said attendance and concessions at Army's home games,
television contracts and donations connected to the football
program account for the vast majority of the remaining $12 million.
Army will continue to play Air Force and Navy for the
Commander-in-Chief's trophy and, in an essential piece of deal
making, did not give up its television rights for the annual
classic against the Midshipmen.
</P>
<P>
   The Army-Navy game, recently renewed by CBS through 2008, is
among the most lucrative in college sports. The previous contract
was worth $1 million a year for both Army and Navy, which remains
an independent, and Vanderbush said that had increased
significantly, although he would not give a figure.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbush, the Army athletic director, said that the Conference
USA affiliation is initially worth an additional $300,000 to
$400,000 a year to Army, though the windfall is largely offset this
year because the Black Knights lost a home game in the switch to
the conference schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Conference USA is part of the Bowl Championship Series, but is
only guaranteed a place in one of the four big-money games _
Fiesta, Rose, Sugar or Orange _ if one of its teams finishes No. 6
or higher in the series' ranking. Still, the conference receives
$800,000 for being a part of the series, according to Mike Slive,
the conference's commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Slive said flatly that Army would make more money in Conference
USA than it would have as an independent. In turn, he said, the
other schools in the conference have acquired a valuable commodity
to bolster their status in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get its storied tradition and great football history, which
helps our name recognition,'' Slive said. ``Contracts and
governance are conference-driven. The revenues are market-driven.
Our goal is to be at the table and be ready to move up and take our
share.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy Kramer, the longtime commissioner of the powerful
Southeastern Conference, anticipates more conference realignment.
Fortunately for Army, it has already made its move. ``My athletic
directors can divide,'' Kramer said. ``And unless you have
something valuable to bring, conferences may get smaller before
they get bigger.'' &QL;

GALVESTON-AREA DAMAGE FROM FRANCES AT LEAST $256 MILLION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KEVIN MORAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GALVESTON, Texas _ Tropical Storm Frances inflicted at least
$256 million damage in Galveston County, more than 10 times the
estimated damage in Houston and Harris County, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The figures, already forwarded to Gov. George W. Bush's office
and state emergency officials, include $164 million in damages to
single-family homes.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of damage to public property exceed $77 million,
including $63 million mainly from erosion of public beaches.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston and Harris County, damage attributed to the storm is
expected to exceed $23 million, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   As authorities continued compiling information about the damage
from Frances, weather experts Wednesday were watching a disturbance
in the southeast Gulf of Mexico, fearing it could turn into a
tropical depression or storm.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service said the system is expected to move
northwest through Monday, spreading showers and gusty winds into
coastal areas from Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle during the
next day or two.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered thunderstorms dumped more water on the saturated
Houston-Galveston area Wednesday and were expected to continue this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nearly 5,000 Galveston County houses known affected by
Frances, 47 were destroyed, 2,719 suffered major damage and 1,756
minor damage, according to county figures. Repair costs on
single-family dwellings alone will top $164 million.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the losses ``staggering,'' county Emergency Management
Coordinator Don Wiseman said state and federal officials would
survey damage in the county on Thursday and Friday to verify
Frances' effects for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Millwee, director of the Texas Office of Emergency
Management, said he hopes to make a recommendation to Bush on a
disaster declaration by Friday. Preliminary figures point toward a
recommendation that Bush declare a disaster and open the way for
federal assistance, Millwee said.
</P>
<P>
   State officials, he said, will concentrate first on needs of
families and individuals, then address damage to public properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get a good snapshot right now of what kind of
people impact it's had, then follow with what kind of
infrastructure impact it's had,'' Millwee said.
</P>
<P>
   A disaster declaration, he said, would make many homeowners
along the coast eligible for Small Business Administration loans to
help restore their properties. Depending on incomes, some
homeowners could qualify for grants not needing to be repaid.
</P>
<P>
   During days of high tides that swamped low-lying areas, an
estimated 8,000 Galveston County homes were isolated at one time or
another.
</P>
<P>
   Agricultural losses, if any, have not been tabulated.
</P>
<P>
   Besides houses in beachfront subdivisions flooded by high tides
or undermined by wind-driven waves, local road systems took a
particular beating from Frances, Wiseman said. Repair costs for
paved roads are estimated at more than $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst damage,'' Wiseman said, ``was to side streets on
Bolivar Peninsula that go back to the bay and to the beach, in the
San Leon and Bacliff areas, and on West Beach on the island, down
around Bermuda Beach and some of the other subdivisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bolivar Peninsula streets that run off of a 30-mile stretch
of Texas 87 are county-owned, as are those in the mainland areas of
San Leon and Bacliff. Most Galveston Island streets damaged by the
storm are maintained by the city of Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   Estimated damage to public buildings and equipment exceeds $4.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Business losses, including five destroyed and 54 damaged, total
an estimated $14.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Millwee said his office, faced with coastal flooding in recent
days and still dealing with a disastrous flood in Del Rio, Texas,
last month, has been operating around the clock recently except for
a brief stint this week.
</P>
<P>
   State officials are worried that the disturbed weather in the
southeastern Gulf could repeat Frances' vicious attack on the upper
Texas coast, Millwee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Coastal Bend area has got our attention because we've had
a number of flash-flood warnings extended there, with some
evacuations reported,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   State and local officials, Millwee said, are already making
plans to respond to another spate of weather similar to that
Frances brought to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we don't need right now,'' he said. &QL;

 New Twist in Trading   By Arthur M. Louis  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
A company called OptiMark Technologies has developed a
supercomputer-driven system designed to let institutional investors
save money by trading anonymously and confidentially.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The system hasn't been put to use yet, but both San Francisco's
Pacific Exchange and the Nasdaq plan to make it available soon to
institutional traders.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific hopes to get the system up and running by the end of
November, while the Nasdaq rollout is slated for next August.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody else has signed on. The other exchanges, most notably the
New York Stock Exchange, have reservations about it. Some are
taking a wait-and-see attitude.
</P>
<P>
   However, Robert Greber, chairman and chief executive of the
Pacific Exchange, is highly optimistic about OptiMark. He figures
that stock trading on the Pacific, currently running at around 20
million shares daily, could at least double after the exchange
installs the OptiMark system.
</P>
<P>
   But OptiMark _ or an OptiMark-type system _ has the potential to
eventually eliminate brokers, floor traders, specialists and other
humans who currently get involved in securities transactions.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not on the agenda for now.
</P>
<P>
   Institutions will still have to designate brokers to clear their
trades and handle credit and other bookkeeping matters, and the
brokers will still get commissions. But the brokers won't learn
about a trade until after it is completed.
</P>
<P>
   OptiMark Technologies _ a privately held, Colorado company with
venture-capital financing from such heavyweights as Goldman Sachs
and Dow Jones _ hopes to solve a problem commonly faced by
institutional investors who want to buy or sell large blocks of
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Often, these investors can't get the prices the want _ or
anything close.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, after they place orders with their brokers, word
leaks out that a block is overhanging the market. Although brokers
are supposed to keep the trader's identity and the size of the
trade confidential, few are noted for tight-lipped discretion.
</P>
<P>
   Prospective buyers who hear about pending orders can take
advantage of big sellers by offering substantially less than the
prevailing market price. Prospective sellers take advantage of big
buyers by boosting their asking prices.
</P>
<P>
   Institutional traders sometimes try to hide the size of a
transaction by parceling big orders among multiple brokers. But
that tactic rarely succeeds: It's just too difficult to keep
secrets on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, experts estimate, institutions lose an average of
60 cents per share on every large trade they make. On Wall Street,
this penalty is known as ``price impact.''
</P>
<P>
   With the system devised by OptiMark, traders would use computer
keyboards to enter the number of shares they want to buy or sell,
and the prices they hope to get.
</P>
<P>
   The supercomputer would match the buy orders with sell orders
for the same stock, and vice versa. The transactions would be
completed automatically, without the intervention of human beings.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Rickard, president of OptiMark Technologies, says his
company's trading system ``maximizes the preferences'' of traders
on both sides of a transaction.
</P>
<P>
   An institution that wants to sell, say, 50,000 shares of XYZ Co.
stock can specify a broad range of acceptable prices for various
pieces of the order.
</P>
<P>
   If the stock is trading around $50 per share, the institution
might indicate that it is willing to sell all 50,000 shares for at
least $50.25 each, only 30,000 shares for $50, only 10,000 shares
for $49.75 and so on.
</P>
<P>
   It also can indicate its degree of satisfaction with each
component of a trade. For example, it may be 100 percent satisfied
to trade shares at $50.25, 80 percent satisfied to trade at $50,
and 30 percent satisfied to trade at $49.75.
</P>
<P>
   If the stock is at a price where the institution is willing to
trade at least part of its block, the computer will check when the
order was entered. If no other trader posted an order earlier, and
if the institution is as satisfied with the price as any other
trader, the deal will go through.
</P>
<P>
   The OptiMark system will scan all pending orders every 90
seconds, making many billions of calculations during that time to
match buyers and sellers.
</P>
<P>
   In making trades, OptiMark will draw not only on orders entered
directly into the system, but also on orders placed with
specialists on the floor of the Pacific Exchange and orders placed
on other exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   OptiMark will track orders on the other exchanges through the
Intermarket Trading System, a price-monitoring network created 20
years ago by an act of Congress. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   OptiMark will furnish institutional traders all the hardware and
software they need without charge, but the traders will have to pay
the company one cent for each share they buy or sell through the
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a lot compared with today's 60-cent price impact,''
says Greber.
</P>
<P>
   Brokerage firms, which could become an endangered species as
automated trading systems proliferate, aren't eager to discuss the
subject. Spokesmen for Merrill Lynch and PaineWebber declined to
comment for this article.
</P>
<P>
   Institutional traders, who stand to benefit most from OptiMark,
are more willing to chat.
</P>
<P>
   John Russell, a trader with Franklin Resources, the San Mateo
mutual-fund company, attended training sessions sponsored by
OptiMark, and says the system ``definitely promises the ability to
make better transactions.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Brooks, vice president and head of equity trading with
Maryland's T. Rowe Price fund group, calls OptiMark ``a very
interesting concept _ we are prepared to use it.''
</P>
<P>
   But he notes that there can be times when institutional traders
don't want anonymity or confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be times when I want to show my hand, to
attract the other side of a transaction,'' Brooks remarks. ``I may
be interested in buying some crazy little stock that doesn't trade
much, and I will want some broker to go out looking and turn up a
seller for me. If I'm anonymous, I might get nothing done.''
</P>
<P>
   One possible fly in the OptiMark ointment is the New York Stock
Exchange, the majority of whose 1,500 members are floor traders and
specialists. It has traditionally dragged its feet when it comes to
automation, because it doesn't want to put its members out of work.
</P>
<P>
   The NYSE was approached by OptiMark, but declined to use the
OptiMark system on the Big Board. It also is insisting on rules
that conceivably could discourage the use of OptiMark on the
Pacific Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   It is demanding that orders routed from the Pacific to the Big
Board via OptiMark must be processed manually by specialists. It
says this is required by the rules governing the Intermarket
Trading System.
</P>
<P>
   If this view prevails, ``it would degrade the quality of the
market,'' Rickard says.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is under consideration by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, which already has approved OptiMark's trading
system in principal. The SEC is expected to rule on the matter
within a month.

 Spicy Tell-All Has Microsoft Smoking Mad   By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
The Starr report isn't the only salacious tome about a powerful guy
named Bill and a cigar.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Microsoft File,'' a new book about the software giant and
leader Bill Gates, is raising nearly as much ruckus as Kenneth
Starr's tell-all.
</P>
<P>
   Author Wendy Goldman Rohm says the 294-page book is a serious
work based on years of research into the tech behemoth, hundreds of
interviews and thousands of government documents.
</P>
<P>
   It reveals how Microsoft all but squashed competition in the PC
operating-system market and threatens to do the same with the
Internet. The book is chock full of detail explaining how Microsoft
deeply damaged competitors such as Novell Inc., Netscape
Communications Corp., Sun Microsystems Inc. and Go Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Spicing up laborious discussions of per-processor licensing and
DR-DOS technology, however, are scenes such as this one describing
a dinner Bill Gates allegedly had with a prostitute around the time
of a Federal Trade Commission probe in 1991:
</P>
<P>
   ``She was beautiful. It hardly mattered that she was paid,''
Rohm writes, describing the encounter.
</P>
<P>
   And there is this pearl about Gates and Microsoft General
Counsel William Neukom dueling over Stefanie Reichel, a Microsoft
executive in Germany, at a luxurious London restaurant: `` `At my
sailing club, men and women alike smoke cigars,' Reichel said,
keeping up the social banter. `I like them myself.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Neukom grinned some more. `I bet you like cigars,' he said.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend that the book's more-sensational episodes are
intended to enliven an otherwise plodding narrative and that
passages delving into Gates' thoughts are clearly fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Rohm vehemently defended those accounts, saying they are
accurate accounts of events that took place in public that were
relayed to her by confidantes of Gates'.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``This is a historical account of Gates' misuse of monopoly
power over the past decade,'' Rohm said in an interview yesterday
at The Chronicle. ``It was a win-at-all-cost, free-market-be-damned
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives, she added, ``are ethically quite
marginal.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, officials of Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft are
furious with the kiss-and-tell nature of the book and its charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``During a summer of questionable journalism, this stands out as
one of the more troubling installments,'' said Microsoft spokesman
Greg Shaw. ``The book is riddled with errors, and there was an
11th-hour, insincere effort to get our reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Rohm counters that she interviewed Microsoft officials dozens of
times during the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft declined to comment on whether it will pursue legal
action.

CLINTON'S FAME   HAS CURRENCY,   SURVEY REVEALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ President Clinton on a dollar bill?
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, he's the preference among Americans who want to
see a new face on their currency, according to a recent telephone
survey sponsored by the Visa/Plus ATM Network. Clinton was the top
choice for 10 percent of respondents, topping Ronald Reagan at 9
percent, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. at 8 percent and John F.
Kennedy at 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The survey _ the seventh such poll by the credit-card issuer _
was taken after Aug. 17, when Clinton admitted his affair with
Monica Lewinsky. His leading spot may reflect the fact that the
president's job-approval ratings have remained high throughout the
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's not much sentiment for any change since only 10
percent of 1,008 respondents want to replace George Washington on
the dollar bill, down from 14 percent last year and 67 percent five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally feel that the current pictures on the currency
are more than sufficient,'' said Stanley Myron Handleman, a
resident of Woodland Hills, a suburb approximately 25 miles
northwest of downtown Los Angeles. ``I think they're beautiful. I
don't think changing the currency should be our first priority
ahead of doing something to help the homeless, but if we had to
change I'd want Dr. King because of his message of nonviolence.''
</P>
<P>
   Anna Varnon of Burbank, a suburb 11 miles northwest of Los
Angeles, said she supported the idea of replacing faces with
national symbols. ``George Washington had slaves and raised
tobacco; he was the founding father of cancer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see things that really represent America like
the Golden Gate Bridge and the Empire State Building, something
that demonstrates how Americans work together,'' she added. ``I
think that would bring us together much more than sending a team to
the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the $1 bill is likely to be changed sometime in 2001.
The U.S. Treasury Department announced three years ago it would
redesign the country's currency with the goals of preventing
counterfeiting and making the bills easier to read. Since then, it
has issued new $100 and $50 bills _ although it kept the portraits
of Benjamin Franklin and Ulysses Grant, respectively _ and will
issue new $20 bills next week.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Bureau of Printing and Engraving said no
final decision had yet been made on issuing a new $1 bill.
</P>
<P>
   As for Clinton replacing Washington on the dollar bill,
screenwriter Walter Klenhard noted Washington is known for
admitting to his father that he chopped down a favorite cherry tree
and added, ``if Clinton were in the middle of a bunch of tree
stumps, he'd be saying, `I have no idea how this happened.'''
</P>
<P>
   Klenhard also suggested that Clinton be portrayed on a $3 bill
with the corners occupied by Lewinsky, Gennifer Flowers, Paula
Jones and Kathleen Willey.

 HipBone Connects Web Users   By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
One of the best-kept secrets on the Internet resides in a
greenhouse tucked away in the Los Altos hills.
<TEXT>
<P>
   There, a small startup has developed free software that lets
surfers ``co-navigate'' the Web together _ to shop, date and house
hunt, for example. HipBone Software's Co-navigator allows up to 10
people throughout the world to simultaneously move from site to
site.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a Michigan resident recently found an apartment in
San Francisco by cruising rental sites with a Bay Area friend. A
bicoastal couple could plan a vacation together by surfing airline
and hotel Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the next step in visual interaction,'' said Dan Rolla,
co-founder and vice president of business development at HipBone.
``Co-navigator gives people an alternative to the static nature of
chat rooms. You can now explore the Web together.''
</P>
<P>
   Heady stuff for a startup whose initial funding came from one
co-founder who won $75,000 in a Java programming competition in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The prize money gave Mark Tacchi _ who at the time worked with
Rolla at NeXT Software of Redwood City _ the financial independence
to realize a dream of starting a high-tech venture. Both had
discussed the idea of opening a fast-food restaurant that served
health food.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Eventually, they decided to create a product that extended
online communications beyond chat rooms, instant messaging and solo
surfing.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-1997, Tacchi was on a Hawaii beach, relaxing and trying
to come up with a company name. ``I kept thinking of things like
`Mermaid,' '' said Tacchi, HipBone's vice president of engineering.
``I was drawing blanks.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until he literally stumbled over a book on multimedia
technology titled, ``Mbone,'' that Tacchi came up with the name
HipBone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has many meanings: cool, joined at the hip, `IP' (Internet
protocol) is in the middle, the phrase `the hip bone is connected
to the whatever bone.' And it perfectly described the technology,''
he said. ``I immediately went to InterNIC (the Internet service
that registers domain names) and found that the Web address was not
taken. I yelled, `Yes!' ''
</P>
<P>
   He and Rolla soon heard ``Yes'' from Michael Baird, the author
of ``Engineering Your Start-up: A Guide for the Hi-Tech
Entrepreneur,'' whom they had contacted for advice on writing a
business plan.
</P>
<P>
   Baird was so enamored with their idea that he signed on as chief
financial officer in January, and the company was formed. Baird
even bought a $700,000 house in Los Altos to double as company
headquarters. A greenhouse in the back yard is where HipBone's five
employees _ CEO Jim Swanson and Chief Technology Officer Charlie
Graham joined later _ run the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're blooming something different here,'' Baird said.
</P>
<P>
   The firm is talking with several unnamed portal companies about
licensing its co-navigator technology and is likely to pursue
advertising deals on its site, according to Swanson.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; So far, more than 20,000 people have used the free service
since it debuted last month.
</P>
<P>
   Co-navigator ( &LR; www.hipbone.com &LR; ) is free, easy to use and does
not require downloading of software.
</P>
<P>
   To register as a ``host,'' all you need to do is fill out an
electronic template with your name, age, sex, ZIP code, e-mail
address and favorite Jell-O flavor. (Hey, it's a quirky Silicon
Valley startup.) You then are asked to type in a one-word ID.
</P>
<P>
   Up to nine other people can log on as guests of a registered
user to surf the Web as a group. Users communicate through a
separate instant-messaging service, which is widely available and
free.
</P>
<P>
   Be warned, however: HipBone is not yet Mac compatible and it
requires versions 4.0 or higher of either Microsoft Internet
Explorer or Netscape Communicator.
</P>
<P>
   So far, consumers who have used HipBone's product like what they
see.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friend Mark in Washington, D.C., goes shopping for freeware
with me online about 12 hours a week,'' said Barbara Ciampo, 35, of
Alton, N.H. ``When one of us finds an interesting site, we go
hipping (short for HipBone) together.''
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Colston, a social worker and writer in Pryor, Okla., plans
to use HipBone to teach monthly classes on how to surf online
( &LR; pryoronline.com &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   Tacchi himself planned a date using HipBone.
</P>
<P>
   He and his date went online to choose a movie (``The Truman
Show,'' starring Jim Carrey) and a restaurant for dinner. Later,
they co-navigated movie sites for more information on Carrey.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will fundamentally change the way people use the Web,''
Rolla said. ``Surfing the Web will no longer be a lonely
experience. People can now surf the Web together.''

 Poll on Visas for Foreign Professionals Is Bad Timing for
High  Tech   By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
There's nothing like a last-minute poll to gum up the works in
Congress. Yesterday, a labor group used this time-honored tactic to
slow down one of the high-tech lobby's most prominent initiatives.
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the eve of a vote on increasing the number of foreign
professionals that high-tech firms can hire, the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers released a poll showing that
82 percent of Americans oppose the controversial measure.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The poll lands a late blow to high tech's hopes of winning
House passage this week of the H-1B visa bill. The Senate already
HAS signed off on a similar measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing certainly worked out for us,'' said Paul Kostek,
new president of the IEEE, which represents U.S. engineers, who
feel the foreign temps depress their wages and take their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The IEEE poll was conducted by Louis Harris and Associates,
which asked 1,000 randomly selected adults whether Congress should
``allow U.S. companies to sponsor 190,000 additional foreign
technical workers as temporary employees for up to six years.''
</P>
<P>
   Presented with this question, 82 percent said no. And 61 percent
of the sample said they weren't swayed by the tech industry's
claims that U.S. firms would fall behind their international
competitors if they weren't allowed to hire more foreign temps.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Dee Beall, a lobbyist for Hewlett-Packard Co., downplayed
the poll results. She noted that the pollsters admitted that only
14 percent of those surveyed were aware of the H-1B issue before
they were approached for the survey.
</P>
<P>
   That means the questions, and how they were asked, influenced
their responses, she said.

<P>
   As labor and high tech fan out on the Hill to spin the poll
results, tech execs are still trying to remove a White House veto
threat.
</P>
<P>
   TechNet's Democratic strategist, Wade Randlett, who was in the
White House last week lobbying on this issue, said he's still
hopeful a compromise can be worked out to solve administration
fears that foreign temps would replace U.S. workers.
</P>
<P>
   A House Judiciary spokesman said a vote on the H-1B bill was
scheduled for late today _ even though there has been no official
compromise with the White House.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Starr watch: &LR;  Randlett told my colleague, Peninsula columnist
Mark Simon, that he was actually in the White House last Friday
when the Starr report landed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The higher up you went in the White House, the calmer it
was,'' he said. ``There was a sort of an eye of the storm feeling
that people had seen the worst, they believed, and they were now
going to go out and do their jobs. Outside the eye of the storm, it
was just chaotic, especially on the Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Quiet man:  &LR; Representative Tom Campbell (R-Campbell) has a
reputation for being one of Congress's more thoughtful members, so
it was noteworthy when he issued a statement yesterday supporting
the Justice Department's antitrust case against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether the case the department has alleged ultimately proves
successful in court or not, the Department of Justice is on very
solid antitrust ground,'' Campbell wrote.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Just so we wouldn't think his was the voice of Sonny Bono
speaking from beyond the grave, Campbell listed his legal
credentials: former antitrust enforcer for the Federal Trade
Commission, professor of law at Stanford, member of the American
Bar Association's antitrust division, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft spokesman Mark Murray said his company respects
Campbell but is puzzled by his statement. Campbell devoted most of
his statement to discussing the illegality of tying two products
together. But in June, a Court of Appeals decision rejected much of
the government's tying allegations, Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many legal scholars think that greatly undermined the
government's case,'' said Murray, adding, ``The facts and the law
are on our side.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Lower standards? &LR;  It's getting down and dirty in the trade
magazine scene. People at competing publications have been
whispering that the Industry Standard, IDG's new weekly, has had
trouble selling ads and would be cutting its frequency _ not to
mention jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Standard publisher John Battelle was fuming when I called to
discuss this, perhaps because the version of the rumor that reached
his ears called for IDG to give him the boot.
</P>
<P>
   Totally wrong, Battelle said of the rumors. The Standard will
resume weekly publication next week, after a planned summer
slowdown to biweekly frequency; it plans to boost its paid
circulation from 60,000 to 100,000; it is adding 10 people to its
16-person staff; and it it has hired the Hampel Stephanides agency
to launch a ``substantial'' blast of print and online ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``These rumors are coming from competitors who know we have a
campaign coming and are hoping to do advance deterioration of our
brand,'' he said.

STARS HAVE LEADERS WITHOUT LETTERS ON SWEATERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VAIL, Colo. _ Ken Hitchcock just couldn't resist giving a verbal
jab to Brett Hull.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey Hully,'' the Stars' coach shouted over morning coffee
yesterday. ``We had our captain's meeting, and we only spent about
two hours talking about how we're going to deal with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull just laughed and fired his comeback: ``Hey, did they
discuss everything on that list of concerns I sent in with them?''
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull might be able to stop being a captain, but he likely
can't stop being a leader. The superstar winger, who signed a
three-year, $17 million free-agent deal with the Stars over the
summer, is fitting in just fine with new linemates Mike Modano and
Jere Lehtinen on the ice. And so far, he's doing a pretty good job
off the ice, too.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being one of the most outspoken players in the NHL and a
former captain with the St. Louis Blues, Hull will not be one of
the five players given a share of the Stars' five-man captaincy.
Instead, he'll have to be part of what Hitchcock is calling ``the
support group'' _ a handful of players who will be expected to lead
in a quieter role.
</P>
<P>
   All of which, Hitchcock said, makes the 1998-99 season one in
which leadership boundaries have to be reformed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come into these situations and you assume you're
going to have the old chemistry back, that's the wrong
assumption,'' he said. ``It has to be different. We have different
people at different focal points in their careers. We have to adapt
to that.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Hull, the Stars have five former captains on
their team _ Joe Nieuwendyk (Calgary Flames), Pat Verbeek (Hartford
Whalers), Guy Carbonneau (Montreal Canadiens), Brian Skrudland
(Florida Panthers) and Mike Keane (Canadiens). Only Nieuwendyk is
part of the captaincy team _ captain Derian Hatcher and alternate
captains Mike Modano, Craig Ludwig, Sergei Zubov and Nieuwendyk.
</P>
<P>
   That captain's group is intact from last season, but the input
of Keane and Skrudland (acquired in a March trade) and Hull in July
make this a new locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great situation,'' Hull said. ``You have great
leaders who might not say as much but lead on the ice. And then you
have guys like Luds and Carbo who a player can go to and say, `Hey,
can you tell the coaches this.' Different people lead in different
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   And Hull is not without his style. He often jabbers on the ice
or on the bench. He's generally a cut-up in the locker room. He'll
often address leaguewide concerns in the media. And that's kind of
given him a bad reputation as a busybody who might have his nose
too deep in management's business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past four years, it seems, I've had the worst
reputation,'' Hull said. ``And I don't think any of it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, despite Hitchcock's ribbing, he believes that Hull will
fit into the Stars' leadership picture perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk is not so much in Brett Hull, the risk is can the
guys who have been captains and been leaders on other teams, can
they come in and be strong support people for the leaders who wear
the letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw him at the World Cup (in 1996), and we saw at the
highest competition level that Brett Hull was equal to the task and
probably better than most,'' Hitchcock added. ``He's a good player
in a good atmosphere, and we think that atmosphere is here. But
he's in a support group as far as leadership goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is just fine with Brett Hull.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it this way,'' he said. ``It's just like a bunch of
friends talking.''

 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans closed ranks on Wednesday and
pushed closer toward releasing a videotape of President Clinton's
grand jury testimony about his affair with Monica Lewinsky, despite
Democratic objections and private warnings from some in their own
ranks that the release of more sexually explicit material could
backfire politically.
</P>
<P>
   In a closed meeting of House Republicans, Rep. Nancy Johnson of
Connecticut, a moderate, raised concerns, echoed by some other
party centrists and conservatives, about disclosures of irrelevant,
salacious material. In addition to the videotape of the president's
testimony, Ms. Johnson said she was concerned about the graphic
material contained in audio tapes and other evidence that Kenneth
Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, has turned over to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   While these views are still a minority opinion in House
Republican ranks, the dissent underscores the political risks that
may be faced by House leaders in making public the most graphic
details of an 18-month affair between a White House intern and the
President of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the details aren't necessary, we don't need to drag
ourselves and our children through that,'' Ms. Johnson said in an
interview after the meeting. However, she added that she would
support the decision of the Judiciary Committee, which is to vote
on Thursday on whether to disclose the materials. Lawmakers have
said Clinton's videotape could be released as early as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But Speaker Newt Gingrich, according to some lawmakers at the
meeting, seemed irritated by Ms. Johnson's remarks and won a huge
ovation after reminding legislators that the House had voted
overwhelmingly last week to make virtually all the material public,
and that to pull back now would only lead to unauthorized leaks to
news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Ticking off the accusations against the president in the Starr
report, Gingrich told House Republicans that if the allegations are
true, Clinton's actions are those of ``a misogynist,'' according to
lawmakers who attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Despite objections from both parties, as well as public opinion
polls indicating that Americans, by a 2-1 margin, consider the
release of Clinton's videotaped testimony unnecessary, the House
Republican leadership is forging ahead to disclose thousands of
pages of documents and other material.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Gingrich and his top lieutenants are challenging
the views of most Americans that grand jury testimony is sacrosanct
and that the explicit details of a sexual liaison are a private
matter, not fit for public display.
</P>
<P>
   Late on Wednesday afternoon, the House Republican leadership
dispatched three influential legislators to appear at a news
conference to justify the release of Clinton's taped testimony and
other sensitive material.
</P>
<P>
   They cited the precedent of making public eight hours of
videotaped testimony that President Ronald Reagan gave in the
federal trial of Adm. John Poindexter, his former national security
adviser, in connection with the Iran-Contra affair. Moreover, they
said, Clinton and his lawyers have not objected to the release of
the videotape.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to have the right any juror would have, and that is
to judge the credibility of witnesses by watching them,'' said Rep.
Christopher Cox, R-Calif., who served in the White House counsel's
office during the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   The House's 363-63 vote last week to make public all information
except irrelevant material that could hurt innocent parties was a
strong, bipartisan mandate, said Rep. Gerald B.H. Solomon of New
York, who heads the Rules Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Rep. Anne Northup of Kentucky said that keeping the
material confidential would be worse than releasing it. ``What are
the alternatives: spin, interpretations and partial releases?'' Ms.
Northup asked. ``That would create a dynamic that slows the process
down.''
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats have accused Republicans of rushing to make
embarrassing videotape images of the president public, and of being
hypocritical in wanting to release sexually graphic material they
have fought hard to bar from cyberspace and the nation's airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Republicans are going to have to come to grips
with some of their positions like trying to protect the Internet
from language and images that they felt were just objectionable and
pornographic,'' said Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Ms. Johnson, some other Republicans also
expressed concern that the material be carefully sifted. ``I would
hope that they cut out information that hurts innocent bystanders,
and also the dirty stuff,'' said Rep. Amo Houghton Jr. of New York.
``We don't need it. We've got the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   But most Republicans, who have the votes to force disclosure,
insist that the material would help the public decide whether
Clinton had lied under oath.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the increasingly bitter partisan jousting, both
parties said that senior aides on the Judiciary Committee were
waging a behind-the-scenes battle over what materials to expunge.
Democrats were trying to block materials they considered salacious
and embarrassing to the president, while Republicans, who have the
votes to force disclosure, were pushing to release as much as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of Capitol Hill, Senate Democrats chimed in
that House Republicans were taking an inquiry that could lead to
impeachment proceedings and turning it into a partisan attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've seen today again in the House is anything but
fair,'' said Sen. Thomas Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic
leader.

 WASHINGTON: or censure.  
(mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   American officials are clearly worried about the fallout if
Brazil, one of America's largest trading partners, is hit full
force by the economic contagion caused by the flight of investors
from emerging markets worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, testifying Wednesday, was cautious discussing Brazil,
saying that it ``is obviously enormously important to this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been very focused on this, actually,'' he said, ``for
quite some time, and particularly over the course of the past week.
I think it is probably premature to comment on specifics other than
to assure you that this has been the subject of intense focus
through last week, the weekend, and up to the current moment.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Brazilian caution before a presidential election,
the nation's problems are fed by the fear of a renewed attack on
the currency as investors continue to flee emerging markets and
worries that the IMF's emergency reserves must be carefully
conserved.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian officials say they have not asked the IMF for direct
help. But on Tuesday night, the finance minister, Pedro Malan, said
that his government was talking to the IMF and the Group of Seven
countries about ways to bolster the confidence of investors. He
hinted that the IMF would put together a line of credit, probably
more than $25 billion, that Brazil and its neighbors could draw on
to defend their currencies and pay their international debts.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday morning, hours after President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso talked to Clinton by telephone in a discussion that neither
government described in detail, Malan backed away. ``It is not for
Brazil to speak for the IMF or any G-7 country or make comments on
the terms, volumes and conditions upon which international
cooperation could or would be made available to countries if the
need arises,'' he said. Other officials said that there had not
been any discussion of the size of the package.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was out ahead of himself,'' one person close to the
negotiations said, insisting on anonymity, ``but he wasn't entirely
blowing smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Malan, much like officials in Thailand and Korea late last year,
may have been dangling the possibility of international help to
encourage the recent run-up in the Brazilian stock market _ which
could help stave off the need for help. He did not discuss the
conditions that Brazil would have to meet in return for the
commitment of backup financing because they are likely to create
trouble for Cardoso as his re-election campaign enters its final
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF, officials say, would insist that Brazil cut its huge
budget deficit, which currently runs about 7 percent of the
country's gross domestic product. That would mean pushing cuts in
social programs or military spending through a notoriously
undisciplined Congress, a task that the government would prefer to
tackle after the elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very, very slow mating dance,'' said an official
involved in the discussions. ``The Brazilians don't want to
acknowledge that they need help, but they also don't want to risk a
meltdown of their economy in the next few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Putting together a rescue package would almost certainly involve
committing to use the last $15 billion left in the IMF's
``emergency fuel tank,'' a fund called the general agreement to
borrow. It is essentially a loan from the world's major economies,
which used the same fund in July in a failed effort to prop up
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has used only $4.8 billion of the money it was promised,
but billions more are committed to Moscow should it meet the IMF's
conditions of collecting more taxes and keeping the money supply
under control. So far, the new Russian government, appointed just
days ago, appears to be moving in the opposite direction.

 &HT;    On deck: Arizona Diamondbacks
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: Tonight, Friday and Saturday at 10:05 p.m.; Sunday at
4:05(cq) p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   TV/radio: TBS and 750-AM will broadcast all four games.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: Tonight, LHP Denny Neagle (14-11,
3.69; 0-0, 7.50 lifetime vs. Diamondbacks) vs. LHP Omar Daal (7-11,
2.78; 1-2, 4.87 lifetime vs. Braves). Friday, RHP Greg Maddux
(17-8, 2.15; first appearance vs. Diamondbacks) vs. RHP Andy Benes
(13-13, 4.24; 4-12, 3.69 lifetime vs. Braves). Saturday, LHP Tom
Glavine (19-6, 2.63; 2-0, 1.29 lifetime vs. Diamondacks) vs. LHP
Brian Anderson (12-12, 4.34; 0-0, 9.00 lifetime vs. Braves).
Sunday, LHP Bruce Chen (1-0, 5.79; first appearance vs.
Diamondbacks) vs. RHP Amaury Telemaco (6-9, 3.92; 1-1, 3.29
lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Series history: The Braves have won all five games with the
expansion Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Past meetings: The Braves swept a three-game series in late
April at Turner Field. John Smoltz won his second game of the year
on April 22, getting homers from Javy Lopez and Michael Tucker in a
5-2 win. An Andres Galarraga homer the next night helped Tom
Glavine to a 3-1 win. Galarraga homered again the following night
in Atlanta's 6-5 win. Three days later, the scene shifted from the
Ted to the Bob. Atlanta again scored in the ninth for a 6-5 victory
before Glavine easily beat Arizona 12-2 with help from homers by
Lopez and Ryan Klesko.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks leaders: Avg.- Andy Fox (.288). RBI Devon White
(83). HR White (21). SB White (21). W Andy Benes (13). ERA Omar
Daal (2.78). SV Gregg Olson (28).
</P>
<P>
   Quickly: Their inaugural season is ending up not-too-shabbily
for the D-Backs. After losing a three-game series to Cincinnati to
open the second half, Arizona has gone 30-30. The Diamondbacks have
won 60 games and, with three more wins, will avoid a 100-loss
maiden season. If they can win seven of their last 11 games,
they'll tie Colorado's record for most wins by an NL expansion team
with 67...Andy Benes took a no-hitter into the ninth inning Sunday
in Cincinnati before it was broken up after 8-1/3 innings. Still,
Benes and Brian Anderson have a chance to become just the third
pair of starters on expansion teams to post double-figure wins and
a .500 or better record...The D-Back opened their current homestand
with a 14-2 pounding of San Francisco in which Arizona ripped a
club-record 17 hits. The record-breaker: a Yamil Benitez hit that
touched a girder inside the Bob, 190 above field level...Arizona
leads the majors with 45 triples and, after an 11-inning, 7-6 win
over the Giants Tuesday, is 54-31 when scoring a least four runs.
In low-scoring games, though, the D-Backs are 7-60 when scoring
three or less...Sunday's game time has been changed from 9:05 p.m.
EDT to 6:05 to allow local Arizona residents to watch baseball in
the afternoon, then the NFL Arizona Cardinals that evening.
</P>
<P>
   Who's hot: Devon White has 21 homers and 21 stolen bases to
become the first expansion player to reach the 20-20 plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Who's not: Karim Garcia was 3-for-35 before going 3-for-5 in the
14-2 rout of San Francisco.

 &HT;    Ticket sales KO doubts for Holyfield
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Considered by some to be a weak box-office attraction, Evander
Holyfield smiled when asked about the possibility of a sold-out
Georgia Dome for Saturday's fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love it,'' he said, ``because then I could say, `I can't
draw? What do you mean I can't draw?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the bout with Vaughn Bean doesn't sell out the 42,000
seats at the Dome, it is securing a place in boxing history. With
about 25,000 tickets sold, the crowd is assured of being the
largest to view a heavyweight title fight since the Muhammad
Ali-Leon Spinks rematch in 1978, which drew 63,350 to the Superdome
in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy the people decided to show up,'' said Holyfield, who
will add about $1.5 million in gate incentives to his $3.5 million
minimum purse. ``Now I know I won't lose any money.''
</P>
<P>
   BEAN VS. HOLYFIELD
</P>
<P>
   When/where: Saturday at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   TV: Showtime, 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Undercard: 13 preliminary bouts, the first expected to start at
5:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket update: Seats are priced at $500, $300, $150, $75, $50,
$35 and $25 and are available at Ticketmaster and the Dome box
office.

 &HT;    Adultery claim hits GOP as Starr report vote looms
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr and Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Judiciary Committee is expected to vote
today in closed session to make public more than four hours of
testimony President Clinton gave last month to a federal grand jury
convened by independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   With Democrats loudly protesting, Republican committee members
say the tapes could be aired as early as this afternoon or Friday,
depending on the committee's ability to iron out the logistics.
</P>
<P>
   But the committee may have more to iron out than just logistics.
</P>
<P>
   Salon magazine published a story Wednesday laying out an
adulterous affair that Illinois Republican Henry Hyde, the widely
respected chairman of the Judiciary panel, had with a Chicago woman
30 years ago. The story quoted the spurned husband of Hyde's lover
saying, ``This hypocrite broke up my family.''
</P>
<P>
   That disclosure sparked a maelstrom on Capitol Hill, with
Republicans charging that the source of the report was the White
House. Democrats fought back, saying the GOP shouldn't being
casting stones when they live in glass houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad that the president's attack dogs don't know the
difference between breaking the law and making a mistake decades
ago,'' said House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas).
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Republican Rep. Bob Barr went one step further. Barr
said if the White House generated the story about Hyde, it would
constitute a felony crime of obstructing Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that anyone can say with a straight face that
this is a coincidence,'' said Barr. ``It may be an effort to thwart
the Judiciary Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Admitting he had the affair, Hyde said in a statement that ``the
statute of limitations has long since passed on my youthful
indiscretions.'' Hyde was 41 at the time of the affair.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to bring bipartisan decorum to a polarized
committee, Hyde told reporters he would do whatever it took to make
the impeachment process a fair one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will do everything including bend over backwards to retain,
nourish and strengthen our bipartisan consensus, if there is one,''
Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   The top priority of Republicans, though, is to make public as
soon as possible the 2,600 pages and 17 boxes of material now under
lock and key in the Gerald R. Ford House Office Building.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are resisting this effort, saying the intent is to
humiliate the president further. They point out that public opinion
polls show Americans by a 2-to-1 ratio are against releasing the
tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's shocking and shameful that House Republicans, the
self-declared party of family values, are so determined to peddle
this smut to an unwilling and disgusted American public,'' said Jim
Jordan, spokesman for the Democratic side of the Judiciary
Committee. ``These are, after all, the same members who have spoken
so forcefully and eloquently about the dangers of pornography to
children put up on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans urged a more cautious approach to releasing the
tapes and other material.
</P>
<P>
   At a closed meeting of Republican House members Wednesday
morning, Rep. Nancy Johnson (R-Conn.) voiced some reservations
about the release of more salacious material from Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's necessary to repeat the details,
particularly with respect to the intimate activity between those
two,'' Johnson said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) said the House already
had voted to release to the public all relevant material in Starr's
submission, several members who attended the meeting said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was to the point and he was absolutely 100 percent right,''
said Rep. Scott McInnis (R-Colo.).
</P>
<P>
   But South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham, a member of the
Judiciary panel, said he is tired of being told what to do by party
leaders. Deciding what details should be made public is the purview
of the Judiciary Committee, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't let Newt drive my train,'' said Graham, who has bucked
the leadership in the past. ``I don't care what the speaker says I
should do.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham and others contend the American public has been inundated
with the salacious details and that the 2,600 pages of back-up
material should be carefully looked at in private to protect
innocent people who were questioned by the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Michael Castle of Delaware, a Republican moderate, said
other moderate Republicans have debated the wisdom of releasing
Clinton's videotaped testimony. ``The concern is whether it's
overkill,'' Castle said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Matt Salmon, an Arizona Republican who favors release of
the videotape, said he agrees with Democrats who contend it would
be wrong for Republicans to use snippets from the tape in campaign
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to get a guarantee somehow from candidates that they
are not going to use it for campaign purposes,'' Salmon said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Hobson (R-Ohio) said he cannot understand Democratic
objections to the tape's release since the president's lawyers must
have been aware of its existence and would have known it would
eventually find its way to the public in the supercharged
atmosphere of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing we can figure is that they're looking for a
partisan fight on something,'' Hobson said.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats say it is unfair to release the tapes. ``What's
fair?'' asked Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.). ``Rather than let this
turn into a political thing, we should address the substance of
what is being alleged. I am against any information now under lock
and key from being dumped on the American public.''
</P>
<P>
   As lawyers on both sides of the Judiciary Committee met late
Wednesday evening to discuss details of the material that will be
kept private, fear spread that the Salon story is just the
beginning of more stories about Republicans having affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Democrats made charges, never substantiated,
against Republicans on the House ethics committee, which she
chaired during its investigation of Gingrich's use of tax-exempt
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she believes Democrats are behind the Salon story, she
said, ``I am absolutely certain. You bet I am.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of this is to chill people from doing their
constitutional duty,'' added Rep. Anne Northrup (R-Ky.), making a
vague reference to the investigative efforts of ``1600 Pennsylvania
Avenue.''

   ATLANTA -- Salon Magazine (http://www.salonmagazine.com), the
Web-only journal of politics, arts and ideas, is widely regarded as
one of the Web's best online publications. Luminaries such as
writer Camille Paglia and pubic radio personality Garrison Keillor
are regular contributors. The magazine's weekly feature ``Mothers
Who Think'' is required reading for not only wired moms, but women
who think all over the Web. Salon resembles ''Vanity Fair'' or
''The New Yorker'' in the scope and tone of its articles. Recent
feature topics have ranged from Courtney Love to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Monica Lewinsky story broke in January, Salon has been
scrambling, with a good measure of success, to be taken seriously
in political coverage. Salon has broken its fair share of stories
during the nine-month course of the Lewinsky scandal. Its coverage
even landed reporter Jonathan Broder a spot on NBC's ``Meet the
Press,'' where he was treated as a legitimate member of the working
press, unlike Matt Drudge, the quasi-journalist who last filled the
cyberspace chair on the Sunday morning news program.
</P>
<P>
   In much of its coverage of the scandal, Salon has attacked
independent counsel Ken Starr. So much so, that an unsigned
editorial that accompanies the Henry Hyde story goes out of its way
to say that the White House had nothing to do with the story. And
it reminds readers that Salon has also been critical of the White
House: ``Although we have been an outspoken critic of Kenneth
Starr's investigation, we are not a 'pro-Clinton' publication. We
have attacked Clinton from the left, right and center. Indeed, one
of our editors has called in these pages for his resignation.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the editorial, Salon published the story ``to bring
this entire sordid conflict'' to a head. ``Does the fact that Henry
Hyde engaged in an adulterous affair, and tried to keep it hidden
from his family and constitutents, mean he is not fit to hold
public office? Absolutely not. And the same is true of President
Clinton.''

 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Kansas City coach Marty Schottenheimer listened for a
while last week as a few of his staffers bemoaned the Chiefs' list
of injured starters before interrupting an assistant in
midsentence.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of injury epidemic, he reminded them, is simply a part
of the game. The fact Kansas City is missing half its defensive
line, a standout guard, its starting quarterback and a wide
receiver who ranks among the top 20 receivers of all time,
Schottenheimer insisted, is just another hurdle to clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wanted something low-risk,'' Schottenheimer said,
``then you should have gotten into coaching a tiddlywinks team.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Vikings quarterback Brad Johnson laughed when told
this week about Schotten-heimer's remarks. Johnson, probably
sidelined for a month with a broken bone, could be the poster boy
for an inexplicable rash of injuries that has coaches shuffling
lineups just two weeks into the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a seventh-year veteran, was injured last Sunday on a
noncontact play. The latest setback is especially frustrating,
because Johnson had rehabilitated from a 1997 neck injury which
threatened his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way things are going, if you actually tried (tiddlywinks),
you'd probably come up with a sprained thumb,'' Johnson said. ``For
there to be this many big injuries so early in the season ...is
really something, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   NFL officials are sensitive about the injury issue, perhaps
because the careful auditing of sprains and strains too often
magnifies the violent nature of the game. But statistics kept by
the NFL and several independent groups indicate that this season is
no more perilous than others.
</P>
<P>
   Through Wednesday morning, there were 88 players on injured
reserve and 18 more on either the physically unable-to-perform or
non-football-injury lists. Those numbers are slightly ahead of 1997
but comparable to the past five NFL seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Data compiled by the University of Iowa, where every NFL injury
is recorded and analyzed, indicated that the rate of injuries has
remained static the last decade. In the first two weeks of 1998,
players have missed an aggregate 210 games, about the same as last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Trainers and team physicians surveyed this week said there is
not enough evidence to label this season ``The Year of Living
Dangerously.'' If the workload is up, most medical staffs said, it
might be only on a few teams like the Chiefs, who have absorbed an
inordinate number of early injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of attention paid to injuries, and part of
the reason is that some high-profile players have gone down and
some teams have been affected at a very early point of the
season,'' said Tim Green, Fox analyst and former Atlanta defensive
end.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been some disturbing moments:
</P>
<P>
   Only 11 quarterbacks started every game for their teams last
year, an improvement from the previous season, but that number
could decrease in '98. A dozen quarterbacks have been knocked out
of games already, and by this weekend, at least six backups will
have started because of injuries. Only 17 quarterbacks have played
every one of their team's snaps.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' chances for contending in a diluted NFC East may hinge
on how quickly Troy Aikman, who has missed only four starts in 10
previous seasons, can recover from a broken left collarbone.
Critics blame defensive zone-blitz schemes, the regression of
offensive line play because of free-agency and four-wide receiver
sets that leave passers vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't know what more the league can do to protect
(quarterbacks),'' Aikman said. ``We have to protect ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   While injuries haven't increased dramatically, dramatic injuries
have. About two-dozen players already have sustained season-ending
knee injuries.
</P>
<P>
   At least four players are facing lengthy rehabilitations from
ruptured Achilles' tendons. Johnson and Green Bay tailback Dorsey
Levens both suffered broken legs last week. Giants linebacker Corey
Miller and Jacksonville center Michael Cheever might require
disk-fusion surgery. Atlanta tailback Byron Hanspard tore up his
knee in preseason while scoring on a touchdown run. Giants
cornerback Jason Sehorn tore an anterior cruciate ligament on his
first kickoff return since junior college. Vikings cornerback Jimmy
Hitchcock nearly lost the top portion of his right ring finger in
last week's game against the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like somebody put (Hitchcock's) hand through a
meat-grinder,'' Minnesota defensive coordinator Foge Fazio said.
</P>
<P>
   Some teams, including Kansas City and Carolina, have been
affected more than others, and that the Chiefs are regarded as a
Super Bowl contender focuses more attention on their plight.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs could be without defensive end Chester McGlockton
most of the season. Teammate John Browning will miss a few more
weeks. Pro Bowl-caliber guard Dave Szott probably will miss the
entire season. The Panthers have 16 injured, and 11 players have
not played in a game. Carolina's top three draft picks _ offensive
linemen Jason Peter (biceps), Chuck Wiley (Achilles') and Mitch
Marrow (back) _ have been injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a big, dark injury cloud has settled right over
us,'' Panthers linebacker Kevin Greene said.
</P>
<P>
   Off-field injuries and sicknesses have taken a toll. Denver lost
backup quarterback Jeff Lewis when he injured his knee in a pickup
basketball game. Giants running back LeShon Johnson is battling
non-Hodgkins lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``A knee injury probably would have been easier to accept,''
said Johnson's agent, Gary Wichard.
</P>
<P>
   Positions other than quarterback also have been gutted because
of injuries. The Journal-Constitution's ``All-Injury Team'' did not
lack for defensive linemen. Alfred Williams, Shawn King and Darren
Benson, to name a few, were left off the team. On offense, San
Francisco tackle Harris Barton could have filled in for Juan Roque.
Centers Michael Cheever and Frank Garcia were edged out by Steve
Everitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unusual to see the big-bodied guys beat up,'' Dallas
defensive line coach Jim Bates said, ``but the numbers of them is a
little unusual right now.''

POLITICS INTRUDES ON MULTICULTURAL DANCE FESTIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (smw) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYONS, France _ The Lyons Dance Biennial, arguably Europe's most
important dance festival, has started with a political bang and a
hot-tempered debate on multiculturalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mediterranea'' is the title of this year's event, and as usual
the 14-year-old biennial differs from other dance festivals by
offering a historical overview of dance in a single country or in
theme-related regions.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks of performances by traditional and experimental
troupes from Spain to Israel, by way of Italy and North Africa,
might conjure up visions of sun and surf, but actually the
festival's Mediterranean motif has made for some troubled waters.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, or precisely, not the National Front, France's
extreme-right political party, thinks that cultures rooted around
the shores of the Mediterranean are worth celebrating, especially
if their peoples (some dark-skinned) share a propensity for
emigrating to France.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a $70,000 subsidy for a three-hour parade organized by
the biennial on Sunday as a huge and vibrant tribute to
multiculturalism was voted down in July by the regional government
of Lyons. Charles Millon, the president of that body, the
Rhone-Alpes Regional Council, was elected with National Front
support and did not oppose the party's attack on the parade.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Vial, a National Front member of the council and first
vice president of its cultural commission, called the Mediterranean
theme ``pernicious'' and the parade an effort to condition people
mentally to ``glorify the theme of a multicultural and multiethnic
society'' that promotes ``a cultural mix.''
</P>
<P>
   Vial used ``metissage,'' which can connote miscegenation, as a
word for ``mix.'' His remarks, rebutted on national television by
Guy Darmet, the biennial's artistic director, warned of a
``cultural colonization'' of France that was taking place ``under
the name of immigration.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, and despite a brutally cold rain, the parade took
place as scheduled on Sunday. Actually a vast outreach project that
sent choreographers into 20 Arab and immigrant communities around
Lyons to train 3,000 participants, the event included Macedonian
and Israeli dances, hip-hop and African dances performed by
interracial groups.
</P>
<P>
   The parade ended on a triumphal note. As the marchers and
dancers, mostly young, reached Lyons' main square, the Place
Bellecour, the sun broke out over its equestrian statue of Louis
XIV and created a rainbow, a symbol of the message of tolerance
that Darmet has made the biennial's leitmotif.
</P>
<P>
   It was no accident that the national government sent its big
guns to the festival's gala opening last Thursday. Catherine
Trautmann, the minister of culture, went out of her way to attend a
rehearsal for the parade before going to the performance, an
eclectic range of song and dance, with Jean-Jack Queyranne, the
acting minister of the interior.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Barre, the mayor of Lyons and a former prime minister
whose parliamentary group has just excluded Millon, sat with the
ministers. Parliament members from the area also attended, as did
the Turkish ambassador and 10 other high-ranking diplomats whose
countries are represented in the festival.
 &UR;  &LR; It would be easy to say that any international festival is a
multicultural event. But context is everything. The paradox is that
the biennial became embroiled in racial and political tensions on
the domestic front while things went smoothly on the international
level.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese government, usually reluctant to participate in
events with Israeli groups, allowed the Ballets Caracalla, from
Beirut, to perform in a festival with four Israeli modern-dance
troupes. A government-sponsored company of whirling dervishes from
Egypt has also arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries taking part are France, Spain, Italy, Greece,
Morocco, Tunisia and Turkey. Algeria, where civil strife has shut
down professional dance activity, is represented by Algerians
living in France.
</P>
<P>
   The 28 dance troupes in the festival are supplemented by
individual artists, including singers like Houria Aichi, an
Algerian in exile who specializes in women's songs of the Aures
Mountains of Algeria. At the opening night gala, one did not need
to know that her lyrics referred to a woman's losing her child and,
by extension, her country. One was simply moved by her lament,
powerful in its sobbing refrain and ecstatic tone.
 &UR;  &LR; The program's other highlight was the joint appearance of three
splendid flamenco Gypsy dancers: Juana Amaya (fiery), La Tolea
(electric) and Manuela Carrasco (imposing). A group of male Gnawas
_ members of a Moroccan minority descended from black slaves _
offered a boisterous circular dance. An Adam-and-Eve duet by the
French choreographer Maguy Marin stood out on its own terms. One
could also manage to see a link between the flamenco dancers'
serpentine arms and those of Haifa Bouzouita, a Tunisian dancer.
</P>
<P>
   Although some folk forms are on display, the experimental dance
groups have, as usual, come to the fore. The most outstanding work
so far is ``Wasla,'' a premiere by Hela Fattoumi and Eric
Lamoureux, who performed at the American Dance Festival in Durham,
N.C., in 1995 and who should be seen in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Tunisia but brought up in France, Ms. Fattoumi begins
the piece with an extraordinary solo that looks abstract but speaks
of the plight of women in Arab society. Initially confined to a
womblike curved space, she plays with angular shifts of weight
before lifting her shirt as a veil to cover her face.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A women's trio and an athletic male quartet speak of homosexual
friendships in a male society that excludes women from equal
discourse. In all, ``Wasla'' is a brilliant work, able to
experiment on two levels, the expressive and the formal.
</P>
<P>
   The festival's big surprise has come from two innovative Greek
modern-dance troupes. Neither is shy about featuring nudity for
dramatic purpose. The Edafos Dance Theater's ``Medea'' suggests a
cinematic dream acted out by chalk-white dancer-mimes who move in
slow motion when not erupting into emotional outbursts. Dimitris
Papaioannou, the director and choreographer, is remarkably coherent
in his style and vision. He may not offer any illuminating insight
into a well-known tale, but he is never off-key in his retelling.
</P>
<P>
   As Jason and Medea on their wedding night, he and Angeliki
Stellatou thrash about on a table with extraordinary passion. After
Jason's infidelity, Medea kills her children by dashing two hand
puppets to smithereens.
</P>
<P>
   Their red innards fall into the ankle-deep pool below, the
``sea'' that Jason, portrayed as a priggish 19th-century admiral,
has crossed. The entire cast's intensity is striking, and the
Callas recordings of Bellini are unexpectedly apt.
</P>
<P>
   Konstantinos Rigos, the director of the Oktana Dance Theater,
the other Greek troupe, uses more conventional dance idioms in
``Five Seasons.'' But here too there are surprises, like the witty
homoerotic gloss on Nijinsky's ``Afternoon of a Faun.'' The
choreography for the three other regular seasons suggests a
balleticized version of Trisha Brown's style. The fifth season may
be set in a dubious future: to the sound of furious techno-rock, a
couple come in with symbols of the past. She carries a hammer, he
has a sickle.
</P>
<P>
   There are no such mysteries in ``Elyssa, the Queen of
Carthage,'' choreographed by Abdel-Halim Caracalla for his Ballets
Caracalla. Complexity yields to straightforward narrative in his
tale of Elyssa, otherwise known as Dido in the West. The dancers,
led by the charismatic Tania Haroun in the title role, are
energetic, moving with amazing speed in Caracalla's fusion of
ballet and modern dance. After Elyssa immolates herself onstage,
the dancers break into a Lebanese folk dance. Caracalla seeks,
above all, to entertain.

 THE REAGAN PAPERS 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although &UR; Ronald Reagan &LR;  didn't seem like our most scholarly
president, his administration produced an enormous volume of paper.
 &UR; Edmund Morris &LR; , whose authorized biography ``Dutch: A Memoir of
Ronald Reagan'' will be published this fall, shared some of the
numbers with Forbes FYI.
</P>
<P>
   Morris says the official papers of President Ronald Reagan
include 2,386 feet of things filed by given names, 200 feet of
sample popular mail, 2,449 feet of things filed by subject and 48
feet of things written in the president's hand. There are also 126
feet of material deemed confidential and 1,008 feet of Confidential
File Oversize Attachments. In all, the files include 50 million
pages of material.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TOO BUSY TO WRITE? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Congratulatory letters from the president of the United States,
the governor of California and the mayor of San Francisco are on
prominent display every year at the Grand National Rodeo Horse and
Stock Show, which opens at the Cow Palace on October 30.  &UR; Al
Guthertz &LR; , whose job it  &LR; is to request the letters, can't remember
ever being turned down.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, it seems the president is too busy. A letter
dated Sept. 8, 1998, to Grand National organizers from  &UR; Daniel &LR; 
 &UR; Burkhart &LR; , special assistant to the president, director of
correspondence and presidential messages, says that ``long-standing

DOTTIE PEPPER READY TO USE WORK ETHIC  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ohio _ Even as a child, Dottie Pepper was a
perfectionist. When Pepper was in kindergarten, her parents
received a note from the teacher that said Pepper took herself too
seriously. When Pepper started to play golf, she practiced so much
that unless her parents made her leave the driving range, Pepper
would often hit balls until her hands blistered.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents either had to threaten me, or make deals with me to
get me to leave,'' said Pepper, one of the most competitive players
in women's golf. ``But my parents and my grandparents all had a
work ethic. We believe that if you work hard, it comes back to
you.''
</P>
<P>
   For Pepper, the hard work has paid off. Also one of golf's most
consistent performers, Pepper is a key member of the United States
team that will face Europe in the fifth Solheim Cup, which begins
here Friday at Muirfield Village Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   The Solheim Cup is the women's version of the Ryder Cup, a
biennial match play competition between teams from America and
Europe. The atmosphere is unlike that of any other women's event,
with the 12 players on each side, as well as each captain, feeling
the pressure of playing both for their country and for their
teammates. The United States is the defending champion, but on
paper this year's team is Europe's strongest ever, led by Annika
Sorenstam, Liselotte Neumann and Laura Davies. Pepper expects a
close, intense battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on the losing side and the winning side,'' said
Pepper, who joins Betsy King as the only American players who have
qualified for all five Solheim Cup teams. ``When we lost in '92, it
seemed like it was a long two years until '94 finally came. But
when you win, like we did in '96, you get to enjoy it for two
years, which is a great feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying that Pepper looks forward to the Solheim Cup is like
saying children look forward to Christmas. Pepper has a career
record of 8-4-1 in the Solheim Cup, playing with a steely-eyed
intensity that can often rally her teammates. At the 1994 cup,
Pepper's enthusiasm rubbed some people the wrong way when she
pumped her fist after her opponent, Davies, missed a key putt. But
Pepper said she was cheering the fact that her team was still in
the match, not that Davies missed the putt. And those who know
Pepper best understand that her emotion is simply part of a more
complex package.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as somebody wearing their emotions on their sleeve, I
don't think you'll find anybody that does it more,'' said Kelly
Robbins, one of Pepper's Solheim Cup teammates. ``What a great
competitor. I'm glad she's on my team, that's for sure. She's one
of a kind. When Dottie's not happy, you know it. When she's happy,
you know that, too. But she doesn't mean anything by it. She's a
great person and she's got a big heart, very sensitive and very
caring. She adds character to our team. And if she didn't react
emotionally, we'd worry about her.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepper showed her sensitive side at a team gathering Tuesday
night, when the United States players presented their captain, Judy
Rankin, with a diamond-studded red-white-and-blue pin. When Pepper
made a short speech before presenting Rankin with the pin, Pepper
became teary-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's emotional because she is just a special individual,''
said Pepper of Rankin. ``I mean, she ironed my shirt this morning.
How many captains would do that?''
</P>
<P>
   At age 33, Pepper shows no sign of slowing down, although she
has not won an LPGA event since 1996. Pepper is ninth on this
year's money list ($457,109), with 10 top-10 finishes. A smart
player with years of match-play experience, Pepper has played well
in the past when teamed with both Brandie Burton and Betsy King,
giving Rankin plenty of options for this weekend's pairings.
</P>
<P>
   Pepper grew up in a sports environment. Her father, Don, was a
top minor league baseball prospect with the Detroit Tigers, and in
1968, he was featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated with other
top minor league prospects, including Johnny Bench. But when Don
Pepper's father died, he quit baseball and returned home to run the
family turkey farm in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., where Dottie grew up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dottie has always been the kind of person who is successful at
anything she puts her mind to,'' said Don, who will watch Dottie
from the gallery this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Away from golf, Pepper enjoys spending time with her husband,
Ralph Scarinzi, gardening, watching sports, playing with her pet
dog, named Furman, and music. Pepper took classical piano lessons
as a youngster, although she never seriously considered a career in
music.

   Although &UR; Ronald Reagan &LR;  didn't seem like our most scholarly
president, his administration produced an enormous volume of paper.
 &UR; Edmund Morris &LR; , whose authorized biography ``Dutch: A Memoir of
Ronald Reagan'' will be published this fall, shared some of the
numbers with Forbes FYI.
</P>
<P>
   Morris says the official papers of President Ronald Reagan
include 2,386 feet of things filed by given names, 200 feet of
sample popular mail, 2,449 feet of things filed by subject and 48
feet of things written in the president's hand. There are also 126
feet of material deemed confidential and 1,008 feet of Confidential
File Oversize Attachments. In all, the files include 50 million
pages of material.

Guthertz &LR; , whose job it  &LR; is to request the letters, can't remember

 FACING MORE COMPETITION, TOYS `R' US TO REORGANIZE 
</HEADLINE>
  (smw) 
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Toys ``R'' Us, the toy retailer that has been
struggling because of increased competition, said Wednesday that it
planned to revamp its business, close 90 stores, eliminate up to
3,000 jobs and take $495 million in after-tax charges.
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of its new chief executive, Robert Nakasone,
Toys ``R'' Us has been trying for more than a year to jump-start
sales and increase profitability as it faces stepped-up competition
from discount chains like Wal-Mart. The company is also searching
for ways to please harried parents who are tired of navigating its
mammoth, and often dated, stores.
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization is also intended to improve cash flow and
increase operating earnings by more than $75 million next year and
by a greater amount thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Investors reacted skeptically to the changes, however. The
company's shares closed at $18.125, down 75 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The company will close 50 international Toys ``R'' Us stores,
mainly in Europe, nine stores in the United States and 31 domestic
Kids ``R'' Us apparel stores. In addition, the retailer said it
would take $281 million in pretax charges to pare inventory, $29
million to close or consolidate stores and distribution centers and
to eliminate administrative functions and $102 million for
accounting changes. Toys ``R'' Us will take the charges in the
third quarter, which ends Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the store closings and charges, Toys ``R'' Us,
which is based in Paramus, N.J., said it would redesign its
remaining stores into a format that would enable the company to
increase its products. The new stores will include an expanded
electronics department to appeal to older children, a discount
section where parents can get bargain-priced birthday and holiday
toys and a clothing section for those looking for one-stop
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still don't know the most important thing we need to know:
How will these C-3 stores perform,'' said Ursula Moran, an analyst
who follows the company for Sanford C. Bernstein. C-3, which stands
for ``customer-driven, cost-effective and a concept for the
future,'' is the code name Toys ``R'' Us adopted for its new store
format.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moran said that the company had announced a new store
design, huge charges and inventory reductions when it ran into
trouble in the past, leaving her less impressed this time. ``The
company has got a credibility problem to some degree,'' she said,
adding that the latest inventory reduction seems ill timed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little worried about their lobbing out lots of markdown
inventory at the start of the holiday season, simply because that
could provoke a competitive response that might not be so pretty,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 of the company's domestic stores will be converted to
the new format next year with the remaining being upgraded within
two years. After the consolidation, Toys ``R'' Us will operate
1,403 stores and 183 Kids ``R'' Us stores and will eliminate its
two Kidsworld stores by folding them into existing toy stores.
</P>
<P>
   The initial phase of the company's revamping has already
produced $370 million in inventory reductions this year in U.S.
stores open more than a year, the company said. The new concept and
additional inventory reduction, which is necessary to enable stores
to accommodate new products, will improve merchandise planning and
distribution techniques and allow further improvements in inventory
turns in coming years, the company added.
</P>
<P>
   ``These actions will be the springboard to implementing our
expanded vision for the future, which is to provide not only toys
but also to provide our customers with broader merchandise
offerings and services for kids and families,'' Nakasone said.
Nakasone replaced Michael Goldstein seven months ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent quarter, ended Aug. 1, revenues inched up
just 1.6 percent, to $2.02 billion, while earnings before a charge
decreased 57 percent, to $15.9 million, or 6 cents a diluted share,
from $36.7 million, or 13 cents a diluted share, in the
corresponding period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst said the restructuring announced Wednesday had been
anticipated, so investors were not caught off guard by unexpected
bad news. As for the size of the charges, they ``cover a multitude
of sins,'' said David Leibowitz, an analyst who follows the company
for Burnham Securities. &QL;

CLINTON'S PUSH TO CALM FINANCIAL TURMOIL MEETS OBSTACLES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)  (Eds.: 2nd take is scheduled to move by 9:30 p.m. ET) 
(mk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's push to quell the global
financial turmoil ran into several obstacles Wednesday, as Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, testified that the world's
big economies had no plans for a coordinated interest-rate
reduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can safely say at the moment there is no endeavor to
coordinate interest-rate cuts,'' Greenspan told the House Banking
Committee, but he again hinted that the global crisis could lead
the Federal Reserve to cut domestic rates. ``Deflationary forces
are continuing t emerge'' in much of the rest of the world, he
said, and they are moving toward the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In another setback to coordinated action, negotiations between
Brazil, the International Monetary Fund and the major industrial
nations over a multibillion dollar rescue package hit political
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian officials appear hesitant to seek aid in advance of
their country's presidential election in two weeks, especially
because a condition for the help would be an agreement to make
unpopular budget cuts, people involved in the negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the political obstacles to coming up with a
rescue package for Brazil _ which Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
indicated Wednesday was the focus in Latin America of American
concern _ and the obvious discord within the Group of Seven
industrial nations over whether a global interest-rate cut is
needed suggests that Clinton's agenda will be extremely difficult
to enact.
</P>
<P>
   American investors had been hopeful that Clinton's call on
Monday for a concerted push to contain the fast-spreading global
crisis would lead to quick action to shore up the embattled
economies of Latin America. Clinton's words, they hoped, would spur
central banks to put aside their traditional fixation on inflation
and cut rates to promote growth.
</P>
<P>
   But Germany's powerful central bank, the Bundesbank, signaled
Tuesday that it continued to see inflation as a threat in Europe,
and officials from other nations have also been playing down the
possibility of quick action on rates or any other response to the
world's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, however, Greenspan said there was evidence
that the robust pace of growth was slowing and that investors were
becoming more nervous about how the global crisis was affecting the
domestic financial system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that despite the still very solid American economy
as of now, there are really the first signs of erosion at the
edges, especially in manufacturing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve will next meet to consider interest-rate
policy on Sept. 29, and despite Greenspan's hints that a rate cut
could be considered, it is by no means clear that the Fed's other
members are ready to act.
</P>
<P>
   William Poole, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St.
Louis, said Wednesday that although the Fed was under pressure to
help other economies and the world financial system, it had to stay
focused on restraining inflation in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   While he did not rule out supporting a rate cut, Poole, one of
the Fed's most ardent inflation fighters, said that an ``attempt to
pursue other objectives that in fact damaged pursuit of price
stability in the United States would only add to world financial
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments this week marked the first time that he had
spelled out a plan of action, and Wednesday, at a news conference,
he told reporters that fighting the financial crisis was ``the most
important subject now facing the world community.'' He argued that
``my objectives were embraced by the leaders, the financial
leaders, of the largest industrial countries in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some of his closest aides conceded in private that his call
for action came late, and that the problems of economic contagion
are now far more complicated than they were in early August, when
he first considered giving the speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should have done this months ago,'' one of his closest
advisers said Wednesday, acknowledging that the plan would be even
more difficult to achieve when the president is fending off calls
for resignation, impeachment or censure.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   American officials are clearly worried about the fallout if
Brazil, one of America's largest trading partners, is hit full
force by the economic contagion caused by the flight of investors
from emerging markets worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, testifying Wednesday, was cautious discussing Brazil,
saying that it ``is obviously enormously important to this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been very focused on this, actually,'' he said, ``for
quite some time, and particularly over the course of the past week.
I think it is probably premature to comment on specifics other than
to assure you that this has been the subject of intense focus
through last week, the weekend, and up to the current moment.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Brazilian caution before a presidential election,
the nation's problems are fed by the fear of a renewed attack on
the currency as investors continue to flee emerging markets and
worries that the IMF's emergency reserves must be carefully
conserved.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian officials say they have not asked the IMF for direct
help. But on Tuesday night, the finance minister, Pedro Malan, said
that his government was talking to the IMF and the Group of Seven
countries about ways to bolster the confidence of investors. He
hinted that the IMF would put together a line of credit, probably
more than $25 billion, that Brazil and its neighbors could draw on
to defend their currencies and pay their international debts.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday morning, hours after President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso talked to Clinton by telephone in a discussion that neither
government described in detail, Malan backed away. ``It is not for
Brazil to speak for the IMF or any G-7 country or make comments on
the terms, volumes and conditions upon which international
cooperation could or would be made available to countries if the
need arises,'' he said. Other officials said that there had not
been any discussion of the size of the package.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was out ahead of himself,'' one person close to the
negotiations said, insisting on anonymity, ``but he wasn't entirely
blowing smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Malan, much like officials in Thailand and Korea late last year,
may have been dangling the possibility of international help to
encourage the recent run-up in the Brazilian stock market _ which
could help stave off the need for help. He did not discuss the
conditions that Brazil would have to meet in return for the
commitment of backup financing because they are likely to create
trouble for Cardoso as his re-election campaign enters its final
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF, officials say, would insist that Brazil cut its huge
budget deficit, which currently runs about 7 percent of the
country's gross domestic product. That would mean pushing cuts in
social programs or military spending through a notoriously
undisciplined Congress, a task that the government would prefer to
tackle after the elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very, very slow mating dance,'' said an official
involved in the discussions. ``The Brazilians don't want to
acknowledge that they need help, but they also don't want to risk a
meltdown of their economy in the next few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Putting together a rescue package would almost certainly involve
committing to use the last $15 billion left in the IMF's
``emergency fuel tank,'' a fund called the general agreement to
borrow. It is essentially a loan from the world's major economies,
which used the same fund in July in a failed effort to prop up
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has used only $4.8 billion of the money it was promised,
but billions more are committed to Moscow should it meet the IMF's
conditions of collecting more taxes and keeping the money supply
under control. So far, the new Russian government, appointed just
days ago, appears to be moving in the opposite direction.

AFTER 1,011 GAMES, ARMY JOINS A CONFERENCE

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST POINT, N.Y. _ It has played football for 108 years, 1,011
games in all against teams from across the nation. It maintains a
narrow edge over Navy in one of the oldest and most resonant
rivalries in college sports. But the history of Army football takes
a modern turn Saturday when a pair of teams without a victory
square off at Michie Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   When Army (0-1) faces Cincinnati (0-2) here, the Black Knights
will turn the page on more than a century as an independent to
compete in their first game as the newest member of Conference USA.
</P>
<P>
   It is the beginning of an era when FOX SportsNet, new rivals
such as Southern Mississippi and post-season games like the Liberty
Bowl will become part of Army lore along with Glenn Davis and the
Commander-in-Chief's Trophy. In the view of Army athletic
officials, it is vital to remaining in the mainstream of big-time
college football.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows our commitment to playing Division I-A football,''
said Al Vanderbush, Army's athletic director. ``We were playing a
couple of Division I-AA schools and getting criticized for it.
Other schools were using it to recruit against us. This makes us
more competitive, gives us an identity, and I believe kids today
would like to look up and see there is a conference championship to
play for and an all-conference team to make.''
</P>
<P>
   More important, beyond just survival, it shifts Army's focus to
getting a greater share of the millions of television dollars
flowing into college football. Besides a competitive schedule and
the promise of bowl games, Army now gets a marketing outfit _ the
conference _ dedicated to making it network- and cable-ready.
</P>
<P>
   Army is not alone in trying to reposition itself in an
increasingly competitive race for television dollars and bowl
payouts. Last May, the presidents of eight Western universities,
including Air Force, stunned the college athletic community when
they announced they were leaving the Western Athletic Conference to
form their own league.
</P>
<P>
   They cited everything from unmanageable travel _ the conference
stretched from Hawaii to Houston _ to the dilution of geographical
rivalries. But the fact that television and bowl money did not
stretch far when divided by 16 teams was perhaps the clincher.
</P>
<P>
   Even Notre Dame, the only major power among the eight remaining
Division I-A independents, which has its own five-year, $45 million
television contract with NBC, is talking to Big Ten officials about
joining the conference to insure economic health and stability.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in professional sports, the driving factor in this
climate of change is television money. The Big Ten commissioner,
James E. Delany, estimates the annual market for college football
television rights at $300 million and growing.
</P>
<P>
   In the new Bowl Championship Series which ABC will televise, the
title game will be worth from $11 million to $12 million a team.
Jon D. Litner, senior vice president for programming at ABC Sports,
says that like the makers of soft drinks, schools are ``fighting
for shelf space'' and are turning to high-quality marketing and
aggressive representation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an enormous amount of revenue that television
generates,'' Litner said. ``I'm sure schools are making decisions
on who they affiliate with because of television.'' ABC, along with
ESPN under the Disney umbrella, is the biggest player in college
football and will broadcast 21 of 26 post-season games.
</P>
<P>
   Conference USA, in its third year of existence, offered Army
access it did not previously have to a television contract and two
bowl games. It also offered a schedule of mid-major Southern
universities with which Academy officials believed a school of
4,000 cadets _ none on true athletic scholarships _ could compete.
The conference is composed of Cincinnati, Tulane, Memphis,
Louisville, Houston, Southern Miss and East Carolina, and its
champion earns an automatic berth in the Liberty Bowl, which last
year had a $1.1 million payout per team.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Humanitarian Bowl in Boise, Idaho, will hold a
place for another Conference USA team, worth an additional $750,000
to each team. And the conference's deal with Fox SportsNet pays
dividends in exposure _ five Army games are scheduled to be
televised this season and the number could reach nine. Last year,
three Army games were televised, including the Navy game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The television and bowl opportunities are attached exclusively
to the conferences anymore,'' said Army Coach Bob Sutton. ``The
independents out there don't really have a voice. We have a broad
recruiting base in the South that we're going to reach more
effectively. Every game is going to mean something in the
conference standings. Kids are going to see us more and we'll be
validated as a program.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The athletic budget at Army is $15 million, of which $3 million
comes from the government, primarily to cover salaries. Revenue
from football carries the academy's 25 other athletic teams.
Vanderbush said attendance and concessions at Army's home games,
television contracts and donations connected to the football
program account for the vast majority of the remaining $12 million.
Army will continue to play Air Force and Navy for the
Commander-in-Chief's trophy and, in an essential piece of deal
making, did not give up its television rights for the annual
classic against the Midshipmen.
</P>
<P>
   The Army-Navy game, recently renewed by CBS through 2008, is
among the most lucrative in college sports. The previous contract
was worth $1 million a year for both Army and Navy, which remains
an independent, and Vanderbush said that had increased
significantly, although he would not give a figure.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbush, the Army athletic director, said that the Conference
USA affiliation is initially worth an additional $300,000 to
$400,000 a year to Army, though the windfall is largely offset this
year because the Black Knights lost a home game in the switch to
the conference schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Conference USA is part of the Bowl Championship Series, but is
only guaranteed a place in one of the four big-money games _
Fiesta, Rose, Sugar or Orange _ if one of its teams finishes No. 6
or higher in the series' ranking. Still, the conference receives
$800,000 for being a part of the series, according to Mike Slive,
the conference's commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Slive said flatly that Army would make more money in Conference
USA than it would have as an independent. In turn, he said, the
other schools in the conference have acquired a valuable commodity
to bolster their status in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get its storied tradition and great football history, which
helps our name recognition,'' Slive said. ``Contracts and
governance are conference-driven. The revenues are market-driven.
Our goal is to be at the table and be ready to move up and take our
share.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy Kramer, the longtime commissioner of the powerful
Southeastern Conference, anticipates more conference realignment.
Fortunately for Army, it has already made its move. ``My athletic
directors can divide,'' Kramer said. ``And unless you have
something valuable to bring, conferences may get smaller before
they get bigger.'' &QL;

GOTTI'S SON TO BE RELEASED ON BAIL AHEAD OF TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ Nine months after he was arrested on
racketeering charges, John A. Gotti, the son of the imprisoned mob
boss, was ordered released on bail Wednesday by a federal judge who
said adequate steps could be taken to insure that he was no threat
to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The order, by U.S. District Court Judge Barrington Parker, ends
months of legal skirmishing in which the U.S. attorney's office
contended that Gotti was running the Gambino crime family for his
father, John J. Gotti, and should not be allowed to move around
unfettered before his trial, scheduled to begin in January.
</P>
<P>
   Before he is released, Gotti will learn the precise conditions
of bail from a second federal judge, Mark Fox, on Thursday. His
lawyers have offered $10 million in collateral as well as
volunteering several restrictions on his movement: confinement to
his $700,000 home in Oyster Bay, the wearing of an ankle bracelet
that would alert officials to any violation, and the posting of a
security guard outside his home.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Gotti were elated that their client would now be
able to appear before the jury hearing his case as a free man
rather than a prisoner. That difference, said Gotti's colorful
lawyer, Bruce Cutler, has a subtle impact on juries.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your fighting for your life, what's most important is to
come through the front door rather than the back door,'' Cutler
said.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the U.S. attorney's office did not respond to
three telephone messages seeking a comment on Parker's order.
</P>
<P>
   But in arguing against bail, Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney
for the Southern District of New York, contended in August that
Gotti was an ongoing threat to the community because he was at
``the pinnacle of power in an enduring, brutal criminal
enterprise.'' To buttress that charge, her office produced a
fingerprint of Gotti's taken from a promotion list of the Gambino
family. Such lists, argued Ms. White, are seen by only the
highest-ranking members of each of the five New York crime
families.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti, 34, is charged with an array of crimes, including a
scheme to take virtual control of Scores, a topless nightclub on
Manhattan's Upper East Side, and the extortion of money from a
construction company that sought protection against minority
demonstrators. If convicted, he would face a 20-year jail sentence.
Ten other defendants are scheduled to go on trial with him.
</P>
<P>
   Sarita Kedia, another lawyer representing Gotti, said Gotti had
called her when he learned from his wife, Kim, that he would soon
be released. ``He is overjoyed that he can be with his wife and
four children,'' Ms. Kedia said.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking bail, Gerald Shargel, another defense lawyer, argued
that the government had produced no evidence that Gotti was a Mafia
boss, despite recording hundreds of hours of conversations between
Gotti and his 58-year-old father, who is serving a life sentence in
a federal penitentiary.
</P>
<P>
   Shargel and his associate, Ms. Kedia, said then that Gotti was
willing to post $10 million in collateral, including the $4 million
home of his sister, Victoria, in Old Westbury, to insure that he
would not flee.
</P>
<P>
   Parker said Gotti's lawyers had offered a combination of
``conditions and security'' that the lawyers believe ``afford the
community protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kedia said her office and Cutler would file a set of motions
next week attacking the government's case against Gotti.

MARKET PLACE: DELAY IN GLOBAL RATE CUT NO SURPRISE TO MANY 
</HEADLINE>
  (smw) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ American investors shrugged off Wednesday's
suggestion that no global interest rate cut was immediately in
store to help the world's weak economies.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, appeared to
shut the door on such a move when he told the House Banking
Committee that ``at the moment there is no endeavor to coordinate
interest rate cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Dow Jones industrial average finished the day 65
points higher. Just over a week ago, the stock market had soared on
Greenspan's suggestion that global financial problems posed as
great a threat to the United States as inflation did, suggesting
that a rate cut to stimulate the economy might be on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, though, that the already struggling emerging
markets will falter on the suggestion that help is not immediately
on the way. Brazil's stock market, which rallied 45 percent in
three days on hopes of a global rate cut and the promise of
international aid, eased after Greenspan's remarks, ending the day
down 2.11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Investors also pushed U.S. Treasury prices up and yields lower,
signaling a continued flight to safety and concern about the
outlook for equity markets.
</P>
<P>
   But based on one gauge of sentiment, the delay of a global rate
cut was no surprise to many investors. That gauge is the futures
contracts on the federal funds rate. The contract ``naturally
embodies the market's expectation of what the Fed will do,''
according to a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The
federal funds rate, or the rate banks charge each other on
overnight loans, is the central bank's target for short-term
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   All week, the price on the federal funds futures contract fell.
That indicated a rise in the yield, which moves in the opposite
direction from the price. As of Friday, the yield for the October
contract was 5.25 percent. Because that yield represents the
expected average for the month and because the next rate-setting
meeting of the Federal Reserve is on Sept. 29, it presaged a cut of
one-quarter of a percentage point in the federal funds target from
the current 5.5 percent level, according to Dana Saporta, an
economist with Stone &AMP; McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of trading Wednesday on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the yield had risen to 5.34 percent, meaning that investors
see a smaller probability of a rate cut at the September meeting.
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean that they do not expect a rate cut at all.
They do, and that is reflected in the futures contracts for later
months. The yield on the December contract is down to 5.21 percent,
and was as low as 5.14 percent last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The indicator now seems to suggest that a rate cut must await
two events: the meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank early next month and a worsening of the current crisis.
If financial markets stabilize, there might be no rate cut in the
near future _ which would presumably push the yields on these
futures contracts even higher.
</P>
<P>
   Investors now have to reconsider what is meant by ``global
coordination'' _ which are likely to be buzzwords for some time.
Just because President Clinton and other leaders in the Group of
Seven industrial nations recently talked of how to respond to the
global financial crisis, they are not yet springing into action.
Rather, world political and financial leaders are merely reassuring
investors that they are keeping a close eye on the crisis.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The lack of an automatic safety net was one of the harsh lessons
from the Russian economy's recent deep troubles, but that may not
have fully sunk in yet.
</P>
<P>
   The shift in sentiment about the prospects of a rate cut can be
attributed to several factors. Investors tend to overreact to any
news, whether positive or negative. That was the case with
Greenspan's speech at Berkeley, Calif., on Sept. 4. He did not
promise a rate cut then; he just suggested that the central bank
would consider one if the foreign drag on the U.S. economy
worsened.
</P>
<P>
   Some other officials have also thrown cold water on the idea of
a coordinated global cut in interest rates. The president of the
German central bank, Hans Tietmeyer, said on Tuesday that there was
no immediate rate cut under consideration, adding that lower rates
now would be the wrong medicine for Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Brown, the British chancellor of the exchequer, said any
coordinated moves by the Group of Seven _ which besides the United
States includes Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada _
would not come before the twice-a-year meeting of the IMF and the
World Bank. He did not rule out a rate cut, though, when he said
that the Group of Seven is ``fully focused on the need to maintain
demand growth in the current environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, a rate cut by the Federal Reserve is still likely to be
weighed domestically, rather than globally, with the key being the
strength of the American economy.
</P>
<P>
   William Poole, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St.
Louis, said Wednesday, ``If the financial turmoil in the world
threatens to depress the U.S. economy, then adjustment of U.S.
monetary policy is appropriate, and the Fed will make that
adjustment when the case for it is clear.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is worth remembering that the federal futures contracts
merely reflect investor sentiment. They are not great predictors of
Fed action. According to the St. Louis Fed report, the federal fund
futures have forecast only about one-third of the changes in rate
policy from August 1988 through 1997.

FLORIDA STATE FEELING SHAKY AFTER UPSET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's a tough time to be in Tallahassee, and we're
not referring to the humidity.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State is a little woozy this week, trying to shake off
the effects of its shocking 24-7 loss to unranked North Carolina
State.
</P>
<P>
   How bad a loss was it? Consider the fallout:
</P>
<P>
   _For the first time since 1990, the Seminoles are not ranked
among the top 10 teams in the country.
</P>
<P>
   _For the first time since 1991, the scourge of the Atlantic
Coast Conference is coming off a game in which it did not score in
double-digits.
</P>
<P>
   _For the first time since 1989, the Seminoles lost in September
and dropped to 11th in both polls.
</P>
<P>
   _For just the second time in seven years, the Seminoles lost an
ACC game.
</P>
<P>
   The elite aura surrounding Florida State's program has been
damaged, and all because of one little loss. But that's the price
you pay when you get snuffed out by a downtrodden program.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina State had not defeated a top-10 team this decade
and an opening-game performance against Ohio University gave no
indication that the Wolfpack would have any chance against the
mighty Seminoles.
</P>
<P>
   Now the question is, where do the Seminoles go from here?
</P>
<P>
   First, they have to figure out their quarterback situation.
Chris Weinke had a horrible day, completing just 9 of 32 passes and
throwing a school-record six interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   But the 26-year-old sophomore is in a tough spot. After a
six-year stint in the Toronto Blue Jays organization, Weinke came
back to college football last year. He was to get another year of
seasoning until projected starter Dan Kendra was lost with a knee
injury during spring practice.
</P>
<P>
   So Weinke became the starter and started his first game against
Texas A&AMP;M in the Kickoff Classic _ his first start of any football
game in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   And the Seminoles coaching staff simply put too much of a burden
on its inexperienced quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we overloaded our quarterback with our total
offensive package and he's not ready for that total package,''
Florida State coach Bobby Bowden said. ``Just like our previous
first-year starting quarterbacks were not. We loaded him down like
he's a senior and he's not. He's a sophomore and it showed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we got behind, we went to four receivers and five
receivers out there and he wasn't sure what to do with it, and he
lost his ability to concentrate and throw the ball. We'll have to
get back and cut his decisions down in half because he's not ready
for all that stuff yet.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a predicament that doesn't figure to get completely
straightened out by the time USC goes to Tallahassee next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Watch out, Carson Palmer: North Carolina State coach Mike O'Cain
has refuted reports that he accused Florida State's defense of
dirty play. The Seminoles knocked nine quarterbacks out of games
last season and tend to ``play on the edge,'' O'Cain said. ``They
play as close to the edge as you can play. Sometimes it's past the
edge.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA fan: The Bruins received one first-place vote in the
Associated Press poll, thanks to Scooter Hobbs of the Lake Charles,
La., American Press.
</P>
<P>
   He had a (wet) ball: It seems Fresno State had a secret weapon
the night it upset USC 24-7 in the 1992 Freedom Bowl, a win that
cost then-coach Larry Smith his job.
</P>
<P>
   That weapon was Mike Moschetti, who started at quarterback in
Colorado's 29-21 victory over Fresno State last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Moschetti, who recently played three years as a shortstop in the
Oakland A's minor-league system, was a 17-year-old senior at La
Mirada High School when the Bulldogs met the Trojans that rainy
evening at Anaheim Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``My high school baseball coach (at La Mirada) was an official
in the Freedom Bowl, so he asked me to be the ball boy. Understand,
I grew up hating SC and everything about it _ band, campus and the
fans, cocky and rich,'' Moschetti said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyway, it's pouring down rain and I've got a Fresno State hat
on. I kept Fresno State's ball under my shirt to keep it dry. SC's?
I left it out in the open. I didn't give a darn that Rob Johnson
(the Trojans' quarterback) was screaming at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprising stat: Since the breakup of the Southwest Conference
after the 1995 season, Rice and Texas Tech have the best records in
terms of winning percentage of the former league's eight teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Owls and Red Raiders are 15-9 (.625), while Texas A&AMP;M is
16-11 (.593) and Texas 13-12 (.520). Baylor, Houston, SMU and TCU
all have losing records.
</P>
<P>
   No sticks: There's a strange sign at the entrance to
Mississippi's Vaught-Hemingway Stadium: ``No sticks.''
</P>
<P>
   Sticks hold flags. Confederate flags. No sticks, no flags.
</P>
<P>
   Fasani's future: Two years ago, Stanford signed Randy Fasani,
considered by many the top-rated prep quarterback in the nation.
But today, Fasani is fighting just to be the Cardinal's
second-string quarterback and is losing out to Camarillo's Joe
Borchard.
</P>
<P>
   There are rumors Stanford might explore Fasani's willingness to
switch positions, perhaps to tight end. In Saturday's loss to
Arizona, Fasani entered the game for one play at that spot.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal coach Ty Willingham said it was a one-time deal, but
with starter Todd Husak looking at two more years of eligibility
after this season, Stanford might try to find a new spot for
Fasani.

(th) 
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It might not have been apparent to most Americans,
but from the Czech perspective it was clear that by appearing at
President Clinton's side at a news conference Wednesday, President
Vaclav Havel was not only repaying a friend for bringing his
country into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, but was
standing in solidarity with a fellow philanderer contending with a
culture much more judgmental than his own.
</P>
<P>
   Asked several times about Clinton's difficulties involving sex,
Havel, who came to Washington a month after intestinal surgery,
looked up at the president with whom he had once played a saxophone
duet in Prague, called him a great friend and praised him for his
international leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed for more of a response, he said he would like ``to offer
congratulations to Mr. McGwire and to wish success to Mr. Sammy
Sosa.'' As for the rest of it, he said, ``I don't like to speak
about things which I don't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not that Czechs ignore sex or the concupiscent adventures
of their leaders or fellow citizens. Indeed no country has a
serious literature in which sex and politics intertwine so
profoundly.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best known example of this is Milan Kundera's novel,
``The Unbearable Lightness of Being,'' where the hero's conflicted
yearnings for the down-to-earth Tereza and the tantalizingly
ethereal Sabina serve as metaphors for broader themes of freedom
and responsibility. Similar uses of private affairs to reflect
public issues appear in the works of Ivan Klima and Josef
Skvorecky, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every contemporary Czech movie has some, usually comic,
adulterous scene. Not long after Havel married Dagmar Veskrnova in
1997, the new first lady, an actress, appeared fully and frontally
nude in a movie playing a character who at one point says she will
never have anything more to do with politicians.
</P>
<P>
   There was more public comment about the line than about the
nudity and in any case there was no condemnation of it. Billboards
in Prague and other cities show copulating couples in advertising
for products like office machines that would probably stir outrage
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   No, the Czechs, a nominally Catholic people, are at least as
openly fascinated by sex as Americans. They just do not seem to be
ready to blame or castigate those among them who stumble or fall
from grace, whether fictional characters or real politicians.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when on Monday, Miroslav Macek, the deputy leader
of the Civic Democratic Party, one of the major parties, was asked
why no sexual scandal had erupted in the Czech Republic, he
answered, ``Czechs have not been that terribly estranged from
nature as Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The married politician, a national figure who has never
concealed and sometimes flaunted his relationships with women,
declared, ``That men from time to time have women is fortunately
considered natural here.''
</P>
<P>
   One explanation for this high degree of tolerance and a rigid
respect of privacy is that under totalitarian Communism, private
lives, no matter how complex and intertwined, were regarded as
hallowed refuges. Jirina Siklova, probably the country's best known
feminist and the founder of the gender studies center at Charles
University addressed this theme in an article published in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under socialism,'' Ms. Siklova, wrote, ``because people could
not fulfill themselves in their often meaningless work for the
state, personal relationships were even more significant for them
than in Western countries. This is testified to by the high
marriage and divorce rates, the widespread sexual promiscuity and
the tolerance of extramarital sex, infidelity, and abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Havel's experience in these areas offers a contrast
with that of his saxophone partner. In the years that he was the
often imprisoned leading dissident in what was then Czechoslovakia,
Havel's closest friend and confidant was his wife, Olga, whom he
had known since 1956 and married in 1964. It was she who had
advised him that when he was being interrogated he should never
tell the police anything, ``not even the name of your dog.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also to her that he wrote from prison refining his ideas
on living in truth and talking truth to power. The correspondence
subsequently was published as the book, ``Letters to Olga.''
</P>
<P>
   Until her death of cancer in December 1996, they remained the
very best of friends. Yet as the American writer Paul Berman wrote
in the The New York Times Magazine, ``Vaclav and Olga had not been
exactly faithful to each other in the romantic sense, but they had
been loyal and close in other respects.''
</P>
<P>
   Such views of the marriage had circulated before the Communist
collapse within the tiny dissident community, where a record of
sexual fidelity had less to do with determining a persons standing
than loyalty to each other and a reputation for never cooperating
with the secret police.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Olga's death, Havel's relationship with Ms. Veskrnova
became apparent and its earlier existence was widely retroactively
assumed. She was referred to in the press as his lover but, though
Havel has his enemies, the issue of their relationship was never
raised in a political context, since politicians realized that this
was not a fertile area.
</P>
<P>
   But given the great respect that Olga had commanded, Ms.
Veskrnova was not readily accepted by large sectors of the public.
She was the butt of many jokes and the press, which withheld
comment on the propriety of having a first lady appear nude in a
film, did direct criticism at matters of decorum and housekeeping,
both of which the Czechs take seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Among these were her differences with Havel's brother, her
behavior when she whistled in Parliament, and most particularly on
her expulsion of Olga's dog from the castle. &QL;

 &HT;    Smoltz's `Cy' of relief
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   His showpiece will forever be the 24-8, NL Cy Young campaign of
1996. Then, he was unquestionably the best pitcher in baseball.
Now, John Smoltz has fashioned what may prove an even more
satisfying season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm as proud of this year as any year I've had,'' Smoltz said
Wednesday after another sun-kissed afternoon in a season full of
wonder. He won his 16th game in just his 25th start, throwing six
shutout innings to beat the Phillies 5-1 at the Ted. Now 16-3,
Smoltz is 11-1 since the All-Star break and says, half-kidding,
``If there was such a thing as a second-half Cy Young Award, I'd
probably win it.''
</P>
<P>
   His ERA is down to 2.99. His winning percentage, already the
best in the big leagues, is now .843. Since the start of the 1996
season, Smoltz is 55-23, tying the Yankees' Andy Pettitte for the
most wins during that stretch. And it's no stretch to suggest
Smoltz will get consideration for a second Cy Young, even if he
won't start again until October.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was Smoltz's last regular-season start, the better to
rest his elbow and gear up for his moment: the postseason.
``Obviously, I'd love to (start Game 1 of the postseason),'' said
Smoltz. ``That's what I'm about.'' Instead, Atlanta's Mr. October
will skip his last two September starts, heal himself and prepare
for the NL Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not great and I don't complain about it,'' Smoltz said of
his right elbow, which required arthroscopic surgery last December,
and caused him to begin this season on the disabled list and return
to the DL May 24-June 20. Instead, Smoltz will rest his elbow for
several days, then confer with manager Bobby Cox and pitching coach
Leo Mazzone about their postseason rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``And attack it from there,'' said Smoltz. ``I don't want to go
the whole time (until the playoffs) without throwing.'' He
anticipates working an inning or two next week. ``I'm going to go
by my elbow and see how it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   In spring training, it seemed Smoltz would never be in this
position. Eddie Perez caught Smoltz's first spring outing, when the
pitcher was understandably tentative. Afterward, Perez and Javy
Lopez, who normally catches Smoltz, were in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I don't think we're going to be able to count on
Smoltzie this year,''' said Perez, who caught Smoltz Wednesday for
the first time this season and went 3-for-3 and homered.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz, too, has been stunned by his success. ``Anything I
planned for didn't happen,'' he said. ``I planned for a 3-7
(season), 5-10. It's been a ton of joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody understands the last three, four years
(and the recurrent elbow problems). There's a ton of relief. God
has played a part in it. It's been an incredible year.''
</P>
<P>
   And it could yet improve with a second World Series title and,
perhaps, a second Cy Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been able to sneak by and have this year because of all
our great starters,'' said Smoltz. ``There's no criteria for the
(Cy Young) award. You can't take away from Tom Glavine, Greg Maddux
and Kevin Brown. If I'm considered and got some votes, that'd be
great.''

 &HT;    Neagle eager to pitch, pain-free after layoff
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Hyperactive even when he has regular work, Denny
Neagle finally returns to the mound tonight after a 10-day absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't stay bottled up for long,'' said Neagle, who starts
the opener of a four-game series at Arizona after missing his last
two starts due to bursitis in his pitching shoulder. ``These 10
days have been so long. I knew they would be, especially now that
the team has been playing well (a 5-1 homestand and winning six of
seven). You always want to contribute and I've been a cheerleader.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a big weight off my shoulder knowing there's no pain
and knowing I can contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   After soreness and tightness in the side of his left shoulder
for a couple of weeks, Neagle skipped his scheduled Sept. 7 start
in New York, flew home for an examination by team orthopedist Joe
Chandler and got a cortisone injection. That caused him to miss
another start, last Saturday. Now, Neagle reports no pain in his
shoulder, even after a side session in the bullpen Monday. All
systems are go.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's felt great, the best it's felt in three, four weeks,''
said Neagle, who said he could've started last Saturday. ``But why
rush it? Why not be overly cautious right now? I'd rather beat the
Astros or the Padres in the postseason than beat whoever now.''
</P>
<P>
   A win tonight would make Neagle 14-11 and give Atlanta five
15-game winners. The last big-league club to do that: The 1930
Washington Senators. The last NL team? The '25 Pirates. Neagle
wants to join that 15-win fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you have a chance to do something that hasn't been
done since 1930, of course it means a lot,'' he said. ``I want to
get it really bad. We can look back at it years from now and say,
`We did that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie! Eddie!
</P>
<P>
   Catching John Smoltz for the first time all season, Eddie Perez
had an even better day at the plate than behind it. He went 3-for-3
with his fifth homer, a two-run shot. ``Every time he catches, he
does a good job with the bat, too,'' Bobby Cox said of Perez, whose
average is now .338.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked hard in the offseason and said to myself, `I've got
to have a good year,' '' said Perez, a lifetime .236 hitter who
usually catches Greg Maddux and entered this season with just 11
homers in 360 career at-bats (his fifth came in his 135th
Wednesday). ``I was thinking too much last year and the year
before. This year, when I get my chances, get my pitches, I want to
be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical front
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Seanez, who hasn't pitched since suffering a slight muscle
tear in his right forearm Sept. 5, threw off a mound for the first
time Wednesday and had no problems. ``It went well,'' said Seanez,
who pitched for nearly 15 minutes. ``I threw hard without throwing
anything over the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   If the forearm feels good today, Seanez said, ``I could go
Friday. If they want to play it safe and wait, fine. I'm
comfortable with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Danny Bautista, meanwhile, was fitted Wednesday for a
lighter, less cumbersome knee brace for his right knee. He's been
on the DL since Aug. 25 with a slight tear of his right medial
collateral ligament. Bautista plans to practice tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Chen was named the minor league pitcher of the year by
Howe Sportsdata International, the offical stat service of the
minor leagues. Chen was 13-7 with a 3.29 ERA at Greenville, with
164 strikeouts in 132 innings, then 2-1, 1.88 at Class AAA Richmond
before a September call-up to Atlanta, where he's 1-0, 5.79 in two
starts. ... The Saturday, Sept. 26 home game against the Mets,
originally scheduled for 7:10 p.m., has been switched to a 1:15
start as a Fox nationally televised game.

 &HT;    ACC NOTES
 &HT;    By Norman Arey and Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEMSON at Virginia, Saturday, 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   After suffering its worst home loss in 22 years, a 37-0 drubbing
by Virginia Tech, Clemson embarks on its ACC schedule with a poor
track record in recent conference openers. The Tigers are 1-5 in
their last six, breaking the drought with a 19-17 win over N.C.
State last year. But Clemson is 15-2 all-time at Virginia. ...
``Our team was crushed, but I don't sense any sulking about it,''
head coach Tommy West said of the Virginia Tech debacle. ... The
injury list is long heading into Saturday's game, and two starting
linebackers are questionable: O.J. Childress (pulled hamstring) and
Kenzi Ross (pulled leg muscle). Reserve DB Darrel Crutchfield
didn't play last week because of a sprained knee, but DE Adrian
Dingle is probable after hyperextending his knee.
</P>
<P>
   DUKE at Florida State, Saturday, 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, a Duke-Florida State game would get little
attention, but the Blue Devils' 44-10 win last week against
Northwestern, coupled with FSU's stunning 24-7 upset at the hands
of N.C. State, makes things more interesting. Duke coach Fred
Goldsmith says this is the best team he's had since 1994. FSU coach
Bobby Bowden agrees. ``This is the best our execution has been in
four years, too,'' Goldsmith said. ``But we're not naive. The
supreme test comes in Tallahassee.'' Quarterback Spencer Romine has
yet to commit a turnover in Duke's two wins, and Goldsmith points
to that as the most important statistic. ``That's everything in
football,'' he said. ``In 1994, we were second in the country in
turnover ratio. Turnovers were obviously a problem for Florida
State last Saturday against N.C. State.''
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA STATE vs. Duke, Saturday, 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Chris Weinke has had a good week of practice since
throwing six interceptions against N.C. State last week, but coach
Bobby Bowden said, ``He did well before the last game in practice.
It's a matter of getting his confidence back. You never know what's
going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden says the Seminole players haven't lost confidence in
Weinke. ``I can guarantee you none of them have lost any confidence
in him,'' he said. ``You know why? Because there's not a one of
them who can look at him and say, `Hey, I did good. You did bad.'
It was a total team loss.'' ... The Seminoles will face the Blue
Devils without starting nose guard Larry Smith and probably without
middle linebacker Brian Allen, because of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   MARYLAND at West Virginia, Saturday, 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Terrapins gained 266 rushing yards _ tying last season's
best single-game output _ against Virginia's vaunted defense but
committed three critical turnovers in a 31-19 loss. Trailing 17-3,
Maryland bounced back, after ailing TB LaMont Jordan came off the
bench and picked up 88 yards on 23 carries and caught three passes
for another 31 yards. ``I was proud of the way we responded, and I
thought we moved the ball well,'' head coach Ron Vanderlinden said.
``But the bottom line is we didn't win the game.'' ...Maryland has
lost seven games in a row to Division I-A opponents.... Leading
receiver Jermaine Arrington (sprained ankle) and starting OG Eric
Timothy (knee), who didn't play against Virginia, are questionable.
</P>
<P>
   NORTH CAROLINA at Stanford, Saturday, 6:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar Davenport will dress for the Stanford game, but the senior
quarterback will be used only in an emergency. ``Oscar practiced
this week and he's not favoring the leg like he was. In an
emergency, he could play,'' coach Carl Torbush said. The Heels will
be without three other top offensive players. Tight end Alge
Crumpler and tailback Rufus Brown are out with injuries and
projected starting tailback Domonique Williams has been declared
academically ineligible. ... Cornerback Dre Bly enters the game
tied for the career ACC interception mark, the longest-standing
individual career record in the conference. Bly grabbed his 17th
against Miami of Ohio. The record was set by Maryland's Tom Brown,
1960-62.N.C. STATE at Baylor, Saturday, 12:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Head coach Mike O'Cain isn't letting Saturday's shocking upset
of Florida State get in the way of his worries about his team's
first road game of the season. ``It was a great win for us, but it
doesn't automatically propel us to where we want to be,'' he said.
... N.C. State jumped to No. 20 in this week's AP rankings, its
highest since finishing the 1994 season at No. 17 after winning the
Peach Bowl. ... With all the attention paid to WR Torry Holt, the
play of QB Jamie Barnette has been overshadowed a bit. In 16
college starts, Barnette has thrown for 200 yards or more 12 times
and has thrown for two TDs or more in each of his last six outings.
... The defense leads the country with nine interceptions,
including six against FSU's Chris Weinke, is second in passing
efficiency defense and third in turnover margin.
</P>
<P>
   VIRGINIA vs. Clemson, Saturday, 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1990, Clemson could mark this game up automatically as a
win. The Tigers led the series 29-0. In the eight games since,
Virginia has won four and tied one, and it's favored in this one.
But coach George Welsh says he hasn't used ``the Streak'' as a
motivating tool in getting his team ready for Saturday. ``I didn't
get into anything before we won that game in 1990,'' Welsh said.
``I mentioned how we played the last two years (with one win and
one loss)), that's all.''...Virginia's offensive threat lies in the
hands of quarterback Aaron Brooks. ``He always had talent,'' Welsh
said. ``He's probably half-a-second faster this season in making
decisions than he was last year. Our team respects him. He doesn't
say much, but he leads by example. They elected him captain.''

   WAKE FOREST at. Clemson, Sept. 26
</P>
<P>
   After losing 42-0 to Air Force and having to come from behind to
beat Navy last Thursday, Jim Caldwell says his Demon Deacons looked
forward to this off week before they travel to Clemson on Sept. 26.
Inside linebacker Kelvin Moses, will be back from a knee injury.
Quarterback Brian Kuklick should be 100 percent after being slowed
by a knee injury. ... Caldwell says prospects for his team, which
was ranked No. 22 before the season by Sports Illustrated, depend
on Kuklick's ability to get the ball to receivers Jammie Deese and
Desmond Clark. Clark needs only 29 more receptions to become the
all-time leading career pass receiver in the ACC. ``We're biased,
because there are a lot of good receivers in the league, but I
think they're among the best,'' Caldwell said.

   ALABAMA at Arkansas, Sept. 26
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight week, running back Shaun Alexander was
named the SEC's Offensive Player of the Week. Alexander ran for 206
yards and three touchdowns in a 32-7 win over Vanderbilt. In two
games, Alexander has 326 yards rushing and eight touchdowns. ...
Coach Mike DuBose hopes he'll have the luxury of redshirting
freshman quarterback Tyler Watts but wonders if the Crimson Tide
can get through the season with just two quarterbacks, J.D.
Phillips and Andrew Zow. ``I'll be surprised if we don't play
Tyler,'' DuBose said. ``But ideally, we won't.'' ... Alabama has
started 2-0 in each of the past seven seasons. The last time the
Crimson Tide failed to start 2-0 was 1991. Alabama finished that
year 11-1.
</P>
<P>
   ARKANSAS vs. SMU, Saturday, 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   A sellout is expected for the 50th anniversary _ to the week _
of Arkansas' first game in Little Rock's War Memorial Stadium.
Members of that 1948 team have been invited back to relive the
memory of the opener, a 40-6 win over Abilene Christian. ...
meeting NCAA academic requirements, took an exam in a World
Literature I class on Wednesday. It might be more challenging than
the course load of AIDS, golf and music appreciation that
All-America linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer took to remain eligible at
Ohio State, but the timing is a little puzzling: Bradley took World
Lit II last year. ... The Razorbacks haven't beaten SMU in their
last two meetings, including a 31-9 loss a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   AUBURN vs. LSU, Saturday, 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Terry Bowden said he'd be surprised if Saturday's game
with LSU isn't close. Seven of the last eight meetings have been
decided by less than a touchdown. The last four have been decided
by an average of 4.3 points. ... Auburn used six running backs last
week against Ole Miss, led by freshman Michael Burks with 22 rushes
for 61 yards. Running back Demontray Carter is now at 100 percent,
but Burks will start. ... Auburn will still be without centers Cole
Cubelic and Mike Pucillo, who had surgery to repair bones in their
feet. Senior Karl Lavine will start, backed up by true freshman Ben
Nowland. ... Auburn's 17-0 win over Ole Miss last week was its
first SEC shutout in almost nine years. It has won all six of its
SEC openers under Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA at Tennessee, Saturday, 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Punter Robby Stevenson is out for the season with Graves'
disease, an ailment that effects the thyroid. ... Freshman running
back Earnest Graham underwent surgery Monday to repair a stress
fracture in his right foot. He is expected to receive a medical
redshirt and have four years of eligibility remaining. ... Ryan
Kalich, who missed the first two games with a dislocated toe, will
start at left guard against Tennessee. ... Running back Terry
Jackson, who sat out the second half against Northeast Louisiana
last week with a sore back, has recovered. ... Florida's nine
turnovers in two games is second worst in the nation behind
Nevada's 10. ``If we don't do a better job of taking care of the
ball, we will be in a lot of trouble up there,'' coach Steve
Spurrier said.
</P>
<P>
   KENTUCKY vs. Indiana, Saturday, 1:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a 52-7 romp over Eastern Kentucky, head coach Hal Mumme
wasn't happy with his offense, particularly the running game.
``We've probably played the worst run-blocking game since I've been
here,'' Mumme said. ``I'm as displeased as I've been here, but the
expectation level is a lot higher than it was last year.'' ... On
the other hand, the defense keeps improving. The 184 yards allowed
was the first time Kentucky has kept an opponent under 200 since
Mumme arrived last year. ... Indiana's 587 yards in its season
opener places it second in the country in total offense _ behind
Kentucky. ... After completing passes to nine different receivers
last week, five of whom scored, QB Tim Couch said, ``We just feel
that we can score every time we get the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   LSU at Auburn, Saturday, 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   LSU's defense will keep a close eye on Auburn running back
Michael Burks, a native of Kenner, La. He was not heavily recruited
by LSU because the Tigers were so deep at running back. ...
Quarterback Herb Tyler has a career completion percentage of 60.0.
He needs only six completions to reach the minimum of 300 necessary
to be counted among the SEC's career leaders in that category. ...
LSU defensive end Jarvis Green says he's looking forward to
Saturday. Green allegedly was punched in the face by Auburn
defensive end Jeff Dunlap when Green was on his Auburn recruiting
trip in 1997. Green said he had to be treated by a dentist in
Auburn the next day and couldn't eat for a week. Auburn coach Terry
Bowden later apologized for the incident.
</P>
<P>
   MISSISSIPPI at Vanderbilt, Saturday, 12:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Tommy Tuberville says this week has been spent rebuilding
the confidence of quarterback Romaro Miller, who struggled in last
week's 17-0 loss to Auburn. ``He had just about everything thrown
at him, and that was a first,'' Tuberville said about Miller, who
completed only 11 of 35 passes for 104 yards. Miller hit 26 of 40
passes for 332 yards and two touchdowns in the opener against
Memphis. ... Tuberville said he is expecting a different Vanderbilt
defense than the one that has given up 74 points in its first two
games. ``They did a lot of blitzing, but now I sense they are going
back to the basics,'' he said. ... Tight end Rufus French has six
catches for 52 yards, ranking him second in the nation among tight
ends in receptions.
</P>
<P>
   MISSISSIPPI STATE at Oklahoma State, Saturday, 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Head coach Jackie Sherrill was effusive this week in his praise
for RB James Johnson, who has scored seven TDs in his last 11
games. Sherrill assigned an assistant to determine how much of
Johnson's yardage has come on second effort. He was pleased to
discover that the number totaled 182 of Johnson's 303 thus far. ...
Perhaps the most impressive part of Johnson's 62-yard TD run
against Memphis was that he plowed right over a defensive back on
his way to the end zone. ... The Bulldogs escaped with a 14-6 win
despite poor showings from both their platooning quarterbacks.
Starter Matt Wyatt was just 6-for-17 for 53 yards and reserve Wayne
Madkin tallied just 16 yards. ``We have to play better in that
position,'' Sherrill said.SOUTH CAROLINA vs. Marshall, Saturday, 7
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina has had two season-ending injuries in its
secondary. Safety Arturo Freeman, an All-SEC candidate, suffered a
major knee injury in the preseason. Last Saturday night against
Georgia, redshirt freshman Andre Goodman seriously hurt his knee in
the first half. That becomes a major concern with Marshall and
All-Southern Conference quarterback Chad Pennington coming to
Columbia on Saturday night. ``This is a major challenge for our
football team,'' said head coach Brad Scott. ``I'm not looking
forward to playing this football team, I can tell you that.''...
Scott said that he didn't have to worry about his players getting
overconfident after last week's 17-3 loss to Georgia. ``I don't
think we have an overinflated opinion of ourselves right now.''
</P>
<P>
   TENNESSEE vs. Florida, Saturday, 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA has granted an eligibility waiver to Rashad Moore, a
6-4, 275-pound prospect from Huntsville, Ala. Moore has been
conditionally admitted pending completion of high school graduation
requirements. He cannot play but can practice and receive financial
aid. ... Freshman Bernard Jackson has been moved from linebacker to
defensive end and could get some playing time against Florida. ...
Tennessee is 77-19-4 in home-openers, including 11-2-1 the past 14
years. ... Knoxville officials warn that traffic around Neyland
Stadium will be worse than normal for Saturday's game, because of
construction work. ... Since the SEC split into divisions in 1992,
Tennessee is 24-6 in the SEC East. Five of the losses are to
Florida; the other was to South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   VANDERBILT vs. Mississippi, Saturday, 12:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Commodores appear to have settled on freshman Dave Wallace
as their starting quarterback, but he's unlikely to be an easy
answer on a team needing improvement in numerous areas. Wallace was
sacked eight times by Alabama on Saturday. ``Quick finishes, quick
turnarounds, those are all in storybooks,'' offensive coordinator
Steve Crosby said. ``That doesn't happen.'' ... What's more
puzzling for head coach Woody Widenhofer is the play of his prized
defense, which has given up 74 points in two games. Alabama RB
Shaun Alexander ran up 206 yards. ``We've made so many mental
errors our first two games that we've given up some big plays,''
Widenhofer said. ``I'm looking for a major improvement Saturday.''

QUESTIONS RAISED ABOUT RELEASE OF GRAND JURY VIDEOTAPE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to tighten language throughout)  (See also: CLINTON-DAY, CLINTON-CONGRESS, CLINTON-HAVEL,
CLINTON-DEMS, CLINTON-COUNSEL, CLINTON-DONORS, CLINTON-JONES,
CLINTON-RELEASE, CLINTON-TEXT) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The possibility that a videotape of President
Clinton's grand jury testimony will be made public is expanding a
debate about whether the investigation of the president may be
eroding centuries-old rules guaranteeing secrecy and other
protections for witnesses at grand jury proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   In general in American law, grand jury testimony is kept secret
to aid prosecutors while they conduct their investigations and to
protect people who are investigated from allegations that may be
little more than rumor or innuendo.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Clinton tape, a complicated legal discussion
about the extent to which grand jury secrecy rules might apply in
impeachment proceedings has been made more complex by the unique
twist that Clinton's lawyers permitted his testimony to be
videotaped, so that any jurors absent that day could view it later.
As nervous White House advisers have suggested this week, the
flesh-and-blood picture of Clinton drawing fine distinctions as he
is asked about sexual encounters with an intern may be more
damaging than any transcript.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats on Capitol Hill have suggested that a release of
Clinton's testimony would appear to be a ``partisan, vindictive
approach,'' that would not be used against any other American, as
Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, of the House Judiciary Committee,
said.
</P>
<P>
   Release of the Clinton videotape, Rep. Jim Moran, D-Va., said
Wednesday, ``would say if you become involved in a political case,
you can forget about due process rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, we're establishing one more horrible precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   There are indications the public may agree. A CBS poll released
Wednesday found that 70 percent of Americans _ and even a majority
of Republicans _ think it is not necessary for the House to release
the tape-recorded testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But some Republicans in Congress have argued that it would be
irresponsible to, in effect, suppress the critical evidence in the
impeachment inquiry: the president's testimony in which the
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, asserts that Clinton committed
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   The tape recording, said Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., of the Judiciary
Committee, ``helps to guage the intent'' of the president as he
testified. Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., chairman of the House
Republican Policy Committee, said Wednesday that the tape was a
central piece of evidence. ``The president's credibility is the
issue,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say Congress has authority to release the tape if
it votes to do so. The constitutional separation of powers means
that no court would likely consider an appeal of any step Congress
takes in an impeachment proceeding. The White House lawyers have
not argued the House is legally barred from releasing the
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference Wednesday, Clinton said he expected his
testimony to be released even though he thought at the time that
there were rules prohibiting release. But he said the decision was
for Congress to make.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts were divided about whether the release of
Clinton's testimony would be shattering to notions of grand jury
secrecy. Several legal experts said that, while there are strict
rules requiring that grand jury testimony remain secret during an
investigation, it is common for some portions of grand jury
testimony to be revealed during trials. Typically, for example,
trial witnesses are confronted with portions of their grand jury
testimony when lawyers assert that differences in their testimony
show they are not telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the public thinks that whatever anybody says in a grand
jury is secret forever, that is simply not the case,'' said James
Felman, a Tampa, Fla., lawyer who is an expert on impeachment law.
</P>
<P>
   Although grand jury secrecy is an important principle, several
experts said, it is a flexible rule that permits some exceptions
during the trial phase of cases. Sara Sun Beale, a Duke University
School of Law professor and the author of a treatise on grand jury
law, said the legal test in an ordinary trial is whether there was
a ``particularized need'' for release of the testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers said the release of a full tape of the president's
testimony raised different issues than the more typical release of
selected portions of transcribed testimony after a trial had
already begun. Some legal experts said the release would create an
atmosphere of unfairness against the president that was difficult
to justify.
</P>
<P>
   But other legal experts said that it was impossible to argue
that the release of the videotape would violate some fundamental
constitutional principle because impeachment is a unique process.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a political process,'' said Phillip Johnson, an expert
on criminal law at the University of California at Berkeley Law
School. ``I think it's just inevitable that you're going to have to
let people look at the president's testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   But several legal experts said that, though release of the
testimony would be legal, they had deep concerns about the message
such a release would communicate to Americans about grand jury
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the public took from this the idea that the principle of
grand jury secrecy isn't being observed, there would be a lot of
damage from that,'' said Ms. Beale.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the legal analysis, many of the legal experts said, was a
much more practical issue. If the president's lawyers had not
acquiesced in the idea of taping the president's testimony, there
would be no tape that was destined to find its way to television.

DECLINE IN DISTRESSED SALES   HELPS SPUR CALIFORNIA HOUSING MARKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Fewer distressed sales and a rekindling of equity
are adding up to make 1998 one of the best housing markets on
record, a trade group has said.
</P>
<P>
   The end result is ``for sale'' signs are staying up for a
shorter duration this year than any time since 1989 as the spread
between the asking price and sale price narrows, according to this
year's version of the California Housing Finance Survey by the
California Association of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homes are selling faster and at a smaller discount than at any
other time since the 1980s,'' Los Angeles Realtor Tim Corliss, the
trade group's president, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the median price discount, the difference between
the initial asking price and final sale price, was 1.6 percent when
the survey was conducted this summer. That's the lowest margin
since the survey began in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, homes stayed on the market an average of four
weeks, the shortest time since 1989, the group said. That's half
the sales time in last year's study.
</P>
<P>
   This year also has seen return buyers flocking back to the
market. Of the homes sold, 58 percent went to repeat buyers. That's
just a little less than the 60 percent recorded last year but more
than in 1996 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1993 and 1995, the state's housing market was dominated
by first-time buyers who flocked to the market as prices fell, in
part because of the large number of distressed sales.
</P>
<P>
   Distressed sales include the selling of repossessed properties,
short sales (in which the home is sold for less than the loan
balance) and sales to stave off foreclosure. They accounted for 8.3
percent of this year's purchases, down from 13.2 percent in 1997,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   G.U. Krueger, the association's deputy chief economist, said the
annual report is a snapshot of how the state's real estate market
will perform throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   It shows a definite build up of equity. The median price
statewide in the 1998 survey was $205,000, an increase of 7.9
percent from a year ago. And the increasing equity can be found
across the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest appreciation clearly is in Northern California but
from other data we have from around the state is that it has
clearly moved to Southern California,'' said Krueger.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Orange County may supplant Santa Clara County in terms
of prices gains and Los Angeles County is approaching double-digit
growth, he said.

GERALDINE FERRARO: 14 YEARS LATER, A POLITICAL HEROINE'S LAST
HURRAH 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: also moved in `a' category) 
(bl) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Ger-RY! Ger-RY! Ger-RY!''
</P>
<P>
   As Geraldine Ferraro entered a ballroom at the Regency Hotel on
Tuesday night, the chant resounded again. Fourteen years earlier,
thousands of Democrats had rocked their party's national convention
in San Francisco with her name for a full eight minutes after she
was nominated for vice president.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, at the end of her nine-month campaign for the
Democratic nomination to the Senate, there were only about 80
supporters, and within seconds, the room went quiet: Ferraro had a
concession speech to make.
</P>
<P>
   With that speech, delivered just over an hour after the polls
had shut, Ferraro ended a singular political career, one that
embodied both the promise and elusiveness of equal representation
by women, and one that may ultimately be remembered for its defeats
as much as its successes.
</P>
<P>
   If Ferraro's rise was meteoric, her political career's
denouement was protracted, often agonizing, and, at first glance,
baffling. After starting this Senate race 25 points ahead in the
polls in January, she instead lost by 25 points, garnering only 26
percent of the vote to Rep. Charles Schumer's 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Ferraro was a victim partly of her opponent's
hunger, skill, and avid fund raising. But even some of her
supporters had to allow that she had misread the political waters.
She seemed to believe that her celebrity would carry her to
victory, but she did not build the credibility to go with it. She
had represented the country's _ and her party's _ aspirations at a
certain place and time, and she did not reinvent herself for a very
different political era.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her time had come and gone,'' said former Mayor Edward Koch,
who is supporting Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato. ``But nobody I
know, including myself, ever has the realistic view of what's
happening when you're in the center of a hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   As Walter Mondale's vice presidential running mate in 1984,
Ferraro had become a historic figure, frozen in many voters' minds
as the spirited, fast-talking, trail-blazing congresswoman from
Queens. With her stint as a host on ``Crossfire,'' she had become
as much of television personality as a politician: A whole
generation knew her only as the woman who ``put Pat in his place,''
as one young man said in reference to her conservative co-host,
Patrick Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was her job during the campaign to fill in the blanks _
define herself better for people _ so they would vote for her as
opposed to just knowing her as an historic figure or a popular
figure,'' said David Eichenbaum, who managed her campaign for six
months before leaving by mutual agreement in July.
</P>
<P>
   She apparently did not succeed. For a good many voters, she
simply seemed to be ``out of the loop,'' as Mike Hellstrom, 32, a
construction worker and labor organizer, put it at last Saturday's
Labor Day parade. Even women, who constituted 56 percent of the
primary vote, repudiated her, voting for Schumer by a margin of 47
to 34 percent according to exit polls.
</P>
<P>
   The deciding factor in the race, of course, was Schumer's huge
financial advantage _ he raised $13 million for the race, more than
five times as much as Ferraro, and blanketed the state with
television advertising. ``Money, money, money,'' said Liz Abzug,
the daughter of the late Rep. Bella Abzug and a Ferraro supporter,
explaining why Ferraro lost.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro was trying to raise money in a year where Democrats are
in tight races across the country, and in an age where female
candidates are, if not common, not the novelty they once were.
</P>
<P>
   But her fund-raising problems also suggest that the kleig lights
of celebrity blinded her to political reality. Her Cuomoesque
deliberations about whether to run kept her out of the race until
January, far too little time to close the fund-raising gap. The
question is why she waited so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``She honestly believed she didn't need to get in any sooner,
considering her standing and name recognition and how easy she felt
it would be to raise money,'' said Eichenbaum. ``In hindsight _
which is always 20-20 _ that was the biggest miscalculation.''
</P>
<P>
   And once she was on the campaign trail, Ferraro sometimes seemed
to mistake the widespread recognition and ample affection she
encountered for political support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have any doubt about how those people in there are
voting?'' she said icily after a visit to a Harlem senior center,
when a reporter asked how she knew her support was so strong when
her campaign had not polled voters for months. She and aides said
repeatedly that they did not need to convince voters that she was
the best choice so much as get them to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   In the waning days of her last campaign, Ferraro often invoked
her first one, when in 1978 as a politically unknown prosecutor she
captured the 9th Congressional District seat in Queens and began
what seemed to be a charmed career.
</P>
<P>
   With the support of House Speaker Tip O' Neill, she quickly rose
to key positions in the House and Democratic Party leadership. And
in 1984, with women's political power in the ascendancy, and the
ticket in need of a Northeastern ethnic, she was nominated for vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   She was unknown, but also funny and direct, steely and
down-to-earth, a tough pol and a good mother. But soon, allegations
were made that her husband had made illegitimate loans to himself
and overestimated the value of his property surfaced, and that he
had ties to organized crime. Ferraro was subjected to what she said
was unprecedented scrutiny. The Mondale-Ferraro ticket lost
resoundingly, amid questions about whether she had hurt the ticket
rather than helped it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ferraro's status as an inspiration, a symbol, and a
canvas for American attitudes about women and politics, was
cemented, although she did not run for office again for eight
years. In her political exile, she cut a Diet Pepsi commercial,
wrote a book, and joined a law firm, until 1991, when she declared
her Senate candidacy. In a vicious four-way primary in which most
of the vitriol was directed at her, the allegations about her
family surfaced again, and she lost by 11,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was not running this year to avenge that loss. Yet
whether it was from arrogance or ambivalence, she often seemed a
reluctant candidate. Her opponents were renowned flesh-pressers.
Ferraro, in contrast, usually waited to be recognized. After a
Harlem appearance, she bought vegetables at a stand rather than
greeting passers-by; at the New York State Fair in Syracuse, she
perused quilts and horses rather than introducing herself to new
voters.
</P>
<P>
   But something else seemed to be at work. Asked Monday why she
had waited so long to get into the race, Ferraro said, among other
reasons, ``Things were going great. I had to give up a lot in order
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides her lucrative ``Crossfire'' post and time with her
family, she once again gave up her privacy. While this campaign
dredged up none of the dirty laundry about her family's finances,
Ferraro often seemed on the defensive, wary of the media that she
needed to get her message out.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, she was practically sprinting through Bryant Park _
with a press pack at her heels _ to escape questions about her
slide in the polls. When an aide failed to hail a cab, she stepped
into the street to do it herself.
</P>
<P>
   By the end Ferraro's campaign seemed to be unraveling, and so
did her confidence. The woman who in 1984 had warned George Bush
not to patronize her seemed to be conceding the race, joking about
her post-campaign plans. Aides said privately that she wanted
``resolution,'' that she wanted to either get on with challenging
Senator D'Amato _ or get on with her life.
</P>
<P>
   Now, having said that she would seek no future elected office,
she is free to do just that. She has written a new book, with
Catherine Whitney, called ``Framing A Life: A Family Memoir,''
about four generations of women in her family and the immigrant
experience. Now she will have time to promote it.
</P>
<P>
   And so while some supporters are angry at what they call
Schumer's ``buying'' of the primary, most seem resigned to the
judgment the voters had rendered. Winning would have been great,
they say, but when it comes to talk of a political legacy, what
matters is that Ferraro played the game.
</P>
<P>
   Anita Perez Ferguson, the president of the National Women's
Political Caucus, praised Ferraro's willingness to twice enter
fierce primary battles in her Senate races, something, she said
that women are often loathe to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``This woman has probably been more of an opinion maker than
most people sitting for six terms straight in the House of
Representatives or Senate,'' she said. ``Her attempts, and even her
losses, have accomplished far beyond what others have accomplished
by winning.''

 &HT;    Tennessee less complacent
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Knoxville, Tenn. -- Behind the scenes as this town gets ready
for Saturday night's showdown between No. 2 Florida and No. 6
Tennessee:
</P>
<P>
   With the benefit of hindsight, Tennessee's players now admit
that at times over the past four years, the presence of quarterback
Peyton Manning made them complacent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, when you have one guy who gets all that
attention, you sometimes kind of sit back and wait for him to make
something happen,'' wide receiver Peerless Price said. ``And the
thing with Peyton is that he almost always made a play.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude has changed now that Manning's gone. Each
Tennessee player feels he has a job to do or the offense won't
succeed. That, they said, bodes well for the team against Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we don't have any stars on this team,'' wide receiver
Jeremaine Copeland said, ``so everbody has to pull together to make
this thing work. Nobody can slack off.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's my imagination, but the Tennessee players and coaches
appear more relaxed this week than before previous Florida games.
The players said coach Phillip Fulmer set the tone when he gave the
team last weekend off. In previous years when Tennessee had an open
date before Florida, the Vols would spend that Saturday on the
practice field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody feels loose and confident,'' running back Jamal
Lewis said. ``This time last year, it was pretty intense. This
time, we're just going about our business.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer says he likes the attitude of this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has just been a fun group of guys to work with,'' he
said. ``They work hard and they work together. It's a tight-knit
bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for an indicator on how the game will go, pay
attention in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In four of the past five games, all won by Florida, Tennessee
has failed to score in the first quarter. The Gators have outscored
the Vols 52-13 in the first quarters of the five games.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's 18 turnovers have been key in the past five games.
Florida took those 18 turnovers and turned them into 55 points. In
the last three years, Tennessee has 13 turnovers and those were
turned into seven Florida touchdowns. The average scoring drive for
Florida after a Tennessee turnover has been 1.6 plays.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five wins over Tennessee, Florida has outrushed the
Volunteers 738-322. Tennessee actually has more total yards than
the Gators (2,093-2,069) and has run 23 more offensive plays
(370-347). Turnovers and Tennessee's inability to run the ball (2.3
average per carry) have been the difference.
</P>
<P>
   OUTSIDE THE LINES
</P>
<P>
   Cotton Bowl deal near, SEC commissioner says
</P>
<P>
   SEC Commissioner Roy Kramer says a deal between the conference
and the Cotton Bowl could come together in the next couple of
weeks. Kramer is making the rounds of talking to the other bowls
with SEC tie-ins, trying to convince them the deal will be good for
everybody involved. Several of the bowls, including Atlanta's
Peach, are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   Now we know why an all SEC officiating crew worked the
Syracuse-Tennessee game Sept. 5. Tennessee won 34-33 after a
controversial pass-interference call, raising some eyebrows,
particular by Syracuse fans. Tennessee insisted on an allSEC crew
because when Syracuse comes to Knoxville in 2000, split-crews, made
up of officials from both conferences, no longer will be allowed. A
Big East crew will work the game in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Central Florida are convinced Saturday's nationally
televised game with Purdue could jump-start the darkhorse Heisman
candidacy of quarterback Daunte Culpepper. After two games,
Culpepper is second in the nation in total offense (459 yards per
game) and third in passing efficiency (205.1 rating).For Darion
Hutcherson, it's been a long road from Atlanta's Douglass High to
South Carolina. Hutcherson didn't qualify academically to enroll in
1997, so he went to work loading trucks in the day and studying to
improve his SAT score at night. He made the score and as a freshman
this season was the backup to linebacker Corey Atkins. When Atkins
was hurt against Georgia onSaturday, Hutcherson came in the game
and made eight tackles. He will get his first career start against
Marshall this Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   THEY SAID IT
</P>
<P>
   Cranking up the quote machine
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, the old quote machine has been working overtime
this week:
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a case of me having too much adrenaline because I
was fired up. The biggest thing for me to do is calm down and
relax.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Florida State quarterback Chris Weinke on why he threw six
interceptions in Saturday's loss to N.C. State
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the fun part of the game, when somebody wants to win,
when somebody's trying in their heart to win, and you just go out
and take it from them. That's like slitting their throat.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Florida linebacker Johnny Rutledge on Saturday's game with
Tennessee
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not down. I'm mad.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Michigan coach Lloyd Carr on the Wolverines' 0-2 start.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have a letdown, I give up. I'll resign.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Virginia coach George Welsh, saying his No. 10 team will be
ready to play against Clemson on Saturday
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to stand on my head and eat bugs and shave my
hair or anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer on how he has no special plans
to get his team up for Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our fingerprints are on this thing.''
</P>

being ranked No. 8 in the preseason polls

SEATTLE COMPANY WINS PRELIMINARY OK FOR ARTHRITIS DRUG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seattle-based Immunex Corp. won preliminary government approval
Wednesday for what could become its first blockbuster product, a
drug called Enbrel that promises relief for the 2.1 million
Americans who suffer from rheumatoid arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   With a favorable recommendation Wednesday from a U.S. Food and
Drug Arthritis Advisory Committee panel, the drug is expected to
win final FDA approval, and could be available as a prescription
medicine as early as November. The FDA frequently follows the
recommendations of its advisory committees.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have estimated the market for arthritis drugs at
between about $500 million and $1 billion a year. Rheumatoid
arthritis, which can cripple patients within 10 years, is an
autoimmune disease that causes painful swelling in the joints. It
is different than osteoarthritis, which is caused by wear-and-tear
on the joints.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recommendations of the FDA Advisory Committee are an
encouraging signal to many Americans trying to manage this
debilitating disease,'' said Peggy Phillips, senior vice president
of pharmaceutical development at Immunex.
</P>
<P>
   The Advisory Committee recommended the drug for use by patients
with advanced disease. About 500,000 Americans have severe
rheumatoid arthritis that has not responded to other forms of
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time I was taking 16 pills a day,'' Gloria Baswell of
Gadsden, Ala., told the panel. ``Nothing worked.
</P>
<P>
   Baswell, who started taking Enbrel two years ago, no longer
needs even over-the-counter painkillers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my miracle,'' she said. ``I know what hell is like, and I
know how good it is to come out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rheumatoid arthritis strikes three times as many women as men,
usually between the ages 25 and 50. Symptoms, which may develop
within weeks or months, include redness, warmth and swelling of the
joints, especially the small joints of the hands and feet. The
symptoms usually occur on both sides of the body. In addition to
prolonged morning stiffness, they can cause major fatigue. About
half of patients with rheumatoid arthritis are unable to work
within 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The data show that Enbrel provides relief of symptoms for many
rheumatoid arthritis patients, many of whom have not been treated
successfully with other drugs or cannot tolerate the side effects
associated with some current medications,'' said Dr. Larry W.
Moreland, of the division of Immunology and Rheumatology at the
University of Alabama at Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   The current standard treatment for advanced rheumatoid arthritis
is methotrexate, a chemotherapeutic agent that works by killing
immune system cells. However, methotrexate can cause side effects,
including nausea and liver damage.
</P>
<P>
   If licensed by the FDA, Enbrel would be the first entirely new
approach to treating the disease approved in the last 15 years, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   Enbrel is a biological molecule, called ``Tumor Necrosis Factor
Receptor, that appears naturally in the body. It acts by mopping up
excess amounts of ``tumor necrosis factor,'' an immune system
protein that causes inflammation. Too much tumor necrosis factor
leads to joint damage.
</P>
<P>
   In clinical studies with Enbrel, more than 80 percent of
patients who had been on the drug for a year experienced relief,
according to Immunex spokesperson Cathy Keck Anderson. The study
evaluated the drug's effect on the number and severity of swollen
joints, as well as an on the patient's overall ability to function.
</P>
<P>
   Immunex has spent over $150 million developing the drug, and has
already signed a $100 million marketing agreement with American
Home Products Corp. to co-promote the drug. American Home Products
owns a majority interest in Immunex.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, the drug will be marketed by Wyeth-Ayerst
Laboratories, which is American Home Product's pharmaceutical
division.
</P>
<P>
   If the drug gets to the market by the end of the year, analysts
have said it could make Immunex profitable in 1999 for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   So far, about 1,000 patients have tried the drug, which is
injected twice a week with a needle similar to that used by a
diabetic to inject insulin. More than 100 have been on the drug for
15 months or more.
</P>
<P>
   The company is continuing to do studies to determine whether the
drug can curb the progression of the disease over the long-term.
</P>
<P>
   So far, side effects have been limited primarily to tenderness
around the area of the shot, according to data presented to the
FDA.
</P>
<P>
   Immunex' share price closed Wednesday at 58 1/8, down 3 1/8. The
stock was trading at 50 5/8 at the end of August.

POLITICS INTRUDES ON MULTICULTURAL DANCE FESTIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: repeating to fix slug; sent earlier as FRANCE-DANCE-FEST)  (smw) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYONS, France _ The Lyons Dance Biennial, arguably Europe's most
important dance festival, has started with a political bang and a
hot-tempered debate on multiculturalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mediterranea'' is the title of this year's event, and as usual
the 14-year-old biennial differs from other dance festivals by
offering a historical overview of dance in a single country or in
theme-related regions.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks of performances by traditional and experimental
troupes from Spain to Israel, by way of Italy and North Africa,
might conjure up visions of sun and surf, but actually the
festival's Mediterranean motif has made for some troubled waters.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, or precisely, not the National Front, France's
extreme-right political party, thinks that cultures rooted around
the shores of the Mediterranean are worth celebrating, especially
if their peoples (some dark-skinned) share a propensity for
emigrating to France.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a $70,000 subsidy for a three-hour parade organized by
the biennial on Sunday as a huge and vibrant tribute to
multiculturalism was voted down in July by the regional government
of Lyons. Charles Millon, the president of that body, the
Rhone-Alpes Regional Council, was elected with National Front
support and did not oppose the party's attack on the parade.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Vial, a National Front member of the council and first
vice president of its cultural commission, called the Mediterranean
theme ``pernicious'' and the parade an effort to condition people
mentally to ``glorify the theme of a multicultural and multiethnic
society'' that promotes ``a cultural mix.''
</P>
<P>
   Vial used ``metissage,'' which can connote miscegenation, as a
word for ``mix.'' His remarks, rebutted on national television by
Guy Darmet, the biennial's artistic director, warned of a
``cultural colonization'' of France that was taking place ``under
the name of immigration.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, and despite a brutally cold rain, the parade took
place as scheduled on Sunday. Actually a vast outreach project that
sent choreographers into 20 Arab and immigrant communities around
Lyons to train 3,000 participants, the event included Macedonian
and Israeli dances, hip-hop and African dances performed by
interracial groups.
</P>
<P>
   The parade ended on a triumphal note. As the marchers and
dancers, mostly young, reached Lyons' main square, the Place
Bellecour, the sun broke out over its equestrian statue of Louis
XIV and created a rainbow, a symbol of the message of tolerance
that Darmet has made the biennial's leitmotif.
</P>
<P>
   It was no accident that the national government sent its big
guns to the festival's gala opening last Thursday. Catherine
Trautmann, the minister of culture, went out of her way to attend a
rehearsal for the parade before going to the performance, an
eclectic range of song and dance, with Jean-Jack Queyranne, the
acting minister of the interior.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Barre, the mayor of Lyons and a former prime minister
whose parliamentary group has just excluded Millon, sat with the
ministers. Parliament members from the area also attended, as did
the Turkish ambassador and 10 other high-ranking diplomats whose
countries are represented in the festival.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to say that any international festival is a
multicultural event. But context is everything. The paradox is that
the biennial became embroiled in racial and political tensions on
the domestic front while things went smoothly on the international
level.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese government, usually reluctant to participate in
events with Israeli groups, allowed the Ballets Caracalla, from
Beirut, to perform in a festival with four Israeli modern-dance
troupes. A government-sponsored company of whirling dervishes from
Egypt has also arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries taking part are France, Spain, Italy, Greece,
Morocco, Tunisia and Turkey. Algeria, where civil strife has shut
down professional dance activity, is represented by Algerians
living in France.
</P>
<P>
   The 28 dance troupes in the festival are supplemented by
individual artists, including singers like Houria Aichi, an
Algerian in exile who specializes in women's songs of the Aures
Mountains of Algeria. At the opening night gala, one did not need
to know that her lyrics referred to a woman's losing her child and,
by extension, her country. One was simply moved by her lament,
powerful in its sobbing refrain and ecstatic tone.
</P>
<P>
   The program's other highlight was the joint appearance of three
splendid flamenco Gypsy dancers: Juana Amaya (fiery), La Tolea
(electric) and Manuela Carrasco (imposing). A group of male Gnawas
_ members of a Moroccan minority descended from black slaves _
offered a boisterous circular dance. An Adam-and-Eve duet by the
French choreographer Maguy Marin stood out on its own terms. One
could also manage to see a link between the flamenco dancers'
serpentine arms and those of Haifa Bouzouita, a Tunisian dancer.
</P>
<P>
   Although some folk forms are on display, the experimental dance
groups have, as usual, come to the fore. The most outstanding work
so far is ``Wasla,'' a premiere by Hela Fattoumi and Eric
Lamoureux, who performed at the American Dance Festival in Durham,
N.C., in 1995 and who should be seen in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Tunisia but brought up in France, Ms. Fattoumi begins
the piece with an extraordinary solo that looks abstract but speaks
of the plight of women in Arab society. Initially confined to a
womblike curved space, she plays with angular shifts of weight
before lifting her shirt as a veil to cover her face.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A women's trio and an athletic male quartet speak of homosexual
friendships in a male society that excludes women from equal
discourse. In all, ``Wasla'' is a brilliant work, able to
experiment on two levels, the expressive and the formal.
</P>
<P>
   The festival's big surprise has come from two innovative Greek
modern-dance troupes. Neither is shy about featuring nudity for
dramatic purpose. The Edafos Dance Theater's ``Medea'' suggests a
cinematic dream acted out by chalk-white dancer-mimes who move in
slow motion when not erupting into emotional outbursts. Dimitris
Papaioannou, the director and choreographer, is remarkably coherent
in his style and vision. He may not offer any illuminating insight
into a well-known tale, but he is never off-key in his retelling.
</P>
<P>
   As Jason and Medea on their wedding night, he and Angeliki
Stellatou thrash about on a table with extraordinary passion. After
Jason's infidelity, Medea kills her children by dashing two hand
puppets to smithereens.
</P>
<P>
   Their red innards fall into the ankle-deep pool below, the
``sea'' that Jason, portrayed as a priggish 19th-century admiral,
has crossed. The entire cast's intensity is striking, and the
Callas recordings of Bellini are unexpectedly apt.
</P>
<P>
   Konstantinos Rigos, the director of the Oktana Dance Theater,
the other Greek troupe, uses more conventional dance idioms in
``Five Seasons.'' But here too there are surprises, like the witty
homoerotic gloss on Nijinsky's ``Afternoon of a Faun.'' The
choreography for the three other regular seasons suggests a
balleticized version of Trisha Brown's style. The fifth season may
be set in a dubious future: to the sound of furious techno-rock, a
couple come in with symbols of the past. She carries a hammer, he
has a sickle.
</P>
<P>
   There are no such mysteries in ``Elyssa, the Queen of
Carthage,'' choreographed by Abdel-Halim Caracalla for his Ballets
Caracalla. Complexity yields to straightforward narrative in his
tale of Elyssa, otherwise known as Dido in the West. The dancers,
led by the charismatic Tania Haroun in the title role, are
energetic, moving with amazing speed in Caracalla's fusion of
ballet and modern dance. After Elyssa immolates herself onstage,
the dancers break into a Lebanese folk dance. Caracalla seeks,
above all, to entertain.

ANTHONY WILLIAMS: PRIMARY WINNER RENEWS VOW TO BRING WASHINGTON
TOGETHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: Also moved in `w' file) 
(smw) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Anthony Williams, the government technocrat who
swept to victory on Tuesday in the Democratic primary, began his
campaign for mayor of Washington on Wednesday by renewing his
pledge to bring a sometimes racially divided city back together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not an election about race,'' Williams said of his
overwhelming primary victory, in which he swept both white and
racially mixed areas while drawing well in the black wards. ``We
should be one city.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who is black, spoke at a news conference in a
predominantly black ward that he carried narrowly against
Councilman Kevin Chavous, another black candidate, who finished
second, largely on the strength of black votes.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' appeal to both races was apparent at his victory
celebration Tuesday night at the Washington Hilton Hotel, where at
least half of the 500 cheering supporters were white. People
working in his campaign said he would do well among both white and
black voters in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will dominate the black vote and he'll do very well in the
white community as well,'' said Peter Edelman, a Democratic leader
and Williams supporter.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Marion Barry, who has dominated Washington politics for
the last 20 years, did not seek re-election. He did not endorse any
candidate in the primary, but he appeared at Williams' victory
party and then did the rounds of the 11 o'clock television news
programs, declaring his support for Williams. Even with the city
effectively being run by a federally appointed control board
because of a near collapse of municipal services and huge district
deficits, Barry is still a commanding presence in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Edelman and others see a contest in which Williams will carry
most of the black vote and also do well against his main opponent,
Carol Schwartz, a white Republican, in competition for the white
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Williams carried Ward 3, a predominantly white and affluent
swath of the west side of Washington that includes Georgetown and
Cleveland Park, by a large margin over both Councilman Jack Evans,
the only white among the major candidates, and Chavous.
</P>
<P>
   In the District, Democrats hold a 10-to-1 advantage over
Republicans in enrollment, and the black vote is an overriding
consideration in this predominantly black city.
</P>
<P>
   Citywide, final figures showed that Williams, who entered the
race only three months ago, won with 50 percent of the vote.
Chavous had 35 percent, Evans 10 percent and Councilman Harold
Brazil 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Voter turnout was very low, with just 33 percent of enrolled
Democrats participating. Williams said the low turnout was caused
by Barry's absence from the ballot. Barry, an engaging campaigner
whose speaking skills were honed in the civil rights days of the
1950s and '60s, had the effect of drawing both supporters and
opponents to the voting booth.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the low turnout, Williams said, was that
``people are disenchanted, alienated.''
</P>
<P>
   Max Berry, another powerful force in Democratic politics, a
former Barry ally and a fund-raiser for Williams, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turnout was low all over the country,'' Berry said. ``There is
a growing apathy, helped along this year by the White House
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the coming Williams campaign, Berry said: ``He will do very
well in white neighborhoods. He will do very well _ he did very
well _ in black neighborhoods, on the basis of his record, not his
rhetoric. He is not a charismatic person.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry understated Williams' low reservoir of charisma. Williams
speaks in a voice with little modulation, and his notion of a
fashion statement is a bow tie and conservative suits, quite a
change from the revivalist speeches from the dashiki-wearing Marion
Barry.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference Wednesday, a sweltering mid-September day
in Washington, Williams dressed down with khaki shorts, red T-shirt
and navy blue baseball cap, but his bow tie is bound to return.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who has worked mostly behind the scenes as a career
bureaucrat at many government agencies, is as understated as Barry
is flamboyant.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an efficiency expert,'' Berry said. ``It won't be his
bow tie and good looks.''

2 WOMEN IN HIGH-PROFILE SENATE RACE IN WASHINGTON STATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: also moved in `a' category) 
(bl) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPOKANE, Wash. _ For just the third time in the nation's
history, two women will square off against each other as major
party nominees for the U.S. Senate, after a primary here in which
Rep. Linda Smith, a conservative Republican, earned the right to
challenge Sen. Patty Murray, the Democratic incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates served together in the Washington state
Senate, and both have artfully used their perspective as mothers as
a selling point in their political campaigns. But on a range of
issues such as abortion, free trade, the environment and President
Clinton's legal and political troubles, the two clash sharply,
setting up what is likely to be a lively and competitive race for
the state's junior U.S. Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   Under Washington's unusual ``blanket primary'' system, all
candidates were on the same ballot Tuesday. Murray, with 49 percent
overall, will be the Democratic nominee Smith, with 30 percent,
easily outdistanced the 14 percent garnered by her Republican
rival, Chris Bayley, a Seattle businessman and former prosecutor
who said he would have greater appeal to moderates and independents
than Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Under the system, any candidate of another party who gets at
least 1 percent of the total vote can also run in the general
election. A perennial candidate who listed his name as Mike the
Mover, and who ran as a sales gimmick for a Seattle-area moving and
storage company, appeared to be at that threshold Wednesday as a
candidate of the Ross Perot-backed Reform Party, and will probably
be on the ballot in November. (With some absentee ballots to be
counted, results have not yet been certified.)
</P>
<P>
   In Washington state's congressional races, another woman also
made headlines. Grethe Cammermeyer, a retired Army colonel and
decorated Vietnam veteran who is one of at least four lesbians
running for the House this year, won the Democratic nomination for
a district in the northwest part of the state. She will face Rep.
Jack Metcalf, the Republican incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   The 56-year-old Cammermeyer successfully fought ouster from the
National Guard over the issue of her homosexuality, a story later
chronicled in a made-for-television movie that starred Glenn Close.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the Murray-vs.-Smith race that will probably command
the most attention in the state. On only two other occasions have
both major parties nominated women for a Senate seat, according to
the Center for the American Woman and Politics at Rutgers
University's Eagleton Institute of Politics.
</P>
<P>
   In Maine in 1960, the Republican incumbent, Sen. Margaret Chase
Smith, defeated Lucia Cormier. In Maryland in 1986, Rep. Barbara
Mikulski, a Democrat, won an open seat by defeating Republican
nominee Linda Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   In only one governor's race, in Nebraska in 1986, have two women
run against each other, said Gilda Morales, information services
coordinator for the center. There have been at least 11 such races
for seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Murray swept to an upset victory in the so-called ``Year of the
Woman'' in 1992, running as someone who had been a stay-at-home
mother for years before entering politics and who had firsthand
understanding of the concerns of working families. She said she had
once been told she was ``just a mom in tennis shoes'' who would not
be taken seriously, but she effectively turned the label on its
head and wore it as a badge of honor during her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith, who also raised a family at home while her husband
worked as a locomotive engineer for the Burlington Northern
railroad, also roared out of semiobscurity. She led the successful
fight for a statewide initiative requiring voter approval for tax
increases; then she staged a stunning write-in campaign that got
her onto the general-election ballot in 1994 and helped her defeat
a Democratic incumbent during the Republican surge of that year.
</P>
<P>
   She is a maverick who has frequently quarreled with the
leadership of her own party, and, allied with Ross Perot, she has
been a high-profile proponent of campaign-finance reform. She
refuses to take donations from political-action committees and
instead has relied on support and contributions from corps of
middle-class conservatives whom she calls ``Linda's Army.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith is also a fierce opponent of abortion, once explaining
her vote against Medicaid funding for abortion, even in the case of
rape or incest, by saying, ``We don't kill children because their
father is a jerk.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith has already called on President Clinton to resign for
his conduct involving a White House intern, and she will surely
seek to hang the president's troubles around Murray's neck this
fall. Murray has said she is deeply disappointed by the president's
behavior, but has so far refrained from calling for his resignation
or impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a barrage of late advertising from Bayley that
questioned her credentials as a reformer, Smith easily won the
Republican spot on November's ballot, a testimony in large part to
her loyal corps of followers. While many political analysts in
Washington have questioned whether she will succeed in reaching out
to moderate voters, Smith notes that she has already won twice in
her traditionally Democratic-leaning district in southwest
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pounded on, pretty much for a month,'' a jubilant
Smith said at a victory rally late Tuesday in Seattle, referring to
Bayley's ads. ``I just reminded people of who I was.''

FOR ARTISTIC FREEDOM, IT'S NOT THE WORST OF TIMES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Three years ago, Amy Lippman and Christopher
Keyser joined the legions of writers exploring once taboo subjects
when they wrote a script for the Fox drama ``Party of Five,'' in
which Julia, a principal character, got pregnant from her first
sexual encounter and had an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   But, in a sign of the times, Ms. Lippman and Keyser, the
executive producers of the highly regarded television show for
young people, were persuaded that the story was too racy and
rewrote it so that Julia (Neve Campbell) had a miscarriage before
going in for the abortion.
</P>
<P>
   What was striking about their decision was that it came not in
response to protests from anti-abortion groups but to the fears of
Fox executives, Keyser and Ms. Lippman said. The executives, they
said, were afraid that any attacks might harm the series, which was
then struggling, and the writers agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Today the show is a hit, and the story has taken another telling
turn. In an episode of ``Party of Five'' written for this fall,
Bailey (Scott Wolf), another lead character, helps a pregnant
friend get an abortion, only to be told by his girlfriend that
should she ever become pregnant she would have the child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we're exploring the subject honestly now, without
any constraints,'' said Ms. Lippman.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the questions of how honest or constrained the arts and
entertainment are in these politically charged times are
exceptionally difficult to answer. Pressure groups engaged in what
are often called the culture wars have never been more visible,
commercial concerns have never been more pressing, and, without a
doubt, the arts have never been more probing or explicit.
</P>
<P>
   The wavering ``Party of Five'' experience elucidates as well as
any the complex, tortured arc of creative freedom that currently
exists.
</P>
<P>
   A look at many examples in several different media shows that
creative license is guided by a highly variable matrix of ethical,
aesthetic and, especially, commercial influences that have produced
a sort of dialectic of freedom: a couple of steps away from the old
constraints, a couple of steps backward, then a strong step forward
again _ or toward depravity, depending on one's outlook.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, nearly every barrier has come down or come under
assault. There is little in the way of statistics to measure
censorship or self-censorship, but people who track these issues
say that the number of attacks against the entertainment media on
moral or other grounds is not rising and may even be declining.
</P>
<P>
   The American Library Association, which compiles annual figures
based on reports from its members, said the number of challenges to
library books had dropped in recent years. There were 514 such
attacks reported in 1991; the figure rose to a peak of 760 in 1994,
and then declined to 595 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Bo Anderson, general counsel for the Video Software Dealers
Association, a trade group for the video industry, said that there
had been no increase in the number of cases in which the police
have prosecuted video stores or individuals for possessing
objectionable material.
</P>
<P>
   Hilary Rosen, president of the Recording Industry Association of
America, said that she had found a general drop in the number of
instances in which pressure groups sought to have an album
suppressed, particularly since the industry began a voluntary
system in which distributors place stickers on albums with lyrics
that some might find offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liken this to a low-level virus,'' said Ms. Rosen, referring
to the pressure groups. ``It's always in your body, and sometimes
it flares up. There have been maybe four instances this year, and
15 last year and 20 the year before that. I'm one of those who
believes that freedom of expression is alive and well.''
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Cowan, dean of the Annenberg School of Communications
at the University of Southern California and author of ``See No
Evil: The Backstage Battle Over Sex and Violence on Television,''
said he agreed, particularly when the long history of censorship
was taken into account.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not, in my opinion, the worst of times,'' Cowan
stressed. ``I'd really avoid any of the apocalyptic conclusions you
sometimes hear.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say, though, that there are not pockets of
restraint, particularly for executives who have been chastened by
controversies in the past and may need to put the bottom line ahead
of First Amendment principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``More so than five or 15 years ago, you have to be much more
careful,'' said Joe Roth, chairman of Walt Disney Studios.
```Priest' was the bellwether.'' He was referring to a movie,
distributed by a Disney division in 1995, in which two Roman
Catholic priests, one straight and one gay, had sexual
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for sure there's a greater chill in the air,'' said
Richard Koshalek, director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los
Angeles, which had to contend with protests against an installation
last year by the artist Robert Gober in which a statue of the
Virgin Mary had a large piece of pipe running through her abdomen.
Yet Koshalek and many others acknowledged that these must be placed
in historical context.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many big differences now,'' said Arthur Miller,
among whose plays is ``The Crucible,'' the 1953 parable about the
McCarthy-era witch hunts. ``One difference from the '50s is there's
no generalized organization commanding a black list or something.
It's a mixed bag.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really no comparison to now in terms of the pressure
that existed back then and the kinds of things that get done
today,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best examples of how freedom and restraint coexist is
the voluntary movie ratings system administered by the Motion
Picture Association of America. The code, which will have its 30th
anniversary on Nov. 1, has had a major impact in two ways.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, the ratings system helped eliminate what
was in the 1960s a paralyzing array of local ratings and censorship
boards around the country. Jack Valenti, the association's
chairman, said there were more than 44 local censorship bodies in
the 1960s, bitterly fighting movies like ``Blowup,'' which had some
nudity, and ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' which offended
people with words that would now be considered mild vulgarities.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The ratings code has thus fostered what Valenti said was an
environment of almost total freedom, but there is this caveat:
Films that go beyond an R rating and receive the dreaded NC-17
label (no one under 17 admitted) lose virtually any chance at wide
commercial success. That is why some filmmakers regard the system
as a form of self-censorship, even if it is one that brought down a
previous, more heavy-handed censorship system.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, such forms of self-censorship, in which money exerts the
greatest influence, define the creative environment today, many
people contend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sense of self-censorship is certainly at play, given what
happens in the marketplace,'' said Tony Jonas, president of Warner
Bros. Television, which produces more television series than any
other studio. ``This little self-censorship chip is in all of our
brains now. You can shorthand a conversation because you know what
the code is.''
</P>
<P>
   The writer Larry Gelbart (``M-A-S-H,'' ``Tootsie,'' ``A Funny
Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum'') used the same term. ``The
chip is so embedded in you, you make the leap before you tell
anyone about the idea,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cowan of the Annenberg School stresses, however, that
traditionally self-censorship has been far worse than it is now,
particularly in the black-list days and when television enforced an
informal policy of racial segregation.
</P>
<P>
   More worrisome, he said, is the relatively new influence of
media conglomerates on entertainment content. ``The greater concern
is the concentration of media ownership, which involves a built-in
bias,'' said Cowan.
</P>
<P>
   With a small number of companies and entrepreneurs controlling
media empires of unprecedented size _ like Walt Disney Co., Time
Warner, Viacom and News Corp. _ there is less diversity of opinion,
Cowan said, a greater tendency for one viewpoint to be reflected
through all of the outlets of these companies and a need to satisfy
the markets by generating profits, not just striking blows for
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Gelbart said that the concentration of ownership had given a new
rationale to some of today's self-censorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not Hollywood that's pushing this, it's Wall Street,''
Gelbart said. ``It's white-collar America. It's GE. It's Disney.
It's News Corp. and their stock prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial concerns are a factor in many different forms of
entertainment. Going too far in terms of sexual content, political
messages or violence can limit a project's financial prospects, and
that may be the new taboo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much pressure groups; it's Wal-Mart and Kmart,''
said Ms. Rosen of the recording industry association, referring to
those two retailers refusing to sell albums that carry a warning
sticker.
</P>
<P>
   These pressures can work both ways. The demands of the
marketplace mean companies and artists are also compelled to try
things that are different and risque as a way of standing out from
the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure we get is making the show racier, not less
racy,'' said Christopher Lloyd, the executive producer and head
writer of ``Frasier,'' the critically acclaimed NBC sitcom.
``There's a huge amount of impetus to make things edgy, to try to
do something that hasn't been done before, not to avoid sensitive
subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonas of Warner Bros. Television also emphasized the importance
of competition as a force for greater license. ``Ten years ago,
incest, spousal abuse, drugs, for instance, you couldn't do them,''
he said. ``They're not taboo anymore. The reason for this is that
the key to television is what's not on television. We have to try
new things to be competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Gelbart said the marketplace encouraged a different kind of
openness, not the kind some writers fought fo in the past. ``It
used to be that you stripped yourself of censorship to be honest,''
he said. ``Now it's not done in the service of honesty, but in the
service of competition, of the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   What neither side denies is that on balance, movies, television
shows, books, plays and the arts routinely delve into areas that
would have been unthinkable two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in an environment of unusual license,'' said William
Donohue, president of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil
Rights, a frequent critic of some of these more open plays and
shows. ``I think things are absolutely getting worse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The old adage that if you don't like it, you can turn the
channel, is nonsense,'' said Donohue. ``You turn the channel,
figuratively or literally, and you get worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Chad Finan, president of the American Booksellers Foundation for
Free Expression, said the anxiety among such conservative groups
was justified.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question at all that there's been a general
increase in pressure from these groups in recent years,'' he said.
``But we should not blind ourselves to the fact that the media are
more explicit than they've ever been and the media have
proliferated and that there are many more types of media. `South
Park' would never have been on the air when we were kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressure groups may simply be overwhelmed by the new
permissiveness. ``They're trying to stop large historical forces
with little earthen dams,'' Finan said.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor spurring greater freedom in the realm of fiction
is nonfiction. Real life, as portrayed on television, has grown so
graphic that the people who write teleplays and screenplays have
been forced into greater luridness just to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year several Los Angeles television stations
interrupted children's programming to provide live coverage of a
standoff between the police and a man blocking a freeway,
apparently as a protest against health maintenance organizations.
The man eventually set himself and his dog on fire, incinerating
the animal, and then stumbled out of his truck to the edge of an
overpass, where he propped a shotgun under his chin and blew his
head off.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Of course, President Clinton's sex scandals have pushed the
barriers simply by introducing into normally sober-minded
television news programs extraordinarily graphic sex talk.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this seems to stand in contrast to the sharply focused
and at times well-publicized attacks by various pressure groups.
There was, for instance, the campaign last summer against Terrence
McNally's new play, ``Corpus Christi,'' which begins previews at
the Manhattan Theater Club in New York on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue and the Catholic League vigorously protested the play,
which follows a group of gay men who re-enact Christ's spiritual
journey. When the theater received bomb threats (which the Catholic
League condemned) it decided to cancel the production.
</P>
<P>
   The theater's administrators came under intense criticism and
finally put the production back on its calendar. It is scheduled to
open on Oct. 13. But the episode sent a chill through the artistic
world because of a feeling that the theater's reversals emboldened
the opponents of free expression, contributing to a climate of
fear.
</P>
<P>
   In another example, Randall Terry, an opponent of abortion and a
radio talk-show host, initiated a campaign against the Barnes &AMP;
Noble bookstore chain for carrying books with nude photos of
children that he maintained were child pornography. The chain has
been indicted in Alabama and Tennessee for carrying the books _
``Radiant Identities,'' by Jock Sturges, and ``The Age of
Innocence,'' by David Hamilton _ and there have been a number of
protests.
</P>
<P>
   But such instances, in which the attacks may exert some
influence, even if temporary, affect only a small number of
potentially offensive pieces of entertainment. For example, a stage
version of John Irving's novel ``The Cider House Rules,'' about a
doctor who conducts abortions in a small town in Maine, is now
playing at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles. The theater
prepared for heavy criticism, but it never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much to my surprise, I don't think there's been one single
eyebrow raised over this,'' said Gordon Davidson, the theater's
artistic director and producer. ``I had thought for sure we'd have
something. We even looked into security after the problem with
`Corpus Christi.' But there hasn't been a peep.''
</P>
<P>
   An argument could be made that in several widely debated cases
of protest, freedom of expression eventually won out.
</P>
<P>
   No major American movie studio would distribute Adrian Lyne's
film version of Vladimir Nabokov's novel ``Lolita.'' Although the
sex scenes between the adult, Humbert Humbert (Jeremy Irons), and
Lolita (Dominique Swain), an adolescent girl, are more suggestive
than explicit, the studios were concerned about the portrayal of
pedophilia. The movie was released in Europe last year but looked
as if it would never be seen widely in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But then Showtime, the cable channel, broadcast it this summer,
receiving much critical praise. Showtime said the viewer response
to the movie was overwhelmingly positive. The movie also played
briefly in a theater before it ran on television, so that it would
qualify for Oscar nominations, and it is now scheduled for a wider
theatrical release beginning Sept. 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no problems with booking the picture around the
country,'' said Samuel Goldwyn Jr., the chairman of Samuel Goldwyn
Films, the independent company that will be distributing the movie.
``There was no dramatic reaction at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Showtime also faced down opposition in producing and showing
Armistead Maupin's miniseries ``More Tales of the City.'' Maupin
spent more than a decade failing to get a version of his earlier
book, ``Tales of the City,'' about the social and sexual
revolutions in San Francisco in the 1970s, produced for television.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, PBS finally broadcast a hugely popular three-part
series (made in Britain). Subsequently, though, PBS, under attack
by conservatives, declined to produce the sequel.
</P>
<P>
   Showtime stepped in, presenting ``More Tales of the City,''
which includes, among other things, scenes of gay men in bed
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television is opening up,'' said Maupin. ``It's been glacial,
but it's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Finan of the booksellers' association described the overall
situation as a tide that is unlikely to turn. ``Most of the taboos
have been lifted,'' he said. ``The arts, entertainment, the media
are simply more accustomed to reflecting real life. I don't think
it's going to be stopped.''

PENALTY ON UNION: BRAINWASHING BLAKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Rob Blake has been kidnapped, whisked away right
out from under the Los Angeles Kings' noses by an increasingly
militant group called the NHLPA. The head of the operation is Bob
Goodenow and, clearly, he and his minions have brainwashed the
player who last year was voted the best defenseman in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   How else to explain the sight of Blake, exiting the Kings' North
Hills practice facility holding his sticks like Patty Hearst once
did a gun?
</P>
<P>
   Somebody or something sinister has scrambled Blake's
sensibilities, so much so he's walking around with his loyalties
misplaced, spreading the message that greed is good.
</P>
<P>
   He must be brainwashed because the Rob Blake we know _ the
low-key, level-headed, polite, personable, gracious, gutty guy from
Simcoe, Ont. _ never would have voluntarily sat out a single day of
training camp, not after missing 120 games over the past four years
because of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The Rob Blake we know is more like Ducks forward Teemu Selanne
than ex-Dodger Mike Piazza. Selanne, you'll remember, signed a
long-term contract extension earlier this year and professed not to
care if the amount put him under the market value down the line.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Rob Blake we know would have blushed at the
Kings' offer of $5 million a year over five years, not turned his
nose up at it and acted insulted a la Piazza. He would have
appreciated being the league's most highly compensated defenseman
right now, if not necessarily later, and wouldn't have worried one
whit where the market might carry salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The Rob Blake we know is grounded in today, having learned you
can't take tomorrow for granted. After seeing his career sputter
because of injuries, he would have viewed money as secondary to his
health and inconsequential to his happiness.
</P>
<P>
   The Rob Blake we know never would have let his position as the
vice president of the NHL Players Association supersede his loyalty
to the Kings. The Kings paid him full salary in 1995-96 when he
appeared in only six games, and stood by him in 1996-97 when
injuries cost him another 20 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Rob Blake we know once said of Kings management, ``I come
out of the training room again and tell them I'm hurt again and
they didn't give me a hard time or say anything. They were really
patient.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rob Blake we know wouldn't have forgotten how the
media-relations staff went the extra mile for him late last season,
putting together a glossy guide, filling it with glowing quotes and
sending it to East Coast writers who might have overlooked him when
voting for the Norris Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   The Rob Blake we know would have been looking for someone to
hipcheck upon seeing that the Hockey News _ the bible of the sport
_ clearly disagreed with the voters' final tally, listing him as
only the third-best defenseman behind St. Louis' Chris Pronger and
Detroit's Niklas Lidstrom.
</P>
<P>
   The Rob Blake we know wouldn't have been swayed by the pressure
exerted by his peers who've let him know they're waiting to sign
until after he sets a new salary standard. He'd have recognized
that by holding out for untold riches, he really was being a
feckless follower, not a fearless leader.
</P>
<P>
   The Rob Blake we know wouldn't have been among the more than 100
restricted free agents who remain unsigned as the first week of
training camp wraps up. Moreover, he would have been the first to
tell you a multi-million dollar home in Manhattan Beach is hard to
replicate anywhere else (but especially in Edmonton).
</P>
<P>
   The Rob Blake we know would have put the interests of the Kings
above his own ego, as befits a team captain. He would have accepted
a fine deal instead of holding out for a finer one, then leaned on
the likes of Aki Berg and Jamie Storr to do the same so that the
team could build on its first playoff appearance in five years with
a minimum of distractions.
</P>
<P>
   The Rob Blake we know never would have dared say if he isn't
signed by the season's start, he'd just as soon be traded.
</P>
<P>
   The pity is, by the time the Rob Blake we know is able to break
free from the NHLPA's clutches, he just might discover he has been
shipped to Pittsburgh for Jaromir Jagr or to Vancouver for Pavel
Bure.
</P>
<P>
   If they're smart, the Kings won't let the NHLPA hold their
season for ransom. Because the Rob Blake we know doesn't have the
dazzling skills of a Jagr or Bure to fill a new arena next year all
by himself, no matter the cost.

ANOTHER HUMPHREY PLANS POPULIST BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: also moved in `a' category) 
(JT) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ At a time when Democratic politicians typically
shrink from the populist ambitions of the Great Society era, Hubert
H. Humphrey III is campaigning for governor here on a vow that
government should flex its muscles for ordinary working people.
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey, the son and namesake of the former vice president,
easily won the nomination for governor on Tuesday in the
Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, highlighting his fight against
tobacco companies and his vow topay two years of college tuition
for Minnesotans.
</P>
<P>
   His Republican opponent, Mayor Norm Coleman of St. Paul, who
switched parties two years ago, has already declared that Humphrey
represents ``the old vision of tax-and-spend politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota, the most reliably Democratic state in the nation in
presidential elections in a generation, has a long history of
electing populists. But the state has been changing in recent
years, with sharp growth in the suburbs, especially among newcomers
who tend to have little familiarity, or fondness, for the
egalitarian-minded Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
   And while Humphrey bears the most revered name in Minnesota
politics, Coleman is a quick-on-his-feet candidate who has won high
praise for his efforts to revitalize St. Paul, which has often been
regarded as the poor cousin of Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, a New York native who was one of eight children, talked
about his humble background in ways unmistakably intended to cast
Humphrey as a son of privilege. ``I never had a silver spoon in my
life,'' Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   A third-party candidate, Jesse Ventura, a former professional
wrestler and former mayor of Brooklyn Park, a Minneapolis suburb,
is running on the Reform Party ticket. Ventura, known as ``The
Body,'' makes an unexpectedly strong showing for a third party
candidate, according to recent polls, which show him drawing about
13 percent of the vote in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual situation for a state that is 95 percent white,
Democrats control both houses of the state Legislature, and a
majority of the congressional delegation. But voters here have been
willing to elect Republicans, especially moderates like the current
governor, Arne Carlson, 65, who is a strong supporter of business,
but also a strong advocate of gay rights and abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman routed his opponent in the Republican primary, Bill
Dahn, 91 percent to 9 percent. Coleman, a radical anti-war
protester in his youth, will try to position himself as a centrist.
But he opposes abortion rights, and refused to sign a declaration
celebrating gay life in St. Paul.
</P>
<P>
   To gain the Democratic nomination, Humphrey bested a field of
well-known candidates, including Ted Mondale, a former state
senator who is the son of former Vice President Walter Mondale;
Mike Freeman, son of former Gov. Orville Freeman, and Mark Dayton,
an heir to the Dayton Hudson department store conglomerate, which
owns the Target chain.
</P>
<P>
   A fifth candidate, Doug Johnson, a state senator from rural
Tower, had campaigned as the only commoner in the race, but the one
with the most authentic Minnesota name.
</P>
<P>
   With all precincts counted, Humphrey won 37 percent of the vote,
followed by Freeman and Johnson, with 19 percent each, Dayton with
18 percent, and Mondale, a distant fifth with 7 percent, The
Associated Press reported.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Humphrey, the state's attorney general for the past 16 years,
has benefited from the public health lawsuit he brought against
tobacco companies that ended in a $6.1 billion settlement for the
state.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat has also promised to enact subsidies that would
provide paid tuition for two years of college for any Minnesotan at
any public or private college in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey, 56, who is known in the state as Skip, shares the
generally populist positions of his father, who was called the
Happy Warrior, but is not as enthusiastic or impassioned an orator
as his father was.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, 49, has said that his administration would concentrate
on fighting gangs and keeping taxes low. He has taken credit for
bringing a National Hockey League franchise to St. Paul, a team
that will be called the Minnesota Wild.

ECONOMIC SCENE: FED CAN INSULATE U.S. FROM MUCH OF GLOBAL CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (smw) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ First Asia. Then Russia. Now Latin America. There are
days when it seems that the United States might soon be the only
economy standing upright.
</P>
<P>
   When financial crisis struck Asia 14 months ago, it seemed a
long way away and, besides, the U.S. economy was roaring along.
When Russia fell into a financial abyss recently, the United States
did not see much of a threat from the collapse of such a tiny
economy. But now Brazil, the ninth-largest economy in the world, is
reeling. Argentina, Venezuela and Mexico may be close behind.
</P>
<P>
   Chaos south of the border is scary. Alan Greenspan, the chairman
of the Federal Reserve Board, thinks so, and he is hardly known for
hysterics. He recently observed that with a quarter of the world's
population hit by recession, ``it's just not credible that the
United States can remain an oasis of prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But there are two reasons to believe that Greenspan is
exaggerating the threat. Latin America's predicament is not as
grave as Asia's. An even better reason to think Greenspan might be
wrong is Greenspan himself. As head of the Fed, he can insulate the
economy from all but the most extreme collapse of foreign
economies.
</P>
<P>
   The news from Latin America has been bleak. Stock markets in the
region have fallen more than 40 percent this year, and Colombia and
Ecuador have devalued their currencies this month. The core of the
problem, as in Asia, is pessimism by investors whose initial
jitters grow into outright panic.
</P>
<P>
   Once investors begin to question whether Brazil or Argentina
will run out of dollar reserves or devalue, they flee _ cashing in
their investments before someone else beats them to the dwindling
reserves or before devaluation slices the dollar value of their
assets. Capital flight feeds on itself as shrinking reserves
reinforce the notion that the original jitters were warranted.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil could indeed become the next international disaster. Its
fiscal deficit exceeds 7 percent of total output, and its high
exchange rate has driven its exports, as a portion of total
economic output, lower than nearly anywhere else in the world. The
excesses leave Brazil vulnerable to capital flight. To prop up its
currency, Brazil has spent tens of billions of dollars in recent
months and has raised interest rates above 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes contagion. Argentina sells 30 percent of its exports
to Brazil. If Brazil devalues its currency, as expected,
Argentina's exports could become prohibitively expensive in Brazil.
That would leave Argentina with fewer dollars, perhaps inciting
investors to bolt.
</P>
<P>
   Though Latin America is teetering, there is good reason to
predict that it will not topple like Asia. Capital flight and
currency depreciation bankrupted many Asian companies because they
had borrowed heavily abroad. A company that sells its product for
won but borrows in dollars is pummeled when the won drops in value.
As professor Peter Kenen of Princeton University points out,
companies in Latin America have borrowed less foreign money than
their Asian counterparts and should be better positioned to survive
currency devaluations.
</P>
<P>
   There is a raging debate under way about the best way for the
United States and its allies to help Latin America snuff out
financial chaos before it festers. But however bad the impending
crisis turns out to be, it will almost certainly be a manageable
problem for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, the United States exports about $900 billion in goods
and services, or about 12 percent of total economic output. Of
that, about 20 percent goes to Central and South America. Suppose
those exports fell by 15 percent or so. That would amount to less
than a 1 percent cut in total spending in the United States _
hardly noticeable. Indeed, even if worldwide financial crises cut
exports by 15 percent across the board, the blow to the economy
would amount to less than 2 percent of total spending.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fed is not, in the memorable words of Oliver North's
lawyer before a congressional panel, a potted plant. It can react
if exports dry up. With low inflation and a strong dollar, nothing
stops the Fed from increasing the money supply.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's problem gets trickier if foreign investors dump stocks
on Wall Street and if U.S. investments abroad sour. Fill in any
reasonable number, Kenen concludes, and the Fed can cushion the
effect on jobs and living standards. As long as countries do not
let their banking systems collapse, the Fed can protect domestic
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the Fed cannot know how big a problem Latin America
could create for the domestic economy. Nor does it know how to
counteract the blow with precision. After all, setting monetary
policy today requires looking 18 months or so into the future.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the Fed cannot stabilize the economy perfectly,
most experts believe that that Fed can almost surely prevent the
domestic economy from foundering _ something that happened in the
1930s because of persistent mismanagement by the Fed policy. It
knows better today.

A SPOT FOR FERRARO?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With so many talented prospects attending this
year's training camp, perhaps it should be given a title such as
``The Kids Who Would Be Kings.''
</P>
<P>
   This is, after all, the year the Kings are hoping their recent
drafts will bear some fruit, and numerous 19-, 20- and 21-year-olds
are battling to prove themselves. So is center Ray Ferraro, who at
34 is no kid. Coming off an injury-plagued season and postseason
knee surgery, Ferraro is trying to use his savvy and experience to
win a spot after a season in which he appeared in only 40 games,
collecting 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro began the summer recovering from postseason surgery to
repair his left knee, which caused him problems for the entire
1997-98 season. He spent much of the rest of the summer working on
conditioning as he enters the final year of a contract that will
pay him $1.75 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember my first camp,'' said Ferraro, who has scored 40 or
more goals twice in his 14-year career. ``A couple of guys came
into camp 20 pounds overweight and had a month to work it off. If
you come in 20 pounds overweight now, you're probably on the next
plane out.''
</P>
<P>
   Tough camp: A week ago at this time, rookie center Eric Belanger
was preparing to travel to training camp, with realistic hopes of
making the Kings' roster. Fate, it appears, was not on his side.
</P>
<P>
   The first bad omen was travel difficulties from Canada that
delayed his arrival in Los Angeles. Then on the first day of
practice Sunday, Belanger suffered a broken nose from a high stick.
Finally, on Tuesday, the 20-year-old native of Sherbrooke, Quebec,
broke his left hand in a collision with a teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad luck,'' Belanger said Wednesday, wearing a cast on
the injured hand. ``I don't know what you call it. It's not my
camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Belanger is expected to be sidelined up to six weeks. When he is
healthy, he probably will be assigned to the IHL's Long Beach Ice
Dogs or to the Kings' American Hockey League affiliate in
Springfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good idea of what he's capable of doing and how he
plays,'' coach Larry Robinson said. ``It's just unfortunate he
can't get in any exhibition games unless a miracle happens. It's
going to be very difficult for the guy to miss four to six weeks
and expect to be right in there. For a young kid, it's going to
take him time to get in the swing of things.''
</P>
<P>
   A plus for Belanger, Robinson said, is that he has the defensive
skills to play on a third or fourth line even if he can't crack the
Kings' lineup on one of the top two lines, which are geared for
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: The star of Wednesday's scrimmage was rookie
right wing Pavel Rosa, who had a hat trick, a definite morale
booster after missing almost all of last season because of a
preseason concussion. Rosa is wearing a helmet designed by former
NHL star Pat LaFontaine, who retired this summer because of ongoing
concussion problems. He also is wearing a mouthpiece for the first
time in his career.... Unsigned defenseman Aki Berg flew to Finland
on Wednesday from Ottawa. The restricted free agent has said he is
considering signing with a team in his native land. The other
unsigned Kings _ defenseman Rob Blake, winger Matt Johnson and
goalie Jamie Storr _ have been skating at Iceoplex before Kings
practices, as has former King Marty McSorley, an unrestricted free
agent. They are expected to move next week to Glacial Garden in
Lakewood, and may be joined by several of the other 100 or so
unsigned NHL players.

IN TWIST OF FATE, EMMITT SMITH MUST CARRY THE LOAD AGAIN FOR
COWBOYS

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys running back Emmitt Smith retired to the
players lounge at the Cowboys' Valley Ranch headquarters after
practice yesterday and began ``slapping bones'' with first-year
linebacker Robert Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Like most any day of his eight-year career, Smith took up a
post-practice game of dominoes, long one of his favorite pastimes.
And despite all the off-season talk about the Cowboys' trying to
take the load off him, about his not being able to carry the load
of the offense, this is like most any day of Smith's eight-year
career.
</P>
<P>
   With Troy Aikman out at least four games recovering from a
fractured collarbone and Jason Garrett making just his third career
start at quarterback, Smith is set to carry the load again. And for
Smith, it's only natural for him to want to step up his game to
make things easier for Garrett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be human if I don't think I have to do more,''
Smith said. ``But you got to be smart about it, 'cause trying to do
too much can cost you the game.''
</P>
<P>
   If the first two games are evidence, Smith still seems capable
of carrying the load for the Cowboys. He ranks sixth in the league
in rushing with 217 yards, and his 49 carries are third-most behind
the Indianapolis Colts' Marshall Faulk (53) and the Jacksonville
Jaguars' James Stewart (52).
</P>
<P>
   He rushed 29 times for 124 yards in the 38-10 season-opening
victory against the Arizona Cardinals. And he proved to be one of
the few bright spots in Sunday's 43-24 setback to the Denver
Broncos with 93 yards on 20 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Broncos defensive tackle Trevor Pryce isn't buying the talk that
Smith, whose 1,074 rushing yards last season was his lowest output
since 1990, is on the downside of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a man that quick in my life,'' Pryce said
after the game Sunday. ``One minute you see him, the next second
he's gone. Don't believe that stuff they say about the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Cowboys coach Chan Gailey's contention that the Cowboys'
offense won't change under Garrett, Giants coach Jim Fassel
believes that the Cowboys will rely heavily on Smith and the
running game to help ease the pressure on Garrett.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel, who attributed Smith's down year in 1997 to the
deterioration of the Cowboys' offensive line, agreed with Pryce,
saying Smith looks as good as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked pretty good against Denver,'' Fassel said. ``This
guy can play. His ability is still there. He scares me when I watch
him.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Cowboys expect the Giants to employ several
eight-man fronts to stop Smith and force Garrett to throw the ball.
However, Gailey said the tactic won't dictate the Cowboys' goal of
establishing a strong running game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your goal to run, you can run against eight-man fronts,''
Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows that as much as Smith, the NFL's ninth all-time
leading rusher with 11,451 yards. He said he has faced eight-man
fronts his entire career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny how things work out,'' said Smith, raising up from
his domino game with a sly grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what's new? It's been like this for at least eight years.
The running game is going to play a major part. It always has and
it always will.''

ADVERTISING: `MILK MUSTACHE' CAMPAIGN TO BE USED TO PROMOTE
READING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Mich., Calif., Minn.)  (smw) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A major publisher is teaming up with the organization
behind the ``milk mustache'' campaign for an elaborate marketing
effort to encourage children to read _ and to encourage their
mothers to buy a certain beverage that leaves an imprint on the
upper lip.
</P>
<P>
   The Hearst Magazines division of Hearst Corp. is joining forces
with the National Fluid Milk Processor Promotion Board for a series
of events under the banner of the Read to Me Children's Literacy
Program. The multimillion-dollar program, which also involves the
Avon Morrow division of Hearst and First Book, a national nonprofit
organization, exemplifies what are known as cause-related marketing
campaigns, sponsored by advertisers seeking to do well by doing
good.
</P>
<P>
   The literacy program, scheduled to run through the spring, will
include magazine ads, retail and direct mail promotions and a
weeklong book drive at agencies in six big markets. Details are to
be described at a news conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The program stems from the long-running print campaign, now
carrying the theme ``Got milk?'' and financed by the milk promotion
board through its Milk Processor Education Program. Those familiar
ads, appearing primarily in magazines, are created by Bozell
Worldwide in New York. In them singers, athletes, actors and models
sport mock milk mustaches; the cast of the NBC sitcom ``Frasier''
will join their ranks next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the onset of the campaign, we realized we could use
magazines not only as partners in advertising but in creating ideas
that make a difference for the people we're trying to reach,'' said
Kurt Graetzer, executive director for the processor program in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hearst does a fabulous job in reaching women, mothers with
young kids,'' he added, ``and only recently, we conducted a large
research study that identified how important moms are to the
consumption of milk.''
</P>
<P>
   The literacy program is emblematic of the increasingly ambitious
``value added'' projects in which media try to differentiate
themselves from competitors and offer additional enticements to
marketers beyond ad space or commercial time.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to produce ``integrated marketing programs, big and
meaningful and multifaceted, that work on many levels,'' said
Michael Clinton, senior vice president and chief marketing officer
at Hearst Magazines in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``One objective of milk is to nourish the body,'' he added,
``and reading nourishes the mind. And Hearst is basically in the
business of selling words and reading, and all that starts with
youth.''
</P>
<P>
   The literacy program grew from discussions that began seven
months ago between Clinton and executives at Bozell, a unit of True
North Communications, who have planned 20 integrated marketing
projects for the milk promotion board to run through the end of
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `milk mustache' campaign has amazing levels of awareness
among consumers,'' said Peter Gardiner, senior partner and media
director at Bozell, ``but now we're trying to leverage that to
drive sales and usage of milk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But beyond the desire to move more milk,'' he added, ``there's
a wonderful association here: The people we want to drink more milk
are the people we want to read.''
</P>
<P>
   The literacy program is to start on Monday with the book drive
at agencies in Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, New York
and San Francisco. ``We hope to collect more than 10,000 children's
books,'' Clinton said, ``which will be cataloged by First Book and
donated to inner-city schools.'' Participants include Bozell;
independent agencies like Citron Haligman Bedecarre and Kirshenbaum
Bond &AMP; Partners, and offices of agencies owned by Cordiant
Communications Group PLC, Interpublic Group of Cos., Omnicom Group,
Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC, WPP Group PLC and Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, Hearst and First Book will make a direct-mail
appeal to members of such organizations as the American Literacy
Association, the Coalition for America's Children and the Junior
League. The offer: Buy two gallons of milk and receive a free
children's book published by Avon Morrow.
</P>
<P>
   Similar offers will be made next year at 7,500 grocery stores
nationwide and in ads in four Hearst magazines: Cosmopolitan,
Country Living, Good Housekeeping and Redbook. (Ads from the
mustache campaign are running in those magazines through June along
with three other Hearst titles: Esquire, Harper's Bazaar and Marie
Claire.)
</P>
<P>
   The literacy program will serve as ``the kickoff for a major
initiative for Hearst Magazines,'' Clinton said, under the theme of
``We read America.'' That will include a corporate ad campaign, he
added, by Margeotes/Fertitta &AMP; Partners in New York, majority-owned
by MDC Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst Magazines has other caused-related campaigns scheduled
for the fall, Clinton said, including one with the American Academy
of Family Physicians and Walgreen Co.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, additional celebrities are being recruited for the
mustache campaign. The ``Frasier'' cast ads will promote the
broadcast of the 1998-99 season premiere episode at 9 p.m., Eastern
and Pacific times, on Sept. 24.
</P>
<P>
   The headline of one ad slyly refers to the fact that
``Seinfeld'' previously occupied that slot on the NBC schedule:
``Our cereal-loving predecessor was kind enough to leave behind
some milk. Care to join us?''
</P>
<P>
   And the mustache ads will be the subject of a book due next
month from Ballantine Books. ``The Milk Mustache Book'' is written
by Jay Schulberg, vice chairman and chief creative officer at
Bozell.  &QL;

WEIGHT PROBLEM SIDELINING WHEATLEY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Giants coach Jim Fassel introduced a new
twist to the tangled Tyrone Wheatley saga Wednesday, indicating
that running back Wheatley didn't play last week because he was
over a designated playing weight the team has set for him.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the mercurial Wheatley, who has been injured
frequently, who infuriated the former New York Giants coach, Dan
Reeves, and whose drowsiness at meetings once led the team to test
him for a sleep disorder, won't crack the Giants' lineup until his
weight drops to under 235 pounds, according to a team official.
</P>
<P>
   Wheatley and Fassel both implied they thought Wheatley would
make the weight and play Monday night against the Dallas Cowboys,
although the team would like the 6-foot Wheatley to ultimately
weigh nearer to 230 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Wheatley, who hasn't been in uniform for either of
the Giants' first two games, said he ``was a couple pounds away''
from the team's goal for him.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he expected to make the weight standard by Saturday,
when the team would traditionally weigh some players, Wheatley
said, ``I hope so.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel's explanation of his approach and attitude toward
Wheatley Wednesday was another chapter in their remarkably unusual
relationship. Said Fassel of Wheatley, ``If you want to call it
tough love, then call it tough love.''
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Fassel told Wheatley that he wanted him to report
to the team's training camp at or below 230 pounds. During camp,
Wheatley asked that the weight limit be raised, a request that
Fassel granted. But a team official said Wednesday that Wheatley
had not met the new weight.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a spate of injuries just before the team's season
opener, Wheatley might have been made inactive for the team's first
game even if he had been below the weight limit. But in the days
before the team's game with Oakland last week, several Giants were
told that Wheatley was going to dress and play.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the game, he was made inactive _ because he had
not lost enough weight, according to a team official.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a bad bone in my body for that young man,''
Fassel said Wednesday of Wheatley, who was the team's first-round
draft pick out of Michigan in 1995. ``I want him to play. We need
him to play. We only need him to play if he's going to be
functionally ready for us and I can count on him. On some things, I
am nonyielding.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants are expected to turn to Wheatley for help in reviving
a dormant running attack against Dallas. Tiki Barber remains the
team's starting running back, but Fassel said Wheatley has already
been included in the regular rotation of backs practicing with the
first string offense. Fassel on Wednesday handicapped Wheatley's
chances of playing Monday as ``decent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows specifically what he needs to do to dress and to play
in the game on Monday night,'' Fassel said.
</P>
<P>
   If Wheatley makes the weight guideline, it is likely he will
replace Gary Brown, who has just 21 yards on 10 carries, as
Barber's backup _ a backup who gets a chance to win the starting
job.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving Giants Stadium late Wednesday afternoon _ after an extra
workout on one of the team's treadmills _ Wheatley seemed
unperturbed by the latest off-the-field episode to mark his career.
Earlier in the day, he had met privately with Fassel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about some things, and he stated what he stated,''
Wheatley said. ``I'm sure he's a man of his word. I've got to do
what I've got to do. All this other stuff, it does no good for the
Giants and it does no good for me to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Giants linebacker Jessie Armstead said he was looking forward to
Wheatley's presence on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to see him come back and look like he did at
Michigan,'' Armstead said. ``There was nobody better than him then.
He's still got it in him.''

SO-SO SOLHEIM CUP IS NO HIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ I can't work myself into a patriotic frenzy over
the Solheim Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the event features a Ryder Cup format and 23 of the 25
best women golfers on the planet. It's one of those America vs.
Europe tussles with the home team decked out in the obligatory red,
white and blue. The rhetoric might even match the attire.
</P>
<P>
   But wrapping the fifth edition of this cup in Old Glory doesn't
make it anything more than an intramural match, which explains why
one of the biggest events in women's golf is a tournament that
hasn't struck a chord with the general golfing public.
</P>
<P>
   Marie-Laure de Lorenzi of France is the only member of the
European team who plays full-time on that continent's anemic
women's tour. Her teammates, six of them Swedes, all make a nice
living tearing up courses visited by the Ladies Professional Golf
Association, which is as American as Foot-Joy and Titleist.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams spend most of their season on U.S. soil playing each
other. The reality is it's the U.S. against Lorenzi, a one-woman
road show.
</P>
<P>
   And how can the Solheim Cup be a really big golfing deal when
the player responsible for most of the attention focused on this
tour, Se Ri Pak, isn't playing since she was born on the wrong
continent?
</P>
<P>
   Another of the world's best players, Karrie Webb from Australia,
isn't coming over to compete.
</P>
<P>
   It is an irony not lost on U.S. captain Judy Rankin and some
members of her squad, who start play Friday at Muirfield Village
Golf Club in Dublin, Ohio, a Jack Nicklaus-designed venue that is
building a rich tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about expanding the cup's horizon is already starting to
surface, especially since it would mean getting marquee names like
Pak and Webb in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been asked that question a lot this year,'' acknowledged
Meg Mallon of the U.S. squad. ``You know, my question back to you
is: Why does the USA always have to play the world in the first
place?''
</P>
<P>
   Mallon would not mind seeing Canadian, Central or South American
players added to something we could really call the Americas Team.
</P>
<P>
   Rankin, though, thinks a format change might be inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is the possibility of this being altered some
way. I know some of the original organizers ... sometimes waiver
now and wish they had done it a little bit differently,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rankin also acknowledges that the European players are
dead set against a change. One of them is Sweden's Helen
Alfredsson, a member at Glendale's Oakmont Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a shame that some of the best players don't
belong to any team, but I think this event should stay the way it
is,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rankin, though, believes the European women's tour must get
stronger for the cup to survive in its current format.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that tour continues to struggle and can't put together
enough tournaments to have a viable European LPGA, then these
questions will be taken more seriously,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that will be taken seriously this weekend is the golf.
Europe is fielding one of its strongest teams ever and in some
quarters that team is seen as the favorite. Clearly, the Americans
don't like being considered the underdogs on their home soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can consider us whatever they want. I thought we were the
underdog the last time and we hold the Cup,'' Rankin said. ``If you
just want my opinion, I think these two teams are very evenly
matched. I think these matches will be something to see. I cannot
see us as an underdog.''
</P>
<P>
   And the U.S. team has vowed to retain the Cup it won 17-11 in a
1996 thrashing in Wales.
</P>
<P>
   NowRankin can only hope that the old nemesis, deja vu, doesn't
jump up from Muirfield's rough and mug her team. There is
historical precedent for this. Eleven years ago the European Ryder
Cup team paid a visit to Dublin, Ohio, and for the first won the
Ryder Cup on U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
   That event hasn't been the same since.

UNEQUAL TREATMENT IS RAISED IN HOMER DERBY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The suggestion has not reached the proportions of a national
debate, but talk about it has become part of the home run race that
has commanded the United States' attention: Major-league baseball
has slighted Sammy Sosa in its treatment of him and Mark McGwire,
and race is the reason.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball officials and Sosa's agent flatly rejected both notions
Wednesday. ``Sammy doesn't perceive it that way and neither do
we,'' Tom Reich, the agent, said, speaking for himself and his
partner, Adam Katz. ``The attention that has been given to Sammy
has been tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was singled out the night he hit his 62nd home run,
baseball officials said, because that was the home run that broke
Roger Maris' record, and they had centered the initial stage of
their involvement on that achievement. Had Sosa hit his 62nd before
McGwire, the officials said, Commissioner Bud Selig would have
given him the award he gave McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a huge media crush and we had to set something up
for that,'' Selig said. ``McGwire broke Maris' record. Sammy has
tied the new record.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig gave McGwire the first Commissioner's Historic Achievement
Award after the game in St. Louis Sept. 8, and he said he would
give the same award to Sosa, a native of the Dominican Republic, on
Sunday in Chicago as part of the Cubs' ceremony honoring their
right fielder. Both players, Selig added, will be honored during
the World Series, no matter who wins the race.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire had 63 home runs and Sosa 62 entering Wednesday night's
games. Sosa has led McGwire only once, for two and two-thirds
innings during the game between their teams on Aug. 18. Selig said
he had received some calls from fans who said they thought Sosa had
been slighted. But, he said by telephone from Milwaukee, ``I
explained it to them and they were satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Charges that the two players have been treated unevenly have
come from fans and sports columnists. Rich Levin, the executive
director of baseball's public relations department, said that any
suggestion that race influenced the treatment was an insult. ``It's
absolutely preposterous,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reich, who was with Sosa in San Diego, where the Cubs played
Wednesday night, also scoffed at the charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reject that completely,'' he said in a telephone interview.
``That stuff is not at work here.''
</P>
<P>
   Reich said Sosa and his representatives felt so positive about
baseball's treatment of Sosa that Reich expressed that feeling in a
letter Wednesday to Paul Beeston, baseball's chief operating
officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obvious,'' Reich wrote, ``that much of the media has
chosen to make a significant issue out of possible unbalanced
attention to Mark McGwire at the expense of the spectacular young
Sammy. As you will see and hear, Sammy Sosa and Reich/Katz reject
this notion out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Reich went on to write that they were ``very appreciative of the
consideration and respect'' shown by ``all of the components of
major-league baseball.'' And he thanked major-league baseball ``for
the sensitivity, enthusiasm and many kindnesses that have been
extended to Sammy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Reich reiterated that Sosa ``feels he's been
treated extremely well by major-league baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   One issue critics have raised is the different balls that have
been used in McGwire and Sosa games. From the time McGwire reached
58, specially marked balls were used for his at-bats until he hit
No. 62. Once he hit that one, the marked balls were put away until
the end of the season draws closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan,'' Levin said, ``was to authenticate two balls, the
one that broke Maris' record and the one that was the last one that
would represent the home run record.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin said baseball had assigned personnel to be with Sosa and
McGwire beginning Tuesday night, and those people will remain with
the players the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Andy MacPhail, the Cubs' president, said the club had no
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're comfortable and Sammy is comfortable with what
major-league baseball has done and is going to do,'' he said.
``We're honoring Sammy Sunday at our last home game and
major-league baseball will be part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin said that except for Selig's presentation of the award the
night McGwire hit his 62nd home run, the postgame ceremony was
handled entirely by the Cardinals.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TBILISI, Georgia _ This small nation nestled under the towering
Caucasus Mountains, which has a history stretching back several
millennia but which emerged from the debris of the Soviet Union
only seven years ago, has a rich creative tradition based on the
mixture of fantasy and reality.
</P>
<P>
   In the 20th century that tradition has been expressed most
vividly in film, and today a hardy group of more than a dozen
filmmakers is struggling against severe economic constraints,
trying to preserve, extend and deepen it.
</P>
<P>
   Georgian cinema _ like, some would say, the Georgian soul itself
_ is built largely on surrealism and poetic intensity. So it is
entirely appropriate that Nana Djordjadze is one of the country's
leading filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask me why I make films, I ask you why you breathe,''
Ms. Djordjadze (pronounced jor-JAD-zeh) said recently at the
cavernous sound stage that she and three other directors bought in
1993. ``I cannot imagine my life without film.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Djordjadze has six feature films behind her, including ``A
Chef in Love,'' which was nominated for an Oscar as best foreign
film of 1996. It features a chef with a nose so sensitive that he
can instantly identify wine vintages and the ingredients of
elaborate dishes; the kidnapping of a pig; and a communist
commissar who orders the closing of the best restaurant in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ms. Djordjadze bridled at the suggestion that it is anything
other than realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no more unreal than my own life and imagination,'' she
insisted.
</P>
<P>
   That life and imagination, however, are extraordinary even by
Georgian standards.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Djordjadze was born aboard an airplane over the Caucasus,
and as a child aspired to be a pilot because to her that job
epitomized freedom. As a child in Tbilisi, the Georgian capital,
she lived above a fire station and was adopted by the fire brigade
as a sort of mascot, often dressing in a firefighter's hat and
rubber coat. She spent many afternoons walking through the old
city, not on the streets but on rooftops.
</P>
<P>
   ``My childhood was full of secrets and surprises,'' she said,
jumping up from her seat every few minutes to illustrate her
memories. ``My family was full of crazy people. When the Red Army
arrived here in 1921, my grandmother told her servants: `Close the
window. They must go away.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather came back from the gulag after 25 years. He
confused everything, and since I was the only non-grown-up in the
house, I was the only one he could communicate with. Once he
suddenly insisted that we go to visit the place where he grew up.
He pointed to a spot and we began to dig. After a few minutes we
felt some cloth, and there was a package that turned out to contain
three volumes of Byron and one of Shakespeare. He had buried them
there before he was arrested. I still have those books. They're
very important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every moment of my life is full of these romantic things. In
my family, tragic stories were always told with humor. I also have
this style. Today we have problems, but tomorrow will be much
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Djordjadze discovered movies at so-called ``cinema clubs,''
where officially banned foreign films were shown late at night with
a wink from the authorities, who were never as dogmatic as their
bosses in faraway Moscow. Transfixed by Jean Renoir, Robert
Flaherty, John Ford, Luis Bunuel, Federico Fellini and others, she
resolved to follow in their footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, at the age of 16, she traveled to Prague,
Czechoslovakia, to attend that city's Academy of Art. She was
caught up in the excitement of the ``Prague spring,'' but when
Soviet troops invaded in August of that year she was arrested and
sent home. She began experimenting with film, and in the 1980s two
of her films won prizes at the festivals in Berlin and Cannes.
</P>
<P>
   Together with her husband, Irakli Kvirikadze, who has written
the scripts for most of her films, Ms. Djordjadze is among the most
active Georgian filmmakers. Today she is involved in several
projects, the details of which she declined to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   What makes her remarkable is not simply her body of work, which
includes ``A Journey to Sopot'' (1980) and ``Robinozaida'' (1987),
later released in English as ``My English Grandfather,'' but the
fact that she and her contemporaries represent one of the world's
most interesting cinematic traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's film industry emerged soon after the first moving
pictures were shown in Paris and Berlin. Shorts were first made
here in 1908, with the first full-length documentary following in
1912 and the first full-length feature in 1916.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   During the Soviet period, Georgian films won prizes around the
world. Officials in Moscow often claimed them as examples of the
brilliance of Soviet art, but strictly limited their distribution
within the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for their ambivalence was, not surprisingly,
political. Many early Georgian films were obliquely critical of
Soviet rule. During the years of Stalinist power, filmmakers here
had no chance to make anything other than films extolling the
wonders of collective farming and industrialization. Later,
however, they adopted the indirect language of parable and metaphor
to convey iconoclastic messages.
</P>
<P>
   Some Georgian films of the 1960s and '70s won awards at Moscow
festivals, among them Sergo Parajanov's widely praised ``Shadows of
Forgotten Ancestors'' and Eldar Shengelaya's ``Samanashvili's
Stepmother'' and ``Blue Mountains.'' Others, however, were all but
completely repressed.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most memorable of these were three silent shorts by
Michael Kobakhidze, all made in the 1960s: ``Wedding,''
``Umbrella'' and ``Musicians.'' Shot in black and white, they have
no direct political content but are utterly anti-Soviet in their
lightness, sly humor and tragicomic refusal to accept the
conventions of heroism or social obligation. Now they are shown on
Georgian television.
</P>
<P>
   Kobakhidze, along with several other Georgian directors, has
emigrated and lives in Paris. He has told recent visitors that he
is working on another film, his first in many years, but will say
no more.
</P>
<P>
   One Georgian film towers above all others as a political
landmark. ``Repentance,'' directed by Tengiz Abuladze, who died in
1994, was released in 1986 as the reforms of Mikhail Gorbachev were
beginning to take hold. It is a deeply penetrating critique of
Stalinism, though on the surface it is only about a benevolent
small-town mayor who, desperate to hold onto his post, slowly
becomes cruel and repressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This film is anti-tyranny, anti-power, in other words, against
barbarism,'' Abuladze said after ``Repentance'' won the special
grand jury prize in 1987 at Cannes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Repentance'' could not have been made without the connivance
of Eduard Shevardnadze, who then headed the Georgian Communist
Party and is now the nation's president. After reading the script,
Shevardnadze told the filmmakers that Moscow would never approve it
and suggested that they write a bland script with the same title
and send it to Moscow. After it was approved, he told them, they
should go ahead and make the film as originally planned.
</P>
<P>
   The ruse worked, and by the time the film was completed, the
Soviet political climate had loosened so much that it became a huge
hit throughout the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Abuladze's influence is still being felt. Directors like Ms.
Djordjadze absorbed his techniques and philosophy of life as his
students at the Tbilisi film academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very strong cultural tradition and a devotion to the
concept of individual creativity,'' said Irina Gogoberidze, a film
historian and critic in Tbilisi. ``Neorealism, symbolism and other
forms of intellectual filmmaking are deeply rooted here. Directors
look in that direction rather than toward pleasing the masses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally, our best films have been very light and open,''
Ms. Gogoberidze said. ``Unfortunately our economic troubles, not to
mention the political difficulties, have turned some of our
filmmakers toward nihilism. But I believe that someday we will
produce a great Georgian blockbuster. We have all the
ingredients.''

 &HT;    FBI, ex-agent at odds over possible King clue
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- A former FBI agent said Wednesday he will not
willingly turn over to federal officials today documents he
retrieved from James Earl Ray's car 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Former Agent Donald Wilson said he met for two hours Thursday
near his suburban Chicago home with Barry Kowalski, who is heading
the Justice Department's newly reopened investigation into the
April 4, 1968, assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in
Memphis. But, Wilson said, he declined to turn over the documents
after discovering that a federal investigator had him under
surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a private citizen,'' Wilson said. ``I'm not a criminal.
Who authorizes the surveillance of a private citizen?''
</P>
<P>
   Later Thursday evening, Wilson said, Kowalski called to tell him
that he had obtained a search warrant from a judge in Chicago and
that federal agents would retrieve the evidence from Wilson's bank
vault today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to turn it over,'' Wilson said. ``They want to
destroy it. This is not an unbiased investigation. He says it's the
property of the U.S. government. I dispute that.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson in March said he had retrieved two scraps of paper from
Ray's abandoned white Ford Mustang when he was an FBI agent
stationed in Atlanta in April 1968. Both papers contain the word
``Raul.'' Ray, who died in April while serving a 99-year sentence,
maintained he had been set up by a smuggler he only knew as
``Raoul.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who served the FBI 10 years, said he had not turned over
the evidence earlier because he did not trust the integrity of the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Attorney General Janet Reno authorized a limited
investigation into Wilson's allegations and into claims by a former
Memphis restaurant owner that a mob boss paid him $100,000 to hire
an assassin.

ITEM IN MUSEUM'S DIAMOND EXHIBIT WAS ON SWISSAIR FLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (smw) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ At least one of the more than 200
diamond-encrusted cultural objects that were displayed at the
American Museum of Natural History in New York until the end of
last month was aboard the Swissair jet that crashed into the
Atlantic near here on Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   The museum said Wednesday that a piece from its ``Nature of
Diamonds'' exhibition was being shipped back to Europe aboard the
jet, but said that the lender had insisted that no further
information be released.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are still trying to determine what caused the
emergency about an hour after Flight 111 took off from Kennedy
International Airport in New York headed for Geneva. After the
cockpit filled with smoke, the pilots radioed an emergency but soon
lost contact with the control tower in Halifax. Both flight
recorders failed to work during the final six minutes before the
jet hit the water, killing all 229 people on board.
</P>
<P>
   The special diamond exhibition at the museum opened in November
and was originally scheduled to close on April 26. But it was so
popular, drawing more than 250,000 visitors, that it was extended
through Aug. 30. The exhibition included cultural objects like
jewelry, crowns, figurines and the Bible of Catherine the Great.
</P>
<P>
   Swissair confirmed this week that Flight 111 was carrying a
valuable cargo of diamonds, watches and jewelry, along with a large
quantity of cash and two pieces of artwork, one of them an original
painting by Picasso. Swissair officials said that the painting,
``Le Peintre,'' was probably destroyed in the crash because it was
shipped as general cargo, inside a wooden frame.
</P>
<P>
   The diamonds and other valuables were packed in a locked
aluminum case, about 4 feet high, that has not been found by Navy
divers trying to retrieve material from the crash site.
</P>
<P>
   The Swissair cargo manifest lists 2 pounds of diamonds, 4 pounds
of watches and 10 pounds of jewelry, airline officials said. The
weights given include the special packaging provided by the
shippers.
</P>
<P>
   Urs Peter Naef, a spokesman for Swissair's cargo handling unit,
said in a telephone interview from Zurich that the manifest listed
two separate packages of diamonds that were being shipped aboard
the flight. Naef said it was unlikely that the individual packages
would have included diamonds from more than one sender, although it
is normal practice for all the valuables aboard a flight to be
included in the same special cargo bay container.
</P>
<P>
   Holly Evarts, a spokeswoman for the Museum of Natural History,
said she did not know whether any other diamonds from the
exhibition had been shipped aboard that flight of Swissair, which
is regularly used by jewelers. Several companies had lent jewels or
cultural pieces for the exhibition, including Van Cleef &AMP; Arpels
and Cartier.
</P>
<P>
   Muffie Potter, a spokeswoman for Van Cleef &AMP; Arpels, said that
none of the company's pieces lent to the museum had been on the
Swissair flight.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Cartier, Gail Winston, said Wednesday that
some of the jewels it lent to the museum had come from the
company's museum in Geneva. ``But luckily,'' she said, ``they're
already back in Geneva.'' &QL;

EXCERPTS FROM CLINTON'S PRESS CONFERENCE WITH HAVEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from a transcript of
Wednesday's news conference at the State Department by President
Clinton and Czech President Vaclav Havel as recorded by The New
York Times:
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON: Today I am very proud to stand with President Vaclav
Havel of the Czech Republic. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I was proud to visit President Havel in Prague in 1994 to see
the great energy, creativity, joy of the Czech people unleashed.
When we celebrate freedom today we know that many challenges still
lie ahead. President Havel recently put it very well. ``Something
is being born,'' he said, ``one age is succeeding another. We live
in a world where everything is possible and almost nothing is
certain.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, our meetings focused on seizing those possibilities and
minimizing those uncertainties. . . . We talked about next year's
NATO summit here and the Czech Republic's preparations for
integration into the NATO alliance. . . .
</P>
<P>
   We spoke about the urgent need to bring stability to Kosovo to
prevent suffering there and the current tensions in Albania. We
discussed ways to strengthen our cooperation against the terrible
scourge of terrorism. . . . We are making progress as friends and
partners. That is possible only because of the courage President
Havel and the Czech people have shown and continue to show today.
We will continue to do the hard work together so that our children
can reap the full benefits of it in the new century. . . .
</P>
<P>
   HAVEL: The situation of contemporary world is very complicated.
We feel it especially in Europe, especially in central Europe,
especially in Czech Republic. And I think that in this situation
it's extremely important the responsibility of United States, as
the biggest, most powerful country all around the world.
</P>
<P>
   And I'm extremely grateful or thankful to Mr. President and his
leadership because it was in his time when we received the chance
to build new Europe and to build new Europe it means to build the
new world, peaceful world. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q: Mr. President, what can the U.S. and NATO do to stop the
killing in Kosovo? And what do you say to people who have said that
you have lost all the moral authority to lead this nation or to
conduct foreign affairs?
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON: Let me answer the second question first. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I have never stopped leading this country in foreign affairs in
this entire year and I never will. . . . We have taken action
against those who killed our people and killed the Kenyans and
Tanzanians. We have . . . been working for peace in Northern
Ireland, for stability in Russia. I have been personally involved
in the peace process in the Middle East again as it reaches another
critical phase. I gave a speech Monday which I think is about the
most important subject now facing the world community: How to limit
this financial crisis and keep it from spreading; how to develop
long-term institutions that will help to promote growth and
opportunity for ordinary people around the world in a way that
permits America's economic recovery to go on. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I had a good talk with President Chirac of France, who called me
a couple of days ago to talk about some of our common concerns and
the U.N. inspection system in Iraq and other things. So I feel good
about that.
</P>
<P>
   Now on Kosovo . . . we have looming there, right next door to
Bosnia, a significant humanitarian problem. There are many many
tens of thousands of people who've been dislocated from their homes
. . . at very high levels in the mountains, which means it will get
colder there much more quickly than in the rest of the country. . .
. We're doing everything we can to avert the humanitarian disaster.
. . . We're pursuing negotiated settlement options through
Ambassador Chris Hill. . . . We're doing NATO planning and
consulting with our allies because I still believe the big problem
here is Mr. Milosevic is determined to get a military solution if
he can instead of pursuing a diplomatic solution. . . . While the
political and legal situation is not identical to what we had in
Bosnia, the humanitarian issue is similar. And we don't want a
repeat of Bosnia. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you think you do have a moral authority to lead this
nation?
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON: Well, you might _ in my view, that is something that
you have to demonstrate every day. My opinion is not as important
as the opinion of others. What is important is that I do my job. .
. . I'm determined to lead this country and to focus on the issues
that are before us. It is not an option. There's no option. We have
got to deal with these things.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Mr. President, from your understanding of events, is Monica
Lewinsky's account of your relationship accurate and truthful? And
do you still maintain that you did not lie under oath in your
testimony?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON: I have said for a month now that I did something that
was wrong. On last Friday at the prayer breakfast I laid out as
carefully and as brutally honestly as I could what I believed the
essential truth to be. I also said then and I will say again that I
think that the right thing for our country and the right thing for
all people concerned is not to get mired in all of the details
here, but to focus, for me to focus on what I did, to acknowledge
it, to atone for it and then to work on my family, where I still
have a lot of work to do, difficult work. And to lead this country
to deal with the agenda before us, these huge issues that I was
talking about internationally. Plus, with only two weeks left to go
in this budget year a very, very large range of items before the
American people here at home. Doing our part to deal with this
financial crisis with the, funding the International Monetary Fund,
saving the Social Security system before we spend the surplus,
doing the important work that we can do to help educate our
children, dealing with the patients' bill of rights for these
people, 160 million of them in HMOs. These are the things to me
that I should be talking about as president without in any way ever
trying to obscure my own personal acknowledgment and chagrin about
what I did wrong and my determination to put it right.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Mr. President Havel, you said today that President Clinton is
your great friend. I wonder if the discovered misdeeds of President
Clinton have any how influenced your approach to him, your relation
to him?
</P>
<P>
   HAVEL: I didn't recognize any change . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q: Mr. President, as the Lewinsky matter continues to unfold,
can you foresee any circumstance where you might consider
resignation, either because of the personal toll on you or the toll
on the country? And do you think it's fair if the House should
release its videotapes?
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON: Let me first of all say that the personal toll on me is
of no concern except insofar as it affects my personal life. . . .
because I'm working on what I should be working on. I believe the
right thing for the country and I what I believe the people of the
country want, is now that they know what happened, they want to put
it behind them and they want to go and they want me to go on and do
my job. And that's what I intend to do. That is the right thing to
do.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of the question you asked about the House, they have to
decide that. . .
</P>
<P>
   Q: When you gave your deposition, sir, were you fully aware that
it might be released, the videotape?
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON: I think that I knew that the rules were against it, but
I thought it would happen. I think that's where I was on that. But
it's not of so much concern to me. I mean, you know that I
acknowledged an improper relationship and that I declined to
discuss the details. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q: Mr. President, you have mentioned in your speech that you
appreciate the personal contribution of President Clinton to the
NATO enlargement, and you see him also as a personal friend. I'd
like to know how do you think that an eventual resignation or
impeachment of President Clinton would influence the American
foreign policy and the Czech-American relations?
</P>
<P>
   HAVEL: (now through translator) I believe, first, that this is a
matter for the United States and for the American people, who will
be their President. When I have made a friendship with someone, I
remain that person's friend no matter which office he or she holds
or doesn't hold.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Mr. President, your initiative on race finishes this month
and your press secretary yesterday agreed that the race initiative
isn't flying because of your current problems and it was bogged
down in the muck and mire.
</P>
<P>
   But do you regret that your personal problems affected your
potential legacy on race and that it may just, at best, be a
Band-Aid approach to racism in America?
</P>
<P>
   MICHAEL McCURRY: That's not exactly what I said.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON: I don't know if he said that. But if he did, I strongly
disagree with him. I don't think it has affected it at all.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, I think, the response you've seen from some
sectors of the American community have reinforced and acknowledged
the centrality of this issue to the work of the last six years, not
just the work of the last year.
</P>
<P>
   And let me also say that what is coming to an end here is this
phase of it. And there will be a report that the board will give me
a set of recommendations. Then we expect to produce a document. . .
.

WHITMAN BACKS $1.2 BILLION CUT IN PROPERTY TAXES 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Gov. Christie Whitman embraced a host of
recommendations Wednesday that she said would eventually reduce
local property taxes by $1.2 billion, and then went on to propose
an immediate rebate of $100 million in surplus state tax revenue to
property owners.
</P>
<P>
   Saying she recognized that New Jersey residents, who pay the
highest per capita property taxes in the nation, needed tax relief
now, the governor added that the state's strong economy and the
brisk pace of revenue collection in the fiscal year ended June 30
made the rebates possible.
</P>
<P>
   She said she could not guarantee that the economy would allow
rebates in the future, but added, ``When state government takes in
more money than we expected, then it's time to remember where that
money came from and to give it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said that the specifics of the rebate program would have
to be worked out with the state Legislature and added that it was
too early to predict how much would be refunded. But she insisted
that the money would go directly to those who pay local property
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the governor said that the rebate plan complemented the
array of other measures recommended this week by a panel she set up
after last year's election to find ways of cutting property taxes.
Of the 60 recommendations by the commission, Whitman immediately
endorsed 17 proposals she said she would enact through executive
order or by supporting bills now before the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations that she embraced would create state
incentives for localities to consolidate and regionalize some
services, allow the state to pay the cost of local prosecutors and
authorize some urban areas to levy new or additional taxes on
parking, entertainment and hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Like the recommendations of the panel, the Property Tax
Commission, which were formally released on Tuesday, the governor's
proposed rebate program met with mixed reaction from Democrats and
Republicans. Some praised her for trying to direct tax relief to
property owners but questioned the timing of it when the state
needs to spend money to improve transportation and schools.
</P>
<P>
   Others charged that the rebate program was an attempt to make up
for the tepid, or as one said, ``the less than ambitious''
recommendations of her tax commission. In particular, they
criticized the commission for not calling for any major shifts in
education costs. Such expenses are by far the largest segment of
local tax bills, and critics have said for years that the state
should assume more of these costs.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Joseph Doria, the Democratic minority leader, termed
the $100 million in immediate rebates ``Son of Property Tax Relief
Fund,'' and said neither the rebates nor the longer-term proposals
of the governor's commission would quiet the public furor over
residents' heavy local tax burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the recommendations are giving the distinct impression
that this governor is seeking to use bravura instead of substance
to extinguish the public firestorm over high property taxes,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating such criticism, Whitman adopted the cautious tone
of the commission members, who said Wednesday that any wholesale
shifting of education costs from local property taxes would mean a
loss of some local control _ consequences that required a more
complete public discussion.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's rebate program is similar to those of a
half-dozen states around the nation that, finding themselves flush
in good economic times, have sought ways to ease tax burdens
immediately without permanently lowering tax rates or altering tax
codes.
</P>
<P>
   It is a new experience for many states, which have been
experiencing ``sustained surpluses'' for up to four years running,
said Mandy Rafool, a policy specialist with the National Conference
of State Legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey by the group, Connecticut, Colorado,
Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio and Oregon have given such rebates. Only
Colorado and Missouri are required by statute or their
constitutions to do so whenever there are surpluses, Ms. Rafool
said. The rebates ranged from $37 to $260 for homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's plan calls for the first rebates to come from fiscal
1998 revenue. In the future, rebates would be made to property
owners if state income tax revenue exceeded the governor's
projections by 10 percent and all other state taxes met their
projected levels. Twenty percent of the overflow would go into the
rebate fund in any given year and it would be disbursed to property
taxpayers only when it reached $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   State Treasurer James DiEleuterio said that last year state
income tax receipts were $4.85 billion, or $554 million more than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   This amount is above the 10 percent threshold that would cause a
rebate and 20 percent of it produces the approximately $100 million
that Whitman proposes to disburse as rebates once the Legislature
arrives at a mechanism for allotting it to property owners.
</P>
<P>
   As for the commission recommendations, Whitman said she would
create a $25 million state fund to provide the financial incentives
for municipalities that consolidated services in the interest of
efficiency. &QL;

AS GREAT AS BACH? WELL, AT LEAST HE'S GETTING A HEARING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the French composer Jean Barraque died in 1973, at 45, he
left behind a tiny body of work and an enormous reputation.
According to the version of 20th-century musical history put
forward by Andre Hodeir in his book ``Since Debussy,'' in 1961,
Barraque, though he had written just four works at the time,
delivered the promises that had been only partly fulfilled by
Schoenberg, Stravinsky, Messiaen and Pierre Boulez.
</P>
<P>
   This accolade brought him attention, and a paragraph in Time
magazine, but it probably caused him little embarrassment, because
it coincided pretty well with his own estimate of his worth. In the
few interviews he gave, he kept coming back to the necessity of
greatness.
</P>
<P>
   There was no room now, he felt, for minor masters: The game of
music had to be played for ultimate stakes. And though he never
quite said so directly, he strongly implied that he judged himself
_ and demanded to be judged _ at the level of the few composers who
for him were the absolute greats: Bach, Beethoven, Schubert and
Debussy.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he can be placed in their ranks, only time _ not Time _
will tell, but it will never tell unless it is asked the question,
and it cannot be asked the question unless Barraque's works are in
the forum of debate.
</P>
<P>
   Since his death the question has never quite gone away, but
performances have been rare (as they always will be, given the
difficulty of his music), and only one recording appeared on CD
before this year: a coupling of his two last works _ the Concerto
for Clarinet, Vibraphone and Six Trios, and ``Time Restored'' (``Le
Temps Restitue''), for soprano, chorus and orchestra _ in good
performances conducted by Paul Mefano on Harmonia Mundi France. Now
the composer's complete output of seven works is available (CPO 999
569; three CDs), and the debate can properly continue.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, the listening can continue. The new recorded
performances, by the excellent Klangforum Wien and associated
musicians, all have many virtues, enough to meet the occasion, even
if only one of these performances _ that of ``Song After Song''
(``Chant Apres Chant''), for soprano, piano and percussion ensemble
_ is as thoroughly compelling as Barraque's music requires.
</P>
<P>
   This is part of what separates Barraque from nearly all of his
contemporaries: the urgency with which his music goes forward,
through whatever frenzy or chaos of disintegration. He accepted all
the absences music had acquired by 1950 _ absence of tonality,
absence of stable pulse or meter, absence of definable formal
shape, absence of historical resonance or measure _ but he never
accepted absence of meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, each of his works is a rush after meaning: a rush that
has to go on and on, because once any meaning has begun to be
formulated it must immediately be discarded. In ``Song After
Song,'' one meets that rush at full tilt, thanks most of all to the
conducting of Peter Rundel and the playing of the unnamed pianist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Song After Song'' is rich in delectable sound, again a
Barraque characteristic. Like his other vocal works _ ``Sequence,''
``Beyond Chance'' (``Au Dela du Hasard'') and ``Time Restored'' _
it has a strong percussion component (as does his tape music
Etude), and the rolling waves of drums and metal instruments evoke
the sea off Brittany, the place he most loved. His music's
restlessness is also that of the sea, as are its calm, distance and
illumination.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, the restlessness is one of feeling and thought.
Barraque's music exists in an almost perpetual state of
exhilaration, fear and desperation. And thought races on in his
music quite simply because there is nowhere for it to stop.
</P>
<P>
   It can latch onto a single note for a moment, and many of the
most memorable passages in Barraque are these places of radiant
unison or tentative agreement among instruments. But to affirm
anything larger than a note _ a motif, a harmony _ would be to risk
the illusion of restoring past certainties, and this Barraque could
never tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the young neo-Romantics of the 1970s, he felt the
need for music to be expansive, but he got there without aping the
habits of former times.
</P>
<P>
   More than observance of musical history is at stake here,
though. Most young composers in the 1950s and '60s were convinced
that they had to make a fresh start. What distinguished Barraque
was his sense that not only musical values but also general human
values had been called into question, and that his vocation as a
composer was to bear witness to the questioning, even if there was
no possibility of an answer's being found.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The search through ``Song After Song'' is the search for a frame
within which the self can identify itself. Time races and rages on;
all seems to be flux. Yet we hear a voice _ the voice of the
soprano, which might be an image of the voice we hear inside our
heads _ surviving the storm.
</P>
<P>
   In the concerto, with no human voice and no percussion, the
central persona is that of the clarinet, which is often at once
declamatory and lyrical in the manner of Barraque's soprano parts,
but can also be clownish. Again, the issues are those of
self-definition and relating to others.
</P>
<P>
   At first the clarinet is silent, and the piece skids off as a
rapturous fantasy for strings, the three bowed instruments (violin,
viola, cello) eventually joined by harp, harpsichord and guitar.
When the clarinet does appear, it seems to be seeking a response
from the orchestra of 19 soloists, a response that comes almost
perfectly, if briefly, from the English horn.
</P>
<P>
   The concerto is, again, full of glorious sounds, and the slow
performance here allows them generous space. Anyone new to Barraque
should start with ``Song After Song'' and this piece. Ernesto
Molinari is the highly effective soloist.
</P>
<P>
   Barraque's other purely instrumental work, the Piano Sonata, is
also given a slow performance, by Stefan Litwin, whose approach can
be justified: Barraque defined the tempos of the sonata only in
relative terms, and there are musical advantages in extension. One
hears every note and can follow how Barraque often uses Webern's
motive technique to create a kind of Penelope's web, where every
thematic idea is unpicked by what immediately follows.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the entanglement of the passages in static harmony
is possibly more telling. But missing is the clamorous intensity
and the sense of danger that comes only from speed.
</P>
<P>
   The sonata will no doubt be recorded again, and Barraque's
larger works really call out to be experienced live: This is public
music, made to speak to an audience. Even so, the new recordings at
last give us all access to what is, at the least, some of the most
remarkable music of the last half-century.

COMMENTARY: ARE N.Y. VOTERS BEING SEXIST OR JUST CHOOSY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ELISABETH KOLBERT   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Is it fair to bid farewell to Geraldine Ferraro and
Betsy McCaughey Ross with the same fond adieu?
</P>
<P>
   For all the obvious differences between the much-idolized former
vice presidential candidate and the much-ridiculed lieutenant
governor, the two followed almost occultly similar paths to their
defeats Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Both entered their respective primaries as odds-on favorites.
Both had more name recognition than their workaday opponents. Both
promised to raise and spend a lot of money. Both piqued news media
interest in a way that tended to leave their rivals gazing at the
backs of the television cameras.
</P>
<P>
   And both, of course, are women.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, Ferraro and McCaughey Ross made much of
their femaleness, frequently referring to themselves as mothers
who, by virtue of their sex, would bring a fresh perspective to
government. Ferraro went so far as to assert that women have a
whole different way of approaching political problems. ``Instead of
engaging in confrontation,'' she said at one point, ``women are
more apt to negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, however, this appeal did not do much good; when the
results were counted, neither woman even came close. For female
politicians in the state, it was the darkest day since, well, Ruth
Messinger got shellacked by Rudolph Giuliani in last year's mayoral
election in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The Empire State has never had a particularly happy track record
electing women. Just a few months before her death in March, Bella
Abzug, the grande dame of New York politics, reflected on the
dearth of women in high places and declared, ``I'm sick and tired
of seeing just men run this city and state.''
</P>
<P>
   Except as lieutenant governor, the very lowliest of all high
offices and indeed barely an elective office at all, a woman has
never won a statewide post in New York. Within the city limits,
women have fared somewhat better; two, Carol Bellamy and Elizabeth
Holtzman, have held citywide positions. Still, the record is
nothing to write NOW about.
</P>
<P>
   Many explanations have been offered for the slow advance of
women in politics in New York. Some have blamed what they see as
the state's superficially liberal but essentially conservative
electorate, while others have blamed its predominantly male party
structure.
</P>
<P>
   But neither theory seems to account for the dismal showing of
Ferraro or McCaughey Ross. Certainly, one can't make the argument
that they were victims of macho, clubhouse politics; both, in fact,
were sublimely indifferent to the interests of the party whose
nominations they were seeking.
</P>
<P>
   It was only last year that the lieutenant governor even became a
Democrat, and when party chairwoman Judith Hope delicately
suggested that she needed to ``pay some dues'' before seeking the
gubernatorial spot, McCaughey Ross simply ignored her.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Ferraro never let the party bosses, whoever they
might be, get in her way. She dithered in deciding whether or not
to run, even as many Democrats complained that her delay was
hurting the party. When she finally did enter the Senate race, it
was clearly on her own terms; she refused for the most part to
debate, or even to acknowledge, her two opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McCaughey Ross and Ferraro ran what can only be
described as disastrous campaigns. Both seemed to lack a clear
rationale for why they were running. Both fell wildly short of
their own fund-raising goals, thereby undermining their own
credibility. Both attracted attention for all the wrong reasons,
firing various aides and alternately blaming them for their
campaigns' problems and insisting their campaigns had no problems.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, while it surely could be argued that female candidates in
New York deserve better treatment, it could also be argued that New
York deserves better female candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, these two arguments may be
indistinguishable. Many women in state politics maintain that the
problem has a chicken-and-egg quality that makes it impossible to
know which came first: a bias that prevents women from winning or
just a bunch of women who have lost.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblywoman Catherine Nolan, a Queens Democrat, for example,
contends that if both major parties offered more encouragement to
women in midlevel offices, they would have stronger women
candidates to run for the high-level posts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think someone sits there and plots, `Let's keep women
out,''' she said. ``But still, we're constantly treading water.''

 &HT;    Fireants to face new weapon
 &HT;    By Dick Stanley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The first federally approved growth-inhibiting
baits to fight imported fire ants on crop and pasture land could be
on the market early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The baits, developed by the Texas Agricultural Extension
Service, do not leave harmful residues in food crops or slaughtered
animals. They are the first commercial fruits from research by the
Imported Fire Ant Research and Management Plan, a $2.5 million
state program involving scientists at four state agencies, the
University of Texas and Texas A&AMP;M and Texas Tech universities.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which issued its first report this week during what
Gov. George W. Bush has proclaimed Fire Ant Awareness Week, pools
scientific knowledge to combat the pests with the fiery sting.
</P>
<P>
   The ants cost Texans at least $300 million in annual damage,
most of it on cropland where the red ants destroy seeds and plants
and their mounds damage machinery, according to the extension
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, we have a bait product that can be applied
to land that is going to be cultivated for soybeans, food crops
like corn and sorghum, as well as to pastures where you're raising
livestock,'' said Bart Drees, a Texas A&AMP;M researcher and
coordinator of the state program.
</P>
<P>
   But Drees said some questions remain about the baits, which have
been approved by the Environmental Protection Agency and may be
marketed under the brand name Extinguish. Although they are
designed to inhibit growth in the ants' queens and their brood and
have passed four years of large-scale field tests by Texas A&AMP;M
researchers, it is unclear when is the best time to use the baits
or whether they will prove cost-effective for farmers and ranchers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in academic laboratories from Lubbock to Austin to
College Station, the battle continues to lessen the sting of the
ants, which arrived in Alabama ports in the 1930s by ship from
South America and spread to Texas 20 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Among the advances cited by the report during 1997-98:
</P>
<P>
   -UT researchers led by zoologist Larry Gilbert last year
released a species of Brazilian fly in Austin and Laredo. The flies
attack the ants outside their mounds. Additional species are being
studied.
</P>
<P>
   -Texas A&AMP;M continued to develop a bait station that has
entrances small enough to keep out the larger native fire ants,
which are not pests. Scientists hope to encourage the native ants
to compete for food with the imported ones.
</P>
<P>
   -Texas Tech scientists completed field studies of a fungus that
kills the ants inside their mounds.
</P>
<P>
   -Texas Tech has analyzed fire ant venom that may be useful for
future products because the ants sting each other as well as people
and animals.
</P>
<P>
   -Texas Tech researchers are conducting trials of a
patent-pending low-voltage device that electrocutes ants invading
sensitive electronic components. The tests are in Fort Worth, Waco,
Tyler, Houston and Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The state program also hopes to enlist communities,
neighborhoods and homeowners associations in fighting the ants,
which have infested more than 50 million acres in the eastern
two-thirds of Texas. Coordinated efforts are needed because
combatting the ants in one place alone only encourages them to
relocate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got a front yard, a back yard or ball yard, a church
yard or a back 40, you are affected,'' said state Rep. Tom Ramsay,
D-Mount Vernon, who sponsored the initial legislative proposal to
finance the program through 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say that now through October is the best time to
apply commercial baits such as Logic or Amdro on landscaping to
ensure there will be fewer imported fire ants in the spring.
</P>

FRATERNITY TO FACE INDICTMENT IN BINGE DRINKING DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLEMENT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Prosecutors will ask a grand jury Thursday to bring a
manslaughter charge against the Boston fraternity where MIT
freshman Scott Krueger ingested a fatal amount of alcohol at a
party last September, according to law enforcement sources.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Krueger, 18, triggered an 11-month investigation by
Suffolk District Attorney Ralph C. Martin II's office and Boston
police that once focused heavily on bringing criminal charges
against the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury, which has been meeting periodically since last
October, is expected to charge only the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity
and not pursue criminal charges against the fraternity's officers,
other individuals at the party, or MIT, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
   One official familiar with the investigation said Wednesday that
even if the fraternity corporation _ and not individuals _ faces
criminal charges, it will still be worth the months of effort
prosecutors and police have devoted to the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say it's much more meaningful if somebody goes away
for 18 to 20 years,'' the source said, ``but it's not an
all-or-nothing scenario. Just the fact that somebody is made to
answer for mistakes, for negligence, for criminal misconduct is
justice and it would be appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   MIT had vigorously opposed what would have been an unprecedented
prosecution of an educational institution for the death of a
student who was not living in campus housing. MIT argued that
prosecutors would have to stretch state law on manslaughter for
something that occurred at the legally independent Phi Gamma Delta
fraternity house.
</P>
<P>
   MIT President Charles Vest voluntarily appeared before the grand
jury along with other MIT officials, as the school pressed its case
that it should not be held criminally liable for Krueger's death.
Reacting to Krueger's death, MIT has decided to require freshmen to
spend their first year in dormitories beginning in 2001 and has
begun an education campaign on alcohol with incoming freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   Manslaughter carries a maximum punishment of 20 years'
imprisonment. But if an institution or a corporation is charged
instead of individuals, no one is sent to prison.
</P>
<P>
   John M. Moscardelli, a Boston lawyer not involved in the MIT
case, said Wednesday that prosecution of a corporation results in
fines or sanctions against the company's legal status or any
government-issued permits they hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't send a corporation to jail,'' he said. ``They get
hit with fines.''
</P>
<P>
   James Borghesani, spokesman for Martin, declined comment about
the Krueger case and the grand jury investigation. Leo Boyle, the
attorney for Krueger's parents, also declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Krueger was a freshman from Orchard Park, N.Y., a suburb of
Buffalo, who had pledged to the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, which
held a party on Sept. 27, 1998. Krueger, a high school honors
student, was found unconscious in a basement room. He died two days
later.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to his death, the Boston Licensing Board suspended Phi
Gamma Delta's dormitory license effective Jan. 15 of this year,
forcing all MIT students to find new living quarters. The alumni
corporation for the fraternity, Malcolm Cotton Brown Corp., has not
sought the city's permission to reopen the fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   In an open letter to students, Rosalind Williams, MIT dean of
students, said the school is negotiating an end to its ties with
Phi Gamma Delta, which has been associated with MIT since 1899.
``The chapter and MIT are now finalizing an agreement that would
formally end MIT's recognition of the fraternity,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   An official at Phi Gamma Delta's national headquarters could not
be reached for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Since they began their investigation, Boston police homicide
detectives have reportedly been frustrated in their search for the
identities of the people who purchased the alcohol served at the
fatal party or discovering who might have served Krueger the
alcohol. Most students quickly obtained lawyers after police
started asking questions, sources have said.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy M. Burke, an attorney who represents one of the
fraternity members, said Wednesday that Krueger's death was a
``tragedy'' but that it did not warrant criminal prosecution of
fraternity members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the facts as I know them, I firmly believe there was no
criminal conduct on the part of my client, or for that matter, any
of the individuals who were present during the course of this
event,'' he said. ``There simply wasn't any criminal intent on the
part of those who involved themselves in this fraternity
function.''

RADCLIFFE LEADERS PLAN 10-CITY BOOSTER TOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Insisting that her institution is
``exceedingly alive,'' the president of Radcliffe College will
announce Thursday a 10-city tour to reassure anxious alumnae that
reports of its death are greatly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   The alumnae of the 104-year-old women's college sent up a cry of
complaint when reports surfaced last spring that the school would
be fully consumed by its larger and more famous partner. Harvard
diplomas, which for women still showed the Radcliffe seal and
president's signature, would be unisex, and the longtime sister
school would be reconstituted as merely a research institution,
according to campus buzz.
</P>
<P>
   Alumnae said they had felt left out of the discussion, which
reportedly had been ongoing between Harvard and Radcliffe for a
year. Campus chatter and alumnae gossip centered on the question
posted in several e-mails: ``Is Radcliffe dead?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, while the campus has been waiting official word of the
change since spring, Radcliffe President Linda S. Wilson has
continued to insist that the rumors are merely that _ fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The buzz was created by people who are not knowledgeable,''
she said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As to the e-mail question, Wilson was even more vehement: ``That
is so uncharacteristic of the institution,'' she said. ``It's...
it's exceedingly alive, let's put it that way. It's really a
vibrant institution, intellectually and socially, and in terms of
service work and contributions in many different areas. It's hard
to find a more alive institution.''
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, Radcliffe last year topped its own fund-raising
record, with nearly $16 million in grants and gifts.
</P>
<P>
   The college was founded as an independent institution in 1894,
largely because Harvard refused to educate women on its campus
until after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   If Radcliffe is about to shutter itself now, Wilson is speaking
about it only in code.
</P>
<P>
   She bills her tour, which begins at the National Press Club in
Washington Oct. 8, as a chance to talk to Radcliffe alumnae about
``the future of the institution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to hear from you about the pressing issues for
Radcliffe and for women so that our planning for this institution
is as fully informed as possible,'' she wrote to alumnae.
</P>
<P>
   ``The institution is coming near the end of the accomplishment
of the goals we set for ourselves for the 1990s,'' she said in an
interview. ``So we are thoughtfully and deliberately and without
haste planning for a new decade and the new century.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson wouldn't comment on Radcliffe's often-tense relationship
with Harvard, present or future. The mission of the tour, she says,
is to talk with alumnae and collect their ideas for what role
Radcliffe should take.
</P>
<P>
   But the tour is also an attempt, she acknowledged, to quash
rumors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were ideas and suggestions that were reported that were
not really coming from the college,'' she said. ``They were assumed
to be decisions, which they were not. Since our alumnae care so
much about their institution, they were startled.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Radcliffe is in control of its own destiny,'' she said.
``We're anxious to share that with alumnae.''
</P>
<P>
   The tour ends in San Francisco Nov. 5, after stops in New York,
Atlanta, Philadelphia, Fort Lauderdale, Boston, Dallas, Chicago,
and Los Angeles. The tour may resume in the spring, Wilson said:
``We're not in a rush.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It might not have been apparent to most Americans,
but from the Czech perspective it was clear that by appearing at
President Clinton's side at a news conference Wednesday, President
Vaclav Havel was not merely repaying a friend for bringing his
country into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. A target of
accusations of philandering himself, he was standing in solidarity
with a fellow politician contending with a culture much more
judgmental than his own.
</P>
<P>
   Asked several times about Clinton's difficulties involving sex,
Havel looked up at the president with whom he had once played a
saxophone duet in Prague, called him a great friend and praised him
for his international leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed for more of a response, he said he would like ``to offer
congratulations to Mr. McGwire and to wish success to Mr. Sammy
Sosa.'' As for the rest of it, he said, ``I don't like to speak
about things which I don't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not that Czechs ignore sex or the concupiscent adventures
of their leaders or fellow citizens. Indeed no country has a
serious literature in which sex and politics intertwine so
profoundly.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best known example of this is Milan Kundera's novel,
``The Unbearable Lightness of Being,'' where the hero's conflicted
yearnings for the down-to-earth Tereza and the tantalizingly
ethereal Sabina serve as metaphors for broader themes of freedom
and responsibility. Similar uses of private affairs to reflect
public issues appear in the works of Ivan Klima and Josef
Skvorecky, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every contemporary Czech movie has some, usually comic,
adulterous scene. Not long after Havel married Dagmar Veskrnova in
1997, the new first lady, an actress, appeared fully and frontally
nude in a movie playing a character who at one point says she will
never have anything more to do with politicians.
</P>
<P>
   There was more public comment about the line than about the
nudity and in any case there was no condemnation of it. Billboards
in Prague and other cities show copulating couples in advertising
for products like office machines that would probably stir outrage
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   No, the Czechs, a nominally Catholic people, are at least as
openly fascinated by sex as Americans. They just do not seem to be
ready to blame or castigate those among them who stumble or fall
from grace, whether fictional characters or real politicians.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when on Monday, Miroslav Macek, the deputy leader
of the Civic Democratic Party, one of the major parties, was asked
why no sexual scandal had erupted in the Czech Republic, he
answered, ``Czechs have not been that terribly estranged from
nature as Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The married politician, a national figure who has never
concealed and sometimes flaunted his relationships with women,
declared, ``That men from time to time have women is fortunately
considered natural here.''
</P>
<P>
   One explanation for this high degree of tolerance and a rigid
respect of privacy is that under totalitarian Communism, private
lives, no matter how complex and intertwined, were regarded as
hallowed refuges. Jirina Siklova, probably the country's best known
feminist and the founder of the gender studies center at Charles
University addressed this theme in an article published in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under socialism,'' Ms. Siklova, wrote, ``because people could
not fulfill themselves in their often meaningless work for the
state, personal relationships were even more significant for them
than in Western countries. This is testified to by the high
marriage and divorce rates, the widespread sexual promiscuity and
the tolerance of extramarital sex, infidelity, and abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Havel's experience in these areas offers a contrast
with that of his saxophone partner. In the years that he was the
often imprisoned leading dissident in what was then Czechoslovakia,
Havel's closest friend and confidant was his wife, Olga, whom he
had known since 1956 and married in 1964. It was she who had
advised him that when he was being interrogated he should never
tell the police anything, ``not even the name of your dog.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also to her that he wrote from prison refining his ideas
on living in truth and talking truth to power. The correspondence
subsequently was published as the book, ``Letters to Olga.''
</P>
<P>
   Until her death of cancer in December 1996, they remained the
very best of friends. Yet as the American writer Paul Berman wrote
in the The New York Times Magazine, ``Vaclav and Olga had not been
exactly faithful to each other in the romantic sense, but they had
been loyal and close in other respects.''
</P>
<P>
   Such views of the marriage had circulated before the Communist
collapse within the tiny dissident community, where a record of
sexual fidelity had less to do with determining a persons standing
than loyalty to each other and a reputation for never cooperating
with the secret police.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Olga's death, Havel's relationship with Ms. Veskrnova
became apparent and its earlier existence was widely retroactively
assumed. She was referred to in the press as his lover but, though
Havel has his enemies, the issue of their relationship was never
raised in a political context, since politicians realized that this
was not a fertile area.
</P>
<P>
   But given the great respect that Olga had commanded, Ms.
Veskrnova was not readily accepted by large sectors of the public.
She was the butt of many jokes and the press, which withheld
comment on the propriety of having a first lady appear nude in a
film, did direct criticism at matters of decorum and housekeeping,
both of which the Czechs take seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Among these were her differences with Havel's brother, her
behavior when she whistled in Parliament, and most particularly on
her expulsion of Olga's dog from the castle. &QL;

CLASSES IN ETHICS, MANAGEMENT TO BE REQUIRED FOR N.Y. LAWYERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (smw) 
 By ALAN FINDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Seeking to keep lawyers up to date with a
changing legal landscape and improve the public's perception of
lawyers, the state's chief judges said Wednesday that lawyers who
practice in New York state would have to begin taking regular
continuing-education courses.
</P>
<P>
   The rules, which go into effect at the end of the year, will
require all 150,000 lawyers practicing in New York to take 24 hours
of courses every two years in subjects like ethics, basic legal
skills, law office management and specialized areas of practice.
</P>
<P>
   The courses are intended to keep lawyers informed about changes
in both the substance of the law and the changing nature of legal
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a piece of a program to enhance both the perception
and the fact of the legal profession as a genuinely noble
profession that serves the public well,'' Chief Judge Judith Kaye
said.
</P>
<P>
   The new courses are likely to be offered by the bar association,
law schools, private companies and even large law firms.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-seven states already require some kind of continuing
education for lawyers, although the type of courses varies widely,
the American Bar Association has said. Last year, New York began
requiring lawyers newly admitted to practice to take 32 hours
during their first two years.
</P>
<P>
   The requirements can be met in several ways, including
traditional classes, audio or video presentations and online
services. The goal was to make the program as flexible as possible,
said Jonathan Lippman, the state's chief administrative judge. ``We
tried to make the program the least intrusive that we could,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The requirements include four hours of courses in ethics, four
hours of courses in legal skills like writing, research and
negotiation, and 16 hours in courses on professional practice,
including managing a law office.
</P>
<P>
   The rules were developed in conjunction with the New York State
Bar Association and other professional groups, Lippman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to do it in a way that is inviting,'' he said.
``Some, obviously, are going to feel it's a burden. But I believe
the overwhelming bulk of the bar feels that this is a very good
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We've been heartened _ and I must say we had some
trepidation _ that the reaction from the bar has been
overwhelmingly positive. Most lawyers join us in this consensus
that we must as a profession aspire to the highest standard.''
</P>
<P>
   The state bar association, which for a long time has sponsored
voluntary continuing legal education, has urged making such courses
mandatory since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've come up with here is a device for people to stay up
to date,'' said bar association president Jim Moore. ``I hope that
this will signal to the public that this is a profession that cares
about the quality of service it delivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Some individual lawyers said that although they approved of the
goals, they were not sure that most lawyers would really benefit
from the new requirements. Under the rules, the lawyers will simply
have to certify every other year on a state registration form that
they took the courses. Some lawyers said they were skeptical that
that alone would accomplish the goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they really wanted to do it, they would give you tests,''
said a corporate lawyer in Manhattan, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The new requirements are partly intended to address public
skepticism about the legal profession, the state judges said. Other
changes have recently been established for the profession,
including the creation of standards of civility for lawyers and
judges, and new sanctions against frivolous lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to aspiring to the highest level of
professionalism and competence,'' Lippman said, and to winning
``the confidence of the public.''

VIEWING THE HOME RUN DERBY IN BLACK &AMP; WHITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIE AMPARANO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   While gripping the country with their race for the single-season
home run record, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa are stirring up
another hot topic: race relations in America.
</P>
<P>
   Some spectators can't help but ask: ``Is Sosa getting less
attention than McGwire because he is an immigrant from the
Dominican Republic? Or is McGwire getting more glory because he's
been leading the race for most of the season?''
</P>
<P>
   Step into Friday's Front Row restaurant inside Bank One Ballpark
and witness the subtle discord. Drinking and eating before the
Diamondbacks take on the Giants, people discuss the unpublished
points of the contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question about it. Racism is involved. McGwire
looks more like the American hero,'' asserted John Raleigh, a Tempe
accountant, who is 28 and White. ``People want to read about him
more. They want him to set the record. It's not really right,
though.''
</P>
<P>
   An anonymous caller responding to an &UR; ``Arizona Republic'' column
seems to prove that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allow me to point out something, sir,'' the caller said. ``The
most-home-runs-in-a-season title has always been a White man's
title. From Ruth, to Maris, to McGwire. You can forget about Sammy
Sosa.''
</P>
<P>
   Could that be true? Does the public favor McGwire because he's
White and the all-American model? Or do they love him because he's
the better slugger and was the first to shatter the record set in
1961 by Roger Maris?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, a recent unscientific &UR; ``USA Today'' &UR; survey
said 79 percent of Americans are rooting for the St. Louis
Cardinals' McGwire and only 16 percent for the Chicago Cubs' Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Internet search engines find McGwire's name more
than twice as often as Sosa's since January. (Sosa wasn't
considered a contender until June, when he hit a major league
record 20 home runs.)
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks pitcher Amaury Telemaco, also from the Dominican
Republic, tries to put things in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``McGwire did it first. If Sammy had done it first, he would
have gotten the applause,'' explained Telemaco, while warming up
for a home game. ``This is McGwire's country. Of course, people are
rooting for him. In the Dominican Republic, McGwire gets no
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Still many minorities feel the sting.
</P>
<P>
   To Hispanics, Sosa is a hero. He rose from poverty and
represents the Latinization of the game and the country.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Franco says Sosa is a better all-around player than
McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's better on defense, batting average and speed than
McGwire,'' said Franco, of Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Camarillo says it's like when Hank Aaron broke Babe Ruth's
career home run record.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many Whites were against Aaron,'' said Camarillo, a
46-year-old attorney. ``Why? Just because he was Black.''
</P>
<P>
   While pursuing Babe Ruth's record of 714 homers in 1974, Aaron
would receive hundreds of letters with racist threats. The threats
led him to hire a bodyguard.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Pena stands outside Bank One Ballpark with his two
grade-school-age sons and talks about the injustices to Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when Sosa tied the record, more should have been done
about him,'' said Pena, a 34-year-old construction company owner.
``I think if McGwire had been second, he would have gotten more
attention. Why didn't Sosa get a Corvette (as McGwire did) when he
tied the record?''
</P>
<P>
   On that matter Telemaco agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should have given Sammy something when he tied the
record,'' Telemaco said. ``At least a watch or something.''

TWA CHIEF CRITICIZES `ANTI-COMPETITIVE' AIRLINE ALLIANCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sounding notes more often uttered by the airline industry's
harshest critics, Trans World Airlines chairman and chief executive
Gerald Gitner denounced proposals by the country's six largest
carriers to pair off into three alliances as ``anti-competitive
schemes'' that the government should block.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Six tell us that consolidation of 70 percent of
domestic traffic into three airline systems _ all without the
bother of formal mergers and appropriate antitrust review _ should
proceed because of the tremendous consumer benefits,'' Gitner said
in a speech before an industry group in Manhattan. ``Amazingly,
they almost always say this with a straight face.''
</P>
<P>
   He contended that the proposed alliances, which would allow some
of the airlines to list their flights twice in computer reservation
systems, would deceive consumers while offering no new benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The first alliance was announced in January when Northwest
Airlines outbid Delta Air Lines for a controlling stake in
Continental Airlines. Fearing the competition posed by that link,
Delta then announced a deal with United Airlines, part of the UAL
Corporation, while American Airlines, a unit of the AMR
Corporation, and U S Airways Group formed a third grouping.
</P>
<P>
   That left TWA, the country's eighth-largest carrier, out in the
cold. ``If you are the ugly girl at the prom, and nobody asks you
to dance, then you would be the one to denounce proms,'' said
Raymond Neidl, an airline analyst with ING Baring Furman Selz in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Gitner's remarks are likely to be seized upon by industry
opponents. Several bills aimed at promoting airline competition
have been introduced in Congress this year.
</P>
<P>
   Only hours before Gitner spoke Wednesday, Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., introduced legislation that would give the government more
authority to review airline joint ventures, to penalize carriers
for unfair competition and to regulate fares on noncompetitive
routes. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who heads the Senate Commerce
Committee, also sponsored a bill.
</P>
<P>
   The progress of the proposed alliances appears to have stalled
recently, but many believe that the alliances will pick up momentum
again if the Northwest-Continental deal wins government approval.

NBC TO LAY OFF 200-300 NETWORK EMPLOYEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ NBC is planning to announce cutbacks Thursday that
will result in about 200 to 300 layoffs across all divisions of the
network.
</P>
<P>
   NBC president Robert Wright is expected to describe the plan for
cutbacks in a memorandum to the network staff Thursday, senior NBC
executive said Wednesday night. Wright will seek reductions of
between 4 percent and 5 percent of NBC's 6,500-member work force,
another executive said.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts at NBC, a division of General Electric Co., follow
moves by both CBS and ABC to cut costs. CBS chief operating officer
Mel Karmazin told Wall Street analysts last month that CBS would
seek to reduce annual costs by $180 million, partly through layoffs
of between 200 and 300 employees.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, a division of Walt Disney Co., has also initiated extensive
cost-cutting measures though it has never officially ordered
companywide layoffs. ABC executives have simply been told at budget
meetings to pare costs. Wednesday, ABC president Robert Iger told
network department heads that he had declared a moratorium on
salary increases and promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Several CBS executives have reported that the layoffs will fall
more heavily on that network's news division. But according to the
senior NBC executive, Wright, in his memo, will indicate that NBC's
news division _ and other divisions directly associated with
programming, such as its entertainment division _ will be less
affected than certain unspecified service departments.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts at every network are in response to rapidly escalating
costs, especially for programming. This past January, CBS and ABC
signed deals with the National Football League that will cost them
more than $4 billion each over the next eight years. NBC signed a
three-year deal with the television division of Warner Brothers for
the hit drama ``ER'' that will cost more than $280 million a year.
NBC has been the only network making significant profits, hitting a
high of about $500 million in the last year. But NBC had been
paying less than $50 million a year for ``ER'' and reaping enormous
profits on that show. NBC has also lost its hit comedy ``Seinfeld''
this season (though senior NBC executives say the high price the
network had been paying for ``Seinfeld'' had drastically reduced
the profit NBC was making on that show).
</P>
<P>
   In addition, NBC passed on the opportunity to renew its own NFL
package, and the NFL had been a profit center for the network.
</P>
<P>
   One senior NBC executive tied the cutbacks directly to the hit
on profits that network will be taking because of the enormous cost
increases for ``ER'' and other programming.
</P>
<P>
   Cassie Kanter, the corporate spokeswoman for NBC, said Wednesday
night that she could not confirm the decision to initiate layoffs.
But she said: ``The television landscape is changing. There has
been incredible competition for talent and programming, and so the
costs on the network side have increased.''

HAYWORTH SAYS HE WON'T USE CLINTON VIDEO
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIANNE FLYNN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
WASHINGTON _ Rep. J.D. Hayworth has taken the pledge.
<TEXT>
<P>
   No matter how explosive Presi dent Clinton's videotaped
deposition might be, the Arizona Republican said he won't be using
it in his campaign for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Some other House Republicans from Arizona, including Jim Kolbe,
Matt Salmon and John Shadegg, are saying the same thing as they
prepare for the likely release today of the tape that Democrats
worry will feed nationwide campaign com mercials aimed at their
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   There are few races in the country where use of the video of the
president's deposition with inde pendent counsel Kenneth Starr
would be more likely than Arizona's Congressional District 6.
</P>
<P>
   Hayworth is locked in one of the tightest re-election battles in
the country against Democrat Steve Owens, who lost in 1996 by fewer
than 2,500 votes. Last time around, their race was among the
muddiest in the state. Moreover, Owens has ties to the
administration _ he was state director for then-Sen. Al Gore, now
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, Congressman Hayworth will not use the videotape,'' said
Jeff Breedlove, Hayworth campaign con sultant. ``There are other
ways to make the point that Steve Owens has invited Bill Clinton to
campaign for him.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Wednesday that he could
envision unflattering bits of the tape ending up in campaign
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House is going to have to employ the video however they
see fit. We just hope it's not misused,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Owens doesn't exactly trust his
 &UR; opponent, according to a state
 &UR; ment from his campaign. Owens
 &UR; said it `remains to be seen
 &UR; whether the incumbent will keep
 &UR; his pledge as the campaign prog
 &UR; resses.'' He reiterated earlier
 &UR; statements that he strongly disap
 &UR; proves of the president's conduct
 &UR; and wishes the issue resolved
 &UR; swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   As Republicans try to take the high ground in dealing with the
sensational material Starr gathered about Clinton's affair with
former intern Monica Lewinsky, Hayworth's attitude about the tape
may become the rule rather than the exception.
</P>
<P>
   House Rules Committee Chair man Gerald B.H. Solomon, R-N.Y., who
drafted the rules governing release of Starr's material, recom
mended at a Wednesday news con ference that members avoid using the
tape. Republicans, he said, should focus on issues of impor tance,
such as tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., a Harvard-trained lawyer who
shared the podium with Solomon, said, ``I certainly have no
intention of using it, and I would encourage others not to for 101
reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Shadegg said the stakes are too high for the tape to be used for
narrowly political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impeachment should not be exploited by anybody as a campaign
issue. It is too serious for that,'' Shadegg said. ``It would
belittle and demean the significance of the issue and of his
(Clinton's) defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon, who is unopposed after his Democratic challenger died,
said that he wouldn't use the videotape in his campaign and that he
doesn't think other Republicans should, ei ther.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that would be beyond the pale to use the footage. We
ought to be judged on our own merits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon said candidates should be judged not on what Clinton did
but on ``philosophical differences be tween the parties, policy
differences and the individual candidates them selves.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Solomon and Cox said the House Judiciary Committee, which
has custody of the 18 file boxes filled with Starr's evidence,
likely will meet this morning to vote on releasing the videotape,
and perhaps other supporting documents along with it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was videotaped testifying from the White House for more
than four hours on Aug. 17. The tape, various media outlets have
reported, supposedly shows Clinton visibly angered by off-screen
ques tioners. Portions of the testimony have been leaked and
published, but there have been no descriptions of the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The tape should be as public as Starr's 453-page report, which
was released by the House on Friday, Cox and Solomon said. The
presi dent doesn't oppose its release, they said, and members of
Congress who aren't seated on the Judiciary Com mittee are
clamoring for access so they can make independent deci sions on
Clinton's veracity.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, at an afternoon news conference, said he had assumed
all along that the tape would become public, and he sought to shrug
off the potential impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not of so much concern to me,'' he said. ``I mean, you
know that I acknowledged an improper relationship and that I
declined to discuss the details.'' &QL;

DE LA HOYA NOT PERFECT, BUT FRIENDS NOT WORRIED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Those closest to Oscar De La Hoya could find a lot
of reasons to worry.
</P>
<P>
   The demands on his time have grown at the same dramatic pace as
his name recognition and bank account. Personal appearances,
fashion shoots, interviews and constant scrutiny could overwhelm
even the most stable of 25-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   And recent newspaper articles confirmed the obvious _ De La Hoya
likes to have a good time. He has gambled hundreds of thousands of
dollars in Las Vegas and was seen drunk and behaving in a rowdy
manner recently at a nightclub in Cabo San Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   So are De La Hoya's friends concerned? Nah.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya is not perfect, they admit, but they are impressed
with the way he has handled his celebrity in light of the pressure
and insist none of the outside influences have affected his boxing
career. Put simply, they trust him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never said Oscar was an angel,'' said Mike Hernandez, one
of his closest advisers. ``You guys (reporters) are the ones who
created that image. He's no angel, but he's a good kid. And he's a
good role model.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't envy him, though. No way. That's a lot to put on the
shoulders of a young kid.''
</P>
<P>
   No one associated with the WBC welterweight champion, who
defends his title against Julio Cesar Chavez on Friday, is
concerned about the drinking. The idea that a single young man
might want to blow off steam occasionally isn't unreasonable to any
of them. As his longtime promoter, Bob Arum, said: ``He's human.''
</P>
<P>
   The gambling is a slightly different story, although Hernandez
said De La Hoya doesn't have a problem. Arum and Hernandez were
concerned enough that they arranged to have his credit limited at
several casinos in Las Vegas more as a product of caution than
panic. They say De La Hoya has no problem with their decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gambling could be a problem and is something Mike and I
are dealing with,'' Arum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oscar says it's a good idea _ until his credit runs out,'' he
added with a laugh. ``You have to realize that it's very difficult
to understand the value of a dollar when you've made untold
millions at his age and in light of where he comes from.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, I think he handles all this very well. He's a very
intelligent kid with good instincts, but he needs guidance.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, who admits that he sometimes feels overwhelmed,
seems to learn from his experiences. He said he was upset initially
when news of his escapades south of the border was made public. He
dismissed it as just another negative creation of the media.
</P>
<P>
   Upon reflection, he says he has used it and his advisers'
reaction to his gambling to make himself a better person.
</P>
<P>
   ``It woke me up and helped me realize that I'm just human,'' he
said. ``And it made me think, `If I want to make history in boxing,
if I want to become the best champ out there, I have to stay
focused on boxing.' That's all I have to do and that's what I
!ital!will!off! do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a reality check. It was like, `I'm doing something
wrong. Stop it. That's it.'''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya already is making history in boxing. He's considered
by many to be the best in the game, apparent proof that outside
factors haven't had much of an impact on his boxing career.
</P>
<P>
   Those who do his scheduling limit his business activities year
round and tightly monitor contact from visitors once he goes up to
his Big Bear training camp before a fight.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if he needs much help, though. He has the reputation
for being a self-motivated perfectionist in the gym with a knack
for shutting out the outside world once it's time to train. Arum
believes he's compulsive about training, perhaps the result of his
still-demanding father, Joel. De La Hoya says he's simply used to
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how to stay focused,'' he said. ``I know how to block
out anything anytime. Nothing can break me. I just grew up with it.
Ever since I was small, I've been that way. When I fought Golden
Gloves, I used to go to school all day and fight for a championship
at night, shutting everything out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes naturally.'' Which longtime trainer Roberto Alcazar
has known all along.
</P>
<P>
   He knows about his fighter's love for the good life. He also
knows about his fighter's love for boxing and his keen
understanding of its role in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been educated to know he's a fighter first,'' Alcazar
said. ``He knows that without boxing, all the other things around
him cannot come. He knows what he wants and that gives him strength
to deal with the negative things around him....
</P>
<P>
   ``After a fight, when it's time to go, I just tell him to be
careful. I know he'll be all right.''

D'AMATO, SCHUMER START RIGHT OFF WITH ATTACKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (smw) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ The race for Senate took off at a furious pace
Wednesday, as Rep. Charles Schumer, the Democratic nominee,
presented himself as a ``law-and-order Democrat'' with a tougher
record on crime than Sen. Alfonse D'Amato. The Republican incumbent
derided Schumer as ``a liberal Brooklyn Democrat'' and complained
that he was already engaging in ``personal negative attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, his resounding primary victory on Tuesday behind him,
turned immediately to the subject of crime, flying here to pose in
front of a gleaming blue-and-white police cruiser, where he ticked
off crime bills he had sponsored in Congress. It was a pre-emptive
effort to rebut Republican efforts to portray Schumer as another in
a long line of New York City liberals running for statewide office.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, who spent the day in Washington, fought back with two
television advertisements, one jocular and the other reminiscent of
the hard-hitting way he inaugurated the 1992 general election.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer awoke on Wednesday morning to watch a new advertisement
featuring a rare instance in which two of New York City's most
popular leaders _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Ed Koch, the former
mayor _ shared a television spotlight, in this case to endorse
D'Amato. The advertisement ended with the two men, who are on less
than friendly terms, playfully arguing about who gets to deliver
the concluding line.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time Schumer retired Wednesday night, D'Amato was on
the air with a second spot that mentioned the congressman by name.
``Chuck Schumer is a New York City liberal and he proves it every
day,'' an announcer says, according to a script of the new spot.
``Liberal Chuck Schumer. Wrong on taxes. Wrong on welfare. Wrong on
crime. Wrong for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The fast-paced day of events, as Schumer and D'Amato each sought
to beat the other in setting the tone and discussion of the
campaign, suggested a frenetic and forceful contest at hand. It
also left little question that D'Amato is in for a different
challenge than he faced in 1992, when he defeated Robert Abrams by
a single percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike 1992, Schumer does not have to deal with the complication
of reassembling a party fractured by an acrimonious primary. He
appeared with his two opponents, Geraldine Ferraro and Mark Green,
at a news conference in Manhattan on Wednesday morning, where the
three Democrats took turns assailing D'Amato. And unlike Abrams,
who in 1992 disappeared from the public scene to begin raising
money, Schumer burst forth onto the campaign trail. He will be in
Rochester on Thursday, for another event playing up crime.
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of the 1992 campaign, the language that came
out of both camps was relatively mild Wednesday. Nonetheless, in a
sure indication of where both men expect to drive the campaign,
each accused the other of negative campaigning, a gambit that
candidates often use so they can argue later on that they are not
responsible for campaigns that turn particularly ugly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expect the negative ads,'' Schumer said in Manhattan. ``Expect
him to distort my record. Expect Al D'Amato to be a bully. But I've
got a message for Al D'Amato: You've never faced a Chuck Schumer
before.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, in an interview in Washington, said it was Schumer who
was engaging in negative campaigning. ``I think what we see is,
unfortunately, instead of sticking to the issues, engaging in this
kind of personal attack,'' he said. ``And that is what Bob Abrams
engaged in. It's wrong. He lost and so will Schumer on this.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato said he was upset to hear Schumer question his
trustworthiness and to describe him as a bully. ``I mean, where
does he get that?'' he said. ``I have never in any way or at any
time, in a way toward him, done anything that he could characterize
as that.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, taking note of D'Amato's television spots so far, said,
``Isn't it pathetic that after 18 years in the Senate, he can't put
his face or his own voice on his television ads.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Buffalo, Schumer moved quickly to try to win the upper
hand on an issue that might argue against the notion of him as a
liberal: crime. He noted that he had sponsored, or helped write,
legislation to restrict the sale of handguns and assault weapons,
to put more police officers on the street and to impose the death
penalty for some federal crimes. D'Amato voted against much of
Schumer's legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a tough-on-crime, law-and-order Democrat,'' Schumer said.
``I have been all along. I believe in people's rights. But I also
believe that criminals, particularly violent criminals, should be
treated with the punishment that their crimes deserve. And despite
his bluster, Al D'Amato is not close to being as tough on crime as
Chuck Schumer.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato responded by asserting that it was he who had pushed for
``the kind of thing that people need and want, and that is tougher
penalties for criminals.'' But, he added, ``unfortunately, it was
Chuck Schumer who worked and voted against tougher penalties for
dangerous criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's advertisement featuring Giuliani and Koch trading warm
endorsements of the senator fit into D'Amato's effort to blur
partisan lines in a Democratic state. Schumer appeared unsurprised
by the ad, responding with newspaper clips recounting the times
Giuliani had publicly assailed D'Amato's ethics.
</P>
<P>
   At City Hall, Giuliani said that he no longer had the concerns
about D'Amato's ethics that he had once voiced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had disagreements and difficulties with Senator D'Amato,
and sometimes both of us would get somewhat emotional about it,
maybe more than we should, and at the height of argument say
something about each other that we shouldn't have,'' the mayor
said.

TRANSIT SERVICE TO BE EXPANDED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the boom in subway and bus ridership showing no
signs of abating, transit officials said Wednesday that they
planned to spend $44 million to expand service over the course of
1999.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which is to be announced Thursday, will add 2,400 bus
trips and about 200 subway trips a day to a system that after two
years of dizzying growth in ridership is often packed to capacity.
</P>
<P>
   A transit official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
that the $44 million expenditure, combined with the $65 million
that has been spent in the last two years to gradually add new
service, ``is the largest increase in service that we can find in
our records.'' The increases follow closely on the heels of $48
million a year in service cuts imposed by the authority in 1995
after the city withdrew $112 million in subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, service will increase on 17 subway lines,
including the No. 1 line in Manhattan and the A train. The transit
official said that both those lines were not only overcrowded
during peak hours, but were also increasingly crowded before and
after the traditional peak.
</P>
<P>
   Service will also increase on the No. 7 line, which is growing
more crowded on weekends and during other off-peak hours. In
addition to more express bus service between Manhattan and Staten
Island, Brooklyn and Queens, the plan calls for extra crosstown bus
runs in Manhattan and increases on several lines in the Bronx and
Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The added service, officials said, will reduce waiting times on
some subway lines by a minute or so during during peak travel times
and by two or three minutes during off-peak times. A bus or subway
train traveling its route from beginning to end constitutes one
trip.
</P>
<P>
   The money for the new service, the official said, is already
called for in the MTA's five-year financial plan. It is expected to
come from several sources, including increased fare revenue and
dedicated taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The buses and subway cars for the additional trips will come
from the pool of 1,720 new buses and 1,080 new subway cars that the
authority already has on order. Some of the buses have already
arrived and the first subway cars are scheduled to be delivered by
the start of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Russianoff, the staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign,
an advocacy group that has been pressing for more transit service,
welcomed the planned service improvements. But he said the
authority had already fallen far behind in serving the riders who
have flocked to the system since it began offering fare discounts
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good step,'' Russianoff said, ``but they've got a long
way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   According to MTA figures, the authority increased bus service by
3.6 percent from January 1997 to May 1998 as ridership grew by 34
percent. Subway service increased by 0.8 percent during the same
period, as ridership grew by 12 percent, to more than 4 million
riders a day.
</P>
<P>
   The increases that are being announced Thursday represent about
a 3 percent increase in the number of weekday subway trains and a 5
percent increase in the number of weekday bus trips.
</P>
<P>
   While the agency is projecting that ridership will grow much
more than that by mid-2000 _ about 9 percent on the subways and 5
percent on the buses _ the official said the service increase
should be adequate because most of the growth in ridership was
expected to be during off-peak hours, when there are usually seats
available.
</P>
<P>
   Ridership is expected to continue to increase as more people
take advantage of unlimited-ride passes and other fare discounts.
Since July 1997, the authority has begun offering free
bus-to-subway transfers, an 11-rides-for-the-price-of-10 Metrocard,
and reduced express-bus fares.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the authority introduced a pass allowing unlimited
rides for $17 a week or $63 for 30 days. Officials have refused to
say how well the new passes are selling.
</P>
<P>
   Russianoff said that as more monthly and weekly passholders
begin riding the system, the real judges of whether the authority
is providing enough buses and trains will be the riders.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to have an elbow in your rib,'' he said,
``you're going to want more service.''
</P>
<P>
   Russianoff said that the Straphangers Campaign was about to
begin an election-season drive to encourage riders to petition Gov.
George Pataki and other officials for more service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time is right,'' Russianoff said. ``There's a confluence
of many factors, which include a lot more riders, a budget
surplus'' _ $40 million as of the end of May _ ``and an election.
That's as good as it gets.''

CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION GOES FOR SOME VISUAL FLAIR 
</HEADLINE>
  (smw) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It'S not quite what he had in mind when he chose to
become an artist, but Bradley McCallum insists he didn't mind
measuring the sidewalks of Malcolm X Boulevard a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Using a tape measure, he determined the square footage of each
block where the rally called the Million Youth March by its
organizers was to be held, and then, estimating that each person
would need 5 square feet of pavement, he calculated that 148,655
people could fit into the 29 blocks of Harlem where the rally was
to take place.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the life of the new artist-in-residence at the New York
Civil Liberties Union. One minute he's preparing a sculptural
exhibition on police brutality, the next he's testifying before a
federal judge on how many people should be included in the permit
requested by the youth rally organizers. And much of the rest of
the time he's trying to explain to people just why a civil
liberties union needs an artist-in-residence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about the power of the visual image, the way in which an
artist might interpret certain symbols and reclaim them,'' he said
recently in the organization's new downtown offices near the Staten
Island Ferry terminal. ``What the police were doing at the rally
was taking advantage of visual, spatial language to show blue
power: the barricades, the helicopter, the riot gear, the men on
horseback, the fleets of motorcycle cops. What we need to do is use
visual language to express the message of our campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, McCallum designed a group of wooden barricades for
the civil liberties group that very much resemble the blue
restraints used by the Police Department, except that they say,
``Civil Liberties Line _ Do Not Cross.'' The barricades, which
emphatically illustrate the message that free speech should not be
trampled, were used at the group's July 4 rally at City Hall to
protest the information policies of the Giuliani administration.
</P>
<P>
   If it seems a bit jarring that the New York Civil Liberties
Union should suddenly yearn for some visual flair, it may be
because the organization has long been better known for its
unrelenting earnestness than for any sense of humor or style. Among
liberal advocacy groups, it is like the gaunt, hard-working law
student more concerned with finishing a late-night brief than with
his frayed corduroy coat.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, the group's executive director, acknowledges it's
a bit of a leap to hire a nonlawyer, but says he had no trouble
convincing his contributors and board members that a new approach
was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love lawyers, but with all that's going on in the city, we
have a message we're trying to get out, and you can't do it with
the brochures that lawyers write in legalese,'' Siegel said. ``An
artist has a different vision of what we do that can enhance and
complement our work. And Brad is incredibly idealistic and very
talented.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It'S hard to imagine the ubiquitous Siegel finding someone he
considers more idealistic than himself, but McCallum may fit the
description. At age 32, he has had several large artworks with
strong political or social themes installed around Connecticut,
including one at the John Slade Ely House in New Haven called ``War
Tools 2,'' which included a series of condoms stuffed with rifle
shells and oil. (The Army used condoms during the Persian Gulf war
to prevent sand from getting into rifles.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, when McCallum was a graduate student at Yale, he
installed a project called ``Shroud: Mothers' Voices'' at New Haven
City Hall that featured silk rubbings of photographs of gunshot
victims in the city, accompanied by videotaped interviews with the
victims' relatives. His most recent work, ``The Manhole Project,''
at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford last year, consisted of 228
stacked manhole covers made from 11,000 guns confiscated by state
troopers and melted down. Four kiosks were set up that played tapes
about the victims of the guns.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, there wasn't much doubt about a philosophical bond
between Siegel and McCallum, and when McCallum proposed a formal
relationship with the civil liberties union earlier this year,
Siegel saw the possibilities and found the money. The group was
already planning to begin a three-year campaign against police
misconduct, starting this month, and McCallum's first major task
will be to plan a traveling exhibition on the subject, again
featuring taped oral histories and a still-undetermined design
element. He says the tapes will also include the recollections of
police officers about violence directed against them.
</P>
<P>
   McCallum, who grew up in Madison, Wis., and now works in a
studio near the Brooklyn Navy Yard, has had an interest in pottery
and sculpture since high school, and began to combine it with
politics after a college professor asked a class to consider the
responsibility to society of a creative imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people rarely seem to have an experience with a work of
art,'' McCallum said, ``and I thought there must be some way for an
artwork to have relevance to a community outside of a very elite
group of people who have been initiated into the art world. That's
what first drew me to public art: the idea of a body of work that
uses poetics to filter in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   But the mundane called: he ended the conversation and returned
to writing grant proposals for his new employer.

NYC PRINCIPALS VETO TRADING TENURE FOR HIGHER PAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This city has offered a record raise of more than 30
percent over five years to its public school principals _ in
exchange for giving up their right to lifetime tenure and for
working a 12-month year. Negotiators for the principals have
rejected it.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani administration officials said they offered the raise _
which far outstrips the 11 percent for most city unions _ out of
determination to treat principals like professional managers and to
hold them more strictly accountable for the success and failure of
the city's 1.1 million schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Principals, however, denounced the offer Wednesday as insulting
and akin to slavery _ saying that the increase in working hours
would make the raise a wash or worse _ and broke off contract
negotiations. They said that forcing them to give up their job
security would be tantamount to union-busting and would strike at
the heart of the union's interest in protecting its 4,400 members
from politics and favoritism.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew have
made eliminating tenure for principals a linchpin of their agenda
to reform New York City public schools. They argue that like a
corporation head or a precinct commander, the chancellor and his
superintendents should have the power to demote or dismiss bad
principals and to reassign good ones where they can do the most
good.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, which is part of state law, principals
cannot be removed from their buildings without union approval and
cannot be demoted or dismissed without often-lengthy disciplinary
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the city's offer, the principals would agree to give
up their right to tenure and would instead have a contract
requiring them to meet standards, including getting students to
perform at certain levels on standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The principals have said they're underpaid and they want to be
treated more as executives, as managers,'' Deputy Mayor Randy
Levine said Wednesday. ``But you can't have it both ways. If you
want to be treated as real managers and get more money, you have to
be productive for the city and the Board of Education.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Deputy Chancellor Lewis Spence said the board would not back
down from its drive to make principals more accountable. ``If the
system is going to move to rapid success the single most powerful
catalyst for educational change is strong leadership,'' he said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came an extraordinary distance and they ran in fear,'' he
added. He said the board wanted more flexibility to move good
principals and the right to dismiss bad ones.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of the ferocity of the battle over tenure that
the administration is willing to offer principals and assistant
principals much higher raises than those negotiated with teachers,
police, firefighters and sanitation workers. Other city unions
received 11 percent in raises over five years, or 13.3 percent
including benefits, city officials said. The city offered an
additional 20 percent raise to the principals, for a total package
of 33.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   City officials say the raise _ which they term a productivity
increase _would average $18,000 to $20,000 above the raises for
other city workers. For a high-school principal with top pay of
$83,921 after 15 years, the raise would total more than $26,000, to
$109,937, and it would be $111,867 with benefits, city officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   City Labor Relations Commissioner James Hanley called the raise
``incredibly huge,'' but said: ``Obviously, it was a package that
made sense for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   But it did not persuade the leadership of the Council of
Supervisors and Administrators, the union for principals, assistant
principals and other supervisors, which has demanded that the
contract go to arbitration. The union has worked without a contract
since February 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Union president Donald Singer predicted an exodus of principals
to the suburbs, where he said they earn $25,000 more on average. He
conceded that the city's offer was substantial, but said it would
not make up for the rise in working hours. Under the current
contract, principals work 10 months of the year; their day is now
seven hours and 20 minutes. The city wants their days extended by
two to three hours and the year by two months.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, however, the major issue on both sides was the battle
over tenure. Singer said the city had demanded that the union go
with it to the Legislature to ask for the abolition of the tenure
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to be extorted,'' Singer said. ``No one in the
suburbs is being told by their board of education and their mayor
to go to Albany and to abolish tenure. I don't want to use the word
slavery. But someone in our executive board said that if we
accepted this, we might as well be slaves.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials used equally harsh words. ``It's really the most
naive leadership,'' Levine said of the union. ``Donald Singer I
think has no comprehension of reality, let alone how to reach an
agreement. I feel very badly for his members.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Domanico, executive director of the Public Education
Association, an advocacy group that monitors city schools, said the
city's proposal could attract fresh blood to a system that he said
cannot attract top-quality principals. He said that he believed
that the chancellor wanted to evaluate principals fairly and
``would not support some kind of witch hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaction was mixed among rank-and-file principals. Several said
they would willingly give up tenure if they got more control over
conditions in their schools _ like the ability to hire and dismiss
teachers and to make other decisions without wading through deep
bureaucracy. Teachers are also protected by the tenure law, but the
administration argues that they are not managers, so they are
entitled to different conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally don't have a problem with moving to management
and to being viewed as a manager, and managers do work a longer
year,'' said Alexander Corbluth, principal of the High School for
Environmental Studies in Manhattan. ``But with that comes the power
to carry out decisions and to manage one's school as one would like
to.''

RUNNING MATE GIVES NEW FIRE TO KENNELLY CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  (smw) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WETHERSFIELD, Conn. - Barbara Kennelly, whose Democratic
campaign for governor has never caught fire, caught a break in the
primary on Tuesday when voters gave her a running mate who excites
party members.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats scrambled Wednesday to try to enjoy the lift from the
nomination of Denise Nappier, who will run with Mrs. Kennelly on
Nov. 3 as the Democratic candidate for treasurer. As an
African-American and the lone minority candidate on the Democratic
slate, Ms. Nappier could help her party hold on to its traditional
constituencies in a year when Republicans have been bragging about
fielding three minority candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``She will help facilitate a real effort to reach into our
cities and minority communities in a way that we could not have
done without her,'' said Jonathan Pelto, Mrs. Kennelly's campaign
manager. ``There is a real sense that we have crossed the divide
into the last and most important phase of the campaign. There's a
real sense that things are going to happen, are happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is a sign of the straits of Mrs. Kennelly's campaign
that she and her staff seized on the nomination of an undercard
candidate as their ticket to ride _ or at least to fight for two
more months. Mrs. Kennelly lags behind Gov. John Rowland in polls
and fund-raising, and spent weeks this summer in an embarrassing
public search for a Democrat of stature who was willing to run as
her candidate for lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, though, she could celebrate the victory of Ms.
Nappier, the treasurer of the city of Hartford, who defeated her
opponent, Frank Lecce, by 59 percent to 41 percent. An air of
giddiness swept Mrs. Kennelly's campaign headquarters in this town
just south of Hartford, where staff members celebrated a birthday
by singing over the office-wide speakerphone system.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nappier, who helped voters pronounce her name by using the
slogan, ``Connecticut's happier with Nappier,'' had two versions of
her campaign pin _ one in the standard blue and white, and one
using an African kente cloth as a background.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly said she believes the ``bad months'' for her
campaign are over. ``This is a tough race, but we have the team
together now and I'm feeling good about things,'' she said in a
telephone interview from Washington, where she held a fund-raising
reception Wednesday night. ``We're going to play it all the way,
and as hard as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   As Mrs. Kennelly contemplated political resurrection, Rowland
took to the airwaves this morning with a commercial taking credit
for progress in an area his rival had hoped to make her signature
issue: giving patients more leverage over health maintenance
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Washington politicians talk about HMO reform, Gov.
Rowland is doing something about it,'' the narrator says over a
shot of a darkened Capitol dome. ``Gov. John Rowland _ putting
patients first. Building a better Connecticut.'' His campaign plans
to broadcast the advertisement often, spending $200,000 over about
10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly contends that the advertisement is misleading.
Officials at her campaign say they have the money for only four or
five weeks of advertising. With seven weeks until the election,
they have to make the agonizing choice of spending the money now
and risking coming up short in the days before the vote, or holding
their fire and allowing Rowland's pitch to sink in.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennelly campaign is testing about a dozen commercials,
including one with Mrs. Kennelly at a day-care center in
Manchester. All sit on the shelf for now, the victims of her cash
shortage. In early July, the last time the candidates had to report
the state of their finances, Rowland had raised $4.3 million and
had $2.4 million left to spend. Mrs. Kennelly had raised $2 million
and had $630,000 left to spend.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland has also been effective using the power of his office.
Last week, Mrs. Kennelly held a news conference in New Haven to
challenge Rowland to sign a ``Patient Protection Act,'' promising
support for legislation to protect the rights of patients of health
maintenance organizations. The event drew no cameras and just three
reporters, two of whom came to ask her about President Clinton's
woes.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Rowland announced on Monday that he had intervened
with two insurance companies and temporarily restored health
insurance for 8,000 senior citizens in rural Connecticut who had
been notified they would be dropped because providing the coverage
was not cost-effective for the companies.
</P>
<P>
   The article was on the front page of state newspapers, and
television stations carried live reports from the Capitol. Rowland
was not unaware of the attention his initiative would receive on
dinnertime newscasts. When a reporter asked how the patients would
be notified of their reprieve, Rowland looked at the clock, which
read 4:30 p.m., and said, ``The notification will begin in about an
hour and a half.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly contends that Rowland's deal with the insurance
companies was ``a quick fix'' that was not all that it seemed. But
she is left with the problem of how to get that word out.
</P>
<P>
   Next door to Mrs. Kennelly's office, 20 employees are cranking
up a statewide campaign to promote Democratic candidates, including
U.S. Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, who is expected to win re-election
easily. The campaign managers from the statewide Democratic
campaigns held a brown-bag lunch Wednesday to figure out how they
can, as one participant put it, ``refine the message and turn up
the volume.''
</P>
<P>
   This coordinated effort, the Campaign for Connecticut Families,
is financed by the individual campaigns, the party, labor unions
and other sources. Planners hope to build excitement about the
ticket by having the candidates march together in parades and go on
bus tours to festivals and fairs.

<P>
   In Tuesday's other statewide primary, state Rep. Susan Bysiewicz
defeated state Re. Ellen Scalettar by 52 percent to 48 percent to
win the nomination for secretary of the state, which is often a
steppingstone to higher office.
</P>
<P>
   In the race for the Democratic nomination to replace Mrs.
Kennelly as U.S. representative for the First District, John Larson
slipped past Miles Rapoport by 1,688 votes out of 43,000 cast.
Larson, a former president pro tem of the state Senate, took 46
percent of the vote in a four-way race and Rapoport, the secretary
of the state, had 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Hartford, Barnaby Horton, whose opponents had complained
about negative telephone calls paid for by his campaign for the
Democratic nomination for a seat in the state House of
Representatives, won with 38 percent of the vote in a three-person
race.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Mark Mellman, a leading Democratic pollster, has
made the rounds on Capitol Hill in recent days, urging his clients
not to stray from talking about issues and assuring them that the
White House scandal will not damage their own prospects in
November. But they won't listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is disbelief,'' Mellman said of Democratic lawmakers.
``They say, `Are you crazy?' or, `Certainly that may be true today,
but I don't think that's where it's going.' There is, `All I hear
on television and read in the newspaper is how this is killing us!'
''
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton first admitted his affair with Monica Lewinsky last
month _ and that he had lied about it _ most Democrats hewed to a
unified message. They said the president's conduct was deplorable,
but he admitted his mistakes and now it was time for the nation to
put the matter to rest, and focus on ``real'' issues like health or
education.
</P>
<P>
   But now, anticipating that the scandal will become a real threat
to Democrats, many lawmakers have been going out of their way to
harshly speak out against Clinton, even against the mass of advice
from party strategists who insist that there is no public clamor
for the president to be impeached or forced from office.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than sticking to their original statements, many
Democrats have revised and amplified their own remarks, scolding
Clinton not just for his behavior and his handling of the affair,
but for how the whole matter could threaten Democrats in November.
Few Democrats have publicly ruled out the possibility of
impeachment _ and almost no prominent lawmaker in the party has
publicly offered an unsparing defense of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the searing critiques continued. Rep. James Moran,
D.-Va., raised the prospect that Clinton could be impeached on
perjury charges. ``I think the president would help himself a great
deal if he would get off this business of saying one thing in
public and having his lawyers do another thing in court, that he's
got to stop this deliberate deception in terms of whether or not he
had sexual relations,'' he said. ``It's eroding his own
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Moran did not stop there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is clearly some hemorrhaging going on within the
Democratic Party, within the Congress as whole and particularly
within the country. And that hemorrhaging _ he's got to stanch that
flow. I'm just not creative enough to think of a way other than
resignation that would do that. But maybe he can.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for the maxim that politicians live by the polls _ or
the advice of their handlers. Instead of behaving like weather
vanes, some lawmakers seem more like weather forecasters these
days.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of explanations for why Democrats are
disinclined to follow a partisan script. For one thing, they want
to inoculate themselves. If they criticize Clinton now, they will
not appear out of step if and when public opinion turns against
him. In addition, many Democratic lawmakers have told advisers that
they feel personally betrayed by his assurances that he did not
have an affair, and there has never been a reservoir of loyalty for
Clinton on Capitol Hill, where many Democrats think he has long put
his interests before theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians are used to thinking about the worst-case
scenario,'' said Richard Fenno, a professor of political science at
the University of Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   Another explanation is that many politicians are as or more
likely to listen to _ and trust _ their friends, colleagues and
constituents back home as they are the cold, gray statistics. Some
Democrats in tight races this November are blaming Clinton for
their troubles when the reality is that they would have been in
tight races even if no one had heard of Monica Lewinsky. But those
politicians are stoking fears among their colleagues that the
scandal is causing massive electoral reverberations.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly striking is the roster of lawmakers in Clinton's
own party _ notably senators _ who have not hesitated to publicly
lambaste him. They include Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer
of California; Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York; Joseph
Lieberman of Connecticut; Bob Kerrey of Nebraska; Joseph Biden of
Delaware; Bob Graham of Florida, Ernest Hollings of South Carolina
and John Breaux of Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans are also neglecting advice from strategists
that they keep their focus on the issues, and let Democrats
self-destruct on their own. Instead, many lawmakers are encouraging
talk about impeachment, despite surveys showing that most people do
not want Clinton to be impeached or forced from office. But there
is also a sense among Republicans that the political dynamics are
so unsettled that there could be a backlash against the party if
members of the House Judiciary Committee release a videotape of
Clinton's grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   It could be, too, that politicians are not just driven by polls
or by political calculations. Perhaps some should be given credit
for speaking out harshly against the president for reasons of
personal conscience.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Democratic Party is struggling to calm its rattled
candidates. Wednesday, the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee released a survey it commissioned to show that despite
the scandal, Democrats are maintaining leads in 10 of the most
competitive House races.
</P>
<P>
   ``What these numbers tell us is that there's no need to panic,''
said Dan Sallick, a spokesman for the committee.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Mellman learned, many Democrats on Capitol Hill seem
past the point of panic.

 &HT;    Karan's collection now up to Wall Street
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Keep an eye out for how well _ or how poorly _ Donna
Karan's company fares on the New York Stock Exchange over the next
few days. The spring/summer '99 preview she staged in her showroom
Wednesday night could have strong influence over the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Donna Karan that once sold in the $30 range but now
trade for about $7 or $8 might soar because of the impression her
collection made on those who know her clothes' marketability. Or
those shares might plummet further because those there to take
stock of the collection might spread the word about what a hard
sell it'll be.
</P>
<P>
   Convincing women to buy into the color palette Karan selected
won't be hard. Her sweaters, skirts, jackets, dresses and suits
came in the prettiest hues of pink, yellow, green, lavender and
gray that anyone could imagine. It's the sweaters, skirts, jackets,
dresses and suits themselves that could prove problematic at
retail.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine Karan _ whose claim to fame has always been
the simplicity and wearability of her designs _ devising a
collection wrought with as much complexity as the one she'll offer
next season.
</P>
<P>
   The twisted pleats on her double-layered taffeta skirts looked
lovely. But those pleats were gathered impractically at the ankle,
and the skirts' elasticized waistbands somehow made her
stick-figure models look bulbous.
</P>
<P>
   Karan showed ``panel'' dresses made of yards of
color-coordinated, sheer organza. And it was gorgeous the way she
gathered, bunched and cinched the layers of fabric at the hip, the
shoulder, the buttock and the breast. But as one loudmouthed
detractor bellowed after the show, ``Try to imagine (them) hanging
on a (retail) rack!''
</P>
<P>
   Items that looked irresistible at any price included the
knee-length, faux wrap skirts, the confidently tailored blazers and
the amusingly sassy tube tops Karan made out of tropical weight
wool. The gauzy cashmere sweaters and tank tops she showed with
cropped pants, floor-sweeping skirts and evening gowns looked great
_ on the models _ too. But when Karan emerged from backstage to
take her post-show bow in the same, layered cashmere sweater look,
it gave a discouraging glimpse at how unflattering it is on an
average-size woman.
</P>
<P>
   What looks ``Honey, where'd you get that?'' good on one woman
can look horrendous on the next. With that in mind, BCBG designer
Max Azria admitted Wednesday that the unconventionally styled
spring/summer '99 collection he presented had to be taken with a
grain of salt. Azria showed beaded mesh tank tops worn over V-neck
cashmere cardigans and shiny silk Capri pants over flared and
beaded mesh pants that extended to the toes.
</P>
<P>
   Azria chose colors (pale pinks, lavenders, blues and grays) more
attuned to the earlier days of spring, and his beading resembled
melted water dripping from icicles.

<P>
   ATLANTA -- A former FBI agent said Wednesday he will not
willingly turn over to federal officials documents he retrieved
from James Earl Ray's car 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Former Agent Donald Wilson said he met for two hours Wednesday
near his suburban Chicago home with Barry Kowalski, who is heading
the Justice Department's newly reopened investigation into the
April 4, 1968, assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in
Memphis. But, Wilson said, he declined to turn over the documents
after discovering that a federal investigator had him under
surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a private citizen,'' Wilson said. ``I'm not a criminal.
Who authorizes the surveillance of a private citizen?''
</P>
<P>
   Later Wednesday evening, Wilson said, Kowalski called to tell
him that he had obtained a search warrant from a judge in Chicago
and that federal agents would retrieve the evidence from Wilson's
bank vault today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to turn it over,'' Wilson said. ``They want to
destroy it. This is not an unbiased investigation. He says it's the
property of the U.S. government. I dispute that.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson in March said he had retrieved two scraps of paper from
Ray's abandoned white Ford Mustang when he was an FBI agent
stationed in Atlanta in April 1968. Both papers contain the word
``Raul.'' Ray, who died in April while serving a 99-year sentence,
maintained he had been set up by a smuggler he only knew as
``Raoul.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, with the FBI for 10 years, said he had not turned over
the evidence earlier because he did not trust the integrity of the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Attorney General Janet Reno authorized a limited
investigation into Wilson's allegations and into claims by a former
Memphis restaurant owner that a mob boss paid him $100,000 to hire
an assassin.

BOARD GIVES POLICE CONTROL OF SCHOOL SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a vociferous and emotional debate among
concerned parents, teachers and community leaders, the Board of
Education voted unanimously Wednesday night to transfer control of
security in the city's public schools to the Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-0 vote came after more than two dozen speakers implored
board members not to turn security over to police, saying it would
create a prisonlike atmosphere in the schools. Under the plan, to
begin no later than Dec. 31, the training, recruiting and managing
of the Division of School Safety's 3,200 officers will be turned
over to the Police Department, but the officers will not carry
guns. Uniformed and armed officers will continue to patrol 128 of
the city's 1,100 schools.
</P>
<P>
   Objections to the plan were particularly emphasized by black
leaders, who said black children already have strained relations
with police, which was underscored by clashes at a youth rally in
Harlem earlier this month. The Rev. Al Sharpton said he was
concerned about what he said was a lack of understanding of youth
culture among police officers, particularly white officers.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled how some officers who marched on City Hall on Sept.
16, 1992, shouted racial epithets at then-Mayor David Dinkins
because he wanted to establish the Civilian Complaint Review Board.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a school system where the overwhelming majority of the
students are from the Latino and African-American community,'' he
said, ``you cannot divorce what happened on Sept. 16, 1992, from
Sept. 16, 1998, because some of the same people and attitudes
exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Other opponents said a police presence would interfere with the
learning atmosphere for the system's 1.1 million schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has repeatedly dismissed those arguments,
contending that the move was necessary to eradicate a Board of
Education unit whose officers and officials have been involved in
school crimes and corruption over the years. The issue played
heavily in the departure of Ramon Cortines as schools chancellor in
October 1995. Giuliani and Cortines, who opposed police control of
school safety, became engaged in a bitter debate over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after years of behind-the-scenes work, the current
chancellor, Rudy Crew _ who has maintained all along that he
opposes police control of the schools _ and Giuliani have hammered
out a compromise plan in which the Police Department is in charge
but does not increase its personnel in the schools.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking publicly for the first time on the issue Wednesday,
Crew said the measure would maintain safety for children and staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as that is the guidepost to any and all collaborative
efforts, then I think it's a winner,'' he said before the Board of
Education meeting. ``Early on, the tone of this, the mechanism for
this, was police being in schools. The police being the ones who
supervise. I don't believe in that. I don't believe that is the way
to go. These are educational institutions. They're not penal
institutions. There is no need for that kind of thrust.''
</P>
<P>
   Crew said he would reserve the right to veto the number of
officers assigned to a school. But details of exactly how the plan
will work were left intentionally vague by Crew, who said that
people needed room to work within the framework of their own
relationships. For example, the question of who would settle
student disputes, police or school principals, was left open,
though there is an appeals procedure in place if serious
disagreements arise. He said most decisions would be made case by
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``There still is going to be a fair amount of ambiguity about
this,'' Crew said. ``I think there is going to need to be further
clarification of it.'' Crew offhandedly criticized the current
safety program, saying that when the new plan is in place, parents
``will see a clear, more structured approach to the notion of
school safety.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has lacked some of the technical expertise that comes with
the training of a police officer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The school system and the Police Department will continue to
maintain separate incident reports. The Police Department will
conduct background checks of the safety officers to determine
whether a person meets the standard to continue in the ranks, Crew
said.

TOP IRAQIS AFFIRM THREAT TO END ARMS CHECKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Iraq's ruling council Wednesday endorsed a
threat to end all cooperation with United Nations arms inspectors
if the Security Council did not restore regular reviews of its
sanctions against the country.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the U.N. Special Commission here said the
inspectors at the commission's Baghdad headquarters and other staff
members based in Iraq had not heard the announcement until midnight
Iraqi time and would not know until morning whether there would be
any immediate effect on their work.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast announcement followed a meeting of the
Revolutionary Command Council, over which President Saddam Hussein
normally presides. It said the council had endorsed a decision by
the Iraqi parliament Monday to end cooperation. The legislature is
often used to float government policy ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam's council labeled ``pressure and blackmail'' a unanimous
Security Council resolution last week that suspended regular
sanctions reviews, effectively keeping Iraq under an indefinite
embargo.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council action, which diplomats said would not be
reversed, was a reaction to Iraq's decision Aug. 5 to end on-site
inspections by U.N. teams, leaving only a circumscribed remote
monitoring system in place.
</P>
<P>
   There was no indication in today's announcement what would
happen to long-term monitoring by the Special Commission, which was
to have been continued even after sanctions were lifted.
</P>
<P>
   To end the embargo, which has cost Iraq billions of dollars in
lost oil sales since 1990, when Iraq invaded Kuwait, inspectors
have to report to the Security Council that all Iraqi biological,
chemical and nuclear weapons and certain missile systems have been
destroyed and cannot be rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolutionary Command Council also criticized Secretary
General Kofi Annan on Wednesday, echoing an official's charges
Tuesday that Annan was not honoring the agreement he made with the
Iraqis in February. Annan has said the Iraqis are in violation of
that accord, in which they promised full access to weapons
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has chosen to interpret the agreement as a promise that
sanctions would be lifted if Baghdad allowed inspectors to tour
off-limits presidential properties, as it did in the spring. Since
then, Iraq has largely refused to answer outstanding questions or
provide documents sought by the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis are also demanding a comprehensive review of their
relations with the United Nations. Wednesday, Peter Burleigh, the
U.S. representative, said that if such an evaluation took place,
the United States would not limit the review to weapons questions
but would go back to unmet demands that Iraq turn over or account
for missing Kuwaitis, return stolen Kuwaiti property and show
improvement in its human rights record.

WITH A SHOUT HEARD ROUND THE NATION, MEXICO CELEBRATES
INDEPENDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (smw) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEQUISQUIAPAN, Mexico _ Jose Antonio Mejia, who at 27 may be
Mexico's youngest mayor and is still unaccustomed to public
speaking, was feeling panic Tuesday night as the time drew near for
him to preside over his first Independence Day celebration.
</P>
<P>
   As two bemedaled army generals and other local dignitaries lined
up to greet Mejia at the town hall, he fingered his tie nervously.
As eager but tenuously trained teen-age trumpeters intoned the
national anthem, Mejia passed his palms across his suit jacket,
wiping away sweat.
</P>
<P>
   But despite his trepidation, when his moment came to stand
before thousands of people in the plaza of this colonial town,
Mejia met his obligations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viva Mexico!'' he shouted in an unquavering voice at 11 p.m.
as festoons of burning phosphorus set the facade of Tequisquiapan's
church ablaze in light.
</P>
<P>
   At the same hour, mayors in the 2,392 municipalities all across
Mexico presided over their own ceremonies. In the capital,
President Ernesto Zedillo shouted the same slogan from the balcony
of the National Palace as 2 million revelers packed the Zocalo, the
central plaza, and its environs. Millions of others watched the
nationwide broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Mexico endures a turbulent political transition, two
small insurgencies, an epidemic of violent crime and the global
financial crisis, it remains a largely stable country, united by
tight families and built on the bedrock of traditions. One of the
most deeply felt is the September celebration of the beginning of
the Independence War against Spain in 1810.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those public ceremonies that provide an anchor
for Mexicans after 20 years of crisis and rapid change,'' said
Federico Estevez, a political scientist.
</P>
<P>
   In a popular history of Mexico published last year, the writer
Enrique Krauze described how Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, a brilliant
but somewhat eccentric parish priest in the central town of
Dolores, launched the 1810 uprising: ``On the morning of Sept. 16
he rang the cathedral bell to summon his Indian parishioners into
the church square of Dolores and delivered his famous cry: `Death
to the Spaniards! Long live the Virgin of Guadalupe!'''
</P>
<P>
   After the army of Hidalgo, largely made up of Indians, swept
through central Mexico, razing haciendas and killing Spaniards, he
was captured, shot and beheaded in Chihuahua in 1811, and Spanish
loyalists put his head on display until Mexico won its independence
in 1821.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo's followers began re-enacting his cry, or grito, even
before the Independence War ended. Over the course of the 19th
century, it evolved into Mexico's most important patriotic
ceremony, but according to Krauze, historians disagree about what,
exactly, Hidaldgo said in his first grito.
</P>
<P>
   That historical ambiguity has allowed for a flexible tradition.
All presidents and mayors who preside over the September ceremony
shout ``Viva Mexico!'' But beyond that, many add and subtract
historical heroes and political concepts, fine-tuning the moment to
fit their own political needs.
</P>
<P>
   President Jose Lopez Portillo, in his last grito in 1982, two
weeks after he nationalized Mexico's banks, added the phrase ``Long
live the nationalization of the banks!'' That was a short-lived
innovation, since President Carlos Salinas reprivatized the banks
after taking office in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas, for his part, added the phrase ``Long live Emiliano
Zapata,'' thereby broadening the grito's historical focus from the
19th-century independence struggle to the 20th-century revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo, in his first grito in September 1995, added the phrase
``Long live democracy!''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night he said, ``Mexicans, long live our
independence, long live our sovereignty, long live democracy and
long live the unity of all Mexicans. Viva Mexico!''
</P>
<P>
   The Mexico City newspaper Reforma recently asked athletes,
artists, politicians and other famous Mexicans what they would
shout if they could preside over this year's ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Many offered high-minded slogans like the one proposed by
Santiago Creel, an opposition congressman: ``Long live
understanding among all Mexicans!''
</P>
<P>
   Other suggestions were more free-wheeling. Andres Bustamante, a
comedian, said he would shout, ``Fellow citizens, will the person
who has stolen the flag please return it so that the ceremony can
continue?''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Monsivais, a prominent intellectual, suggested, ``Long
live what's left of Mexico!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Long live the blues,'' proposed Betsy Pecanins, a popular
singer. Most, however, urged that there be no changes at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditions are important,'' said author Jorge Castaneda.
``Better not disturb them.''
</P>
<P>
   That was, of course, the approach favored by Mejia as he
prepared to preside over the grito in this town of cobblestoned
streets and 75,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before townspeople began to gather in the Tequisquiapan
plaza, Mejia was in his office, reviewing his script and speaking
with a visitor.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled that, as a youth, he would walk hand in hand with
his father to the plaza an hour before midnight each year on Sept.
15.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd get more nervous than the mayor himself when I'd see the
throngs of people,'' Mejia said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Panic is natural for anybody that's not used to speaking to
large crowds,'' he added, seeming to reflect on his own churning
stomach.
</P>
<P>
   But after Mejia marched into the plaza behind a drum and bugle
corps to the salutes of town policemen and with well-wishers
calling out to him from balconies and rooftops, he climbed the
stairs of the central bandstand without hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long live the heroes who gave us fatherland and liberty!'' he
shouted. ``Viva Miguel Hidalgo! Viva Ignacio Allende! Viva Jose
Maria Morelos! Viva Aldama! Viva Dona Josefa Ortiz de Dominguez!
Viva Mexico's independence! Viva Mexico! Viva Mexico! Viva
Mexico!''
</P>
<P>
   And as fireworks engulfed the Tequisquiapan plaza and mariachi
singers burst into song, Mejia smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was great,'' he whispered. ``What a surge of emotion!''

COMMENTARY: EXEMPLAR OF A TOO-HARD, TOO-FAST, TOO-SHORT LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JANE GROSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ Mike Miller lounged on a headstone at St.
Peter's Cemetery, taking a cigarette break and watching from a
distance as Catina Newmaster _ prostitute, drug addict, mother of
five and murder victim _ was laid to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Miller had dug Ms. Newmaster's grave Tuesday and put up the tent
that grieving relatives gathered under on this muggy Wednesday
morning, wailing in sorrow and dropping flowers on the ornate pink
coffin.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Newmaster, 25, had lived too hard and died too young, the
gravedigger said. And Miller ought to know, since he had long
tended bar on the notorious 500 block of Main Street, where
prostitutes supported their drug habits by turning tricks for $20,
just blocks from the verdant campus of Vassar College.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he had known Ms. Newmaster from his days at
Smokey's, a corner bar marked only by the neon beer advertisements
and a ``No Loitering'' sign. He also knew some of the other
prostitutes who law enforcement officials say were killed and then
hidden by Kendall Francois, a burly, unemployed school aide who is
charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody wrote about what she was and what she did,'' Miller
said of Ms. Newmaster, in an impromptu eulogy. ``But everyone has a
good side. I'm sure she was a good mother in her own way.''
</P>
<P>
   A grand jury is currently hearing evidence against Francois,
while state forensic experts continue to hunt for evidence in his
home on Fulton Avenue, where eight bodies have been found. Burials
of the victims were delayed for a week so that independent
autopsies could be conducted by the state's Capital Defender
Office, which handles cases that might result in the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Newmaster was the first to be buried, after a Roman Catholic
Mass closed to curiosity seekers and reporters. A photograph of the
young woman, from the shoulders up as in a high school yearbook,
stood atop the coffin, along with a crayoned ``I love you'' from
her children.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Newmaster's mother, Barbara Perry, was haggard and
disfigured with grief. She softly keened, ``Oh, my daughter; oh, my
daughter'' as she was led into the church by family members.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Newmaster, 25, was the last of the prostitutes reported
missing, on Aug. 25, and the first removed from the Fulton Avenue
house Sept. 2. There was no doubt about the identification; family
members immediately recognized tattoos on her right hip and right
arm and a nose ring.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ms. Newmaster, some of her mourners wore signs of their
tenuous lives. A few were poorly dressed, unkempt, tattooed,
pierced. They had an unhealthy pallor, particularly for the end of
summer. Their automobiles, too, had seen better days, belching
black exhaust during the 30-car procession to the graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller watched them with empathy since he, too, had spent
time on the streets. ``I used to drink and did the drug thing for a
while,'' he said. ``Not that I'm bragging. But it's one big circle,
and some people can't get out.''
</P>
<P>
   He gestured toward a grave a few rows from Ms. Newmaster's. His
brother-in-law was buried there, Miller said, dead at 30 from an
overdose. Several of the mourners waved or walked over to chat with
him, as he leaned against the headstone of Richard E. Perkins,
1923-1982, a decorated veteran. ``These people don't have a way
out,'' Miller, who is 42, continued. ``They have no knowledge or
education and they've got to survive. They're all nice people. They
just got tied up in a hard life.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, like many of the relatives of the dead prostitutes,
doubted that police were as vigorous as they could have been in
investigating the missing women. ``If it was housewives, or other
people respected in the community,'' he said, it would have been
different.
</P>
<P>
   During the two years when the prostitutes were disappearing,
many streetwalkers near Smokey's kept a low profile, ``only doing
business with people they really knew,'' Miller said. Now, with
Francois jailed without bail, more women ``are out and about,
circulating again.''
</P>
<P>
   Their world is a few blocks of boarded-up buildings, botanicas,
store-front churches, and filling stations selling unbranded gas.
Nearly every doorway has an unheeded sign reading, ``No loitering,
trespass or hanging out.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he wished the remaining prostitutes a transformation
similar to his own. His job as a gravedigger, although hardly a
glamour career, is ``stable and a lot safer'' than Smokey's. He has
the deep tan and strong arms of a man who works outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to get away from that life,'' he said. ``But most
people, what are they going to do? Get a job at McDonald's for $6
an hour and no benefits? The street for them is like you going to
the office.''

THOMAS MURPHY, 91, LEADER OF N.Y. NEWSPAPER GUILD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thomas J. Murphy, who led the Newspaper Guild of New
York for 22 years, including during the bitter 114-day strike of
1962-63, died Sept. 16 at Regency Park Nursing Home in Hazlet, N.J.
He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy was widely respected as a tough and savvy negotiator when
he headed the Guild from 1948 to 1970, helping its members obtain
pensions for the first time, as well as some of the highest
newspaper salaries in the country.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the Guild, he played an instrumental role in turning
New York City's 10 newspaper unions into a cohesive force _
unofficially called ``the blood brotherhood'' _ that usually forged
common positions and honored one another's picket lines.
</P>
<P>
   Although Murphy's title was executive vice president, he was the
unchallenged No. 1 official in the New York Guild at a time when
the city still had 13 newspapers, and the Guild represented more
than 6,000 reporters, copy editors, and advertising and circulation
workers at The New York Times, The World Journal Tribune and other
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What stood out was his ability to operate in a bargaining
relationship with multiple unions and multiple employers when
you're bargaining with not just the employers but your fellow
unionists,'' said Theodore Kheel, the veteran labor negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy headed the Guild when New York's newspaper unions had
considerably more leverage; in that pre-computer era, unions were
far more effective in shutting down newspapers when they went on
strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a powerful union leader,'' said Barry Lipton, the
current president of the Newspaper Guild of New York. ``They could
shut down newspapers in those days, so they could very often get
what they wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy came from a generation in which labor leaders were
crustier and blunter, and he had his share of enemies. Often when
his opponents asked hostile questions, he threw them off track by
giving long-winded answers that he broke down into part 1(a) and
1(b), all part of an effort to lose his listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy was credited with maximizing the Guild's bargaining power
by insisting throughout the 1950s that its contracts expire at the
end of October, a few days before Election Day. He recognized that
newspaper publishers, eager to avoid a strike in the important days
before Election Day, might be more conciliatory at the bargaining
table when there was a late-October deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good trade unionist,'' said Bertram Powers, the
longtime president of the typographers union in New York. ``He was
way ahead of his contemporaries.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1940s, Murphy was in the thick of the battles between
pro-communists and anti-communists within the Guild. His
anti-communist faction emerged triumphant in the late 1940s, and he
played a major role _ one that still angers some aging Guild
members _ in ousting officials and members regarded as too far to
the left.
</P>
<P>
   Lipton said that when Murphy was interviewed recently as part of
an oral history of the union, Murphy said that purging communists
was one of his major accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy often served as the effective leader of the coalition of
10 newspaper unions, known officially as the Allied Printing Trades
Council. But in the 1960s, Powers eclipsed Murphy largely because
the typographers had a far greater greater ability to shut down the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Joseph Murphy was born in Manhattan on Sept. 24, 1906,
the son of Thomas Francis Murphy and Elizabeth McCollough Murphy.
His father died when he was 3 years old, and as a boy he took odd
jobs in grocery stores to help support his mother and sister.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy never finished high school, and, according to family
members, took a job working for the circulation department of The
New York Times right after dropping out of school.
</P>
<P>
   He became active in the Newspaper Guild in the late 1930s, and
in the early 1940s he served as a negotiator. In 1943, he became
the first paid business agent of the New York Guild and from 1945
to 1947, he was its secretary-treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy married Elizabeth Clark on July 14, 1945, and they raised
two children in Queens. She died in 1969, and, his children said,
Murphy married again in 1975 to Nancy O'Sullivan, who died a decade
later.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a daughter, Nancy Back of Staten Island; a
son, Joseph Murphy of Middlesex, England, and three grandchildren.

NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC: PLAYING IT SAFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Season openers in the music world can be declarations
of intent, bearers of subliminal messages or simple hellos. Applied
to Wednesday night's New York Philharmonic concert, the first two
options fit less well than the third.
</P>
<P>
   But who knows? If this all-Beethoven program at Avery Fisher
Hall welcomed old friends pure and simple, it also offered tacit
reassurance to faithful listeners that the obvious would not be
neglected. Certainly, marketers of symphony concerts have no better
chum than the great man himself; for when success is in doubt, one
Beethoven symphony will go a long way toward filling seats, and
adding on the ``Fidelio'' Overture will just about guarantee it.
</P>
<P>
   Another old friend Wednesday night was Isaac Stern. Stern, well
into his 70s, had originally planned to play the Violin Concerto
but ultimately thought better of it and came with gentler
Beethoven, the two Romances.
</P>
<P>
   The concert, conducted by the Philharmonic's music director,
Kurt Masur, and sandwiched in between various festivities for
subscribers, also began the orchestra's quick September dash
through all of the Beethoven symphonies: five programs, each
repeated at least twice, and running until the beginning of
October. Thereafter the orchestra travels to Cologne, Germany, for
a two-week residency. Nothing new there either: three
all-Tchaikovsky programs and more Beethoven.
</P>
<P>
   It took only a few moments to remind listeners that the New York
Philharmonic can do anything a good conductor wants it to. Masur's
wish seemed to be Beethoven that was tough as nails: with blunt
metallic sound arranged with great energy and, when not overly
pushed, great accuracy. One had only to listen to the finale of the
First Symphony whizzing by with such easy delicacy to realize how
good these players can be.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Fidelio'' music and much of the rest of the symphony,
one heard musicians hard at work but evidently not having a very
good time. Every hint of sensuousness was stripped away, leaving
phrases that, instead of fading into silence, cut off like light
switches. The overture almost snarled: not the kind of music to
meet in a dark alley.
</P>
<P>
   It was best to listen to Stern with one ear in the past. He has
been an exemplary musician at the violin, always distancing himself
from the grandiloquent showoffs and the rug-chewing romantics of
his trade. In him is a deep and and dignified respect for style,
and one worked hard to remember that Wednesday night. The two
Romances are modest pieces, but Stern really doesn't have the
physical control to play them securely or with any real thrust. The
F-Major piece, thankfully, went much better than the first in
G-Major. There was an encore of three Fritz Kreisler waltzes.
</P>
<P>
   The vital question, at least on the lips of some, is, Why
another Beethoven cycle? Masur projects these pieces with an
unassailable rectitude, but here he added nothing to our already
enormous pool of experience. Sensibly rationed, the Beethoven
symphonies have an outside chance of retaining at least some of
their original wildness, exuberance and menace. Repeated endlessly,
they are tamed into innocuousness, killed with kindness. Wolf
becomes lapdog.
</P>
<P>
   Programming like this hardly does the Philharmonic's subscribers
any good either. Long since trained to believe that good classical
music is what they already know, they are soothed that much more.
First-week programs in San Francisco and Los Angeles virtually jump
with life: Gershwin, Berg, lots of Americana, a new piece by
Esa-Pekka Salonen.
</P>
<P>
   Things get more interesting at the Philharmonic later in the
month, with several new, newer and more out-of-the-way pieces. They
will be conducted not by Masur but by people like Simone Young,
Leonard Slatkin and Colin Davis. So maybe beneath the hellos of
this opening concert, there was a message clearer than we thought.
</P>
<P>
   Here are two possibilities, and both ask forgiveness for their
cynicism:
</P>
<P>
   Dear subscriber, goes the first. I know we have some hot and
spicy food coming that is going to worry a lot of you, so here is a
nice box of chocolates in advance.
</P>
<P>
   The second is similar: Don't get mad when we play all that music
you don't know. Think how nice we were with those Beethoven
symphonies.

ENDORSEMENTS OF PATAKI UPSTAGE VALLONE UPSTATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ A day after winning the Democratic gubernatorial
primary, Peter Vallone took a victory lap of New York on Wednesday
to reintroduce himself to upstate voters, but he was upstaged when
Buffalo's Democratic mayor endorsed Gov. George Pataki for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone, who remains little known upstate despite months of
campaigning, pointedly made his first stops in Buffalo and in
Albany, in search of a lift from his easy win in Tuesday's primary.
And he focused on the stubbornly weak upstate economy, blaming
Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fighting for last place in job creation,'' he said at a
news conference with local officials at Buffalo International
Airport. ``There's no excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   But less than two hours after Vallone's campaign plane took off,
Pataki's touched down, and the Republican governor accepted the
embrace of Anthony Masiello, mayor of the state's second-largest
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lay aside all partisanship,'' Masiello declared at a news
conference at a marina on the Niagara Canal. ``I focus instead on
one simple question: what is best for Buffalo, New York?''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki boasted that the Democratic mayors of Niagara Falls,
Utica and Oneida had already supported him. Of Masiello, he said,
``the mayor has shown the courage to cross party lines because our
policies are right for Buffalo and right for this state.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Buffalo Democrats charged that Masiello acted purely in
hope of winning more state aid for his economically distressed
city. Democrats worry that a tide of defections like Masiello's
could undermine their candidate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the primary, Vallone defeated his closest competitor, Lt.
Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross, by a 5-to-2 margin. But Wednesday, Ms.
McCaughey Ross pledged to continue running through November as the
Liberal Party nominee, a stance that has infuriated many Democrats,
who contend that all she will accomplish is to divide the
anti-Pataki vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect the leaders of the Democratic Party tremendously and
I look forward to working with them in the future,'' Ms. McCaughey
Ross said Wednesday in Manhattan. ``But I've given my word to the
Liberal Party, and I feel it's very important for me to keep my
word.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Party chairman Raymond Harding filed a complaint
Wednesday with the state Board of Elections, charging that efforts
by Democrats to persuade Ms. McCaughey Ross to drop out of the race
amounted to threats and coercion. He cited the comments of state
Democratic chairwoman Judith Hope, who said Tuesday night that if
the lieutenant governor remained in the race, ``it will get very
ugly and will turn out to be a very unpleasant experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallone said: ``I have no advice for Betsy. She's got to do
whatever she does on her own.''
</P>
<P>
   As they kicked off the campaign for the general election, the
largest share of attention belonged to Pataki and Vallone.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's waltz around the state was clearly intended to
overshadow Vallone, the speaker of the New York City Council. After
the Masiello endorsement, the governor and the Republican nominee
for lieutenant governor, Mary Donohue, flew to Rochester and
Binghamton for enthusiastic rallies.
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki campaign has begun labeling Vallone, who is usually
seen as a moderate, as a liberal who has raised taxes. Aides to the
governor said Pataki's first advertisement attacking the Democrat
would probably be broadcast this week.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone, too, intends to air new advertisements this week, but
starts the campaign with about $1 million to the governor's $12
million.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone's victory over three rivals Tuesday gave him a new
degree of celebrity after a primary that drew little interest. When
he appeared here a week ago to receive the endorsement of Erie
County Executive Dennis Gorski, just three reporters turned up and
no television cameras. Wednesday, there were more than a dozen
reporters and four television cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone challenged Pataki to debates, repeatedly taunting the
governor about the paid speeches he has made around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that you've made speeches in California, in Iowa, in
New Hampshire and in a couple of other states,'' he said. ``I
challenge you, Governor, to debate right here in New York state.
Let's start in Buffalo.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the challenge, Pataki responded, ``I am very proud
of our record, and I look forward to a spirited campaign, including
debating all the issues.'' But he would not commit to televised
debates, or to a one-on-one confrontation with Vallone.

CLINTON'S PUSH TO CALM FINANCIAL TURMOIL MEETS OBSTACLES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to rewrite 3rd, 4th, 5th grafs)  (mk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's push to quell the global
financial turmoil ran into several obstacles Wednesday, as Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, testified that the world's
big economies had no plans for a coordinated interest-rate
reduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can safely say at the moment there is no endeavor to
coordinate interest-rate cuts,'' Greenspan told the House Banking
Committee, but he again hinted that the global crisis could lead
the Federal Reserve to cut domestic rates. ``Deflationary forces
are continuing to emerge'' in much of the rest of the world, he
said, and they are moving toward the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rubin, the treasury secretary, indicated Wednesday that
Brazil was the main focus of American concern in Latin America. But
in another setback to coordinated action, negotiations involving
Brazil, the International Monetary Fund and the major industrial
nations over a multibillion-dollar rescue package hit political
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian officials appear hesitant to seek aid before their
country's presidential election in two weeks, especially because a
condition for the help would be agreeing to unpopular budget cuts,
people involved in the negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the political obstacles to assembling a rescue
package for Brazil and the obvious discord within the Group of
Seven industrial nations regarding a global interest-rate cut
suggest that Clinton's agenda will be extremely difficult to enact.
</P>
<P>
   American investors had been hopeful that Clinton's call on
Monday for a concerted push to contain the fast-spreading global
crisis would lead to quick action to shore up the embattled
economies of Latin America. Clinton's words, they hoped, would spur
central banks to put aside their traditional fixation on inflation
and cut rates to promote growth.
</P>
<P>
   But Germany's powerful central bank, the Bundesbank, signaled
Tuesday that it continued to see inflation as a threat in Europe,
and officials from other nations have also been playing down the
possibility of quick action on rates or any other response to the
world's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, however, Greenspan said there was evidence
that the robust pace of growth was slowing and that investors were
becoming more nervous about how the global crisis was affecting the
domestic financial system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that despite the still very solid American economy
as of now, there are really the first signs of erosion at the
edges, especially in manufacturing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve will next meet to consider interest-rate
policy on Sept. 29, and despite Greenspan's hints that a rate cut
could be considered, it is by no means clear that the Fed's other
members are ready to act.
</P>
<P>
   William Poole, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St.
Louis, said Wednesday that although the Fed was under pressure to
help other economies and the world financial system, it had to stay
focused on restraining inflation in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   While he did not rule out supporting a rate cut, Poole, one of
the Fed's most ardent inflation fighters, said that an ``attempt to
pursue other objectives that in fact damaged pursuit of price
stability in the United States would only add to world financial
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments this week marked the first time that he had
spelled out a plan of action, and Wednesday, at a news conference,
he told reporters that fighting the financial crisis was ``the most
important subject now facing the world community.'' He argued that
``my objectives were embraced by the leaders, the financial
leaders, of the largest industrial countries in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some of his closest aides conceded in private that his call
for action came late, and that the problems of economic contagion
are now far more complicated than they were in early August, when
he first considered giving the speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should have done this months ago,'' one of his closest
advisers said Wednesday, acknowledging that the plan would be even
more difficult to achieve when the president is fending off calls
for resignation, impeachment or censure.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   American officials are clearly worried about the fallout if
Brazil, one of America's largest trading partners, is hit full
force by the economic contagion caused by the flight of investors
from emerging markets worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, testifying Wednesday, was cautious discussing Brazil,
saying that it ``is obviously enormously important to this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been very focused on this, actually,'' he said, ``for
quite some time, and particularly over the course of the past week.
I think it is probably premature to comment on specifics other than
to assure you that this has been the subject of intense focus
through last week, the weekend, and up to the current moment.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Brazilian caution before a presidential election,
the nation's problems are fed by the fear of a renewed attack on
the currency as investors continue to flee emerging markets and
worries that the IMF's emergency reserves must be carefully
conserved.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian officials say they have not asked the IMF for direct
help. But on Tuesday night, the finance minister, Pedro Malan, said
that his government was talking to the IMF and the Group of Seven
countries about ways to bolster the confidence of investors. He
hinted that the IMF would put together a line of credit, probably
more than $25 billion, that Brazil and its neighbors could draw on
to defend their currencies and pay their international debts.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday morning, hours after President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso talked to Clinton by telephone in a discussion that neither
government described in detail, Malan backed away. ``It is not for
Brazil to speak for the IMF or any G-7 country or make comments on
the terms, volumes and conditions upon which international
cooperation could or would be made available to countries if the
need arises,'' he said. Other officials said that there had not
been any discussion of the size of the package.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was out ahead of himself,'' one person close to the
negotiations said, insisting on anonymity, ``but he wasn't entirely
blowing smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Malan, much like officials in Thailand and Korea late last year,
may have been dangling the possibility of international help to
encourage the recent run-up in the Brazilian stock market _ which
could help stave off the need for help. He did not discuss the
conditions that Brazil would have to meet in return for the
commitment of backup financing because they are likely to create
trouble for Cardoso as his re-election campaign enters its final
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF, officials say, would insist that Brazil cut its huge
budget deficit, which currently runs about 7 percent of the
country's gross domestic product. That would mean pushing cuts in
social programs or military spending through a notoriously
undisciplined Congress, a task that the government would prefer to
tackle after the elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very, very slow mating dance,'' said an official
involved in the discussions. ``The Brazilians don't want to
acknowledge that they need help, but they also don't want to risk a
meltdown of their economy in the next few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Putting together a rescue package would almost certainly involve
committing to use the last $15 billion left in the IMF's
``emergency fuel tank,'' a fund called the general agreement to
borrow. It is essentially a loan from the world's major economies,
which used the same fund in July in a failed effort to prop up
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has used only $4.8 billion of the money it was promised,
but billions more are committed to Moscow should it meet the IMF's
conditions of collecting more taxes and keeping the money supply
under control. So far, the new Russian government, appointed just
days ago, appears to be moving in the opposite direction.

CHINESE OPPOSITION PARTY APPLIES TO REGISTER LOCAL BRANCHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Dissidents in three parts of China have applied to the
government in the last two weeks to register local branches of an
opposition organization, the China Democratic Party, human rights
groups and the dissidents said.
</P>
<P>
   The dissidents said they were surprised when the idea was not
rejected outright and even more surprised when, in two provinces,
they were told the requirements to register an organization: a list
of at least 50 members with designated leaders, a headquarters and
a $6,200 fee.
</P>
<P>
   Three months ago a similar application on behalf of the China
Democratic Party was flatly rejected in Zhejiang Province, and the
applicants were imprisoned or placed under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response was very different between June and September,
and we think our situation is a bit better,'' said Wang Youcai, a
dissident whose application in June led to a one-month prison term.
``At this stage we're trying to fulfill the conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as dissident groups optimistically spied a new trend, the
central government's information office sought to play down the
reports, saying its investigations had found that, in one province
at least no application had been received and accusing the group in
Hong Kong that publicized the applications, the Information Center
for Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China, of trying to
``mislead public opinion with its repeated lies.''
</P>
<P>
   China experts have found the episode perplexing, not sure
whether it represents a sign of liberalization, a public relations
stunt or even whether it occurred at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very curious,'' said Andrew Nathan, a political scientist
at Columbia University. ``I doubt that the current regime would
allow a political party to form. One theory is that this is related
to Mary Robinson's visit.'' Ms. Robinson, the United Nations High
Commissioner on Human Rights, ended a 10-day trip to China on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Technically the three related groups of dissidents _ one from
Shandong Province, another from Hubei province and the last from
the three far northeastern provinces _ are seeking to register
their party as a social organization with the Civil Affairs
Ministry. There is no specific mechanism for forming a party.
</P>
<P>
   China has had no new party since the People's Republic was
founded in 1949. The Communist Party maintains tight control over
all aspects of the government, although technically there are a few
``democratic parties'' that predate 1949 and are allied with the
Communists.
</P>
<P>
   Dissidents in various regions have discussed forming the China
Democratic Party for much of this year and have drafted bylaws and
a manifesto that emphasizes democratic principles.
</P>
<P>
   But the recent applications have also stressed cooperation with
the government. The one from the northeast acknowledged ``the
status of the Chinese Communist Party as the governing party.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang said he was surprised by the central government's
dismissive statement. The applicants in Shandong and Hubei, Wang
added, received identical responses from local officials, making it
appear that some sort of revised government policy might have
evolved.
</P>
<P>
   A China specialist at Harvard, Roderick MacFarquhar, said China
might have practical reasons to allow a new party, albeit one of
limited scope. ``This way,'' he said, ``they can get these people
out of their lairs and try to co-opt them. Then again it may be
that in a month they'll all be thrown in jail.''

 By ALLAN RICHARDS and SERGIO R. BUSTOS 
 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    In Argentina, a pilot program involving companies with more than
100 employees allows workers to obtain a debit card if they choose
to have their paychecks electronically deposited to their bank
account.
 &HT;    It's just one marketing attempt by Visa International to
introduce middle-class Argentineans to the credit system. Similar
efforts are being carried out all over Latin America, a region
where, until a few years ago, only the affluent carried a credit
card. That is changing as U.S.-based credit card giants Visa,
MasterCard and American Express try to persuade more Latin
Americans to stuff a credit card into their wallets and purses.
 &HT;    As the credit card companies battle it out for a small but
growing market, they face a tall order in getting a predominantly
cash-oriented society to use plastic money.
 &HT;    ``The total penetration of all cards in Latin America (Visa,
MasterCard, American Express and Diners Club), in terms of personal
consumption expenditure, is only 4 percent,'' says James Partridge,
president of Visa's Latin America and Caribbean Region. He says 95
percent of all point-of-sale transactions are done using cash and
checks.
 &HT;    ``The majority of the people in the region are `unbanked,''' he
says. ``They do not have a relationship with a bank, much less a
credit account.''
 &HT;    Converting that 95 percent from cash and checks to credit cards
is largely being done through banks. Visa and MasterCard sell
franchises to different banks, which then issue debit and credit
cards.
 &HT;    ``The first step is to get unbanked people to have a deposit
account in the bank, then the debit cards are introduced, which
begins the process of replacing cash and checks and introduces them
to the concept of using a card to pay for their shopping,'' says
Partridge. ``Once they have the debit card, they can be worked into
a secured credit card and eventually an unsecured credit card.''
 &HT;    The primary credit card markets are Brazil, Mexico and
Argentina, comprising more than 70 percent of cardholders and
sales. Visa accounts for half the sales volume in the region. It
has 58 million cardholders (29.7 million credit cards; 28.3 debit
cards) and had sales volume of US$94.71 billion ($33 billion from
credit cards; the remaining from debit cards) for the four quarters
ending March 1998.
 &HT;    MasterCard had 20 million credit cardholders with sales of
nearly $25 billion in credit card sales in 1997.
 &HT;    Despite Visa's dominance, its total sales volume represents a
mere 2 percent of all personal spending in Latin America and the
Caribbean, according to Visa.
 &HT;    Both companies are using aggressive U.S.-style marketing
techniques, including direct mail and telemarketing campaigns, to
encourage the use of more credit cards.
 &HT;    Gabriel Alvarez, a senior MasterCard Vice President for
Marketing and Public Relations in the region, says his company
understands the marketing challenge. ``We have to prove to
consumers and merchants that using cards is in their best
interest,'' says Alvarez.
 &HT;    American Express _ third behind Visa and MasterCard in terms of
cardholders and sales volume in Latin America _ has traditionally
issued cards directly to customers. Now, it's modifying its
marketing strategy by linking up with banks and developing new
products.
 &HT;    ``We've introduced the Blue Card in Brazil which is geared to a
younger, aspiring consumer who shops a lot and travels,'' says Toby
Usnik, American Express International Public Affairs director.
``We've also begun marketing the Green Revolving Card in Mexico and
Argentina, which is aimed at middle income groups who want to
revolve payments instead of paying off their bills at the end of
the month.''
 &HT;    Will a continent so accustomed to cash or check transactions go
plastic?
 &HT;    ``It's not a question of if, but when,'' says Visa's Partridge,
who says only a few years ago Visa had less than 1 percent of
personal consumption expenditure in Brazil; now, it's more than 2
percent.
 &HT;    ``We project our personal consumption expenditure in all of
Latin America to double to 5 percent by 2002. I have no illusion
that it's going to take some time for consumers to make the
changeover, but we're penetrating the Latin American market.''
 &HT;    Pete Hisey, editor of the U.S.-based newsletter Credit Card
News, says emerging markets offer credit card companies growth
potential. ``Latin America is probably the easiest market to get
into because of its investment climate,'' he says.
 &HT;    But he cautions that developing the Latin American credit card
market won't happen overnight. ``The credit card is a practical
product, but it will take time for the idea to catch on with most
Latin Americans,'' he says. ``The basic way Latin Americans still
get credit these days is by writing a post-dated check.''

 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Un programa piloto argentino que abarca a empresas con mas de
100 empleados permite a los trabajadores recibir una tarjeta de
credito si transfieren automaticamente sus cheques de nomina a una
cuenta corriente.
 &HT;    Se trata de una campana de mercadeo de Visa Internacional para
hacer que la clase media argentina se familiarice con el sistema de
credito. En estos momentos se realizan esfuerzos similares en toda
America Latina, donde hasta hace muy pocos anos solo los adinerados
tenian tarjeta de credito. Pero la situacion cambia a medida que
gigantes como Visa, MasterCard y American Express tratan de
persuadir a mas latinoamericanos de llevar dinero plastico.
 &HT;    Pero estas empresas enfrentan un gran reto en hacer que
sociedades acostumbradas al efectivo se pasen al bando del dinero
plastico.
 &HT;    ``El indice de penetracion de todas las tarjetas (de credito) en
America Latina (Visa, MasterCard, American Express y Diners Club),
en terminos de gastos personales de consumo, solo alcanza el 4 por
ciento,'' explica James Partridge, presidente de Visa para America
Latina y el Caribe. Agrega que el 95 por ciento de todas las
transacciones de ventas todavia se realizan con efectivo y cheques.
 &HT;    ``La gran mayoria de los habitantes de la region no tiene cuenta
bancaria, y mucho menos credito,'' afirma.
 &HT;    Convertir ese 95 por ciento al dinero plastico es una labor que
se realiza en lo fundamental a traves de los bancos. Visa y
MasterCard venden franquicias a diferentes bancos, que a su vez
emiten tarjetas de credito y debito.
 &HT;    ``El primer paso es hacer que esas personas tengan una cuenta de
banco, y entonces se les ofrece una tarjeta de debito, que inicia
el proceso de reemplazar el efectivo y los cheques en las
transacciones, y los aboca al concepto de usar una tarjeta para
pagar sus compras,'' afirma Partridge. ``Una vez que tienen la
tarjeta de debito, se les puede emitir una tarjeta de credito con
garantia de deposito, y mas adelante, una tarjeta sin garantia de
deposito.''
 &HT;    Los principales mercados de tarjetas de credito son Brasil,
Mexico y Argentina, que abarcan mas del 70 por ciento de todos los
tarjetahabientes y ventas. Visa controla la mitad del volumen de
ventas en la region, con 58 millones de tarjetahabientes (29,7
millones de tarjetas de credito y 28,3 milles de tarjetas de
debito) y tuvo un volumen de ventas de US$94.710 millones
(US$33.000 millones de tarjetas de credito y el resto de tarjetas
de debito) durante los cuatro trimestres que concluyeron en marzo
de 1998.
 &HT;    Por su parte, MasterCard tiene 20 millones de tarjetahabientes
con ventas de US$25.000 millones en tarjetas de credito en todo
1997.
 &HT;    A pesar del dominio de Visa, su volumen total de ventas
representa solo un 2 por ciento de todo el gasto personal en
Latinoamerica y el Caribe, segun Visa.
 &HT;    Gabriel Alvarez, vicepresidente de Mercadeo y Relaciones
Publicas de MasterCard en America Latina, dice que su empresa
comprende el reto que enfrenta en materia de mercadeo: ``Hay que
probar a los consumidores y comerciantes que les conviene usar las
tarjetas.''
 &HT;    American Express, que ocupa el tercer lugar detras de Visa y
MasterCard en terminos de tarjetahabientes y volumen de ventas en
America Latina, historicamente ha emitido directamente sus tarjetas
a los clientes. Pero ha decidido modificar su estrategia de
mercadeo al aliarse con bancos y desarrollar nuevos productos.
 &HT;    ``En Brasil presentamos la Tarjeta Azul, dirigida al consumidor
joven en ascenso que compra mucho y viaja,'' dice Toby Usnik,
director de Relaciones Publicas de American Express International.
``Tambien hemos comenzado a comercializar la Tarjeta Verde de
Credito Renovable en Mexico y Argentina, dirigida a grupos de clase
media que desean pagar a plazos en vez de pagar el saldo completo
de su cuenta a finales de mes.''
 &HT;    Sera posible que un continente acostumbrado al efectivo y los
cheques acepte de buena gana las tarjetas de credito?
 &HT;    ``No es cuestion de si sucedera, sino cuando,'' afirma
Partridge, de Visa, y recuerda que hace solo unos anos Visa
manejaba las transacciones de menos del 1 por ciento de los gastos
personales de consumo en Brasil. Esa cifra ya supera el 2 por
ciento.
 &HT;    ``Proyectamos que nuestra cuota del consumo personal en toda
America Latina se duplique, al 5 por ciento, para el 2002. No me
hago ilusiones, va a tomar tiempo, pero ya estamos penetrando el
mercado latinoamericano,'' explica.
 &HT;    Peter Hisey, director de Credit Card News, un boletin
informativo que se edita en Estados Unidos, afirma que desarrollar
todo el potencial del mercado de tarjetas de credito de America
Latina no sucedera de la noche a la manana. ``La tarjeta de credito
es un producto practico, pero tomara tiempo que la idea prenda
entre la mayoria de los latinoamericanos,'' afirma Hisey.
