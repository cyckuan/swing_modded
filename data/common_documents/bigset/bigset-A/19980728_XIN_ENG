<HEADLINE> Ensuring Economic Security Vital for FSB: Russian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko Monday said the Federal Security Service (FSB) faces the
serious task of ensuring economic security, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko made the remark as he introduced to the FSB collegium
its newly-appointed chief Vladimir Putin, who replaced Nikolai
Kovalyov last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It is particularly important for the service to ensure economic
security, and Putin's work in the presidential administration has
enabled him to gain knowledge and experience in combating economic
crimes, Kiriyenko said.
</P>
<P>
Putin, 46, a former employee with the USSR State Security
Committee (KGB), joined the presidential administration in 1996
and was appointed first deputy head in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
The premier said the replacement is not an indication of the
president's or the government's dissatisfaction with the work of
either Kovalyov or the service.
</P>
<P>
"Conditions are changing, people are changing," he said, and
Kovalyov's experience and capability "will continue to be used to
the Motherland's benefit."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the presentation ceremony, Kovalyov, the former FSB
chief, said the country's economic security, in particular
countering economic espionage and the illegal export of capital,
will be the most important job for the FSB.

<HEADLINE> Boris Yeltsin Accused of Dissolving Soviet Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin was
accused on Monday by Russian lawmakers of causing the dissolution
of the Soviet Union in 1991 in order to seize and consolidate
power, the Itar-Tass news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a parliamentary commission on the impeachment of
President Yeltsin, lawmaker Viktor Ilyukhin said that Yeltsin
shared the blame with other republics' leaders who "did not have
the necessary status to sign those agreements and thus to
liquidate the USSR."
</P>
<P>
The Russian president's opponents insist that Yeltsin committed
high treason in signing the Belovezhye accords with other
republics that dissolved the USSR in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The accords can also be regarded as "illegal" because the 1922
Soviet Union founding treaty did not allow for its denunciation,
but only gave each republic the right to secede from the union,
Ilyukhin said.
</P>
<P>
"The Belovezhye agreements are an apparent violation of the
constitutional rights of all Russian citizens," Ilyukhin said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the consequences of these accords are so
grave that they should be the subject of a special meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Belovezhye accords were the first point on the five-point
indictment to be considered by the impeachment commission of the
State Duma, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Under the Russian Constitution and the Duma's rules, the
commission can only recommend whether the president can face
criminal charges for what he has done.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary commission on impeaching Yeltsin will meet
again on august 17, Filimonov announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
The action group has gathered 217 signatures under the
indictment, more than the required 150 signatures, commission
deputy head Yelena Mizulina said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Existing Home Sales Decline in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. resales of existing
single-family homes dropped 2.3 percent in June after posting a
record high in May, the National Association of Realtors reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The decrease brought the seasonally adjusted sales rate to 4.72
million, down from 4.83 million, the highest since the association
began tracking sales in 1968.
</P>
<P>
Sales this year are being supported by unemployment near a
28-year low, healthy income growth, robust stock market gains and
low mortgage rates, which averaged 7 percent in June for 30-year
fixed-rate loans.
</P>
<P>
Fred Flick, the association's vice president for economic
research, predicted sales for all of 1998 would total around 4.54
million, 7.7 percent higher than 1997, when a record 4.21 million
homes were sold.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, the West recorded the largest drop in June, down
10.9 percent to an annual rate of 980,000 units. Sales also fell
in the Northeast, by 5.6 percent to a rate of 670,000 units.
</P>
<P>
Sales increased 1.7 percent to a rate of 1.2 million units in
the Midwest and 1.6 percent to a rate of 1.87 million units in the
South.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, the median sales price of an existing home was
134,600 U.S. dollars in June, up 5.8 percent from a year earlier.

UNITED NATIONS, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Mobilization of resources
and promotion of international cooperation should form the core
work of the U.N. Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), Deputy
Chinese Representative to the U.N. Shen Guofang said here on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Adequate resources are an essential prerequisite for successful
follow-up to major international conferences, he told an ECOSOC
session.
</P>
<P>
Shen said it is necessary to strengthen coordination between
the council and U.N. funds and agencies, including the Bretton-
woods institutions.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, if the trend of weakening international
cooperation and the steady decline of official development
assistance (ODC) cannot be reversed, then coordination alone is
not going to produce miracles.
</P>
<P>
Because of different conditions and development priorities,
U.N. operational activities for development should take full
account of the conditions of the countries concerned and provide
assistance under the guidance of the governments, he stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 27 (Xinhua) -- A Dutch Justice Ministry employee
was confirmed to have collected and stored child pornography
materials in the ministry's computer system, ministry sources said
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The employee was already dismissed from his computer management
post in the general affairs administration department of the
Justice Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The case first came to light in April this year when another
employee of the department found child pornography materials on
computers and reported the finding to department management.
</P>
<P>
The employee who collected and stored the pornographic
materials was immediately suspended from his job and was dismissed
after police investigation was completed on July 17.
</P>
<P>
Ministry sources said that the employee in question was not a
senior ministry official as some Dutch press reports had
suggested.
</P>
<P>
The public prosecutor handling the case has possession of all
the documents and will now decide whether criminal prosecution
will follow.
</P>
<P>
Ministry sources also clarified that the case of the employee
was not linked to the current Zandvoort child pornography case
that was disclosed after a Dutch man was found killed in an
Italian town earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch authorities have expressed their determination to
clamp down on child pornography and Dutch police is conducting
investigation in close cooperation with its colleagues in
neighboring Belgium and Germany.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Anti-Flood efforts have entered a
crucial stage in central and eastern parts of China as several
provinces declared a state of emergency today and floodwaters
continued to rise on the country's largest river, Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
People are holding their breath as the third flood peak
passes. It is the second largest in the Yangtze Basin since 1954,
and the central government has called for a do or die effort in
protecting major cities and river and lake embankments and
ministries are being told to join the effort.
</P>
<P>
The State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters and
several ministries have sent teams to direct local flood-relief
work.
</P>
<P>
In Wuhan, capital of Hubei Province and the largest industrial
center in central China, and in Jiujiang, a tourist city in
Jiangxi Province, hundreds of thousands of people are watching the
river dikes and immediately repairing any minor defects that could
lead to breaches.
</P>
<P>
Citizens have been mobilized for the effort or asked to make
donations, says Jiujiang's Mayor Liu Shangyang. As of 1:00 pm
Monday, its citizens had collected over 60 million cubic meters of
stone, 20 million cubic meters of largerocks, 300,000 straw
sandbags and 200,000 chemical fiber sand bags.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 200,000 people have been evacuated to safe places in
southern Hunan Province, and local government offices have sent
food, clean water, medicines and tents to the flooded areas.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 100,000 soldiers and armed police involved
in the struggle who the local press have lionized with the term
"suicide squads" because of the difficult and dangerous fight
against the rising waters. Military trucks, boats and aircraft
have been working day and night to deliver relief goods.
</P>
<P>
Medical workers have also joined the effort to prevent a
possible outbreak of epidemic disease. So far no cases have been
reported, even though the flooded areas have also been hit by a
heat wave.
</P>
<P>
People in other parts of the country have been offering help to
the affected areas. Shanghai, which is at the mouth of the Yangtze
River, have donated goods worth more than one million yuan.

1.93 tons a month in the first five months of the year as against
2.02 tons last year, Zimbabwe's First Merchant Bank said Monday.eE

viability problems facing the country's mining industry owing to
low mineral prices and rising production costs.
</P>
<P>
"Output figures have fallen with the closure of several gold
mines and more are expected to cease operation in the next few
months as a result of the disappointing drift in gold prices,"
the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The gold price was quoted at 290.60 U.S.Dollars an ounce in
early Monday trade in Harare.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- China Monday granted Zambia 20
million RMB Yuan or 2.5 million U.S. Dollars for Zambia's
economic and technical activities.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed here in Lusaka by Sun Guangxiang,
Chinese Vice-Minister for Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation,
who is heading a 19-member delegation, and Godfrey Simasiku,
Zambia's Deputy Minister of Finance and Economic Development.
</P>
<P>
China also agreed to assist Zambia in the feasibility study to
install FM radio broadcasting equipment as well as auxiliary
equipment for six provincial broadcasting stations in Zambia
through change of notes on the same occasion.
</P>
<P>
If the results of the feasibility study prove positive, the
two countries will sign another agreement for the implementation
of the project, according to Simasiku.
</P>
<P>
In a statement following the signing ceremony, Simasiku urged
the Chinese government and businessmen to invest in Zambia and
establish joint ventures with the Zambians in a bid to explore
the country's potentials in tourism, agriculture, mining,
manufacture, energy, communication and transport.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian deputy minister spoke highly of the existing
friendship between the two countries and expressed his "profound"
gratitude to China for granting the money.
</P>
<P>
In a brief speech, the Chinese vice-minister said China will
continue to assist Zambia and help it to establish medium and
small size productive projects which are lucrative.

<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Incumbent Co-Premier Hun Sen's
Cambodian People's Party (CPP) appeared set to win Sunday's
multi-party general elections, according to initial results
provided by the opposition Sam Rainsy Party Monday.
</P>
<P>
The CPP collected 50 seats in the 122-seat National Assembly,
to be followed by ousted First Prime Minister Prince Norodom
Ranariddh's Funcinpec with 43 seats and former Finance Minister
Sam Rainsy's Sam Rainsy Party with 29 seats, the Sam Rainsy Party
said.
</P>
<P>
However, initial results have yet to be officially announced by
the National Election Committee (NEC), which postponed the
announcement, originally scheduled for Monday evening, until
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to initial results faxed to Xinhua by the Sam Rainsy
Party, the CPP collected a total of 451,567 votes, or 38.3
percent, while Funcinpec 442,019, or 37.5 percent, and the Sam
Rainsy Party 284,865, or 24.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Under Cambodia's Constitution, a party needs a two-thirds
majority or 82 seats in the National Assembly to form a
government. Therefore, the CPP will have to form a coalition with
Funcinpec or the Sam Rainsy Party, or possibly even both, with the
CPP naming the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
But Ranariddh told Xinhua earlier in the day that he would not
work as deputy premier or whatsoever under Hun Sen, who deposed
him in July last year. The two men led a coalition government, a
product of the 1993 United Nations-organized election.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's election drew worldwide attention as it was highly
expected to give Cambodia a second chance for peace, stability and
a legitimate government.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Open to Any Peace Initiative: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' President Glafcos
Clerides said Monday his government welcomes any peace initiative
on solving the Cyprus issue, either from the U.N. Security Council
or the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Clerides made the remark in a statement issued in response to
criticism from the left-wing opposition Working People's
Progressive Party (AKEL) on the government's handling of the
peace talks and its plan to deploy Russian missiles.
</P>
<P>
"We accepted and will accept any initiative from the Security
Council or any EU member state, and always weigh up their
interests in relation to Turkey on one hand, and on the other,
their aim for a lasting and steady solution to the Cyprus
problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
AKEL's General Secretary Demetris Christofias has strongly
criticized the government for failing to break the impasse in the
Cyprus peace talks, charging it for "putting all its eggs in one
basket" by relying on only the United States.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said that he would accept a U.S. initiative on Cyprus,
but would not accept anything that would endanger the Cypriot
people's future or would not bring about a fair, just and viable
solution.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the S-300 surface-to-air missiles Cyprus ordered
from Russia in January 1997, Clerides said they would increase
the country's air defense capability.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his government would not bow to threats over
the missile issue although it was well aware of the the
international reaction. "The government handles this reaction
responsibly, without giving in to threats," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and EU have criticized Cyprus' plan to deploy the
Russian missiles, while Turkey has threatened to launch preemptive
strikes against the missiles if they are deployed.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to settle the Cyprus problem reached a stalemate in
last August when Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash walked out
of a U.N.-sponsored direct peace talks between the two Cypriot
communities following a EU decision to start accession talks
with the Clerides-led Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has announced he would not return to the peace talks
unless his breakaway regime in northern Cyprus is recognized and
Cyprus halts its accession talks with the EU.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

LUANDA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- United Nations mission in Angola
will continue to investigate in the killings last week in
northeast Angola's Lunda-Norte Province.
</P>
<P>
The investigation team, which went to the scene of violence
last Saturday to seek information from local leaders, will once
again set for Bula Town in the province for further probe,
according to David Wimhurst, spokesman for the U.N. mission after

</P>
<P>
Reports said militiamen of the opposition National Union for

unarmed civilians and wounding dozens of others.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Russian Government to Sell 5% Gazprom Stake in Full </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Under a Russian president's decree
the Russian government will sell five percent of its stake in the
gas giant Gazprom in full, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin last Saturday signed a decree
to sell five percent of the natural gas monopoly Gazprom, while 35
percent of the Gazprom stock would remain state property, in order
to boost state coffers while keeping the company under state
control.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov said in Kaliningrad
that "five percent is just the right figure that will enable us to
do that without harming the country or the company."
</P>
<P>
Vice-president of the Gazprom Pyotr Rodionov told a press
conference on Monday that the Gazprom management knew about the
preparation of corresponding presidential instructions and
recommended the sale of the five percent stake in full.
</P>
<P>
In Rodionov's view Gazprom may reduce, within three years, the
production and supply of gas for domestic consumption from over
300 billion cubic meters to 80 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
CEO of Gazprom Rem Vyakhirev said that tentative talks must be
held with Gazproms's strategic partners, Royal Dytch Shell and
ENI, on the sale of the five percent Gazprom stock held by the
state.
</P>
<P>
The goal is to obtain the largest possible amount of money for
the federal budget and to keep the company's shares from sliding
on the stock market, Vyakhirev's press secretary Gennady Yezhov
said.
</P>
<P>
The state currently holds 40.9 percent of Gazprom, which
produces 94 percent of Russia's gas and accounts for a quarter of
all the gas produced throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Gazprom, according to Russian officials, owes the government

<HEADLINE> Israeli Knesset Rejects No-Confidence Motions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Two days before its summer
recess, Israeli Knesset (Parliament) Monday rejected three
no-confidence motions against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Despite the voting result of 42-20, the motions, tabled by the
opposition Labor, Meretz and Hadash parties, still failed to pass
due to the lack of the 61 votes needed in such vote.
</P>
<P>
Under the Israeli law, the government has to step down if a
no-confidence motion is passed by a majority of 61 votes in the
120-seat Knesset.
</P>
<P>
The Netanyahu-led coalition is having a slim 61 majority in the
Knesset.
</P>
<P>
In the no-confidence motions, the opposition parties blamed the
government for the prolonged deadlock of the peace talks with the
Palestinians that began since early last year.
</P>
<P>
They also accused Netanyahu of leading the country to a
disaster through his hard-line policies in the negotiations with
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The peace process has been stalled since March last year when
Israel began construction of a Jewish settlement in the
traditionally Arab East Jerusalem. The talks are currently stuck
over Israel's delay in carrying out the second further withdrawal
from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Monday's vote was regarded by Labor and Meretz as a prelude to
two bills they will present for the preliminary reading Wednesday
calling for the dissolution of the Knesset and holding early
elections.
</P>
<P>
Only a simple majority is needed in the preliminary reading
on the two bills, but their passage through the three readings in
the next Knesset session still requires the absolute majority of
61 votes.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset will reconvene on October 19.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM Urges Turkey, Greece to Better Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi Monday called on Turkey and Greece to make efforts to
improve their bitter relations, according to the Anatolia News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Prodi made the call at a joint press conference with his
Turkish counterpart Mesut Yilmaz in Turkey's largest city of
Istanbul, where he was on a one-day working visit.
</P>
<P>
He said that concrete steps must be taken to decrease the
current tension in Cyprus, and urged Yilmaz and Greek Prime
Minister Costas Simitis to make a difference in that respect.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is damaging the economies of both Greece and
Turkey and increasing the military spending of the two
countries," said the Italian prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), have long been at odds over a number of
disputes such as the Cyprus issue, air space limit and right of
sea-bed mineral resources in the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
Early last week, Yilmaz visited northern Cyprus, where Turkish
Cypriots had declared a breakaway state, to attend a ceremony
marking the 24th anniversary of the Turkish military intervention
in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The visit again prompted strong protests from Greece and
Cyprus, with which the European Union (EU) has begun negotiations
in order to bring it into fold.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops landed and took over the northern third of the island in
the wake of a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
With regard to Turkey's tension with the EU, Prodi said that
his country supports Turkey's bid to become a full EU member.
"Turkey and the EU are obliged to go together in the long run. The
destiny is for cooperation and mutual understanding," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Turkey-EU relations worsened after Turkey cut off political
dialogue with the EU to protest that it was excluded from EU's
first enlargement plan.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Yilmaz said Turkey welcomes Italian businessmen's
participation in its energy and defense projects as well as its
huge privatization program.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers also discussed the deteriorating Kosovo
crisis, and called on the international community to prevent a
new war in the Balkan region.

<HEADLINE> Kidnapped French Released in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Two French nationals kidnapped
by gunmen in the northeastern coast of Somalia were released
Monday after 52 days of captivity in a small village controlled
by the Somali Salvation Democratic Front (SSDF) faction.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said the release of the hostages were
resulted from pressure by politicians and clan elders. The
elders told reporters that the release was unconditional
despite the repetitive demand made by the gunmen for a ransom of
75,000 US Dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, some unconfirmed reports said at least 50,000 U.S.
Dollars had been paid to secure the safe release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
The elders who disassociated themselves from being members of
the disputed autonomous administration which was announced
Thursday in Garowe district, northeast Somalia, said the French
tourists are now healthy and good looking.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the report, the elders did not say a
word about a yacht the French men were travelling on to the
Reunion island controlled by France near Madagascar.
</P>
<P>
The efforts for the release of the French men came after one
of the hostages became terribly sick and the other started fasting
from all kinds of food for three days in protest against their
continued abduction.
</P>
<P>
This had resulted after the gunmen moved the French men to
Buro village, 45 km east of the port town of Bossaso in the
middle of last month, where access of vehicles was difficult.
</P>
<P>
The elders were supported by the United Nations and European
Union offices in Bossaso for securing the release.

<HEADLINE> Romania not on the Brink of Economic Crisis: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Romania is not on the brink of
a economic crisis; on the contrary, prospects for economic
relaunch are looming ahead, the Prime Minister Radu Vasile told
local daily National Journal in an interview on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It may be said that the state-budget is facing a crisis of
liquidity since the income from privatization and tax collection
has not been fully attained," Radu Vasile said, adding that "yet
the situation will trigger no crisis thanks to the Government's
tight control over the inflation rate."
</P>
<P>
"Putting a halt to economic progress is very realistic and will
contribute to the start in 1999 of economic recovery. Some mental
and instrumental factors that have so far accumulated will allow
the Government a good start, albeit not a spectacular one, enough
to restore trust in the times to come," the Premier said.
</P>
<P>
He reckoned that the first positive effects on people and the
living standards in Romania would be felt at the end of 1999 and
the beginning of the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Satellite Images Confirm Sign of  Warming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Satellite images from the
world's coldest continent Antarctica have confirmed the rapid
melting of a key Antarctic glacier, a 20-mile-wide river of ice
whose retreat could eventually lead to the collapse of major ice
sheets and a resulting rise in global sea levels.
</P>
<P>
After studying satellite data collected from 1992 to 1996, Eric
Rignot, a radar scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
California, have come to the above conclusion, The Washington Post
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Pine Island Glacier is often described as the "soft
underbelly" of the Western Antarctic Ice Sheet because it is
exposed to relatively warm South Pacific waters and is thought to
be especially vulnerable to rising temperatures.
</P>
<P>
Their new research shows the glacier is indeed shrinking at
remarkably fast clip, retreating inland at the rate of about a
half-mile a year.
</P>
<P>
They said still unclear is whether the melting is due to
human-induced global warming or other factors.

ANKARA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
urged Monday the international community to take urgent measures
to stop the bloodshed in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Presidential Palace said that Demirel
had sent letters to the Contact Group countries and some Balkan
nations to express deep concern over the Kosovo crisis, which he
described as "a serious threat to the stability and security in
southeastern Europe."
</P>
<P>
"Turkey was ready to take part in any initiative to solve

</P>
<P>
Demirel called on the Yugoslav government to take immediate
actions to open a constructive dialog with representatives from
all the peoples in the region, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
"This dialog should be aimed at ensuring democratic rights
and basic freedoms for all Kosovo inhabitants, regardless of
their ethnic identity," Demirel said.
</P>
<P>
Since February, fierce fighting has erupted between the Serbian
forces and ethnic Albanian guerrillas who demand independence from
Yugoslavia.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Colonial Powers Blamed for Burundi Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 27 (Xinhua) -- A Burundian rebel leader
said Monday in Arusha, north Tanzania, that colonial powers
perpetuated ethnic division in the central African nation and
significantly contributed to the current civil strife there.
</P>
<P>
Presenting FROLINA (the Front for National Liberation)'s views
on the genesis of the Burundi conflict, the Hutu rebel group's
leader, Joseph Karumba, said German and Belgian rulers in history
perpetuated the domination of Tutsi and discriminated both the
majority Hutus, accounting for 85 percent of the country's
population, and Twa which represents one percent.
</P>
<P>
Burundi was ruled by Germany between 1886 and 1914 and later
by Belgium during 1914 and 1962.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, Karumba said the
colonialists deliberately favored Tutsis, whereas the Hutus and
Twa, were mistreated and disregarded.
</P>
<P>
"The Belgians enforced the discriminatory system by
maintaining the Tutsis in a privileged status," he alleged,
adding that education was only offered exclusively to Tutsi
children and Tutsis were favored with social, economic and
political advantages.
</P>
<P>
The Belgians ruled with a similar system, he said at the
plenary session of Burundian peace talks chaired by international
peace facilitator, Julius Nyerere, former president of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The Tutsis, he added, were described by colonial rulers as
wise, intelligent, lovely and good-looking people, while Hutus
were relegated as unwise, ignorant, unkind and unfaithful
peasants.
</P>
<P>
Karumba also said that during different historical periods from
King Mwami to the current leadership of military strongman Pierre
Buyoya, Hutus have been systematically excluded or killed to make
Tutsis dominate the political, economic and social scene of
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Burundians have to change their ideas in order to remove the
Hutu-Tutsi barrier, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to remove our ethnic differences which were long
associated with conflicts, and which too often led to dangerous
political arguments for the priority of one group and negligence
or even suppression of the others," he said.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader suggested 14 points to end ethnic violence in
Burundi, including recognizing the dignity and rights of all
Burundians, encouraging Burundians to reaffirm their commitment
to fundamental human rights.
</P>
<P>
He also said Burundi should recognize international legal
organizations so as to implement human rights, and abolish
negative laws and practices.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, People's Reconciliation Party (PRP), one of the
parties at the talks, said that absence of a king in Burundi had
led to such brutal ethnic violence. Sylvestre Ntibantunganya,
former president of Burundi, claimed that previous insincerity of
governments had plunged the land-locked Burundi into
unprecedented crisis between Hutus and Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
Twelve parties, rebel groups and two former presidents of
Burundi have made their statements on the nature of the conflict
in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere's spokesman, Brigadier General Hashim Mbita, said five
more parties will give speeches on Tuesday morning to wind up the
agenda of debate on the Burundi conflict.
</P>
<P>
He also said the other item on the agenda adopted last week,
the issue of rules for the negotiation procedure, may be ready by
Tuesday for discussion by all warring parties.
</P>
<P>
"The talks have made substantial progress and we hope to wind
up the Burundi conflict debate tomorrow," Mbita told reporters at
the end of the sixth day of peace talks at the Arusha International
Conference Center.
</P>
<P>
The talks bring the government of Pierre Buyoya, who took
power in a July 1996 coup, face to face with Hutu rebels who are
fighting the country's Tutsi-dominated army.

<HEADLINE> Blair Strengthens Control Through Cabinet Reshuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 27 (Xinhua) - British Prime Minister Tony Blair
made the first reshuffle of his cabinet on Monday since Labor
swept to power 15 months ago by sacking four ministers.
</P>
<P>
Social Security Secretary Harriet Harman, one of the most
high-profile women in the cabinet and role model for middle-class
New Labour feminists, were out of the cabinet office.
</P>
<P>
Also dismissed were the government's leader in the House of
Lords Ivor Richard, public services minister David Clark and
transport minister Gavin Strang.
</P>
<P>
The major ministers in the cabinet all kept their jobs --
Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, Home Secretary (interior
minister) Jack Straw, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and Education
Secretary David Blunkett.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Blair's key aide and minister without portfolio,
Peter Mandelson, takes over the Department of Trade and Industry,
according to Blair's official spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson, a pro-European rightwinger with close links to
business, replaces Margaret Beckett, who will stay in the cabinet
as leader of the House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Secretary Jack Cunningham, a veteran Labor
politician, was given a new job co-ordinating the work of the
cabinet and resolving disputes between ministries. His job will be
replaced by Nick Brown, who has up to now been government chief
whip, responsible for discipline in Labour's House of Commons
ranks.
</P>
<P>
Baroness Margaret Jay, daughter of 1970s Labor prime minister
Lord Callaghan, enters the cabinet as government leader in the
House of Lords.
</P>
<P>
Alistair Darling, chief secretary to the Treasury, is promoted
to be new Social Security Secretary.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Byers, currently Schools Standards minister, will join
the cabinet as Chief Secretary to the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
John Reid moves to be transport minister from defense ministry,
where he was armed forces minister.
</P>
<P>
The government spokesman said Blair's aim was to strengthen the
center of his government.
</P>
<P>
Under party rules, Blair had been obliged to choose his first
government from the "shadow cabinet" elected by Labor members of
parliament while they were in opposition.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leonean Rebel Leader Calls for Truce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's rebel leader Foday
Sankoh, sent back home for trial from more than one year's
detention in Nigeria, has called on his supporters to cease fire
and make peaceful dialog with the government.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh, who appeared on the state television in handcuffs at
the weekend, condemned atrocities against civilians blamed on his
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels and remnants of the
military junta forces, according to a report reaching here Monday
from Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"I appeal to RUF rebels and junta to cease fire immediately
and let us talk peace," Sankoh said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the civil defense force known as Kamajors, loyal
to President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, to do the same.
</P>
<P>
"You see the RUF and the Kamajors must stop the fighting
against the people. And I think we can solve our problem in
peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh appeared on television with Information Minister Julius
Spencer after Nigeria flew him back to Sierra Leone earlier in
the day, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The RUF leader was arrested and put into house arrest in March
1996 when he arrived in Nigeria ostensibly on a peace mission.
</P>
<P>
Following his arrest, a division arose within the RUF ranks on
whether to continue or abandon the rebellion the armed group
launched since 1991 against successive governments.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Sankoh, some 40 soldiers of the former Sierra
Leonean armed forces are already on trial for treason in
connection with their role in the May 25, 1997 coup which ousted
Kabbah's government.
</P>
<P>
The junta, which named Sankoh the number two person of the
country, was toppled in mid-February this year.
</P>
<P>
The trial will resume Tuesday. It was unclear when Sankoh,
whose trial had been predicted by officials before his
extradition, would appear in court.
</P>
<P>
The remnants of the junta and allied RUF rebels are still
holding parts of mineral rich areas in the east and north of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian-led west African peacekeeping force, which
restored Kabbah's government in March this year, is stepping up
its mopping up exercise for an early wipe out of the forces.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkey on Monday condemned
Switzerland for permitting the convening of an anti-Turkish
meeting in the Swiss city of Lausanne by Kurdish rebel groups,
the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a written statement that the
Swiss decision displayed its "unfriendly attitude" toward Turkey and
would undermine the Turkish-Swiss relations.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn the Swiss federal government for the insensitive
stance it has adopted on anti-Turkish activities in its country,
despite repeated warnings from Turkey," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Several Kurdish groups organized an anti-Turkish rally Friday
in Lausanne where the historical Lausanne Treaty was signed in
1923 marking the founding of modern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Lausanne Treaty replaced the 1920 Sevres Treaty which
envisaged the establishment of an autonomous Kurdish region in
southeastern Turkey and a final independent Kurdish state.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Lausanne municipal authorities
rejected a request from the Turkish Embassy to hold a celebration
ceremony marking the 75th anniversary of the signing of the
Lausanne Treaty in a palace where the document was inked.
</P>
<P>
Swiss officials said that such an official ceremony might
provoke protests from the Kurds and Armenians living in the
neutral European state.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry described the Swiss government's
refusal to allow the celebration on the 75th anniversary of the
Lausanne Treaty as "incomprehensible and unacceptable."

<HEADLINE> Four Russian Politicians Call for Concern over Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Four leading Russian politicians in
an appeal to the Russian president and government said on Monday
that the forthcoming meeting between the Russian authorities and
the Chechen leader is "more than topical now", according to the
Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
Russian ex-prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, Krasnoyardk
governor Alexander Lebed, Tatar President Mintimer Shaimiyev and
CIS Executive Committee Secretary Boris Berezovsky said in the
appeal "the meeting will take place against the backdrop of the
deteriorating social, economic and political situation in the
Chechen Republic."
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko and Chechen President
Aslan Maskhadov agreed to meet later this week, but the time and
location for the meeting has not been set yet.
</P>
<P>
The four said that they are turning to the government of the
Russian Federation with anxiety. It must immediately formulate a
position on the understandable for society, and consistently
implement it.
</P>
<P>
"We have paid too dear a price for recent mistakes and silence
and Russia has no right to return the mid-1990s again," they said.
</P>
<P>
Ivan Rybkin, who heads the Russian part of the bilateral
commission, singled out the block of social and economic issues as
the most pressing of those to be discussed at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
It was Russian President Boris Yeltsin who ordered Kiriyenko to
meet Maskhadov to demonstrate support for his government. However,
the Chechen president plans to use the meeting to press Moscow to
pay out promised economic support, the report said.

<HEADLINE> AL Chief to Visit Libya on Lockerbie Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Ahmed
Esmat Abdel-Meguid will visit Libya next week for talks on the
latest developments of the Lockerbie issue, the Egyptian Middle
East News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid told reporters that he will discuss with the
Libyan side "all aspects of the Libya-West crisis" and a plan of
Arab action aimed at settling the Lockerbie issue.
</P>
<P>
Two Libyans have been suspected of bombing a Pan Am jetliner
over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, killing 270 people.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain have demanded that the two
suspects be tried in either of the two countries. Fearing that its
citizens would not receive a fair trial, Libya insists that they
be tried in a neutral place.
</P>
<P>
In an about-face gesture, the U.S. and Britain agreed last week
to have the two Libyans tried in the Hague, the Netherlands. The
development has been hailed by the Arab League as a "diplomatic
and political victory for the Arab world."
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid said "the talks in Tripoli will take up ways of
lifting the international sanctions imposed against Libya,
particularly after the U.S. and Britain accepted an Arab proposal
to have the two Libyan suspects tried in a Dutch court according
to the Scottish law."
</P>
<P>
He sent a message on Monday to the United Nations Secretary
General Kofi Annan, expressing the league's readiness to cooperate
with the world organization in dealing with the Lockerbie crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to fully cooperate with the United Nations in
facilitating the mission of all parties concerned to reach a
peaceful settlement to the issue, guaranteeing the rights of all
parties and leading to lifting the sanctions off Tripoli," he said
in the message.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed air and arms embargo against
Libya in 1992 after Tripoli refused to hand over the two suspects
for trial.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian First Lady in Accra for Peace Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's new First Lady Fati
Abubakar has arrived in Accra, Ghana, to attend the summit of
West African First Ladies' Peace Mission opening Monday, a report
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
She arrived in Accra on Monday and was received at the Kotoko
International Airport by Nana
Rawlings, her Ghanaian counterpart and the First Vice-Chairperson
of the mission, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The regional first ladies' summit is the first official public
engagement of the Nigerian first lady, since her husband, General
Abdulsalam Abubakar was appointed the new head of state following
the death of former military leader General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Abubakar is a judge at the Abuja High Court in Nigerian
capital.
</P>
<P>
The Accra meeting is expected to be attended by all the first
ladies of the west African sub-region and will last until
Wednesday, during which conflict situation in the region will be
addressed.
</P>
<P>
A program of activities for the summit showed that the first
ladies would look at the conflict situation in Africa generally
and present papers on the situation in their respective countries
since the first meeting of the region in June 1996 in Abuja.
</P>
<P>
International organizations such as the United Nations
Development Program and the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees are also expected to address the summit and review the
refugee situation in Liberia, Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone and
Senegal, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia, Eritrea Urged to End Hostilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 27 (Xinhua) -- President Hassan Gouled Aptidon
of Djibouti and President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya Monday urged
Ethiopia and Eritrea to cease hostilities and honor the decision
by the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
"As neighbors of Ethiopia and Eritrea, Kenya and Djibouti are
gravely concerned with the conflict which is a threat to peace in
the region," the two presidents said in a joint communique issued
following their talks here.
</P>
<P>
All the four countries are members of the Inter-Governmental
Authority on Development (IGAD) which also groups Uganda, Somalia
and Sudan. Aptidon, who paid one-day visit to Kenya, has
replaced Moi as the rotating IGAD chairman.
</P>
<P>
"An IGAD heads of state and government summit would be
convened after submission of the OAU report in order to determine
further direction on the conflict," said the communique.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here, OAU said Monday it would
present its report this week on a fact-finding mission into a
border dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The report is expected to comment on where the borders lay and
who administered the territory before the dispute began.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Moi held talks here respectively with
Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and his Eritrean
counterpart Isaias Afwerki. However, no breakthrough was made.
</P>
<P>
Moi's move was seen as the latest of a series of international
mediation efforts since border clashes erupted between the two
Horn of Africa countries on May 6.
</P>
<P>
Tensions escalated in early June when the two sides bombed
each other and battles raged for a brief period on three fronts.
Hundreds were killed before fighting gave way to a stalemate on
the border where thousands of troops are massed on each side.
</P>
<P>
In June, Eritrea rejected a proposal by the U.S. and Rwanda to
end the fighting. Further attempts by African heads of state
from Burkina Faso, Zimbabwe and Djibouti also made little
headway.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of Asylum Seekers May Be Allowed to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Up to 30,000 asylum seekers may be
allowed to stay in Britain, Home Secretary Jack Straw announced on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
As part of this process, most of the 10,000 people who have
been waiting for five years for an initial ruling would be allowed
to stay in Britain indefinitely, Straw's office said.
</P>
<P>
"The delay in reaching a decision would normally be considered
to be such a significant factor that indefinite leave to remain
would normally be appropriate," it said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the cases of 20,000 people who arrived between
July 1993 and the end of 1995 would be reviewed under a
"streamlined" system.
</P>
<P>
But Straw said in the parliament that he planned tougher
treatment for new arrivals in the future, including assigning them
accommodation while their cases were assessed.
</P>
<P>
About 75,000 people are waiting for a decision on applications
to British immigration officers for political asylum.
</P>
<P>
A large proportion of them have been in Britain for years,
either waiting for hard-pressed immigration officers to process
their claims, or going through a complex appeals system.
</P>
<P>
Straw said he was stepping up government funds devoted to
processing claims with the aim of ending the backlog by April,
2001.
</P>
<P>
Successive governments have been battling to cope with
increasing numbers of asylum applications from people arriving and
claiming to be at risk if they return home.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Announces Tariff Cuts for WTO Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, July 27 (Xinhua) -- In an effort to win entry into
the World Trade Organization (WTO), Sudan has decided to cut
taxes and custom duties, Sudanese Finance Minister Abdel-Wahab
Osman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a press conference, Osman said the decision would
take effect in six months when Sudan adopts a law on taxes, which
outlines the details of the tax reform.
</P>
<P>
He said the average custom duties would be first lowered to 80
percent and finally be replaced by consumption taxes to protect
domestic products.
</P>
<P>
Sudan would continue the process of lifting all the customs in a
bid to meet WTO's demands, he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister said his country would cancel the 19 percent
tariff on imported goods and a number of domestic products. The
tariff includes the 4 percent protection tax, 5 percent service
tax and 10 percent consumption tax.
</P>
<P>
Sudan would exempt some products and services from import and
export tariffs, including wheat, pesticide, medicine, milk,
insurance, education and medical services, Osman said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the new tax policy was aimed at protecting the
domestic industry, ensuring national revenues and offsetting the
negative effects on the Sudanese people caused by the country's
entry to WTO.

<HEADLINE> WFP Calls for Funding for Emergency Food Aid to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food
Program Monday issued an urgent appeal to increase its funding so
as to expand emergency food aid to war and drought-torn southern
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
"We will need a great deal of help from the donor community if
we are to prevent an all-out famine in Sudan," said WFP Executive
Director Catherine Bertini in a news release reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came at a time when the food crisis in Sudan
continues to worsen, especially in the south of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Rome-based U.N. food aid agency said recent mass movements
of people in search of food and safety in southern Sudan have
increased the demand for food.
</P>
<P>
Unofficial reports indicate that up to 80 people are dying of
malnutrition each day in Wau, the capital of the Bahr el Ghazal
region, said WFP.
</P>
<P>
WFP now estimates that its emergency food requirement amounts
to 129,000 tons against the original estimate in April of about
82,500 tons. WFP is targeting 2.6 million people throughout
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
WFP is appealing to donors to provide food worth 154.5 million
U.S. Dollars for its operations until April 1999. So far, donors
have pledged over 40 percent of that, leaving a shortfall of
57,651 tons valued at 92 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of July, WFP has delivered more than 7,800
tons of food by air and road convoy to needy Sudanese and plans
to deliver another 3,000 tons by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
The food relief agency expects to deliver up to 15,000 tons of
food each month from August and has increased its fleet of cargo
aircraft from eight to 12.

<HEADLINE> China's City to Get Award for Habitat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Once a poor fishing village,
Zhuhai, in southern China, has become a model city in the world for
comprehensive environmental management amid rapid urban growth,
the U.N. Center for Human Settlements (Habitat) announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
Zhuhai, together with other nine cities, has been selected by
an independent international jury to receive the prestigious
Dubai International Award for best practices in improving the
living environment, said the Nairobi-based Habitat.
</P>
<P>
Other nine cities are Medellin of Columbia, Cairo of Egypt,
Surat of India, Arabuko-Sokoke of Kenya, Xalapa of Mexico, Naga
City of the Philippines, Malaga of Spain, Dar-es-Salaam of
Tanzania and Kennesaw in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Best practices and the experience they embody provide a
strong building block for new policies, strategies, and even
paradigms for the effective governance and efficient management
of human settlements in the 21st century," said Jury Chairperson
Arcot Ramachandran.
</P>
<P>
According to a Habitat press release, best practices are
the initiatives undertaken by governments, local authorities and
civil society, that have made outstanding contributions to
improving the quality of life in urban and rural communities.
</P>
<P>
Most of the best practices reviewed by the jury are
contributing directly to poverty eradication, gender equity and
equality and social inclusion.
</P>
<P>
Each award winner will receive a 30,000-U.S.-Dollar prize, a
trophy and a commemorative certificate. An award-giving ceremony
will be held in Dubai to coincide with the global celebrations of
World Habitat Day on October 5.

PARIS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- France and Egypt expressed their
readiness Tuesday to replace the United States in making efforts
to revive the Middle East peace process in case Washington
mediation fails.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine and his Egyptian
counterpart Amr Moussa said at the end of their talks here that
the idea of holding an international conference on the Middle
East, proposed by President Jacques Chirac and President Hosni
Mubarak, is on the way of "concretization."
</P>
<P>
Chirac and Mubarak invited in May "all countries resolved to
saving the Middle East peace process" to join such a conference.
</P>
<P>
This proposal has been rejected by Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.

<P>
France and Egypt also said they are working in concert with the
United States and will not compete with Washington in the Middle
East.

They hinted that chances for U.S. efforts to succeed still
exist.
</P>

Tuesday, Moussa rapped the intransigent attitude held by Israeli
Prime Minister Netanyahu and said that peace should not be made on

MOSCOW, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov
decided to lift the curfew and state of emergency in Russia's
breakaway republic, the Interfax news agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The state of emergency and curfew in Chechnya was declared by

<HEADLINE> Chinese Tele-Conference On Closing Down Army's Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A Standing Committee member of the
Communist Party of China Central Committee's Political Bureau and
the Central Committee Secretariat, Hu Jintao, has said that
China's armed forces, the armed police and judicial organs need to
understand the importance of the recent decision to stop all the
businesses they run.
</P>
<P>
Hu told a tele-conference of the CPC Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection and the CPC Central Committee Political
Science and Law Committee here today that the central authorities'
decision was a major step in building the Party and the army in
the new conditions and in continuing the anti-corruption
campaign. It is also important for safeguarding the socialist
market order and the country's stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
If they engage in business, he said, the powerful army, the
armed police and law-enforcement departments could become a hotbed
of corruption. Some of their units have been involved in illegal
activities like smuggling and the sale of smuggled goods, he said.
</P>
<P>
This would certainly harm the image of the army, armed police
and law-enforcement departments, Hu said, and asked them to put
the nation's and the people's interests above anything else.
</P>
<P>
The central government says that the army, the armed police and
law-enforcement departments need to clear up their business
connections as soon as possible, and in future, should not be
involved in any commercial activities.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of the anti-corruption work in the army, the
armed police and law-enforcement departments to protect their very
nature, Hu explained.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, also a member of the Standing Committee of the
CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and Secretary of the
Central Discipline Inspection Commission, talked about discipline
and rules for the anti-corruption efforts.
</P>
<P>
The army, armed police and law-enforcement departments are
prohibited from hiding, relocating, transferring or selling
properties belonging to enterprises they run, or from distributing
funds and property belonging to firms held privately under any
name, and from making false financial reports, or rewriting,
hiding or destroying financial documents belonging to the firms,
Wei said.
</P>
<P>
He said that no employee of these companies should be
transferred to other units or promoted to higher posts and that
anyone suspected of being involved in criminal cases will be
stopped from going abroad.

<HEADLINE> Flooding In Central China: Past and Present </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 28 (Xinhua) -- At eight o'clock this morning, the
waters of the Yangtze River near the city of Wuhan rose to a
dangerous 28.8-meter high, but the 286-kilometer embankment remained
intact and the city breathed a sigh of relief.
</P>
<P>
On the very same day in 1931, the water rose to 28.3 meters,
breaching the embankment, and covering three districts of Wuhan
for more than 100 days. The disaster took the lives of 3,619
people and left 630,000 homeless.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rains of the past several months have turned the
area into one of the country's worst flooded spots. On July 25,
water levels in the large industrial center climbed to 28.3
meters, surpassing the 1931 record. On the third day, it rose
another 0.5 meter.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze, whose embankments put it above the surrounding
area, was as much as 6 meters above the downtown streets.
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly however, while the waves battered the embankments,
the city went about business as usual, and there was no price
gouging, because supplies held.
</P>
<P>
Xu Shaohua, a 58-year-old shop owner, was still at his shop near
the Wuhan Dock, with the water only 50 meters away. "I'm sure the
embankment will hold and my business has not been affected at
all," he said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
Restaurants and entertainment centers along the river remained
open and lovers strolled beneath the neon lamps as usual.
</P>
<P>
But, 67 years ago, the place where Mr. Xu's stall stands, was
in the middle of the Yangtze and the Dock's clock tower was an
island.
</P>
<P>
As the city became inundated, survivors were looking for
shelter on a few dry high spots, only to face the prospect of
wide-spread famine and disease.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers at the time wrote: "The more than 23,000 hungry
people are so miserable that people don't even dare look at them."
</P>
<P>
Huang Lizhen, who turns 84 this year, tells of a narrow escape
thanks to a boat and has a vivid memory of the past. He lives 100
meters from the embankment and believes that history will not
repeat itself.
</P>
<P>
His trust may be justified. It was only 100 kilometers long 67
year ago, but today stretches 286 kilometers, and as the water
rises, it also goes up, thanks to flood-control efforts.
</P>
<P>
Local governments have spent 560 million yuan (67 million
U.S. dollars) on the levee, increasing it from 108 kilometers in
1949 to 286 kilometers, and a 157-kilometer section is 2 meters
higher than the highest water level of 1954.
</P>
<P>
And, a reinforced concrete water-proof wall has been built in
the city.
</P>
<P>
Wang Weichun, the author of "A History of the Embankment of
Wuhan", calls the 1931 catastrophe both a natural and a man-made
calamity.
</P>
<P>
According to historical reports, when people reported to He
Chengjun, the governor of Hubei Province, that the embankment had
burst, he said, "It doesn't matter much. Just do what you see
fit," and then went back to playing mahjong.
</P>
<P>
Today, the flooding is a major concern of the central
government. President Jiang Zemin gave directions over the phone
when Wuhan was flooded on July 21, calling for an all-out efforts.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji has toured several flooded provinces and
cities and Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao came to Wuhan today when the
third flood crest passed the city.

<HEADLINE> China Needs More Biologists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- China needs to educate more
biologists for the next century, some scientists and educators say.
</P>
<P>
The 21st century is regarded as the life science century, and
today's middle school students will face the task of developing
China's biological technology, says Wu Guangyao, professor of
Beijing University's Institute of Life Science, who just returned
from Germany with four Chinese middle school students who won
three gold and one silver medal in the International Olympiad of
Biology in Germany.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time for Chinese students to win since China
began to participate in the contest in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The four prize winners have been recruited by Beijing
University and Qinghua University without being required to take
the entrance exam.
</P>
<P>
Guo Jing, one of the champion, says that she is mostly
interested in genetics and wants to study it at Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
However, scientists and educators say the contest results don't
represent the whole situation in China.
</P>
<P>
Biology is not included in the college entrance examination at
present, and Song Daxiang, president of the China Zoological
Society, says that Chinese education departments need to pay more
attention to biology.
</P>
<P>
Song says that biology textbooks in China's schools lag far
behind biological developments in the world and that middle
schools give students theory and play down experiments.
</P>
<P>
He says this is mainly because of the government's lack of
spending and the lack of good laboratories.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Zengyi, a basic education official with the Ministry of
Education, says that the ministry will increase spending on
biology teaching and build more modern labs in middle schools.
</P>
<P>
In some pilot cities like Shanghai and Guangzhou, biology will
be included in the college entrance exams again.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that some farsighted enterprises have begun
training biologists. Denmark's Novo Nordisk, which produces
insulin and industrial enzymes, has set up scholarships at Beijing
University, Qinghua University and Nankai University to help the
better students.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Young Ambassadors Work For Sino-U.S. Relations (1) by Liu Yunfei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese middle school
students left here today for the United States to make new friends
to build Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
This follows the agreement reached by President Jiang Zemin
and President Clinton on promoting people-to-people exchanges
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang said during his U.S. visit last fall that the
most important thing in bilateral relations is to enhance mutual
understanding between people.
</P>
<P>
At Beijing University earlier this month, President Clinton
told students that the younger generations of both countries not
only have the responsibility of shaping their respective futures,
but also need to contribute to the growth of the bilateral
relationship.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 Chinese youngsters, mostly coming from Beijing,
Shanghai and Hainan, will travel to Hawaii, New York, Washington
D.C., and Los Angeles to take part in two speech contests entitled
"China and the U.S. in My Eyes".
</P>
<P>
"The growth of Sino-U.S. relations in the future depends on the
youth of the two countries," says Yu Shilian, who is head of the
Chinese student delegation and serves as deputy director-general
of the Department of American and Oceanian Affairs of the Chinese
People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, an
organization for people-to-people exchanges in China.
</P>
<P>
She says that more communication between youngsters in the two
countries will undoubtedly help bilateral relations geared to the
21st century.

<HEADLINE> French FM to Visit Iran in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine will visit Iran next month in a bid to normalize troubled
bilateral ties, the French Foreign Ministry said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 15 members of the European Union (EU), including France,
cut "critical dialogue" with Iran in April 1997 after Germany
accused Iran of being involved in a murder.
</P>
<P>
"This visit comes in the process of normalization of
Franco-Iranian and European-Iranian relations," said Foreign
Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
Ties with Iran thawed when the ban on the exchange of
ministerial visits was lifted in February, following the return of
European ambassadors to Teheran, she said.
</P>
<P>
During the trip on August 22-23, Vedrine will discuss with his
Iranian counterpart Kamal Kharazi many important issues, including
the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, she said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to have a normal and global political dialogue with a
state that is extremely important, whose place is major in the
Middle East," she added.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Urged to Help Lift Sanctions Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf Tuesday reiterated the call for a unified
Arab stance on the lifting of U.N. economic sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq always calls for a stronger Arab stance to help lift this
ban, especially after Iraq (has) honored its commitments towards
the U.N. Security Council resolutions," al-Sahhaf told reporters
after meeting with Arab League chief Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Meguid.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister arrived here on Monday en route to Rabat,
Morocco, to attend a ministerial meeting of the Jerusalem
Committee of the Conference of the Islamic Organization on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf said that he exchanged views with Abdel-Meguid on
means of activating a common Arab action in seeking to lift the
"unjust" U.N. embargo.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council has imposed crippling economic
sanctions on Iraq since 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait, banning
the export of oil, Iraq's main income earner,
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, al-Sahhaf briefed Abdel-Meguid on the
relations between Baghdad and the U.N. special commission for
disarmament in Iraq, or the UNSCOM, which is in charge of
overseeing the elimination of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
He accused the UNSCOM of creating pretexts aimed at prolonging
the crippling embargo against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler last week blamed Iraq for
blocking arms inspectors' verification of its report on the
chemical and biological weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions can only be lifted after the UNSCOM
certifies that Iraq has destroyed all its nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons and long-range missiles.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Gains 3.8 Pct Economic Growth in 1st Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE July 28 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Deputy Prime Minister
Lee Hsien Loong said Tuesday evening that his country managed a
modest 3.8 percent of economic growth in the first half of this
year but the economy is continuing to decelerate.
</P>
<P>
All sectors except construction have been affected by the
regional economic crisis that continues to worsen, he said.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement at a presentation ceremony of the
International Trade Awards conferred to companies that showed
healthy performances in their businesses.
</P>
<P>
Referring trade as a sensitive indicator of the regional
problems on Singapore, the deputy prime minister said his
country's overall export in the first half of the year saw little
expansion as exports to regional economies, namely Japan, South
Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and Hong Kong, have fallen
sharply. These six economies traditionally bought almost half of
Singapore's exports.
</P>
<P>
He noted Singapore's exports to the other half of its global
market, particularly in the U.S. and EU, grew by 17 percent in the
first half compared to the first half of last year.
</P>
<P>
Lee Hsien Loong said: " our highly and globalized economy makes
us specially vulnerable to the vagaries of the external
environment."
</P>
<P>
"We are seeing more retrenchments and business reorganization
taking place this year than usual," he said.
</P>
<P>
On restructuring the service sector deemed to be affected more
severely than the manufacturing by the regional crisis, the deputy
prime minister said there is some urgency in promoting and
developing the service sector.
</P>
<P>
He said that Singapore still lags behind other hub in
significant areas despite being headquarters to over 120 trading
companies. "We are unlikely to overtake London, New York or
Frankfurt. But we should firmly position ourselves as a premier
services hub in Asia," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Food Tender Notice Angers Somalis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food
Program (WFP) published a tender notice Tuesday, angering a lot
of Somalis including the local health authorities, magistrates as
well as politicians in the capital here.
</P>
<P>
WFP has published a tender notice on all newspapers here for
the sale of 152 tons of dry pea beans unfit for the human
consumption stored in both sides of the capital and in the port
town of Merca, 100 kilometers south of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The tender notice clearly states that the buyer of the pea
beans is expected to sign a letter of indemnity absolving WFP of
any responsibility after the commodity which has an odor and was
declared unfit for human consumption is collected from the WFP
warehouses.
</P>
<P>
WFP said that the buyer must use his or her own bags for the
beans instead of using the WFP marked bags.
</P>
<P>
North Mogadishu faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed has strongly
condemned WFP for its sale of the expired pea beans to the
Somalis.
</P>
<P>
"It's a total degradation to the Somalis," said Mahdi who was
briefing the reporters in Mogadishu Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said it's unfortunate that many Somalis had recently died
of hunger following the floods and droughts that hit southern
Somalia while WFP was keeping its pea beans in the warehouses
until it became unfit to be consumed.
</P>
<P>
Mahdi blamed the aid agencies, such as WFP, on sending
poisoned relief food to the Somalis.
</P>
<P>
"WFP is even trying to avoid the responsibility by announcing
that the WFP marked bags will not be used by the buyers of the
commodity as if this responsibility will go beyond their feet,"
said Mahdi.
</P>
<P>
Mogadishu's Joint Health Authority (JHA) has strongly reacted
and condemned WFP for ignoring the health of the already
malnourished Somalis.
</P>
<P>
Osman Mohamud Dufle, the JHA coordinator, told the reporters
here Tuesday that the pea beans of WFP are neither fit for the
human being nor for the livestock as well.
</P>
<P>
The commodity is already having different fungi which endanger
the liver of the people and sometimes bring about liver cancer as
well, Dufle said.
</P>
<P>
The coordinator has called on WFP not to sell this commodity
to the Somalis who will immediately take the pea beans to the
markets for people's consumption.
</P>
<P>
"There's a total anarchy in the country," Dufle said, adding
that "if the aid agencies cannot help the Somalis, let them not
hurt us at least."
</P>
<P>
Mogadishu's health authority has also called upon WFP to
withdraw its tender notice and either to bury the pea beans or
set fire to them or else get them out of the country so as to
avoid any danger which can be traced back to the prestigious
agency, WFP which has helped thousands of Somalis.
</P>
<P>
JHA has urged the Somali businessmen not to buy the pea beans
which WFP itself had declared unfit for the human consumption.
</P>
<P>
A group of Somali magistrates led by Abdulkadir Sheikh Ma'ow
have similarly condemned WFP for its sale of the expired
commodity.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ma'ow said that WFP will still be liable despite its
meager attempts to remove all of its traces from pea beans.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ow said that it's up to WFP to find a more suitable way of
getting rid of the pea beans.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, he said, WFP won't escape the legal consequences of
any health hazards created by its tender.
</P>
<P>
The magistrates have called on WFP to cancel its tender so as
to defend the prestige it has attained during the past seven
years of civil strife among the Somalia's warring parties.

<HEADLINE> China Telecom Says AT&AMP;T-BT Deal Challenges China Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The recent deal between AT&AMP;T and
BT, two of the world's leading telecommunications companies, will
further intensify competition on the international market, a China
Telecom official said today, and that China is watching
developments closely.
</P>
<P>
AT&AMP;T and BT announced on Sunday that they will form a
10-billion-U.S.-dollar global venture that combines the
international operations and networks of the two companies.
</P>
<P>
The China Telecom official, who spoke anonymously, said that
the move marks a new trend in the competitive telecommunications
service market.
</P>
<P>
With combined international networks, the two companies can
extend services to 237 countries and link 100 cities with a
network that transmits voice and data at a rate of 200 gigabites
per second.
</P>
<P>
Both companies are major partners of China Telecom. AT&AMP;T
handles more than 50 percent of the United States' telephone
traffic with China, while BT handles over 60 percent of that
between Britain and China.
</P>
<P>
China signs a separate agreement with every foreign company
that uses the country's telecommunications network for telephone
services and fees are charged according to each agreement. China
also has its own charges on international telephone calls made
from China.
</P>
<P>
AT&AMP;T has three offices with 62 employees in China. It
cooperates with China Telecom in telephone services to and from
the U.S., and provides telephone card, tele-conference, and frame
relay services.
</P>
<P>
A China Telecom official says that although China has begun to
break up its telecommunications monopoly by setting up a second
national telecommunications company, Unicom, the country's
telecommunications service still cannot match foreign companies in
terms of quality, scale, efficiency, and cost.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Prime Minister to Reshuffle Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Prime Minister Radu
Vasile is expected to reshuffle his cabinet, merge ministries and
is also planning to make cuts, the National Monitor said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The reshuffle is expected to take place after August 15 and no
later than September 1 when the parliamentary session begins,
governmental sources were quoted by the newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that a program including urgent economic
measures will be completed By August 15 and will serve as the
ruling program for the reshuffled government.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, ministers and secretaries of state, or vice
ministers, will be scaled down in number while some ministries are
expected to merge, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Among the possible mergers are the Industry Ministry with the
Tourism Ministry, the Agriculture Ministry with the Environment
Ministry and the Transportation Ministry with Public Works and
Territorial Planning Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the council for reform will be annulled, leaving
only one ministry in charge of privatization and reform.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also plans to assign a secretary of state to
co-ordinate the privatization and reform under his direct
supervision.
</P>
<P>
Some ministers are expected to lose their portfolios in the
reshuffle, while others will be assigned as secretaries of state.
</P>
<P>
Officially, neither the government nor the coalition parties
are speaking about governmental changes, but coalition sources
said Prime Minister Radu Vasile has already contacted some
coalition parties to checkout the reaction to his plans.
</P>
<P>
The Radu Vasile cabinet came into being in April in the wake of
a three-month political crisis in Romania that culminated with the
resignation of Victor Ciorbea, Vasile's predecessor.
</P>
<P>
The government has been pressed with unpopular austerity
policies aimed at overhauling the troubled economy, which
witnessed a surge in inflation from 57 percent in 1996 to over 100
percent last year.

MANILA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang

Indonesia will soon stabilize and the country's economy get out of

"The Chinese Indonesians, as a member of the Indonesian family,
have over the years worked hard and have made important
contributions to Indonesia's economic development and social
stability," Tang said while meeting with Indonesian Foreign
Minister Ali Alatas.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers exchanged views on the relations between
their two countries and matters of mutual concern, according to a

</P>
<P>
Speaking of the riots in Indonesia in May, Tang noted that "the
unfortunate incident has aroused concern in the international
community and China has also been concerned over the matter."
</P>
<P>
He urged that the legitimate rights and interests of the
Chinese Indonesians, just as those of other citizens in the
country, should be protected by the Indonesian government.

"We hope the Indonesian government attaches importance to the
current developments and adopts earnest measures to deal with
them," Tang was quoted by the spokeswoman as saying.

Alatas said that Chinese Indonesians suffered attacks and
robberies in the social turmoil in May and the Indonesian
government regrets what happened at that time.

environment, the Arab-language daily Al Hayat reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The bank has said the shortage of potable water, lack of public
health services and pollution has led to a loss of 12 billion
liras (240 million dollars) in Syria.
</P>
<P>
It said the Syrian economy may provide more than 24 billion
Syrian liras (480 million dollars) to mobilize the necessary
financial resources for environmental protection.
</P>

The World Bank has disclosed that Syria's approval of an
enviromental plan of action will help it get international

<HEADLINE> Thai Businessman Unhappy About U.S. Judgment on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 28 (Xinhua) -- One of Thailand's leading
businessmen Tuesday called "funny" the U.S. ban on imports of Thai
shrimps in the name of the latter's inappropriate protection of
sea turtles, saying judgment must be done fairly.
</P>
<P>
"Every human being has the responsibility to protect our earth,
but no one can judge others by their own limited knowledge,"
Khemmadhat Sukondhasingha, Secretary General of the Federation of
Thai Industries, told Xinhua after the inauguration of the
Greening of Industry Network (GIN) - Asia here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said most of Thailand's exported shrimps are grown in shrimp
farms instead of fishing from the sea.
</P>
<P>
So it was "funny" that the United States launched a ban on Thai
shrimps and quoted Thailand's fishing of shrimps harming the lives
of sea turtles as the reason, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Judgment (on the environmental issues) must be done fairly,"
Khemmadhat said.
</P>
<P>
As for environmental issues in Thailand, Khemmadhat said the
country's industries, especially those heavily polluting ones,
like chemical industry, have been making efforts to address the
environment problems.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has made policies, encouraging the
industries to protect the environment. For example, the government
allows tax exemption for enterprises which import machines that
would reduce pollution, he said.
</P>
<P>
Khemmadhat joined some 250 participants from governments,
universities and non-governmental organizations (NG0s) to
celebrate the establishment of the Asian node of the GIN in
Thailand's oldest and most famous university, Chulalongkorn
University, Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1991, GIN has grown to nearly 1,500 individuals
who represent government ministries, research institutions,
corporations and NGOs from 50 countries. It is a research and
policy network that focuses on issues of industry, environment and
society.

JAKARTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI)
will create conditions conducive to the enhancement of cooperation
between the two countries, ABRI's Chief of Staff for
Socio-political Affairs Lt. Gen. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are optimistic that public order and security can be
preserved. We hope the conditions we are now promoting can support
the prospective cooperation between Indonesia and China," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting between the Indonesian Supreme Advisory
Council and Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia Chen Shiqiu here,
Yudhoyono said ABRI would take part in creating conditions
conducive to Indonesia-China bilateral ties, particularly in the
economic field, by maintaining stability, security and order.
</P>
<P>
Viewed in macro terms, he said, ABRI's stance about increased
bilateral ties between Indonesia and China was obviously to
participate in the creation of Asia-Pacific regional stability,
including cooperation among countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, ABRI's stand was also in favor of closer ties
between the two governments and the two peoples, he added.

create harmonious relations among different population groups in
Indonesia, including citizens of Chinese descend," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Russia, Britain, France and
Germany launched a global environmental monitoring program Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It is the first tangible step of the European Union-Russia
space venture since they agreed to cooperate in July last year.
</P>
<P>
The four countries, represented by the Khrunichev State
Research and Production Space Center, Matra Marconi Space and
Daimler-Benz Aerospace, signed a protocol on forming a consortium
to provide monitoring service within four or five years.
</P>
<P>
The consortium, named Global Environmental Service (GES), is
expected to provide continuous global information on environment
for governments, regional and local public decision makers, as
well as the private sectors.
</P>
<P>
Edith Cresson, European science commissioner, said the EU is
concerned about damage done by industries to the fauna and flora
as well as to public health, and would like to have as many means
as possible for observation.
</P>
<P>
She said that other European space industries can also join in
the open cooperation program.
</P>
<P>
Yuri Koptev, director-general of the Russian Space Agency,
promised that the space cooperation would get comprehensive state
assistance from the Russian side and that effective cooperation
would spill over to other industries like navigation and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Matra Marconi representative Jean-Luc Lagardere said the space
cooperation would serve as a bridge between Russia and the EU as
far as space technology expertise is concerned.
</P>
<P>
The GES, though still in the feasibility study phase, is
expected to build and launch its own satellite system, as well as
benefit from existing satellites, be it weather forecast
satellites or military ones.

<HEADLINE> Eastern Canadians Experience High Cancer Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Eastern Canadians are more likely
to develop cancer and die from it than residents of the three
westernmost provinces, a new study from Statistics Canada claims.
</P>
<P>
Cancer and mortality rates vary widely across Canada, but the
number of cancer victims is significantly lower in Canada's three
westernmost provinces -- Saskatchewan, Alberta and British
Columbia, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
There is less variation in the rate of incidence and mortality,
which is about 10 percent below the national average in
Saskatchewan and below 5 percent in British Columbia and
Alberta. Cancer among women is highest in Nova Scotia, about 7
percent above the national average.
</P>
<P>
Mortality rates from cancer are about 10 percent below the
national average for men in the three westernmost provinces. In
Nova Scotia, the rate for men is 13 to 16 percent higher than the
national average. In other eastern provinces, it is about 5
percent higher.
</P>
<P>
More men suffer from cancer nationally than women. In the study
period from 1991 to 1993, 476 new cases were diagnosed per 100,000
men, compared with 337 per 100,000 women, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The figure translates to about a 40 percent greater incidence
of cancer and a 60 percent higher mortality rate for men than
women, largely because of the difference in the rate of lung
cancer -- 89.4 cases per 100,000 men, compared with 43.2 cases per
100,000 women.
</P>
<P>
Smoking is believed to be responsible for 85 percent of all
lung cancer and perhaps 30 percent of other cancers.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 35 percent of all cancer is linked to dietary
factors, the report notes.

<HEADLINE> WWF Urges WTO to Reassess Shrimp-Turtle Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The World Wide Fund for Nature
(WWF) has called on the World Trade Organization (WTO) to reassess
its original decision on the shrimp-turtle case brought by India,
Pakistan, Malaysia and Thailand against the United States.
</P>
<P>
On July 13, the United States filed an appeal with the WTO
against its ruling that the U.S.'s discrimination of shrimp
imports caught without using turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) does
not conform to WTO trade rules.
</P>
<P>
"The seriously flawed interpretation of WTO rules by the
original shrimp-turtle panel will undermine multilateral
environmental agreements (MEAs) if allowed to stand," said Charles
Arden-Clarke, head of WWF International's Trade and Investment
Unit.
</P>
<P>
"The WTO must use this appeal to correct its lop-sided
judgement. Otherwise, it will only further shake peoples'
confidence in the world trade body," he warned.
</P>
<P>
"Unless this appeal overturns that ruling, countries that have
freely entered MEAs will be prevented by the WTO from taking
legitimate measures to protect and conserve sea turtles, and other
parts of the global commons," he said.

JIUJIANG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A few officials in east China's
Jiangxi Province have been accused of dereliction of duty in their

to check on the flood situation, and, to their surprise, found
nobody manning and patroling the embankments, and what was worse,
water had begun to run over some sections. The five officials were
the very people who were held responsible for flood control
efforts in the area.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Manufacturing Output Declines in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's manufacturing output
 declined by 0.9 percent in June from the same month last year as
higher output in the chemicals cluster was offset by declines in
the electronic and engineering clusters, the Economic Development
Board (EDB) said in a press release Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the June drop, cumulative output for the first half of
this year was 2.2 percent higher than the same period in 1997, EDB
said.
</P>
<P>
The country's manufacturing output has shrank for the second
consecutive month after May saw a 4.5 percent fall over the month
last year.
</P>
<P>
According to EDB's press release, the chemical cluster
(including petroleum, petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals and
specialty chemicals) grew by 23 percent compared to June 1997 and
the growth was contributed solely by the pharmaceuticals segment
that shot up by 108 percent with a rise in newer pharmaceutical
products.
</P>
<P>
The press release said that the output from the electronics
cluster sank by 7.1 percent as a result of lower output of
computers, disk drives, consumer electronics and telecommunication
equipment.
</P>
<P>
EDB said a combination of factors -- excess supply, declining
prices, dwindling demand, and relocation of production --
adversely affected the production of the electronics cluster.
</P>
<P>
Compared with June 1997, output of petroleum products in June
1998 declined by 2 percent and the petrochemicals industry
contracted by 1.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Output from the engineering cluster contracted by 5.2 percent
as the precision engineering segment shrank by 15.7 percent
despite a 18.6 percent rise and a 4.9 percent growth in process
engineering and transport segments respectively.
</P>
<P>
EDB attributed the contraction in the engineering cluster to
the declines in the electronics cluster that continued to depress
the output of metal and plastic precision components, tools and
dies and connectors.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM: Indian Nuke Tests Run Counter to Trend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan denounced Indian nuclear tests in May as "running counter
to the trend of the world" when he met with Deputy Chairman
Jaswant Singh of the Indian Planning Commission at the latter's
request here Monday.
</P>
<P>
In what a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman described as
"frank discussions" on the Indian nuclear explosions and
Sino-Indian ties between the two sides Monday evening, Tang said,
"India, flagrantly running counter to the world trend, conducted
the nuclear tests, thus undermining peace and stability in South
Asia and the international safeguards against nuclear
proliferation."
</P>
<P>
"It is only natural that the international community has
strongly denounced such an act," Tang was quoted by the
spokeswoman as saying.
</P>
<P>
Both Foreign Minister Tang and Deputy Chairman Singh are here
attending meetings of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and
Post-Ministerial Conference (PMC) between July 27 and 29. Their
countries are ASEAN's dialogue partners at the ARF and PMC.
</P>
<P>
"More infuriating is the fact that India, in its effort to find
an excuse for the tests, groundlessly alleged that China poses a
threat to India," the Chinese foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
"These are sheer fabrications which have poisoned the
atmosphere surrounding the Sino-Indian relations and seriously
harmed Sino-Indian ties," Tang said. "This is something that China
does not wish to see," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tang noted that the Chinese government has always followed a
foreign policy of good-neighborliness, under which it is ready to
establish and develop friendship and cooperation with all its
neighbors including India.
</P>
<P>
It is known to all that in recent years, the Chinese side has
made tremendous efforts to improve and promote relationship with
India, he said.
</P>
<P>
He held the Indian side responsible for the problems which have
cropped up in the relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"In China, we have the saying, 'A knot can be untied only by
the person who tied it'," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the Indian side respects the common aspirations of the
international community, accept and carry out the benchmarks set
forth in U.N. Security Council Resolution 1172, abandon its
nuclear weapons development plan, sign the Comprehensive Nuclear
Test Ban Treaty, join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons and take concrete actions to improve Sino-Indian
relations."
</P>
<P>
Singh at the meeting explained India's views and stressed that
his country's nuclear tests were not directed at any country,
according to the Chinese spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the Indian government's hope for better relations
with China.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Tang also met separately with Brunei Foreign
Minister Prince Mohamed Boldiah, Lao Foreign Minister Somsavat
Lengsavad and Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer Monday,
the spokeswoman said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Asks to abolish Illegal Levies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
Tuesday asked the Office of the State Minister for Investment to
abolish all kinds of illegal levies that could discourage
investments in the country.
</P>
<P>
"We should create a conducive climate for national economic
development," Habibie told a meeting between the Investment
Coordinating Board and its provincial branches at the State Palace
here.
</P>
<P>
The president asked the Office of the State Minister for
Investment to provide fresh information on business opportunities
open in the country's provinces so that they could be offered to
domestic and foreign entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
Habibie also asked the office to initiate special measures that
would bring back capital that had been taken out of the country
following unrests and prevent more capital flight.
</P>
<P>
"Capital flight indicates that our business sector has yet to
recover," he said.
</P>
<P>
On efforts to encourage businessmen to reinvest their capital,
Habibie emphasized the need to reassess the country's investment
system and introduce incentive and disincentive policies for
investments.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the biggest challenge faced by the people
and the government is how to make the wheel of economy start
turning again.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has rich natural and human resources, Habibie said,
adding that bringing in investment would restart business, secure
the supply of basic commodities, open jobs and resume national
development.
</P>
<P>
State Minister for Investment and Chairman of the Investment
Coordinating Board Hamzah Haz said investments have been low in
recent years, mainly due to the openness of the global economy as
well as the social and political unrest in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Domestic and foreign investments from April 1994 to June 1998
reached only 126.24 trillion rupiah (12.6 billion U.S. dollars),
or 56 percent of the 6th Five-Year Development Plan's (from 1994
to 1999) target of 224.70 trillion rupiah (22.4 billion dollars),

<HEADLINE> Volkswagen to Pass On Name Rights of Rolls-Royce From 2003 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Europe's largest automaker Volkswagen
AG (VW) announced Tuesday in Wolfsburg that its German rival BMW
AG would acquire the rights to the name `Rolls-Royce' beginning in
2003.
</P>
<P>
According to a memorandum of understanding between the two
German companies, VW will retain the name until the end of 2002
and then concentrate exclusively on the development, production
and distribution of Rolls-Royce's sister brand Bentley.
</P>
<P>
VW will also rename the Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd in Crewe,
northwest England, as Bentley Motor Cars Ltd after 2002.
</P>
<P>
BMW will deliver engines and components to VW's Rolls-Royce
Motor Cars subsidiary until December 2002, the documents said.
</P>
<P>
VW acquired Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd with 1.44 billion marks
(about 770 million U.S. dollars) last month, but the rights to the
name remained in the hands of Rolls Royce Plc, which had an engine
deal with BMW.
</P>
<P>
BMW will acquire the rights to the Rolls-Royce brand name from
Rolls Royce Plc and pass it on to VW for exclusive use until the
end of December 2002.
</P>
<P>
The Rolls-Royce "Silver Seraph" will continue to be produced in
Rolls-Royce's Crewe plant with BMW engine supplies. From 2003, BMW
will produce Rolls-Royce cars at a new plant.
</P>
<P>
Chiefs of the two companies and Rolls-Royce Plc will provide
more details in London on Tuesday.

<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The figure of reported HIV/AIDS
cases in China has surpassed 10,000 and all 31 Chinese provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities have been plagued, according
to the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
Total cases of HIV - human immunodeficiency virus which causes
acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) - reached 10,676 by the
end of June, including 301 fully-developed AIDS patients, the
ministry's Department of Disease Control said today.
</P>
<P>
Northwest China's Qinghai Province has no longer been "the
nation's last AIDS-free province" since some cases were found late
last month, said Xiao Yan, an official with the department.
</P>
<P>
AIDS experts fear that most of HIV/AIDS cases have not been
reported due to limited surveillance scale. "The true number may
have reached some 300,000," Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
The experts blame the rapid epidemic of the disease on rampant
drug abusing with contaminated syringes and prostitution. They
have warned that the HIV figure would rise to one million at the
beginning of the next century without immediate and effective
preventive measures.
</P>
<P>
Drug users accounted for two thirds of the infected, and
sufferers of sexually transmitted diseases and illegal blood
sellers run the increasing risk of infection, the official said.

PARIS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Two top officials of TVM, the Dutch
cycling team in the Tour de France, were placed under formal
investigation by the French authorities Tuesday for the use of the
performance-enhancing drug EPO in Reim, France.
</P>
<P>
Sporting director Cees Priem and team doctor Andrei Mikhailov
were charged because police found used drugs in their suitcase and
trash can in a search of TVM's hotel in Toulouse and Metz.
</P>
<P>
The police previously found the banned drugs in the car of one
of the team's officials in March.
</P>
<P>
The TVM issue emerged as the Festina team has already been
banned by the Tour for systematic use of EPO, the
performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
But some Festina riders are still holding on to their stands
to deny any charge of taking EPO or other illegal drugs.
</P>

Meanwhile some Festina riders continue to deny ever taking EPO

PARIS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- McLaren's appeal to overrule
Michael Schumacher's victory at the British Grand Prix was turned
down by the Formula One governing body FIA on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher drove a Ferrari first across the finish line down
the pit lane rather than on the track in the Grand Prix on July 12.
</P>

McLaren protested against Schumacher's win and claimed the

</P>

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia: Less Expatriates Allowed in Public </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Saudi cabinet has approved
regulations to reduce the number of expatriates working in
government institutions so as to give native Saudis a better
chance to get employed, Kuwait News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The regulations, approved on Monday night, came in line with a
Saudi strategy drafted on the basis of reducing the number of
non-Saudis to make room for the indigenous work force in the
government sector.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations stipulated that concluding or renewing any
contract with a non-Saudi government staff should be handled by
the highest authorities.
</P>
<P>
The new policy said an expatriate's contract with the
government should not exceed 10 years. But in case of dire need
for services of certain skilled expatriates on duty like health
sector and university staff members, an exception to this
stipulation can be made.
</P>
<P>
According to the new regulations, to renew an expatriate's
contract, the government authority should advertize for the
vacancy in local media three months prior to the required date to
ensure that no qualified local citizen wants the job.
</P>
<P>
In order to limit expatriates in the public sector, the Saudi
government adopted a five-year plan in 1995 which called for
employing 660,000 Saudis.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Iraq Exchange Remains of Dead Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Iraq on Tuesday swapped
remains of 100 Iranian and 83 Iraqi soldiers killed during the
1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, Tehran radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The exchange took place at the border point of Shalamcheh,
Iran's southwestern province of Khuzestan, the report said,
adding that the remains of Iranian soldiers were found inside
Iraq following joint search operations of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In May, the two former enemies started their joint search for
remains of dead soldiers close to their common borders. In June,
the two sides exchanged remains of 53 Iranians and 134 Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
The two countries agreed on Monday to continue their joint
search operations for those missing in actions (MIA) during the
1980-88 war.
</P>
<P>
Tehran and Baghdad have agreed to speed up their efforts to
solve the issues of MIAs and prisoners of war (POW) as they are
still the main hurdles for the two countries to normalize their
relations.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials recently announced that Iran and Iraq could
close the files of POWs within six months as the two sides showed
their sincerity in solving their issues.
</P>
<P>
But it is believed that the issue of MIAs would need more
time since the joint search operations advance slowly due to the
mines and other explosives in former battle fields in the border
areas.

<HEADLINE> Vajpayee Gov't Fails on All Fronts: Sonia Gandhi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Sonia Gandhi, president of the
Congress party, the biggest opposition party in India, Tuesday
severely attacked the BJP-led Vajpayee government for its failure
of governance on all fronts in the country since it came to power
on March 19 this year.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a mass rally here signaling the beginning of the
party's agitation against the government, Sonia Gandhi said that
the "directionless" policies of the government had caused
skyrocketing prices of essential commodities and deteriorating law
and order situation in the country, hitting the common man hard.
</P>
<P>
The government was only busy in grappling with its internal
differences and it has neither the time nor sympathy for the
helpless people, she said.
</P>
<P>
In a ten-minute fiery speech, she especially targeted the
deteriorating law and order situation and shortage of drinking
water and electricity in New Delhi, capital of India. She said,
"How can the people, who cannot even handle the affairs of the
national capital, look after the entire nation?"
</P>
<P>
The situation in the country has worsened in the recent months
with farmers in various parts of the country committing suicide
and communal tension, atrocities against women and attempts to
encroach on the rights of Dalits (lower castes in India) rising.
With the advent of the Vajpayee government the entire economic and
law and order situation in the country has worsened, she further
said.
</P>
<P>
The Congress alone could provide a progressive pro-poor and a
just government, she said adding that the party was not hungry for
power.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the rally, she marched to the Rashtrapati Bhavan
(President Palace) to submit a memorandum to the president against
the failure of the Vajpayee government.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, all opposition parties in both houses of
Parliament on Tuesday launched a scathing attack on the BJP-led
coalition government for its total failure of governance on all
fronts, especially on the law and order situation and rising
prices.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Election Draws Different Reactions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 28 (Xinhua) -- As international observers gave
a nod to Sunday's polling in Cambodia, four parties on Tuesday
refused to accept the vote result because of what they called
"irregularities."
</P>
<P>
"We have observed many irregularities in the polling, counting,
and reporting of election results," said a joint statement issued
by Prince Norodom Ranariddh's Funcinpec Party, the opposition Sam
Rainsy Party (SRP), the Cambodian Neutral Party and Son Sann Party.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot accept the result of these elections until these
irregularities have been seriously investigated and proven by
national and international observers to be nothing more than minor
technical errors," the statement said, putting into question the
election's legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) led by incumbent
Co-Premier Hun Sen was leading in votes, followed by Funcinpec and
the SRP, according to partial results announced by the Cambodian
National Election Committee (NEC).
</P>
<P>
Complete initial results would not be available until August 1,
the NEC said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, international observers monitoring Sunday's polling
and on-going vote counting said the election was "free and fair,"
fueling hopes that the election could be a success.
</P>
<P>
The Joint International Observer Group (JIOG) said in a
statement that its impression on the polling day and the counting
day was "a process which was free and fair to an extent that
enables it to reflect, in a credible way, the will of the
Cambodian people."
</P>
<P>
The statement said the assessment was based on the reports
received from the JIOG's almost 500 international observers in the
field.
</P>
<P>
"A consolidated statement will be made at a later stage, when
these observers have been debriefed after their return to Phnom
Penh and their full reports have been thoroughly analyzed," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said the reports received by the JIOG thus far "have been in
the main encouraging" and the climate on the polling day and
counting day "was peaceful and calm."
</P>
<P>
"In general, the polling achieved democratic standards and on
the day it appears that people felt able to vote without fear of
reprisal," it added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the International Observer Team led by former U.S.
Congressman Stephen Solarz and former U.S. ambassador James Lilley
also acknowledged the same impression.
</P>
<P>
They said in a statement that the voting and counting processes
"were generally well administered, and the atmosphere on the
balloting and counting days was largely peaceful and upbeat."
</P>
<P>
But the opposition SRP said in a separate statement that "it
would be terribly irresponsible for any organization to draw
conclusions on the validity of this election before a full
evaluation is completed and made public."
</P>
<P>
Prince Ranariddh reportedly complained about fraud in voting
and counting, demanding polling again in some areas, or he would
not accept the result.
</P>
<P>
The historic election, which was expected to give the nation a
chance for peace, stability and a legitimate government, saw a
voter turnout of more than 90 percent, a much higher figure than
expected.
</P>
<P>
The CPP, Funcinpec and the SRP are expected to dominate the new
National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Since not a single party will be able to win a required
two-thirds majority, or 82 seats, to form a government, a
coalition will be formed with the largest party, most likely the
CPP, naming the prime minister.

<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of local people in
Honghu City, which sits on the northern bank of Yangtze River,
worked around the clock to reinforce river dikes as the third
flood crest passed through the city on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Reports of Luoshan Hydrologic Station show that the water
level there has surpassed the record level by 0.27 m. to climb to
34.44 m. yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shunde, a 56-year-old man in Luoshan Township, said on his
way back home after a night-long hardwork at the embankment, "How
could I sleep at home when flood comes to my doorsteps."
</P>
<P>
He reviewed that the river section at Zhoujiazui faced the
danger of breach as water level rose rapidly early this
morning. Some 600 officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's
Liberation Army joined 1,500 local people and rushed to repair the
dangerous sections and brought the peril under control.
</P>
<P>
A villager is now seen positioned every 10 meter on the main
embankment of Yangtze River to keep a close watch over flood
development.
</P>
<P>
An inspection team headed by officials at various levels
conducted blanket patrol three times a day on the 135-km-long
embankment in the city, said Zhang Xinshe, a local government
official.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,000 residents in Baota Village have been evacuated to
safer places before the village was swallowed by the first flood
crest on July 3. They are living in 200 simply-built huts.
</P>
<P>
A total of 5,000 people were blocked by floods. Some live at
primary schools and others at government buildings.
</P>
<P>
A villager named Tian Shoucheng said, "We lack no confidence
though we temporarily lost our home."
</P>
<P>
Water conservancy experts say the fight against flood has
entered the crucial stage because water level at many tributaries
of the Yangtze has surpassed the record height. Moreover, there
might be more rainfalls in the region over the next few
days.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A member of the Israeli allied
South Lebanon Army (SLA) was killed Tuesday morning by a roadside
bomb in south Lebanon, the Orient radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The bomb was planted and detonated by guerrillas of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, in the Beit Yahun
village in the western sector of the Israeli occupied south
Lebanon, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
In response, Israeli artillery troops and its proxy SLA
pounded the surrounding villages, leading to the slight injury of
a 70-year-old Lebanese civilian in the Ber Ashit village.
</P>
<P>
Some civilians' houses and cars were also damaged during the
attack, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrilla cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the 2,000-strong Israeli troops and the SLA have
come under attack by Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
In addition, heavy losses the Israeli forces suffered during
the past decade have increasingly raised question in Israel about
the wisdom of maintaining troops in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In April, Israel has offered to withdraw from the region on
condition of Beirut's security guarantees for its northern borders.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and its ally Syria have rejected the offer and demanded
the Jewish state leave Lebanon without any preconditions as
stipulated in the 20-year-old U.N. Resolution 425.

NANCHANG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The water level on Poyang Lake in
east China's Jiangxi Province remained stable at 22.36 meters from
8 am to 2 pm today due to less rainfall in the past two days.
</P>
<P>
During the period, the flow rate of incoming water into the
lake dropped from 23,000 cu.m/second on Sunday to 16,500
cu.m/second currently. Meanwhile, the flow rate of outgoing water
from the lake fell from 8,400 cu.m/second to 2,000 cu.m/second,
according to the Flood Control Headquarters of Jiujiang city.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there would be no substantial rainfall in
the area in the coming two days, which will have less effect on
the water level of the Yangtze River's main streams.
</P>
<P>
However, the lake's water level is still high, with water
levels registered at four local hydrological stations rising more
than three meters above danger levels. And nearby four counties
have been partially flooded.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River's third flood crest is expected to pass the
Jiujiang River on Wednesday, where local hydrological station
recorded a water level of 22.85 meters at 2 pm, 0.06 meters higher
than six hours before. But the growth rate was dramatically lower

raise the bilateral trade volume between Bangladesh and Myanmar,
which had remained at about 8 million U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
The current volume of two-way trade and investment between the
two countries could be increased to 500 million U.S. dollars in
two to three years although it was insignificant at present,
according to BOI Director Farooq Sonban.
</P>
<P>
The MOU would create tremendous scopes of cooperation for the
private sector in the two countries, Khan was quoted by press
reports here as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar business community had expressed their interest in
establishing industries in Bangladesh using Myanmar raw materials
and Bangladesh technology. "For example, bamboo processing
industries could be set up in Bangladesh utilizing Myanmar bamboo
to produce pulp for Bangladesh paper mills," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 32-member Myanmar delegation arrived here on Sunday on a
seven-day visit to Bangladesh.

<HEADLINE> Indian Opposition Parties Criticize Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 28 (Xinhua) -- India's entire Opposition
parties Tuesday staged a noisy walkout from the ongoing session
of the Lower House of Parliament, severely criticizing the total
failure of the government especially on the law and order and
price fronts in the country.
</P>
<P>
Coinciding with the launching of President Sonia Gandhi's first
agitational program of the Congress, the biggest Opposition in the
country, here Tuesday, leader of the Opposition in the House
Sharad Pawr raised the issue during the zero hour questioning the
government's moral justification to continue in office.
</P>
<P>
The law and order situation has worsened throughout the country
and the government has failed on this front. The miseries of the
people had increased manifold ever since the BJP-led coalition
government came to power since March 19. The government had
promised stringent action against hoarders and blackmarketeers
during a special discussion on the price situation to bring prices
down but nothing has been done in this regard, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Vajpayee government's attitude was very callous towards the
people's plight and thus it had no right to continue in office, he
further said.
</P>
<P>
The Opposition in the Upper House of Parliament Tuesday also
blasted the government for what it termed as the latter's failure
to contain unbridled rise in prices of essential commodities and
attributed the inflationary trend to economic sanctions imposed
against India after it conducted nuclear tests in mid-May.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Beefs up Flood-Control Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The flood-control headquarters of
Shanghai municipality has issued an urgent call to beef up the
effort to counter floods and typhoon.
</P>
<P>
Overall, Shanghai has been sweltering hot and sunny in recent
days and there has been little precipitation. However, since the
end of the what is called the plum rain season on the traditional
Chinese lunar year calendar and particularly following July 23 and
24, there have been torrential rains and downpours, resulting in
the submerging of streets. Water has entered the homes of 2,600
families.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, the water level in Shanghai has been rising
rapidly, with the tidal levels at the upper reaches of the
Huangpu River and the lower reaches of Suzhou River exceeding
the official safety lines.
</P>
<P>
A leading official of the municipal flood-control headquarters
said that Shanghai has entered a period of frequent torrential
rains, typhoons, cyclones and hailstone.
</P>
<P>
A second round of tropical tempests or typhoon may affect
Shanghai in August or September, the official said.
</P>
<P>
These factors, when joined by floods running down to the lower
reaches of the Yangtze River, could possibly result in big
flooding in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Keen attention should be paid to weather changes and the
central control system for water drainage have to be improved, the
flood-control headquarters said.
</P>
<P>
"We should neither slack our vigilance nor be off alert for the
sake of ensuring the safety of local residents and Shanghai
economy," according to the urgent call.

<HEADLINE> Africans Urged to Rebel Against Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Africans should rebel
against political instability, coups and anything that placed the
continent in a bad light, South African Deputy President Thabo
Mbeki said in Swakopmund, Namibia Monday night.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at a dinner for delegates to the second
Southern African International Dialogue forum in the Namibian
coastal town, South African Press Association reported Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
"We must rebel against this because if something goes wrong in
Somalia, the residents Mississippi, in the United State of
America do not say something has gone wrong in Somalia... They
say something has gone wrong in Africa," he said.
</P>
<P>
Africans were mutually dependent on each other. The smart
partnership would therefore be for Africans to get together and
say it was incorrect for anybody in the continent to steal a
presidency.
</P>
<P>
"And therefore as governments, to say what is it that we can
do to ensure that that doesn't happen."
</P>
<P>
Political parties, religious leaders, trade unions and all other
sectors of society should be committed to this objective.
</P>
<P>
Because of the interdependence between African countries, it
was important that they discussed and understood the challenges
of the modern economy so that they were able to take their place
in the economy.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki called for African countries to devise ways of dealing
with the so-called YK2 problem or millennium bug, the disruption
of computer systems as their internal clock reset.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of South African Telecommunications Minister Jay
Naidoo, Mbeki announced that an Southern African Development
Community forum would be held on August 18 or 19 to discuss and
coordinate ways of addressing YK2 problems.
</P>
<P>
The venue for the forum was not announced.

<HEADLINE> Eritrean President Wraps Up Visit to Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Eritrean President Issayas Aferwerki
left here Tuesday morning for home following a two-day visit to
Egypt during which he discussed with the Egyptian leadership a
worsening border dispute in the Horn of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Aferwerki arrived Monday in the Egyptian northern resort of
Alexandria for talks with President Hosni Mubarak on the ongoing
efforts to restore peace to the Eritrean-Ethiopian border where
clashes erupted in May.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Information Minister Safwat el-Sherif told reporters
Monday that the two leaders have thoroughly thrashed out the
different aspects of the dispute and the proposed solutions to
bring it to a halt and encourage peaceful coexistence between the
two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean president, who had sent two messages to Mubarak in
June, has been seeking an active role from the Egyptian leader in
halting the developing Ethiopian-Eritrean border conflict.
</P>
<P>
But recent remarks by Egyptian officials suggested that Cairo
is not going to spearhead the mediation effort despite repeated
appeals from both sides.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the last leg of his current African tour which also
took him on Sunday to Tripoli, where he met with Libyan leader
Muammar Gaddafi on the latter's proposal for setting up a buffer
zone on the Eritrean-Ethiopian border.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Eritrean Minister of External Affairs
Haile Woldensae said in Pretoria, South Africa, on Monday that
Asmara is willing to accept unconditional ceasefire as a prelude
for initiating direct dialog with Ethiopia on their border
strife.
</P>
<P>
In a new initiative to end the Ethiopian-Eritrean dispute over a
rocky border area, the recent summit of the Organization of the
African Unity proposed for a parley between Eritrean and Ethiopian
foreign ministers in Burkina Faso on August 2.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea have accused each other of incursions
since bloody clashes broke out over a 400-square kilometer rocky
triangle of land along their western border.
</P>
<P>
The conflict deteriorated recently, dashing the hope that the
U.S.-led mediation would bring about a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea and Ethiopia, among the world's poorest, are at odds
over at least six areas along their common border. Eritrea gained
independence from Ethiopia in 1993.

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, July 28 (Xinhua) -- More than 600,000 local residents
worked hard along with soldiers and policemen today to combat
floods in east China's Anhui province, on the lower reaches of the
Yangtze River, in a joint effort to protect their homes from
surging floods.
</P>
<P>
The water level at the Anqing section of the river reached 18.3
metres by 14:00 p.m. today, 2.22 metres above the danger line,
according to local flood-control officials.
</P>
<P>
It is forecasted that the water level of the Yangtze across
Anhui Province will be the highest in more than four decades since
1954.
</P>
<P>
So far, 119 cases of emergency have been reported and spotted
along the dikes of the Yangtze in Anhui. Though the cases have
been dealt with properly, they have victimized 2.8 million local
residents with 4,600 hectares of farmland submerged.
</P>
<P>
A state of emergency has been announced by the provincial
government on Monday, with 2,000 policemen and officers and men of
the Chinese People's Liberation Army already deployed in the areas
where there are hidden dangers and great risks.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Talents come first in developing
Hong Kong into a technology center of the orient, a high-tech
investor said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Hsu Ta-lin, chairman of the venture capital firm H &AMP; Q Asia
Pacific, said that the government should tap the talents from the
Chinese mainland and abroad by giving them special immigration
treatment.
</P>
<P>
On top of the immigration relaxation, the government should set
up a public market specifically for the technology enterprises to
raise money, provide them affordable land and preferential
taxation, according to the person who heads one of Asia's largest
venture capital and private equity firms.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a luncheon co-hosted by the Chief Executive's
Commission on Innovation and Technology and the Hong Kong Venture
Capital Association, Hsu pointed out that Hong Kong enjoys many
favorable conditions in becoming the "Silicon Harbor of the
Orient."
</P>
<P>
Always proud of changing fast, Hong Kong has the
entrepreneurial spirit, well developed private and public market
financing, and good living environment, said Hsu.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the city has started the high-tech development
"in a right way" by setting up the high-level commission to advise
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa on measures to be taken to drive
forward innovation and technology developments in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Comprising 14 people and headed by Professor Chang-Lin Tien,
the commission held its first meeting on March 23. It will submit
an interim report to Tung by the end of September and conclude all
the work within 12 to 18 months.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Tourist
Association (HKTA) announced Tuesday that famed Hong Kong chefs
would feast visitors during the annual Food Festival next month.
</P>
<P>
The 16-day event starting August 8 will be organized by the
HKTA, the 13th in the annual series since 1986. This year's event
means something special as it serves as part of HKTA's desperate
efforts to boost local tourist industry at a time when Hong Kong
has been struck by the regional economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Featuring in the "mouth-watering" festival, described by HKTA
officials at a press conference here Tuesday, will be eight
programs including special culinary tours, cooking classes with
some of Hong Kong's best chefs and district-wide food festival,
street parties and the ever-popular Hong Kong waiters' race and
food bazaar.
</P>
<P>
The race, jointly organized by the HKTA and the Hong Kong
Hotels Association, is a core program of the festival and it
provides a fun-packed day featuring "Food, Excitement and
Entertainment".
</P>
<P>
The festival celebrates the cornucopia of first-class cuisine
available in the City of Life, showcasing both the overwhelming
wonder of Chinese regional cuisine and the very best of almost
everywhere else in the world.
</P>
<P>
The scores of outstanding restaurants and hotels participating
in the festival will offer special menus to mark the event,
including the award-winning ones from the previous food festivals.
</P>
<P>
"From the diversity of Chinese regional cooking to the tastes
and flavors of food from all corners of the globe, Hong Kong has
gained worldwide recognition as a dining paradise," said Douglas
Gautier, deputy director of the HKTA.
</P>
<P>
He described the event as "one of the most anticipated and
popular events on Hong Kong's calendar."

<HEADLINE> EU Backs Syria's Sovereignty Over Golan Heights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) envoy for
the Mideast peace has said that Syrian sovereignty over the
occupied Golan Heights must be restored so as to achieve a
comprehensive regional peace.
</P>
<P>
Miguel Angel Moratinos made the remarks here Monday night in
talks with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq Al-Sharaa, in which the
two officials discussed the stalled Mideast peace process due to
Israel's intransigence, the Al Baath newspaper said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks have been stalled since early
1996. The two countries have so far failed to bridge their gap
over the future of the Golan Heights captured by Israel from Syria
in the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad has said Damascus will not
resume talks with Israel unless it agreed to return the Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
In an interview Monday with Orient Radio, Moratinos said both
the U.S.and the EU are making efforts to help the process out of
the current stalemate.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks on the Palestinian-Israeli track have been
deeply stranded due to Israel's firm refusal to a U.S. proposal to
pull back its troops from 13.1 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos, who paid a one-day visit to Syria Monday, left for
Lebanon Tuesday morning for talks with Lebanese President Elias
Hrawi.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a 1,200-square-kilometer strip in southern
Lebanon, an ally of Syria, in 1985 with the claimed aim to protect
its northern areas from guerrillas cross-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> IT Plays Important Role in HK: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- An official of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region said Tuesday that information
technology (IT) definitely plays a far more important part as the
city journeys forward to the next century.
</P>
<P>
Ronald Leung, chairman of the Provisional Urban Council, made
the remarks while receiving exhibits of the "Telecom World" from
the Hongkong Telecom at the Science Museum.
</P>
<P>
Leung said that television, personal computers and mobile
phones have formed an integral part of the people's life and such
advance in the communication technology has enabled people to keep
abreast of the world within doors.
</P>
<P>
"Looking ahead, with the rapid development of global
communication and the Internet, it won't be long before the era
when people can master the jobs within doors will come," Leung
said at the brief handover ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"As Hong Kong, being a cosmopolitan city and one of the biggest
financial and cargo centers in the world, journeys forward into
the 21st century, information technology definitely plays a far
more important part. It is our wish that our next generation will
appreciate the importance of communication technology through
these exhibits."
</P>
<P>
The 100-million-HK-dollar (12.8 million-U.S-dollar) "Telecom
World" was established by Hongkong Telecom in 1995. It was divided
into seven galleries dedicated to different aspects of
telecommunications. Some 100 interactive displays, exhibits and
games offered an amazing journey to the visitors from the past to
the present and to the future of telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Plans are in hand to display these exhibits in the Science
Museum to benefit patrons to the museum by enabling them to know
more about the technology in telecommunication.

<HEADLINE> HK Removes 40-percent Ceiling on Property Lending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary Authority
(HKMA) Tuesday withdrew its "40 percent guideline", under which
banks had to limit their lending to the property sector to no more
than 40 percent of their total loans.
</P>
<P>
The HKMA announced Tuesday that it withdrew the guideline --
which was introduced in early 1994 when property lending was
soaring -- because it was less relevant to current market
conditions. The property market is no longer overheated and banks
are now much more restrained in their lending to borrowers.
</P>
<P>
"The 40 percent guideline has served its purpose and it is now
appropriate that it should be withdrawn," said David Carse, deputy
chief executive of the HKMA.
</P>
<P>
But he added: "This does not remove the need for authorized
institutions to manage prudently the risks in their property
lending." Banks should also apply prudent lending criteria, such
as the maximum 70 percent loan-to-value ratio on residential
mortgage loans.
</P>
<P>
The amount of gross new loans made in June fell slightly, so
did the average size of new loans, according to the latest
residential mortgage survey released by the HKMA Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The loan delinquency ratio, measured by the ratio of mortgage
loans overdue for more than three months to total outstanding
mortgage loans, was 0.29 percent in June. David Carse said that
figure confirmed the continuing high quality of residential
mortgage loans.

COLOMBO, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers from the South
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Tuesday ended
their two days of deliberations here on trade and economic

tensions in South Asia in the aftermath of the nuclear tests by
India and Pakistan in May.
</P>
<P>
Speculation is ripe that the upcoming summit is being
overshadowed by the worsening security situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
Under SAARC's charter, bilateral and contentious issues are
excluded from the deliberations of the grouping, but they can be
discussed informally on the fringes of SAARC meetings. Political
observers here said the nuclear issue is expected to figure
prominently at bilateral meetings of SAARC member countries,
although Kadirgamar has said the Colombo summit will focus on
economic issues.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his Indian
counterpart Atal Bihari Vajpayee are arriving in Colombo Tuesday
for the summit, and they are expected to meet on Wednesday after
the opening of the three-day summit. The leaders of the other four
SAARC members -- Bhutan, Bangladesh, the Maldives and Nepal -- are
also arriving here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Indo-Pakistani bilateral meeting, which will be the first
of its kind since the two countries carried out nuclear tests in
May, is drawing world attention.
</P>
<P>
Kadirgamar said no political issue was raised during the
foreign ministers' meeting and he insisted that SAARC's main
concern was how to speed up economic growth and social progress
and move "as fast as possible" towards greater and enhanced
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said the foreign ministers had "substantial discussions" on
a number of reports and draft guidelines on the issues of food
security, information, telecommunications, visa exemption and
SAARC's cooperation with international and other regional
organizations.
</P>
<P>
A visa exemption scheme within SAARC is expected to be
expanded, he said. Arrangements had been made for SAARC foreign
ministers' informal meeting in September in New York during this
year's United Nations General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers met during last year's U.N. General
Assembly. Such a meeting is becoming "more formal and more
structured" as they find it "very useful" when they are all in New
York for the U.N. General Assembly, he said.

<HEADLINE> Tourist Arrivals in Malaysia Fall 13 Percent in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's tourist industry
was the worst affected by the current problems with tourist
arrivals declining by 13 percent from 7.1 million in 1996 to 6.2
million in 1997, Culture, Arts and Tourism Minister Sabbaruddin
Chik said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Among the factors that affected tourist arrivals in Malaysia
were the economic slowdown, currency crisis, cholera, problems in
Malaysia-Singapore relations and negative reports by foreign
media, he said at a dialogue with tourist industry personnel
including representatives of hotels, tour companies and bus and
taxi operators here.
</P>
<P>
However Malaysia can still earn the projected 15.7 billion
ringgit (about 3.801 billion U.S. dollars) from tourism in the
year 2000 even though the expected number of tourist arrivals has
been revised from 12.5 million to 7.6 million, he told a news
conference later.
</P>
<P>
This could be done through tour packages which would provide
for longer stay in the country by foreign tourists and another
strategy would be to attract more tourists to Malaysia from the
United States, Europe and West Asia whose currencies had
appreciated against the ringgit, Sabbaruddin said.
</P>
<P>
He urged tour operators to step up their efforts to bring in
more tourists.

<HEADLINE> China Addresses Establishment of Int'l Criminal Court (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese diplomat said
today that the establishment of an international criminal court, a
long-aspired ideal and objective of international community,
represents a new attempt to reinforce cooperation in the battle
against international crime.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Foreign Minister Wang Guangya, who just returned from
Rome after leading a Chinese delegation to the United Nations
Diplomatic Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Establishment of
the International Criminal Court (ICC), provided background
information on the meeting during an exclusive interview with
Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
Wang recalled that international military tribunals in
Nuremberg and Tokyo after World War II and the two Ad Hoc
international criminal tribunals set up respectively by the UN
Security Council in the former Yugoslavia (1993) and Rwanda (1994)
were all temporary criminal courts targeted on specific issues,
rather than permanent courts featuring universality.
</P>
<P>
He described the establishment of the ICC as an outcome of the
development of the international political situation.
</P>
<P>
Wang noted that many countries carefully considered problems
surfacing in the operations of the two existing special
international tribunals and in turn advocated the institution of
a permanent international criminal judicial institution featuring
independence, justice, effectiveness and universality.
</P>
<P>
The aforementioned conference, organized by the UN General
Assembly on December 15, 1997, is expected to finalize and approve
the statute, according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
The ICC statute was passed during the conference held at the
headquarters of the UN Food and Agricultural Organization in Rome
between June 15-July 17.

<HEADLINE> China Addresses Int'l Criminal Court (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wang explained the Chinese government's attitude by noting that
China has always understood and supported the establishment of an
independent, just, effective and universal international criminal
court, which is complementary to the state judicial system and the
cooperative international criminal and judicial systems.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese delegation actively participated in the
entire negotiation process and contributed to the enactment of the
ICC statute.
</P>
<P>
The speciality of crimes ICC rules listed concerning state
judicial sovereignty prompted China to advocate caution concerning
stipulations on major issues in order to ensure the court's
independence and justice, rather than turning the court into an
organ for political struggle, or means for interfering in the
domestic affairs of any country.
</P>
<P>
The primary guideline of the ICC statute centers on the
principle of complementarity, meaning that the court should serve
as a complement of the judicial system in the respective state(s),
and the jurisdictional rights of the court should be based on the
approval of the respective state(s), according to
Wang. Irresponsible and wanton proceedings should be avoided to
greatest possible extent with regard to issues such as the
mechanisms and means of surveys.
</P>
<P>
The effectiveness and authority of the court also depends on
transparent, equal and democratic stipulations which ensure the
unniversal participation of the international community, said
Wang, adding that the statute should in no way conflict with or
contravene regulations enshrined in the United Nations Charter.

<P>
Secondly, according to Wang, the Chinese delegation harbored
great reservations regarding whether or not war crimes in armed
domestic clashes should be included in the general jurisdiction of
the Court.
</P>
<P>
The delegation held that a nation with a highly-perfected
legal system is fully capable of rendering punishment for war
crimes in armed domestic clashes, and has overwhelming
jurisdiction over the ICC when adjudicating punishment for related
crimes.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the statute's current definition on war crimes in
armed domestic clashes far exceeds stipulations in customary
international law, and the Additional Protocol II to the Geneva
Conventions, said Wang.
</P>
<P>
China has consistently advocated that a nation has the right to
either accept or reject the Court's jurisdiction over related
crimes. The current stipulation provides interim arrangements
concerning the right to accept jurisdiction, but nonetheless
rejects the principle in choice. This fact alone would cause many
countries to falter at the mention of the Court, according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the Chinese delegation held reservations concerning
stipulations regarding the functions of the United Nations
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The crime of aggression, which represents an act on the part of
a state, has not as yet been explictly defined by law. Avoiding
indiscriminate bills designed purely for political purposes
requires that the Security Council to determine the existence of
an act of aggression prior to any attempt to prosecute individuals
for criminal responsibility. Wang further noted the requirement is
clearly stipulated in the 39th Article of the UN Charter.
</P>
<P>
However, the statute fails to include clear stipulations in
this regard. Moreover, the statue sets 12-month limit on the
Security Council's right to terminate the Court operation in order
to maintain world peace and effectively perform its duties, he
said. The limit is without a doubt detrimental to the Security
Council which performs functions endowed with in the UN Charter.

<P>
Wang said that it is a pity the statute was approved by ballot
instead of a unanimity among states.
</P>
<P>
China has hoped that the statute would be passed on the basis
of unanimity reached through consultation, so that the
universality and authority of the court would be guaranteed, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Due to differences between their respective judicial systems,
participating countries were divergent on the draft statute, which
made the negotiations an arduous job, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the Chinese delegation has attended all the
negotiations and consultations, and consistently emphasized that
the statute for the ICC should reflect the reality of the world
arena and be accepted by the vast majority of states.
</P>
<P>
Wang went on to explain why China voted against the Statute,
saying that firstly, the Chinese delegation could not accept the
general jurisdiction of the ICC as the Statute stipulates.
</P>
<P>
The kind of jurisdiction is not based on the willingness of a
country to accept the Court's jurisdiction, instead, it stipulates
the responsibility of those non-contracting countries without
their agreement, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Thus, it violated the principles guiding sovereign countries,
and also did not accord with the stipulations in the Vienna
Convention on the Law of Treaties between States and International
Organizations.

<P>
Fourthly, Wang said the Chinese delegation also harbored
serious reservations to ex officio power of prosecutors in
investigations.
</P>
<P>
The power not only grants individuals, nongovernmental
organizations and various units the right to prosecute civil
servants and soldiers, but also creates the possibility that
procuratorates and courts will use the power to interfere in
internal affairs of a country.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the power of investigation will open the Court to
excessive allegations from both individuals and nongovernmental
organizations so that it can hardly dedicates both manpower and
material resources to only the world's most heinous war crimes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, procurators will face allegations resulting from the
fact that they are constantly required to make political judgments
concerning whether to investigate or prosecute. They will thus be
trapped in a political vortex which makes it impossible for them
to remain truly independent and impartial.
</P>
<P>
Finally, according to Wang, the Chinese delegation held
reservations concerning the definition of crimes against
humanity.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Chinese government's position fully accords
with customary international law which stipulate that crimes
against humanity happen in periods of war or related emergency
situations.
</P>
<P>
Existing statutes, including the Nuremberg Charter and the
Statute on the Ad Hoc International Criminal Tribunal for the
Former Yugoslavia, clearly stipulate that the related crimes are
applicable only in times of war.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Rome Statute deleted the highly important
standard for periods of war from the definition of crimes against
humanity. In addition, the list of detailed criminal offences
against humanity far exceeds customary international law and
existing laws. Many offences listed literally belong to the realm
of human rights law.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation held that international society should
refrain from forming a court of human rights, and instead focus on
a criminal court responsible for meting out punishment for those
committing the most heinous crimes in the world. With the addition
of human rights, the ICC would depart from the true goal of its
establishment.

<P>
Moreover, Wang addressed China's understanding of the status of
the Statute following approval and the nation's attitude towards
its subsequent operations.
</P>
<P>
He said the fact that the conference was compelled to vote by
ballot readily indicated the lack of a consensus. The balloting
fully demonstrated that a number of countries which are home to
over half the world's population found the statute unacceptable,
along with some permanent members of the Security Council. The
dissent will make it very hard to ensure the universality and
authority of the Statute, according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
European nations exhibited extraordinary exuberance over the
statute, with numerous reservations voiced by a large number of
Asian and Arabic nations. The ICC has thus emerged as a regional
issue, according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that many countries refrained from objecting
totally to the statute, but nonetheless clearly expressed
reservations concerning certain stipulations.
</P>
<P>
From an overall perspective, the current statute fails to take
into full account the reality of international community, fails to
address the concerns various countries have with regard to
sovereignty and security interests involving jurisdiction, and
other crucial issues surrounding the new Court.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the Chinese delegation will continue joining the
efforts of the international community to render punishment to
individuals committing the most heinous war crimes, Wang said.
China will continue to pay close attention and participate in the
the work of the ICC Preparatory Commission, apart from involving
itself in the enactment of crucial documents.

<HEADLINE> Property Rights Dispute Between Prisoner and State Company (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, July 28 (Xinhua) - China's first property rights
dispute between Plaintiff Tang Zhenqi, a prisoner, and a
state-owned real estate company enters courts in Dalian.
</P>
<P>
The country has witnessed an outbreak of property disputes
since last fall when the government expanded efforts to reform
state-owned enterprises. The 15th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China decided to clearly delineate state
property as the first step in streamlining troubled state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first case of its kind involving a prisoner
as the plaintiff," according to an official with the State
Administration of State Property. He added that the case is the
focus of attention nationwide.
</P>
<P>
"The emergence of the case indicates the deepening of economic
reform and the dramatic changes taking place in China's democratic
and legal systems," said Wu Bin, a sociologist with the Liaoning
Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The Liaoning Provincial Bureau of State Property has announced
it will consider dissolution of the case as a major breakthrough
in further delineating state property.
</P>
<P>
Tang, 49, established a real estate firm some five years
ago. However, he proceeded in line with the policy restricting
nongovernment companies from operating in the real estate market
and followed the prevailing widespread practice of subordinating
his venture to a state-owned company -- the Dalian Municipal Real
Estate Company. Over half of collective companies in Dalian have
followed the same practice.
</P>
<P>
Tang operated his business according to the guidelines and
business scope of the parent company, paid annual fees for the use
of its name and focused little attention on personal profits and
losses.

<TEXT>
<P>
Two years ago, Tang was convicted of commercial embezzlement
and sentenced to five and a half years imprisonment. The
government's new efforts to clearly delimit state property rights
last fall reminded Tang of the situation of his own company, which
he claims is still worth as much as 20 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
"The court verdict in no way deprives Tang of his property
rights, despite the fact that he is currently in prison,"
according to his attorney, Chen Dehui. "His appeal is both fair
and reasonable," said Chen.
</P>
<P>
Tang noted that his appeal is the result of the country's new
property rights policy.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the government will handle the case in
accordance with well-defined rules," said Tang.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shoupeng, an official with the Dalian State-Owned
Property Management Bureau, said the government is closely
examining the matter.
</P>
<P>
"Actual state assets will never be relinquished, and private
property will be protected," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
Chinese policies concerning the property of state-owned
enterprises stipulate that disputes will initially be handled by
government state-owned property management bureaus and not the
courts.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the increase in property rights cases in recent
months indicate the changing economic concepts of the general
public.
</P>
<P>
"While businesspeople once focused solely on their right to
profits-involving economic cooperation, they now realize the
importance for clearly defined property rights. The change
represents marked progress," according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
Experts note the delineation work will be far from easy task
since subordinate companies use the intangible assets of parent
companies, including their reputations.
</P>
<P>
"The Dalian State-Owned Property Bureau has invited economic
and legal experts to analyze Tang's case in order to ensure a
scientific and equitable decision," said Wang.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Dialogue Partners Urged to Help Restore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Foreign Secretary
Domingo Siazon opened the ASEAN's Post Ministerial Conference
(PMC) with calls to the 10 ASEAN dialogue partners to help Asia
restore economic vitality and to ensure a robust global economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to keeping their markets open, injecting new
investments and sustaining fresh financing, our dialogue partners
are urged to assume leadership in restoring economic vitality in
the region and ensuring a robust global economic growth," said
Siazon at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Siazon, who is this year's chairman of the PMC, singled out
four ASEAN major dialogue partners for their special roles in
revitalizing the Asian economy which has been battered by the
currency crisis since mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
"In particular, the United States can contribute significantly
to IMF's (International Monetary Fund) expanded capacity to
respond to financial crises by ratifying the New Arrangements to
Borrow (NAD) and the proposed quota increase in the IMF," he said.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the Japanese government to accelerate the
implementation of the fiscal stimulus package and the reform of
its financial and income tax system.
</P>
<P>
Siazon praised China for maintaining the value of the RMB which
is widely seen as the last defense against the protracted currency
turmoil still raging in the region.
</P>
<P>
"China's firm commitment to maintain the stability of the yuan
is highly appreciated, while Europe's economic strength can
reinforce the recovery in Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Siazon also urged the international community to share
responsibilities in restoring economic stability in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Considering that the financial and currency turmoil in Asia
has global roots as well as world-wide consequences, shared
international responsibility in restoring economic stability in
Asia must be recognized," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Siazon, citing the financial turmoil in Asia and the
nuclear arms race in South Asia, emphasized the need to be
ceaselessly vigilant on unpredictable events in the region.
</P>
<P>
Siazon said ASEAN will continue to cooperate with its dialogue
partners in addressing transnational concerns and social issues
such as transnational crimes and trans-boundary environmental
matters.
</P>
<P>
Among the participants attending the PMC are the foreign
ministers from the nine ASEAN member countries and the 10 ASEAN
dialogue partners.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia,
Brunei, Vietnam, Myanmar, Laos and Indonesia. The 10 ASEAN
dialogue partners are China, the United States, Russia, Japan, the
European Union, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, India and South
Korea.

<HEADLINE> PC Market Worldwide Posts Steady Growth in 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The worldwide PC industry
continues to post steady growth as shipments surpassed 21.1
million units in the second quarter, up 13.9 percent over the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Also according to the preliminary statistics from Dataquest, a
California-based market analysis firm, the U.S. market sustained a
double-digit growth, increasing by 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
"All companies were hurt to some extent by poor performance in
Asia-Pacific and Japan, and true customer demand in other regions
was masked by inventory reductions," Dataquest said in a report
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. market's growth was led by Dell, Gateway and
Hewlett-Packard, with growth ranging from 73.7 percent to 33
percent. With the merger of Compaq and Digital, the company
maintained the No.1 position, although its lead was cut
significantly. Compaq's shipments in the U.S. market reached one
million units, and its market share was 13.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, International Data Corp., another U.S. market
researcher, described the second quarter growth as "mediocre" in
the United States and worldwide PC market. According to its
statistics, total U.S. PC-vendor shipments grew 10 percent over
last year and declined one percent sequentially. Worldwide, PC
shipments rose 7 percent over the second quarter of 1997 and
declined 3 percent sequentially, as Western Europe rebounded and
the Asia-Pacific and Japan markets declined.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Countries Urged to Help Revive Asian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Thai Foreign Minister Surin
Pitsuwan Tuesday urged the international community, particularly
the industrialized countries, to contribute to the recovery of the
financial crisis-hit Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
Surin issued the call in an address at the plenary session of
the two-day ASEAN's (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Post
Ministerial Conference (PMC) which opened here Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
"A global response to the (financial) crisis is needed, not
only for Asia's recovery, but also for the stability of the global
market and health of the world economy," Surin said.
</P>
<P>
Surin said the current Asian financial crisis, whose impact on
major industrial economies has so far been modest, is "a global
problem" and will have impact on all countries.
</P>
<P>
Surin, whose country was the first to be hit by the currency
crisis last year, urged the industrial countries to help the
affected Asian countries by further opening markets and providing
them with much-needed liquidity.
</P>
<P>
Although the ASEAN economies are on their way to recovery, he
said, "there is still a great need for the industrial countries to
open their markets further for products from ASEAN to ensure that
the recovery is fueled by the strong export growth."
</P>
<P>
ASEAN hopes that the industrialized countries will continue to
stimulate domestic demand and to encourage investment in ASEAN
because of the attractive investment opportunities, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Surin also expressed the hope that the industrial countries
will help recycle capital that flowed out of ASEAN and to extend
long-term credit to the affected countries.
</P>
<P>
He praised China's firm commitment to maintaining the stability
of the RMB as an important contribution to financial stability in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Attending the PMC are the foreign ministers from the nine ASEAN
member countries -- the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, Laos,
Myanmar, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei -- and the 10
ASEAN dialogue partners.
</P>
<P>
After the plenary session, ASEAN representatives will meet
separately with each dialogue partner. The 10 ASEAN dialogue
partners are the United States, Japan, Australia, China, Canada,
South Korea, Russia, India, New Zealand and the European Union.

<HEADLINE> Stanford University to Offer Master's Degree Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Stanford, one of the leading
universities in the United States, begins this fall to offer
Internet classes leading to a master's degree in electrical
engineering, reports from the university said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"In the industrial age, we went to school. In the communication
age, the school comes to us," said Andy Dipaolo, director of
Stanford's Center for Professional Development.
</P>
<P>
Stanford officials said about 50 students are expected to be
accepted into the program by the time the virtual effort gets under
way in late September.
</P>
<P>
Most of the prospective students for the online program are
expected to be working professionals who would take three to four
years to complete their degree work.
</P>
<P>
Class handouts, notes, homework and exams all will be posted
electronically. Stanford has linked up with Microsoft and Compaq
to provide the students with state-of-the-art technology needed to
complete the courses.
</P>
<P>
Other schools such as Virginia Tech already offer online
master's degrees, but analysts noted that Stanford is the first
university among the top echelon in the United States to do so.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Jobless Rate Hits Five-Year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Israel's unemployment hit a
five-year high of 9.3 percent in May, with 210,700 people out of
work, according to the latest official figures.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment has been on rise since the beginning of the year
and there is no indication so far showing the rise trend can be
curbed soon, said a report released by the Central Bureau of
Statistics available Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said continued strong growth in the civilian labor
forces helped raise the jobless rate, which was recorded at 9.1 in
April and 8.6 in February respectively.
</P>
<P>
The labor force grew at an annual rate of 1 percent in
January-April, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli government's "failed economic policy" has been widely
held responsible for the high jobless rate.
</P>
<P>
"The terrible figures...obligate the government to immediately
change its economic policy and devote the necessary resources to
creating new jobs," Histadrut (Labor Federation) Chairman Amir
Peretz was quoted in Tuesday's Haaretz daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The unemployment problem is at the top of the treasury's list
of priorities in constructing its economic policy for 1999,"
Finance Minister Ya'acov Neeman has said.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Israel said the best way to reduce unemployment was
to cut state budget while expanding the proportion of input in
infrastructure, research and development.

PARIS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers on Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- One hundred years after its annexation by the United States,
the Caribbean island of Porto Rico will hold a referendum on whether
to become the 51st U.S. state in four months. The islanders are more
divided than ever before over their future while the growing
strength of the Spanish community is counter-balancing the ``white''
society.
</P>
<P>
-- Ten years after famine killed 250,000 people in Sudan in 1988,
two million and a half Sudanese are again threatened with death
because of hunger caused by the civil war between the Islamic
military regime and the southern Christian rebels. Humanitarian aid
agencies estimate that from 30 to 50 percent of the food sent by the
international community are being diverted from the civilians.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- In an interview with Le Figaro, German Social-Democrat leader
Gerhard Shroeder expressed full confidence in winning the general
elections to be held in September, saying that ``all conditions are
ready for the victory.'' He said that he will establish alliance
with the Greens or a big coalition with the Christian Democrats.
</P>
<P>
-- In Sudan, the soldiers are detaining food provided by the
international aid agencies to the civilians as a weapon to wage the
war. Despite the biggest food releasing operation launched by the
international community in history, some 700,000 people are dying of
hunger in the country.

<P>
CANBERRA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar struggled

BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Rainfall will subside along the

torrential rains on a larger scale, said Tang Huifang, deputy
director of the Central Meteorological Station.

"We should not relax our vigilance even if it is small amount
of rainfall because the Yangtze River has been threatened by a

<P>
Tropical storms or typhoons will not affect the river area in
the coming five days, she said, adding that her station will
follow closely the weather changes in the area as there are still
some unpredictable factors therein.

<HEADLINE> HK External Trade Decreases in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The value of Hong Kong's
re-exports, domestic exports and imports registered decreases in
June on a year-on-year basis.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed in the external trade figures for June 1998
released Tuesday by the Census and Statistics Department of Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
The value of total exports (comprising re-exports and domestic
exports) decreased by 2.0 percent in June 1998 over a year earlier
to 116.7 billion HK dollars (15 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Within this total, the value of re-exports decreased by 2.1
percent to 99.0 billion HK dollars (12.7 billion U.S. dollars),
while the value of domestic exports decreased by 1.2 percent to
17.7 billion HK dollars (2.3 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The value of imports decreased by 6.4 percent in June 1998 over
a year earlier to 123.3 billion HK dollars (15.8 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
A visible trade deficit of 6.6 billion HK dollars (0.85 billion

exports fell only moderately over a year earlier, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the visible trade deficit showed a
narrowing in the first half of 1998 compared to a year earlier, as
the value of imports fell considerably along with the moderation
in domestic demand.

<HEADLINE> Australia Welcomes China's Defense White Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Defense Ministry
Tuesday welcomed the release of China's defense White Paper,
saying it was a contribution to regional security transparency and
confidence building.
</P>
<P>
Australia had encouraged other regional countries by providing
practical assistance to issue such equivalent statements of
defense policy, a spokeswoman for Defense Minister Ian McLachlan
said.
</P>
<P>
"Senior Australian defense officials briefed China on
Australia's Strategic Policy 1997 (ASP 97) after its release, and
we look forward to discussing the new White Paper with senior
Chinese People's Liberation Army officers when they visit
Australia in August for the second annual regional security talks
between defense organizations."
</P>
<P>
"The importance of such dialogue was agreed between Ian
McLachlan, Defense Minister, and the Chinese Defense Minister
General Chi Haotian when he visited Australia in February 1998.
General Chi then advised us that a second white paper was in
preparation."
</P>
<P>
In its White Paper, released Monday, the Chinese government
outlined a defense policy based on ending Cold War mentality, with
a promise not to use growing economic might to expand its
territory.
</P>
<P>
"Even when China becomes strong and powerful in the future, it
will by no means take to the road of foreign aggression and
expansion," the State Council said in the 30,000-character paper.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Prices Down To Seven-Year Lows In U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Wheat future prices plunged
to seven-year lows on the Chicago Board of Trade on concerns about
a supply glut that would push the prices below two U.S. dollars a
bushel in coming weeks, said reports reaching here late in the day.
</P>
<P>
Wheat for September delivery, the contract closest to delivery,
fell 4.75 cents, or 1.8 percent, to 2.605 U.S. dollars a bushel,
the lowest since July 1991. December wheat fell 5 cents to 2.755
U.S. dollars a bushel.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that Egypt had purchased 250,000 metric tons
of cheaper French wheat over U.S. products, and American exporters
are struggling with ample supplies and strong competition as Asian
countries cut imports from the United States as a result of
economic troubles in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration announced plans last week to
purchase 80 million bushels of wheat that will be given away to
poor countries in a bid to boost prices. But the figure is too low
to have a serious effect on prices, said Harry Cleberg, president
and chief executive of Farmland Industries, largest U.S.
farmer-owned cooperative.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Agriculture Department estimates farmers will harvest
a total of 2.52 billion bushels of wheat this year when weak
domestic demand and export demand is now 25 percent below normal.
</P>
<P>
Cash prices are already as cheap as two U.S. dollars a bushel
in some areas and analysts say futures may also reach that
threshold in the next few weeks.

<HEADLINE> China to Reform College Entrance Exam System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Education
announced today that it will introduce trial reform into the
college entrance exam system in selected provinces in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
The reform will change the design of test questions and the
arrangement of test subjects, according to Vice-Minister of
Education Zhou Yuanqing.
</P>
<P>
The annual national exam attracts millions of Chinese young
people hoping to attend college and is one of the most important
events for every Chinese family.
</P>
<P>
A small handful of people survive the fierce competition and
eventually enter a university with an opportunity to change their
fate. Achieving the goal requires over 200 million primary and
high school students to struggle with mountains of books and test
papers.
</P>
<P>
Media and educational experts have long complained that the
creativity of students is being stifled and they are, in fact
being hurt both physically and mentally.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that the reform will introduce the "Three plus X"
method under which required subjects will include only the Chinese
language, mathematics and a foreign language, and not the five
subjects on the existing exam.
</P>
<P>
Universities will either select one or several test subjects to
supplement the three requirements, and students will choose their
favorite university and subjects.
</P>
<P>
"More freedom will be available for both the universities and
the students," said Zhou, adding the reform will be introduced
first in developed provinces such as Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
More questions will be designed to test the flexibility and
comprehensive capabilities of students, as well as their
understanding of the Chinese economy and society. This in turn
will provide fewer opportunities for students pursuing high marks
based on memorizing boring textbook materials.
</P>
<P>
However, the national unified exam will basically retain its
current form, said Zhou, adding that it will neither be divided
into several tests, nor will it be held several times, as some
people have suggested.
</P>
<P>
China's higher education exam was banned during the "Cultural
Revolution," a period which witnessed the persecution of
intellectuals. The exam was reinstated in 1977 in line with Deng
Xiaoping's instructions for respecting knowledge in order to
modernize China.
</P>
<P>
China has some 1,000 universities and colleges.

</P>
<P>
These remarks were made here Tuesday by Pakistani Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif before his departure for Colombo, Sri Lanka,
to attend the 10th Summit of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SARRC) scheduled for July 29 to 31.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said in a statement that the SAARC summit is being held
at a time of momentous development in this region.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan will be playing an active and constructive role in
the summit," he added.
</P>
<P>
The summit, according to Sharif, is likely to focus on the
consideration of the report presented by the Group of Eminent
Persons which was established by the Ninth SAARC Summit in Male
last year at Pakistan's initiative.
</P>
<P>
The Group of Eminent Persons was established to undertake a
comprehensive appraisal of SAARC with a view to further vitalizing
the association as well as on collective efforts to enhance state
and economic cooperation among the member states.
</P>
<P>
The Male summit had agreed on the idea of informal political
consultation with the objective to promote mutual trust and
confidence among the member states.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said that it will be Pakistan's endeavor that the
Colombo Summit Declaration contains sound prescriptions for
fruitful interaction among the member states in the identified
areas of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Nawaz Sharif is scheduled to meet with his Indian counterpart
Atal Bihari Vajpayee Wednesday night. It will be the first top
level encounter after the nuclear tests by the two South Asian
nations in May.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sharif said that he will pay a two-day visit to the
Maldives on July 31 after attending the SAARC summit.

<HEADLINE> CPP Leads in Cambodia's Parliamentary Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
But the NEC said the results were "temporary" and it reserved
the right to "correct the figure."
</P>
<P>
The NEC based its assessment on counting some of the ballots in
two major constituencies in eastern Cambodia, out of a total of 23.
</P>
<P>
NEC spokesman Samraing Kamsan told reporters that the NEC would
not be able to release complete initial results until August 1.
</P>
<P>
Only the NEC has the authorization to announce election results
and results released by any other party were considered "invalid,"
the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, the CPP said it had pocketed more than half of
the seats in the 122-member National Assembly in Sunday's
election.
</P>
<P>
A CPP senior official said the figure was based on what CPP
members had obtained in each counting office.
</P>
<P>
Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) said the partial results collected by
its observers late Monday showed the CPP garnered 50 seats,
followed by Prince Norodom Ranariddh's Funcinpec with 43 and SRP
with 29.
</P>
<P>
Among the 39 political parties registered in the election, the
CPP, Funcinpec and the SRP are three major contenders for
political power in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Under Cambodia's constitution, a party needs a two-thirds
majority in the National Assembly, or 82 seats, to form a
government.
</P>
<P>
If no party wins the required quorum, the new government will
be a coalition with the largest party naming the prime minister.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Power stations in China generated
some 530 billion kwh of power in the first half of this year,
according to the China National Power Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The hydropower industry contributed 88 billion, up 5.4 percent
from the 1997 period, with the output for the nuclear power
industry growing by 17 percent to 7.1 billion kwh.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the period's slower growth in power output
to relatively high winter temperatures and heavy spring and summer
rains.
</P>
<P>
The decrease in industrial power consumption during the period
was also attributed to the one to two percentage point drop in
power generation.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Students at the University
of Dar es Salaam and the Tanzania Open University have started to
receive education through satellite systems.
</P>
<P>
Under the new education program, the students are able to sit
in Dar es Salaam classrooms and attend lectures given by teachers
in the United States, Canada and Ireland, with special facilities
connected with satellite systems, Daily News said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The students can also raise questions to the lecturers, it
said.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the World Bank-funded program is only
benefiting students based in Dar es Salaam, the paper quoted the
Minister of Science, Technology and Higher Education, Jackson
Makweta, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who was tabling 1998/99 budget estimates of his
ministry at the National Assembly in the central city of Dodoma
on Monday, said that plans are underway to extend the program to
students in other areas.
</P>
<P>
He also said the ministry is preparing a bill seeking the
establishment of an institution to oversee the provision of loans
to students of higher learning institutions.
</P>
<P>
Makweta said the independent organ is necessary as the
ministry faced numerous problems in disbursing the loans.
</P>
<P>
He added a special committee has been formed to examine
problems in higher education and propose better ways of running
universities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister said institutions of higher learning
planned to increase the student intake which is too low compared
with universities in east and central Africa.
</P>
<P>
At the University of Dar es Salaam, the intake should be
increased to 9,300 in the year 2002 from 4,131 at present.
</P>
<P>
Makweta request the parliament to approve 31.1 billion
shillings (4.6 million U.S. Dollars) for the ministry's budget in
the 1998/99 fiscal year, 26.6 billion of which will be for
recurrent expenditure and the rest for development projects.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is making efforts to
include three national parks and four cultural sites into the
World Heritage List of UNESCO, Education Minister Najib Tun Razak
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The three parks are the Pahang National Park, the Kinabalu
National Park and the Gunung Mulu National Park in Sarawak while
the four cultural sites are the Bujang Valley in Kedah, Kota
Melaka (Malacca), the Niah Caves in Sarawak and the Acheh
Street-Armenian Street Enclave in Pulau Pinang, he said.
</P>
<P>
Even though Malaysia is a signatory to the Convention
Concerning The Protection of the World Cultural and Natural
Heritage, it has yet to list any site in the world list, Najib,
who is also president of the UNESCO Malaysia National Commission,
said after opening a seminar on the heritage list in Pulau Pinang,
according to the Malaysian national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
Bernama said Malaysia was expected to submit its nominations
for inclusion in the list before July 1 next year.
</P>
<P>
Najib said UNESCO's aim in having such a list was to preserve
such sites throughout the world for the benefit of humankind and
also because these places could bring income from tourism.
</P>
<P>
Noting that since the convention was ratified in 1972, the
World Heritage Committee has listed 516 heritage sites in 108
countries and regions with the list still expanding, he said there
was an imbalance in the list with more than half of the sites
listed being taken from Europe and something must be done to check
this domination.

reform. One of the main measures for the reform was to sell
stagnant state-owned enterprises in order to break their
monopoly, inject new vigor into them and enhance their
competitiveness in international and domestic markets.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, the New Zealand government has sold a
number of big firms, such as Telecom, and railway and forestry
companies.
</P>
<P>
In the wave of selling the Auckland International Airport,
conflicting opinions and suggestions have been raised on the
issues of the sales of the Wellington International Airport, the
Auckland port, and a state-owned power company.

<HEADLINE> Russia, China Share Medals in Goodwill Game Diving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Russia took the gold medals in
the men's 10-meter platform and women's 3-meter spring-board
synchronized diving while China claimed the two silvers and one
bronze at the Goodwill Games in Long Island, New York on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Russia's Dimitry Sautin won the men's gold by scoring a total
of 665.49 points, leading all the way but the second round in the
ten-round diving at the Nassau County Goodwill Games Swimming and
Diving Center Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Sautin, who also won the title of the 3-meter spring-board on
Sunday, gained three over-eighty marks with 87.36 points, the
highest in the night, in his last dive with back one and one half
somersault three and one half twists.
</P>
<P>
"You have to work hard, work, work, work and work again. That
is the simplest secret," Sautin told reporters after the
competition on the secret of his success.
</P>
<P>
The second place was moving back and forth between the two
Chinese divers, Tian Liang and Sun Shuwei. Tian, who made an
impressive dive in the ninth attempt that added him 83.52 points
to surpass his teammate Sun, claimed the silver medal.
</P>
<P>
Sun, who was in the second place from the sixth round to eighth
round, failed in the last but one round in which he just got 34.68
points. With a total of 598.80 points, he bagged the bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
In the women's 3-meter spring-board synchro diving, Russia's
Yuliya Pakhalina and Irina Lashko claimed the gold medal by edging
off the Chinese pair, Zhang Jing and Zeng Bingxuan.
</P>
<P>
The Russian girls were 1.8 points ahead of the Chinese girls
after the second round. But the Chinese beat the Russians in the
third round by 5.6 points.
</P>
<P>
However, Pakhalina and Lashko's 67.50 and 65.52 points
performances in the last two rounds made their score about 5.00
points more than the Chinese divers.
</P>
<P>
Also, the Chinese pair won the silver by just 1.08 points
advantage against the third place finisher, Germany's Conny
Schmalfuss and Simona Koch, who dived a total of 282.72 points in
the five rounds.
</P>
<P>
Eleven divers from five countries competed in the men's event
and six pairs from five nations performed in the women's synchro
Monday night. The lower place finishers were from the United
States, Mexico, and Ukraine.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Revive Economy Through Fiscal, Financial, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government will
implement a series of fiscal, financial and tax policies without
delay for the recovery of the country's faltering economy, a
senior Japanese official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the plenary session of the ASEAN's Post Ministerial
Conference, Japanese State Secretary for Foreign Affairs Masahiko
Komura said that Tokyo recognized the hastening of its economic
recovery is vital not only to its own economy but also to the
Asian and the world economies.
</P>
<P>
According to Komura, the centerpiece of the fiscal policy is a
package of Comprehensive Economic Measures under which
governmental expense will be increased by about 12 trillion yen
(90 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
As to the financial policy, he said, Japan will make
comprehensive and detailed efforts toward "aggressive disposal of
non-performing loans and the stability and revitalization of the
financial system."
</P>
<P>
Japan's Financial Supervision Agency is now inspecting the
major 19 banks, and necessary measures will be strictly taken
according to the results of the inspection, Komura said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, the government will carry out a fundamental
reform of tax systems which will include a reduction of the
effective rate of corporation tax to the international standard.
</P>
<P>
The personal income tax will be also reduced from next year as
a result of the permanent reform of the system after studying all
the points at the issue.
</P>
<P>
"In order to keep the Japanese economy truly active, it is
necessary to implement economic and other structural reforms in
many fields other than the above-mentioned fields," he said.
</P>
<P>
The international community has urged Japan to stabilize the
yen and conduct economic reforms to get the economy back on to the
growth path in order to curb the financial crisis still raging in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
The recent devaluation of the yen against the U.S. dollar has
triggered another round of currency turmoil in Southeast and East
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Komura, whose country is an ASEAN dialogue partner, and his
counterparts from the other 9 ASEAN dialogue partners are here
attending the two-day ASEAN's Post Ministerial Conference.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Iran has expressed concern about
intensification of armed conflicts in Kosovo in recent days,
calling on the international community to put an end to the
fighting, the official news agency IRNA reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said on
Monday that continued armed clashes and considerable buildup of
armed forces in the Kosovo region, along with sluggish diplomatic
efforts, have brought about a vast crisis engulfing the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that the crisis would lead to nothing but civilian
losses and homelessness of tens of thousands of local people.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said that the Serb security forces and
the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army seriously clashed last
weekend, leaving heavy casualties from both sides.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian spokesman called on international circles to pay
due attention to the need of putting an end to the current
conflicts in Kosovo as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Iran, as the current chairman of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference, urges extended international cooperation in a
bid to end the current miserable situation through diplomatic
efforts, he said.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the situation in Georgia, Mohammad expressed
regret over the failure of the third round of talks in Geneva
between representatives of Georgia and the separatist Abkhazia
region.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that discussion would continue to reach a
peaceful solution to the problem.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Weekly Office Attacked by Fire Bomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The office of the Iranian weekly
Khaneh (House) in Tehran was attacked by two unidentified persons
with a fire bomb, local daily Iran News reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The attack at Monday noon caused a minor fire, which was put
out by the occupants in the building, owned by the House of Young
Journalists (HYJ), publisher of the weekly, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The attack came after the weekly was accused of publishing a
letter from one of its readers on July 15, which was believed to
have insulted Iran's late supreme leader Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
Following the attack, the HYJ received an anonymous phone
caller threatening that it would face more serious violence
unless the weekly changes its attitude and performance.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance
immediately deplored the attack, noting that those against the
weekly's articles should pursue the matter through proper and
legal channels and refrain from taking individual action.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed official from the ministry was quoted by Iran News
as saying that this case would be considered by the press
supervisory board.
</P>
<P>
The HYJ once operated under the direct supervision of the
ministry, the official said, but it became independent in
October, 1997 following a change in the ministry's management.

He added: "But let me be blunt, the Australian government will

taking drugs in order to enhance one's performance, in order to
cheat on one's competitors -- that's exactly as I describe, it's
cheating."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Promises to Help With Asia's Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said here Tuesday that her country will continue to help
Asian countries hit by the financial crisis achieve economic
recovery.
</P>
<P>
"America's policy is clear. We call for reform, but we will
also do all we can to help countries that are being hurt by the
crisis and that are committed to reform," she said at the ASEAN
Post-Ministerial Conference Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that the international community "has both a
self interest and responsibility to help," saying American
companies have more than 130 billion U.S. dollars at stake and
U.S. economic growth has already slowed down because of the Asian
downturn.
</P>
<P>
Albright told foreign ministers from the ASEAN member countries
and dialogue partners, "Together, we represent a community of
interest and we have no greater common interest than in speeding
this region's recovery."
</P>
<P>
After citing the assistance that has been already provided to
the affected Southeast Asian countries, she said however that
official assistance can only help countries in this region get
through the worst days of the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We also have to recognize that it is not going to solve the
deeper, long-term problems they face. The crisis is not going to
be resolved by aid alone," She said.
</P>
<P>
Albright urged the affected countries to make efforts to
attract long-term committed capital back to this region, saying
foreign direct investment "offers many tangible benefits"
including providing more jobs with higher wages, making possible
advances in technology and productivity and spurring exports and
foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
"The United States is ready to work with its partners in this
region to encourage renewed direct investment in their economies,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of state also called for the resumption of
export-led growth in the region and asked industrialized countries
to keep their markets open. She expressed the hope that Japan will
"continue to move in the direction of policies that stimulate
domestic demand, restructure its banking sector and reduce
regulation of the economy."
</P>
<P>
She said her country will also cooperate with ASEAN nations in
areas such as the environment, migration and fighting drug
trafficking to enable the latter to return to economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Control Inflation Rate at 5% </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK)
is aiming at reducing the inflation rate to about five percent in
the next half of this year, a target it failed to achieve in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
Inflation remained higher than expected in the first half of
1998, despite a sustained reduction in monetary expansion, the
Daily Nation newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a six month's monetary policy statement released
Monday, the target will be made easier by the government's
success in a balanced budget in the current 1998/99 (June/July)
financial year.
</P>
<P>
Late last year, the bank predicted that inflation would remain
lower than five percent by the end of June, 1998, two points up
from last June's 4.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
"With the successful implementation of the monetary policy,
CBK will be contributing effectively to improving the economic
performance of the country," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The underlying inflation (inflation that can be controlled
through monetary policy) in the east African country assumed a
strong upward trend towards the end of June.
</P>
<P>
The underlying inflation rose to 11.3 percent in June 1998
from 4.6 percent in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
The overall month-on-month inflation, however, eased in the
second half of the 1997/98 fiscal year to 7.4 percent by June
1998, from 12.8 percent in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
CBK says the rate of inflation rose because there was less
than expected supply of goods and services following poor
economic performance in the 1997/98 year.
</P>
<P>
The CBK report said that food supply was partially affected by
wide-spread drought in the late 1996 and early 1997 and the
disruption of supplies by the El Nino related rains and floods.
</P>
<P>
"This more than offset the dampening effect of a sustained
slow monetary expansion during the year," said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report also attributed the increased inflation to the
upward adjustment of the value added tax.

<HEADLINE> China Defines Business Operations of Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Ministry of
Education said today that education is a public sector and China
will prohibit any school from using its status to earn exorbitant
profits from students.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China is currently introducing experimental
reform to allow private institutions and social organizations to
operate schools previously managed by the government.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the development of the education sector has been
hindered because of a lack of funding has prompted the government
to encourage various entities to operate schools.
</P>
<P>
Some experts predict that privatization will quickly merge with
China's education sector.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman refuted the statements. He also pointed
out that some schools operated or funded by private institutions
have charged high tuition fees to increase profits. "The practice
must be stopped," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the ministry will tightly control the number
of private schools or related institutions using private funds,
and will set ceilings on the salaries of the teachers in private
schools to make sure that they are not too higher than those of
teachers in government-run schools.
</P>
<P>
He also said the ministry will at the same time ensure the
protection of state property.

<HEADLINE> Russian Divers Claim Two Golds at Goodwill Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Russia took two gold medals in
the diving competition, while the United States claimed the
women's soccer title at the 1998 Goodwill Games here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Russia swept the final two diving top honors by winning the
men's platform and the women's 3-meter synchronized springboard.
Dmitry Sautin, the Olympic and world champion, proved he was
unbeatable in the platform, leading all the way with big margins
to collect 665.49 points.
</P>
<P>
China's Tian Liang and Sun Shuwei, who took the platform
synchronized title last week, failed to pose real threat to the
Russian. Tian collected 623.01 to finish second to Sun's 598.80.
</P>
<P>
Sautin opened with 41.76 in his first of ten dives, leading the
field with a slight gap in front of Sun's 41.28. Tian surged into
the leading position after the second round and hanging tough with
Sautin on the next two rounds.
</P>
<P>
Sautin dropped Tian for good with three straight excellent
dives on the next three outings before recording the highest score
of 87.36 to wrap up the battle.
</P>
<P>
"Sautin is still the king who reign the platform now. We have
to work hard to catch up with him," China's team leader Li Dazheng
admitted after the competition.
</P>
<P>
Irina Lashko and Yuliya Pakhalina subdued China's Zhang Jing
and Zeng Bingxuan to win the women's 3-meter synchronized
springboard with a small edge, registering 289.62 against 283.80
from the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Lashko, a mother of two who has been a world class diver during
this decade, appeared too awesome to be beaten in the race.
</P>
<P>
The Russian tandem led the first two rounds and regained the
lead in the final two dives to upset the Chinese pair on the
closing day of the diving competition. Russia and China each raked
up four gold medals out of the ten events.
</P>
<P>
The day's another gold was won by the United States women's
soccer team, who were also the Olympic champions. They beat the
Olympic runners-up China 2-0 to land the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
Mia Hamm scored twice in the second half at 66th and 87th
minutes. It was the first Goodwill Games' title for the United
States, which got its 38th consecutive victory on home soil.
</P>
<P>
"I'm satisfied with the win. China is an excellent team. The
game was a balance affair for a while, and we just had to find a
way to win," commended Tony DiCicco, head coach of the United
States team.
</P>
<P>
"One of the characteristics of this team is that we are very
mentally strong, and tonight we were able to win with some
mentally tough players."
</P>
<P>
Forward Hamm said: "This was a wonderful crowd. It was
unbelievable. It was a tremendous effort."
</P>
<P>
China's coach Ma Yuanan said: "The United States team is the
strongest squad in the world, they deserved the win. We lost to
them at the Olympics in 1996, and tonight, they beat us again. I
hope we can have a chance to meet in the final of the world
championships next year."
</P>
<P>
Boxing competition started today but no medals were produced.

<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- China basically fulfilled targets
by recovering more than 78 million tons of crude oil and 7.2
billion cu.m. of natural gas during the first six months of the
year, including both onshore and offshore production.
</P>
<P>
The figures were jointly released by the China National

</P>
<P>
China's oil industry has been hard hit by the financial turmoil
in Southeast Asia which has led to sharp reductions in
international oil prices and battered China's oil exports.
</P>
<P>
The supply of crude oil and finished oil products on the
domestic market has exceeded demand and inventories have
soared. The industry was forced to cap numerous wells during the
period.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Create Gem Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is striving to create a gem
market in the country and a system to directly sell gems abroad in
an effort to develop its gems services.
</P>
<P>
The official newspaper New Light of Myanmar Tuesday quoted
Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt, first secretary of the Myanmar
State Peace and Development Council, as saying that the government
has granted rights to local gem merchants, calling for cooperation
between the government and the merchants to share the benefits
gained.
</P>
<P>
A gem market known as the Panglong in Yangon is being
established to become a gem trade center in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar promulgated a new Gemstone Law in September 1995,
allowing local entrepreneurs to produce, transport and sell
finished gemstones and manufacture jewelry at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Before the period, the State Gems Enterprise was the sole
organization which had the rights for the activities.
</P>
<P>
In addition to allowing local private sector to mine gems in
the country, the government has also set up joint ventures with
companies from Thailand and Malaysia for the operation.
</P>
<P>
Since Myanmar's jade and gems are well known in the world, the
country holds gems emporiums annually, fetching a total of more
than 260 million U.S. dollars up to the 35th event in March this
year since 1964 when the first emporium was initiated.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the output value of Myanmar's
mining sector, which include gems and jade, rose 1.5 percent in
1997-98 fiscal year which ended in March and the production of
gems and jade in the year went to 24.7 million carats and 2.7
million kilos respectively.
</P>
<P>
The export of gems amounted to 25 million dollars in the
previous 1996-97, the statistics added.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, rich in precious stones such as gems, jade and diamond
along with other mineral resources, need capital investment and
technical know-how for the exploitation and utilization to
accelerate its economic development.
</P>
<P>
Since late 1988, three new gem lands were discovered in Myanmar
which are the Nawarat (Pyinlon), Namsa and Mongshu in addition to
the old Mogok and Mokaung.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: S. Korean Won on Rise, Exports Hurt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Further rise in the value of South
Korean won against the U.S. dollar is believed to deal a severe
blow to the nation's export if the government fails to intervene.
</P>
<P>
The won went up to 1,209 against the dollar Monday, a new high
since the country signed a deal with the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) for a rescue loan of 58 billion dollars last December.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has been swept by a financial crisis triggered by
corporate bankruptcies and bad loans of financial institutions in
late 1997.
</P>
<P>
Adding to the already worsened export climate while the nation
remains in the so-called IMF period, the strengthening won has put
enterprises on extreme nerves after two-month straight decline in
export.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said if the won keeps on the 1,200 level, it is
impossible for Seoul to hit its targeted trade surplus of 50
billion dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Export, a vital way for the nation to tide over the financial
crisis, is expecting an ever worsening climate due to the won
appreciation and banks' move to discontinue new financing amid a
whirlpool of drastic restructure in the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
Setting export prices with the won-dollar exchange rate at
1,400, exporters are also expected to suffer losses due to the
200-won gap in the foreign exchange rate. Most South Korean
companies view an exchange rate between 1,360 and 1,400 as
desirable to secure profits and upkeep competitiveness in the
international markets.
</P>
<P>
Because of the rising won, foreign buyers have consistently
asked to lower the export prices, which caused South Korean
exporters unable to maintain profitability.
</P>
<P>
A rising currency usually reflects the strength of an economy,
but it seems not the case in won's current rally.
</P>
<P>
"The won's strength is unusual in view of the economic crisis
and most Asian currencies, including the Japanese yen, remaining
weak," said an expert of the Hyundai Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
There are few signs that the South Korean economy is improving
drastically, and the nation is still struggling to carry out
reform programs, including restructuring the industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
What has pushed up the won? Analysts and economists attributed
the won surge to an abundance of the dollar on the market stemmed
from an increasing current account surplus and shrinking demand
for the dollar amid corporate and financial restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Some economists also attributed it to the rescheduling of
short-term debts into long-term ones, which resulted in the
reduction of immediate demand for the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign exchange reserve reached a record high of
38.9 billion dollars on July 15. The current account surplus stood
at 23 billion dollars as a result of the trade surplus in the
first half of 1998, and foreign currency deposits at financial
institutions rose up to 11 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
More dollars are expected to flow into South Korea as
foreigners have begun to buy out or merge local companies.
</P>
<P>
Exporters, who are worried about their competitiveness, have
pushed the government to move ahead of the won' further rise.
</P>
<P>
They have alleged that they will lose their competitive edge if
the won remains below 1,300 level. A survey by the Korea
International Trade Association described a 1,380 level as
"appropriate."
</P>
<P>
However, some economists have expressed different views. They
said it would be beneficial for the won to further appreciate.
The Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade pointed to
1,150 as the optimal won-dollar exchange rate and said a strong
won will reduce the costs of imports.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the government, which had banned buying the
greenback for speculative purpose since last November, allowed
customers to buy dollars without proving that they need the
currency on actual demand.
</P>
<P>
It is not yet clear whether the government will directly
intervene in the foreign exchange market, although it said it will
leave the won's fate to the market force.
</P>
<P>
However, most observers predicted that the government will
directly intervene the foreign exchange market, as the United
States and Japan did in joint efforts to slow the yen depreciation
last month.

<HEADLINE> Meeting in U.S. City on Geographic Information System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Projected to be indispensable
in the 21st century, a type of information technology is drawing
over 8,000 specialists around the world to southern California.
</P>
<P>
At the focus of the annual conference starting Monday in San
Diego is geographic information system, or GIS, with pervasiveness
predicted by the organizers to be just as the Internet is today.
</P>
<P>
GIS is a computer-based tool integrating common database
operations, such as query and statistical analysis, with the
visualization and geographic analysis offered by maps.
</P>
<P>
It is used to map and analyze things and events on earth.
</P>
<P>
What makes San Diego, the second largest city in California,
standing out to host the five-day GIS event is its status as one
of the pioneers in the United States in applying the technology.
</P>
<P>
The city and county of San Diego since 1984 have developed a
system using a computerized base map to locate 832,300 assessor's
parcels, 35,700 street lights, 501 schools, 64 eagle nests, etc.
</P>
<P>
Currently with 50 gigabytes of information, equivalent to the
storage of 90 CD-ROMs, such a GIS system produces maps for area
planners, utility crews, budget analysts and private industries.
</P>
<P>
Over years, San Diego has spent 12 million U.S. dollars to
collect and standardize the geographic data, plus millions more on
annual basis to update local governments' information files.
</P>
<P>
The uses of GIS varies. San Diego city water crews, for
instance, can pinpoint a pipeline break on a digitized map on
their laptop computers, make repairs and download the record of
the repair into the city mainframe computer for future reference.
</P>
<P>
Now at some World Wide Web sites on the Internet, the vast
computer network accessible worldwide, mapping services are
available to point out the best driving route between two places.
</P>
<P>
As for the future, GIS researchers imagine that it will soon be
possible, via the Internet, to call up a map, locate a specific
property, download a photo and even watch a video showing people
and vehicles outside a certain building.
</P>
<P>
Combined with signals transmitted from global positioning
system (GPS) satellites, it might eventually be possible to
geocode any person or article and local it within seconds.

<HEADLINE> Indian Airlines Face Negative 5 Percent Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The recession in the domestic
aviation industry is set to worsen with the industry heading for a
negative growth in 1998-99 fiscal year (April 1 1998-March 31
1999), The Economic Times said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The sluggish economy in the country is showing no sign of an
immediate revival and the writing on the wall is clear to the
domestic aviation industry. All major operators are now resigned
to a negative five percent growth in passenger traffic in 1998-99
against the eight percent growth in passenger traffic projected
for the fiscal year, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Every airline has experienced a 10-15 percent drop in seat
factor. They witnessed a seat factor of little over 60 percent
during traditional peak season for tourist travel in May and June.
Alliance Air Managing Director Vinoo Kashyap said the situation
was quite bleak and the coming months do not hold any promise.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Shows Concern About Yangtze Flooding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), has shown great
concern about the flooding along the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Early this morning, the NPC chairman, who is also a Standing
Committee member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of
China Central Committee, called the State Flood Control and
Drought Relief Headquarters in Beijing, asking about the details
of the flooding along the river, China's longest, and about the
protection of the main stream, Dongting and Poyang lakes along it.
</P>
<P>
He was very much concerned about flood control efforts in
Wuhan, a central China hub and capital of Hubei Province, and
Jiujiang city of Jiangxi Province at the middle reaches of the
river in particular.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he also asked about the flooding of the Songhua
and Nenjiang rivers in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng showed great concern about the armymen and civilians
fighting the current flooding. He called on all the localities to
strictly follow China's Law on Flood Control as well as
instructions from President Jiang Zemin in fighting the flooding,
and win the success in their fight against the flooding under

<HEADLINE> Thailand Focuses on Social Issues in 5th IMF Letter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will focus on social
issues especially the mounting unemployment problems in its fifth
letter of intent to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a
government source said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda also
said that Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai was very concerned about
the employment situation and wanted it included in the fifth
letter of intent to the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The number of unemployed people in Thailand surged after the
financial crisis broke out last July. In the first six months of
this year, jobless people have already exceeded two million, a
number the government estimated for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
In view of the worsening situation, the Finance Ministry has
prepared several measures to help ease the problems, including
debt restructuring for troubled businesses, Tarrin informed.
</P>
<P>
If the measures succeeded, businesses would continue and staff
would be able to keep their jobs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has also been trying to solve
unemployment problems by injecting five billion baht (125 million
U.S. dollars) into a social safety net program to train some
750,000 skilled labor nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The government was also pushing for a deficit budget for fiscal
1999 in its letter of intent to the IMF so that more money can be
diverted into the labor sector, the source said.
</P>
<P>
According to Tarrin, the fifth letter of intent will also touch
on education, public health and the agricultural sector.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's exports are expected to
amount to 5.5 billion U.S. dollars in the first seven months of
the year, a 7.3 percent increase over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Imports could reach 6.9 billion dollars, a 1.9 percent increase,
said a report released by the General Department of Statistics on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry of trade said the export growth in the first seven
months of 1998 was at a four-year low compared with figures in
previous periods.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis in Asia is blamed for Vietnam's export
slowdown, for 70 percent of the country's exports are to Southeast
Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's exports to Japan, South Korea and other Southeast
Asian countries have declined markedly as these countries were
severely hit by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has decided to revise downward several economic targets
for 1998. The targeted export growth for 1998 now has been cut to
10 percent from the original 23 percent. This amounts to about 10
billion dollars.

<P>
NEW YORK, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States won the women's
soccer crown at the Goodwill Games here Monday night, beating
China 2-0 in the final.
</P>
<P>
The heroin of the U.S. team was the young and veteran striker
Mia Hamm, who in the 66th minute blasted the ball home from a
dozen meters off the left post after receiving a pass from
midfielder Kristine Lilly.
</P>
<P>
About 20 minutes later, Mia, described later by the Chinese
goalie Zhao Yan as an "exceptional player," scored again from 35
meters.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team, with the retirement of a few key players this
year, showed some weakness in cooperation and defense. The new
goal keeper Zhao Yan did an excellent job and saved a number of
goals during the first half of the match.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese women's soccer proved their strength today, although
we lost to a very strong American team," said Chinese coach Ma
Yuanan.
</P>
<P>
He said that China had two very good opportunities but lacked
finishing power.
</P>
<P>
The Americans took good advantage of their chances, he said,
adding that he was pretty pleased with the performance of his team.
</P>
<P>
For the past few years, the two teams met in a number of
international games, with the United States winning the most
matches.
</P>
<P>
Norway carried home the bronze medal after winning the penalty
kick shoot-out 4-2 against Denmark earlier in the evening. Their
final scores were 5-3. The two teams had tied 1-1 in regulation
time.
</P>
<P>
All these four women teams qualified for the World Cup to be
held in the United States next year.
</P>
<P>
The final match Monday night drew an attendance of 11,307, a
record size in the Goodwill Games history.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM Optimistic Over Situation in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan said here Tuesday that peace and development remain the
mainstream of the times and that dialogue and cooperation the
common aspiration of all countries.
</P>
<P>
In a statement at the annual ASEAN Post-Ministerial Conference
(PMC) here Tuesday morning, Tang noted that "the situation in this
region and the world at large has undergone profound changes"
since the PMC last year.
</P>
<P>
However, he said destabilizing factors are also on the
increase.
</P>
<P>
"Under the impact of the financial storm, the situation in Asia
has become volatile, the momentum of development characterized by
fast economic growth and relative political stability has suffered
setbacks and the efforts to maintain economic security face
unprecedented challenges."
</P>
<P>
But he described the economic woes facing Asian countries as
difficulties on the way of progress, saying whether Asia can
deliver itself from the difficult position depends on various
factors, both internal and external. "A comprehensive analysis of
various conditions gives us every reason to be fully confident in
the future development of Asia."
</P>
<P>
Despite the strong impact of the financial crisis, he said, the
foundation for Asia's development is not seriously damaged and the
economic fundamentals remain sound.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he pointed out that in challenges lie
opportunities. In an effort to address their economic problems,
Asian countries are restructuring their economies, changing the
mode of growth, improving the financial regulatory system and
promoting scientific and technological progress.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister described the market potentials
of East Asia and the rest of Asia as "far from being tapped,"
which he said is "a most favorable factor in ensuring continued
economic growth in Asia."
</P>
<P>
He praised the fine cultural tradition which the Asian people
have created over their long history, such as esteem for
self-respect and self-improvement, hard work and plain living,
diligence and thrift, modesty and studiousness and dedication to
the community and the collective.
</P>
<P>
He declared that Asian countries will be able to bring back
vigor and vitality to their economic development, as long as they
carry on these cultural traditions while drawing upon advanced
achievements of the world civilization in the process of
integrating themselves with the trend of the times.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the recovery and development of the Asian
economy also depend on a favorable external environment. "It
should be noted that the financial crisis in East Asia broke out
against a background of economic globalization, the globalization
of the financial market in particular, even though it does have
something to do with Asia's internal factors."
</P>
<P>
He said the crisis has not only raised a new subject for the
developing countries in their integration with the world economy,
but also posed a new challenge to the work of maintaining the
security of the global economic and financial systems.

<P>
COLOMBO, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Prime Minister
Sirimavo Bandaranaike Tuesday said cooperation among South Asian
countries is needed to solve the common problems affecting the
progress and development of the SAARC region.
</P>
<P>
In a message on the occasion of the 10th South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) summit which opens in
Colombo tomorrow, the prime minister said that this is all the
more necessary because problems relating to South Asian countries
are similar in nature.
</P>
<P>
She said that some South Asian countries, which are among the
poor nations of the world, are faced with the problems of rapid
population growth, scarcity of food, diseases and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, a number of other sensitive problems have arisen.
The ethnic problem is one of them. These problems have become so
disastrous as to give rise to internal strife and armed
struggles," the message said.
</P>
<P>
"The increasing complexities of these problems has inevitably
led to a sharp deterioration in the quality of human life in the
region," the prime minister pointed out.
</P>
<P>
She said they should not forget that there were invisible
forces responsible for this state of affairs.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister urged that the SAARC countries should act
with a sense of mutual trust and understanding to make a
cooperative effort to overcome these problems.
</P>
<P>
She believed that through mutual cooperation most problems
could be solved.

<P>
BRASILIA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Brazil decided to lift price
controls Monday on what refineries may charge distributors, and
opened up oil imports to companies other than the state-run oil
company, Petrobras.
</P>
<P>
The decision was signed by Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso and will be effective Wednesday. It was expected
to have an immediate impact on prices at the pump.
</P>
<P>
In November 1995, the Brazilian Congress approved a
constitutional amendment on ending Petrobras' 40-year monopoly on
oil production, refining and importing oil. But the government
only recently began to allow other oil companies to operate in
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Almost all oil refined in Brazil comes from Petrobras'
refineries, and has been sold at the set price of 0.34 reals (0.31
U.S. dollars) regardless of prices on the world market.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The financial crisis in East Asia
will not slow down the pace of China's reform and opening-up, nor
has it done so, Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In his statement at the ASEAN Post-Ministerial Conference,
which opened its annual meeting here Tuesday morning, Tang said
that as a member of Asia, China is speeding up its efforts to
build a socialist market economic system and bring about a
fundamental change in the mode of economic growth, with a view to
keeping a sustained, rapid and sound development of the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
"A China enjoying political stability, economic growth and
social progress will not only benefit its 1.2 billion people, but
also continue to make important contribution to stability and
prosperity of Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Chinese government "has adopted a highly
responsible attitude in facing up to the challenge of the East
Asian financial crisis."
</P>
<P>
While working to expand domestic demand to boost its economic
growth, he said, China persists in not devaluing its currency, the
RMB, thus making a positive contribution to stabilizing the
regional economy.
</P>
<P>
China has also contributed about 4 billion U.S. dollars as aid
to the Operational Budget of the IMF and has also provided
assistance within its capability to the countries concerned
through bilateral channels.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that China will, as always, pull together with the
East Asian countries in times of trouble and continue its efforts
toward easing off the financial crisis in East Asia.

the social side effects of the economic crisis have still not
reached their peak, but we do remain confident in ASEAN," he said
in his statement.
</P>
<P>
Since its foundation in 1967, ASEAN has overcome several other
crises and weathered the winds of change, Schussel said. Despite
the present economic and political difficulties, ASEAN will
continue to fulfill its essential function of promoting
cooperation and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We are positive that at the end of this process of economic
and global adjustment, ASEAN will emerge as a stronger and even
more coherent regional grouping prepared to face the tasks for the
21st century," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the EU is willing to provide technical assistance
to help ASEAN survive the current financial crisis if requested to
do so.
</P>

Schussel said that the EU hopes to increase its cooperation in
all relevant fields with its ASEAN partners, including the ASEAN
Free Trade Area, the ASEAN Industrial Cooperation, the ASEAN
Investment Agreement and other cooperative projects.

<HEADLINE> Full Text of Chinese FM's Statement at ASEAN PMC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan made a statement at the ASEAN Post-Ministerial Conference
(PMC) here Tuesday and the following is the full text of the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Chairman,
</P>
<P>
It is a significant event for ASEAN and its dialogue partners
to meet here today to exchange views on regional and in
international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The situation in this region and the world at large has
undergone profound changes since the last PMC. An overview of the
situation shows that peace and development remain the mainstream
of the times and that dialogue and cooperation the common
aspiration of all countries. The overall situation is good.
</P>
<P>
It is true that destabilizing factors are also on the increase,
among which the financial crisis in East Asia is the most salient.
The ferocity with which the crisis broke out, its extensive scale
and severe consequences went beyond our expectation. Under the
impact of the financial storm, the situation in Asia has become
volatile, the momentum of development characterized by fast
economic growth and relative political stability has suffered
setbacks and the efforts to maintain economic security face
unprecedented challenges.
</P>
<P>
How will Asia extricate itself from the predicament? what are
Asia's prospects of development? These are the concerns not only
of the Asian countries, but also of the world.
</P>
<P>
As is the rule of development of all things, the economic
development of a country, region or even the whole world cannot be
plain sailing. It is only natural and inevitable that Asia has
experienced twists and turns and ups and downs in its development
process. Despite their severity, Asia's difficulties are those on
the way of progress. Whether Asia can deliver itself from the
difficult position depends on various factors, both internal and
external. A comprehensive analysis of various conditions gives us
every reason to be fully confident in the future development of
Asia.
</P>
<P>
First, there still exist fundamental conditions and favorable
factors for Asia's economic growth. Generally speaking, a solid
foundation has been laid for the Asian economy thanks to its fast
growth over the years. Despite the strong impact of the financial
crisis, the foundation for Asia's development is not seriously
damaged and the economic fundamentals remain sound. The
traditional advantages, such as good education, a high savings
rate and rich human resources, continue to play a role.
</P>
<P>
Second, in challenges lie opportunities. With a view to
addressing the problems and obstacles in the economic development,
Asian countries are restructuring their economies, changing the
mode of growth, improving the financial regulatory system and
promoting scientific and technological progress. Although the
Asian economy will stay at a low ebb for a period of time, it will
not be very long before it regains its vitality provided Asian
countries adhere to effective practices, formulate development
strategies suited to their national conditions and conduct
necessary reforms in the course of its integration with the world
economy.
</P>
<P>
Third, the market potentials of East Asia and the rest of Asia
are far from being tapped, which is a most favorable factor in
ensuring continued economic growth in Asia. The differences in the
development stages of the Asian economies and the living standards
will give an impetus to a progressive and level-by-level
development of the Asian market, thus forming a rational market
structure. There exists a sustainable energy for the development
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, the most crucial is the invaluable spiritual wealth
Asia has for its development. That is the fine cultural tradition
which the Asian people have created through practice over their
long history, such as esteem for self-respect and
self-improvement, hard work and plain living, diligence and
thrift, modesty and studiousness, and dedication to the community
and the collective. Asian countries will be able to bring back
vigor and vitality to their economic development, as long as they
carry on and practice these cultural traditions and wisdom with
oriental characteristics and draw upon advanced achievements of
the world civilization in the light of their national conditions
in the process of integrating themselves with the trend of the
times.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the recovery and development of the Asian economy
also depend on a favorable external environment. It should be
noted that the financial crisis in East Asia broke out against a
background of economic globalization, the globalization of the
financial market in particular, even though it does have something
to do with Asia's internal factors. Therefore, it is far from
being a traditional crisis in one region, but rather a crisis of a
new type in the course of the evolution of the world economic
system. It has not only raised a new subject for the developing
countries in their integration with the world economy, but also
posed a new challenge to the work of maintaining the security of
the global economic and financial systems.

<HEADLINE> Qian Says Positive Results Achieved in Caribbean Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KINGSTON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen,
who ended his five-Caribbean-nation tour on Monday, said his tour
has achieved positive and desired results.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Qian said that he reached
broad consensus on bilateral relations and international affairs
with leaders of the five countries he visited -- Barbados, Guyana,
Trinidad and Tobago, Cuba and Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
China and the five nations pledged to continue their efforts to
push bilateral relations to a new level, Qian said when referring
his meetings with the leaders.
</P>
<P>
During the trip, China signed separate agreements on economic
and technology cooperation, mutual protection of investments,
mutual exemption of visas and other cooperation agreements with
the countries.
</P>
<P>
The peoples of China and the five countries enjoyed profound
traditional friendship, Qian said. He said he is satisfied with
the smooth development of bilateral relations and trade and
economic cooperation since China's establishment of diplomatic
ties with these countries.
</P>
<P>
On the international stage, China and the five nations
cooperate well and are mutually reliable friends, Qian told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said the governments of the five nations all reiterated
their one-China policy. They also expressed opposition to the
so-called return of Taiwan to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Qian stressed that unity and cooperation with other developing
countries has always been one of the basic points of China's
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
He said his country and the Caribbean nations are all
developing countries, sharing similar historical backgrounds and
facing the common task of promoting economic development and
raising living standard of the people, though the countries
differed in size, population, social systems and ideology.
</P>
<P>
The future for cooperation between China and these countries is
bright, said Qian. The two sides have common interests, and in
particular, their economies are complementary.
</P>
<P>
As a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council
and a friend of the Caribbean, China is willing to work together
with the governments in the region to bring a long-term stable
relationship into the 21st century under the guidance of the three
principles: equal treatment and support for each other, increasing
contacts and enhanced friendship, expanding cooperation and
building a future together, said Qian.
</P>
<P>
A few countries in the region haven't yet established
diplomatic relations with China. The only obstacle to the
realization of normal relations between China and them is the
question of Taiwan, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government is willing to build and develop
normal relations with these countries on the basis of the five
principles of co-existence. It welcomes peoples in the countries
to visit China to promote mutual understanding and exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Qian said he believed that these countries will comply with the
trend of history and established diplomatic ties with China in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Qian started his visit, the first such one, to the five
Caribbean countries on July 18. His first stop was Barbados.

<HEADLINE> Full Text of Chinese FM's Statement at ASEAN PMC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since the eruption of the financial crisis in East Asia, the
international community has provided support and assistance to
East Asian countries, especially to those severely-affected. This
should be affirmed. However, uncertainties still linger on as to
whether there can be a favorable external environment for the
economic recovery of Asian countries. Over-speculation by
international hot money poses a new challenge to the economic
security of all countries, the developing ones in particular.
Defects in the international financial system restrain the efforts
of the international community to resolve the risks of
globalization. The Japanese economic recession and the fluctuation
of the exchange rate of the yen have exerted additional pressure
on the Asian economic recovery. Moreover, it is necessary to give
serious consideration to the question of whether or not the
specific national conditions of the developing countries can be
fully respected and the negative impact of the bailout programs
alleviated. In short, while competition is undoubtedly necessary
in the process of economic globalization, cooperation should be
enhanced all the more. Only coordination and cooperation are the
best choice. The developed countries which play a pivotal role in
the world economy should, in particular, undertake their
responsibilities and obligations and create favorable conditions
for the economic recovery in Asia.
</P>
<P>
All in all, Asia continues to have a bright future although the
road is tortuous. Through joint efforts, the Asian people will
surely be able to create a better tomorrow in the next century.
Asia, either politically or economically, will be a crucial force
in the new world pattern that is taking shape.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Chairman,
</P>
<P>
As a member of Asia, China, in line with its grand
cross-century blueprint, is speeding up its efforts to build a
socialist market economic system and bring about a fundamental
change in the mode of economic growth, with a view to keeping a
sustained, rapid and sound development of the national economy.
The financial crisis in East Asia will not slow down the pace of
China's reform and opening-up, nor has it done so. A China
enjoying political stability, economic growth and social progress
will not only benefit its 1.2 billion people, but also continue to
make important contribution to stability and prosperity of Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has adopted a highly responsible
attitude in facing up to the challenge of the East Asian financial
crisis. While working to expand domestic demand to boost its
economic growth, China persists in not devaluing the RMB, thus
making a positive contribution to stabilizing the regional
economy. China has contributed about 4 billion U.S. dollars as aid
to the Operational Budget of the IMF and has also provided
assistance within its capability to the countries concerned
through bilateral channels. China will, as always, pull together
with the East Asian countries in times of trouble and continue its
efforts toward easing off the financial crisis in East Asia.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Dialogue Partners Urged to Help Restore Asia's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Foreign Secretary
Domingo Siazon opened the ASEAN's Post Ministerial Conference
(PMC) with calls to the 10 ASEAN dialogue partners to help Asia
restore economic vitality and to ensure a robust global economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to keeping their markets open, injecting new
investments and sustaining fresh financing, our dialogue partners
are urged to assume leadership in restoring economic vitality in
the region and ensuring a robust global economic growth," said
Siazon at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Siazon, who is this year's chairman of the PMC, singled out
four ASEAN major dialogue partners for their special roles in
revitalizing the Asian economy which has been battered by the
currency crisis since early 1997.
</P>
<P>
"In particular, the United States can contribute significantly
to IMF's (International Monetary Fund) expanded capacity to
respond to financial crises by ratifying the New Arrangements to
Borrow (NAD) and the proposed quota increase in the IMF," he said.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the Japanese government to accelerate the
implementation of the fiscal stimulus package and the reform of
its financial and income tax system.
</P>
<P>
Siazon praised China for maintaining the value of the RMB which
is widely seen as the last defense against the protracted currency
turmoil still raging in the region.
</P>
<P>
"China's firm commitment to maintain the stability of the yuan
is highly appreciated, while Europe's economic strength can
reinforce the recovery in Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Siazon also urged the international community to share
responsibilities in restoring economic stability in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Considering that the financial and currency turmoil in Asia
has global roots as well as world-wide consequences, shared
international responsibility in restoring economic stability in
Asia must be recognized," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Siazon, citing the financial turmoil in Asia and the
nuclear arms race in South Asia, emphasized the need to be
ceaselessly vigilant on unpredictable events in the region.
</P>
<P>
Siazon said ASEAN will continue to cooperate with its dialogue
partners in addressing transnational concerns and social issues
such as transnational crimes and trans-boundary environmental
matters.
</P>
<P>
Among the participants attending the PMC are the foreign
ministers from the nine ASEAN member countries and the 10 ASEAN
dialogue partners, including Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia,
Brunei, Vietnam, Myanmar, Laos and Indonesia. The 10 ASEAN
dialogue partners are China, the United States, Russia, Japan, the
European Union, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, India and South
Korea.

<HEADLINE> Number of Thai Generals Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The number of generals in the
three armed forces of Thailand has dropped from 2,000 in September
last year to 1,859 in April this year, the Bangkok Post reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Of those remaining generals, 616 are in inactive posts, the
newspaper quoted a Defense Ministry source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The drop resulted from a policy proposed by Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai, who is also the Defense Minister, of replacing only
75 percent of retired generals from the Defense Ministry, the
Supreme Command and the three armed forces.
</P>
<P>
According to the source, Chuan had asked the three armed forces
to appoint new generals "only in extremely necessary cases" in a
forth-coming military reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also suggested a major-general or a
lieutenant-general take three to five years instead of one to two
years to be eligible for promotion, the source said.

<HEADLINE> Austrian Miner Rescued After Stuck Underground for Nine Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- An Austrian miner trapped in a
collapsed mine for nine days was brought to the surface on Sunday
and was miraculously in good health.
</P>
<P>
Austrian television reports said Georg Hainzl, 24, was pulled
up from 60 meters down in a magnesium silicate mine at Lassing,
220 kilometers southwest of Vienna.
</P>
<P>
As shown on the television, He was then taken to a hospital in
Graz, about 200 kilometers southwest of the capital.
</P>
<P>
"It is the miracle of Lassing," provincial governor Waltraut
Klasnic said, while Austrian President Thomas Klestil hailed it a
"victory for hope" and thanked rescue workers for their efforts.
</P>
<P>
Hainzl was trapped on July 17 after a mudslide filled the
mine. It was Austria's worst post-war mining disaster.
</P>
<P>
Officials had given up all hope that Hainzl and 10 other
trapped miners could be alive.
</P>
<P>
The other 10 miners were buried in a second mudslide that
struck when they entered the pit in an attempt to rescue Hainzl.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are continuing to find these 10 miners, but there
appeared practically no hope for them.

<HEADLINE> Albania Protests Over Alleged Yugoslavia Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian Foreign Ministry on
Monday presented a note to Yugoslavia protesting about what it
called the "threat posed against Albania's sovereignty and
integrity of territory."
</P>
<P>
The note, presented to the Yugoslav Charge d'Affaires in
Albania, protested about the alleged firing by Yugoslavian
frontier guards at the Kukes area on Albania's side of the border
with Kosovo, early on Sunday morning. The note said it posed a
direct threat to Albania's sovereignty and integrity of territory.
</P>
<P>
Sources in Albania's ministry of internal affairs said the
firing lasted about 15 minutes. It left bullet holes on buildings
and forced women and children of some villages to move away.
</P>
<P>
The note said Yugoslavia's act could lead to undesirable
results, and demanded that authorities involved stop this kind of
offense immediately, and promise no such events would happen again.
</P>
<P>
Until now there have been no reports of Yugoslavia's reaction
to the protest.
</P>
<P>
As the Kosovo crisis accelerates, incidents on the
Albania-Yugoslavia border have increased. But so far there have
been no direct clashes between the two country's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, seven members of the so-called Kosovo Liberation
Army (KLA) were killed in a clash on the border between Yugoslavia
and Albania, reported Yugoslav news agency Tanjug.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the media center in the provincial capital
Pristina was quoted as saying the ethnic Albanian separatists were
killed by Yugoslav border guards in a cross-fire while attempting
to flee to neighboring Albania.
</P>
<P>
Bloodsheds and casualties occurred constantly over the past
days since the Serbian security force intensified its offensives
to drive KLA rebels out from the troubled province of the Republic
of Serbia, in the Yugoslav Federation.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade says troops are deployed in securing the bordering
area, and therefore the military was not involved in the fighting
between security forces and ethnic Albanian guerrillas inside
Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Number of Child Prostitutes in Thailand Determined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BANGKOK, July 28 (Xinhua) -- In an attempt to end the
decade-old debate over the number of child prostitutes in
Thailand, The Public Welfare Department of the Thai government
announced Monday that only 17,978 people below 18 years of age
were working in the sex trade, not 800,000 as named by some
children's right groups, the Bangkok Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The analysis of previous studies held by several government
and non-government organizations concluded that at any time in
1997 there were 90,916 sex workers in Thailand, 50,636 of whom had
started at an early age.
</P>
<P>
Of the 17,978 child prostitutes, 5,510 are children from
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The department's director-general Irawat Chantharaprasert was
quoted by the Bangkok Post as saying that he would propose to the
Thai Cabinet and Foreign Ministry to use the number as the
official figure in order to end "misleading speculation by the
foreign media which uses it to attack Thailand."

<HEADLINE> Thai Economy seen contracting 8.5 percent This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Thai economy is expected to
contract by 8.5 percent this year before it recovers to expand a
marginal 0.2 percent in 1999, Bangkok Bank said in a research
report available Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the baht is forecasted to move in the range
between 40 baht and 43 baht against the U.S. dollar in the second
half of this year while long-term interest rates are expected not
to decline higher than one percentage point despite the expected
fall of the short-term rate.
</P>
<P>
"the baht movement also depends on other regional currencies
as the baht would be hit if volatility renews," the said.
</P>
<P>
The bank expected that the Thai recession, tight liquidity and
a sharp decline in consumer demand would likely restrain inflation
to about 7.7 percent in 1999 after a projected 10.4 percent
increase in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that expected foreign capital inflows as well as
a bigger fiscal deficit would help stimulate the economy next year
due to further investment and rising private spending.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the country's 1999 trade account in baht terms would
post a 5.8 percent surplus of GDP while the current account is
also expected to record a surplus for the second straight year in
1999 of 4.9 percent of GDP against an expected 5.2 percent surplus
in 1998.

<HEADLINE> International Observers: Cambodian Election "Free and Fair" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 28 (Xinhua) -- International observers
monitoring the Cambodian election said late Monday that Sunday's
voting was "free and fair," fueling hopes that the election could
be a success.
</P>
<P>
The Join International Observer Group (JIOG) Cambodians said in
a statement that "it is the impression of the JIOG that what could
be observed by us on polling day and counting day was a process
which was free and fair to an extent that enables it to reflect,
in a credible way, the will of the Cambodian people."
</P>
<P>
The statement said the assessment was based on the reports
received from the JIOG's almost 500 international observers in the
field.
</P>
<P>
"A consolidated statement will be made at a later stage, when
these observers have been debriefed after their return to Phnom
Penh and their full reports have been thoroughly analyzed," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said the reports received by the JIOG thus far "have been,
in the main, encouraging" and the climate on polling day and
counting day "was peaceful and calm."
</P>
<P>
"In general, the polling achieved democratic standards and on
the day it appears that people felt able to vote without fear of
reprisal," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Cambodians went to polls en masse on Sunday to vote in historic
elections that were expected to give the country a second chance
for peace, stability and a legitimate government.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian National Election Committee (NEC) reported a
massive voter turnout of more than 90 percent, a much higher
figure than expected.
</P>
<P>
The JIOG's statement said the atmosphere and procedures of the
polling day and counting day, arranged by the Cambodians
themselves, "represent a major achievement and step forward
compared with similar circumstances during the 1993 Cambodian
parliamentary elections."
</P>
<P>
"No serious cases of violence have been reported, nor, at this
stage, any serious irregularities that could have a significant
effect the integrity of the voting process," the statement said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Europe to Try Harder for Middle East Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima
said here on Monday that the European Union would exert more
efforts to push forward the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The progress in the peace process will also be necessary for
the security of Europe, Klima said at a joint press conference
with visiting Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Austria currently holds the rotating EU presidency, and Arafat
arrived Monday on a one-day visit to the capital, Vienna, where he
met with Klima, President Thomas Klestil, and Speaker of
Parliament Heinz Fischer.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to make clear that the EU will proceed in a
coordinated way with the United States. We hope that the political
expression of the international community will help to ensure that
the U.S. initiative can also be quickly accepted by Israel," the
chancellor said.
</P>
<P>
Klima reiterated that recognition of the Palestinian rights to
self-determination is a basic policy for Austria and the EU. They
supported the United Nations General Assembly's decision to
upgrade the Palestinian status.
</P>
<P>
Austria would press the EU to continue with a program of
financial aid for the Palestinians, Klima added.
</P>
<P>
Yasser Arafat asked the European Union to increase pressure on
Israel to agree to U.S. proposals on returning more West Bank land
to Palestinian rule.
</P>
<P>
"We need European and American pressure to get Israel to the
negotiating table," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat welcomed a proposal by Egypt and France to hold a new
international conference on the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
After his meetings in Vienna, Arafat was to go to Paris to meet
with French President Jacques Chirac.

<HEADLINE> Specialist Explains Reasons For Yangtze's Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese specialist speaks about
the river's "stomach" when talking about its middle and lower
reaches and about how they're just too small to hold the large
volume of water from the upper reaches and the tributaries in the
middle and lower reaches.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shengfu, a senior engineer of the Yangtze River Water
Conservation Committee, said that in the past, the river's
complicated geological conditions, ant holes, or different
embankment structures have all been used as evidence of the
devastating floods that have continued to visit it in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
He warned that disasters can occur whenever the "stomach erupts
because of eating too much."
</P>
<P>
Rains have caused serious flooding over the whole Yangtze Basin
for the fourth time this decade, the second largest flood since
1954, he says.
</P>
<P>
The 6,300-km Yangtze is China's longest river and is known as a
"cradle" of Chinese civilization, along with the Yellow River, the
second longest.
</P>
<P>
In the past 200 years, there has been one devastating flood
recorded every 10 years. The 1931 deluge affected nearly 30
million people, took the lives of more than 140,000, and destroyed
more than 200,000 ha. of farmland.
</P>
<P>
In 1954, flooding affected the lives of more than 10 million
people and left 30,000 dead.
</P>
<P>
For the past several decades, the government and people have
done a great deal to reinforce dikes and dams along the gigantic
river, but its ability to withstand floods is still not good
enough, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The accumulation of mud in the river and its tributaries has
reduced its capacity to hold the overflow, he pointed out, and the
large lakes along the river have been shrinking and small ones
disappearing.
</P>
<P>
Dongting Lake, for instance, has shrunk from over 6,000
sq.km. in 1825 to less than 2,700 sq.km..
</P>
<P>
In Hubei Province, the number of lakes declined from 1,332 in
the early '50s to 843 in the '80s, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that flooding in the Yangtze Basin, which is one of
the most developed areas in the country, can cause tremendous
losses, even when they are not major floods and even though there
may not be a large number of people killed.

<P>
CANBERRA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The West Australian state
government threatened to sue International Swimming Federation
(FINA) for 1.25 million U.S. dollars for a financial shortfall
from the world championships.
</P>
<P>
FINA signed on as underwriters to the event in Perth but the
January event failed to attract the level of sponsorship
anticipated by the state government, Sport Minister Norman Moore
said in Perth on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Moore and Australian Swimming, which was negotiating with FINA
on the state government's behalf, have written to FINA's Bureau
members requesting the payment.
</P>
<P>
"Legal action will arise if they don't pay the money," Moore
said.
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that FINA underwrote that money and we're
calling on that to be honored."

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Seven members of the so-called
Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) were killed Monday in a clash on the
border between Yugoslavia and Albania, reported Yugoslav news
agency Tanjug.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the media center in the provincial capital
Pristina was quoted as saying the KLA members were killed by
Yugoslav border guards in a cross-fire while attempting to flee to
neighboring Albania.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Yugoslav military said Monday
night that during the weekend, there were "many terrorist
attacks...on (Yugoslav army) watchtowers, supply convoys and
barracks."
</P>
<P>
An officer and two soldiers were killed and five soldiers were
wounded in the crashes, a statement said.
</P>
<P>
Bloodsheds and casualties occurred constantly over the past
days since the Serbian security force intensified its offensives
to drive KLA rebels out from the troubled province of the Republic
of Serbia, in the Yugoslav Federation.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade says troops are deployed in securing the bordering
area, and therefore the military was not involved in the fighting
between security forces and ethnic Albanian guerrillas inside
Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> China Willing to Build Stable Relations With Jamaica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KINGSTON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen
on Monday conveyed to Jamaican leaders China's wish for long-term
stable relations of cooperation with Jamaica in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Highly praising the friendship between Jamaica and China,
Governor-General Howard Cooke said his country is willing to
actively push forward bilateral cooperation in all areas.
</P>
<P>
Qian, here since Saturday, expressed his appreciation at the
contribution made by Cooke in pushing ahead Sino-Jamaica relations.
</P>
<P>
In a separate meeting with Qian, Prime Minister Percival
Patterson said Jamaica and China have been constantly expanding
their relations since mutual diplomatic recognition 26 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the number of high-level visits to each other is
increasing, Patterson said Jamaica is expecting to continue the
cooperation in international affairs and bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Qian praised the increasingly bigger role Jamaica is playing in
the Caribbean and in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Patterson is scheduled to visit China later this year. Qian
said he believed the planned visit will help promote the relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Qian and Seymour Mullings, deputy prime
minister and minister of foreign affairs and trade, discussed
bilateral ties and international issues at the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Mullings thanked the Chinese government and people for their
assistance and other help over the past years, hoping that
cooperation between his country and China will be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Qian told Mullings that it is in the fundamental interests of
the peoples of both countries to improve contacts, increase
understanding, develop friendship and expand cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed appreciation at the one-China policy upheld
by the Jamaican government and its efforts in pushing forward the
relations between China and other Caribbean countries.
</P>
<P>
With a good political relationship and the desire to cooperate,
Qian said, the Chinese government is willing to search for new
ways and areas for cooperation with Jamaica on the basis of
treating each other as equals.
</P>
<P>
China and Jamaica share common or similar views on many
international issues, said Qian, adding Jamaica is an important
country in the Caribbean region.
</P>
<P>
The Group of Fifteen (G-15) African, Caribbean and Pacific
nations will hold its 9th summit in Jamaica next year. Qian said
China supports Jamaica's efforts to promote regional integration.
</P>
<P>
With the globalization of world economy and the integration of
regional economies, it would help boost their power as a whole for
the Caribbean countries to work together and speak in one voice.
</P>
<P>
Jamaica is the last stop of the Chinese vice-premier's
five-Caribbean-nation tour, which has already taken him to
Barbados, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, and Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Specialist Explains Reasons For Yangtze's Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese specialist speaks about
the river's "stomach" when talking about its middle and lower
reaches and about how they're just too small to hold the large
volume of water from the upper reaches and the tributaries in the
middle and lower reaches.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shengfu, a senior engineer of the Yangtze River Water
Conservation Committee, said that in the past, the river's
complicated geological conditions, ant holes, or different
embankment structures have all been used as evidence of the
devastating floods that have continued to visit it in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
He warned that disasters can occur whenever the "stomach erupts
because of eating too much."
</P>
<P>
Rains have caused serious flooding over the whole Yangtze Basin
for the fourth time this decade, the second largest flood since
1954, he says.
</P>
<P>
The 6,300-km Yangtze is China's longest river and is known as a
"cradle" of Chinese civilization, along with the Yellow River, the
second longest.
</P>
<P>
In the past 200 years, there has been one devastating flood
recorded every 10 years. The 1931 deluge affected nearly 30
million people, took the lives of more than 140,000, and destroyed
more than 200,000 ha. of farmland.
</P>
<P>
In 1954, flooding affected the lives of more than 10 million
people and left 30,000 dead.
</P>
<P>
For the past several decades, the government and people have
done a great deal to reinforce dikes and dams along the gigantic
river, but its ability to withstand floods is still not good
enough, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The accumulation of mud in the river and its tributaries has
reduced its capacity to hold the overflow, he pointed out, and the
large lakes along the river have been shrinking and small ones
disappearing.
</P>
<P>
Dongting Lake, for instance, has shrunk from over 6,000
sq.km. in 1825 to less than 2,700 sq.km..
</P>
<P>
In Hubei Province, the number of lakes declined from 1,332 in
the early '50s to 843 in the '80s, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that flooding in the Yangtze Basin, which is one of
the most developed areas in the country, can cause tremendous
losses, even when they are not major floods and even though there
may not be a large number of people killed.

<HEADLINE> Merapi Volcano May Erupt Again in Near Future, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's most active volcano
Mt. Merapi may erupt again in the near future due to magma
pressure from the volcano's core, Antara News Agency Tuesday
quoted a volcanology official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The possibility was necessitating the maintenance of alertness
among residents of areas around the mountain in Central Java, head
of the Center for Research and Development of Volcanic Technology
Mas Ace Purbawinata said.
</P>
<P>
Merapi erupted on July 11, spilling out hot fumes and ashes and
its conditions have prompted local authorities to maintain a
"Merapi alert" state of readiness. The alert status meant that
people living near the mountain had to be prepared to move to
safer places any time.
</P>
<P>
So far, the alert status of Merapi was not being changed
despite the fact that it is frequently emitting clouds of hot gas
to as high as 5,000 meters above the mountain's peak.
</P>
<P>
Merapi's activity entered a critical phase on July 19 as it
spewed out clouds of hot gas as high as 8,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
Residents around the volcano reported thick dust falling on
their villages with some closest to the peak saying the dust had
reached a thickness of one centimeter.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people living in the volcano's vicinity have been
suffering from respiratory illness and eye disorders caused by
volcanic ash rains that fell almost every days, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Merapi, 2,968-meter high and one the most active volcanoes in
Indonesia, last erupted in November 1994, killing at least 60
people.
</P>
<P>
Merapi's most destructive eruption this century was in 1930,
when 1,300 people were killed.

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Canadian Dollar Slides to New Lows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 27 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian dollar continued its slide
on Monday, dropping a new record low close of 66.51 U.S. cents on the
North American market.
</P>
<P>
The loonie also set a new trading low against the U.S. dollar,
reaching 66.43 U.S. cents in the afternoon trading, according to
reports here.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two weeks, the currency has set a series of record
low closes.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian dollar is expected to dive further to 66 U.S. cents by
the end of the week unless the Bank of Canada raises interest rates,
the reports said.
</P>
<P>
So far, the central bank has resisted the call for the interest
hikes, especially at a time when the Canadian economy is showing signs
of slowing down.
</P>
<P>
Until the Asian financial picture improves, the Canadian dollars
will remain under constant pressure, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The reason is that the Canadian economy still depends on exports of
oil, gas, forest and other commodities, whose prices have been soft as
a result of the Asian crisis, they added.

<HEADLINE> Stanford Offers Master's Degree Completely Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Stanford University in northern
California this fall will become the first major research university
in the United States to offer a master's degree totally online.
</P>
<P>
The new online program will offer 30 courses leading to a master's
degree in electrical engineering. Students are not required to go to
campus at all.
</P>
<P>
For 30 years, Stanford's School of Engineering has offered graduate
engineering degree programs, non-credit courses, certificate programs,
seminars and short courses to distance learners at some 300 companies
using a combination of microwave, videotape, satellite and two-way
digital video technology.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, the Stanford Center for Professional Development (SCPD)
has been experimenting with delivery of courses via the Internet.
After a project demonstrated the demand for on-line access among
working professionals, SCPD established Stanford Online to deliver
courses to the desktop of the distance learner. The service already
offers Stanford credit for a variety of on-line courses, but until
now, there have not been enough on-line offerings to allow a student
to obtain an advanced degree in this fashion.
</P>
<P>
"In the industrial age we went to school. In the communication age
the school comes to us," SCPD director Andy DiPaolo said. "Through
Stanford Online we intend to prove this concept by making a portion of
the graduate engineering curriculum available to qualified students
anywhere, anytime and on-demand."
</P>
<P>
About 50 students are expected to be accepted into the program. As
most of them will be working professionals, they are expected to take
three to four years to complete their degree work. Typically, a
master's degree candidate needs only a year or so.
</P>
<P>
The university said that it has linked up with Microsoft and Compaq
to provide the master's degree candidates with state-of-the-art
communications technology.
</P>
<P>
When judged by test scores, Stanford said, studies have shown there
is little or no difference between the performance of distance
learners and on-campus students.

<HEADLINE> Food Delivery to Southern Sudanese Hampered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Food delivery by
international relief agencies to 1.2 million people in southern
Sudan is hampered by heavy rains and lack of roads, the U.S.
State Department said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
James Rubin, spokesman for the State Department, said
distribution problems remain "significant and genuine" because
of a "horrific situation."
</P>
<P>
The 1.2 million people in southern Sudan need 9,500 tons of
food per month. The U.N.-sponsored relief effort known as
Operation Lifeline has increased its heavy-lift air fleet from
two to 11 and has added three new air bases in the area, Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from that, barges have also been used but with limited
success, he said, adding that there are numerous problems with
proposals for using a rail line from Khartoum to southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
"We are doing what we can do in a horrific situation to
support the Sudan peace talks, because ultimately it is only
peace that can break the cycle of famine that has been so
prevalent in Sudan," Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> China: UN Reform Is a Matter Concerning Entire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Addressing the U.N. Economic and Social Council, Chinese
Deputy Representative to the United Nations Sheng Guofang said
consensus reached on relevant issues only after extensive
discussions with the participation of the member states can
withstand the test of time.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Sheng said with regard to the subsidiary bodies which
have really been inefficient and have failed to play their due
role, it is not adequate to eliminate them or incorporate
them into some other bodies.
</P>
<P>
Sheng said doubled efforts should be designed to reach the targets
and concrete measures be taken for improvement so as to
achieve the objective of ensuring the fundamental institutional
balance of the U.N. on one hand, and enhancing role and efficiency
of the relevant bodies on the other.
</P>
<P>
Sheng said the reform of the United Nations is a process, and
time should be allowed for new reform measures be tested in the
process of actual implementation, so that member states can
objectively sum up experiences and decide on the best future
courses of action on this basis.
</P>
<P>
Sheng said adoption of reform measures is only a first step
in the efforts to achieve the objectives of revitalizing the
role of the U.N. in the economic and social fields. Without
adequate resources, no reform plan will achieve this objective.

from a gunman.
</P>
<P>
"They died saving lives, they died doing their duty," said
Representative Tom DeLay, whose office was a site of the gunfight
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"It was a death in the family," Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott said following a moment of silence in the chamber in memory
of Jacob Chestnut, 58, and John Gibson, 42.
</P>
<P>
The man accused of killing the two officers, Russell E. Weston
Jr., 41, of Rimini, Montana, had his case moved to federal court
Monday afternoon. Weston, who authorities said has a history of
mental illness, will continue to be held without bond until he is
able to appear for a hearing.
</P>
<P>
Weston was charged with one count of killing a federal officer.
Additional charges are pending. He could face the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at D.C. General Hospital Monday upgraded Weston's
condition to stable but said they remained concerned about his
heart and the possibility of blood clots.
</P>
<P>
On the Capitol Hill, the House passed a resolution Monday
formally allowing the use of the Capitol Rotunda for a memorial
service for the slain officers, authorizing a plaque to honor the
two men, and agreeing to pay their funeral expenses. The Senate is
expected to follow suit later in the day.
</P>
<P>
A Rotunda ceremony is an honor usually reserved for presidents
and national heroes. Speakers at the memorial ceremony for the two
officers will include President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al
Gore, House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Lott. The coffins will lie
in the Rotunda from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Both chambers also are scheduled to consider another resolution
honoring the two officers.
</P>
<P>
In Albuquerque, New Mexico, Clinton opened a national Social
Security forum Monday morning with a moment of silent prayer for
the two officers and their families.
</P>
<P>
Gibson will be buried Thursday after a funeral in suburban Lake
Ridge, Virginia.
</P>
<P>
At the Capitol Hill, security was heightened, with additional
police officers stationed on the Capitol grounds, at entrances to
the building and throughout its corridors.
</P>
<P>
The Capitol remained open all weekend to visitors as usual.
Outside, the pile of flowers left by passers-by in memory of the
two men grew steadily.
