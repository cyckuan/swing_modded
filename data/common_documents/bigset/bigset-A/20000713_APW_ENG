<HEADLINE> Report: McGrady To Sign With Magic  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- First Orlando, then Miami. Now it appears
to be Orlando again.
</P>
<P>
   Free-agent forward Tracy McGrady said he will sign with the
Magic, just a day after showing interest in the Miami Heat, his
agent said Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Arn Tellum told WPTV-TV in West Palm Beach that he expects
McGrady to sign with the Magic on Aug. 1, the first day of the free
agent-signing period. Tellum said McGrady, from nearby Auburndale,
wanted to be close to home.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no place like home,'' Tellum said.
</P>
<P>
   McGrady spent the last week wavering between Orlando, Chicago
and Miami. The Heat joined the race Tuesday when center Alonzo
Mourning called the 21-year-old former Toronto Raptors star.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic took no chances Wednesday, sending coach Doc Rivers to
meet with McGrady and get a firm commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have him -- today, anyway,'' Rivers told The Orlando
Sentinel. ''I guess we don't really know until Aug. 1, but I feel
good.''
</P>
<P>
   As a free agent, McGrady can't sign a contract until next month.
But he says he's all ready made his choice -- again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've made my decision. I've told the team I'm going to,'' said
McGrady, who averaged 15.4 points and 6.3 rebounds last season with
the Raptors. ''Hey, Alonzo called again. I don't know what he
wanted. I didn't return the call.''
</P>
<P>
   McGrady said a formal announcement could be made by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat tried Wednesday to pull off a seven-player,
sign-and-trade deal that included P.J. Brown and Jamal Mashburn in
exchange for McGrady and Antonio Davis.
</P>
<P>
   But McGrady, who admitted being intrigued by the Heat after his
conversations with Mourning, decided on Orlando after meeting with
Rivers.
</P>
<P>
   McGrady likely will sign a six-year contract for the NBA maximum
of $67.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Free agents Grant Hill and Tim Duncan also announced plans for
next season. Hill committed to Orlando, and Duncan will remain in
San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat are expected to try to sign Charlotte Hornets swingman
Eddie Jones. After spending Tuesday in Miami, he was in Orlando on
Wednesday.

More Than 40 Die In Bombay Mudslide
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BOMBAY, India (AP) -- At least 42 people died and 38 were injured when a
portion of a hill collapsed on unauthorized slums Thursday after more than 24
hours of heavy rain, city officials said. The tin and mud huts built into a
hillside that overlooks a road in eastern Bombay were smashed when the mud
loosened due to the heavy downpour since early Wednesday. Of 80 people taken to
hospital, 42 were declared dead due to injuries or suffocation.

Fiji Military: 4 Resorts Seized
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Two more tourists resorts were seized by protesters in
Fiji Thursday, bringing the number held to four, the military said. The U.S.
government urged all Americans to leave the country amid increasing unrest. The
seizures of the Buca Bay and Rukuruku resorts, which appeared peaceful, came
hours after the takeover of the upscale Laucala Island resort and a day after
the occupation of the Turtle Island Resort where ''The Blue Lagoon'' was filmed.
It was unclear if the takeovers were part of rebel leader George Speight's
efforts to pressure the Great Council of Chiefs, Fiji's traditional power, to
endorse his proposed Cabinet for an interim government.

House Rejects More Debt Relief
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ignoring a threatened veto, the House Wednesday rejected
most of the money President Clinton wanted for debt relief for poor nations. It
threw out an amendment to the foreign aid bill that would have added $390
million over the next two years for an international debt program, leaving the
figure at $69 million. ''I wish we had more but we don't have more,'' said
Republican Rep. Sonny Callahan of Alabama, arguing that under budget caps set
earlier this year the House is not permitted to increase proposed spending
unless an equivalent amount is cut from some other program.

Struggle for Progress at Camp David
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- President Clinton redoubled his efforts to push Israel
and the Palestinians toward a settlement of their half-century conflict at a
summit that was turning out to be difficult. Still, the White House said
Wednesday that there had been ''real engagement'' on substantive issues. Clinton
made plans to remain overnight after what he hoped would be a productive dinner
with Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton was wrestling with all the central issues.
Barak and Arafat met separately with Clinton at Camp David.

Episcopal Bishops Reject Same-Sex Rites
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Episcopal bishops voted against ceremonial rites for same-sex
unions Wednesday, a day after the provision was narrowly rejected by clergy and
lay delegates at the church's national convention. The votes don't mean the
debate is over, though. On Thursday, the bishops planned to discuss a proposal
calling for further study of the theological basis for consecrating same-sex
unions, with the findings to be presented at the next General Convention, in
2003.

Legislature Wednesday in the first such action against a New Hampshire public
official since 1790. The 253-95 House vote sets the stage for a Senate trial
that could result in David Brock's removal for a host of alleged ethics
offenses, some of them more than a decade old. The vote came after seven hours

Brooklyn, bringing down much of an adjacent three-story building. The roof of
the first building fell without breaking, making it more difficult for rescue

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mark Messier, who captained the New York Rangers to the 1994
Stanley Cup, only to leave as a free agent three years later, will rejoin the
team for next season. The Rangers scheduled a news conference Thursday morning
to announce the deal that will reportedly pay the 39-year-old center between $10
million to $11 million for two years. In his third season in New York, Messier
led the Rangers to their first championship in 54 years. He also won five titles
with the Oilers.

<HEADLINE> Water Damages Washington Subway  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeping water is damaging tracks, wiring and
supports in parts of Washington's subway system, monopolizing the
agency's time and resources to patch the problems.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is most intense on the Metro's Red Line, from
Farragut North station in the District of Columbia to the Medical
Center station in suburban Maryland, a total of about nine miles of
track. Washington's subway is one of the deepest in the world, and
the entire system is at or below the water table.
</P>
<P>
   The water is believed to have caused several shutdowns, with
corroded insulators producing smoke, as well as a fire in another
tunnel last month when a metal vent shaft fell onto the track, The
Washington Post reported in Thursday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's crippling our power and communications systems and our
track infrastructure at a rate that is way beyond anything we
thought before,'' Metro General Manager Richard A. White told the
Post. ''The tunnels look like the Luray Caverns,'' a cave formation
in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The water hasn't weakened the structural integrity yet, Metro
officials said, but pools are forming from the constantly falling
water and stalactites are forming from the tunnel ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   The troubled section is the only set of tunnels without a
waterproof liner. Newer tunnels have a vinyl lining that catches
water and diverts it from the concrete walls. At the time the Red
Line tunnel was built engineers thought dense concrete could resist
the water, but micro-fractures have developed over time.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Metro workers plugged about 500 water holes a
year. Now, that figure has rocketed to a projected 4,500 this year.
Every month, Metro pumps about 1.25 billion gallons of water from
the subway tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   ''All we do is spot a hole, patch it, spot another hole and
patch it,'' White told the Post.

<HEADLINE> Jets Pennington To Sign Thursday  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY WILNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Chad Pennington, the first quarterback
chosen in the NFL draft, has agreed to a five-year contract with
the New York Jets, a source close to the negotiations said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Pennington, the 18th overall selection and the third of New
York's unprecedented four first-round picks, will get a $4.1
million signing bonus and a contract loaded with incentives. If he
meets all of those incentives, he could earn as much as $23
million.
</P>
<P>
   He will sign the contract Thursday, when Jets rookies are
required to report to training camp. Pennington will be in camp,
said the source, who asked not to be identified. The veterans
report Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The base contract is worth nearly $6.5 million. But in addition
to the signing bonus, other bonuses within the contract are
predicated on playing time, and Pennington's success could earn him
another $16 million over the life of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   With Pennington's signing, the Jets will have no holdouts.
Earlier this week, they signed defensive end Shaun Ellis and
linebacker John Abraham, the 12th and 13th overall selections.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis, of Tennessee, received a $2.175 million signing bonus and
a deal worth $8.175 million over five years. The third and fourth
seasons are guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham, from South Carolina, also got a five-year deal with the
third and fourth seasons guaranteed. He received a $2 million
signing bonus and a total package worth $7.55 million
</P>
<P>
   During the spring, the Jets signed their other first-rounder,
tight end Anthony Becht of West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Pennington, from Marshall, is expected to be the third-string
quarterback behind Vinny Testaverde and Ray Lucas. But he is
considered the Jets' quarterback of the future.

<HEADLINE> NJ Offender Notification To Resume  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A federal appeals judge Wednesday cleared
the way for state authorities to resume warning residents about sex
offenders who live nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Maryanne Trump Barry of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Philadelphia set aside an April court order freezing
Megan's Law notifications until a dispute over how these
notifications were being conducted could be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The order was imposed after the state Public Defender's office
filed a lawsuit alleging that sex-offender information was being
illegally leaked by residents, and that confidentiality rules were
haphazardly enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Barry and two other federal appeals judges will ultimately
decide the issue. While Wednesday's decision gives no official
indication how the panel will rule, it suggests that a majority
believes guidelines presented by state Attorney General John Farmer
will prevent leaks.
</P>
<P>
   ''My office will notify the 21 county prosecutors today that
they can restart the notification process,'' Farmer said late
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Megan's Law is named for Megan Kanka, a 7-year-old Mercer County
girl who was raped and murdered in 1994 by a convicted sex offender
who lived across the street.
</P>
<P>
   The law requires sex offenders to register with authorities when
they leave prison in New Jersey or move into a neighborhood.
Officials then can alert neighbors, who are under court order not
to circulate the information.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Military: 4 Resorts Seized  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL ALEXANDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Protesters in Fiji seized two more tourists
resorts Thursday, bringing the number held to four, the military
said. The U.S. government urged all Americans to leave the country
amid increasing unrest spawned by a two-month-old parliamentary
hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The seizures of the Buca Bay and Rukuruku resorts, which
appeared peaceful, came hours after the takeover of the upscale
Laucala Island resort and a day after the occupation of the Turtle
Island Resort where ''The Blue Lagoon'' was filmed.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear if the takeovers were part of rebel leader George
Speight's efforts to pressure the Great Council of Chiefs, Fiji's
traditional power, to endorse his proposed Cabinet for an interim
government or if his campaign was spiraling out of control.
</P>
<P>
   The chiefs began meeting Thursday morning to choose a new
president and vice president in line with an agreement signed
Sunday between Speight and the military leader who assumed power
after a May 19 coup. The deal is aimed at freeing the 18 remaining
hostages in Parliament. Nine were released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Laucala Island, formerly owned by late American media magnate
Malcolm Forbes, was sold last year by his estate. It has been
closed for several months, and no tourists were staying at the
pricey resort. Both Buca Bay and Rukuruku aim at the lower end of
the market. It was unclear how many tourists were at each one.
Forty tourists at Turtle Island Resort were released hours after
that takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Incidents of unrest have increased in recent days but most have
been peaceful, although five police officers were injured in a
police station takeover Wednesday at Labasa, which has turned into
a hotbed of Speight support.
</P>
<P>
   But there were growing concerns that the takeovers could spread,
possibly to Fiji's international airport near Nadi. The road from
Nadi to Suva has been blockaded, so disruption of the Nadi airport
also would essentially isolate the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The upgraded U.S. travel advisory urging Americans to leave the
country cited the ongoing unrest ''and the inability of local
authorities to respond to these problems.'' Last week, Washington
recalled the U.S. ambassador for consultations.
</P>
<P>
   Speight was meeting with the chiefs, the final hurdle in his aim
of overturning the Pacific country's elected government and
installing his own after already forcing a backdown by the military
regime.
</P>
<P>
   Speight's group appeared to be backing away from a promise to
release 18 remaining hostages -- including deposed Prime Minister
Mahendra Chaudhry -- on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Speight's spokesman Jo Nata said the military regime had not
finalized decrees enshrining the rebels' demands, including a broad
amnesty for political crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will torpedo the whole process,'' Nata warned on
Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
</P>
<P>
   But Politini said the amnesty is conditional on the release of
the hostages, not the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything that is happening in the country at the moment is
putting pressure on the chiefs,'' Nata said Wednesday. ''Suva is
almost under siege, the whole nation is in chaos. Isn't that what
you'd call holding a gun against the heads of the chiefs?''
</P>
<P>
   Speight has said the protesters are acting independently, but in
support of what he says is his cause -- indigenous Fijian rights.
But some of the disturbances clearly had little to do with
Speight's aims.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen guards were taken hostage on Tuesday by about 50
inmates in the maximum-security ward of Naboro prison, near the
capital, Suva. Police and soldiers deployed around the facility.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's agreement, the military agreed to scrap the
country's multiracial constitution, depose Chaudhry -- Fiji's first
prime minister of ethnic Indian descent -- and grant Speight and his
henchmen amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   The military seized control May 29 following violence and
looting in the wake of the Parliament raid.
</P>
<P>
   Speight's rebels are ethnic Fijians who say the Indian minority
has too much power.
</P>
<P>
   Indo-Fijians, whose ancestors were brought to the islands by
British colonialists over a century ago to work in the rich sugar
cane fields, make up 44 percent of Fiji's 812,000 people. Many
indigenous Fijians, who make up 51 percent of the population,
resent the Indo-Fijians' economic and political clout.

<HEADLINE> Commerce Reviving in Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) -- More than a year ago, Ali Mazreku
was hiding in the woods from the Serbs. Now, he and his brother
sell peaches from Macedonia, bananas from Ecuador and sweets from
Croatia in a clean, well-stocked grocery they built with their own
hands.
</P>
<P>
   The economy isn't exactly booming in this farming town of 60,000
people about 25 miles southwest of Pristina. Ali's older brother
and business partner, Avni, said they often sell food on credit to
their less well-off neighbors in the interest of good community
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the contrast between Malisevo now and the end of
18-month conflict with the Serbs is striking. After the Yugoslav
army overran the town in the summer of 1998, most of the
inhabitants fled to Albania.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the only signs of life in the devastated town center
were a few Serb policemen, stray dogs and a mentally disturbed man
who used to direct traffic in the main intersection, beating
offenders' cars with a stick.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the streets of Malisevo are jammed with cars, townspeople
and the occasional Russian peacekeeper. Stalls selling shoes,
foodstuffs, trinkets and garments have sprung up on sidewalks.
Workmen are reconstructing homes and building new cafes and stores.
</P>
<P>
   It is a pattern that can be seen throughout Kosovo, except in
the economically destitute parts where Serbs remain. Slowly,
tenuously, small-scale commerce is reviving after the destruction
and dislocation of the ethnic conflict and last year's NATO bombing
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Municipal official Jakup Zulfaj said 140 new businesses have
registered in Malisevo since April and he expects the total number
to reach 1,000 by late August. Construction and groceries are the
main businesses, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The private sector is developing at a fast pace, with 70
percent of businesses and private enterprises operating once
again,'' the European Union said in a recent report. ''Although
unemployment is still a serious problem, businesses and enterprises
are employing more than in 1998 and are more productive than
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   International officials credit much of the commercial revival to
the entrepreneurial spirit of Kosovo Albanians, which is rare in
the Balkans, where state domination of the economy was the rule
under communism.
</P>
<P>
   After the Belgrade government began cracking down on restive
Kosovo Albanians in the 1980s, many of them lost state jobs and had
to turn to private trading -- or smuggling -- to survive. Seed money
for businesses often came from family members working in
Switzerland, Germany and other Western countries.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional trade links with neighboring countries have resumed,
although not all of it legal since the NATO-led peacekeeping
command has been unable to stop smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   What is still lacking, however, are major industries which can
jump-start the economy. Outsiders have refrained from any
significant investment until the sticky question of sovereignty is
settled, waiting until Kosovo's political status is decided.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage major foreign investment, Kosovo also needs massive
infrastructure improvements. The poor state of roads, sewers and
utilities would discourage even the bravest investor.
</P>
<P>
   As the poorest and most backward area of the Balkans, Kosovo's
economy traditionally relied on mining, agriculture and power
plants, which sent electricity to the rest of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Most mines are not operating now because ownership is in dispute
between the United Nations, the Yugoslav government and the ethnic
Albanians. Farming has declined because farmers cannot get loans
for seed and are often at risk because of unexploded ordnance left
over from the conflict. Kosovo's antiquated power stations cannot
supply the province's own needs.
</P>
<P>
   All this means that many Kosovo Albanians lack the cash to
revive the economy through consumer spending. Besim Mazreku, who is
no relation to the grocer, sees the effects of the cash crunch
every day.
</P>
<P>
   The former Kosovo Liberation Army fighter supports 24 members of
his extended family by selling sports shoes from an outdoor stall,
and worries that the business boom won't last.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not in good shape,'' Mazreku said. ''I've taken a loan
but now I have to repay. Demand for shoes is very low. June and
July, these two months have been horrible. Maybe people don't have
money.''

<HEADLINE> Errol Flynn's Widow Remembers  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW J. ROSENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ANTONIO, Jamaica (AP) -- As she sips rum and coke on a lazy
afternoon, the years melt away. In the soft Jamaican twilight you
can almost see the winsome young actress, fresh out of Kansas,
sailing the high seas and sharing an adventure with her roguish,
charming man.
</P>
<P>
   Four decades after the death of Errol Flynn, his memory and
legend are still strong in the Caribbean seaside town he adopted,
where his widow Patrice Wymore still lives, a respected town elder
and sometime cattle magnate.
</P>
<P>
   Married and widowed young, the sprightly 73-year-old retains a
youthful discomfort with the swashbuckling image Flynn cultivated --
and, according to tales still told with relish in these parts,
justly earned.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've stopped listening years ago,'' she says, dragging on a
cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   Sunglasses shielding her eyes, a wistful crack in her voice, she
describes their many forays to Jamaica as ''our retreat -- the place
to get away from the spotlights.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We were very busy doing nothing. We spent most days rafting,''
she says. ''That's not to say there wouldn't be a party on the drop
of hat.''
</P>
<P>
   Flynn discovered Jamaica when his crippled schooner limped into
Kingston during a 1946 storm. He at first didn't know where he was,
but he grew to love the country, describing it as a paradise in his
autobiography ''My Wicked, Wicked Ways,'' published posthumously in
1976.
</P>
<P>
   ''Never had I seen a land so beautiful,'' he wrote. ''Everywhere
there is a blanket of green so thick that the earth never shows
through.''
</P>
<P>
   He found Port Antonio while motorcycling around the country.
Like other visitors over the years -- from J.P. Morgan and William
Randolph Hearst to Harrison Ford and Tom Cruise, whose 1988 movie
''Cocktail'' was filmed nearby -- he was struck by the wood houses
and stone mansions framed by tropical forest, seaside cliffs and
beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn began bringing Wymore here after they met in 1950 on the
set of ''Rocky Mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I liked (Port Antonio's) simplicity,'' she says. ''It had that
kind of barefoot elegance, the people were kind and sweet. They
still are.''
</P>
<P>
   Fanciful -- if dubious -- accounts of Flynn's carousing are still
legend here.
</P>
<P>
   Vinroy Donaldson, 92, recalled seeing Flynn ''come into this
little rum shop where I was playing dominoes ... with three, four,
five women,'' and begin drinking the notoriously strong white rum
''straight down like a Jamaican!''
</P>
<P>
   An old taxi driver said he once saw Flynn drive a Cadillac into
a pool without ruining his cigar.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cut an imperial figure along the north shore of Jamaica,''
Flynn reported in his book, recalling various hijinks -- letting a
crocodile loose in Montego Bay -- and paying detailed homage to
''the beauty of the Jamaican females.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I presumed that she knew what my life was,'' he wrote of
Wymore. ''She knew the kind of man she was marrying ... a leopard
can't change his spots.'' Still, Wymore ''could cook Indian curry,
she could dance, she could sing, she was reserved, she had beauty,
dignity. ... If marriages are sensible, which I question -- I
thought I would give it a try.''
</P>
<P>
   Wymore confirms one popular story -- that Flynn won tiny nearby
Navy Island playing ''either poker or craps or dominoes.'' But the
deed was lost and the island is now a government resort.
</P>
<P>
   They also bought the once-glamorous Titchfield Hotel -- which
burned down in 1969 -- and dreamed of turning the area into a
tourist mecca. But financing and other problems intervened, and
Flynn died of a heart attack in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   One treasure remained -- the 2,000-acre ''Errol Flynn Estates''
cattle farm east of town, which Flynn bought in the 1950s and where
he once hosted British playwright Noel Coward.
</P>
<P>
   Wymore returned to the ranch permanently in 1967, after a
briefly revived career in which she appeared in a few movies,
including ''Ocean's Eleven'' with Frank Sinatra. She devoted
herself to the cows, including a herd of Jamaica Reds, and once
even won the Champion Farmer of Jamaica title.
</P>
<P>
   She was looking for a ''more enduringly satisfactory way of
life'' for her and Arnella, her daughter with Flynn who became a
model and died two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always wanted to own a cattle farm when I was finished with
my career,'' Wymore says. ''I just had no idea it would be in
Jamaica.''

<HEADLINE> Whitman Won't Apologize for Photo  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- People who spend time on the streets here
say pat-downs by police are a way of life. Even a frisking by the
governor is not unimaginable, some say.
</P>
<P>
   But most are outraged by a 1996 photo that shows Gov. Christie
Whitman searching a black male in Camden. They are particularly
angered by the fact that Whitman appears to be smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's insulting. Her being the governor, coming into a city as
poor as Camden and doing this,'' said Ira Sapp, who showed the
picture to friends in a corner grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody felt the same way. It's not right. It's not fair,
and why is she smiling?'' he said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The photograph shows Whitman standing behind the man, who has
his arms spread and palms pressed up against a wall. The governor
is wearing jeans, a sweatshirt, a baseball cap and black gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Dupree said he is familiar with the man's position in the
picture.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yeah, I've been patted down by the cops. It's not a good
feeling and it's not something to laugh about,'' said Dupree, who
works in a barber shop.
</P>
<P>
   Ice vendor Ray English said he was disgusted by the governor's
actions.
</P>
<P>
   ''She thinks it's funny. This woman has no sense,'' English
said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman has defended the search, and says two tours with the
State Police in 1996 helped push her to address Camden's dire
social ills. In the months before her visit, the state's poorest
city logged a record number of homicides.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said the crime rate has dropped dramatically, a new
county prosecutor is in place, federal authorities have targeted
municipal corruption and the state is attempting to take over city
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Since the picture became widely public, Whitman has repeatedly
rejected critics who say it is an example of racial profiling,
where minorities are targeted for searches by authorities. Troopers
offered her a suspect to search and she did, Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, whose protest over racial profiling shut
down the Atlantic City Expressway last year, said he will meet
Thursday with members of the Black Ministers Council of New Jersey
to plan demonstrations.

<HEADLINE> American Indian Youth Crime Rises  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- They come into Elaine Newton's court by the
dozens, charged with underage drinking, using marijuana, fighting.
Some are as young as 11.
</P>
<P>
   They are children without a childhood, being sucked into the
vortex of drinking and despair that destroys too many people on
Colorado's remote Southern Ute Indian reservation. Newton, the
tribe's chief judge, sees more of them every year.
</P>
<P>
   Many, Newton said, are victims themselves, either of abuse or
what she calls ''emotional incest.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That's where children basically are left to feel responsible
for their parents' own emotional needs,'' Newton said. ''They feel
it's their fault that mom is drinking or dad leaves, when it's
really not their fault.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we forget they are children.''
</P>
<P>
   As crime rates fall nationwide, they are rising in American
Indian communities, especially among the 43 percent of Indians
under age 20. Indian youth are far more likely to be arrested for
alcohol-related crimes than their non-Indian counterparts,
according to a report released Thursday by a government advisory
panel.
</P>
<P>
   The Coalition for Juvenile Justice report said 3 percent of
juveniles arrested for liquor law violations are Indian, though
Indians make up just 1 percent of all juveniles. The coalition, a
nonprofit group of state advisory boards created under a federal
juvenile justice law, recommends expanding programs to fight Indian
alcoholism, depression and gangs.
</P>
<P>
   ''In states with significant American Indian communities,
American Indian youth are found far too frequently in the back of
squad cars, rather than in the front of classrooms,'' the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile crime is one strand in the web of social problems
facing urban and reservation Indian communities, the report said.
High reservation unemployment is one factor.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are limited opportunities on the reservation, especially
those in rural areas,'' said Kevin Shendoe, a member of New
Mexico's Jemez Pueblo who started a group to help youths develop
leadership skills. ''Given that and the history of alcoholism and
poverty, I think it all plays into students getting depressed and
frustrated -- and in certain serious cases, violent.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is abuse passed down from generation to
generation, often starting with Indian children forced into
government or religious boarding schools where tribal culture was
suppressed and abuse and neglect were commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cultural oppression has taken a heavy toll on Native Americans
for years,'' Newton said. ''There's been a lack of parenting
because of boarding schools. Parents don't know how to be parents.
... In society today, you're in between two cultures. They lost
their Indian culture and they're struggling with trying to figure
out where they fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Indians have some of the worst health care and highest death
rates from alcoholism, diabetes, accidents and suicide in the
nation. That means many young Indians are repeatedly traumatized by
deaths of friends and relatives, said Sandi Ernst, a psychologist
who ran the White Mountain Apache Tribe's child mental health
programs from 1993 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   A large number of children affected by alcohol in their mothers'
wombs also contributes to the crime problem, said Ernst, who now
practices in Phoenix. People exposed to alcohol in the womb are
more impulsive and often cannot understand consequences of their
behavior, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That increases the likelihood they're going to do stupid
things,'' Ernst said.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal programs, which must rely on federal funding, are too
often shortchanged, the report said. Newton said getting enough
money to help the children she sentences is a constant problem.
Children who have enough Indian heritage to qualify for some
federal programs but are not enrolled members of the tribe often
fall through the cracks, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It often seems like there's no funding available to help us,''
Newton said. ''If we need treatment for sexual abuse or domestic
violence or alcohol treatment, there's no one to help us. It's kind
of like these problems never get resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Newton also thinks that Indian communities must take
responsibility for ending the cycle of abuse and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of us are in denial about what has happened,'' Newton
said. ''We cover up things or say nothing's wrong in our families.
We don't make our families accountable for the wrongs we may have
done.
</P>
<P>
   ''My sense is we need to validate what has happened, grieve and
then move on. Until you can do that, you just don't resolve
anything.''

<HEADLINE> Gypies Not Getting Holocaust Funds  </HEADLINE>
By ALISON MUTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORNETU, Romania (AP) -- He was deported by Nazi-backed
authorities and forced into backbreaking slave labor. Almost 60
years after his ordeal, Constantin Constantin is still waiting for
at least token compensation.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of 25,000 Gypsies deported under orders of Marshal
Ion Antonescu, who was supported by Nazi Germany. They were sent in
1942 to a region that is in today's Ukraine to work in camps as
slave laborers. Many died of typhoid, starvation and maltreatment.
Only 6,000 returned to Romania.
</P>
<P>
   Constantin, who needs surgery on his sinuses says he's ''a dead
man,'' from all the waiting for compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Humanitarian assistance for needy victims of the Holocaust has
been available since 1997, including a Swiss fund and a German one.
But both have mostly disbursed money to Jewish survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss fund provides $771 for victims. The Swiss created the
fund because of dormant bank accounts held by Jewish and other
survivors of the Holocaust. The German fund earmarks $500 for
eastern European Nazi victims whose illnesses can be traced back to
the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Jews had a more efficient system,'' said Barbara
Ekwall-Uebelhart, Secretary General for the Swiss Fund for Needy
Victims of the Holocaust. ''For the Gypsies it was more difficult
to find an organization to help them. Many of them do not have any
documents.''
</P>
<P>
   Constantin, 67, definitely could use the money. He lives in a
three-room dwelling with mud walls, in the middle of a corn field
just southeast of Bucharest. He and his extended family of 10 have
no electricity, running water or regular employment.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Floarea Panciu, also a deportee eligible for
compensation, is suffering from tuberculosis. When a reporter
arrives, the cry goes up from Constantin, ''Have you brought the
money?''
</P>
<P>
   For two years, Michelle Kelso, an American author and researcher
of Gypsy Holocaust in Romania, has been fighting to help Gypsies
access the Swiss fund for Holocaust victims. Gypsies, or Roma as
they call themselves, are believed to number up to 1 million in
Romania. Many are illiterate and not used to dealing with
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Constantin is one of more than 200 people that German and Swiss
authorities have deemed eligible for Holocaust funds, thanks to
Kelso's work.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss authorities said they would originally send the money to
the Romanian state savings bank, but the procedure proved too
complicated. Then they said they would send the money to an Israeli
bank, the Bank for Industrial and Commercial Loans, but that idea
proved too expensive as the institution wanted $50 to cover
administration charges.
</P>
<P>
   They have now agreed to put the money into the post office,
demanding a waiver that victims would have no further claims on
Swiss banks. ''It is tragic how long this process has taken,'' said
Kelso.
</P>
<P>
   German authorities are still trying to gather records pertaining
to the deportations from the archives. That process was completed
two weeks ago and now the verification by the International Red
Cross is underway.
</P>
<P>
   Of the roughly 1 million Gypsies living in Europe at the time of
World War II, historians estimate the Nazis and their allies killed
about 500,000 of the darker-skinned Roma, including 21,000 at
Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   ''These people are old and sick. Some of them have died,'' said
Kelso, who is from Austin, Texas. ''They don't have any political
voice.''

<HEADLINE> Three Slain in Tennesee Town  </HEADLINE>
By VICKI BROWN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMYRNA, Tenn. (AP) -- The grieving family of William Troy Snell
sat on their front porch recalling his short life of 18 years and
searching for answers.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it was a robbery and they gave them the money, why not just
leave everyone alone? Why would someone do this?'' asked his
mother, Billie Snell, her face stained with tears.
</P>
<P>
   Her son was one of three fast-food workers found shot to death
Wednesday after an apparent robbery at a Captain D's restaurant 20
miles southeast of Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Snell's body was found in the driver's seat of a car outside a
discount store behind Captain D's. Indications that the teen worked
at the seafood restaurant led police inside.
</P>
<P>
   They discovered two other bodies in a back room cooler: Scott
Myers, 42, of Memphis, and another worker, who police did not
identify pending notification of relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Police suspect robbery as the motive, but Sgt. Scott Byers would
not give details.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Snell said her son started working at the restaurant three
months ago to buy a new Mazda Protege -- the car in which his body
was found -- and to pay its insurance.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Kimothy Snell, said his son also was paying for
summer school, retaking an English class he failed at La Vergne
High School ''because he knew he'd messed up and he was determined
to graduate next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers' wife declined to comment when reached at her Memphis
home.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Marshall, a spokeswoman for Shoney's Inc., the parent
company of Captain D's, called the shootings ''a terrible
tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're all in a state of shock,'' she said. ''Our hearts go out
to the families and to our co-workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said the company is providing counseling for the
victims' families, assistance with funeral arrangements and help
with travel plans for out-of-town relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths renewed fears in Tennessee, where seven restaurant
workers were murdered over three months in 1997. Paul Dennis Reid
was convicted of the slayings, which included two workers at a
Captain D's in suburban Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was scared to death after the Paul Reid incidents,'' said
Angie Ryman, 21, who works at a local McDonald's with her fiance.
''Today, we're going to look for other jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   But others said violence can happen anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''That could happen at anybody's house, at anybody's job,'' said
Abe Hasan, owner of the BP Oil station next door to the Captain
D's.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Steps Back From Peace Talks  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- After two days of shuttling back and forth
between the Israelis and the Palestinians, President Clinton was
stepping back from Mideast summiteering Thursday, temporarily
turning over the reins to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton prepared to honor two previous commitments -- an
address to the NAACP in Baltimore and a medal ceremony in
Washington -- the White House adhered to its steadfast refusal to
discuss the substance of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's chief spokesman, Joe Lockhart, described Wednesday's
meetings at the Camp David presidential retreat as ''a busy day
between all parties, a day of engagement.''
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of any claim of progress, Lockhart warned against
drawing any conclusions as to whether gaps were being narrowed in
the talks. ''Nothing should be read one way or the other,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Without elaborating, Lockhart said the two sides had been
concentrating on ''core issues.'' Those disputes -- the most
contentious ones separating the two sides -- include the status of
Jerusalem, claimed by both sides as their capital; the borders of
any future Palestinian state; and the status of more than 2 million
Palestinian refugees and their descendants.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a series of informal encounters among members of
the three delegations, Wednesday's sessions included separate
discussions by Clinton with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in
the morning and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in the late
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat and Clinton talked as they strolled along a wooded
pathway, according to Lockhart, who has repeatedly said that the
rustic, informal atmosphere at the Catoctin Mountains presidential
retreat was proving conducive to talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a substantive encounter,'' White House spokesman P.J.
Crowley said of the Clinton-Arafat meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The president then met with Palestinian negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   All the delegations had dinner together, repeating what has
become a custom of communal meals taken at three long wooden tables
in a Camp David cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart stressed he did not expect any loss of momentum due to
Clinton's absence for part of Thursday, pointing out that Albright
already had held talks with both leaders and presided at meetings
of delegates from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Enforced togetherness, though, has been credited in the past
with contributing to success. At the watershed Camp David summit of
1978, which paved the way for peace between Israel and Egypt,
President Jimmy Carter spent 13 days and nights at the retreat,
demanding that other participants do the same.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, meanwhile, may seek to break the isolation
from the outside world that has prevailed so far. Palestinian
sources said Arafat wanted to hold a ''leadership meeting'' with
Palestinian officials who were not part of his delegation and thus
have not been allowed inside Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether such a gathering could take place at
Camp David. Lockhart said he knew of no planned arrivals having
been cleared by security. The State Department said prior to the
talks, though, that it would be permissible to bring in outside
experts as needed.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat traveled to the United States with a large entourage,
including some political opponents, in what was seen as an effort
to broaden his base of support for any deal that is struck.
</P>
<P>
   Despite pledges of secrecy all around, some purported details of
the negotiations emerged.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, Cabinet minister Haim Ramon, a Barak confidant, said
a proposed land swap -- unpopulated land within Israel proper, in
exchange for West Bank land on which large Jewish settlement blocs
have been built -- was on the table at Camp David. It was the first
time an Israeli official had publicly acknowledged willingness in
principle to consider such a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart refused comment on Ramon's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   On the sidelines of the talks, some Israeli and Palestinian
officials who were not part of the delegations -- and thus free to
talk -- expressed optimism about the way the talks were going.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will have an agreement, and I hope it will also bring peace
and security to the Palestinians,'' said Rabbi Michael Melchior,
the Diaspora affairs minister.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, who until now have been more pessimistic about
prospects, brightened their tone somewhat, saying Arafat came to
Camp David with the intention of securing an accord.

<HEADLINE> Congress Moves to Withhold Peru Aid  </HEADLINE>
By KEN GUGGENHEIM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The widely criticized re-election of Peruvian
President Alberto Fujimori could cost his country $10 million in
U.S. aid under a proposal receiving bipartisan support in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, sponsored by Sen. Paul Coverdell, R.-Ga., could
affect 10 percent of the $100 million Peru receives from the United
States and require the United States to oppose aid to Peru in most
votes of international financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell said the effort shows Congress plans to keep pressure
on Peru, ''that we don't just get bogged down, turn away and pay
little attention in our own hemisphere when we have instances that
really rattle the premise of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori was elected to a third term May 28 in an election in
which his only rival withdrew, alleging potential fraud and
unfairness in the electoral system. The Organization of American
States pulled out its election monitors after Peru refused to delay
the vote to ensure a fairer vote.
</P>
<P>
   After sending a high-level mission to Peru last month, the OAS
said Fujimori agreed to work with the organization and government
opponents to improve the judiciary, guarantee press freedoms and
fix flaws in the electoral system.
</P>
<P>
   However, political analysts and his opponents question
Fujimori's willingness to make reforms. Fujimori has ignored
international criticism in the past, including when he temporarily
closed the Congress and the Supreme Court in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's proposal would give President Clinton 90 days to
certify whether Peru has made significant progress toward restoring
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions would be applied if Peru hasn't made progress, though
most aid -- such as humanitarian and drug-fighting assistance --
would not be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell said the sanctions would be more than symbolic.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's put it this way: If I had 10 percent of your paycheck,
I'd have your attention,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was an amendment to a foreign spending bill
approved by the Senate last month. The opposing ideologies of its
co-sponsors -- liberal Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and conservative Jesse
Helms, R-N.C. -- reflect its bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., will try to have the
language added to the House's foreign spending bill being
considered this week. Even if that fails, it could still be in the
final measure worked out by House-Senate conferees.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has not commented on the proposal. It has
generally followed the OAS' lead with Peru, though U.S. officials
have warned that Peru could face sanctions if it doesn't make
democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The Peruvian Embassy in Washington issued a statement
criticizing the proposal as contrary to an OAS assembly resolution
in Windsor, Ont., in June that didn't call for sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any unilateral action would not only be rash, but would also
oppose the spirit of the OAS assembly and could damage the effort
Peru is developing together with the hemispheric community to
fulfill the commitments made in Windsor,'' the embassy said.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time Congress has expressed displeasure
with Peru. In April, before the first round of the presidential
election, Congress approved a resolution warning Peru it could face
political and economic reprisals if there are problems in the
election process.
</P>
<P>
   Also, in approving a $1.3 billion package to help Colombia in
the drug fight, House and Senate conferees deleted language that
would have allocated up to $42 million for Peru in anti-drug aid.
Peru can still receive up to $40 million under general U.S.
anti-drug aid for countries in the Andes.

<HEADLINE> Former Starr Aide Goes on Trial  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Charles Bakaly III, the former independent
counsel spokesman, is going on trial on charges he misled a judge
about news leaks during the Monica Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson ordered the Justice
Department to prosecute the onetime aide to former Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr in a non-jury trial set to begin today.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contend Bakaly misled Johnson, the chief judge of
federal district court in Washington, when he denied leaking
material in January 1999. They contend Bakaly later changed his
account to acknowledge he may have ''unwittingly'' confirmed
information for a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly is charged in the criminal contempt-of-court proceeding
with obstructing justice and making false statements to Johnson.
The Justice Department said that if Bakaly is convicted, it would
recommend a sentence of six months imprisonment or less.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times story at issue was written during impeachment
proceedings against the president, and said that Starr's office
concluded a sitting president could be criminally indicted.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson on Wednesday turned down Bakaly's motion to dismiss the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   The former spokesman argued that any false statements about his
conversations with a Times reporter were not material to the
central issue: whether the information in the story involved secret
grand jury matters.
</P>
<P>
   The former spokesman also contended that even if the information
did involve grand jury matters, it did not obstruct the
investigation of news leaks. Obstruction is a key element that
prosecutors would have to prove in order to convict Bakaly.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court eventually ruled that the Times article
did not reveal grand jury material, but Bakaly's original
statements denying any leaks came before that ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''Put simply, the materiality of a false declaration must be
measured at the point in time at which it was executed and filed
with the court,'' Johnson said, adding that Bakaly's argument
''strains logic past the breaking point.''
</P>
<P>
   She also ruled that Bakaly's alleged false statements about
leaks met the test for obstruction of justice because they caused
''added delay and expense'' to the independent counsel and FBI,
which investigated the leaked material. She said the statements
also resulted in more work for the court.

<HEADLINE> Running Red Lights Kills 800 A Year  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 800 people die and some 200,000
people are injured each year in the United States because of
lead-footed drivers who press the gas pedal to the floor when a
traffic light turns red, an insurance industry study says.
</P>
<P>
   The report to be released Thursday by the Insurance Institute
for Highway Safety found that between 1992 and 1998, almost 6,000
people died in such crashes, and more than half of them were
pedestrians and occupants of other vehicles hit by red light
runners.
</P>
<P>
   Another 2,779 deaths occurred in the vehicles running the red
lights. During the same period, about 1.5 million people were
injured.
</P>
<P>
   ''Red light running is more than just a form of aggressive
driving. People are dying and getting hurt needlessly because of
it,'' said Ed Rust Jr., chairman of the institute and chief
executive of State Farm Insurance, said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the institute studied data from the
Transportation Department and found that fatal crashes at traffic
signals increased 18 percent from 1992 and 1998, more than three
times the rate of increase for all other fatal crashes during that
time.
</P>
<P>
   In each state, the researchers examined the rate of red light
running deaths per 100,000 residents and determined that the states
with the highest death rate were Arizona, with a rate of 7.1
deaths; Nevada with 3.9; Michigan with 3.7; Texas with 3.5; and
Alabama with 3.4.
</P>
<P>
   Among cities, the rate was highest in Phoenix, with 10.8 deaths
per 100,000 people, followed by Memphis, Tenn., with a rate of 8.0;
Mesa, Ariz., with a rate of 7.8 deaths; Tucson, Ariz., and St.
Petersburg, Fla., both with a rate of 7.6 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   In releasing the data, the institute endorsed the use of red
light cameras, which photograph vehicles running red lights and
ticket violators by mail. Such programs, used in about 40 U.S.
communities, reduce red light running by about 40 percent,
according to the institute.
</P>
<P>
   However, privacy advocates, including the American Civil
Liberties Union, have expressed concerns about how the cameras are
used.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't opposed cameras for the specific use enforcing
traffic violations,'' said Barry Steinhardt, associate director of
the American Civil Liberties Union. ''We are concerned about
mission creep, that these cameras will be used for other purposes,
and it's classically true that surveillance techniques created for
one purpose are rarely restricted to that purpose.''

<HEADLINE> Livingston County plans longest plastic span  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - Livingston County officials are laying
out plans to build the nation's longest plastic bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The plastic bridge will be more expensive to build than bridges
of steel and concrete, but the town of Avon's 40-foot plastic
project is likely to last decades longer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not going to rot. It's not going to rust,'' said county
Highway Superintendent Don Higgins. ''Theoretically, there isn't
anything that can go wrong with it except actual impact - if
someone hits it.''
</P>
<P>
   In engineer lingo, the bridge will be of carbon fiber reinforced
polymers, or FRP. ''Basically, it's plastic,'' said Higgins.
</P>
<P>
   The FRP technology is relatively new in roads and bridgework,
according to the Cornell Local Roads Program.
</P>
<P>
   Construction on Avon's $515,000 bridge will start next spring,
with the federal government picking up $220,000.
</P>
<P>
   The federal cash comes largely because the size of this bridge
over the Conesus Lake Outlet will push the envelope of plastic
bridge design.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic bridges are rare in New York but one was successfully
built in Steuben County and another was built in Chemung County,
according to the state Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The current crumbling bridge was built in 1948 and has an 18-ton
weight limit.

<HEADLINE> GOP Blast Clinton For Waterways Plan  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Environmentalists and a handful of Republican
lawmakers are accusing the Clinton administration of waffling on a
commitment to keep waste out of the country's waterways.
</P>
<P>
   The critics say the push for a change in federal environmental
rules is meant to benefit the coal mining industry and appease West
Virginia's powerful Sen. Robert Byrd, who has fought to allow
mining companies to dump sediment into rivers and streams.
</P>
<P>
   They applauded Clinton for standing up to Byrd in the past, but
now accuse his administration of kowtowing to the ranking
Democratic member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a flip-flop,'' said Brent Blackwelder, president of
the environmental group Friends of the Earth. ''It's giving with
one hand and taking with the other.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers want the Environmental Protection Agency and Army
Corps of Engineers to drop plans to write a new definition of
''fill'' -- material shoveled into waterways to create solid ground.
The idea is open to public comment until next Wednesday, after
which the heads of the EPA and Army Corps will issue a rule.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to stand by and let this happen. If we allow
it to happen, we are negating our environmental laws,'' said Rep.
Christopher Shays said at a news conference with fellow Connecticut
Republican Rep. Nancy Johnson; New York Reps. Ben Gilman and Rick
Lazio; and California Rep. Brian Bilbray.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism comes a day after the EPA -- over the objections of
Republicans -- issued rules requiring states to examine more than
20,000 lakes, streams and other waterways, establish which ones are
most polluted and develop a cleanup program to meet federal water
quality standards. The new cleanup requirements eventually could
cost farmers, businesses and other polluters billions of dollars a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Clean Water Act specifically prohibits using waste as fill,
but the new definition will effectively erase that ban, the
lawmakers said. The Army Corps is the agency that grants fill
permits.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's illegal to use waste as fill, and they're trying to get
around that by changing the rules,'' said Joan Mulhern, a lawyer
with Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   W. Michael McCabe, the EPA's acting deputy administrator, said
the lawmakers and environmentalists were distorting the agency's
attempts to strengthen safeguards for waterways.
</P>
<P>
   He said the proposal would make it more difficult for polluters
to dump waste in the water, though he did not say how.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed change stems from a West Virginia U.S. District
Court judge's ruling last year that coal mining companies were
violating the Clean Water Act by dumping waste into waterways.
</P>
<P>
   The decision said coal companies could not dump rock and dirt
within 100 feet of perennial streams, which flow year-round, and
intermittent streams, which flow at least six months a year. It
said ephemeral streams, those that flow as a result of snow melt or
rain, could be buried by the waste, a practice called valley fills.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is being appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd tried to attach a measure to a federal spending plan in
November that would have legislatively overturned the court ruling.
The effort ended when Clinton said he would veto the bill if the
mining amendment was tied to it.
</P>
<P>
   Bilbray called the proposed rule change ''absolutely absurd,''
and slammed Byrd for trying to ''move the Clean Water Act to
ancient history when pollutants were not only allowed, they were
encouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman from Byrd's office did not return phone calls.

<HEADLINE> House Rejects Poor Nation Relief  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democrats failed in several hours of
emotional debate to win the money President Clinton wants to help
40 of the world's poorest nations.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring a threatened veto, the House late Wednesday rejected an
amendment to the foreign aid bill that would have added $390
million over the next two years for an international debt program,
mostly in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The action left the figure for Third World debt relief at $69
million.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said rejection of the extra money
''condemns countless hundreds of thousands of innocent children to
death by starvation and disease.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a responsibility to help those who have been left
behind,'' said Rep. Nita M. Lowey, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will be judged on how we treat the least among us,'' said
Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Gene Sperling, head of
the president's National Economic Council, told reporters earlier
Wednesday that the amount included in the bill would not meet U.S.
obligations under a program launched last year by the world's
richest industrial countries.
</P>
<P>
   The bill as it stands now would provide $82 million for debt,
including $12.6 million for environmental debt relief and $69
million for the general debt relief of $435 million requested by
the administration for debt relief for 40 of the world's poorest
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president's advisers will recommend that the president
veto the bill,'' Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans argued that under budget caps set earlier this
year the House was not permitted to increase the proposed spending
unless an equivalent amount was cut from some other program.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish we had more but we don't have more,'' said Republican
Rep. Sonny Callahan of Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Frank said denying relief to the world's most needy is the
''cruelest single act of public policy I can recall in 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are creating wealth at a pace unparalleled in the history
of the world,'' he said. ''A relatively small amount of money ...
could alleviate untold sufferings.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are being asked to share what we have with some of the most
needy people in the world,'' said Rep. Danny K. Davis, D-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some day ... I'd like to be part of a Congress that ends
hunger, that ends disease,'' said Rep. Tony P. Hall, D-Ohio. ''We
can end tuberculosis, we can end cholera and we can end polio.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., said Americans can ''be
proud'' of their foreign spending.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's always more money that could be spent. There are
always more things that could be done by government,'' Diaz-Balart
said. ''But I am not ashamed of what the American people, through
their Congress, do in foreign aid.''
</P>
<P>
   The reluctance of Congress to fully fund the U.S. share of the
debt relief package comes at an embarrassing time for Clinton, who
is due to attend this year's annual economic summit next week in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   At last year's summit, the world's seven richest countries -- the
United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada --
pledged to write off $50 billion in debt owed by poor nations.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials fear that lack of action on the part of
Congress will give other countries a chance to retreat from their
own promises, threatening the collapse of the whole initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The debt issue has been pushed by a collection of religious
organizations operating under the banner, Jubilee 2000. In a
ceremony outside the Capitol, the group presented the members of
Congress with boxes full of petitions it said had been signed by
500,000 Americans urging debt forgiveness for poor nations.
</P>
<P>

Fiji Leaders Release Hostages
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Coup leaders on Thursday released the remaining 18
hostages in a two-month-old parliamentary hostage crisis, Fijian radio said. The
crisis has spawned increasing unrest in Fiji, including the seizure of at least
four tourist resorts, the military said. Coup leader George Speight and deposed
Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry hugged before Chaudry and other hostages were
loaded onto two trucks, the radio said. The trucks arrived to applause at the
Fiji Red Cross Society building, where the hostages were to undergo quick
medical checks. The release followed a deal Sunday, when the military agreed to
scrap the country's multiracial constitution, depose Chaudhry and grant Speight
and his henchmen amnesty.

   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- After two days of shuttling back and forth between the
Israelis and the Palestinians, President Clinton was stepping back from Mideast
summiteering Thursday, temporarily turning over the reins to Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright. As Clinton prepared to honor two previous commitments -- an
address to the NAACP in Baltimore and a medal ceremony in Washington -- the
White House adhered to its steadfast refusal to discuss the substance of the
talks. In addition to a series of informal encounters among members of the three
delegations, Wednesday's sessions included separate discussions by Clinton with
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in the morning and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat in the late afternoon.

   BOMBAY, India (AP) -- At least 42 people died and 38 were injured when part
of a hill loosened by monsoon rain collapsed on unauthorized slums, city
officials said Thursday. The tin and mud huts built into a hillside that
overlooks a road in eastern Bombay were smashed late Wednesday when the mud
loosened due to the heavy downpour since earlier in the previous 24 hours. Of 80
people taken to the hospital, 42 were declared dead due to injuries or

Philadelphia set aside an April court order freezing Megan's Law notifications

<HEADLINE> More Than 40 Die In Bombay Mudslide  </HEADLINE>
By RAMOLA TALWAR BADAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOMBAY, India (AP) -- At least 42 people died and 38 were injured
when part of a hill loosened by monsoon rain collapsed on
unauthorized slums, city officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people live in tin and mud huts built into a Balbati
Hill, a hillside overlooking eastern Bombay, and workers said there
could be another 25 bodies buried under the debris that fell
Wednesday night. Scores of others were believed to have fled.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rescue work is still going on. The rain is making it very
difficult to move the debris,'' said P. Jadhav, a municipal
official.
</P>
<P>
   The annual monsoon rain has crippled transport services, with
clogged drains causing roads and railroad tracks to flood
throughout India's largest city. It took rescuers four hours to
reach the site because of the congestion and once they got there
small lanes jammed with huts leading up the hill slowed them
further.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said those injured could not be given treatment
immediately because there were so few staff at the hospital closest
to Balbati Hillock.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers helped municipal workers and civil defense staff, who
used bulldozers to move debris through the night. ''We are still
hopeful of finding survivors,'' said Sunil Chavan, a fire officer.
</P>
<P>
   Council member Pravin Chira said officials have warned of
landslide dangers. ''We told people to vacate the slums, but no one
listened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses and hospitals reported thin attendance since most
people headed back home rather than complete journeys of up to four
hours to reach their offices in downtown Bombay.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of newcomers to Bombay are being blamed for driving up
the city's population, pushing it from the world's fifth most
populated city today to likely the second by 2015. Bombay's
population of 15 million is expected to grow to more than 27
million in the next 15 years, placing it just behind Tokyo,
according to United Nations projections released last week.
</P>
<P>
   While municipal workers boast that 60 percent of Bombay's
residents are covered by family planning programs, they say the
rising population is the fault of the migrant slum population and
rural poor who flock to the city.

<HEADLINE> Solomon Islands Plans Defense Force  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONIARA, Solomon Islands -- The Solomon Islands plans to create
its first defense force as part of a plan to defuse almost two
years of deadly ethnic fighting in the Pacific island nation, the
new prime minister said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The force is part of the new government's ''Peace Plan 2000,''
said Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare. That is his government's
first policy document aimed at ending an ethnic dispute over land
which has wracked the country.
</P>
<P>
   The defense force would oversee national security, do civil
works and assist in times of natural disaster. It wasn't
immediately clear when the force would be created.
</P>
<P>
   The peace plan includes setting a framework for peace talks
between two warring armed militias, amnesties for their members and
compensation payments to victims of the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Sogavare said he expected that militiamen from both sides would
join the new defense force, which would help rehabilitate the
fighters and ''bring these young people who are now used to holding
guns back to normal life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Solomon Islands is an archipelago nation of some 455,000
people spread over 10 large volcanic islands and four groups of
smaller ones 1,600 miles northeast of Sydney, Australia. It does
not have its own army, and the police force is the government's
armed domestic authority.
</P>
<P>
   The main island of Guadalcanal was the scene of a bloody and
drawn-out World War II battle, when U.S. Marines began their
island-hopping Pacific assault on Japanese forces after the attack
on Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic dispute escalated on June 5, when rebels from the
island of Malaita raided a police armory in the capital, Honiara,
seized the city and forced Prime Minister Bartholomew Ulufa'alu to
resign.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels were angry that over the past 19 months indigenous
people of Guadalcanal, known as Isatabus, have expelled 20,000
people who migrated there from nearby Malaita in recent decades to
find jobs and land. As many as 60 people have been killed in the
past few months.
</P>
<P>
   Since the June 5 uprising, a tense standoff has existed between
Malaitan and Isatabu factions.
</P>
<P>
   Sogavare -- elected by lawmakers after Ulufa'alu's ouster -- is
trying to bring the fighting groups together next week for formal
cease-fire talks.

<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Coup leaders on Thursday released the
remaining 18 captives, ending a two-month-old parliamentary hostage
crisis that has spawned increasing unrest in Fiji.
</P>
<P>
   The hostage-takers held a traditional ceremony seeking
forgiveness, then rebel leader George Speight shook hands and
hugged deposed Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry before allowing
him, former Cabinet members and other hostages to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're all out,'' said military spokesman Maj. Howard
Politini.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 Speight supporters cheered as the hostages left. The

</P>
<P>
   The release followed a deal Sunday, when the military agreed to
scrap the country's multiracial constitution, depose Chaudhry --
Fiji's first prime minister of ethnic Indian descent -- and grant
Speight and his henchmen amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   The military seized control May 29 following violence and
looting in the wake of the raid by Speight's gang 10 days earlier
on Parliament. Speight's rebels are ethnic Fijians who say the
Indian minority has too much power.
</P>
<P>
   The unrest has increased in recent days, possibly to take
advantage of the amnesty offer. Protesters seized two more tourists
resorts elsewhere Thursday, bringing the number held to four, the
military said.
</P>
<P>
   The seizures of the Buca Bay and Rukuruku resorts, which
appeared peaceful, came hours after the takeover of the upscale
Laucala Island resort and a day after the occupation of the Turtle
Island Resort where ''The Blue Lagoon'' was filmed.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear if the takeovers were part of Speight's efforts
to pressure the Great Council of Chiefs, Fiji's traditional power,
to endorse his proposed Cabinet for an interim government or if his
campaign was spiraling out of control.
</P>
<P>
   The chiefs began meeting Thursday morning to choose a new
president and vice president in line with the agreement signed
Sunday and aimed at freeing the 18 remaining hostages in
Parliament. Nine were released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Laucala Island, owned by late American media magnate Malcolm
Forbes, was put up for sale last year by his estate. It has been
closed for several months, and no tourists were staying at the
pricey resort. Both Buca Bay and Rukuruku aim at the lower end of
the market. It was unclear how many tourists were at each one.
Forty tourists at Turtle Island Resort were released hours after
that takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Incidents of unrest have increased in recent days but most have
been peaceful, although five police officers were injured in a
police station takeover Wednesday at Labasa, which has turned into
a hotbed of Speight support.
</P>
<P>
   But there were growing concerns that the takeovers could spread,
possibly to Fiji's international airport near Nadi. The road from
Nadi to Suva has been blockaded, so disruption of the Nadi airport
also would essentially isolate the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The United States upgraded a travel advisory Thursday urging
Americans to leave the country. It cited the ongoing unrest ''and
the inability of local authorities to respond to these problems.''
Last week, Washington recalled the U.S. ambassador for
consultations.
</P>
<P>
   Speight was meeting with the chiefs, the final hurdle in his aim
of overturning the Pacific country's elected government and
installing his own after already forcing a backdown by the military
regime.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything that is happening in the country at the moment is
putting pressure on the chiefs,'' rebel spokesman Jo Nata said
Wednesday. ''Suva is almost under siege, the whole nation is in
chaos. Isn't that what you'd call holding a gun against the heads
of the chiefs?''
</P>
<P>
   Speight has said the protesters are acting independently, but in
support of what he says is his cause -- indigenous Fijian rights.
But some of the disturbances clearly had little to do with
Speight's aims.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen guards were taken hostage on Tuesday by about 50
inmates in the maximum-security ward of Naboro prison, near the
capital, Suva. Police and soldiers deployed around the facility.
</P>
<P>
   Indo-Fijians, whose ancestors were brought to the islands by
British colonialists over a century ago to work in the rich sugar
cane fields, make up 44 percent of Fiji's 812,000 people. Many
indigenous Fijians, who make up 51 percent of the population,
resent the Indo-Fijians' economic and political clout.

<HEADLINE> Senate Votes on Missile Testing  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Concerned by failures in past testing, the
Senate is voting on a measure that would require more thorough
future testing before the Pentagon could build a national
anti-missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is it too much to ask that we be certain that this system
works before we move ahead with deployment?'' said Sen. Paul
Wellstone, D-Minn.
</P>
<P>
   In an amendment to a $310 billion bill authorizing defense
programs, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., is demanding that the Pentagon
test the system against countermeasures an adversary might use to
stop it.
</P>
<P>
   Such countermeasures, which are used to disguise incoming
warheads and confuse missiles launched to destroy them, could
include decoy balloons and nuclear warheads shrouded in cooled
metal, Durbin said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, argued that the Durbin amendment was unnecessary because
the Pentagon is already including the effects of countermeasures in
its experiments.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has set a timetable for having a national
anti-missile defense system ready for initial deployment by the end
of 2005. Estimates of the cost of building that system, which would
be designed only to counter very limited attacks from such hostile
nations as North Korea, run as high as $60 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed system is also strongly opposed by nuclear weapons
nations such as Russia and China, which say it violates the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty limiting missile defense systems.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those obstacles, there is strong sentiment in Congress
for proceeding with research and development of the defense system.
</P>
<P>
   But Durbin argued that ''once that system becomes operational it
should work.'' He said that ''if the fate of Americans will truly
hang in the balance, we owe this nation, and every family and every
mother father and child, our very best effort in building a
credible effective deterrence.''
</P>
<P>
   His amendment also requires an independent review team convened
by the defense secretary to assess whether enough tests are
conducted to assure the effectiveness of the system before it
becomes operational.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has said he would decide soon whether to keep
the project moving toward the 2005 target date for deployment, but
that decision may be postponed because of a failed missile
intercept test over the Pacific last week. The device that was
supposed to destroy an incoming missile in the test did not
separate from its booster rocket.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second failure out of three tests of the intercept
program.
</P>
<P>
   The defense authorization bill, which the Senate was to vote on
Thursday, would provide $1.9 billion for the National Missile
Defense program, more than double the amount authorized in fiscal
2000.
</P>
<P>
   The bill budgets nearly $310 billion, $4.5 billion more than the
president requested and $19 billion more than the current year, for
weapons procurement, military readiness and personnel.
</P>
<P>
   It includes a 3.7 percent pay raise for members of the military,
$64 billion for procurement and $4.1 billion for operations in
Bosnia, Kosovo and Southwest Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill also includes an amendment, sponsored by Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., to add offenses motivated by sexual
orientation, sex or disability to the list of hate crimes covered
under federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The House version has provisions to improve the health care
coverage of military retirees and expand their access to
prescription drugs.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Chided on Foreign Policy  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen accused China's
state-controlled media of presenting a dangerously distorted view
of U.S. foreign policy goals, but in an unscripted moment, he
agreed with a Chinese woman's complaint that U.S. news media
sometime do the same to China.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the National Defense University, a school for
officers of the People's Liberation Army, Cohen said China
''sometimes presents the United States in a way that is not only
unhelpful but is untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The characterization of the United States being a hegemon, a
country determined to dominate the world and to contain and
dominate China, is simply untrue,'' he said. ''We see constant
references in the Chinese media'' to the United States that amount
to ''hyperbole or criticism or negativity.''
</P>
<P>
   In a portion of his prepared remarks that he dropped in the
delivery, Cohen referred to a ''confrontational rhetoric'' by China
that assigns hostile motives to American foreign policy goals. He
said this presents a ''danger that simple misunderstandings will
lead to serious miscalculations.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen seemed to be referring to China's frequent assertion that
the United States, by stationing troops in Asia, allying itself
with Japan and providing arms to Taiwan, seeks to stifle China and
dominate Asia.
</P>
<P>
   China also views U.S. development of a national missile defense
as another means of dominating China -- a claim Cohen rebutted by
saying the system would ''not be designed to address China's
missile capability.''
</P>
<P>
   In a question-and-answer session following his speech, Cohen --
and perhaps many of the Chinese officers in the audience -- were
taken by surprise when a woman seated near Cohen's wife, Janet,
stood and posed a lengthy question which drew a vigorous and
seemingly spontaneous burst of applause.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who described herself as the spouse of an army
official, ignored a uniformed Chinese officer's signal for her to
sit down. She noted Cohen's criticisms of China's media. ''I think
the same problem occurs in the U.S. media,'' she said through an
interpreter, citing specifically U.S. media reporting on human
rights in China. Her comments seemed to catch Cohen off guard.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess I should have cut the questions before you asked your
question,'' Cohen said jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have abuses -- not abuses -- we have a free media in the
United States,'' Cohen said, adding that ''There are some in our
media that characterize or mischaracterize China.'' He said these
distortions ''too often have caused tensions between our two
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's speech focused on the prospects for improved U.S.-China
relations and sought to dispel the notion held by China's leaders
that the United States is trying to ''contain'' China in the way it
approached the former Soviet Union in a cold war of military,
economic and political competition.
</P>
<P>
   He said those in the United States who advocate a containment
policy toward China are pursuing ''folly and futility.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not seek to contain the most populous nation on Earth,''
Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   He also made these other points:
</P>
<P>
   --The U.S. security alliance with Japan is designed to strengthen
stability in Asia, not undermine Chinese interests. ''It is a
defensive alliance that does not isolate or threaten any nation in
the region.''
</P>
<P>
   --The recent summit meeting between the leaders of North and
South Korea was a promising sign. ''There are grounds for hope that
the 50-year confrontation in Korea may be ended if the promise of
the summit is realized.''
</P>
<P>
   --The need for a U.S. national missile defense is driven by the
spread of missile technology to potentially hostile nations.
''Neither the United State nor China -- nor Russia, for that matter
-- can know with certainty what terrorist group or rogue nations may
threaten us with these weapons in the future. But as long as these
weapons of mass destruction spread in ever-widening circles, that
threat will continue to exist.''
</P>
<P>
   --America will not heed calls from some in Asia to withdraw its
troops from the region. ''I would ask you: Who would fill the
vacuum under those circumstances. Would it be China? Would it be
Japan? Would it be India? Would it be Pakistan? Who would rush to
fill the vacuum that would be left by the United States?''

<HEADLINE> Gore Welcomes Back Bill Bradley  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Papering over their acrimonious primary
battle, Vice President Al Gore welcomed fellow Democrat Bill
Bradley back to the presidential campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to have a great day together,'' he enthused to New
Jersey Democrats on the eve of his long-anticipated reunion
Thursday with Bradley at a midday campaign rally in Green Bay, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, in an interview with The Associated Press, Gore
emphasized that he agrees with Bradley on ''most of the issues''
and hopes to tap into his ''huge following around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I listened very carefully to his discussion of the issues in
our primary contest and, in many cases, I have tried to carry
forward the points of view he articulated very well'' on campaign
finance reform and child poverty, Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   In Bradley's New Jersey home turf for a $750,000 pair of
Democratic National Committee fund-raisers Wednesday night, Gore
sounded intent on burying memories of the primary season. That
battle brought out the most aggressive campaigner in Gore, who
distorted his rival's agenda by alternately labeling Bradley a
reckless liberal and someone out to ''shred'' the government's
health-care safety net for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of Thursday's rally, the Republican National
Committee released a greatest-hits list of Bradley's primary-season
gripes about Gore, including: ''You are the elephant of negative
campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore was focused this week on projecting party unity -- at a
time when polls suggest he is having a harder time rallying
Democrats behind him than GOP presidential contender George W. Bush
is having with Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Throughout the primaries, even when they got pretty intense, I
maintained constantly and always that it was an honor to be in the
same race with Bill Bradley,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bradley has maintained a stubborn, almost
reclusive silence since he dropped out of the race March 9 and
tossed his support to Gore. Bradley's refusal -- then and since -- to
use the word ''endorse'' prompted taunts from Republicans and fed
speculation of lingering ill will for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Bradley partisans make clear he has not ruled out a
future presidential bid. To wit, he was in Chicago on Wednesday
night for a ''thank you'' party for supporters to ''keep his
network alive,'' one ally said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser said the former senator from New
Jersey would finally use the ''E'' word on Thursday. ''This will be
an opportunity to formalize an endorsement and talk about why the
vice president is going to make a good president and is the right
choice,'' Hauser said.
</P>
<P>
   There are small hints that bruises remain.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign has not offered work to any of Bradley's top-
or mid-level former aides. And the wide net that Warren Christopher
has cast for counsel as he leads Gore's search for a running mate
has not included Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was Christopher's first meeting in 1992 when he helped
Bill Clinton identify a running mate, but Christopher has not
contacted Bradley at all this time around, Bradley allies said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gore campaign manager Donna Brazile, Bradley also
has yet to release the more than 300 delegates he accumulated
during the presidential primaries, none of which he won.
</P>
<P>
   Brazile called Bradley's hold on the delegates an untroubling
''procedural quirk.''
</P>
<P>
   As the incumbent essentially in control of the Democratic Party,
Gore and his operatives made sure from the start that Bradley's
delegates were denied 20-percent representation on any DNC
committee so they could not force any minority votes at the party
gathering next month in Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> Heat Sabotages Border Crossings  </HEADLINE>
By RAUL LLAMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico (AP) -- After walking for hours in the
sweltering desert heat, Margarita Alvarado had reached the edge of
the Rio Grande -- just yards from the U.S. border -- when she sat
down in the dirt and said she was going to die.
</P>
<P>
   Then she vomited, laid back in the dust, and she was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing I could do was go back and look for help, but
it was too late,'' said her brother-in-law, Juan Manuel Martinez,
19. The 32-year-old woman had reassured him just hours earlier that
she was fine.
</P>
<P>
   The tragic story Tuesday is recounted each year in the
blistering summer months, one of the most dangerous periods for
immigrants to be crossing the desert because temperatures regularly
rise above 100 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Sin Fronteras, a Mexican humanitarian organization that works
with migrants, told the government news agency Notimex this week
that 112 illegal immigrants -- mostly Mexicans -- died since October
trying to enter the United States. That's a jump of 40 percent from
last year, with the worst of the summer heat ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Border Patrol last week announced it is beefing up air
patrols to help find illegal immigrants in distress in Arizona's
deserts, the busiest illegal crossing point along the 2,000-mile
U.S.-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   The patrol has brought seven airplanes from other areas of the
country to Arizona to be used in sweeps along the border during the
next three months.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights activists say increased Border Patrol crackdowns in
California and Texas have driven immigrants to take more dangerous
routes through deserts and mountains to avoid being caught.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are seeing a steady increase that is alarming,'' Liliane
Loya, spokeswoman for Sin Fronteras, told Notimex. ''That tells us
that these are not simply accidental deaths -- that there exists a
clear relation: The deaths go up when control of the border areas
increases.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarado took the harrowing trip to be reunited with her husband
in Dallas, who had been working there as a cook for the past six
months. She was trying to cross into Texas when she died in the
northern state of Tamaulipas.
</P>
<P>
   She and her brother-in-law, who is from the northern Mexican
state of Durango, arrived in Nuevo Laredo on Tuesday morning in
search of a way to cross the border. They paid $40 to a migrant
smuggler who guided them on foot to a desolate region, away from
the cluster of border patrol agents on the other side of the border
in Laredo, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican soldiers they met on the way told them it was too
dangerous to continue in the intense heat. They ignored the
warnings.
</P>
<P>
   When Alvarado passed out, the smuggler and two other migrants
said they would get help once they crossed the border. Martinez
never heard from them again. He opted to abandon the crossing when
she died.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now the only thing left for me is to return,'' he said, ''to
bury the body of my sister-in-law.''

<HEADLINE> Philippines Dump Death Toll Rises  </HEADLINE>
By OLIVER TEVES
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Divina Alano wailed in grief
Wednesday as a mechanical hoe scooped up the body of her father
from a dark garbage-choked pool of water where their house once
stood.
</P>
<P>
   Her eyes were swollen from crying since Monday when a wall of
garbage, softened by heavy rains, crashed down on squatters'
shanties at Manila's largest garbage dump.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll climbed to 135 Thursday, and officials said
another 160 were still missing following the tragedy at the Payatas
dump that squatters called the Promised Land.
</P>
<P>
   At an open basketball court, Alano's mother, Gloria, made the
grim identification of her husband, Guillermo, whom she recognized
only by his short graying hair and pants. His face was disfigured.
</P>
<P>
   There was still no word about three missing family members.
</P>
<P>
   Dry-eyed, Rodito Camingawan waited at the basketball court for
volunteers to bring in the body of his wife; their son, 7; and
daughter, 6.
</P>
<P>
   The former cook said his family had been preparing to evacuate
early Monday because the water from a nearby creek was rising.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was looking for a neighbor to help us but when I returned
everything was gone, everything was covered,'' he said. ''I'll wait
until they stop digging, and if they stop before finding them,
there's nothing more I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Col. Jaime Canatoy, in charge of about 300 soldiers searching
for victims, said the military has been ordered to continue the
search until all have been found.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem is we do not know the exact figure of missing
people,'' Canatoy said.
</P>
<P>
   After digging for two days, rescuers largely gave up hope
Wednesday of finding more survivors. Canatoy said the methane gas
produced by the garbage would soon kill anyone buried under the
waste.
</P>
<P>
   The Alanos and Camingawans were among hundreds of squatter
families relocated about 10 years ago to part of the hilly Payatas
district of Quezon City in metropolitan Manila.
</P>
<P>
   ''We used to look downhill on the garbage dump, but it's grown
so much that now it towers above us,'' said Virgie Dimpal, a
neighborhood leader.
</P>
<P>
   The garbage mountain now stands about seven stories high and
occupies 74 acres.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a man-made calamity. This is not a natural calamity,''
she said, blaming officials for letting the dump grow too high.
</P>
<P>
   Quezon City Mayor Ishmael Mathay said the city plans to move
about 300 families whose houses were destroyed to nearby Rizal
province.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said all Payatas residents
should be relocated. ''We cannot allow people to live so
dangerously under the shadow of death in this dump site,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a smaller portion of the mountain of garbage
collapsed during heavy rains, but no one was injured or killed.
</P>
<P>
   The Payatas dump, along with a former dump in Manila's Tondo
slum district called Smokey Mountain, long has symbolized the
wrenching poverty in the Philippines.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   CLIFTON, N.J. (AP) - A Paterson man charged in Wednesday's
robbery of a Clifton bank may be responsible for a string of North
Jersey bank robberies, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Sheppard, 46, was arrested minutes after the robbery at
the Clifton Savings Bank on Valley Road. Authorities say $1,830 in
cash was taken during the robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Carroll, an FBI spokeswoman, said Sheppard will be
arraigned in U.S. District Court in Newark on Thursday on charges
related to the Clifton robbery and robberies at the Dime Savings
Bank in Paterson on April 17 and Fleet Bank in Fair Lawn on June
22.
</P>
<P>
   Police and FBI officials are probing if Sheppard was involved in
the recent robberies of the First Union Bank in Paterson and the
Clifton Savings Bank in the city's Botany Village section.

<HEADLINE> Evolution Trial Heats Up Again  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID MILES
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) -- The audience was encouraged to applaud,
murmur, hiss or shout hallelujah. One sign on stage simply called
for ''hubbub'' -- not surprising, given the subject being debated.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-five years after the Scopes ''monkey trial'' over the
teaching of evolution, parts of the landmark court case were
re-enacted in Kansas, the latest ground zero in the battle over
what to teach kids about the origin of life.
</P>
<P>
   As about 1,500 people watched, actors read from transcripts of
the 1925 trial in Tennessee that pitted William Jennings Bryan
against defense attorney Clarence Darrow.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome was never in doubt. Biology teacher John Scopes was
convicted and fined $100 for teaching evolution. His conviction was
later overturned by the Tennessee Supreme Court on procedural
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   One exchange elicited both laughter and applause. Bryan, played
by Ed Asner (''Lou Grant,'' ''Mary Tyler Moore Show''), turned to
his colleague and said: ''You may guess -- evolutionists guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Darrow, played by James Cromwell (''Babe,'' ''L.A.
Confidential''), replied, ''But when we do guess, we have the sense
to guess right.''
</P>
<P>
   The People for the American Way Foundation sponsored the event
as well as a panel discussion and debate on evolution and
creationism following the performance.
</P>
<P>
   Foundation president Ralph Neas said the state education board's
decision in August 1999 to de-emphasize evolution in science
testing standards made Kansas a natural venue for the event.
</P>
<P>
   ''How Kansas resolves this dispute will ripple out in all
directions to affect the education of millions of children who have
never even set foot in this state,'' Neas said.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution, first propounded by Charles Darwin, states that the
Earth is billions of years old and that life forms developed over
millions of years.
</P>
<P>
   Creationism, or creation science, teaches that the Earth and
most life forms came into existence suddenly about 6,000 years ago.
Critics have attacked it as a disguise for a literal translation of
the Bible's Book of Genesis.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup Poll conducted last year found that 68 percent of
American adults favored teaching both creationism and evolution in
the public schools. By a margin of 55 percent to 40 percent, they
opposed replacing evolution with creationism. The margin of error
was plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has heated up recently in a number of states,
including Alabama, Idaho, Nebraska, New Mexico, West Virginia,
Arizona, Michigan, Indiana, Louisiana, Kentucky, Oklahoma,
Illinois, Washington and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Neas said activities in those states have ranged from efforts to
delete evolution from science standards and tests to including a
disclaimer in textbooks downplaying the importance of the theory.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, the science standards that de-emphasize evolution
also make no mention of the big-bang theory of the origin of the
universe. The standards are used to develop statewide tests for
students.
</P>
<P>
   The board's decision to approve them focused national attention
on Kansas and made evolution a political issue. Five of the board's
10 seats will be filled in the Nov. 7 general election.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Holloway, who was the board's chairwoman when it approved
the new science standards and is seeking re-election, said that
while the evolution debate continues 75 years after the Scopes
trial, creationists are the ones under attack now.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've come 180 degrees; now we've got censorship the other
way,'' Holloway said Tuesday at the board's monthly meeting. She
did not attend Wednesday's event, which drew people on both sides
of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Krebs, representing Kansas Citizens for Science,
distributed fliers criticizing the Kansas board's decision, while
Eric and Celtie Johnson displayed anti-evolution signs. One said,
''Reject evolution, thousands of scientists do!''
</P>
<P>
   Before the re-creation, Kansas native Asner said scientists have
accumulated evidence in ''a million different ways'' to support
evolution since the Scopes trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kansas has put itself in a more bumbling situation with this
board than Tennessee was 75 years ago,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Woman Charged With Giving Away Son  </HEADLINE>
By DON THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A California woman has been charged
with giving her 10-year-old son to someone she met on the Internet
because she could no longer cope with his misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   The woman arranged to give the boy away nearly three months ago
to a Florida man she knew only as Gus, then moved to another town,
said Vacaville Police Detective Patrick Cowan.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was found apparently unharmed over the weekend and will
be sent back to California, Cowan said.
</P>
<P>
   The child's mother, Helen Chase, 29, has posted $1,000 bond on
charges of child endangerment, child abandonment and failure to
provide for a child. No hearing date has been set.
</P>
<P>
   There was no home telephone number listed for Chase, and police
did not have a lawyer listed for her.
</P>
<P>
   ''She told us basically, yeah, she was having trouble with her
10-year-old -- problems at school, that sort of thing -- really
typical 10-year-old stuff,'' Cowan said. ''She just decided she
couldn't deal with this kid and wanted to adopt him out -- which is
kind of unusual in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase told police she attempted to have the boy adopted in
December after he had what Cowan described as minor disciplinary
problems. Cowan said police can find no record of any adoption
official talking with her.
</P>
<P>
   In January, she began searching computer chat rooms and met
Gustaf Sjoberg of St. Petersburg, Fla., who wanted to adopt a
7-year-old boy, Cowan said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's behavior improved temporarily after Chase told him she
was planning to send him away, Cowan said. In February, however,
she told police she could no longer deal with her son and arranged
for Sjoberg to come get him on April 20.
</P>
<P>
   Chase immediately moved to Elmira, 11 miles east of Vacaville,
telling school officials her son was moving with her, Cowan said.
He said police were alerted Friday by a stepson who told them ''his
stepmother had given away his stepbrother.''
</P>
<P>
   Sjoberg and his wife, Deborah, were cooperative but upset when
police took the boy away early Saturday, said St. Petersburg Police
spokesman Dan Bates, quoting a police report: ''They said they were
seeing how (the boy) did living with them before they started the
adoption process.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sjobergs did not return a telephone message left at their
home.
</P>
<P>
   They have four other adopted children in addition to a child
born to Gustaf Sjoberg, Cowan said. No charges are pending against
the couple, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy is staying in a Florida foster home. He will likely be
placed in a foster home when he returns California, Cowan said,
although child services workers are attempting to reach his father,
who is in a state prison. Police did not have any further details
about the father.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wants to come home,'' Cowan said of the boy. ''He does want
to be with his mom. It's pretty amazing what kids can go through
and still want to be with a parent.''

<HEADLINE> Fisherman Nets Catch of Alcohol  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Fisherman Olaf Iversen thought he had made
the catch of the season when his nets began straining under a heavy
load while he was trawling for shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   It was a big catch, at least for the local customs office:
Iversen landed about 1,640 gallons of smuggled alcohol, making
national headlines Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had laid out the net, and was pulling it in when I saw that
there were a lot of oil barrels hanging on the net,'' Iversen was
quoted as telling Norway's largest newspaper, Verdens Gang.
</P>
<P>
   The 31 barrels were tied together underwater about 15 miles from
Stavern, a town in southern Norway. Iversen caught them Tuesday. He
summoned the coast guard when he realized what they contained.
</P>
<P>
   Customs officials said a ship may have dropped the contraband
and expected accomplices to collect it later. It was also possible
that smugglers lost the cargo or dumped it for other reasons,
police said. They said they had no suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Norway has some of the world's highest alcohol prices as a
result of high taxes meant to discourage drinking. The prices have
led to widespread smuggling.

<HEADLINE> Alec Baldwin Stars in 'Nuremberg'  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Get Alec Baldwin talking about his miniseries
''Nuremberg'' and he has plenty to say about Nazi atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   But however heartfelt his abhorrence of the Holocaust, Baldwin
wasn't drawn to ''Nuremberg'' by a desire to make a humanitarian
statement. Instead, he liked the dramatic conflict at the film's
core: two men in a duel of beliefs. (''Nuremberg'' airs Sunday and
Monday at 8 p.m. Eastern on TNT.)
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin plays Robert Jackson, an associate justice of the United
States Supreme Court who in 1945 was dispatched by President Truman
to the war-ravaged city of Nuremberg, Germany. There, Jackson would
be the lead prosecutor in a trial of 21 members of the Nazi high
command for war crimes committed by the Third Reich.
</P>
<P>
   Championing a civilized world, Jackson held all these men
accountable for the Nazis' ''mad and melancholy record'' against
the Jews. But the key defendant was Hermann Goering, notorious as
Hitler's second-in-command. As Jackson's bete noire, Goering was
charming, demonic and seemingly impenetrable.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a kind of tortoise-and-the-hare story,'' Baldwin says.
''Jackson arrives in Germany not quite certain what the
significance of the trial is. Then he goes into the courtroom
ill-prepared as a trial lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the same time, enter Goering, who has 1000 percent
mathematical certainty of who he is and why he's there and what he
wants to say on the stand. And the game is afoot.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not to suggest that ''Nuremberg'' reduces the ensuing
courtroom combat to a two-man grudge match. For Jackson, who was
responsible for organizing the trial literally from the ground up
in the rubble of Nuremberg, the whole experience unfolds as one of
awful discovery -- as it does for anyone watching this powerful
film.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nuremberg'' has a splendid cast that, besides Baldwin,
includes Max von Sydow, Christopher Plummer, Brian Cox as Goering,
and, as Jackson's beloved assistant Elsie Douglas, former ''Law &AMP;
Order'' cast member Jill Hennessy.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Yves Simoneau from a script by David W. Rintels,
''Nuremberg'' is deliberative and unhurried, with a plush, mannerly
look that makes the wartime devastation seem all the more barbaric.
</P>
<P>
   This contrast is perhaps most pronounced in the scene when
just-acquired film of liberated Nazi death camps is entered into
evidence. Unreeling for four full minutes in the imposing, newly
reconstructed courtroom, this silent footage takes ghastly hold.
</P>
<P>
   As horrible as anything yet captured on film, the
black-and-white images sicken you today. But, chances are, you have
seen them before. Moreover, you view them from a half-century's
distance. For a 1940s courtroom audience, this unexpected footage
has shocking, graphic immediacy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Goering appears unmoved. ''Propaganda,'' he scoffs as
he is led from the courtroom back to his jail cell. ''Anyone can do
it. A little of this, a little of that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Elsie Douglas, clearly jolted, voices a more typical
response. ''How,'' she asks Jackson, ''could civilized human beings
do that to other civilized human beings?''
</P>
<P>
   He grimly replies, ''Maybe civilization is overrated.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the darker message of ''Nuremberg,'' which Baldwin is
discussing in a Manhattan hotel suite. Nattily dressed in a blue
suit befitting his film role, he munches gourmet M&AMP;Ms seized from
the mini-bar, explaining that he needs a sugar fix.
</P>
<P>
   Thus fortified, he describes the man he portrayed. ''Jackson was
a hero who left the comforts of postwar Washington and the Supreme
Court bench to go to war-torn Germany and explore the horrors of
the Nazi soul,'' Baldwin says admiringly. ''And with little
acclaim.''
</P>
<P>
   The yearlong hearing was conducted by an international military
tribunal of judges from the United States, Britain, France and the
Soviet Union. Nineteen defendants, including Goering, were found
guilty. Thirteen, Goering among them, were sentenced to death (but
Goering, ever defiant, committed suicide before his execution could
be carried out).
</P>
<P>
   For Jackson, who insisted that the defendants have a fair trial,
winning those verdicts with an airtight case was a rigorous
process.
</P>
<P>
   As Baldwin explains, ''Jackson's task during that year is to
answer the questions, 'Are the Nazis different from other enemies
in wartime? And if so, how?' In the beginning, he's not sure, and
he doesn't want to prosecute people simply for atrocities, because
any war is one big atrocity.''
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Jackson and his associates identified three
things that set the Nazis apart as uniquely evil.
</P>
<P>
   ''First was who the German people were in the civilized world,''
says Baldwin, listing his arguments in the present tense that his
character would have used. ''This is not some third-world country.
This is one of the preeminent civilizations in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ''Second, this is not a renegade operation. This is
state-sponsored genocide.
</P>
<P>
   ''And this is not an invading army that is dealing with their
vanquished captors. The Germans perpetrated this against their own
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no measure of justice or vigilance can finally
expunge this kind of evil from the human race. In the film, the
fresh-faced young American who guards Goering's cell grows in his
respect for the unrepentant Nazi. He promises to carry on the cause
after Goering is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ''That soldier is the spiritual grandfather of neo-Nazis in this
country today,'' Baldwin says. ''We wanted to make sure people
understood very clearly that the message did not only take root in
a German heart and mind and soul.
</P>
<P>
   ''It can take root in anyone, at any time,'' he says. As for
civilization? The jury is still out.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in early trading Thursday, as
investors attempted to digest second-quarter earnings reports.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 25.81 at 10,757.60.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mostly higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was up 0.10 at 1,493.02, and the Nasdaq composite
index was up 33.05 at 4,132.64.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors are acting cautiously in the wake of
Wednesday's rally, which many believe was a so-called technical
rally, or one in which stocks rise temporarily despite broader
trends that indicate stocks may be in a long-term slump.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's rally was spurred by better-than expected
second-quarter earnings report from Internet giant Yahoo!, which
served as a catalyst for a surge in technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The technology sector continued to advance Thursday, led by
Ariba, up 21.065 to 124.563 and Applied Micro Circuits, up 22.75 to
148.19.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues were about even with outnumbered decliners on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 136.94 million
shares, down from Wednesday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 1.74 at 541.99.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.76 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 1.08 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.67 percent, and France's CAC-40 was
up 0.36 percent.

<HEADLINE> Senate Votes on Missile Testing  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate on Thursday turned back a proposal
to require more thorough testing before the Pentagon builds a
national anti-missile defense system, rejecting arguments that more
scrutiny is needed because of past test failures.
</P>
<P>
   In a 52-48 vote, the Senate defeated an amendment to a $310
billion bill authorizing defense programs that would have required
that the Pentagon test the proposed missile-killing system against
countermeasures an adversary might use to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., a leading advocate of the national
missile defense system, said the testing proposal by Sen. Dick
Durbin, D-Ill., was an ''unprecedented effort by the Senate to
micromanage a weapons system testing program. In no other program
has the Senate tried to legislate in this way, to dictate to the
Department of Defense how a classified national security testing
program should be conducted.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., in support of the amendment,
asked, ''Is it too much to ask that we be certain that this system
works before we move ahead with deployment?''
</P>
<P>
   Durbin said that to prove the effectiveness of the defense
shield, it was necessary to test it against countermeasures used to
disguise incoming warheads and confuse missiles launched to destroy
them. Those could include decoy balloons and nuclear warheads
shrouded in cooled metal, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, argued that the Durbin amendment was unnecessary because
the Pentagon is already including the effects of countermeasures in
its experiments.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has set a timetable for having a national
anti-missile defense system ready for initial deployment by the end
of 2005. Estimates of the cost of building that system, which would
be designed only to counter very limited attacks from such hostile
nations as North Korea, run as high as $60 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed system is also strongly opposed by nuclear weapons
nations such as Russia and China, which say it violates the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty limiting missile defense systems.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those obstacles, there is strong sentiment in Congress
for proceeding with research and development of the defense system.
</P>
<P>
   But Durbin argued that ''once that system becomes operational it
should work.'' He said that ''if the fate of Americans will truly
hang in the balance, we owe this nation, and every family and every
mother father and child, our very best effort in building a
credible effective deterrence.''
</P>
<P>
   His amendment also requires an independent review team convened
by the defense secretary to assess whether enough tests are
conducted to assure the effectiveness of the system before it
becomes operational.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has said he would decide soon whether to keep
the project moving toward the 2005 target date for deployment, but
that decision may be postponed because of a failed missile
intercept test over the Pacific last week. The device that was
supposed to destroy an incoming missile in the test did not
separate from its booster rocket.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second failure out of three tests of the intercept
program.
</P>
<P>
   The defense authorization bill, which the Senate passed Thursday
by 97-3, would provide $1.9 billion for the National Missile
Defense program, more than double the amount authorized in fiscal
2000.
</P>
<P>
   The bill budgets nearly $310 billion, $4.5 billion more than the
president requested and $19 billion more than the current year, for
weapons procurement, military readiness and personnel.
</P>
<P>
   It includes a 3.7 percent pay raise for members of the military,
$64 billion for procurement and $4.1 billion for operations in
Bosnia, Kosovo and Southwest Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill also includes an amendment, sponsored by Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., to add offenses motivated by sexual
orientation, sex or disability to the list of hate crimes covered
under federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The House version has provisions to improve the health care
coverage of military retirees and expand their access to
prescription drugs.

<HEADLINE> Songwriters Name 'In My Life' Best  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A group of legendary pop songwriters has named the
Beatles' ''In My Life'' as the greatest song ever written.
</P>
<P>
   The autobiographical John Lennon song, which appeared on the
1965 ''Rubber Soul'' album, beat the Rolling Stones'
''Satisfaction'' to lead the list, which was compiled from top ten

<HEADLINE> Cat Stevens Deported From Israel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The man who gained fame as pop star Cat Stevens
was denied entry into Israel and deported hours after arriving,
officials said Thursday -- reportedly because he gave money to a
militant Islamic group during his last visit.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Ministry officials refused to comment on Yusuf Islam's
case other than to say that the Shin Bet, Israel's internal
intelligence agency, had ordered the man who wrote such songs as
''Peace Train'' and ''Wild World'' barred from the country.
</P>
<P>
   Islam, 51, who changed his name after becoming a Muslim in the
late 1970s, last visited Israel in 1988. The government claims that
during that trip he delivered tens of thousand of dollars to Hamas,
a militant Islamic group, the Maariv daily reported.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, in 1990, he tried to enter again along with his
8-year-old son but was barred.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the former singer arrived at 2:30 a.m. Wednesday and
was detained by airport authorities when his name appeared on a
list of people banned from Israel, Maariv reported. It quoted him
as telling an Israeli entertainment show, ''They locked me in a
two-meter by two-meter cell without water or a bathroom, and then
deported me. I don't see any reason for this to happen in a time of
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Airport authorities denied that the former singer was
mistreated, Maariv said. They said he was kept in the departure
lounge until the plane he arrived on returned to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The former singer, who was born Stephen Georgiou, took Cat
Stevens as a stage name and had a string of hits in the early
1970s. He abandoned his music career in 1977 and changed his name
after being persuaded by orthodox Muslim teachers that his
lifestyle was forbidden by Islamic law.
</P>
<P>
   He later began teaching and actively spreading the word of his
religion, founding a Muslim school in 1983. He made headlines when
he supported the death sentence issued by Iran against author
Salman Rushdie.

<HEADLINE> Dow Slips 5 As Nasdaq Climbs 68  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in early trading Thursday, as
investors attempted to digest second-quarter earnings reports.
</P>
<P>
   In late morning on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average
was down 5.30 at 10,778.11.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 3.64 at 1,496.56, and the Nasdaq composite index was
up 68.61 at 4,168.20.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors moved cautiously in the wake of
Wednesday's rally, which many believe was a so-called technical
rally, or one in which stocks rise temporarily despite broader
trends that indicate stocks may be in a long-term slump.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Harrington, technical analyst with Wachovia Securities in
Charlotte, N.C., said investors have apparently taken temporary
comfort in the fact that energy prices appear to have stabilized
and the overall feeling that the Federal Reserve Board may be
fishished raising interest rates for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence of the cautious environmen, however, the Dow Jones
average was down slightly despite solid earnings reports from
General Electric and J.P. Morgan. General Electric was down $1 at
$52.50, while J.P. Morgan shares rose $2.69 to $125.25.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's rally was spurred by better-than expected
second-quarter earnings report from Internet giant Yahoo!, which
served as a catalyst for a surge in technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The technology sector continued to advance Thursday, led by
Ariba, up 20.375 to 123.875 and Applied Micro Circuits, up 24.312
to 149.75.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues were slightly ahead of decliners on the New
York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 325.59 million shares, up
from Wednesday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 1.62 at 541.87.

<HEADLINE> Running Red Lights Kills 800 A Year  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 800 people die and some 200,000
people are injured each year in the United States because of
lead-footed drivers who press the gas pedal to the floor when a
traffic light turns red, an insurance industry study says.
</P>
<P>
   The report to be released Thursday by the Insurance Institute
for Highway Safety found that between 1992 and 1998, almost 6,000
people died in such crashes, and more than half of them were
pedestrians and occupants of other vehicles hit by red light
runners.
</P>
<P>
   Another 2,779 deaths occurred in the vehicles running the red
lights. During the same period, about 1.5 million people were
injured.
</P>
<P>
   ''Red light running is more than just a form of aggressive
driving. People are dying and getting hurt needlessly because of
it,'' said Ed Rust Jr., chairman of the institute and chief
executive of State Farm Insurance, said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the institute studied data from the
Transportation Department and found that fatal crashes at traffic
signals increased 18 percent from 1992 and 1998, more than three
times the rate of increase for all other fatal crashes during that
time.
</P>
<P>
   In each state, the researchers examined the rate of red light
running deaths per 100,000 residents and determined that the states
with the highest death rate were Arizona, with a rate of 7.1
deaths; Nevada with 3.9; Michigan with 3.7; Texas with 3.5; and
Alabama with 3.4.
</P>
<P>
   Among cities, the rate was highest in Phoenix, with 10.8 deaths
per 100,000 people, followed by Memphis, Tenn., with a rate of 8.0;
Mesa, Ariz., with a rate of 7.8 deaths; Tucson, Ariz., and St.
Petersburg, Fla., both with a rate of 7.6 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   In releasing the data, the institute endorsed the use of red
light cameras, which photograph vehicles running red lights and
ticket violators by mail. Such programs, used in about 40 U.S.
communities, reduce red light running by about 40 percent,
according to the institute.
</P>
<P>
   However, privacy advocates, including the American Civil
Liberties Union, have expressed concerns about how the cameras are
used.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't opposed cameras for the specific use enforcing
traffic violations,'' said Barry Steinhardt, associate director of
the American Civil Liberties Union. ''We are concerned about
mission creep, that these cameras will be used for other purposes,
and it's classically true that surveillance techniques created for
one purpose are rarely restricted to that purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian O'Neill, president of the insurance institute, said red
light cameras have been used for years effectively in Europe. They
cost about $60,000 for each intersection.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a driver behavior problem,'' O'Neill said. ''The
purpose of red light cameras is not to write tickets. It's to deter
the behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   He described the cameras as ''exceedingly accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If it's done correctly we will have a good deterrent against
this behavior,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> G-8 Foreign Ministers Praise Koreas  </HEADLINE>
By JOJI SAKURAI
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIYAZAKI, Japan (AP) -- Foreign Ministers from the world's
industrial powers on Thursday praised the thawing of ties on the
Korean Peninsula and pledged to prevent the sources of global
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   During two days of talks to prepare for the July 21-23 summit of
G-8 leaders on Okinawa, the ministers agreed on measures to snuff
out conflicts before they erupt and to limit suffering when it
breaks out.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is very important for G-8 countries to change their
attitude to war and conflict,'' said Canadian Foreign Minister
Lloyd Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
   The steps outlined in a joint communique included blocking
shipments of light weapons, keeping children out of battlefields,
fighting the illegal trade of diamonds in Africa, training an
international civil police force and promoting economic development
in the Third World.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright remained at home because
of the Mideast peace summit at Camp David and sent her deputy,
Strobe Talbott, instead.
</P>
<P>
   While discussing a wide range of global flash points from the
Balkans to the Mideast, the ministers gave particular emphasis this
year to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   They highlighted the June summit between South Korean President
Kim Dae-jung and the North's Kim Jong Il in which the two leaders
agreed to work toward reunification as a major contribution to
stability.
</P>
<P>
   ''We welcome the recent steps taken by North Korea toward
dialogue with the international community,'' the ministers said in
their communique.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they urged the Stalinist North, with its missile and
nuclear weapons programs, to take a ''constructive response to
international concerns over security, nonproliferation,
humanitarian and human rights issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Talbott warned at a press conference following the meeting:
''The North Korea missile threat is a reality, a reality
particularly palpable to host Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   The ministers also expressed ''concern'' about constitutional
amendments in Yugoslavia that would allow President Slobodan
Milosevic to run for another term and downgrade Montenegro's status
in the federation with Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The wording was considerably softer than many had expected. But
Igor Ivanov, the foreign minister of traditional Serbian ally
Russia, said, ''The wording chosen in the document reflects a
serious approach.''
</P>
<P>
   The ministers lauded Indonesia's efforts to implement economic
and democratic reforms and said they would support efforts to
stabilize provinces torn by ethnic and religious strife.
</P>
<P>
   The ministers also stressed their commitment to strengthening
the U.N. Security Council, a victory for Japan which has been
lobbying for a permanent seat.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign ministers held a breakfast meeting with
representatives of developing countries before holding their last
round of discussions at this southern seaside resort.
</P>
<P>
   The G-8 ministers made a commitment to work with Third World
countries on alleviating poverty, bridging the digital divide and
preventing the spread of infectious diseases such as AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was the first dialogue with developing countries in
the context of a gather of the G-8, which consists of the United
States, Japan, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Russia.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Explodes Near Bangkok Candidate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- A bomb exploded Thursday at a campaign
speech by the leading candidate in next week's election for the
Bangkok governorship, wounding eight people, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb went off about 20 feet from the stage where Samak
Sundaravej, 65, was addressing voters ahead of the July 23 vote.
Samak was not injured.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw an orange flash in front of me and I felt a shaking from
the explosion,'' Samak recounted in an interview with The Nation
television network. ''Someone yelled an electric generator had
exploded.
</P>
<P>
   ''People were running around and I could see some people were
injured and I wondered why there was no blackout. Then someone
shouted it was a bomb and they pulled me out of the area and I got
into a car.''
</P>
<P>
   The injured -- believed to be people listening to the speech or
passers-by -- were taken to two hospitals. Four were admitted
overnight and may require operations to remove shrapnel. The other
four were released after treatment, said Dr. Piya Totemchokechaikan
at Vejthani Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Samak, a longtime Bangkok lawmaker, said he had received a phone
call a few days ago from a man threatening to kill him but he had
not taken the threat seriously. Police were investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Samak leads in polls ahead of the election for governor.
Violence and intimidation are not rare in Thai elections, but this
campaign had not been marred before.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a very dirty thing to do. Whoever did it should be
ashamed,'' Samak said.

<HEADLINE> Norway Approves Gay Clergyman  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG MELLGREN
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Norway's minister of churches has upheld the
appointment of an openly gay clergyman -- a precedent-setting ruling
that defies the state Lutheran church's religious guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Minister of Churches and Education Trond Giske announced
Thursday that he had hired Jens Torstein Olsen. ''He was clearly
the best qualified,'' Giske said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision makes Olsen the first clergyman hired to preach in
the Church of Norway while openly living in a homosexual
relationship. The appointment has caused furious debate that some
fear could split the church.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the church's highest body, the national congress, ruled
that clergy who enter homosexual partnerships could not hold
consecrated jobs. But the church, which counts more 85 percent of
Norway's 4.5 million people as members, has remained locked in an
anguished debate on the topic.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Oslo Bishop's Council, made up of clergy and
church members, voted 4-3 to employ the 51-year-old Olsen even
though he noted on his application that he was living with a gay
partner. Some council members appealed the vote to Giske, a
government official who formally employs state church clergy,
saying the appointment violated the national congress ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Olsen lost a 1988 lawsuit against the church council after it
denied him a preaching job because he was openly living with a man.
He has been fighting to be allowed to preach ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm really looking forward to starting as a chaplain,'' he was
quoted as telling the Norwegian news agency NTB.
</P>
<P>
   After Olsen's selection in June, seven of Norway's 11 bishops
issued a statement strongly opposing the decision. At the time,
head Bishop Odd Bondevik said the appointment could split the
church.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Norway's only female bishop, Rosmarie Kohn, faced a
revolt among her own clergy when she allowed openly lesbian Siri
Sunde to return to the pulpit. Sunde had been barred after she
married her female companion. Gay marriages are legal in Norway,
with all the rights of heterosexual marriages except church
weddings and the right to adopt.

Adventists report adding a million members in a year, elect
leaders
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- The rapidly growing Seventh-day Adventist Church
added 1,090,848 new members in 1999, an increase of nearly 11
percent, and now has a following of more than 11 million, said a
report to the faith's international meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Of those members, 91.6 percent now live outside North America,
where the church originated.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting elected the Rev. Jan Paulsen to a five-year term as
world president. Paulsen, a native of Norway, assumed the post last
year when his predecessor resigned over a church investigation of
his business dealings. The Rev. Don Schneider was chosen new
president of the North American division.
</P>
<P>
   Adventist delegates passed a revised policy on divorce and
remarriage. It says abandonment or physical abuse can justify
divorce. The church permits remarriage only in cases of adultery by
a spouse, but now specifies that this includes incest, child sexual
abuse and homosexual practices.

</P>
<P>
   ELGIN, Ill. (AP) -- A lawyer and conservative lay member of the
United Methodist Church, John Juergensmeyer, has filed
ecclesiastical charges against Chicago Bishop C. Joseph Sprague.
</P>
<P>
   One charge accuses Sprague of promoting writings about Jesus
Christ that Juergensmeyer says violate church doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   Sprague is also charged with joining a pro-gay protest that
disrupted the church's national conference in May, with using
church funds to promote homosexuality and with neglecting proper
church administration.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Sprague declined to comment on the proceedings,
saying they are confidential.
Internal Revenue Service issues warning against churches in
politics
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An election-year advisory from the Internal
Revenue Service warns tax-exempt churches and other charities that
tax policy forbids campaign activity.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS said groups that are exempt under section 50l(c)(3) of
the tax code are ''prohibited from participating or intervening in
any political campaign on behalf of, or in opposition to, any
candidate for public office.''
</P>
<P>
   Banned activities include endorsements, donations, fund-raising
and even programs that are ''nonpartisan and in the public
interest'' but help or hurt a candidate, the IRS stated.
Educational forums that do not take sides are allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Violators could be taxed on non-exempt activity or lose tax
exemption entirely.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS issued similar warnings during the 1992 and 1996
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   In May, a federal appeals court ruled that the IRS was justified
in removing tax exemption from the Church at Pierce Creek in
Binghamton, N.Y., for running 1992 campaign ads attacking Bill
Clinton.
Survey indicates many Muslims are undecided in presidential race
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Council on American-Islamic Relations says
a non-random survey of Muslim activists shows a fourth are
undecided or dissatisfied with candidates in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Some 33 percent favored Al Gore, 28 percent were for George W.
Bush, 7 percent for Pat Buchanan and 5 percent for Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   In the survey, 755 respondents returned questionnaires that were
sent to 800 Islamic organizations and mosques to distribute among
active members.
</P>
<P>
   Though 64 percent backed Republican Party stands on moral issues
like abortion and homosexuality, 31 percent favored the Democrats
and only 17 percent the Republicans, while 43 percent said neither
party reflected Muslim interests.
</P>
<P>
   The council also announced a monthlong national voter
registration drive.

High schoolers study theology at 26 campuses
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Summertime theology study by high school
students, an idea originated at Emory University in 1993, has
expanded by this year to 26 universities and seminaries from
Massachusetts to California.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in Theological Programs for High School Youth are
either considering clergy careers or have an academic interest in
theology.
</P>
<P>
   The program is coordinated by the Atlanta-based Fund for
Theological Education and funded by the Lilly Endowment of
Indianapolis, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   At Emory, a month of course work at the Methodist-related
seminary is oriented to Christianity but Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist

Greek court lifts ban on book on Christ dubbed 'blasphemous'
</P>
<P>
   THESSALONIKI, Greece (AP) -- A book banned after the Greek
Orthodox Church condemned it as ''blasphemous'' is back on sale.
</P>
<P>
   In March, a court for northern Greece temporarily banned sales
of ''M to the Power of N'' by Mimi Androulakis, a former Communist
parliament deputy. That ban has been lifted, pending a final ruling
expected in August.
</P>
<P>
   The book consists of women's fictional dialogues, mostly about
misogyny, and has passages on Jesus Christ's possible sexual
longings for Mary Magdalene.
</P>
<P>
   The injunction was filed by history professor Marios Pylavakis
and two others who argued that Christ's life could not be subject
to fictional reinterpretation.
</P>
<P>
   In June, an Athens court threw out a demand to ban the book.
Evangelist completes 50-day, 50-state preaching tour
</P>
<P>
   PLEASANT GARDEN, N.C. (AP) -- A thousand people clapped and
prayed as evangelist Alex McFarland completed a 50-day preaching
tour to all 50 states with a sermon at his home Baptist church.
</P>
<P>
   McFarland opened his ''Tour of Truth'' May 20 in Hawaii, then
traveled the U.S. mainland in a recreational vehicle, logging
17,000 miles and visiting one church in each state.
</P>
<P>
   McFarland, wife Angie and seven unpaid college interns, computer
specialists and drivers took the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Some days were difficult. On Day 32, lightning fried the
computer modem in Easley, S.C., jeopardizing the tour's live
Internet feed. And a German shepherd bit the evangelist's arm
outside a church in Chase, Md. With teeth marks still fresh,
McFarland delivered his 50th sermon.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a last-ditch attempt by the devil to keep me from
getting my preaching done,'' McFarland said.

<HEADLINE> Religion Today  </HEADLINE>
By KEN THOMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWTON, Iowa (AP) -- In a bowl-shaped meadow with pine trees and
a lake that will serve as the Sea of Galilee, a nonprofit group
hopes to set the stage for nightly performances of the Passion
play, re-enacting the life, death, resurrection and ascension of
Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers envision a stream of buses and tourists making the
pilgrimage up U.S. Highway 6 to the gates of the Promised Land
Retreat, which they hope rivals the success of The Great Passion
Play, an Arkansas outdoor drama that is the nation's largest.
</P>
<P>
   ''I took my children there when they were in grade school -- that
is 26 years ago,'' said Leo Van Elswyk, a leading supporter of the
project and a Jasper County supervisor. ''And it's still going
strong, so I think there's a tremendous potential there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Passion play is performed at nine sites nationally and is a
proven economic engine, sometimes spinning off related attractions
as well as restaurants and motels to serve the throngs of
spectators the performances draw.
</P>
<P>
   In Eureka Springs, Ark., The Great Passion Play has been seen by
5 million people since it opened in 1968. The region also boasts a
Bible Museum, Sacred Arts Center, New Holyland tabernacle tour and
a Christ of the Ozarks statue. Among other major spectacles, the
Black Hills Passion Play in Spearfish, S.D., has an annual
attendance between 60,000 and 70,000 and a winter home in Lake
Wales, Fla.; and The Promise, a play in Glen Rose, Texas, attracts
70,000 to 75,000.
</P>
<P>
   But in order to make the multimillion-dollar Iowa project a
reality, members of the nonprofit organization backing it said they
may seek $100,000 from Iowa's Community Attractions and Tourism
fund.
</P>
<P>
   That idea has set off alarms among some community residents and
civil libertarians, who say such funding would violate the First
Amendment, which guarantees separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're certainly not opposed to them creating something like
this, it's just the taxpayers have no obligation to support a
religious enterprise,'' said Ben Stone, executive director of the
Iowa Civil Liberties Union. ''It should be done with religious
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Elswyk countered that the project would not be the first
time state funds have paid for pursuits that are partly spiritual.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you go to the University of Iowa, for instance, you could
take a course in religion, and the teacher is paid by subsidies
from the state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said a feasibility study conducted in 1997 found that the
proximity to Interstate 80 could help make the attraction one of
the top tourist sites in the state and challenge other Passion
plays for travelers.
</P>
<P>
   The project has the support of Newton Mayor David Aldridge and
members of the county's economic development alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's so unfair to label it strictly religious because there's
a religious aspect to the pageant, certainly ... but there's also a
tremendous economic development,'' Aldridge said.
</P>
<P>
   But others in the county argue the request would favor
Christians over Iowans of other faiths and backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jews and Muslims and Hindus are not going to flock to Jasper
County to see the Passion play,'' said Olen Lambert of Newton.
''Only Christians are going to come.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision will likely be settled once members of the Vision
Iowa Board convene sometime before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The board was created by the Legislature to oversee $300 million
in bonds that will fuel community development and attractions
around the state.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Landess, administrator for the Iowa Tourism office, said
projects will be judged by the Vision Iowa Board based on criteria
including feasibility, economic impact, ability to draw tourists,
geographic location and impact on existing attractions. The Jasper
County project would be treated like any other, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they are an eligible applicant and they score well in those
other areas, that's how these projects have been funded,'' Landess
said.
</P>
<P>
   Van Elswyk stresses that the retreat will be a work in progress.
He hopes the amphitheater and a petting zoo will be in place by
next spring on 13 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Passion play begins its run, organizers hope to add
restaurants and hotels on the remainder of the 230 acres of rolling
hills purchased by the group.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit group has plans for a fund-raiser to coincide with
a statewide bicycle ride's stop in Newton -- which will bring
thousands of cyclists to town. Supporters also hope to attract
money from local churches.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here's an opportunity to leave a legacy to future generations
that has some worth to it. It isn't just entertainment,'' Aldridge
said. ''It's an educational experience.''

<HEADLINE> Thatcher's Handbag Is Auctioned Off  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLINE RNE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher once
described her handbag as the only safe place in Downing Street. But
even the baroness was startled to find her little black Ferragamo
at the center of a fierce bidding war.
</P>
<P>
   Thatcher's leather handbag, bought for about $450 in the 1980s,
sold for $150,000 in the Breast Cancer Care charity's Internet
auction, which closed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''She is quite shocked by the response,'' Thatcher Foundation
spokesman Mark Worthington said as the bids mounted.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, Thatcher and her handbag ruled
Britannia, and her formidable purse became both a symbol of her
conservative philosophy and a dreaded irritant to political foes.
</P>
<P>
   Her legendary attachment led humorists in the 1980s to coin the
verb ''to handbag,'' which the Oxford English Dictionary now
defines as to ''attack verbally, to bully.''
</P>
<P>
   The bag was purchased by investment specialist Ian Rushbrook of
Edinburgh, Scotland, who said he had admired Thatcher's
''willpower, drive and ability'' for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Thatcher liked to strategically station her bag in the center of
the Cabinet table to distract colleagues. During heated debates,
she would snap it open to reveal such items as briefing papers, the
latest copy of Queen Elizabeth II's speech or Britain's 1944
Education Act.
</P>
<P>
   Colleague Nicholas Ridley once dryly suggested during a
committee meeting in which Thatcher was absent: ''Why don't we
start? The handbag is here.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was her icon. It became a symbol of her authority and power
the same way as Churchill with his cigar,'' said Samantha Dawe,
spokeswoman for the auction organizer, handbag.com.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the handbag, Rushbrook will receive a
personalized note on Thatcher's letterhead reading, ''This
Ferragamo bag was used for many special occasions. I would only let
it go for a good cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Thatcher's gift was one of 15 handbags donated by celebrities
during the 10-day auction.
</P>
<P>
   Cherie Blair, a lawyer and the wife of Prime Minister Tony
Blair, offered a zebra-striped purse that went for $735. Model
Jerry Hall's red-and-blue striped handbag sold for $1,080.

<HEADLINE> House Approves Abortion Spending Ban  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democrats took up their annual battle
over abortion after failing in several hours of emotional debate to
win the money President Clinton wants for 40 of the world's poorest
nations.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 221-206 Thursday against removing from the
foreign aid bill a ban on the use of U.S. funds overseas by private
organizations that perform abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ''A vote for this amendment is a vote to spend about $1.3
billion to promote abortion worldwide,'' Rep. Walter B. Jones,
R-N.C., said in opposition to the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why we should we use taxpayers' money ... to fund
international family-planning lobbyists?''
</P>
<P>
   Arguing for the amendment, House Minority Leader Richard A.
Gephardt, D-Mo., called the restriction on funds ''one of many
glaring flaws'' in the overall bill to spend $13.3 billion in the
next fiscal year on foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   ''Another outrageous shortcoming'' of the bill is the cut from
last year in money for fighting the AIDS pandemic, he said. And a
provision to provide only a fraction of the administration's
request for Third World debt forgiveness is ''clearly
inexcusable,'' said Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring a veto threat, the House late Wednesday rejected an
amendment to the bill that would have added $390 million over the
next two years for an international debt program, mostly in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The action left the figure for Third World debt relief at $69
million.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said rejection of the extra money
''condemns countless hundreds of thousands of innocent children to
death by starvation and disease.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a responsibility to help those who have been left
behind,'' said Rep. Nita M. Lowey, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will be judged on how we treat the least among us,'' said
Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Gene Sperling, head of
the president's National Economic Council, told reporters earlier
Wednesday that the amount included in the bill would not meet U.S.
obligations under a program launched last year by the world's
richest industrial countries.
</P>
<P>
   The bill as it stands now would provide $82 million for debt,
including $12.6 million for environmental debt relief and $69
million for the general debt relief of $435 million requested by
the administration for debt relief for 40 of the world's poorest
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president's advisers will recommend that the president
veto the bill,'' Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans argued that under budget caps set earlier this
year the House was not permitted to increase the proposed spending
unless an equivalent amount was cut from some other program.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish we had more but we don't have more,'' said Republican
Rep. Sonny Callahan of Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Frank said denying relief to the world's most needy is the
''cruelest single act of public policy I can recall in 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are creating wealth at a pace unparalleled in the history
of the world,'' he said. ''A relatively small amount of money ...
could alleviate untold sufferings.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are being asked to share what we have with some of the most
needy people in the world,'' said Rep. Danny K. Davis, D-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ''Someday ... I'd like to be part of a Congress that ends
hunger, that ends disease,'' said Rep. Tony P. Hall, D-Ohio. ''We
can end tuberculosis, we can end cholera and we can end polio.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., said Americans can ''be
proud'' of their foreign spending.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's always more money that could be spent. There are
always more things that could be done by government,'' Diaz-Balart
said. ''But I am not ashamed of what the American people, through
their Congress, do in foreign aid.''
</P>
<P>
   The reluctance of Congress to fully fund the U.S. share of the
debt relief package comes at an embarrassing time for Clinton, who
is due to attend this year's annual economic summit next week in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   At last year's summit, the world's seven richest countries -- the
United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada --
pledged to write off $50 billion in debt owed by poor nations.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 4811.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Writer Defends Stoning  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Edward Said, a New York-based Palestinian
writer, has acknowledged throwing stones at Israel's border fence --
but he says it was a harmless act of joy.
</P>
<P>
   Said -- whose writings excoriate Western stereotypes that
diminish Arabs as primitive and violent -- was photographed among
Lebanese who show up daily to celebrate Israel's troop withdrawal
from south Lebanon by stoning the new fence between the countries.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has complained the stonings violate the U.N. resolutions
that mandated the end of its 18-year occupation of south Lebanon.
Since the troop withdrawal in May, several soldiers and others have
been injured in the stonings.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement dated July 6 and faxed to Jerusalem on Wednesday
from his Columbia University office, Said acknowledged he was the
man in sunglasses tossing stones on July 3.
</P>
<P>
   He says the crowd threw stones only to see ''whether ... they
could reach the barbed wire.''
</P>
<P>
   ''For a moment I joined in: the spirit of the place infected
everyone with the same impulse, to make a symbolic gesture of joy
that the occupation had ended,'' Said wrote. ''One stone tossed
into an empty place scarcely warrants a second thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Said said that before arriving at the fence, he spent the day
seeing and hearing evidence of human rights abuses carried out by
the Israelis and their allies in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Much is now made of an incident that is basically trivial, as
if that could ever outweigh the work I have done over 35 years on
behalf of justice and peace, or that it could even be compared in
the same breath with the enormous ravages and suffering caused by
decades of military occupation and dispossession,'' Said wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''Orientalism,'' Said's seminal work published in the late
1970s, described how ancient bigotries toward Arabs and other
non-Westerners persist in the West.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Said advocated dialogue with Israelis as
inevitable and even constructive. However, he turned against
Palestinian leaders after the beginning of peace talks in 1993,
saying they were lured into giving up too much in exchange for
little more than minimal recognition.

<HEADLINE> Russian Said Restricting Media  </HEADLINE>
By NICK WADHAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- A pattern of intimidation and pressure on the
Russian media casts doubt on President Vladimir Putin's stated
intention to protect press freedoms, an international delegation of
free press advocates said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The group, speaking after three days of talks with government
officials, journalists and publishers, said Putin has done little
to back up his remarks that a free press is crucial for a healthy
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Putin's stated goals are far from the reality in Russia
today,'' said a statement from the Russian Press Freedom Support
Group, made up of representatives from six international free press
groups. ''There is not a truly free and independent media in
Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent address, Putin stressed his commitment to protecting
media freedom. Media Minister Mikhail Lesin, recently named enemy
No. 1 by free press advocates for his belief that the government
must be able to protect itself against media slander, insisted
Wednesday that there was no media censorship in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Izvestia newspaper released Thursday
ahead of publication, Putin said he strongly supported free press,
but acknowledged that some outlets, hampered by high printing
costs, couldn't survive without working in someone else's
interests.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the government wants (mass media) to be a really
independent, democratic instrument for the development of society,
it must give some preferences to that segment of the market,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Only when it is ''self-sufficient'' will the media ''reflect
real life, and not that which is wanted to be seen by people
ordering the information,'' Putin was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The international delegation said media intimidation took
several forms, citing the case of Radio Liberty journalist Andrei
Babitsky, who was detained by secret service agents in Chechnya in
January for not having proper accreditation, then disappeared for
weeks under mysterious circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   They also expressed concern about the criminal investigation
into media tycoon Vladimir Gusinsky, whose outlets have been
critical of the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Government prosecutors say they aren't trying to intimidate
Gusinsky. They said a raid by armed, masked tax police on his
Media-Most holding company was part of an inquiry into allegations
that he embezzled money during a privatization deal. Gusinsky was
later jailed for four days.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot excuse politically motivated prosecutions clearly
aimed at one of the free press, one of the very few independent
voices in Russia, and particularly the fashion in which it was
done,'' said James H. Ottaway Jr., chairman of the World Press
Freedom Committee and Senior Vice President of Dow Jones &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   In the Izvestia interview, Putin did not mention Gusinsky by
name, but said some businessmen ''are fighting more to save their
influence on the government than for the freedom of speech and
press.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Russian media are beholden to their owners' political
interests, and Gusinsky's NTV television openly backed President
Boris Yeltsin's re-election campaign in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Regional media, meanwhile, are often heavily controlled or
funded by local governments. Several Russian journalists have been
beaten or killed in recent years, in what human rights groups have
called attempts to stifle opposition voices.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation said it was particularly concerned about a
Russian media policy statement, submitted at a recent meeting of
European ministers, that called for preventing the ''use of
information with a view to undermining a state's political,
economic and social system.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the kind of language that we have not heard here in
Russia or abroad since the end of the Cold War, which we therefore
find extremely unsettling,'' said Ronald Koven, the European
representative of the World Press Freedom Committee.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Marriage Tax Cut  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House has again passed Republican
legislation to cut taxes for millions of married couples, setting
up a showdown in the Senate and a late July, pre-GOP convention
confrontation with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans, meanwhile, reached agreement with Democrats
to remove parliamentary roadblocks and finish debate this week on a
House-passed bill to abolish estate taxes, another GOP priority
that Clinton has threatened to veto.
</P>
<P>
   In the first vote on that measure Thursday, senators rejected,
53-46, a Democratic amendment that would sharply increase the
amount of an estate exempt from taxes -- it is now $675,000 per
individual, more for small businesses and family farms -- but would
stop short of complete abolition.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats planned to offer other amendments that would divert
some of the money in the GOP bill to such things as a college
tuition tax credit and a Medicare prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're saying there are other priorities,'' said Sen. Byron
Dorgan, D-N.D.
</P>
<P>
   The 269-159 vote by which the House passed the 10-year, $182
billion ''marriage penalty'' tax cut Wednesday was a virtual mirror
image of a February vote on the same bill. The move was necessary
because Senate Democrats filibustered the first bill, forcing GOP
leaders to pass it again under budget rules that limit debate and
amendments.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did it once, but it was held up in the Senate,'' said House
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. ''It's something we've promised the
American people, and we'll get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill is aimed at the estimated 25 million two-income married
couples who pay higher income taxes than they would if single, but
it also gives a tax cut to virtually all married people who file
joint tax returns. It would gradually expand the bottom 15 percent
income tax bracket so that by 2007 it is double the bracket for two
single people and would boost the standard deduction to twice that
of singles in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also would raise the income cap to allow more
lower-income couples to claim the earned income tax credit and
would ensure that couples who claim certain personal credits, such
as the $500 per-child credit, do not run afoul of the complex
alternative minimum tax.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate intends to take up its 10-year, $248 billion version
of the bill later this week. A House-Senate conference committee
would be named to work out differences, which mainly center on how
the next-highest 28 percent tax bracket is treated.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are rushing to get the bill to Clinton before the
start of the Republican National Convention on July 31, calculating
that a veto gives them a popular issue to exploit. If the president
were to sign the measure, the GOP could use that to fight Vice
President Al Gore's claim that Republicans are running a
''do-nothing'' Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats charged that the measure was nothing but ''a political
statement,'' in the words of Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. They tried
to force Republicans to attach a government-run Medicare
prescription drug benefit that Clinton has made a condition of
signing the tax cut into law. But that effort was rejected by a
230-197 vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think there's a nexus between marriage penalty and
prescription drugs,'' Hastert said. ''They're at risk of being
do-nothing Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Before taking up the marriage tax cut, the Senate intends to
begin serious debate on the 10-year, $104 billion Republican bill
that would gradually scrap federal estate taxes by 2010. Passage
could come as early as Thursday evening, or possibly Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats plan to offer a series of amendments, including a
Medicare prescription drug benefit, along with an estate tax
alternative that increases exemptions for family farms and small
businesses that suffer most from the tax. Clinton has endorsed the
Democratic approach, saying complete repeal is unnecessary and
would mainly help the wealthiest people in America.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's staggering to see what the Republicans will do in the
name of tax reduction, benefiting the very, very wealthiest in this
country,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Report: AIDS To Orphan 28 Million  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) -- An entirely new class of AIDS drugs
on the horizon may offer just-in-time help to many patients whose
treatment options are running out, researchers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The latest data suggest these drugs may dramatically restore
health -- at least temporarily -- to people dying because the virus
has grown resistant to all the currently available AIDS medicines.
</P>
<P>
   The new drugs block HIV in a different way from the standard
medicines that have revolutionized AIDS treatment in recent years.
Instead of gumming up the virus's ability to manufacture new copies
of itself, they block the virus from getting inside blood cells.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs are called entry inhibitors and are being developed by
many companies, although only one has entered broad human testing.
</P>
<P>
   ''They hold significant promise for the treatment of HIV,'' said
Dr. Joseph Eron of the University of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors discussed the drugs at the 13th International AIDS
Conference, where the latest data were presented on Trimeris,
Inc.'s experimental T-20, the most advanced medicine in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Combinations of drugs introduced about five years ago turned
AIDS from a death sentence to a treatable disease, at least in
parts of the world where people can afford the medicines. These
combinations can drive the virus below detectable levels, but in
about half of patients, the virus returns within a year.
</P>
<P>
   When this happens, doctors switch their patients to different
combinations of the 14 available drugs. However, the virus usually
returns even more quickly with each new drug cocktail.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these people remain outwardly well, despite their virus
levels. But no one knows how long this will last, and doctors worry
they will be left with nothing to fight the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''We desperately need new targets for tackling HIV,'' said Dr.
Julio Montaner of the University of British Columbia. ''We think
these people will need help in the not too distant future.''
</P>
<P>
   The current drugs fit into three major classes. But all work by
blocking the virus's ability to make new copies of itself once it
infects a cell. The new drugs instead are designed to stop the
virus from penetrating cells to start this process.
</P>
<P>
   When the new drugs are used alone, the virus appears to quickly
grow resistant to them, just as it does with other medicines. So
doctors envision combining these so-called entry inhibitors with
the standard medicines to keep a step ahead of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   ''Drugs that work on the outside of the cell would be a
tremendous addition to the drugs that work on the inside,'' said
Dr. David Ho of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Cal Cohen of the Community Research Initiative of New
England presented data on 71 patients who took T-20 after failing
with all the standard drugs. Fourteen did not get better, and 16
others dropped out of the study for a variety of personal reasons.
But after one year, 41 are still in the study and responding well
to the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Their average virus levels were 100,000 copies per milliliter of
blood before treatment and 3,000 copies now.
</P>
<P>
   Among the patients was a dying man, blind in one eye from an
AIDS-related infection, whose HIV-ravaged white blood cells had
dropped to a precipitous 33 copies per cubic millimeter of blood.
After a year on T-20 and four standard AIDS drugs, his blood cells
have risen to 430 copies, and his virus level is barely detectable.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now he is even healthier looking than I am,'' Cohen said.
''He's back to life. You control the virus, and good things
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The drug's major drawback is that it must be injected twice a
day, but Cohen said patients seemed able to do this without
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Fusion inhibitors, plus new versions of standard drugs, ''may be
exactly what people need,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Trimeris is designing large, final-stage testing of T-20.
Officials say this will involve people at earlier stages of
infection.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, scientists have worked out the mechanics of the
devilishly sophisticated process by which the virus gets into its
targets. T-20 works by blocking one step in the fusion of the virus
to cells, and other drugs interrupt at other points.
</P>
<P>
   Another of these entry-blocking drugs, developed by Schering
Plough, begins first-stage human testing this month in the United
States.

<HEADLINE> House Votes To Restore Debt Relief  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rejecting cuts by Republican leaders, the
House voted Thursday to give President Clinton most of the money he
wants for debt relief for the world's poorest nations.
</P>
<P>
   The 216-211 vote on an amendment by Rep. Maxine Waters.,
D-Calif., reversed a voice vote late Wednesday that would have cut
Clinton's request for $262 million by two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   Waters' measure takes money from foreign military aid and
training and devotes it to debt relief, which would now get a total
of $237 million next year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without American leadership, debt relief will never become a
reality,'' she said. ''... Most of the debts owed by poor countries
were accumulated during the Cold War, and many are the result of
loans to corrupt dictators who are no longer in power.''
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 221-206 earlier Thursday to ban the use of U.S.
funds overseas by private organizations that perform abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why we should we use taxpayers' money ... to fund
international family planning lobbyists?'' said Rep. Walter B.
Jones, R-N.C.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt said the restriction
on family planning funds is ''one of many glaring flaws'' in a bill
that would devote $13.3 billion in the next fiscal year to foreign
aid. The House was expected to complete the bill late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also voted 267-156 Thursday to restore $42 million
that the House Appropriations Committee had cut from Clinton's
request of $244 for combating the AIDS epidemic in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Gene Sperling, head of
the president's National Economic Council, told reporters Wednesday
that cutting Clinton's request for debt relief would prevent the
United States from meeting its obligations under a program launched
last year by the world's richest industrial countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president's advisers will recommend that the president
veto the bill,'' Summers said then.
</P>
<P>
   The votes Thursday may spare Clinton some embarrassment when he
attends this year's annual economic summit next week in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   At last year's summit, the world's seven richest countries -- the
United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada --
pledged to write off $50 billion in debt owed by poor nations.
</P>
<P>
   The debt issue has been pushed by a collection of religious
organizations operating under the banner, Jubilee 2000. In a
ceremony outside the Capitol, the group presented the members of
Congress with boxes full of petitions it said had been signed by
500,000 Americans urging debt forgiveness for poor nations.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 4811

<HEADLINE> Britain Debates Silly Pub Names  </HEADLINE>
By JILL LAWLESS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The Goat and Compasses is fine, but the Goose and
Granite is definitely not.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over British pub names is foaming up again: The Goat
and Compasses is a centuries-old moniker, while the latter is a
newly minted corporate label.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional English pub names often are patriotic or royal -- The
Crown, The King's Head, The Red Lion. Others are resolutely local,
paying tribute to the lord of the manor or reflecting a region's
landmarks, flora and fauna, industry or sporting heroes.
</P>
<P>
   But today's British beer drinkers are increasingly likely to
head down to the Rat and Parrot chain or the Slug and Lettuce. And
some feel it has all gone a Dog and Doughnut too far.
</P>
<P>
   In the House of Commons this week, Britain's culture minister,
Chris Smith, lamented ''a growing fashion for rebranding pubs with
names like the Dog and Doughnut or the Goose and Granite which, I
have to say, would appear to have little relevance to the history
of any area.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are surely in danger here of losing an important part of
local history and local folk memory,'' he told lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Many British pub names do have deep and sometimes mysterious
historical roots, originating in preliterate days when ale houses
had to sport large, memorable and easily identifiable signs.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Rose, secretary of the Inn Sign Society, cites his local
pub, the Bull and Spectacles -- a reference to a former landlord's
prize bull or to Anne Boleyn (Bull-inn), depending on which legend
you believe.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of individuality, pub aficionados argue, is now in
danger.
</P>
<P>
   A third of Britain's 60,000 pubs are controlled by breweries
that dictate what beer is sold there. Another third are now owned
by non-brewing chains -- and it is these standardized corporate
''theme'' pubs that traditionalists object to most.
</P>
<P>
   Some call it the ''McDonald's-ization'' of British pubs.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can go into a Rat and Parrot in the southeast or the
northwest and they're exactly the same,'' said Ian Woolverton of
the consumer group Campaign for Real Ale. ''That can't be good for
our pub heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not the name changes in themselves that vex campaigners.
Pubs have long rechristened themselves to commemorate historic
events: The Royal Oak, a name borne by more than 600 British pubs,
emerged in the 17th century to mark King Charles II's escape from
Oliver Cromwell's forces.
</P>
<P>
   ''Almost every pub has had a name change,'' said Rose of the Inn
Sign Society. ''If they didn't, we wouldn't have a hobby, would
we?''
</P>
<P>
   Rose noted that changing social mores -- from the demise of
cockfighting to the present-day proposed ban on fox hunting -- could
drive pubs to rename themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got pubs called the Fox and Hounds. Will that change
when the anti-hunting law comes in? What we don't like is that
we're losing the historic ones,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The chain-pub operators counter that they are pumping new life
into a flagging industry, renovating once-dingy boozers and
attracting young people to big, bright watering holes. Many
traditional rural pubs, meanwhile, are closing as their aging
clientele drinks less.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our bars are big and they're busy, so we're giving people what
they want,'' said Clive Eplett, finance director of SFI Group PLC,
which owns the Litten Tree and Bar Med chains and is in the process
of acquiring the 33-bar Slug and Lettuce group -- a pioneer of the
up-market stripped-wood-and-focaccia formula.
</P>
<P>
   He said most of SFI's pubs are former shops and banks, rather
than existing pubs. And he is not nostalgic for the pubs of
yesteryear, arguing that chains like his, selling beer from several
breweries, offer customers more choice.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was born in a small village in Cornwall, and all the pubs
were owned by one brewery,'' he said. ''You drank their beer or you
didn't drink at all.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is arguing the government should legislate pub names. But
campaigners want to see names included as part of a pub's license,
so change would require planning permission and local consultation.
</P>
<P>
   That argument sits well with Smith, the government minister.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly, consulting a pub's regulars and the wider local
community before renaming it would not seem too much to ask,'' he
told the Commons.

<HEADLINE> Russian Military Argies Over Nukes  </HEADLINE>
By ANNA DOLGOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- A proposed reform of Russia's nuclear forces has
exploded into a major conflict among the military's top brass,
causing what the Russian media described Thursday as an
unprecedented ''coup attempt'' against Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev.
</P>
<P>
   A former chief of Russia's Strategic Missile Forces, Sergeyev
insists Russia must develop its nuclear weapons to deter potential
aggressors, at a time when its conventional forces are in disarray.
</P>
<P>
   But as Russia's offensive against rebels in Chechnya drags on,
commanders of conventional forces are demanding more money for
tanks and artillery, and some suggest that nuclear weapons programs
are taking up too much of the military funding.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict blew up on Wednesday, when the military's top brass
gathered to discuss how to restructure the armed forces to preserve
their combat capability in the face of severe financial shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev was advocating his longtime plan to beef up Russia's
Strategic Missile Forces, making them the core of a new deterrent
force into which the nuclear capabilities of the Navy and the Air
Force would be incorporated.
</P>
<P>
   But Anatoly Kvashnin, the chief of the General Staff, came out
against Sergeyev, addressing the meeting with his own reform plan
that envisages significant cuts in the Strategic Missile Forces and
calls for incorporating them into the Air Force -- significantly
reducing their status.
</P>
<P>
   Kvashnin also proposed boosting the number of conventional units
that Russia can deploy in the turbulent southwest, where Chechnya
is located, and in Central Asia, where Russia is trying to fight a
growing drug trade from Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the first time in the history of the Russian army, the
General Staff chief openly went against the defense minister,'' the
daily Kommersant said Thursday. ''What happened ... can only be
described as a coup attempt in the military,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   The daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta called Kvashnin's expression of
dissent ''an unprecedented step.''
</P>
<P>
   Independent military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer said Thursday
that the military had hoped for increased funding when President
Vladimir Putin came to power earlier this year, but had seen its
hopes dashed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the start of a very serious ... crisis within the
armed forces, and between the armed forces and the government,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gen. Leonid Ivashov, chief of the Defense Ministry's
international cooperation department, played down the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ''When a reform of the armed forces is under way, there are
always a lot of discussions,'' Ivashov told reporters Thursday.
''It's a normal procedure.''

<HEADLINE> Improvement, Problems With U.S. Kids  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- By some measures, this is a golden age for
America's children: They are healthier, better fed, less likely to
live in poverty and more likely to survive to adulthood than ever
before.
</P>
<P>
   But a new government study also shows that U.S. kids drink too
much, smoke too often and more than a quarter of high school
seniors are using drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''In some areas, the health and well-being of American children
is better than it has ever been,'' said Dr. Duane Alexander of the
National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.
</P>
<P>
   But Alexander added: ''There are some things that are not the
way they should be, and even the indicators that are 'best-ever'
status have room for improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement about the report, U.S. Secretary of Education
Richard W. Riley said, ''Today is a good news day for America's
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Rising prosperity of the last eight years, said Riley, ''is
making a real difference for our nation's children.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that 59 percent of young children are now enrolled in
early education programs. Riley said that 55 percent of high
schoolers are now participating in volunteer activities, a 10
percent increase from 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The annual report was compiled by the Federal Interagency Forum
on Child and Family Statistics. It uses data from 20 federal
agencies on the health, education, economic and education trends
among America's 70.2 million children under the age of 18. The
report is based on the most recent statistics, with most of the
data from 1999, 1998 or 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights:
</P>
<P>
   --More children 19 months to 35 months old have received
vaccinations than ever before. For 1998, the rate was 79 percent, a
3 percentage point increase from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   --Infant mortality -- meaning death before the first birthday --
held steady from 1997 to 1998. The rate in both years was 7.2
deaths per 1,000 live births. Worldwide, the United States ranks
25th in infant mortality.
</P>
<P>
   --Older children and adolescents are now more likely to reach
adulthood, as mortality rates for them have improved in the past
three years.
</P>
<P>
   --Fewer teen-agers are giving birth, following a declining trend
first noted in 1991. There were 32 births per 1,000 females between
the ages 15 and 17 in 1997, while the latest data, from 1998, puts
the rate at 30.
</P>
<P>
   --Fewer children are living in below-poverty level homes than at
any time in the past 20 years. The percentage dropped from 19
percent in 1997 to 18 percent in 1998, a rate level last reached in
1980. The percentage of children living in poverty peaked at 22
percent in 1993 and has been declining since.
</P>
<P>
   --The percentage of low birth weight babies (under 5.5 pounds at
birth) continues to go up, increasing from 7.5 percent of newborns
in 1997 to 7.6 percent in 1998. One reason may be an increase in
multiple births caused by a more common use of fertility drugs and
medically assisted conception.
</P>
<P>
   --Children represent 26 percent of the U.S. population, compared
with 36 percent in 1964, the end of the post-World War II baby
boom.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander said health officials are concerned that the rate of
drinking, smoking and drug use among American youngsters remains
''stable at unacceptably high levels despite our efforts to reduce
these.''
</P>
<P>
   The report found that the rate of youthful cigarette smokers was
essentially unchanged from 1998 to 1999. The percentage of 12th
graders who reported smoking daily, for instance, increased by a
percentage point, to 23 percent, during that period.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol use was also essentially unchanged, with 31 percent of
12th graders reporting frequent drinking during 1999, and 32
percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Illicit drug use among 12th graders was 27 percent for both
years, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander said efforts to combat sudden infant death syndrome by
teaching parents and caregivers to put babies to sleep on their
backs instead of on their tummies has been a major factor in the
reduction of infant mortality.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have reduced SIDS by about 50 percent with this effort, but
we can achieve an even greater reduction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in low birth weight babies is a major contributor
to the infant mortality rate, said Alexander. Babies born
prematurely are more fragile and less apt to survive, although
Alexander noted that American medical workers now ''are able to
save more and more'' of such infants.
</P>
<P>
   Death rates among children ages 1 to 19 ''are the lowest they
have ever been,'' said Alexander. The biggest drop was among
adolescents, ages 15 to 19. In 1997, the death rate was 79 per
100,000. The latest figures, from 1998, put it at 75.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander said the drop in death rates among children can be
traced, in part, to an aggressive campaign to lower traffic
accident deaths, but car crashes are still a significant factor in
childhood mortality.
</P>
<P>
   ''We made major progress in reducing injuries with car seats and
seat belts,'' he said, ''but two-thirds of children killed in auto
accidents were not using seat belts or car seats.''

Secretary William Cohen on Thursday about Israel's cancellation of
a planned military aircraft sale to China, a deal the United States
opposed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It certainly was a concern to China that the sale was
canceled,'' Cohen told reporters after meeting with Zemin at
Zhongnanhai, the Communist Party leadership compound. Other U.S.
officials said later that although Zemin noted the loss, he did not
directly accuse the United States of sabotaging the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's proposed sale to China of an advanced airborne radar
system, called the Phalcon, was a particularly sensitive issue
because, in the U.S. view, it could have affected the military
balance between China and Taiwan. The plane would have given China
an improved capability to coordinate offensive air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese Foreign Ministry criticized the United States for
pressuring Israel to drop the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''No other country has the right to interfere in bilateral
cooperation that China has with other governments,'' spokesman Zhu
Bangzao told a news briefing at the Foreign Ministry. ''In our
view, agreements reached between China and other governments should
be followed.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on his second and final day of talks with
Chinese officials in Beijing, Cohen said U.S. opposition to the
Phalcon sale was not a sign of U.S. efforts to limit China's
military.
</P>
<P>
   ''It does not signal any attempt to contain China,'' Cohen said,
adding, ''I don't believe China can be contained.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech earlier Thursday at the National Defense University,
which provides military education to senior officers, Cohen focused
on the prospects for improved U.S.-China relations. He sought to
dispel the notion held by China's leaders that the United States is
trying to contain China in the same way it approached the former
Soviet Union in a cold war of military, economic and political
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Those in the United States who advocate a containment policy
toward China are pursuing ''folly and futility,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   He also accused China's government-controlled media of
presenting a distorted view of U.S. intentions, saying China
''sometimes presents the United States in a way that is not only
unhelpful but is untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The characterization of the United States being a hegemon, a
country determined to dominate the world and to contain and
dominate China, is simply untrue,'' he said. ''We see constant
references in the Chinese media'' to the United States that amount
to ''hyperbole or criticism or negativity.''
</P>
<P>
   China also views U.S. development of a national missile defense
as another means of dominating China -- a contention Cohen countered
by saying the system would ''not be designed to address China's
missile capability.''
</P>
<P>
   In a question-and-answer session following his speech, Cohen --
and perhaps many of the Chinese officers in the audience -- were
taken by surprise when a woman seated near Cohen's wife, Janet,
stood and posed a lengthy question that drew a vigorous and
seemingly spontaneous burst of applause.
</P>
<P>
   The woman was Victoria Chen, the wife of Maj. Gen. Zhan Maohai,
a foreign affairs specialist in the Ministry of National Defense.
She waved off a uniformed Chinese officer's mild attempt to silence
her, and noted Cohen's criticisms of China's media.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the same problem occurs in the U.S. media,'' she said
through an interpreter, singling out coverage of human rights in
China. Her comments seemed to catch Cohen off-guard.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess I should have cut the questions before you asked your
question,'' Cohen joked.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have abuses -- not abuses -- we have a free media in the
United States,'' Cohen said, adding, ''There are some in our media
that characterize or mischaracterize China.'' He said such
distortions ''too often have caused tensions between our two
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen later hosted a dinner at his hotel for Gen. Chi Haotian,
the minister of defense, and other senior Chinese military
officers.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Cohen was flying to Shanghai to deliver a speech on
U.S.-China trade relations at the Shanghai Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> AIDS May Orphan 28 Million in Africa  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) -- Nearly 28 million African children
are expected to lose at least one parent to AIDS by 2010, leaving a
continent plagued by a generation of devastated youth, according to
a report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The potential for social ... instability is pretty
significant,'' said John Williamson, co-author of the report by the
U.S. Agency for International Development, released at the 13th
International AIDS Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have a very substantial proportion of your population that
has been undereducated, malnourished, marginalized, is disaffected,
not able to go to school.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently there are nearly 16 million children under the age of
15 who have lost at least one parent to the disease. About 90
percent of these orphans are in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   That number will swell to 30 million by 2010, with 28 million of
them in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the report, ''Children on
the Brink 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   That estimate does not include the mass of children born with
the virus that causes AIDS, since most of them will likely die
before they reach age 5.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the millions of children already orphaned have no one to
care for them and are often simply abandoned to the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are children out there who go without a meal a day. They
actually go without schooling,'' said Grace Mguni, who oversees
projects for orphans in townships outside of Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
   Even before their parents die, many of these children are forced
to leave school to care for their ailing parents or to support the
family.
</P>
<P>
   ''AIDS is changing the social landscape in the most affected
countries,'' Williamson said. ''It's creating an unprecedented set
of child welfare problems.''
</P>
<P>
   As important as the loss of education and economic security is
the loss of a loving environment, said Tony Barnett, a professor at
the University of East Anglia in Great Britain who has studied the
social and economic impact of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a cost and we don't know how to measure it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths of so many parents will also ''rupture the
intergenerational bargain,'' forcing elderly Africans who were
traditionally supported by their children to return to work to
support not only themselves but their grandchildren, Barnett said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the USAID report, about one in three children in
Namibia, Swaziland, Zimbabwe and South Africa will have lost a
parent by 2010, most of them to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ''The HIV pandemic is producing orphans on a scale unrivaled in
history,'' said Susan Hunter, the other report author.
</P>
<P>
   While famine, wars and other disease outbreaks leave large
numbers of orphans, those are short-term calamities that quickly
end, Hunter said. AIDS will continue to create millions of new
orphans for decades.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to deal with the crisis is not to put the children
in expensive, but often substandard, orphanages, Williamson said,
but to support their extended families and communities to help them
cope.
</P>
<P>
   Governments also need to protect the inheritance rights of
widows and orphans, he said. Those rights are often ignored in many
African communities, and a deceased man's property may end up going
to his brother instead of his wife and children.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of the orphan problem has been clear for years, but
only recently have people begun to act, Barnett said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tragedy of all this is that it's taken so long,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> New AIDS Drugs on the Horizon  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) -- An entirely new class of AIDS drugs
on the horizon may offer just-in-time help to many patients whose
treatment options are running out, researchers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The latest data suggest these drugs may dramatically restore
health -- at least temporarily -- to people dying because the virus
has grown resistant to all the currently available AIDS medicines.
</P>
<P>
   The new drugs block HIV in a different way from the standard
medicines that have revolutionized AIDS treatment in recent years.
Instead of gumming up the virus's ability to manufacture new copies
of itself, they block the virus from getting inside blood cells.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs are called entry inhibitors and are being developed by
many companies, although only one has entered broad human testing.
</P>
<P>
   ''They hold significant promise for the treatment of HIV,'' said
Dr. Joseph Eron of the University of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors discussed the drugs at the 13th International AIDS
Conference, where the latest data were presented on Trimeris,
Inc.'s experimental T-20, the most advanced medicine in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Combinations of drugs introduced about five years ago turned
AIDS from a death sentence to a treatable disease, at least in
parts of the world where people can afford the medicines. These
combinations can drive the virus below detectable levels, but in
about half of patients, the virus returns within a year.
</P>
<P>
   When this happens, doctors switch their patients to different
combinations of the 14 available drugs. However, the virus usually
returns even more quickly with each new drug cocktail.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these people remain outwardly well, despite their virus
levels. But no one knows how long this will last, and doctors worry
they will be left with nothing to fight the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''We desperately need new targets for tackling HIV,'' said Dr.
Julio Montaner of the University of British Columbia. ''We think
these people will need help in the not too distant future.''
</P>
<P>
   The current drugs fit into three major classes. But all work by
blocking the virus's ability to make new copies of itself once it
infects a cell. The new drugs instead are designed to stop the
virus from penetrating cells to start this process.
</P>
<P>
   When the new drugs are used alone, the virus appears to quickly
grow resistant to them, just as it does with other medicines. So
doctors envision combining these so-called entry inhibitors with
the standard medicines to keep a step ahead of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   ''Drugs that work on the outside of the cell would be a
tremendous addition to the drugs that work on the inside,'' said
Dr. David Ho of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Cal Cohen of the Community Research Initiative of New
England presented data on 71 patients who took T-20 after failing
with all the standard drugs. Fourteen did not get better, and 16
others dropped out of the study for a variety of personal reasons.
But after one year, 41 are still in the study and responding well
to the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Their average virus levels were 100,000 copies per milliliter of
blood before treatment and 3,000 copies now.
</P>
<P>
   Among the patients was a dying man, blind in one eye from an
AIDS-related infection, whose HIV-ravaged white blood cells had
dropped to a precipitous 33 copies per cubic millimeter of blood.
After a year on T-20 and four standard AIDS drugs, his blood cells
have risen to 430 copies, and his virus level is barely detectable.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now he is even healthier looking than I am,'' Cohen said.
''He's back to life. You control the virus, and good things
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The drug's major drawback is that it must be injected twice a
day, but Cohen said patients seemed able to do this without
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Fusion inhibitors, plus new versions of standard drugs, ''may be
exactly what people need,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Trimeris is designing large, final-stage testing of T-20.
Officials say this will involve people at earlier stages of
infection.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, scientists have worked out the mechanics of the
devilishly sophisticated process by which the virus gets into its
targets. T-20 works by blocking one step in the fusion of the virus
to cells, and other drugs interrupt at other points.
</P>
<P>
   Another of these entry-blocking drugs, developed by Schering
Plough, begins first-stage human testing this month in the United
States.

<HEADLINE> American Indian Youth Crime Rises  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rising rates of crime among young American
Indians are driven by a depressing combination of drinking and
despair, a government advisory panel said in a report released
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Coalition for Juvenile Justice said 3 percent of juveniles
arrested for liquor law violations are Indians, who account for
just 1 percent of U.S. boys and girls age 10 to 17. The coalition,
a nonprofit group of state advisory boards created under a federal
juvenile justice law, recommends expanding programs to fight Indian
alcoholism, depression and gangs.
</P>
<P>
   ''In states with significant American Indian communities,
American Indian youth are found far too frequently in the back of
squad cars, rather than in the front of classrooms,'' the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   As crime rates fall nationwide, they are rising in American
Indian communities, especially among the 43 percent of Indians
under age 20. The youth crime problem is just one of the social
problems facing urban and reservation Indian communities, the
report said. High reservation unemployment is one factor.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are limited opportunities on the reservation, especially
those in rural areas,'' said Kevin Shendoe, a member of New
Mexico's Jemez Pueblo who started a group to help youths develop
leadership skills. ''Given that and the history of alcoholism and
poverty, I think it all plays into students getting depressed and
frustrated -- and in certain serious cases, violent.''
</P>
<P>
   As chief judge for Colorado's Southern Ute Tribe, Elaine Newton
sees youngsters as young as 11 charged with underage drinking,
marijuana use or fighting.
</P>
<P>
   They are children without a childhood, Newton said. Many are
victims of abuse or what Newton calls ''emotional incest.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That's where children basically are left to feel responsible
for their parents' own emotional needs,'' Newton said. ''They feel
it's their fault that mom is drinking or dad leaves, when it's
really not their fault. I think we forget they are children.''
</P>
<P>
   The abuse is often passed down from generation to generation,
starting in the late 1800s when Indian children were forced into
boarding schools where tribal culture was suppressed and abuse and
neglect were commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   ''In society today, you're in between two cultures. They lost
their Indian culture and they're struggling with trying to figure
out where they fit,'' Newton said.
</P>
<P>
   Indians have some of the worst health care and highest death
rates from alcoholism, diabetes, accidents and suicide in the
nation. That means many young Indians are repeatedly traumatized by
deaths of friends and relatives, said Sandi Ernst, a psychologist
who ran the White Mountain Apache Tribe's child mental health
programs from 1993 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   A large number of children affected by alcohol in their mothers'
wombs also contributes to the crime problem, said Ernst, who now
practices in Phoenix. People exposed to alcohol in the womb are
more impulsive and often cannot understand consequences of their
behavior, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That increases the likelihood they're going to do stupid
things,'' Ernst said.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal programs, which must rely on federal funds, are too often
shortchanged, the report said. Newton said getting enough money to
help the children she sentences is a constant problem. Children who
have enough Indian heritage to qualify for some federal programs
but are not enrolled members of the tribe often fall through the
cracks, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Newton also thinks that Indian communities must take
responsibility for ending the cycle of abuse and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of us are in denial about what has happened,'' Newton
said. ''We cover up things or say nothing's wrong in our families.
We don't make our families accountable for the wrongs we may have
done.
</P>
<P>
   ''My sense is we need to validate what has happened, grieve and
then move on. Until you can do that, you just don't resolve
anything.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   VALLEY COTTAGE, N.Y. (AP) -- Rosie O'Donnell is moving back to
Rockland County.
</P>
<P>
   The talk show host, comedian and actress is buying a hilltop
home in Valley Cottage, not far from the Nyack house she left in
December, publicist Lois Smith said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''She never wanted to leave Rockland in the first place,'' Smith
said. ''She's thrilled to be coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell and her three children moved away because of fears
that her Nyack house, once owned by Helen Hayes, was too close to a
main street to offer enough privacy and security.
</P>
<P>
   She moved to Greenwich, Conn., and caused an uproar there when a
bodyguard hired to protect her oldest son applied for a
concealed-weapon permit. O'Donnell advocates gun control, and
National Rifle Association officials and others accused her of
hypocrisy.

<HEADLINE> German Teens Sentenced for Arson  </HEADLINE>
By JOCHEN WIESIGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   GERA, Germany (AP) -- Two teen-agers who threw Molotov cocktails
at a synagogue in eastern Germany on Hitler's birthday were
convicted Thursday and sentenced to prison, a verdict meant to show
that Germany takes combating far-right violence seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Andreas John, 18, drew a three-year term and Carsten Haag, 17,
received two years and three months for an attack that provoked
outrage across Germany.
</P>
<P>
   They had confessed to throwing beer bottles filled with oil at
the building in Erfurt, capital of Thuringia state, on the night of
April 20, saying they wanted to show ''Nazism is still alive.'' At
the start of the trial on Tuesday, both had expressed regret and
told the court they were no longer neo-Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Their lawyers had sought lenient sentences, citing the change of
views. Federal prosecutors had asked for 3&AMP;frac12; years.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum possible sentence under juvenile law in Germany is
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   A third defendant, David Koehler, 18, who was charged with being
an accessory to the crime, was given probation. He had admitted
driving the other two to Erfurt, but said he was unaware of what
they were planning to do.
</P>
<P>
   Although there was little damage because the Molotov cocktails
failed to ignite, the attack prompted a nationwide outcry against
neo-Nazi violence and expressions of solidarity with Germany's
small Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   ''What are Jews to think after all their painful experiences
when 17- and 18-year-olds try to set a synagogue on fire in today's
Germany?'' said presiding judge Erich Rachor, adding that one of
the defendants had displayed ''unbearable hate toward Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   The verdict sent a signal that neo-Nazi ideas ''have no place in
our society and must be fought with full force,'' said Joerg van
Essen, a lawmaker for the opposition Free Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors had taken over the Erfurt case as part of a
drive begun this year to send a signal of deterrence through swift
convictions and sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   But even a leader of Germany's ruling coalition insisted the
government must do more to combat racism and anti-Semitism among
young Germans. Attacks -- from vandalism at Jewish graves to
beatings of foreigners by neo-Nazi skinheads -- are a near daily
occurrence in Germany, home to 2 million Turks and about 5 million
other foreign nationals.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Cabinet agreed Wednesday to get
government ministries working on how best to combat extremism, a
sign of concern especially about former communist East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In some eastern towns, young neo-Nazis hold sway over
schoolyards and streets to such a degree that foreigners or German
youths who don't share their views risk a beating or simply avoid
those parts of town.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Greens party, Schroeder's junior coalition
partner, said she wants the federal government to pump money into
anti-extremist education in schools and counseling for neo-Nazi
victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are noticing that these extreme-right views turn up at the
kitchen table and are supported by the families,'' Greens
chairwoman Renate Kuenast said on German radio. ''That makes it
even more important for political leaders to intervene.''

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Penguin Celebrities Go Home  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- They are black and white, about
18 inches tall, go by the names of Peter, Percy and Pamela, and are
Cape Town's hottest new celebrities -- the stars of the great
penguin swimming marathon.
</P>
<P>
   The three African penguins make their homes on islands off South
Africa's west coast, but their lives and those of tens of thousands
of their waddling cohorts were threatened by an oil spill last
month off Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
   To save the birds, environmental workers and volunteers took
about 20,000 of them off of the islands, trucked them eight hours
up the coast and released them to swim home, which they can do by
instinct. Authorities hope workers have enough time to clean up the
oil spill before the penguins make it back.
</P>
<P>
   What gives Peter, Percy and Pamela their star status is the
satellite tracking devices attached to their backs.
</P>
<P>
   The monitors allow the University of Cape Town avian demography
unit to monitor their movements, and their swim is featured daily
on radio stations and in local newspapers. An Internet site that
tracks their progress has had more than 41,000 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Peter, who was released June 30, had passed the southern tip of
Africa by Thursday morning. He had been swimming at an average
speed of 1.6 miles an hour since Wednesday, the avian demography
unit said. At that rate, he will reach home on Monday or Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Percy, who was released July 5, was halfway home by Thursday.
Pamela was some 40 miles behind him, despite having been released
two days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   There were tense moments earlier this week when the tracking
devices failed to register readings, raising fears the birds had
fallen prey to sharks. But by Wednesday, they were back on line.
Marine official Rob Crawford said the transmitters only stay on 12
hours at a time to save batteries, and they must have been off when
the satellite passed over the birds.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Cape Town's professor Les Underhill said
numerous other birds also had been tagged so their movements can be
tracked. It was thought the journey would take about 11 days, but
the penguins have been swimming slower than expected.
</P>
<P>
   The penguins that were released to swim home were unscathed by
the oil spill. But about 23,000 other penguins were coated in oil.
</P>
<P>
   Those birds, which need to be hand-fed for up to two months
before their coats again become waterproof so that they can swim in
the sea, are being cared for at rehabilitation centers in Cape
Town. Less than 1 percent of the captured birds have died.
</P>
<P>
   The spill was caused by the Panamanian tanker Treasure, which
sank June 23, causing the country's worst environmental disaster.
It was carrying 1,300 tons of heavy bunker oil, but authorities are
unsure how much leaked.

<HEADLINE> Hearst To Give Tour of Castle Estate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Media heiress Patricia Hearst will appear in
two specials giving a personal tour of the Hearst Castle estate in
San Simeon.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst, the granddaughter of the late media mogul William
Randolph Hearst, will do the specials for the Travel Channel cable
network to air in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst Castle was built between 1922 and 1947 and was made a
California State Historical Monument in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   The first episode will feature Hearst discussing the background
of the residence as well as giving a personal tour of parts of the
estate closed to the public. The second episode will focus on
William Randolph Hearst's relationship with celebrities such as
Charlie Chaplin and Clark Gable and some of the parties at the
residence.
</P>
<P>
   Patty Hearst was kidnapped by members of the Symbionese
Liberation Army in 1974. She eventually joined the group and was
captured and convicted of bank robbery. She was sentenced to seven
years in prison, but then-President Carter commuted the sentence
after 21 months.

   TOPSAIL BEACH, N.C. (AP) -- ''Dawson's Creek'' producers can
shoot scenes on the beach as long as they don't trample the nests
where endangered sea turtles lay their eggs.
</P>
<P>
   The town council cleared the way for the teen-targeted TV show
Wednesday night after producers agreed to undergo sensitivity
coaching.
</P>
<P>
   Producers also will donate money to the Karen Beasley Turtle
Rescue and Rehabilitation Center, said Andy Lanier, a
representative of the show's producers.
</P>
<P>
   Scenes taped at the beach later this month will be incorporated
into the show's fourth season premiere, said show spokesman Doug
Nicely. ''Dawson's Creek'' is largely shot on location in
Wilmington, about 20 miles south.

<HEADLINE> Conger: Fox TV Appearance a Mistake  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Darva Conger took her Playboy promotional tour
to San Diego, the hometown of her ex-husband from ''Who Wants to
Marry a Multimillionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   The 34-year-old Santa Monica woman said she considers her
February appearance on Fox's program a huge mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you make a mistake of that magnitude, you can't do
anything but say, 'I made a mistake,' learn from it and move on,''
Conger said Wednesday. ''I just wanted to be on TV for 10 minutes.
I never expected all of this would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Conger said she is comfortable with her Playboy pictorial, but
added that she wouldn't have considered posing in the magazine had
she not been fired from her job as an emergency room nurse after
the TV show.
</P>
<P>
   ''They made the offer when I had no other options open to me,''
she said. Conger would not reveal what she was paid by Playboy.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Rockwell, Conger's ex-husband, lives in Encinitas, north of
San Diego. Rockwell, 42, previously called for a nationwide boycott
of Playboy during a television interview.

<P>
   UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. (AP) -- The screenwriters of ''The
Insider'' and ''Love and Basketball'' have been honored with the
Humanitas Prize, which recognizes movies and television shows that
enrich the human spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tuesdays with Morrie,'' the TV movie based on the nonfiction
book about a dying professor and his former student, also was
recognized at Wednesday's ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The Human Family Educational and Cultural Institute founded the
cash awards in 1974 that now range from $10,000 to $25,000 and are
funded by an entertainment-industry supported endowment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not all of American entertainment is superficial and
dishonest,'' said the Rev. Ellwood Kieser, institute president.
</P>
<P>
   ''These shows tackle the big questions -- the ones that keep us
awake in the middle of the night -- and they challenge us to seek
out our own answers,'' Kieser said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Insider,'' based on the true story of tobacco industry
whistle-blower Jeffrey Wigand, was the winner in the feature film
category. Eric Roth and Michael Mann were the writers.
</P>
<P>
   Gina Prince-Bythewood's ''Love and Basketball,'' about two
aspiring athletes, was the winner of a new independent feature

'Tabletop' Play Proves Fascinating   
An AP Entertainment Review
By MARY CAMPBELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ''Tabletop,'' a play about making TV
commercials, sounds dim and proves fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Ackerman, who wrote it, directs plays in Chicago and has for
several years been property master for commercials, films and
''Saturday Night Live.'' His expertise, director Connie Grappo's
skill and some on-target acting performances make the play fairly
jump from the stage at the off-Broadway Working Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tabletop'' opened Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The two key performances are perfectly realized. Stand-up
comedian Rob Bartlett, host of radio and TV's ''Imus in the
Morning'' plays Marcus, who specializes in making TV commercials
shot on tabletops. He is a tyrant who believes in fear and tension
and mercilessly berates his crew. There's nothing funny about
Marcus. The only reason his crew doesn't hate him is that they
recognize and respect his love for commercials and his driving need
to make them.
</P>
<P>
   Opposite Bartlett is Jeremy Webb in a perfectly nuanced
performance as Ron, a kind of office boy who sprays the fruit
before TV shots.
</P>
<P>
   Ron is an idealist who thinks commercials are a boon to mankind
and should be made artistically. He's also an innovator who knows
how to make a liquid look thicker, or wire a bunch of grapes
upright so the wiring doesn't show.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Nolen, like Webb is a veteran of regional theater, plays
Jeffrey, the props man. Bossy, sharp-tongued Andrea is played by
Elizabeth Hanley Rice, who has acted on- and off-Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Egos flare, ambitions bloom and wilt. Cameraman Oscar (Harvey
Blanks) dreams of opening a hardware store in New Jersey. Dave the
lighting man (Dave Koenig) is a homosexual struggling to stay in
the closet. Their lives, intersecting with the TV commercial -- that
most ephemeral and ridiculed of modern phenomena -- make engrossing
drama.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Doctors End 4-Month Strike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli doctors ended a crippling 127-day
strike Thursday after reaching an agreement with the government
that will lead to higher wages and other benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The strike had shut down all but emergency services in the
country's public hospitals, and was blamed for several deaths
caused by canceled and delayed operations.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors had sought substantial raises in their monthly
salaries, which average $2,750. In the agreement signed with the
Finance Ministry, they settled for raises of anywhere from $675 to
$950 a month, depending on experience.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors also strengthened their pension plans and reached
new limits on consecutive work hours. They agreed to a strike
moratorium until 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak, in a statement issued from the United
States, where he is attending a peace summit, congratulated the
doctors on accepting the agreement. Barak had appointed two of his
top aides to broker the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Prime Minister is sorry for the suffering caused so many
patients by the extended strike, but praises the doctors for
behaving, after all, with great responsibility by stopping short of
an absolute strike,'' said the statement.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, some doctors had called for shutdowns of
emergency services, but most rejected that tactic.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could have received more if we were tougher, but of course
we couldn't be tougher,'' Pinchas Halperin, a doctor famed for his
emergency work after devastating earthquakes in Turkey last year,
told Channel Two television.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli doctors may supplement their income through private
practice, but private fees are beyond the means of most Israelis.
The strike was over salaries paid through the four national health
funds.

<HEADLINE> Some Harry Potter Pages Are Missing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- At least five copies of ''Harry Potter and
the Goblet of Fire'' purchased by the Salt Lake City Public Library
end in a cliffhanger -- the last 28 pages are missing.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're an avid fan, it's just disappointing,'' said Hikmet
Loe, technical services manager for the library.
</P>
<P>
   Lester Liebschutz, 69, discovered the flaw in his library copy
after peeking at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was cheating ... and it ended at half-sentence on Page
706,'' said the retired auto mechanics teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Kris Moran, director of publicity for the book's New York
publisher, Scholastic Inc., said Thursday that she hadn't gotten
any other calls reporting the glitch.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's isolated and it's not that unusual,'' she said. ''But
it's all in one place so it probably came in the same box.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, a shop in Allentown, Pa., found a dozen copies
of the book were missing pages 51 to 82, around Chapter 6. Some of
the faulty books also had duplicate pages.
</P>
<P>
   The book has sold nearly 3 million copies since it went on sale
Saturday morning, Moran said.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Leader Ready To Talk Peace  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAIRTUP, Russia (AP) -- Chechnya's self-declared separatist
president said he was prepared to negotiate a peace with Moscow,
but that rebels in his homeland would fight on indefinitely if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are trying to convince Russia that it is useless,'' to
continue the war, Aslan Maskhadov said in an interview with the
Azerbaijani News Service filmed at an undisclosed location in the
southern mountains of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview released Thursday, Maskhadov looked relaxed and
smiled on several occasions. He sat before a carpet hung on a wall
and sipped tea.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov, who has been in hiding for months, derided Russian
attempts to form a pro-Moscow administration in Chechnya as clumsy
and doomed, and called for peace talks under the auspices of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am ready to sit down at the negotiating table,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov has offered talks before, but Russia has rejected
negotiations with the rebels, offering only the possibility of
amnesty in exchange for the guerrillas' surrender. Meanwhile,
ambushes, mines and sniper attacks have taken a steady toll on
Russian forces despite their formal control of most of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov, who led separatist forces during their victorious
1994-96 war with Moscow, said new recruits were boosting rebel
ranks and that most Chechens despised Russian rule and would not
abide by the puppet government.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, said in an
interview published in Izvestia newspaper that ''patience'' will be
necessary in resolving the Chechen conflict, and that military
might alone won't bring peace to the region.
</P>
<P>
   ''Large-scale social rehabilitation (and) effective political
processes'' will also be required, he said, apparently referring to
work with the pro-Moscow administration.
</P>
<P>
   That administration convinced a 200-strong rebel band commanded
by warlord Turpal-ali Atgeriyev to lay down arms and surrender in
exchange for amnesty, Deputy Chief of the General Staff Col. Gen.
Valery Manilov said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Manilov said that ''the situation is under control, and no one
will allow the rebels to impose their terms on us,'' the Interfax
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Yet fighting continued.
</P>
<P>
   Two Russian police officers were wounded Wednesday when they
were fired on while patrolling a stretch of railroad track across
the Argun River near Grozny, military officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Two large mines were destroyed near the town of Kurchaloi, one
200 yards from a Russian checkpoint and another along a roadside
near the town, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said Thursday they had arrested a Chinese
citizen who had been training to become a terrorist in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Security Service said they detained Kurban Abdulaik,
a member of the Muslim Uighur ethnic group of western China, near
Chechnya and have extradited him to China, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
   In another development, Manilov said Moscow will stop announcing
casualty totals in the 11-month war. The military will release only
weekly totals of wounded and dead, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''About these tragic numbers ... my heart can't bear presenting
the total,'' he explained.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Declares $5M Diabetes Effort  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping for the ''true miracle'' of curing
diabetes, President Clinton on Thursday announced a $5 million
effort for clinical trials on a promising treatment for the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   During a speech before the NAACP, Clinton announced that the
National Institutes of Health and the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation
would release $5 million to 10 centers for research into a new
technique for transplanting cells in the pancreas, which produce
insulin.
</P>
<P>
   A team at the University of Alberta tested the procedure, called
islet transplantation, on seven patients with severe Type 1
diabetes, also known as juvenile diabetes. All of them have been
able to maintain normal blood sugar without taking insulin shots.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said more research is needed ''so we can prove it wasn't
an accident'' and hopefully speed up the day when a cure is found.
He told the NAACP the findings held especially great import for
minorities, who are more likely than whites to be afflicted with
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we can repeat these preliminary findings, it could put a
cure for juvenile diabetes within our reach, a true miracle,''
Clinton said. ''We're going to do everything we can about it, and I
hope we'll have some of your prayers and your support. It's worth
some of your money to spend on that.''
</P>
<P>
   The funds announced Thursday will go to centers in Boston;
Edmonton, Canada; Miami, Minneapolis, St. Louis, Seattle and
Bethesda, Md., as well as Geneva, Switzerland; Giessen, Germany and
Milan, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The trials, on 40 patients aged 18-65 who are unable to control
their blood sugars even with strict adherence to insulin
treatments, are scheduled to begin this fall. They will receive
islet transplants over the next 18 months. Children are ineligible
for the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Some 1 million Americans have Type 1 diabetes, and approximately
25 percent of them are minorities. The White House said 30,000 new
cases are diagnosed each year, 13,000 of them among children.
Overall, some 16 million people are diabetic, and one in four black
women over age 55 have the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The immune systems of Type 1 diabetes sufferers destroy
pancreatic cells that secrete insulin, which is needed to convert
sugar into energy. They must get regular insulin shots to survive;
Without the shots, they could go blind or develop life-threatening
complications, such as kidney failure.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also highlighted his recent request for $300 million
over five years for diabetes treatment and prevention. ''We would
like to see our children lifted from the burden and the fear, and
the terrors and the agony, that can come with juvenile diabetes,''
Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urged To Defer Missile Rule  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senior Senate Democrats urged the president
Thursday to put off a decision on proceeding with a national
anti-missile defense system, saying there are too few guarantees it
would be technically feasible and enhance national security.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't imagine that we would want to build something that
didn't work,'' Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle said at a news
conference where he was joined by the top Democrats on the Armed
Services and Foreign Relations committees, Sen. Carl Levin of
Michigan and Joseph Biden of Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   The issue arose less than a week after the second failure this
year of a Pentagon missile defense test and just minutes after the
Senate narrowly defeated a proposal requiring more thorough testing
before the defense system could be built.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted 52-48 to kill an amendment by Sen. Dick Durbin,
D-Ill., to a bill authorizing defense programs that would have
required the Pentagon to test the system's effectiveness against
countermeasures -- balloon decoys and other devices an adversary
might use to confuse an anti-missile rocket.
</P>
<P>
   All Democrats supported the amendment. All but three Republicans
-- Sens. Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine and Jim Jeffords
of Vermont -- opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton had been expected to make a decision later
this year on going ahead with a timetable that would have the
system ready for use by the end of 2005. The land-based system, a
much smaller version of the ''Star Wars'' space-based system
envisioned by President Reagan in the 1980s, would be designed to
stop a limited number of incoming missiles from hostile nations
such as North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton laid out four criteria for making a judgment: cost, the
extent of the threat, operational effectiveness and the impact on
national security.
</P>
<P>
   All four are in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters reject estimates the system would cost at least $60
billion while opponents say North Korea knows it would be suicidal
to attack the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The two test failures this year have brought the system's
feasibility into question, and the strong opposition of Russia,
China and some allies to a unilateral U.S. anti-missile system have
raised questions about its benefit to national security.
</P>
<P>
   ''This system is not ready for prime time. No president, this
one or the next, unless things change drastically, should in fact
deploy this system,'' Biden said.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Craig Quigley, a Pentagon spokesman, defended the
timetable. ''The goal of having a system, a limited system,
deployed by 2005 is responsive to the threat that we project to be
in existence at that time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen will make his recommendation
soon to Clinton, although it will not be a simple yes or no on
whether to go ahead, Quigley said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think Secretary Cohen has put any bounds on his
recommendations that he'll make to the president. If he thinks it's
relevant information that will help the president make that
decision, I'm certain he would not hesitate to provide it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP-led Congress has strongly supported the system and
generally shrugged off testing problems and warnings from Russia
and China that such a shield would violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., a strong advocate of the system,
said the Durbin amendment would cause unnecessary delays to ''a
very important capability to defend our nation against a serious
threat.'' He said the issue of countermeasures ''has been generated
by wild accusations from some college professors who have long
opposed missile defenses of any sort.''
</P>
<P>
   But Durbin said Republicans ducked the question of whether a $60
billion missile system can be misled by a cheap decoy. ''They are
afraid to admit that their multibillion-dollar theory may not
work.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote, said Daryl Kimball, director of the Coalition to
Reduce Nuclear Dangers, an arms-control advocacy group, ''shows
that the ideological drive for missile defense is so strong that
many senators are willing to move ahead even if the system does not
work.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   The Senate bill is S. 2549.

<HEADLINE> Observers Criticize Haiti Elections  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An international mission that monitored the
recent electoral process in Haiti said Thursday runoff elections on
July 9 were ''fundamentally flawed'' because they failed to include
races for 10 Senate seats.
</P>
<P>
   The allegation was contained in a preliminary report by the
Organization of American States Electoral Observer Mission to
Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   The May 21 elections, coupled with last Sunday's runoff, gave a
powerful boost to the Lavalas Party of former President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who is expected to win another term as
president in elections set for November.
</P>
<P>
   The mission's report, read to a special meeting of the OAS
permanent council by its chairman, Orlando Marville of Bardados,
said the 10 Senate races should have gone to a second round because
no candidate won an absolute majority on May 21.
</P>
<P>
   The mission registered its disapproval of the process by
dropping plans to monitor the second round two days before the
balloting was held.
</P>
<P>
   Marville noted that the president of Haiti's Provisional
Electoral Council resigned his post and left the country rather
than validate what he considered to be an electoral fix.
</P>
<P>
   He said the irregularity came to light in late May when the CEP
issued preliminary results in which ''the absolute majority was
based on a limited number of candidates instead of the total number
of valid votes.
</P>
<P>
   ''By these calculations, 17 senatorial races were decided in the
first round, of which 16 winners were from the Lavalas Party,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Haitian Foreign Minister Fritz Longchamps, who flew here from
Haiti for the meeting on short notice, said the electoral mission
was meddling in Haitian internal affairs
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know how an outside body can impose certain things on
a government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the substance of the mission's complaints, the minister
said it is difficult to apply the electoral law in senatorial
contests for more than one seat in an electoral district.
</P>
<P>
   The CEP, he said, ''sought in good faith a method that was
closest to the spirit of the law.'' He added that the Haitian
government does not defend one method of tallying over another.
</P>
<P>
   Both methods have flaws, he said, and the CEP felt it was better
for the country to decide on the one that was ''closest to the
reality'' of the popular vote.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department shares the electoral mission's view of the
situation. It said on Monday that the runoff was ''incomplete and
inappropriate'' because of the CEP's handling of the Senate races.

<HEADLINE> Teen Pregnancy on the Decline  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID PITT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Extending a trend that began in the early 1990s,
the teen-age pregnancy rate in the United States fell 8 percent
from 1995 to 1997, the government said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the teen
pregnancy rate -- the rate among girls 15 to 19 years old -- declined
from 98.3 pregnancies per 1,000 girls in 1995 to 90.7 per 1,000 in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the pregnancy rate for girls under 15 declined 11
percent, from 7.2 per 1,000 to 6.4 per 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Goodwin, spokeswoman for the National Center for Chronic
Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, said the declines are
probably due to increased use of condoms and long-acting hormonal
birth control methods introduced in the early 1990s. In adddition,
she said, studies indicate teen-age girls are becoming less
sexually active.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin said the teen pregnancy rate began increasing steadily
in 1986, peaking at its highest level on record in 1991, but has
declined every year since then. But she said that rates from the
1980s and the 1990s cannot be directly compared because they were
computed according to different methods.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the decline, the CDC said the United States still has
the highest adolescent pregnancy rate among developed countries,
with more than 800,000 girls 19 and younger becoming pregnant each
year.
</P>
<P>
   The government tracked live births, legal abortions, spontaneous
abortions and stillbirths.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC and other officials said the statistics probably
undercount teen-age pregnancies. Abortion rates are probably
underestimated, and a lot of early miscarriages probably go
unrecognized and unreported, Goodwin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''All those things lead us to believe, if anything, this is a
conservative estimate of teen pregnancy,'' Goodwin said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, North Dakota had the lowest pregnancy rate among 15- to
19-year-olds, at 48.2 per 1,000. Delaware had the highest, 127.8
per 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   From 1995 to 1997, 34 states had significant decreases in teen
pregnancy rates, ranging from 1.9 percent in Ohio to 19.8 percent
in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Community and school programs that bolster teen-agers'
self-esteem and encourage them to postpone sex and plan for the
future ''are all things that seem to have a positive effect,''
Goodwin said.

<HEADLINE> Bombay Mudslide Kills 58  </HEADLINE>
By V.K. NAIR
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOMBAY, India (AP) -- Rescue workers pulled out 58 bodies
Thursday after monsoon rains set off a landslide that buried the
crowded huts of a shantytown in India's largest city.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one-fourth of Bombay was under knee-deep water as rain
paralyzed life in the city for the second straight day. The
downpour eased late Thursday, but dark clouds threatened more
misery for the city's 15 million residents.
</P>
<P>
   With 50 people still feared buried by Wednesday evening's
landslide, the army moved in and stepped up relief work by
cordoning off the water-logged area.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will give any help needed to extricate the bodies and help
assist survivors,'' said army Maj. A.S. Negi.
</P>
<P>
   Press Trust of India news agency reported heavy rain continued
to lash Maharashtra state, of which Bombay is the capital, and
neighboring Gujarat state, raising the death toll in the past two
days to 85.
</P>
<P>
   Fire brigade officials said rescuers had difficulty reaching the
site of the landslide as water cut off major roads and crippled
Bombay's rail system.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-six survivors of the landslide were taken to hospitals
after they were freed from debris. Authorities at a nearby school
distributed food and water to 100 people left homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 300 people lived in the slum's makeshift tin and mud huts
on a hillside in eastern Bombay, most of them impoverished migrants
who came to the city in search of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers cleared debris with bulldozers and then used
their bare hands to dig through the mud.
</P>
<P>
   Irfan Mohammed, 29, a carpenter who lived in the shantytown,
took the blame for the deaths of his three sons.
</P>
<P>
   ''My wife and I forced our children to stay home. We thought
they would get sick playing in the rain. If we hadn't, they would
have escaped,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed survived because he stepped out to buy cigarettes.
''Everything came tumbling down,'' said Mohammed, whose wife and
mother also were feared trapped under the debris.
</P>
<P>
   Municipal authorities said they had warned the migrants to leave
the hill. But driven by poverty, the migrants set up unstable,
flimsy structures on the vacant land.
</P>
<P>
   ''We told people to vacate the slums, but no one listened,''
said Pravin Chira, a city council member.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors said no one heeded the warning when a few boulders
fell onto huts Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought this was the usual thing that happened every
monsoon. Then suddenly more boulders began to fall and I could hear
people crying for help,'' said Aslam Shaikh, a plumber.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rain on Wednesday and early Thursday forced the city to
shut down transport services and close schools and colleges. ''It
will take two to three days to clear this,'' said A.D. Jhandwal,
deputy chief fire officer.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Pipeline Survivors Sought  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK AIGBOGUN
<TEXT>
<P>
   OVIRI-COURT, Nigeria (AP) -- Nigerian officials pleaded Thursday
for survivors of an oil pipeline explosion to seek treatment, but
few emerged from hiding, apparently fearing arrest in the blast
that killed at least 100 people.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's explosion near the villages of Adeje and Oviri-Court
came after a vandalized pipeline caught fire. Pipeline sabotage is
common in Nigeria, and the penalty in the past has ranged from
prosecution to being shot on sight by police.
</P>
<P>
   Niger state Gov. James Ibori urged the estimated 100 injured
people to go to doctors, promising they would not be punished.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is no time for apportioning blame but a time to care,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the villages near the blast were practically empty Thursday,
as were area hospitals. Many of the injured -- including those with
serious burns -- were being treated by traditional doctors,
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Vincent Oziga, a physician at a village hospital in nearby
Mereje, said none of the injured turned up there.
</P>
<P>
   ''We learned of four victims who disappeared and two of them
apparently died,'' he said. ''One would not come to hospital even
after my nurses went to appeal to the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Villagers also whisked away many of the bodies, meaning a true
death toll may never be known. Witnesses have seen at least 100
corpses, and some local reporters have estimated as many as 250
killed.
</P>
<P>
   The accident took place in the oil-rich Niger Delta, where the
pipeline was carrying gasoline from a refinery to northern Nigeria.
While exactly what set off the blast remains unclear, state oil
officials blamed a fuel-smuggling ring for puncturing the pipeline
to siphon off gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Ibori said police were seeking leaders of the smuggling ring.
</P>
<P>
   Ndu Ughamadu, a state petroleum company spokesman, blamed an
organized smuggling network for the disaster. He said the local
crime ''barons'' intimidated local chiefs and sometimes used
violence against authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the victims -- mainly impoverished villagers, including
schoolchildren -- had been gathered close to the pipe to collect the
fuel and sell it by the bucket along roadsides, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   At the scene Thursday, firefighters sprayed chemical foam and
water on the fire, which was still smoldering after damaging or
destroying many buildings within a one-mile radius. Some bodies
still lay in the field nearby. The area was filled with the
overpowering stench of gasoline and rotting flesh.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy closely resembled an accident in nearby Jesse, where
more than 700 people were killed in 1998. Since then, the
government has tried to educate villagers about the danger of
''scooping,'' the illegal practice of scavenging fuel from
pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the pipeline here had been sabotaged seven times
since January, state oil officials said. David Onos, a former
police officer, said some villagers took the risk because of
poverty -- the illegal fuel trade was their only source of income.
</P>
<P>
   ''The petrol has caused too much pain. It must stop,'' Onos
said. ''The government must urgently provide jobs and a means of
livelihood for the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of cases of pipeline sabotage are reported each year in
Nigeria. Some are carried out by militants trying to force the
government and oil companies to compensate communities for land use
and alleged pollution. In other cases, villagers collect fuel for
generators and other motors.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria is the world's sixth-largest oil exporter, accounting
for about one-twelfth of oil imported by the United States.

<HEADLINE> Gene Linked to Arthritis Located  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers experimenting with mice have found
a gene that may play a role in preventing arthritis-like disorders
in joints.
</P>
<P>
   In a study to be published Friday in the journal Science, David
Kingsley, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute researcher at Stanford
University, reports a gene called ank appears to help produce a
fluid that keeps joints operating smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   When the gene is flawed, Kingsley and his co-authors said, there
can be a buildup of mineral deposits that causes joints in mice to
become inflamed. Eventually, the joints are destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The gene was located by studying a mouse species that naturally
develops a severe progressive arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Kingsley said the researchers found the gene makes a protein ANK
that causes the movement into the joints of a fluid, called
pyrophosphate, which prevents the buildup of calcium in the joints.
Pyrophosphate is a chemical now used in some toothpastes to control
tartar and the buildup of hard plaque on tooth surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   When the ank gene is mutated, such as in the tested mouse,
minerals are deposited in many of the bony joints, causing them to
stiffen and eventually to not move at all.
</P>
<P>
   Kingsley said that the type of arthritis found in the mouse is
very severe and not a perfect mimic of human arthritis, although
some of the same processes are involved.
</P>
<P>
   ''By studying a severe form of disease in an animal model, we
hoped we might be able to identify basic molecular mechanisms that
may apply to milder forms of disease as well,'' Kingsley said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Kingsley said the ank gene is present in humans and in most
other vertebrates, but not in invertebrates, which are animals that
lack boney skeletons.
</P>
<P>
   ''This suggests that the gene may control some process specific
to vertebrates, like the function or maintenance of cartilage and
bone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arthritis is a group of diseases that affect about half of
people 65 and older, accounting for about $100 billion annually in
medical costs in the U.S.

<HEADLINE> Creator of Soca Music Dies at 59  </HEADLINE>
By TONY FRASER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) -- Ras Shorty I, creator of soca, a
fusion of calypso and an up-tempo beat he said represented the true
soul of calypso, has died. He was 59.
</P>
<P>
   Shorty died of bone cancer at a friend's home Wednesday night,
following weeks of modern and traditional herbal treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are all grief stricken,'' said Protector, the spokesman of
the Calypsonians Association of Trinidad and Tobago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shorty was able to succeed in his attempts to modernize
calypso, especially to package it for young people, and I recognize
him as the Father of Soca,'' calypso performer Mighty Sparrow said
Thursday in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Ras Shorty I was born Garfield Blackman and started singing
calypso as Lord Shorty.
</P>
<P>
   He fused traditional calypso with an up-tempo ''soca'' beat,
what he called the ''Indianization of calypso,'' bringing together
the music of his Caribbean nation's two major ethnic groups,
descendants of African slaves and of indentured laborers from
India.
</P>
<P>
   In ''Endless Vibrations,'' his first soca song composed in 1974,
he sang of his need to ''change the musical structure, make it
super sweeter ... bring out that funky feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the start of a major transformation of the traditional
calypso beat. Dozens of musicians adopted his style, taking soca to
the dance halls of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Shorty would soon undergo a transformation himself. He became a
Rastafarian and changed his name to Ras Shorty I. He moved with his
family to a forest and dramatically changed his music to
spiritually uplifting lyrics and a new rhythm he called jamoo.
</P>
<P>
   Shorty is survived by his wife, Claudette, and their 14
children. Funeral arrangements were not announced.

<HEADLINE> Clinton OKs Colombia, Kosovo Aid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton signed an $11.2 billion
measure Thursday that includes a tenfold increase in money for
Colombia's war against drugs and funds for U.S. peacekeeping forces
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Colombia is a strong ally and the oldest democracy
in Latin America. ''Today it is under attack -- from civil conflict
and drug trafficking that fuels violence, undercuts honest
enterprise and undermines public confidence in democracy,'' the
president said.
</P>
<P>
   The measure provides $1.3 billion to help equip and train
Colombian forces battling cocaine and heroin producers controlling
southern sections of the country. As the bill moved through
Congress, some lawmakers warned of being dragged into a
Vietnam-type of unwinnable war.
</P>
<P>
   ''As Colombians fight to build their democracy and block the
illegal drug trade, they are fighting for all of us,'' Clinton said
in a signing statement. ''If they are willing to take up the fight,
we should be willing to take on some of the cost.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert said the drug package was ''a
shared accomplishment between the Republican House and the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   The $11.2 billion bill was twice the amount that Clinton
requested four months ago. Lawmakers more than doubled Clinton's
defense request to $6.4 billion and also included hundreds of
millions for election-year, home-state projects ranging from New
York City's proposed Second Avenue subway to the crabbing industry
in Alaska, Washington state and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   The package contained $2 billion for U.S. peacekeeping troops in
Kosovo; $661 million to help New Mexico recover from blazes that
charred Los Alamos and other communities; and $350 million for
fighting other wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the Kosovo money, Clinton said, ''NATO forces won
the war in 78 days; it will take longer to secure a stable peace. I
applaud Congress for sending a message that we will stand by our
troops until the job is done.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also $360 million to help North Carolina and other
states hit by last September's Hurricane Floyd and farm problems,
and $600 million to help low-income families pay their utility
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also managed to find $45 million to buy a Gulfstream
executive jet for the Coast Guard's commandant; $8.4 million to
help the White House reconstruct the lost e-mails that
congressional investigators are hunting; and $17.5 million to fix
some of the Capitol's numerous fire hazards.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also had $7 million to help Hawaiian fishing boats
avoid snagging sea turtles; $112 million to reimburse California,
Arizona, New Mexico and Texas for costs of dealing with illegal
immigrants and smuggling; and $2 million to help refurbish the rail
link between Danbury and Norwalk, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the legislation ''is disappointing for what it
leaves out.'' He complained that it lacks money for debt relief for
the world's poorest countries and ''offers inadequate funding'' for
Mozambique and other southern African nations devastated by
flooding. Furthermore, he said that it ''undercuts U.S. interests''
by omitting money for U.N. peacekeeping operations in Southeast
Europe.

<HEADLINE> Lou Gehrig's disease sufferer jumps off parking garage  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - A man killed himself Thursday by
jumping off a casino parking garage, the third such suicide in as
many months.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Pidgeon, 51, of Blackwood, who suffered from Lou Gehrig's
disease, plunged 120 feet from the roof of the Caesars Atlantic
City Hotel Casino garage about 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   He died at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Gloucester Township had been searching for Pidgeon
since Monday, when family members reported him missing, according
to Deputy Chief Michael Senatore of the Gloucester Township Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   He suffered from Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, an incurable,
fatal nerve disorder that robs its victims of even basic movements
like swallowing.
</P>
<P>
   The disease is named after New York Yankees great Lou Gehrig,
who died of it in 1941. It wasn't clear how long ago Pidgeon was
diagnosed with the disease or how far it had progressed. Typically,
victims live between two and five years after being diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   He was still able to walk, talk and drive a car, according to
Senatore. His adult son, who reported him missing, said he was
worried because Pidgeon would become disoriented and could suffer
seizures if he didn't have his medication, according to Senatore.
</P>
<P>
   Pidgeon had recently lost his job, but Senatore didn't know what
it had been or where.
</P>
<P>
   No suicide note was left at the scene, according to Sgt. Michael
Tullio, a spokesman for the Atlantic City Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Victims of ALS sometimes look to suicide after being diagnosed
because they fear the paralysis that awaits them, according to Mary
Lyons, vice president of The ALS Association, of Calabasas Hills,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Youk, 53, of Waterford, Mich., whose assisted 1998
suicide at the hands of Dr. Jack Kevorkian was televised on ''60
Minutes,'' suffered from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although patients want to know about their options, it's not
common that they go ahead and make that choice. The majority of
people are dying a quiet and peaceful death,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tullio, a police spokesman, said police were trying to find out
where Pidgeon was between Monday and Thursday. He appealed for
anyone with information to contact Atlantic City police.
</P>
<P>
   ''God, isn't it awful?'' said Diana Whiteman, a bartender at
DeFeo's Lounge, which is located down the block from the Missouri
Avenue sidewalk where Pidgeon landed. ''People were staying in here
this morning because they didn't want to go out and have to see the
body.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the third casino parking garage suicide this year.
</P>
<P>
   On April 4, a dealer at the Sands Hotel Casino jumped to his
death from the Trump Plaza parking garage. On May 26, a former
employee of Trump Marina leaped from the garage there.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, three people died in casino jumps. One jumped from

<HEADLINE> Federal Reserve May Buy Less  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve, which is having to adjust
its portfolio management because of shrinking debt issues, may buy
$30 billion less of Treasury securities over the next two years, a
Treasury official indicated Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''While many things may change over the next 24 months, based on
the Federal Reserve's current holdings and Treasury's current
auction sizes, the new procedure could lead to net redemptions
approaching $30 billion in coupon securities,'' Gary Gensler,
Treasury's under secretary for domestic finance, said in a speech
to the Bond Market Association in New York.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Fed may be forced to go the secondary market to
replace the securities it can't buy directly from Treasury, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Gensler also said that Treasury, against the backdrop of budget
surpluses and efforts to reduce debt, is continuing to consider
eliminating the one-year Treasury bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a limited number of statutory provisions that
reference the one-year bill for the purpose of setting interest
rates,'' he said. ''We are pleased with the progress to date of our
discussions with Congress to designate appropriate alternative
reference rates for student loans rates and other statutorily set
rates that currently reference the one-year bill.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Sprawl will eventually overwhelm watershed, hurt Bay  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER THORNE
<TEXT>
<P>
   A leading Chesapeake Bay watchdog group released a report
Thursday that warns of suburban sprawl so great it will envelop
3,500 square miles of open land in the bay's watershed over the
next quarter century.
</P>
<P>
   The new highways, parking lots and traffic congestion will add
to the pollution and runoff that harms the delicate health of the
bay, warned the Chesapeake Bay Foundation report, titled ''Land and
the Chesapeake.''
</P>
<P>
   A statistical snapshot of current land use patterns in the six
states that make up the Chesapeake Bay's watershed - Maryland,
Virginia, Pennsylvania, and parts of Delaware, New York and New
Jersey - the report predicts that newly minted agreements to
control sprawl and development may not go far enough to protect the
estuary.
</P>
<P>
   ''The future of the bay is at risk,'' said Lee Epstein, land use
manager for the Annapolis, Md.-based foundation. ''All the progress
we've made and continue to make will be for nothing if we end up
developing 3,500 square miles over the next 15 or 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The report comes two weeks after an agreement was forged between
several of the Chesapeake Bay states to reduce sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   Governors of the states pledged to reduce by 30 percent the rate
of urban sprawl in the bay region by 2012. They also resolved to
permanently protect 1.6 million acres around the bay and restore
25,000 acres of wetlands by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The accord was signed by Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening; Gov.
Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania; Gov. Jim Gilmore of Virginia; and Mayor
Anthony Williams of Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The report comes just days after Glendening was made chairman of
the National Governors' Association with a promise to advocate for
controlled growth.
</P>
<P>
   The forecast of dwindling land serves as a warning, Epstein
said, that if the agreement and other measures don't curb sprawl,
drastic results will follow.
</P>
<P>
   The report predicts the population living in the six-state bay
watershed will grow from 15.5 million to more than 18 million by
2020. It also found demand for new homes will develop 90,000 acres
of meadows, forest and farmland every year to build suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Building new homes, Epstein said, should not necessarily mean
bulldozing forests and paving new roads for suburbs. New buildings
can go up in existing towns and cities, ''filling in'' empty
pockets or poorly planned areas, without paving over more
watershed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But developers are only meeting demand, said Larry Schaffert,
president of the Maryland State Builders Association. He is also
owner of Schaffert Construction Inc., in Myersville, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe in comprehensive, planned growth, but it may come
down to what people want and what they can afford,'' Schaffert
said. ''People are moving to the suburbs because that's where they
want to live.''
</P>
<P>
   The goals of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation are already in place
in Maryland as a key element of Glendening's ''Smart Growth''
initiative, said Michelle Byrnie, a spokeswoman for the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here in Maryland, we are taking a very aggressive approach to
preserving open space and farm land, and directing growth to where
it makes sense,'' Byrnie said. ''And we are seeing the results.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, during the five years Glendening has been in
office, Maryland has permanently preserved 187,000 acres of land.
And in the last two years, the state has preserved more land than
was developed, Byrnie said.

<HEADLINE> Barak, Arafat Hold Talks at Summit  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- With a self-imposed deadline exactly two
months away, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat are grappling with the ''tough issues'' that
must be resolved to conclude a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   They decided on their own to meet face-to-face Wednesday night
for about an hour in Arafat's Birch cabin at Camp David, which the
late Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin occupied 22 years ago in
negotiating peace terms with Egypt's Anwar Sadat.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatic sources said the talks were serious but did not
produce a breakthrough on any of the core issues.
</P>
<P>
   These include the future of Jerusalem, the fate of Jewish
settlements in the West Bank and in Gaza, and whether more than 2
million Palestinian refugees will be given the right to return to
homes in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Barak signaled before the summit that he would agree to a
Palestinian foothold in predominantly Arab neighborhoods of
Jerusalem, would roll up most of the settlements and accept
thousands of Palestinians who have families living in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Arafat has given no indication publicly that his
demands for virtually all of the West Bank and a state with its
capital in Jerusalem are negotiable.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who has expressed hope for an agreement
before his scheduled departure for Japan for an economic summit
meeting in less than a week, turned the reins over to Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright for most of Thursday. She met with Arafat
and planned to meet with Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said at the White House that he would tell the two
leaders ''to forgive and reconcile'' as the United States and
Vietnam were doing in boost trade.
</P>
<P>
   ''The secretary will continue the pattern of meetings that have
been occurring over the last two days, and will continue to work on
moving the ball forward,'' the summit spokesman Richard Boucher
said, without disclosing specific plans for Thursday's sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, addressing the NAACP convention in Baltimore, said he
hoped the summit would ''resolve the profound differences that have
kept the people of the Middle East apart for a very long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Invoking the memory of the late civil rights crusader Martin
Luther King Jr., Clinton told NAACP delegates, ''I know that in our
quest for a full, fair and final peace -- which Dr. King reminded us
is more than the absence of war but the presence of justice and
brotherhood and genuine reconciliation -- I know we will have your
prayers and your best wishes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because you embody the spirit of freedom and reconciliation
we're trying to capture there, that we need so badly in our
talks,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House adhered to its refusal to discuss the substance
of the peace talks. And Boucher, who filled in for presidential
spokesman Joe Lockhart, followed the instruction.
</P>
<P>
   ''Welcome to the daily press blackout,'' he told reporters at
the outset.
</P>
<P>
   And that was about all he had to say.

<HEADLINE> Well-known artifact shop damaged in partial building collapse  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS OLERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Two floors collapsed Thursday at a lower
Manhattan architectural salvage shop specializing in period pieces
for movie sets and residential renovations.
</P>
<P>
   One person, a construction worker, suffered bruises; nine others
escaped injury, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, two brownstones collapsed in Brooklyn's Boerum
Hill neighborhood, killing three residents. Investigators were
still trying to determine on Thursday whether a gas explosion was
to blame.
</P>
<P>
   The four-story Lower East Side building, home to Irreplaceable
Artifacts, was undergoing some sort of construction, Giuliani said.
But he said building officials were searching for work permits.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are no permits for construction that we've been able to
find quickly,'' Giuliani later told a City Hall news conference.
''A lot of the bricks that fell are new bricks ... and this is a
building that dates from the 19th Century.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also said the building had code violations in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen said ''there was very, very
heavy stuff'' on a floor that collapsed. He added that some floors
had been shored up after a fire 1&AMP;frac12; years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse left a gaping 2&AMP;frac12;-story hole in the structure,
leaving a clear view of the crumpled and twisted interior. The
fourth floor appeared to be intact.
</P>
<P>
   Von Essen said the remains of the building were in ''a very
dangerous condition.'' Nine families from a seven-story apartment
building next door were relocated.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse temporarily disrupted service on the subway's F
line. Trains were running, but bypassing that stop.
</P>
<P>
   Irreplaceable Artifacts sells architectural pieces, including
wooden doors, mantles, railings and elaborate moldings, from
buildings torn down around the city. Owned by Evan Blum, its
memorabilia has turned up in ''Angel Heart,'' starring Robert
DeNiro and Mickey Rourke; ''Sophie's Choice;'' and Woody Allen's
''Zelig.''

<HEADLINE> President-Elect Fox Plans Advisors  </HEADLINE>
By NIKO PRICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's president-elect said Thursday he
will create a close-knit team of seven advisers who will ''demand
results in the name of the president'' and oversee the major
changes he plans after 71 years of single-party rule.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with foreign journalists, Vicente Fox described a
governing style very different from that of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which has held the presidency since
1929. Under the PRI, the president had sweeping authority, and most
orders came directly from him.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said he would delegate much of his work after he is sworn in
on Dec. 1, creating a new level of czars between him and the
Cabinet that would answer directly to him, and would spur his
Cabinet members to meet goals.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the czars will handle a specific theme: corruption,
poverty, Indians, small loans, the economy, education and social
development.
</P>
<P>
   ''They will have very small staffs,'' he said. ''They will go to
the secretariats to recommend plans, give them suggestions and
demand results in the name of the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox has hired several headhunting firms to scour Mexico -- and
Mexicans in the United States -- for talent that could work in his
government. He pledged to interview the top three candidates for
each post personally, forming his government in two months.
</P>
<P>
   ''If in those two months I can form a team that is professional,
talented, executive, globally competitive, serious, honest and
transparent, I certainly won't spend much time in the office. I'll
leave the work to them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would travel constantly around Mexico, talking to
people from all backgrounds to get a better idea of what people
want and how the government is responding to their needs. He said
he would meet weekly with his Cabinet to map out the week's
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Fox also said he considers it urgent to begin meetings with
other parties in an attempt to draft a multiparty plan for
political, economic and social reform. He wants to meet with the
two main presidential candidates he defeated within two weeks to
get them on board.
</P>
<P>
   But he conceded that the PRI and the leftist opposition, which
is also trying to reinvent itself after Fox's stunning victory,
will probably reject his overtures to ally with him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see that as a very possible reality,'' he said. ''Whoever is
governing, the other two parties tend to oppose him.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said if that happens, he will seek out members of Congress
from the other parties and try to win them over one by one.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without an agreement, we'll have to govern with whatever we
can get,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's party doesn't have a majority in either house of Congress,
and the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, still holds 21
of Mexico's 31 governorships.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said he plans to travel to South America -- Brazil, Argentina
and Chile, and possibly another country -- in the first half of
August, and to Washington to meet with President Clinton in the
second half of August.

<HEADLINE> Appeals court upholds record verdict against Time Warner  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) - The Georgia Court of Appeals on Thursday upheld a
record $454 million verdict against Time Warner Inc., over alleged
mismanagement of Six Flags over Georgia. Time Warner said it will
appeal the decision.
</P>
<P>
   A Gwinnett County jury awarded investors of Six Flags Over
Georgia the largest civil award in state history in December 1998
after finding that Time Warner sought to depress the park's value
and withheld money and information from the partnership that owned
it. Time Warner held the controlling stake in the group.
</P>
<P>
   The jury awarded plaintiffs $197 million in compensatory damages
and $257 million in punitive damages after a six-week trial.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner president Richard Parsons called the court's ruling
Thursday ''unfortunate'' and said the verdict was ''unfounded and
the result of a profoundly unfair trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner and its partners sold the Six Flags chain of theme
parks in February 1998 to Premier Parks, an Oklahoma City-based
amusement park operator, for $1.9 billion. Premier has since
changed its name to Six Flags Inc.

<HEADLINE> Nurse's aide gets up to 50 years for raping elderly woman  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WAMPSVILLE, N.Y. (AP) - A former nurse's aide was sentenced to
between 25 years and 50 years in prison Thursday for repeatedly
raping a 92-year-old patient at a Madison County nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Wallace, 42, of Sherburne was arrested in February and
charged with sexually assaulting the woman five times in September
and October 1997 while a nurse's aide at the Oneida City Hospital
Extended Care Facility.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace was found guilty of five counts of first-degree rape in
May, and sentenced to two consecutive terms of 12&AMP;frac12; years to 25
years in prison Thursday by Madison County Court Judge Hugh
Humphreys. He was also sentenced to three concurrent 12&AMP;frac12;
year-to-25-year terms.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace had been fired at the Oneida health care facility in
September 1998 for sexually harassing fellow employees.
</P>
<P>
   According to state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, Wallace had
been court-martialed from the U.S. Army prior to working in Oneida
for having lewd and lascivious contact with a minor. He failed to
note in his application in Oneida that he had any prior criminal
convictions, Spitzer said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces $5M for Diabetes  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping for the ''true miracle'' of curing
diabetes, President Clinton on Thursday announced a $5 million
effort for clinical trials on a promising treatment for the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   During a speech before the NAACP, Clinton announced that the
National Institutes of Health and the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation
would release $5 million to 10 centers for research into a new
technique for transplanting cells in the pancreas, which produce
insulin.
</P>
<P>
   A team at the University of Alberta tested the procedure, called
islet transplantation, on seven patients with severe Type 1
diabetes, also known as juvenile diabetes. All of them have been
able to maintain normal blood sugar without taking insulin shots.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said more research is needed ''so we can prove it wasn't
an accident'' and hopefully speed up the day when a cure is found.
He told the NAACP the findings held especially great import for
minorities, who are more likely than whites to be afflicted with
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we can repeat these preliminary findings, it could put a
cure for juvenile diabetes within our reach, a true miracle,''
Clinton said. ''We're going to do everything we can about it, and I
hope we'll have some of your prayers and your support. It's worth
some of your money to spend on that.''
</P>
<P>
   The funds announced Thursday will go to centers in Boston;
Edmonton, Canada; Miami, Minneapolis, St. Louis, Seattle and
Bethesda, Md., as well as Geneva, Switzerland; Giessen, Germany and
Milan, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The trials, on 40 patients aged 18-65 who are unable to control
their blood sugars even with strict adherence to insulin
treatments, are scheduled to begin this fall. They will receive
islet transplants over the next 18 months. Children are ineligible
for the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Some 1 million Americans have Type 1 diabetes, and approximately
25 percent of them are minorities. The White House said 30,000 new
cases are diagnosed each year, 13,000 of them among children.
Overall, some 16 million people are diabetic, and one in four black
women over age 55 have the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The immune systems of Type 1 diabetes sufferers destroy
pancreatic cells that secrete insulin, which is needed to convert
sugar into energy. They must get regular insulin shots to survive;
Without the shots, they could go blind or develop life-threatening
complications, such as kidney failure.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also highlighted his recent request for $300 million
over five years for diabetes treatment and prevention. ''We would
like to see our children lifted from the burden and the fear, and
the terrors and the agony, that can come with juvenile diabetes,''
Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> SEC Employees Vote on Union  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A union spokesman said turnout was heavy
Thursday among employees of the Securities and Exchange Commission
in a vote on whether to join the National Treasury Employees Union.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout has been ''great,'' spokesman Jim Watkins said.
</P>
<P>
   The vote has been opposed for months by SEC officials, who
wanted employees at the Washington headquarters to be represented
by a separate bargaining unit from those in the agency's regional
offices around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute delayed a vote first scheduled for last September by
SEC employees on joining the NTEU, which represents about 155,000
workers in 26 federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Labor Relations Authority ruled against the SEC in
January. The SEC appealed the ruling; its appeal was rejected this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   The union needs to get a simple majority of votes cast to become
the SEC employees' official representative to negotiate with
management. NTEU officials have said they were confident, although
there appears to be far less support for the union among the SEC's
1,200 or so professional employees, mainly attorneys and
accountants, than from the 650 other employees who are eligible to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Professional employees also are voting on whether to join the
same bargaining unit as their non-professional colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Employees have complained that they are expected to work
uncompensated extra hours, known as ''donated'' time, and that
bonus money is seldom given to career employees.
</P>
<P>
   The NTEU represents employees at the Internal Revenue Service,
the U.S. Customs Service, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and
the Food and Drug Administration, among others.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Rise on Earnings Reports  </HEADLINE>
By DUNSTAN PRIAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed higher Thursday as investors took
a cautious but mostly optimistic view of another batch of strong
second-quarter earnings reports.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 5.30 at 10,788.71.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also closed higher. The Nasdaq
composite index finished up 75.27 at 4,174.86 and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose 2.92 to 1,495.84.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors traded cautiously in the wake of a
strong rally Wednesday, which many believe was a so-called
technical rally, or one in which stocks rise temporarily despite
broader trends that indicate stocks may be in a long-term slump.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, investor optimism has been fed by strong earnings
in several key sectors, including technology and financial
services.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, investors have apparently taken temporary comfort
in the fact that fuel costs appear to have stabilized, as well as a
general belief that the Federal Reserve Board may be finished
raising interest rates for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it's earnings that continue to be the driving force,''
said Ricky Harrington, technical analyst with Wachovia Securities
in Charlotte, N.C., said. ''The market, temporarily at least,
doesn't appear to be concerned with interest rates or energy
prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington said that optimism could be tested Friday, when the
Producer Price Index figures for June are released. The PPI, which
measures producers' costs for making goods, is used widely as a
barometer of inflation because if producers' costs are rising,
those costs will ultimately be passed on to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Strong earnings reports helped the technology sector advance for
a second straight session Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The surge was led by Ariba, which closed up $27.688 to $131.188.
The Internet software company reported narrower than expected
fiscal third-quarter losses and said it will be profitable within a
year. In addition, its alliance with International Business
Machines and i2 Technologies was selected to build a planned
Internet commerce marketplace called WorldWide Retail Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Semiconductor stocks also flourished. Applied Micro Circuits was
up $28.062 to $153.50, and PMC-Sierra rose $20.875 to $228.938.
</P>
<P>
   And cellular phone maker Motorola jumped $4 to $39.50 after
announcing that its second-quarter earnings will match Wall
Street's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But Yahoo!, whose better-than-expected earnings served as the
catalyst for Wednesday's rally, finished down $2.375 to $122.563 as
some investors took profits.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan rose $1.562 to $124.125 after the investment bank
reported second-quarter earnings of $2.90 a share, up from $2.52
cents a year ago. Wall Street analysts had predicted the company's
earnings would decline to $2.45 last quarter.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence of the cautious environment, many so-called old
economy stocks fared poorly Thursday. For example, General Electric
reported solid earnings but its shares closed down $1.125 to
$52.375. Drug companies also suffered. Bristol Myers Squibb fell
$3.078 to $52.922 and Merck declined $4.344 to $69.047.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues were slightly ahead of decliners on the New
York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.02 billion shares, up
from Wednesday's pace of 994.63 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 2.51 at 542.76.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.76 percent.
Germany's DAX index was up 1.84 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was
down 0.66 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.52 percent.

<HEADLINE> Two shore towns adopt underage drinking measures  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AVALON, N.J. (AP) - Beach communities eager to crack down on
underage drinking have a new tool, and they are wasting no time
using it.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by a new law, borough councils in Avalon and Surf City
voted Wednesday to enact ordinances banning the possession of
alcohol in private by minors. Ship Bottom is expected to follow
suit next week.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, people under 21 could not be charged if caught
drinking or possessing alcohol in private.
</P>
<P>
   But last month, Gov. Christie Whitman signed into law a measure
that gives municipalities the power to fine and suspend the
driver's license of any minor caught possessing alcohol in private.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, violators are subject to a $200 fine for the first
offense and a $350 fine for subsequent offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The law is aimed at shore town ''animal houses'' where teens
party during the summer, according to its sponsor, state Sen.
Leonard Connors, R-Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Exceptions will be made for minors who work where alcohol is
present and those participating in religious services.
</P>
<P>
   Connors said police won't be looking in windows to prosecute
minors. But if they are called to a home for another reason - such
as noise - and learn minors have alcohol in the house, summonses
can be issued.
</P>
<P>
   In Avalon, the underage drinking ordinance marks the latest
effort to clamp down on rowdy summer behavior. In 1997, police
began enforcing an ordinance that banned minors from being ''in the
presence of alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 500 people were arrested over the July Fourth weekend
that year. But the arrests triggered a federal court case that said
police did not have probable cause to enter premises for the
arrests, and the borough ended up paying $1.5 million in a
settlement and repealing its ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   In Surf City, nine of every 10 noise complaints received by
police in summer are associated with underage drinking, according
to police Lt. Martin McNulty.
</P>
<P>
   Others municipalities are considering enacting similar
ordinances, Connors said. He said the threat of loss of license
will be a deterrent for some - not all - minors who drink.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the most prized things young adults have is a driver's
license,'' said Connors. ''They're going to get the message.''

   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - A tourist destination wouldn't normally tout
the fact that it has sharks, but that's just what Camden did
Thursday, in announcing the name of the city's new minor-league
baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   The Camden Riversharks of the Atlantic League will begin play in
the spring of 2001. A 6,425-seat stadium is being built on the
waterfront and is scheduled to be ready by early May, ''weather
permitting,'' said team owner Steve Shilling.
</P>
<P>
   The team logo features a gray shark baring its teeth as it cuts
through a light blue and navy wave. A white baseball with red
stitching is the backdrop. The logo will appear on T-shirts, golf
shirts and caps. Fans already began buying the clothing at
Thursday's event at the Camden Children's Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we have an identity,'' General Manager John Brandt said.
''People will know who we are. And our name and logo reflect not
only our pride in being located in Camden, but also our pride in
being part of the revitalization effort along the city's
waterfront.''
</P>
<P>
   City school children chose the team name in a contest in the
spring. More than 10,000 students in kindergarten through eighth
grade voted from seven choices. (The others were the Batts,
Cowfish, Craze, Crickets, Rivermen and Waterdogs.)
</P>
<P>
   The school that had the highest percentage of voter
participation will receive $10,000 from the baseball team to be
used for athletic equipment. All of the students who voted for the
winning name will get two free tickets to a home game during the
opening season.
</P>
<P>
   The team will play 70 home games and 70 road games per season.
The league is comprised of minor league players and those from
college and semipro ranks. The Atlantic City Surf, Newark Bears and
Somerset Patriots play in the league. The league also has teams in
Bridgeport, Conn.; Lehigh Valley, Pa.; Long Island, N.Y.; Aberdeen,
Md.; and Nashua, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium, on Delaware Avenue at the foot of the Benjamin
Franklin Bridge, will have 19 suites, a restaurant, picnic area and
children's play area. It will be owned by Rutgers University-Camden
and also will be home to the school's team. The firm Camden
Baseball LLC will lease and operate the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Shilling has said the stadium will create 270 jobs on game days.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Extradites Drug Suspect  </HEADLINE>
By MARGARITA MARTINEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Colombia extradited a suspected cocaine
smuggler to the United States on Thursday, the second time
President Andres Pastrana has sent one of his countryman to stand
trial abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Garcia, an alleged member of a gang that shipped cocaine
to the United States, departed Bogota's international airport on a
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration plane for New York.
</P>
<P>
   He was escorted onto the tarmac by some 200 police officers.
</P>
<P>
   The 47-year-old faces a New Jersey indictment for allegedly
shipping 230 pounds of cocaine into the United States, Colombian
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking improved ties with Washington, Pastrana has resumed
extraditions from Colombia after a decade-long hiatus. A heroin
suspect Pastrana sent to the United States in November was the
first Colombian extradited since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have long complained that Colombia's
corruption-riddled justice system is incapable of handing down
tough sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's extradition comes just two weeks after the U.S.
Congress approved a $1.3 billion aid package for battling narcotics
traffickers and leftist rebels who protect the drug trade in
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, White House drug czar Barry McCaffrey saluted the
extradition as ''a dramatic breakthrough, an example of Colombian
democracy and the process working well.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia was arrested in February 1999 along with 18 alleged
members of a smuggling ring dubbed ''Los Niches'' that shipped out
the cocaine through the western port of Buenaventura.
</P>
<P>
   The gang's purported kingpin, Jorge Asprilla, remains in prison
-- one of at least 50 Colombians facing U.S. extradition requests.
</P>
<P>
   Among those battling their handover in Colombian courts is Fabio
Ochoa, a former top leader of the Medellin cartel led by the late
Pablo Escobar.
</P>
<P>
   Ochoa was one of 30 people arrested last October in Operation
Millennium, a sweep against a drug gang suspected of shipping as
much as 30 tons of cocaine monthly to the United States via Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In extraditing nationals, Pastrana is braving a possible
terrorist backlash.
</P>
<P>
   A powerful car bomb thought to have been placed by drug
traffickers went off in Bogota just days before Pastrana extradited
the heroin suspect last November, killing eight bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion revived terrible memories of Escobar's heyday in
the late-1980s, when the cartels set off bombs and assassinated
scores of people in a successful campaign to discourage
extradition.

<P>
   At her weekly news briefing for reporters, Reno said she
received the written recommendation of task force chief Robert
Conrad on Tuesday. Conrad favors appointing a special counsel to
probe whether Gore lied about his knowledge of fund-raising
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to consider anything that anybody wants to present, so
I'm awaiting ... the recommendation of others,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 and 1998, top Justice Department officials weighed in
with opinions on whether an outside prosecutor was needed to probe
Gore and both times Reno rejected such a move.
</P>
<P>
   Reno offered no specific time for her decision.
</P>
<P>
   Reno also said ''I am not commenting'' on whether an
investigation had been concluded -- or had even been undertaken --
into who leaked word of Conrad's verbal recommendation for a Gore
probe several weeks ago to Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to keep the focus on the Gore fund-raising questions,
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., announced a
hearing next Thursday on banning soft money solicitations on
federal property.
</P>
<P>
   It is illegal to solicit campaign money on federal property.
Gore made calls from the White House but maintains he was raising
only ''soft money'' -- unlimited donations that corporations, labor
unions and some individuals give to political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money solicitation is exempt from the election laws.

<HEADLINE> Appeals court judges critical of Volpe's appeal  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Federal appeals court judges Thursday rejected a
lawyer's suggestion that former police officer Justin Volpe did not
plan to sexually assault Abner Louima.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't think there was a planned sexual assault when they
went into the bathroom?'' Judge John M. Walker Jr. of the 2nd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals asked during arguments about the legality
of the 30-year prison term given Volpe.
</P>
<P>
   ''No I do not your honor,'' responded Volpe's attorney, Alan
Chaset of Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ''What did he have the stick for?'' the judge asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think he knew what he had the stick for,'' Chaset
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh c'mon,'' Walker said, interrupting the lawyer who was
trying to convince the judges that U.S. District Court Judge Eugene
Nickerson in Brooklyn had sentenced Volpe too harshly for
sodomizing Louima with a broken broomstick on Aug. 9, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Chaset said Nickerson misinterpreted federal sentencing
guidelines, unfairly penalizing his client multiple times for the
same offenses and failing to credit him for naming the other
officer in the bathroom during the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe pleaded guilty in the middle of his trial last year. He
arrested Louima after mistaking the 30-year-old security guard for
someone who punched him in the head as police tried to break up an
unruly crowd outside a Brooklyn nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Sonia Sotomayor warned Chaset early in Thursday's
proceeding that it might be dangerous to argue Volpe's sentence was
excessive rather than merely challenging Nickerson's legal
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ''What happens when we think the sentence imposed is too lenient
and not sufficient for the act committed?'' Sotomayor asked Chaset,
suggesting that the appeals court might actually seek to increase
the prison term if it decided the case based on the brutality of
the crime.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, Chaset said Volpe might not have sodomized
Louima if he had not encountered the defendant at the front desk
with his pants down.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really think your argument should not try to exonerate the
seriousness of this crime and what Mr. Volpe did by somehow arguing
that he's less than morally culpable,'' Walker said. ''That's just
not going to work.''
</P>
<P>
   ''When they went into the bathroom, it's a fair inference they
did so, and Mr. Volpe did so, with the ultimate outcome firmly in
mind,'' Walker said. ''It wasn't a spontaneous act on his part.''
</P>
<P>
   Sotomayor agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''He goes to another room, finds the broomstick, breaks it ...
hides one end of it and brings another to the bathroom and then
gets Mr. Louima. How can't it be premeditated that he intended to
do something with that stick and it was not something nice,''
Sotomayor asked.
</P>
<P>
   Chaset said Volpe might have planned to hit Louima with the
stick or threaten him with it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think there is any specific evidence we can point to
that says the intent, the plan, was to commit the assault that was
eventually committed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chaset said outside court that the best he could hope for was to
reduce Volpe's sentence by half if the appeals court agreed with
his legal challenges.
</P>
<P>
   The court reserved decision.

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A health care company will pay $53 million to
settle allegations of overcharging in Medicare, Medicaid and the
Defense Department's TRICARE health care program, the Justice
Department announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement with GAMBRO Healthcare Inc. involved accusations
of double-billing and medically unnecessary tests for patients with
kidney problems by a pair of GAMBRO subsidiaries at labs in Fort
Lauderdale and Deland, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The Deland lab was closed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the settlement, GAMBRO and a subsidiary, Healthcare
Laboratory Services Inc., are entering a comprehensive five-year
corporate integrity agreement with the companies undergoing annual
independent audits and providing compliance training to employees.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged overcharging was discovered in an investigation by
the inspector general's office of the Department of Health and

<HEADLINE> CRDA grant completes funding to rehabilitate Paulsdale  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOUNT LAUREL, N.J. (AP) - A group planning to renovate the
birthplace of Quaker suffragist Alice Paul can begin work, now that
the final funding has been granted.
</P>
<P>
   The Casino Reinvestment Development Authority has contributed
$328,000 for renovation of Paulsdale, Paul's Mount Laurel
birthplace, the agency announced Thursday. The funds were provided
by Bally's Park Place Casino Resort.
</P>
<P>
   The money will be used to complete a match required by the New
Jersey Historic Trust, which granted $478,000 to the Alice Paul
Centennial Foundation in 1998 for the restoration project. Last
year, the foundation received $150,000 in matching funds from the
Heritage Investment Program funded by the Pew Charitable Trusts.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation is working to enhance public awareness of Paul's
life and work. The group acquired Paulsdale in 1990 and has worked
to complete the purchase of the property, to raise funds to restore
the house and grounds and to develop Paulsdale as a leadership
development center for women and girls.
</P>
<P>
   With the rehabilitation of Paulsdale, 6 1/2 acres of open space
in Burlington County will be preserved. The site will be part of
the New Jersey Women's Heritage Trail, which is being developed.
</P>
<P>
   Paul was born in Paulsdale in 1885. A radical suffragette, she
campaigned to win women the right to vote and authored the first
Equal Rights amendment. She died in a Moorestown nursing home in
1977 at age 92.
</P>
<P>
   Paulsdale, a three-story 19th century white farmhouse, was
designated a National Historic Landmark by the U.S. Department of
the Interior in 1991. Last year, the site was recognized by the
President's Commission on the Celebration of Women in American
History as one of six historic sites nationwide whose leaders were
''saving American treasures.'' It also was named by the National
Trust for Historic Preservation as an official Save America's
Treasures Project.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer: Harris' hands will not be shackled in death row stomping trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FREEHOLD, N.J. (AP) - Death row inmate Ambrose Harris will wear
shackles around his ankles but his hands will be free during an
upcoming trial, according to a published report.
</P>
<P>
   Harris is accused of stomping to death fellow death row inmate
Robert ''Mudman'' Simon on Sept. 7, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers filed a motion asking that Harris be unshackled
when he meets with them at the prison. Prosecutors filed a
competing motion asking that Harris not only continue to wear
shackles around his hands and feet during those meetings, but also
during his trial.
</P>
<P>
   They argued the shackles are needed to protect guards and others
in the courtroom against any violent outburst. State Superior Court
Judge Paul F. Chaiet said he would make the decision if the two
sides could not come to an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Harris' attorney James Barletti told The Times of Trenton in
Thursday's edition that the defense counsel and the prosecutors
agreed that his client would wear only leg irons.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Prosecutor Thomas Meidt told the newspaper he would
not comment on the agreement until the judge approves the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Barletti said he is pleased with the decision to uncuff his
client.
</P>
<P>
   ''His defense is going to be one where he needs to describe what
took place and, if possible, show us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, 48, is awaiting a date with the executioner for the 1992
carjack, rape and murder of 22-year-old Kristin Huggins of Lower
Makefield, Pa. That conviction remains on appeal but has been
upheld by the state Supreme Court.

<HEADLINE> Navy Boosts in Flier Bonuses  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Navy, in an effort to keep its aviators
from flying away, is nearly doubling its bonuses for those who stay
on -- up to $245,000 for a 25-year stint.
</P>
<P>
   An immediate target is more than 100 junior aviators facing a
decision this year of leaving the Navy or seeking jobs as
commericial pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ''This program is designed to help these aviators in which the
Navy has invested so much, to decide to stay Navy,'' said Navy
personnel chief Vice Adm. Norb Ryan Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement followed an Army announcement of a new online
education program, also designed to attract and keep recruits, and
a new Navy $20,000 college bonus, as well as a plan which pays for
up to a year of college before basic training.
</P>
<P>
   The aviator bonus increases the current $125,000 maximum. New
aviators can now get that amount with just a five-year commitment,
half of it payable in advance, the Navy said.
</P>
<P>
   All services except the Marines have had difficulty meeting
recruitment goals in recent years and the Navy has been losing
pilots to commericial aviation.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton appointed a Harvard educated
psychiatrist Thursday as chair of a new commission charged with
recommending federal guidelines for the use of alternative medical
therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton created the White House Commission on Alternative
Medicine by executive order earlier this year. The commission is
supposed to recommend legislation or administration action to help
people make the most of alternative medicine while avoiding
potential risks from unproven therapies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each year, tens of millions of Americans receive alternative
therapies. The great potential and possible perils associated with
the use of complementary and alternative medicine have been well
documented,'' Clinton said in a statement issued at the White
House. ''There is no doubt that these therapies should be held to
the same standard of scientific rigor as more traditional health
care interventions.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appointed Dr. James S. Gordon, of Washington, to chair
the group. He also appointed nine other members, with others
planned later.

<HEADLINE> Retired bank manager wins $15 million verdict for botched brain surgery </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A Manhattan jury awarded a retired bank manager
$15 million Thursday for brain damage he received when surgeons
blocked blood flow through an artery in his head and caused him to
have a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   The jury awarded the money to Jose Vigo, 54, who underwent
neurosurgery at New York Hospital in April 1995 to have a benign
tumor removed from the right temporal lobe of his brain and to stop
his epileptic seizures.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel C. Minc, Vigo's lawyer, contended that Dr. Richard A.
Fraser accidentally cauterized a major blood vessel in the right
temple, thereby stopping flow to extensive areas of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Vigo suffered paralysis of the left side as well as visual
impairment in both eyes. He now uses a cane and leg brace to walk
and his left arm is useless, Minc said.
</P>
<P>
   Vigo's lawsuit, filed in Manhattan's State Supreme Court in
1996, named New York Hospital and Fraser as defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants' lawyer, George Van Setter, could not be reached
for comment. Minc said Van Setter had argued that only a minor
branch of the blood vessel, called the anterior choroidal artery,
was cauterized and that the damage to the arterial branch caused a
clot obstruction in the main artery - an acceptable risk in the
kind of surgery Vigo underwent.
</P>
<P>
   After a four-week trial, the jury apparently rejected that
argument and awarded Vigo $2 million for past pain and suffering
and $13 million for future problems.
</P>
<P>
   Vigo, who came to this country from Cuba in the mid 1970s, lives
on the Upper West Side and is a former manager of Exte Bank in
Manhattan.

<HEADLINE> UN: No Sahara Referendum Progress  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations said Thursday there has
been no progress in a dispute over who an independence referendum
for Western Sahara, suggesting that some alternative to the vote
might need to be considered.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a report to the Security
Council that negotiations on the referendum had actually moved
''backwards'' after the last round of talks between Morocco and
Western Sahara's independence-seeking rebels, held in London on
June 28.
</P>
<P>
   During those talks, which were headed by former U.S. Secretary
of State James Baker III acting as Annan's personal envoy, neither
side offered proposals to resolve their differences, which have
delayed the referendum for nearly 10 years, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They both insisted on a 'winner-take-all' approach and did not
appear willing to discuss a solution where each would get some, but
not all, of what each wanted,'' Annan wrote.
</P>
<P>
   War broke out in the Western Sahara in 1976, after Spain
abandoned the territory and Morocco annexed it, moving in settlers.
</P>
<P>
   About 15,000 guerrilla fighters from the rebel Polisario Front
battled Morocco's U.S.-equipped army until 1991, when the war ended
with a U.N.-negotiated cease-fire and plans to hold a referendum to
either remain part of Morocco or become independent.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum, however, has been stalled for years because of
disagreements over who is eligible to vote. The Polisario claims
Morocco has tried to pad the voter lists with people who have no
right to have a say in the territory's future.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has been registering voters, but tens of
thousands of people -- most of them based in Morocco -- have appealed
the rulings that they weren't eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the continuing divisions, Baker suggested possible
alternatives to a referendum during the London meeting, such as a
negotiated agreement for Western Sahara's full integration with
Morocco, full independence or something in between if the two sides
couldn't reach a final agreement on holding the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Annan repeated those options in his report. It was believed to
be the first time that the United Nations has publicly suggested
some other alternative to the referendum -- but it wasn't at all
clear that any of those options would be palatable to the two
sides.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 5; Nasdaq Is Up 75  </HEADLINE>
By DUNSTAN PRIAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed higher Thursday as investors took
a cautious but mostly optimistic view of another batch of strong
second-quarter earnings reports.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 5.30 to a revised
10,788.71.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also closed higher. The Nasdaq
composite index finished up 75.27 at 4,174.86 and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose 2.92 to 1,495.84.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors traded cautiously in the wake of a
strong rally Wednesday, which many believe was a so-called
technical rally, or one in which stocks rise temporarily despite
broader trends that indicate stocks may be in a long-term slump.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, investor optimism has been fed by strong earnings
in several key sectors, including technology and financial
services.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, investors have apparently taken temporary comfort
in the fact that fuel costs appear to have stabilized, as well as a
general belief that the Federal Reserve Board may be finished
raising interest rates for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it's earnings that continue to be the driving force,''
said Ricky Harrington, technical analyst with Wachovia Securities
in Charlotte, N.C.. ''The market, temporarily at least, doesn't
appear to be concerned with interest rates or energy prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington said that optimism could be tested Friday, when the
Producer Price Index figures for June are released. The PPI, which
measures producers' costs for making goods, is used widely as a
barometer of inflation because if producers' costs are rising,
those costs will ultimately be passed on to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Strong earnings reports helped the technology sector advance for
a second straight session Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The surge was led by Ariba, which closed up $27.688 to $131.188.
The Internet software company reported narrower than expected
fiscal third-quarter losses and said it will be profitable within a
year. In addition, its alliance with International Business
Machines and i2 Technologies was selected to build a planned
Internet commerce marketplace called WorldWide Retail Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Semiconductor stocks also flourished. Applied Micro Circuits was
up $28.062 to $153.50, and PMC-Sierra rose $20.875 to $228.938.
</P>
<P>
   And cellular phone maker Motorola jumped $3.75 to $39.25 after
announcing that its third-quarter earnings will match Wall Street's
expectations. The news came a day after the company reported strong
second-quarter results.
</P>
<P>
   But Yahoo!, whose better-than-expected earnings served as the
catalyst for Wednesday's rally, finished down $2.375 to $122.563 as
some investors took profits.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan rose $1.562 to $124.125 after the investment bank
reported second-quarter earnings of $2.90 a share, up from $2.52
cents a year ago. Wall Street analysts had predicted the company's
earnings would decline to $2.45 last quarter.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence of the cautious environment, many so-called old
economy stocks fared poorly Thursday. For example, General Electric
reported solid earnings but its shares closed down 50 cents to $53.
Drug companies also suffered. Bristol Myers Squibb fell $3.078 to
$52.938 and Merck declined $3.641 to $69.75.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues were slightly ahead of decliners on the New
York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.26 billion shares, up
from Wednesday's pace of 1.22 billion shares.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 2.51 at 542.76.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.76 percent.
Germany's DAX index was up 1.84 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was
down 0.66 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.52 percent.

<HEADLINE> Govt. Ends Radioactive Metal Sales  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Energy Department took steps Thursday to
ensure that radioactive metals are no longer recycled into braces,
zippers, toys and other consumer products, ordering a halt to sales
of thousands of tons of scrap metal left at nuclear weapons
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said sales will not resume
until weapons site managers can assure that the metals are free
from any detectable radioactive contamination. He said that by
year's end, he wanted a new standard to evaluate the material.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the recycling program contend the levels of
contamination are too low to pose a health and safety threat.
Critics of such sales have argued that metals with any trace of
contamination should not go into general commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department cannot say how much contaminated scrap
metal already has been sold, although some estimates are ''in the
low tens of thousands of tons'' over the years, according one
government source, speaking on condition of anonymity. Records on
such sales are incomplete, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't know. They don't have an inventory on how much has
gone out,'' agreed Richard Miller, an official of the paper
Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers Union, which
represents atomic plant workers. After the metal has gone into
commerce, it is melted with other like metals and is not tracked,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's decision to suspend further sales came six months
after the department canceled plans to sell 6,000 tons of nickel
from a defunct uranium enrichment plant near Oak Ridge, Tenn.,
because of concern the contaminated metal would go freely into
civilian commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's announcement stops the expected sale to private
buyers of about 15,000 tons of metal including steel, aluminum,
copper, and nickel used in machinery, furniture and remnants of
torn down buildings at closed weapons production facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Over the long term, the department has planned to sell about
30,000 tons of metals annually over 20 years as part of the
decommissioning of many of the facilities that made up the Cold
War-era nuclear weapons production complex.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear Thursday how much of that metal
eventually will be sold for recycling when the new standard is
established.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said the department was studying the possibility of
recycling much of the contaminated steel for reuse within the
weapons complex for such things as storage crates for other
contaminated material.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was halting the sales ''to ensure American consumers
that scrap metal released from Energy Department facilities for
recycling contains no detectable contamination from departmental
activities.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The suspension will remain in effect until our sites can
confirm that they meet this new more rigorous standard,'' he said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission for some time has been trying
to develop a new minimum allowable contamination level for recycled
material. It is not known when that standard will be issued.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's action drew mixed reaction from Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn., said it was ''a nonsensical decision''
that he said ignored scientific evidence that the level or
radiation found in the metals to be recycled do not pose a health
or environmental problem.
</P>
<P>
   He accused Richardson of trying to ''pander ... to key
constituencies'' -- a reference to the steelworkers union and many
environmentalists who have opposed the recycling.
</P>
<P>
   Wamp, whose district includes the Oak Ridge facility, said the
program's suspension will cost hundreds of jobs at Oak Ridge and in
recycling businesses in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who was preparing to pursue
legislation to suspend the recycling program, said Richardson's
move was ''a responsible step to protect the health and safety of
American citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ron Klink, D-Pa., who also had criticized the recycling
program, said the movement of contaminated metals threatened
steelworkers as well as the public.
</P>
<P>
   ''Recycled scrap metals can end up in everything from cars to
food containers,'' Klink said. ''Consumers have the right to know
that when they use a skillet to make hamburgers or a kettle to boil
pasta that these utensils will be free of radioactive
contamination.''

<HEADLINE> Trinidad testifies for accused IBF founder  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Longtime IBF welterweight champion Felix
Trinidad testified Thursday that he never made payoffs, or had
anyone make payoffs, to ensure good treatment by the IBF.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad, called as a defense witness, said he relinquished his
IBF belt because he could no longer stay under 147 pounds for
welterweights.
</P>
<P>
   He now fights as a junior middleweight, which has a limit of
154, and holds the WBA title in that division.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors accuse IBF founder Robert W. Lee and other IBF
officials of taking $338,000 from promoters and managers in a span
of more than a decade in exchange for favors and rigged rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors call Trinidad promoter Don King an unindicted
coconspirator, maintaining King was the prime beneficiary of Lee's
manipulations.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad (37-0, 30 knockouts) has not figured in payoffs
described in court.
</P>
<P>
   He said he knew Lee, but was not familiar with C. Douglas
Beavers, the former chairman of the IBF ratings committee who
became a government informant.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad said he did not know who did the ratings for the East
Orange-based IBF, one of the sport's three major governing bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, all of them must have a high opinion of me because I'm a
great fighter, great boxer,'' Trinidad said.
</P>
<P>
   Beavers has testified that the IBF ratings were compiled by Lee
and himself, contrary to the group's rules, which call for the
ratings committee to do the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Summations in the trial, which began in mid-April, are scheduled
to begin next week.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 66, of Fanwood, N.J., and his son, Robert Jr., 38, of
Scotch Plains, N.J., are both defendants. They face multiyear
prison terms if convicted of conspiracy, racketeering, fraud and
tax charges.

<HEADLINE> Colonel sentenced to five months in jail for role in wife's drug scheme </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Lamenting a national ''betrayal,'' a federal
judge sentenced the former commander of the military's anti-drug
operation in Colombia to five months in prison for laundering cash
from his wife's drug deals.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence in Brooklyn federal court Thursday by U.S. District
Judge Edward Korman surprised the defendant, Col. James Hiett, and
even prosecutors, who chose not to oppose his bid for probation.
Hiett's attorney had argued he deserved a break because of his
spotless 24-year military record, and because - with his wife
jailed - he is raising two sons alone.
</P>
<P>
   But Korman called Hiett's crime a ''betrayal of trust'' in the
War on Drugs, and scolded the defendant - initially for declining
to speak in court, then for not showing more remorse when he did.
</P>
<P>
   When an offender ''is in a position of trust, when someone is a
colonel in Colombia ... it undermines confidence in the military,
it undermines confidence in the country's drug program,'' Korman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hiett, 48, who has filed for retirement from the Army, pleaded
guilty in April to charges he failed to turn his cocaine-addicted
wife for a trafficking scheme in which she shipped drugs from a
post office in the U.S. embassy in Bogota to New York City. He
admitted trying to launder $25,000 in proceeds - using some to pay
bills - after he learned the Army was investigating.
</P>
<P>
   ''Can I ask you something, colonel?'' Korman said at one point,
dropping his head and rubbing his brow. ''How is it you have
nothing to say?''
</P>
<P>
   Hiett finally told the judge that prosecutors' statements that
he brought ''dishonor to myself and the military are entirely
accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ''The only thing I did, that I did consciously,
was to try to protect my wife after the fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Korman later told Hiett's attorney, Abraham Klott, that he was
''taken aback when he didn't say, 'I'm sorry.'''
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual move, the judge allowed the mother of an Army
pilot who died earlier this year on a spying mission in Colombia to
stand and demand a harsh sentence for Hiett. The family of the
pilot, Jennifer Odom, alleges Hiett has withheld information about
the crash of her plane, which the Army labeled an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Odom ''had no idea she was serving under someone who was sending
back drugs to the United States while she was going out on
anti-drug missions,'' said the mother, Janie Shafer.
</P>
<P>
   After Klott complained about the remarks, Korman insisted he did
not believe Hiett ''had anything to do with (Odom's) death, and I
am not taking that into account.''
</P>
<P>
   Hiett was ordered to surrender on Jan. 8, 2001. Once released
from prison, he will be under house arrest for five months as part
of a year's probation.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Laurie Hiett pleaded guilty to drug conspiracy
charges, admitting she shipped packages containing $700,000 worth
of heroin and cocaine. She is serving a five-year sentence.

<HEADLINE> Federal judge says Boy Scouts eligible for payroll deduction  </HEADLINE>
dtfons
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) - Bolstered by last month's U.S. Supreme
Court ruling that gives the Boy Scouts of America the right to ban
gay troop leaders, the group will once again be able solicit
charitable contributions from a state employee payroll program.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge ruled Thursday that the Boy Scouts must be
included on a list of state employee charity payroll deductions,
despite a state agency's determination that the groups' hiring
policies violated state discrimination laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Boys Scouts were dropped from the payroll program after the
Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities ruled in May that the
Scouts' hiring policies were discriminatory
</P>
<P>
   The Scouts appealed the ruling and also filed a federal
discrimination lawsuit against the state.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the lawsuit, U.S. District Court Judge Warren
Eginton said he will sign an order directing the Connecticut State
Employee Campaign Committee to return the Boy Scouts to the list
for the rest of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's decision comes about a month after the U.S. Supreme
Court ruled that the Boy Scouts have the right to ban gay leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was the right thing to do, especially in light of the
Supreme Court's recognition that the Boy Scouts have a first
amendment right to their membership policies,'' said Daniel L.
Schwartz, the lawyer who filed the lawsuit for the Boy Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Boy Scouts brought this action so that they could remain
in the state employee campaign, as they have participated in the
campaign for the last 30 years,'' Schwartz said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1999 campaign, $9,950 was contributed directly to the Boy
Scouts by state employees. The Scouts also received a portion of
$200,000 in non-designated contributions. The Scouts were line to
receive just over $10,000 this year, according to payroll campaign
documents.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who represents the
state in the lawsuit, was still reviewing the ruling Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have any comment,'' said Blumenthal. ''We're
reviewing the order and advising the CHRO and the state employee
campaign as to what it means.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the state employee campaign could not be reached
for comment. Phone calls seeking comment from Janice Gwudz,
director of the state employee campaign, were left on her office
voice mail.

<HEADLINE> Child critical after contracting E. coli during creek swim  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - A distraught mother and father's bedside
vigil neared the end of its second week Thursday as the source of
the E. coli bacteria that sickened their son continued to elude
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Seven-year-old Zachary See was in critical condition at
Children's Hospital in Buffalo, battling pneumonia as well as the
E. coli infection that shut down his kidneys, his grandmother, Sue
Richards, said.
</P>
<P>
   ''One day you can be running around playing,'' she said, ''and
the next day you're laying there dying.''
</P>
<P>
   Chautauqua County authorities believe the blonde, blue-eyed boy
contracted the bacteria while swimming in a creek in the Chautauqua
Gorge near the family's Westfield home, but they don't know how the
popular swimming hole became contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   E. coli is an intestinal bacteria often spread through animal or
human feces that gets into water supplies. It causes nausea,
diarrhea, cramps and in severe cases, kidney failure.
</P>
<P>
   There have been numerous instances where swimmers or bathers
contracted the illness. In August 1999, 37 people were sickened by
E. coli at Battle Ground Lake in Washington and several beaches
this year have been closed on Lake Erie and Lake Michigan because
of suspected E. coli contamination. At a Georgia water park in
1998, one girl died and dozens others were sickened by E. coli.
</P>
<P>
   In the Chautauqua County case, a wastewater treatment plant and
pumping station along the creek had been ruled out as sources,
Village Mayor Ron Catalano said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''(Crews) are out walking checking point sources to see if
there's been any kind of discharge,'' he said. Authorities are
investigating whether run-off from area farms may be to blame or
whether a beaver dam discovered in the creek could have played a
role.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just keep looking,'' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   David and Yvonne See, meanwhile, keep waiting for their son to
show signs of improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have not left his bedside for two weeks... I don't think
they've slept or eaten hardly at all,'' Richards said.
</P>
<P>
   Zachary was swimming with his 11-year-old brother during a
family outing at the creek July 1. Doctors believe he contracted
the bacteria through stitches he had received following recent
tooth surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Within a day, Zachary was suffering flu-like symptoms and was
hospitalized after blood tests revealed the E. coli.
</P>
<P>
   With hospital and household bills mounting, Richards said the
family is accepting donations at the Key Bank in Westfield. Her
son, David, is a car salesman. Yvonne See works as a cleaning
woman.
</P>
<P>
   ''They haven't been able to go to work. They have rent due,
utilities, car payments, car insurance,'' the grandmother said.
</P>
<P>
   Chautauqua County health officials advised swimmers to stick to
beaches where the water is regularly tested. Catalano acknowledged
it would be difficult to keep people from swimming in the gorge.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a beautiful place to go in the summertime,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani chastises Con Ed for voltage dim in city  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A short circuit in a power line caused lights to
flicker across the city and Westchester County on Thursday and led
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to again question Con Edison's ability to
adequately supply the region with electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The voltage dip - which affected all of the utility's 3 million
customers - is the latest in a series of electrical glitches in the
city, including a brownout earlier this month on the Upper East
Side of Manhattan and a 19-hour blackout in Washington Heights last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was having lunch at the time and I saw the lights dim,''
Giuliani told a press conference. ''I thought it was twice, but
others said it was three times - and then Con Edison called us
after that and explained they were having a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani added: ''I don't know why lights have to blink off and
on in New York City. It would seem to me that (Con Ed) would have
enough notice, enough information to be able to make certain that
we have enough power.''
</P>
<P>
   Con Edison spokeswoman Joy Faber said the voltage dip occurred
about noon and was caused by a short circuit in an overhead
transmission line in Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   It was an ''isolated problem,'' Faber said.

<HEADLINE> Future of Internet gambling bill murky  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Two key Republican lawmakers say a House bill
to outlaw online casinos will not inadvertently expand other
gambling on the Internet, but their assurances may not be enough to
gain passage.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics maintain the legislation would help some gambling
interests reach bettors through home computers, particularly horse
racing. Those critics, plus others who say the bill would unfairly
restrict state lotteries and unwisely regulate the Internet, could
scuttle a movement that appeared to be gaining momentum when the
Senate approved an Internet gambling bill last year.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill is designed to stop the growth of Web sites that
allow people to wager money on casino games through their home
computer, regardless of whether casinos are legal in their state. A
vote could come early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists for pari-mutuel betting - wagers placed on horse
racing, dog racing and jai alai - argued successfully for an
exemption to permit existing interstate activities like
simulcasting. The Justice Department opposed the exemptions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Simply stated, the department does not understand why the
pari-mutuel wagering industry should be allowed to accept bets from
people in their homes, when other forms of gambling have rightly
been prohibited from doing so,'' Deputy Assistant Attorney General
Kevin DiGregory told a House committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chris Cannon, R-Utah, called the bill ''a well-meaning
attempt to regulate a pernicious vice (that) will actually allow
gambling into America's homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to stem the criticism, two Republican congressmen
this week agreed on additional language to specify the bill is not
intended to permit activities that now are illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, sponsor of the legislation, and
Billy Tauzin of Louisiana, chairman of the House Commerce
subcommittee on telecommunications, hope their agreement clears the
way for passage.
</P>
<P>
   ''This compromise is a huge step toward preventing runaway
gambling on the Internet,'' said Tauzin, who got involved after a
Commerce Committee hearing in June exposed concerns about the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin's spokesman, Ken Johnson, said the compromise seeks to
avoid the controversy over the use of the Internet for betting on
horse races. ''There are growing indications that this dispute may
end up in court,'' he said, ''and we're not going to pick the
winners and losers.''
</P>
<P>
   The River City Group, a consulting group for the online gambling
industry, said in a recent report that gambling is offered by
nearly 700 Internet sites. The report projected Internet gambling
will grow from $1.1 billion in 1999 to $3 billion in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Most agree Internet gambling as commonly practiced is already
illegal under the 1961 Wire Communications Act, which was written
to cover sports betting over the telephone. They say the new bill
is necessary to leave no doubt that Internet gambling remains
illegal even when computers communicate by something other than
phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   The bill prohibits anyone who runs a gambling business to place
or receive a wager online. Enforcement would be challenging,
however, because most Internet gambling outlets are located outside
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics are loath to see any government regulation of the
Internet, while others are unhappy that an exemption allowing sales
of state lottery tickets over the Internet was removed by the House
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The bills are S. 692 and H.R. 3125.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Asks NAACP To Support Gore  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- In a sentimental farewell appearance to the
NAACP, President Clinton put Vice President Al Gore in league with
vice presidents who rose to the top office -- Thomas Jefferson,
Theodore Roosevelt, Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson -- but said
''never in the history of the country'' has any vice president done
as much as Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton broke away from the Camp David talks with the leaders of
Israel and the Palestinian Authority to address the civil rights
association's annual convention in his final appearance as
president.
</P>
<P>
   He won a loving embrace from an audience that also applauded
Gore but gave his opponent, George W. Bush, a muted response.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm really glad Governor Bush came -- I am,'' Clinton said.
''But I thought the other fellow gave a better speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Gore, who addressed the NAACP's annual convention here on
Wednesday, Clinton coupled Scripture -- Ecclesiaticus 11:25, ''In
the day of prosperity, there is forgetfulness of affliction'' --
with a political message. He argued that the nation's current
prosperity is a result of his policies, and insinuated that the
prosperity will dry up without Gore in the White House.
Ecclesiaticus is a part of the Old Testament which is not included
in all versions of the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called Gore the ''most influential and active vice
president'' in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had a lot of vice presidents, a lot of vice presidents
made great presidents -- Thomas Jefferson, Teddy Roosevelt, Harry
Truman, Lyndon Johnson,'' Clinton said. ''But we've never had a
vice president that did so much good as vice president as Al Gore --
never, not ever in the history of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the crowd of 3,000 shouted ''that's right,'' ''yeah''
and ''amen'' when they liked what Clinton said. They smiled and
applauded and gave him standing ovations, waving small American
flags and blue NAACP flags. When Clinton mentioned that his term
ends in January, they sighed ''Awwww!'' in unison.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Bush was met by polite applause, but his
opening remarks were delayed by shouts from the convention floor
from four anti-death penalty protesters. Bush greeted the skeptical
crowd by stating what many in the room were thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ''For my party, there's no escaping the reality that the party
of Lincoln has not always carried the mantle of Lincoln,'' Bush
said frankly. ''I'm not castigating. I'm talking reality. That's my
job, to say here's where we have fallen short and here's where we
will improve.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in his speech, scorned Bush's attempt to woo black voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know that you heard some nice-sounding words on Monday
afternoon,'' Gore said, pausing with a sarcastic scowl while
convention-goers hooted in approval. ''But I remembered what
scripture teaches in the book of James, Chapter 2, Verse 18: 'Yea,
a man may say thou has faith and I have works. Show me thy faith
without thy works and I will show thee my faith by my works.''
</P>
<P>
   Black voters historically have favored the Democratic
presidential candidate, although one convention goer, Harley Dixon
of New York City, said Gore still needs to capture the spirit
Clinton exudes around black people.
</P>
<P>
   ''People will come out (to vote) for Gore but it's not the
same,'' Dixon said. ''Clinton is the only white politician I know
who can talk across the color line without effort. Maybe the vice
president will learn to do that too.''
</P>
<P>
   Veronica Vicki Fickling, an NAACP member from Chicago, called
Gore's speech ''fantastic.'' ''It was like he really cared about
people,'' she said. She described Bush's speech as ''courteous.''
</P>
<P>
   During his speech, Clinton announced $5 million in funding for
diabetes research, and highlighted $300 million proposed in his
mid-session budget over five years for new research on diabetes
treatment and prevention.
</P>
<P>
   He pressed Congress to stop delaying his judicial nominees, many
of whom are minorities. The next president will be called on to
appoint two to four Supreme Court justices, several Court of
Appeals judges and possibly more than 100 federal district court
judges, Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Dutch KO Child Euthanasia Proposal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- The government withdrew a proposal
Thursday that would have allowed ill children as young as 12 to
decide whether to end their own lives without parental consent.
</P>
<P>
   The exclusion of the much-debated clause was likely to boost the
chances for passing a broader bill legalizing assisted suicide,
which is now accepted practice in Holland under certain guidelines
even though it is still technically outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   The Ministry of Justice said it had withdrawn the proposal to
offer ''physicians the possibility, in exceptional cases, of
allowing a request for euthanasia by a minor between 12 and 16
against the wishes of their parents.''
</P>
<P>
   The government of Prime Minister Wim Kok has wavered over the
issue, first proposing the measure and then withdrawing it more
than a year ago. The ministers of health and justice resubmitted
the proposal last week, in what some analysts viewed as a ploy to
win approval for other controversial provisions of the new
legislation, such as legalizing euthanasia for victims of
Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would legalize guidelines set by the government in 1993
under which doctors would not be prosecuted for assisting suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations, to be incorporated in the new law, place strict
conditions on euthanasia: the patient must be suffering
irremediable and unbearable pain, be aware of all other medical
options, and make voluntary and informed requests. Doctors aren't
allowed to suggest it as an option.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, 2,216 cases of euthanasia and assisted suicide were
recorded in the Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> Assembly passes school construction bill  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - All New Jersey schools will receive some
construction aid from the state under a multibillion dollar measure
passed Thursday by the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The 66-8 Assembly tally capped an ''extremely interesting
journey'' for the funding measure, as one lawmaker put it, and set
the stage for the state's largest public works program.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of Thursday's vote, schools across the state will
soon commence long-delayed projects to rebuild or replace crumbling
and overcrowded buildings, some more than a century old.
</P>
<P>
   The bill provides $6 billion for the state's 30 so-called
special needs districts and $2.6 billion for all other schools.
Counting interest, the program is expected to cost $15 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Projects in the poor schools will be funded at 100 percent, as
ordered by the state Supreme Court. Other schools will be
reimbursed at least 40 percent of the cost of projects.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman, who is expected to sign the bill within
10 days, said Thursday that most ground breakings probably won't
start until next summer because too much of the current
construction season has been lost. In its landmark 1998 ruling, the
court set a spring 2000 deadline for bill passage, but lawmakers
missed that by weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Work is already under way in 14 of the so-called special needs
districts for projects addressing health and safety concerns, the
governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said the measure is designed to help children in poor
and rich districts alike.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is about all children, in every district. It is about, for
the first time, having the state offer some financial support to
districts other than the (special needs) districts for capital
construction,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''And we know that there are classroom and school buildings
throughout the state that are in need of repair and renovation, so
I think it is only fair that we offer this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's bill was vastly different than the version first
introduced in the Assembly. Whitman changed it to appease members
of the Senate, who endorsed the amended version last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''This bill had an extremely interesting journey,'' said its
sponsor, Assemblyman Joseph Malone, R-Burlington.
</P>
<P>
   Some Assembly Republicans had balked at backing the bill after
Whitman stripped legislative veto power from it.
</P>
<P>
   But Collins said his promise Thursday to introduce a separate
bill creating a special legislative review panel helped change
enough minds to create a comfortable winning margin for the school
construction bill.
</P>
<P>
   However, the bill almost didn't win Collins backing.
</P>
<P>
   In a spirited speech from the floor of the Assembly, the speaker
admitted that he considered voting against it as a symbolic way to
register his displeasure with the court order.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the Supreme Court way overstretched,'' he said later.
''We don't need the court stepping in and being the Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   But Assemblyman Wilfredo Caraballo, D-Essex, argued that the
balance in power among the branches of government has not been
upended.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is exactly what the Founding Fathers had in mind: The
judicial branch has brought in a recalcitrant executive branch and
legislative branch and told them you've go to do the right thing,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Leonard Lance, R-Hunterdon, had other reservations.
He said he would rather the state adopt a pay-as-you-go approach on
school construction, thereby saving interest costs. If lawmakers
still insisted on borrowing the money, Lance said they ought to
first seek permission from the voters.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawmakers said they supported a flawed bill.
</P>
<P>
   For example, some complained the state's construction cost
allowance of $138 per square foot is too low for expensive northern
New Jersey cities.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not the perfect bill. It's not necessarily the best
bill. But it's the only bill before us,'' said Assembly Democratic
Leader Joseph V. Doria, D-Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   ''We find ourselves in a situation where the health, safety and
welfare of children is in jeopardy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also said they want to keep close tabs on the state
Economic Development Authority, the state agency charged with
managing the massive project for all the special needs districts,
plus all other districts that receive 55 percent or more of state
aid.
</P>
<P>
   David Sciarra, director of the Education Law Center, which sued
the state on behalf of poor school children, agreed that lawmakers
must follow through to ensure that the EDA and Department of
Education perform their new tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was the easy part, now the hard work begins,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Collins joked that as lawmakers were congratulating themselves,
one person, Education Commissioner David Hespe, may have spent
Thursday worrying about his new responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''One person who has to be nervous today is poor David Hespe,''
Collins said.

<HEADLINE> Jets have everyone on hand for training camp  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY WILNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Al Groh's busy offseason is over. Now, the tough
part begins: coaching the New York Jets for real.
</P>
<P>
   Groh succeeds Bill Parcells, who merely took one of the NFL's
perennial underachievers and turned it into a contender. He doesn't
have defensive coordinator Bill Belichick on hand, either, and star
receiver Keyshawn Johnson now plays for Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   So as training camp begins Friday, is Groh ready?
</P>
<P>
   ''We've lost a legend, a genius and a star,'' Groh said, a
twinkle in his eye, a smile on his face and his tongue planted
firmly in his cheek. ''I don't know if we have a very good
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Groh is highly optimistic about the Jets, who come off
an 8-8 season in which they won their final four games and seven of
the last nine. They get back quarterback Vinny Testaverde, who
missed all but the first half of the 1999 season opener. They have
a star running back in Curtis Martin, a good, young offensive line
and some versatility at linebacker and in the secondary. Their
kicking games are solid.
</P>
<P>
   But there also are the holes, huge holes. No one was added to
the lineup who remotely resembles Johnson in the area of making big
plays at receiver. The new pass rushers are rookies - the top two
of an unprecedented four first-round draft picks were defensive end
Shaun Ellis and linebacker John Abraham.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end was a wasteland last year, and the likely starter also
is a rookie, first-rounder Anthony Becht.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not as if we're starting from scratch,'' Groh said. ''I
have high expectations of what we can accomplish in phases. It's a
cumulative and incremental thing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a clear picture of how I want the team to look, how it
plays, the manner of how it behaves. I want that collective mindset
that on the first weekend in September, we have the most team we
can have.''
</P>
<P>
   Groh has emphasized throughout the offseason training program
and in minicamps that he is not a Parcells clone. He understands he
has to establish himself as a head coach in the NFL; his only
previous experience in the job was at Wake Forest for six years in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ''That will be a part of it, I'm sure,'' Groh said. ''I'll coach
the team by being me and go from that point forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the challenges of his first training camp as head coach
will be finding kick returners after injured Leon Johnson was
released; establishing a deep passing game that will help the Jets
be more efficient inside the 20; and remaining aggressive on
defense.
</P>
<P>
   He believes all of those issues will be solved.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think all teams that are starting at this point have
expectations rather than confidence,'' Groh said. ''No one has
demonstrated performance at this point and confidence grows from
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Confidence is one of the most tenuous things in sports. It
comes and goes based on what players see happening on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Jets won't see on the field are, to use Groh's
sarcastic words, a legend, a genius and a star. That's a lot to
overcome.

<HEADLINE> Former students accuse New Jersey rabbi of abuse over 20 years  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - For 30 years, Rabbi Baruch Lanner was known
in the Orthodox Jewish community as a charismatic, dynamic
educator, a founding principal of a yeshiva school in New Jersey
and guide on countless retreats.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues and students say Lanner would call parents to
persuade them to let their children travel to Israel with him,
board students at his Paramus home so they could attend yeshiva,
and inspire them to become better Jews. Some saw him as a
substitute father.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months, more than 25 former students have come
forward to say that for decades Lanner, a leader in the Orthodox
Union's National Conference of Synagogue Youth, also sexually,
physically and verbally abused them.
</P>
<P>
   The students, now in their 30s and 40s, said that Lanner kissed,
fondled and hit teen-age girls and kneed some boys in the groin.
His accusers also say he attacked a man with a knife.
</P>
<P>
   Lanner, 50, resigned as director of regions for the New
York-based youth group last month after The Jewish Week, a leading
Jewish weekly, published many of the allegations. Two New Jersey
prosecutors have begun criminal investigations and Lanner's
ex-employer, the Orthodox Union, has begun a probe to determine
whether it was responsible for covering up complaints about Lanner.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Yosef Blau, a Yeshiva University counselor and one of
Lanner's strongest critics, said the rabbi was largely protected by
the Orthodox Union, a venerable institution with a membership of
nearly 1,000 synagogues that also puts the seal of approval on
kosher food.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that they were so enamored with his success and
accomplishments that they didn't want to hear problems,'' Blau
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a code of loyalty here at the same time, and also he
was very scary,'' said Naomi Freistat, a 41-year-old doctor who
said that Lanner kissed and fondled her a dozen times and punched
her in the stomach when she was 15. ''This was a man where you
didn't know what was coming next.''
</P>
<P>
   Lanner lived in Paramus until separating recently from his wife
and now takes calls from a number in Fair Lawn. He said he has
violated Orthodox Jewish law in the past by having physical
relationships with former students - none teen-agers - but hasn't
broken any other laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did many things I shouldn't have done, but none of them were
illegal. None of them were perverted. None of them were
threatening,'' Lanner said.
</P>
<P>
   He denied most allegations printed in The Jewish Week and said
he couldn't recall others. He admitted accidentally kneeing a boy
in the groin in 1983 at the Monmouth County yeshiva he founded.
</P>
<P>
   He has never faced criminal charges, although a religious
tribunal was called in 1989 to investigate whether he had knifed a
Bergen County man suffering from cancer in an argument over who the
man should marry. Lanner was cleared.
</P>
<P>
   Bergen County prosecutors are investigating allegations in the
June 23 article, said First Assistant Prosecutor Fred Schwanwede.
</P>
<P>
   One woman, Marcie Lenk of Fort Lee, said that Lanner would make
frequent comments about her breast size and suggestively brush up
against her while she was a student in the early 1980s at the
Frisch School in Paramus.
</P>
<P>
   Lanner, who taught Talmud at the school, would say ''ooh, that
felt good,'' after brushing past her, Lenk, 34, told The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   Lanner said Lenk misinterpreted his actions. He said she stayed
at his home frequently and never spoke to him about feeling
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you felt threatened, idiot, why did you come?'' Lanner
said. ''Why did your parents let you come?''
</P>
<P>
   Lenk, who was 15 when she first came to the school, said she
stayed at Lanner's home about three times over three years. She
said Lanner manipulated many of his students into keeping quiet by
making them feel inferior. ''He made us believe that we needed
him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Monmouth County Prosecutor John Kaye is investigating the
complaint of a woman who said she was Lanner's student at the
Hillel school in Deal, which Lanner founded and was principal of
until 1997. Kaye said the woman came to Westfield police on Monday,
but wouldn't identify her or describe her complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The author of The Jewish Week article, editor and publisher Gary
Rosenblatt, said he spoke to between 15 and 18 people who
complained about Lanner for the article, and has received letters
from a dozen more since it was published.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of them didn't know there were any others,'' Rosenblatt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Freistat, a podiatrist in New York, told the AP that she met
Lanner when she traveled from Wilkes-Barre, Pa., to retreats in New
Jersey. Freistat said Lanner persuaded her mother to let her go on
his six-week trip to Israel in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Lanner asked Freistat to kiss him on the cheek the first week of
the trip, and on the second week summoned her outside - ''it was
always outside,'' she said - and kissed and fondled her. She
endured the contact a dozen times, she said, fearing that the youth
group leader would send her home.
</P>
<P>
   She said she tried to pull away the last time he approached her
in a Jerusalem courtyard near her hostel, and Lanner grabbed her.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said 'Don't walk away from me,''' Freistat said. ''He
punched me in the stomach. All I remember is just looking up at him
and saying 'You just punched the wrong girl.'''
</P>
<P>
   Freistat said she and another girl on the youth group spoke to
two rabbis, one who was helping lead the youth group tour, about
Lanner but the rabbi went unpunished. The Orthodox Union set up a
commission in June to find out ''who knew what and when did they
know it,'' said president Mandell I. Ganchrow.
</P>
<P>
   Freistat called the Union ''a boys' club,'' while other students
said that the organization let Lanner's conduct go unchecked
because he made a lot of money for it. Others said they were too
intimidated to speak out.
</P>
<P>
   Said Freistat: ''He was smart enough to pick on little kids.''

<HEADLINE> Chicken of the Sea settles trademark infringement case  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) - Ask any trademark lawyer you happen to
see: Is the Mermaid Seafood company's mermaid too much like the
famous mermaid from ''Chicken of the Sea''?
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the two companies reached a settlement late
Thursday after fighting out a trademark infringement claim in
federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the settlement were not released.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over the two mermaids began in 1996 when lawyers for
Chicken of the Sea wrote to Mermaid Seafood and asked the company
to stop picturing or using the word ''mermaid'' in their name. The
Greenwich-based import-export company, which sells frozen cod,
salmon and haddock to wholesalers, began using a blue silhouette of
a mermaid on its packaging in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Chicken of the Sea has used its familiar smiling blonde mermaid
on its cans since 1952. The company's well-known jingle, ''Ask any
mermaid you happen to see, what's the best tuna? Chicken of the
Sea'' has been around since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Mermaid Seafood, however, said they had a right
to use their own mermaid. The company responded to Chicken of the
Sea's cease-and-desist letter by filing a federal lawsuit in
November 1996, asking the court to affirm its right to advertise,
sell and distribute frozen fish under its trademark and logo.
</P>
<P>
   The company also asked the court to stop Chicken of the Sea from
using a mermaid on its frozen seafood.
</P>
<P>
   But Chicken of the Sea filed a countersuit, calling its mermaid
trademark ''one of the most important and valuable assets'' of the
company.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Alan Nevas began hearing
testimony on the issue of ''likelihood of confusion'' involving the
two companies' use of the two mermaids.
</P>
<P>
   But after two days of testimony, the two sides spent all day
Thursday negotiating behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   They emerged from the meetings at 6:30 p.m. and announced they
had reached a settlement. Citing a confidentiality agreement,
neither side would reveal any details, such as whether one company
is restrained from using the mermaid logo in any way or whether
there were monetary damages.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's settled. It's all confidential. We're all happy it's
over,'' said Susan Hollander, an attorney representing San
Diego-based Chicken of the Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Mussell, president and chief executive of Chicken of the
Sea, attended the trial, but would not comment on the settlement.

<HEADLINE> New approach to AIDS drugs shows promise in early testing  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) - An entirely new class of AIDS drugs
on the horizon may offer just-in-time help to many patients whose
treatment options are running out, researchers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The latest data suggest these drugs may dramatically restore
health - at least temporarily - to people dying because the virus
has grown resistant to all the currently available AIDS medicines.
</P>
<P>
   The new drugs block HIV in a different way from the standard
medicines that have revolutionized AIDS treatment in recent years.
Instead of gumming up the virus's ability to manufacture new copies
of itself, they block the virus from getting inside blood cells.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs are called entry inhibitors and are being developed by
many companies, although only one has entered broad human testing.
</P>
<P>
   ''They hold significant promise for the treatment of HIV,'' said
Dr. Joseph Eron of the University of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors discussed the drugs at the 13th International AIDS
Conference, where the latest data were presented on Trimeris,
Inc.'s experimental T-20, the most advanced medicine in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Combinations of drugs introduced about five years ago turned
AIDS from a death sentence to a treatable disease, at least in
parts of the world where people can afford the medicines. These
combinations can drive the virus below detectable levels, but in
about half of patients, the virus returns within a year.
</P>
<P>
   When this happens, doctors switch their patients to different
combinations of the 14 available drugs. However, the virus usually
returns even more quickly with each new drug cocktail.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these people remain outwardly well, despite their virus
levels. But no one knows how long this will last, and doctors worry
they will be left with nothing to fight the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''We desperately need new targets for tackling HIV,'' said Dr.
Julio Montaner of the University of British Columbia. ''We think
these people will need help in the not too distant future.''
</P>
<P>
   The current drugs fit into three major classes. But all work by
blocking the virus's ability to make new copies of itself once it
infects a cell. The new drugs instead are designed to stop the
virus from penetrating cells to start this process.
</P>
<P>
   When the new drugs are used alone, the virus appears to quickly
grow resistant to them, just as it does with other medicines. So
doctors envision combining these so-called entry inhibitors with
the standard medicines to keep a step ahead of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   ''Drugs that work on the outside of the cell would be a
tremendous addition to the drugs that work on the inside,'' said
Dr. David Ho of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Cal Cohen of the Community Research Initiative of New
England presented data on 71 patients who took T-20 after failing
with all the standard drugs. Fourteen did not get better, and 16
others dropped out of the study for a variety of personal reasons.
But after one year, 41 are still in the study and responding well
to the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Their average virus levels were 100,000 copies per milliliter of
blood before treatment and 3,000 copies now.
</P>
<P>
   Among the patients was a dying man, blind in one eye from an
AIDS-related infection, whose HIV-ravaged white blood cells had
dropped to a precipitous 33 copies per cubic millimeter of blood.
After a year on T-20 and four standard AIDS drugs, his blood cells
have risen to 430 copies, and his virus level is barely detectable.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now he is even healthier looking than I am,'' Cohen said.
''He's back to life. You control the virus, and good things
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The drug's major drawback is that it must be injected twice a
day, but Cohen said patients seemed able to do this without
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Fusion inhibitors, plus new versions of standard drugs, ''may be
exactly what people need,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Trimeris is designing large, final-stage testing of T-20.
Officials say this will involve people at earlier stages of
infection.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, scientists have worked out the mechanics of the
devilishly sophisticated process by which the virus gets into its
targets. T-20 works by blocking one step in the fusion of the virus
to cells, and other drugs interrupt at other points.
</P>
<P>
   Another of these entry-blocking drugs, developed by Madison,
N.J.-based Schering Plough, begins first-stage human testing this
month in the United States.

<HEADLINE> State changes course again on Hamilton building site  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman has found a new use
for a suburban Trenton site she abandoned for a state office
building.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of relocating the state Division of Revenue to the
Hamilton Township site, the governor announced Thursday that the
State Police will use the location to house its new Troop C
headquarters and communications center.
</P>
<P>
   The state will lose less than $1 million for changing course on
the project.
</P>
<P>
   The governor in April decided to maintain Division of Revenue
offices in Trenton instead of relocating them to Hamilton as first
planned. She did so to stem the loss of 500 jobs from Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, state officials estimated they had invested $3
million in the building site they were abandoning.
</P>
<P>
   More than $2 million worth of those site improvements can be
reused to house the State Police facility, state officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly members Gary Guear and Linda Greenstein, Democrats who
both represent the district that includes Hamilton, applauded the
news.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today's reversal by the governor corrects a wrong that should
never have been made,'' said Greenstein.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Mideast Reconciliation  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. (AP) -- With a self-imposed deadline exactly two
months away, President Clinton urged Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to set aside their
differences and reconcile for the good of their people.
</P>
<P>
   ''Former adversaries can come together to find common ground in
a way that benefits all their people, to let go of the past and
embrace the future, to forgive and to reconcile,'' Clinton said in
Washington before returning to oversee the slow-moving peace talks.
He planned to remain overnight.
</P>
<P>
   But as the third day of the summit drew to a close, spokesman
Richard Boucher said ''we are not trying to characterize optimism
or pessimism'' as the two sides deal with what he called ''very
tough issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating the signing of a trade agreement with Vietnam, with
which the United States was at war three decades ago, Clinton saw a
message for Barak and Arafat, who held their first face-to-face
meeting Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will take the energy I feel here from all these people back
to Camp David and make the argument that they should follow suit,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat met for about an hour in Arafat's Birch cabin
at Camp David, which the late Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin
occupied 22 years ago in negotiating peace terms with Egypt's Anwar
Sadat.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatic sources said the talks were serious but did not
produce a breakthrough on any of the core issues.
</P>
<P>
   These include the future of Jerusalem, the fate of Jewish
settlements in the West Bank and in Gaza, and whether more than 2
million Palestinian refugees will be given the right to return to
homes in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Barak signaled before the summit that he would agree to a
Palestinian foothold in predominantly Arab neighborhoods of
Jerusalem, would roll up most of the settlements and accept
thousands of Palestinians who have families living in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Arafat has given no indication publicly that his
demands for virtually all of the West Bank and a state with its
capital in Jerusalem are negotiable.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dan Meridor, chairman of the committee in Israel's
parliament that deals with military and foreign affairs, joined
ISrael's delegation.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have said Arafat wants to hold a ''leadership
meeting'' that would include three senior PLO officials who are in
the Washington area. U.S. spokesmen say they are not aware of any
request to allow the three to enter Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said there had been no request made of the U.S. hosts
but that both sides were permitted to bring in a ''limited number
of people for a limited period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ''I'm not trying to open the door very wide.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has expressed hope for an agreement before his
scheduled departure for Japan for an economic summit meeting in
less than a week, turned the reins over to Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright for most of Thursday. She met with senior
members of the Israeli and Palestinian delegations.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting had been expected with Arafat but there was no
explanation why Albright did not see the Palestinian leader. ''We
are doing what we think best to move the process forward,'' Boucher
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, addressing the NAACP convention in Baltimore, said he
hoped the summit would ''resolve the profound differences that have
kept the people of the Middle East apart for a very long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Invoking the memory of the late civil rights crusader Martin
Luther King Jr., Clinton told NAACP delegates, ''I know that in our
quest for a full, fair and final peace -- which Dr. King reminded us
is more than the absence of war but the presence of justice and
brotherhood and genuine reconciliation -- I know we will have your
prayers and your best wishes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because you embody the spirit of freedom and reconciliation
we're trying to capture there, that we need so badly in our
talks,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House adhered to its refusal to discuss the substance
of the peace talks. And Boucher, who filled in for presidential
spokesman Joe Lockhart, followed the instruction.
</P>
<P>
   ''Welcome to the daily press blackout,'' he told reporters at
the outset.
</P>
<P>
   And that was about all he had to say.

<HEADLINE> Democrat seeks Senate primary against Clinton  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Mark S.
McMahon filed more than 40,000 petition signatures with the state
Board of Elections Thursday, potentially forcing a primary against
Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The signatures must be verified by the board of elections before
placing the Manhattan doctor's name on a Sept. 12 primary ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Under state election rules, the signatures must be from party
members with at least 100 of them coming from 16 of the state's 31
congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican candidate is U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon, 39, has said he and Clinton seem to agree on most
significant issues, but he would be a stronger advocate for Israel
and better access to health care. He is pro-choice, but opposed to
late-term abortions unless the mother's life is in danger.

<HEADLINE> Prudential, MetLife respond to lawsuits accusing them of discrimination </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Prudential Insurance Co. of America and MetLife
Inc. on Thursday defended themselves against allegations of racial
discrimination in the sale of insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to lawsuits, Prudential acknowledged that it had used
race-based underwriting in the distant past, and announced it is
establishing a toll-free telephone number for policyholders who may
have paid race-based premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Foley, a spokesman for the Manhattan-based Metropolitan
Life Insurance Co., said a lawsuit filed Tuesday in U.S. District
Court in New York was a ''very inaccurate and unjustified portrait
of our company.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit accused Met Life of charging black customers higher
premiums for less insurance coverage than it charged whites. It
also alleged that in 1920, the firm urged the construction of
mortality tables that would factor in race.
</P>
<P>
   It said Met Life, which calls itself the leading seller of life
insurance in the nation, began targeting mostly poor, black
customers eight decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Foley said the company doesn't engage in race-based
underwriting.
</P>
<P>
   ''No group of policyholders, including African Americans, have
suffered economic loss from doing business with our company,''
Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   A similar lawsuit was filed against Prudential in U.S. District
Court in Newark, N.J. Both lawsuits seek unspecified damages.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential issued a statement acknowledging it used race-based
underwriting in the past, but stopped in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ''While the practice of race-based underwriting is clearly
unacceptable by today's standards, Prudential acted in accordance
with what were then industry standard and generally accepted
actuarial and underwriting practices based on life expectancy,''
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob DeFillippo, a spokesman for the Newark-based company, said,
''The fact that race-based underwriting was used in the sale of
life insurance is very difficult for us to understand and
completely unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said some of the allegations against his company were
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits were brought by a group of law firms previously
involved in suing seven insurers who sold ''burial insurance''
policies to blacks clients mainly in the South.
</P>
<P>
   One of those companies, Houston-based American General Corp.,
agreed last month to pay more than $206 million to settle
allegations that black customers were charged higher premiums on
millions of policies.
</P>
<P>
   Barry A. Weprin, one of the lawyers who worked on the lawsuits,
laughed when he was told DeFillippo said establishing a toll-free
telephone number for ratepayers once subject to race-based premiums
was unrelated to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know how to respond to that. They didn't say it under
oath, I assume,'' Weprin said.
</P>
<P>
   DeFillippo said the toll-free telephone number was set up
because of increased public attention in general, including the
American General settlement, and because the Florida state
insurance department had made inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Eds: Prudential set up the following telephone number for anyone
who believes they might have paid race-based premiums for policies
purchased in the distant past: 1-800-201-7189.

<HEADLINE> Testimony in White House E-mail Case  </HEADLINE>
By GREG TOPPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A White House computer consultant told a
federal judge Thursday that technicians have begun retrieving the
first of thousands of lost e-mails, which are the subject of a
civil lawsuit against the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''Copying is now under way,'' testified Terrence Misich, an Army
chief warrant officer who is overseeing the project. He said a
searchable database of the e-mails should be ready in four weeks to
six weeks and blamed earlier delays on poor copier systems.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth, who is presiding over the
case brought by the conservative legal group Judicial Watch,
scheduled more pretrial testimony Friday in a hearing aimed at
finding the best way to get the messages to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony Thursday, two former White House computer
consultants said workers could have retrieved the lost e-mails in a
matter of months if the White House had committed enough resources.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials earlier this year said thousands of
e-mails, including some from Vice President Al Gore's office, were
not properly archived and were lost because of a computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the messages were never reviewed by White House
lawyers to determine if they should be turned over to investigators
under subpoena in cases ranging from the Monica Lewinsky scandal
and Whitewater to campaign fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Misich said that despite months of work, technicians could not
reliably retrieve the e-mails until now because they could not find
the proper equipment to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Former White House computer worker Sheryl Hall, testifying
earlier on Judicial Watch's behalf, estimated it would take four
months to six months for about five workers to restore the
thousands of lost e-mails. She said workers could have begun
producing the files in a matter of days, given the proper tools.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Lambuth, a second former computer consultant, testified
that the job would take as long as four months.
</P>
<P>
   Because of an apparent programming error, incoming e-mail
messages dating back to August 1996 were not searched in response
to subpoenas by the Justice Department and congressional
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, Independent Counsel Robert Ray and the Justice
Department are investigating whether the e-mail problem was an
innocent mistake, as the White House contends, or part of an effort
to obstruct their investigations into the Lewinsky scandal and the
White House's gathering of the FBI files of past Republican
appointees.
</P>
<P>
   The White House denies any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans say the White House has dragged its feet in
solving the problem and threatened technicians who revealed the
glitch.
</P>
<P>
   Judicial Watch attorney Larry Klayman, who argued the case, told
Lamberth that the White House may have intentionally hired
consultants with little expertise in restoring the data in order to
delay the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The court hearing took place as Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., urged
White House counsel Beth Nolan and Attorney General Janet Reno to
support appointment of an outside expert to supervise the e-mail
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said the House Government Reform Committee, which he
heads, ''has no confidence that the White House will satisfy its
obligations to produce information in a timely fashion.''

<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Thousands of travelers were
stranded in the capital Thursday as a strike by bus Buenos Aires
drivers angry over a rash for dismissals stretched into a second
day.
</P>
<P>
   Travel was thwarted for some 40,000 people bound for Argentina's
interior and neighboring Paraguay and Bolivia, said Angel Giminez,
a Retiro bus station official in downtown Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   A response to recent staff dismissals, the drivers launched the
strike after a local bus company announced some 400 workers were
being laid off, forcing hundreds of passengers to sleep upright in
chairs or sprawled on the floor Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The government called for an ''obligatory conciliation'' between
the company, La International, and the bus drivers union.
</P>

<HEADLINE> SEC Employees Vote To Join Union  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Employees of the Securities and Exchange
Commission voted by a nearly 3-1 margin Thursday to join the
National Treasury Employees Union.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, monitored by representatives of the Federal Labor
Relations Authority, was 968 for joining the NTEU and 373 against.
The union, which represents about 155,000 workers in 26 federal
agencies, is expected to become the SEC employees' official
representative to negotiate with management.
</P>
<P>
   The vote has been opposed for months by SEC officials, who
wanted employees at the Washington headquarters to be represented
by a separate bargaining unit from those in the agency's regional
offices around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute delayed a vote first scheduled for last September by
SEC employees on joining the NTEU. The Labor Relations Authority
ruled against the SEC in January. The SEC appealed the ruling; its
appeal was rejected this spring.
</P>
<P>
   SEC spokesmen had no immediate comment on the results announced
Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 885 votes cast by the agency's professional employees,
mainly attorneys and accountants, 452 were in favor of joining the
same bargaining unit as their non-professional colleagues and 410
were for a separate unit, union officials said. That means there
will be one bargaining unit for all employees, they said.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 1,200 professional employees at the SEC; about
650 employees in other job categories were eligible to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Some employees have complained that they are expected to work
uncompensated extra hours, known as ''donated'' time, and that
bonus money is seldom given to career employees.
</P>
<P>
   The NTEU represents employees at the Internal Revenue Service,
the U.S. Customs Service, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and
the Food and Drug Administration, among others.

<HEADLINE> Russian Military Argues Over Nukes  </HEADLINE>
By ANNA DOLGOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- A proposed reform of Russia's nuclear forces has
exploded into a major conflict among the military's top brass,
causing what the Russian media described Thursday as an
unprecedented ''coup attempt'' against Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev.
</P>
<P>
   A former chief of Russia's Strategic Missile Forces, Sergeyev
insists Russia must develop its nuclear weapons to deter potential
aggressors, at a time when its conventional forces are in disarray.
</P>
<P>
   But as Russia's offensive against rebels in Chechnya drags on,
commanders of conventional forces are demanding more money for
tanks and artillery, and some suggest that nuclear weapons programs
are taking up too much of the military funding.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict blew up on Wednesday, when the military's top brass
gathered to discuss how to restructure the armed forces to preserve
their combat capability in the face of severe financial shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev was advocating his longtime plan to beef up Russia's
Strategic Missile Forces, making them the core of a new deterrent
force into which the nuclear capabilities of the Navy and the Air
Force would be incorporated.
</P>
<P>
   But Anatoly Kvashnin, the chief of the General Staff, came out
against Sergeyev, addressing the meeting with his own reform plan
that envisages significant cuts in the Strategic Missile Forces and
calls for incorporating them into the Air Force -- significantly
reducing their status.
</P>
<P>
   Kvashnin also proposed boosting the number of conventional units
that Russia can deploy in the turbulent southwest, where Chechnya
is located, and in Central Asia, where Russia is trying to fight a
growing drug trade from Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the first time in the history of the Russian army, the
General Staff chief openly went against the defense minister,'' the
daily Kommersant said Thursday. ''What happened ... can only be
described as a coup attempt in the military,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   The daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta called Kvashnin's expression of
dissent ''an unprecedented step.''
</P>
<P>
   Independent military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer said Thursday
that the military had hoped for increased funding when President
Vladimir Putin came to power earlier this year, but had seen its
hopes dashed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the start of a very serious ... crisis within the
armed forces, and between the armed forces and the government,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gen. Leonid Ivashov, chief of the Defense Ministry's
international cooperation department, played down the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ''When a reform of the armed forces is under way, there are
always a lot of discussions,'' Ivashov told reporters Thursday.
''It's a normal procedure.''

<HEADLINE> Food company accused of rigging bids for food to NYC hospitals and jails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A Queens food company has been accused of
rigging bids for $2.4 million in food contracts to city hospitals
and jails, the Department of Justice announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Jitney Limited, a supplier of food and related products in the
Ozone Park section, was accused of conspiring with other suppliers
to rig bids on food contracts awarded by the city, the Newark
Public Schools and the Nassau County Department of General
Services.
</P>
<P>
   It was also accused of conspiracy to defraud the New York State
Office of General Services by overcharging the agency for food and
submitting fraudulent cost data.
</P>
<P>
   The charges filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan were the
latest to arise out of a federal investigation into bid rigging,
bribery, fraud and tax-related offenses in the food distribution
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, 22 individuals and 13 food companies were charged
with rigging bids for the supply and delivery of more than $210
million to the New York City Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   A message left with the company was not immediately returned.

<HEADLINE> Report: Torricelli works phones to pave way for possible Statehouse bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Democratic U.S. Sen. Robert Torricelli is
paving the way for a possible run for New Jersey governor by making
early contacts with party leaders in various counties, according to
The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   The Times reported Thursday that Torricelli, D-N.J., has been
calling county and state party leaders and asking them their views
on his possible candidacy, and requesting they delay any promise to
back Woodbridge Mayor Jim McGreevey.
</P>
<P>
   One Democrat whom The Times did not identify said Torricelli has
been ''burning up the phones.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been reported in recent weeks that state party officials
have been calling Torricelli or encouraging him to run, but The
Times report is the first indication Torricelli is taking the
prospect seriously and doing something about it on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli spokeswoman Kristin Carvell said Torricelli was
unavailable for an interview Thursday and that his office had no
comment on The Times report.
</P>
<P>
   After winning a tough three-way primary in 1997, McGreevey
surprised New Jersey by giving Whitman a tough re-election fight,
losing by less than 28,000 votes. He was immediately seen as the
leading candidate for the Democratic nomination in 2001, although
one of his competitors in the 1997 primary, former Morris County
Prosecutor Michael Murphy, is expected to seek a primary rematch
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli had been a McGreevey ally and booster. Both were
closely but unofficially affiliated with Jon Corzine, the
high-spending winner of the June 6 Democratic primary for U.S.
Senate over former Gov. Jim Florio.
</P>
<P>
   But party officials remain worried about a rift between southern
and northern New Jersey Democrats that was exacerbated by the
Florio-Corzine fight and which would damage Democratic hopes of
recapturing the Statehouse when Whitman leaves. The Times reported
that some party officials are questioning whether McGreevey is up
to the job of reuniting north and south, suggesting Torricelli
would be a stronger candidate based in no small measure on his
lopsided U.S. Senate victory in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many leaders believe he would be the best candidate to run for
governor who could unite the party and heal its divisions, and to
avoid a divisive primary in the gubernatorial race,'' former
Torricelli chief of staff Jamie Fox told the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> GOP Eyes Budget Deal With Clinton  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans said Thursday they
want to reach a quick compromise with President Clinton on the
year's biggest spending bill. The hope is to avoid a
campaign-season showdown over schools and other popular issues.
</P>
<P>
   In a closed-door meeting, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.,
and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told the chairmen
of the two chambers' appropriations committees to try striking a
deal with the White House next week, participants said. The
measure, which exceeds $340 billion, covers the Departments of
Education, Labor, and Health and Human Services for next year.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is perennially one of the last of the 13 spending bills
completed -- usually after the Oct. 1 start of the new fiscal year --
because it is a battlefield over education, workplace safety and
other highly politicized, difficult issues. Republicans are eager
to get those fights resolved before they can become a focus of the
November presidential and congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla. said
the instructions the leadership gave were ''to try to get what
would be a signable bill.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If we can get this bill to the president before the politics
starts, we'll have a working relationship'' with the White House
that could speed completion of the other spending bills, said his
Senate counterpart, Ted Stevens, R-Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Clinton has signed just one of the 13 spending bills for
fiscal 2001 into law.
</P>
<P>
   White House budget office spokeswoman Linda Ricci said
administration officials were ''always happy'' to meet with
lawmakers, but signaled that reaching a deal could be tough.
</P>
<P>
   Ricci said Clinton's ''key priorities'' for hiring teachers,
refurbishing schools and other issues would have to be met. She
also said Clinton wanted no policy changes that he opposes in the
bill and would want to ensure that the bill leaves enough money for
his proposals in later measures.
</P>
<P>
   ''Based on what we've seen to date, there's a long road to
travel,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has threatened to veto both the House- and Senate-passed
versions of the bill because of cuts in his proposals for teachers,
school repairs and social services grants to states. The bills
would also block planned administration regulations aimed at
reducing workplace injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats were jubilant when the GOP pushed the bill
through the House last month, saying its cuts would help Democrats
capture control of a chamber Republicans now govern with an 11-seat
majority. Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., top Democrat on the House
appropriations panel, said Thursday that even a quick deal with
Clinton on the bill would not change that.
</P>
<P>
   ''The politics has already been defined,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, House-Senate bargainers reached agreement on a
roughly $289 billion defense bill for 2001, about $20 billion more
than this year.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, about $4 billion higher than what Clinton proposed,
contains money for a 3.7 percent pay raise for military personnel.
It also has about $100 billion for procurement and for research and
development, Stevens said, amid complaints by Clinton that
lawmakers have added money for items the administration did not
request.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to House and Senate leaders, White House budget
chief Jack Lew said the administration ''opposes'' the defense
bill, but did not use the word ''veto.''

<HEADLINE> Peru Enacts Sweeping Phone Tap Law  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- A new law gives President Alberto Fujimori's
government sweeping powers to monitor private telephone calls,
Peru's largest telephone provider and opposition leaders charged
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, approved late Wednesday, gives Peru's
telecommunications watchdog agency, Osiptel much broader powers to
keep tabs on who's talking.
</P>
<P>
   ''From now on, the state, through Osiptel, can know who called,
with whom they spoke, when they spoke and from where they spoke,''
said Jorge Melo Vega, general manager of Regulations and Strategic
Planning for Telefonica del Peru.
</P>
<P>
   Melo Vega said Osiptel can now tap into confidential information
and company trade secrets, gaining access to data bases, software
and public phone records without a court order.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not only violating the rights of our company, but of
the entire sector,'' he told Radioprogramas del Peru.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation represents one of at least a dozen bills crafted
from ''urgent'' presidential decrees that Fujimori is trying to
push through Congress in its final session before he loses a clear
majority at the end of the month. The law does not give the
government free reign to eavesdrop on live telephone
communications.
</P>
<P>
   The measure comes amid growing accusations that he is
backpedaling on promises to fortify Peru's democracy and is
tightening his grip on power after his contentious May 28
re-election victory, which was marred by irregularities and
allegations of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ''It must be part of a strategy to penetrate communications,''
opposition Congressman Jorge del Castillo told The Associated
Press, adding that Fujimori must sign the law before it goes into
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Osiptel President Jorge Kunigami said Thursday that increased
powers will allow the agency to enforce regulations, levy fines and
promote competition in the telecommunications sector.

<HEADLINE> Inheritance Tax Vote Heads to Senate  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican bill to abolish federal
inheritance taxes was loaded Thursday with billions of dollars in
election-year tax breaks by the Senate, which still planned to pass
the measure by week's end in defiance of President Clinton's veto
threat.
</P>
<P>
   Before the final vote -- scheduled for Friday -- senators attached
amendments to repeal the 3 percent telephone excise tax, scrap some
taxes on Social Security benefits and help farmers. The Senate
defeated measures to increase money available for a Medicare
prescription drug benefit and to temporarily suspend the federal
gas tax.
</P>
<P>
   Republican supporters said the ''death tax,'' which reaches a
top rate of 55 percent, hinders investment and job creation, forces
millions of people to do costly estate planning and particularly
hurts farmers and small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought government was supposed to protect our property, not
confiscate it -- not penalize someone because they've been
successful,'' said Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which passed the House in June, would cut the top 55
percent estate tax rate in 2001 and then gradually phase out all
other rates, with full repeal coming in 2010. The cost was
estimated at $105 billion during the phaseout, ballooning to $750
billion in the decade after repeal would be fully in effect.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said government's revenue loss would be cushioned
somewhat because the bill changes the way assets are valued -- known
as basis -- so that an heir would owe higher capital gains taxes
than under current law once the asset is sold. Capital gains tax
rates, however, are much lower than estate tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   ''It removes death as the trigger for any tax,'' said Sen. Jon
Kyl, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the enormous cost of repeal and the fact that
heirs of only 2 percent of people who die pay estate taxes was
evidence that Republicans wanted mainly to help the rich. In 1997,
for example, only 43,000 estates out of 2.7 million adult deaths
were subjected to the estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do we really have to protect the billionaires?'' said Senate
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. ''We are talking about the
richest 2 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate voted 53-46 to defeat a Democratic substitute
costing $64 billion over 10 years that would have sharply raised
estate tax exemptions -- now $675,000 per individual -- particularly
for the farmers and small businesses that are hurt the most.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle added that Clinton will certainly veto the bill and that
Democrats would be able to sustain it. ''This isn't going
anyplace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides used the debate to highlight some of their other
priorities to cut taxes and to argue for using the growing federal
budget surplus for other spending or to reduce the public debt. In
some cases, the votes were intended mainly for political
consumption by senators up for re-election this year.
</P>
<P>
   In votes on amendments Thursday, the Senate:
</P>
<P>
   --By a 97-3 vote, approved an amendment by Sen. William Roth,
R-Del., to immediately repeal the 3 percent excise tax on telephone
service that dates from the Spanish-American War. A House-passed
version would phase out repeal over three years.
</P>
<P>
   --Approved, 58-41, an amendment by Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn., that
would repeal a 1993 law imposing income taxes on 85 percent,
instead of 50 percent, of the Social Security benefits over $34,000
for a single taxpayer, $44,000 for a married couple.
</P>
<P>
   --Defeated, 53-46, an attempt by Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., to
increase the money budgeted for a Medicare prescription drug
benefit from $40 billion to $80 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   --Voted 59-40 against an effort by Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich.,
to suspend the 18.3-cent federal gasoline tax for 150 days to help
ease high prices at the pump. Opponents said it would jeopardize
money used for transportation projects.
</P>
<P>
   --Approved on a voice vote an amendment by Sen. Charles Grassley,
R-Iowa, giving several tax breaks to farmers, including creation of
tax-deferred accounts in which they could deposit up to 20 percent
of their earnings. The measure also would repeal a law passed last
year forcing small businesses to pay income taxes on certain sales
immediately, even if the buyers were paying in installments.
</P>
<P>
   --Voted 98-1 to make the business research and development tax
credit permanent. It was extended for five years last year.
</P>
<P>
   --Defeated, 52-46, an amendment to create a tax credit of up to
$12,000 for college tuition.
</P>
<P>
   If the bill were to pass with any of these amendments, it would
have to return to the House for negotiations. But under the bill's
rules of debate, GOP leaders could strike all amendments by
substituting the original House estate tax bill prior to final
passage.
</P>
<P>
   Abolition of the estate tax is a top priority for Republicans
and several powerful lobbying groups, including the National
Federation of Independent Business, the National Association of
Manufacturers and the American Farm Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   It is supported by Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive
GOP presidential nominee, and is certain to be an issue in the fall
presidential and congressional campaigns if Clinton follows through
on his veto threat.

<HEADLINE> Elton John Performs in Liverpool  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) -- Elton John made a long-awaited return
to Liverpool Thursday with his first show there in 18 years, and
dedicated his performance to one of the city's most famous sons,
John Lennon.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Elton played a three hour set of ballads and rock and roll
anthems such as ''Daniel'' and ''Candle in the Wind'' to a crowd of
3,500.
</P>
<P>
   Opening the song ''Empty Garden'', written for Lennon, he said:
''I have played this song in New York and Hamburg but the most
fitting place and the only place to play it is here in Liverpool.''
</P>
<P>
   The 53-year-old star sat at his Yamaha piano wearing a single
breasted red satin lounge suit embroidered with pink flowers and
the word Medusa emblazoned in diamante stones across his back.
</P>
<P>
   Introducing the number ''Ticking,'' about the gun culture in the
United States, he told the crowd: ''This song was written back in
the 1970s ... it is a sad indictment on America that absolutely
nothing has changed since then.''

<HEADLINE> Assembly OKs transportation funding; presses case on improper spending </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - On one hand, the state Assembly settled one
$3.8-billion piece of business Thursday by approving a bill to fund
highway and rail projects through 2004.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the lower house opened a new can of worms on
how part of that $3.8 billion will be spent. It puts lawmakers on a
possible collision course with Gov. Christie Whitman over the use
of transportation project money to pay staff expenses they believe
should come out of her general budget instead.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation funding created something of a rift within the
Republican ranks this year as Senate President Donald DiFrancesco
developed a program that diverts revenue from state coffers and
uses it for projects to be financed and run by the Transportation
Trust Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Voters will be asked in November to change the state
constitution to permanently commit for transportation use revenues
from the wholesale petroleum tax and the sales tax on cars.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10.5-cent gasoline tax, 9 cents already goes to the Trust
Fund. Voters will be asked to dedicate the remaining 1.5 cents to
that purpose as well.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman originally opposed this diversion, saying it was OK this
year but could threaten the solvency of future state budgets. She
ultimately relented.
</P>
<P>
   But a new problem emerged when the Assembly inserted into the
Transportation Trust Fund bill new provisions to limit how much of
this ''project'' money could be spent on staff salaries,
maintenance and administrative costs.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than accept these limits, the governor in June vetoed the
$3.8 billion package and sent it back to the Legislature with her
amendments. The Senate agreed quickly but the Assembly delayed
action.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Assembly lawmakers Thursday reluctantly accepted
Whitman's version of a four-year program by a vote of 74-1.
</P>
<P>
   But they then promptly passed a second bill, A-2715, by a 70-2
vote to basically restore the part of the Trust Fund law that
Whitman had cut out. It passed with more than enough votes to force
an override if the governor is unwilling to meet them halfway.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly Transportation chairman, Alex DeCroce, R-Morris,
said Whitman was using too much of these project funds as a cash
source to help balance her budget.
</P>
<P>
   DeCroce said this was unforgivably foolish because it meant that
bond financing, with an interest charge and a 15- to 20-year
repayment schedule, was being used to cover weekly payrolls.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said Thursday it is customary for some staff costs to be
charged against a project. If a highway is being expanded, for
instance, engineers must design the layout and surveyors must
layout the site. Their pay for doing this work is folded into the
project's overall costs, just like the bulldozer and the salary of
the bulldozer driver.
</P>
<P>
   ''The concern here is that if the work is being done on a
project that is a TTF-related project in construction or design,
then that is legitimate, that is part of the total cost. Projects
don't just happen. They have to be designed, they have to have the
engineering work done,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's legitimate to be considered as part of the project
because the demands on general revenues become huge when you don't
do that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   What this means is that an engineer paid $75,000 for his year of
work on a Trust Fund project is being paid with borrowed money that
has to be repaid over 15 or 20 years. One way of looking at it is
the $75,000 salary will end up costing taxpayers more than $200,000
when interest is added. Another way is that taxpayers in 2020 will
be still paying for the salary that engineer earned this year.
</P>
<P>
   DeCroce agreed this is a customary practice - to a degree.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the Whitman administration has abused this, using
Trust Fund financing to pay as much as $200 million a year in
salary and administrative costs, and even for maintenance on old
Trust Fund projects, which is virtually every road or bridge built
or repaired by the state since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   DeCroce said many of these staff costs ought to be funded in
cash through the annual state budget for the Transportation
department. ''We are well over what we should be doing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Trust Fund was meant to be a capital program which began
with capital improvements only,'' DeCroce said. ''What they are
attempting to do, in my opinion, is fund some of the
administration's costs through this bill.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trust Fund approved Thursday will spend between $900 million
and $950 million a year. DeCroce's clause would have capped the
salary and administrative spending at 14 percent this year, and
would have scaled it down to 10 percent by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman vetoed it, saying she could only accept a 13-percent cap
in future years and no cap at all this year.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Jack Collins said this might be an issue on
which the Legislature will override a veto from Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very committed to having the Transportation Trust Fund
used just for capital projects and so forth,'' Collins said. ''We
were thinking very seriously (about it).''

<HEADLINE> Brazil To Strengthen Air Force  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- President Fernando Henrique Cardoso
approved a $3 billion plan to modernize the country's aging air
force, the defense minister said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Geraldo Quintao said the air force will begin negotiations with
various aircraft manufacturers to get the best prices for the
modernization of 100 Brazilian fighter jets and the purchase of 76
new patrol planes.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian aircraft builder Embraer will collaborate with the
government on at least three programs, Quintao said.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's long-neglected air force has been showing signs of
serious fraying in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The air force's has an annual budget of $183 million. Defense
analysts say that level of funding leaves it unable to patrol all
of the country's airspace and would be incapable of defending
itself in a medium-intensity conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Of the air force's 53 top-of-the-line AMX fighters, only 13 are
in working order, and of the 18 planes used to transport top
officials only four are working.
</P>
<P>
   But others have questioned the need for a well-funded air force
in a country with no immediate threats from its neighbors and
seriously underfunded highways and health services.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   ACRA, N.Y. (AP) - Police believe an 80-year-old man shot his
dying, 93-year-old wife then killed himself late Wednesday or early
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of Michael and Agnes Fromm were found in bed by a
neighbor making a daily check on the couple in their home in this
hamlet 28 miles southwest of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   State police Senior Investigator David Darling said it appears
Michael Fromm shot his wife, who was dying of colon cancer, three
times in the chest before using the unlicensed, .32-caliber
revolver to kill himself.
</P>
<P>
   Darling told the Kingston Daily Freeman that police believe Mrs.
Fromm was suffering badly in the hours leading up to the shooting.
Mr. Fromm was her primary provider though she had been receiving
hospice care since June.
</P>
<P>
   The couple retired to Acra in Greene County in the late 1970s
after living in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Darling said Michael Fromm also was ill, suffering from heart
disease. He had told neighbors he could not live without his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The couple had no children.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers Activate Shaw From DL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Los Angeles Dodgers closer Jeff Shaw, who
hasn't pitched since June 26, was activated from the 15-day
disabled list on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Being on the DL is the worst thing in the world,'' said Shaw,

in 19 opportunities and an 8.00 ERA in 29 outings overall this
year. Manager Davey Johnson will not put the right-hander back in
the closer's role immediately, instead, he will make his decisions
based on individual matchups.
</P>
<P>
   ''As time goes on, it'll work itself out. I don't think it'll
take that long,'' said Shaw, who went on the DL because of
tendinitis in his right elbow. ''But I'm going to do whatever is
right for this bullpen, to get us on a streak to where we can save
some ballgames.

   During the All-Star break, the Dodgers optioned reliever Jamie

<P>
   Hundley took a foul tip on his right thumb last Friday at
Seattle, and is expected to miss at least three games.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also announced the signing of their sixth round pick
in the June draft, Gregory Withelder of Wallingford, Pa., a
left-handed pitcher for Wilmington College in Delaware.

U.S.-Vietnam Trade Pact Signed
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and Vietnam signed a landmark trade
agreement today, marking what President Clinton hailed as ''another historic
step in the process of normalization, reconciliation and healing between our two
nations.'' It provides Vietnam with access to the world's largest market on the
same terms the United States grants to most other nations. The deal was signed
by U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and Vietnam's Trade Minister Vu
Khoan. Vietnam agreed to sharply lower its tariffs and trade barriers on a wide
range of U.S.-manufactured products, farm goods and financial and other
services.

Senate Mulls Inheritance Tax Bill
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican bill to abolish federal inheritance taxes was
readied today for a final Senate vote despite a veto threat from President
Clinton and Democratic arguments that it would amount to a windfall for the
wealthy. Before the vote -- scheduled for tomorrow -- senators attached an
amendment to repeal the 3 percent telephone excise tax and defeated measures to
increase money available for a Medicare prescription drug benefit and to
temporarily suspend the federal gas tax. Republican supporters said the ''death
tax,'' which reaches a top rate of 55 percent, hinders investment and job
creation, forces millions of people to do costly estate planning and
particularly hurts farmers and small businesses.

is more widespread than previously thought, with almost five percent of women

New AIDS Drugs on the Horizon
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) -- An entirely new class of AIDS drugs on the
horizon may offer just-in-time help to many patients whose treatment options are
running out, researchers said today. The latest data suggest these drugs may
dramatically restore health -- at least temporarily -- to people dying because
the virus has grown resistant to all the currently available AIDS medicines. The
new drugs block HIV in a different way from the standard medicines that have
revolutionized AIDS treatment in recent years. Instead of gumming up the virus's
ability to manufacture new copies of itself, they block the virus from getting
inside blood cells.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks Get Two Sluggers Back  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Third baseman Matt Williams and first baseman
Erubiel Durazo were activated from the disabled list Thursday by
the Arizona Diamondbacks, who regained some offensive for their
interleague series against Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Both had been on the DL for the second time this season,
Williams with a strained right quadriceps and Durazo because of
pain in his right wrist following surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona optioned outfielder Rob Ryan to Triple-A Tucson and used
the disabled list for the 12th time this season, placing infielder
Danny Klassen on the DL with turf toe in his right foot.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who was returned to his customary cleanup spot, missed
the first 43 games with a broken right foot and the last 15 after
straining his quad on June 25.
</P>
<P>
   He aggravated the injury on Sunday during a rehabilitation
assignment with Class A High Desert, but Showalter decided to bring
the slugger back after watching him take batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   The injuries have caused Williams, who had 35 home runs and 143
RBIs last year, to struggle to find his groove. He hit .269, with
two homers and four RBIs in 25 games and was 1-for-25 with runners
in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   Durazo had wrist surgery to repair cartilage damage June 1 and
went on the DL for the first time. He returned June 24 and played
in two games before joining Williams and right-hander Todd
Stottlemyre on the DL.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre has tendinitis in his throwing elbow and isn't
expected to return until September.

<HEADLINE> Albright Renews Montenegro Support  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
reassured the leader of Montenegro Thursday that the U.S. still
supports the Balkan nation in the face of Serbian hostility.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone call, Albright told Montenegrin President Milo
Djukanovic of the Clinton administration's plan to provide another
$16.5 million for continued economic and political reform. In the
last fiscal year, the U.S. has already allocated $60.56 million for
assistance to Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Djukanovic, angry at constitutional changes passed
last week by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's government,
said his nation is no longer part of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Once a federation that included a half-dozen Balkan republics,
Yugoslavia has in recent years consisted only of Montenegro and its
dominant partner, Serbia. But Djukanovic said that with the latest
federal constitutional changes -- and Montenegro's decision to
ignore them -- his republic has left Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavian leader Slobodan Milosevic's regime has tried to
provoke conflict in Montenegro, as well as excluding its
representatives from the Yugoslavian parliament, the State
Department noted. Last week, Milosevic succeeded in making changes
to the Yugoslavian constitution, reducing Montenegro's role in the
election of the federal president and the upper house of the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro has rejected the amendments as illegitimate.

<HEADLINE> Circus will leave elephants home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GLENS FALLS, N.Y. (AP) - Look for the lions and the tigers, the
Flying Wallendas' and the fire-eating sword swallower.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't come to the Circus Royale expecting to see elephants.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping out of the big top of big time attention focused on the
treatment of the big gray circus staples, Circus Royale President
Jim McConnell said he'll leave the elephants home when his show
rolls into town Sept. 28.
</P>
<P>
   The circus has also canceled the elephants' performances at all
but one other venue on its autumn tour.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've talked it through, and at this place and time, the issue
has to be resolved,'' McConnell told the Post-Star of Glens Falls.
''We're in the entertainment business, and it's in our interest to
entertain the public. The public has to arrive at their values. But
we know the animals are treated well. I can't stand to see animals
mistreated. But we'll still wait until the issue is resolved.'' The
issue of animal treatment has made to the national stage. In June,
U.S. Rep. Sam Farr, D-Calif., introduced a bill to outlaw use of
elephants in traveling shows and for rides. Hearings were held on
Capitol Hill to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearings, animal rights activists like ''The Price Is
Right'' host Bob Barker railed against the use of elephants,
calling it cruel and pointing out the 30 people killed by elephants
since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Circus advocates, though, maintain their animals are well cared
for and argue the fatalities are mostly handlers in one of the most
dangerous professions in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Glens Falls is 46 miles north of Albany.

<HEADLINE> Kids at Waco Reportedly Were Shot  </HEADLINE>
By SHERRI CHUNN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas (AP) -- The government finished its defense in a
wrongful death case with emotional testimony from an FBI agent who
had entered the burning Branch Davidian compound April 19, 1993,
and struggled to pull a sect member to safety.
</P>
<P>
   James McGee, a Hostage Rescue Team member, recalled how he
watched Ruth Riddle jump from the second floor of the burning
building and then walk back inside.
</P>
<P>
   ''I found her about 8 to 12 feet inside laying on the floor,
laying face down,'' McGee said Thursday. ''She was resistant and
said, 'No, leave me alone.'''
</P>
<P>
   McGee said Riddle did not respond when he asked where the
children were.
</P>
<P>
   ''If she had told me, I would have gone after the children or
died trying,'' said McGee, who received a Medal of Valor for his
actions.
</P>
<P>
   Closing arguments were scheduled for Friday morning, and the
jury was expected to get the case soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors and relatives of the more than 80 Davidians who died
in the raid and fire are suing the government for $675 million.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers also presented autopsy findings Thursday that
they said were further proof that cult members were suicidal and
started the fires that burned the compound to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys read the results of 21 autopsies on adults,
children and one infant, some still unidentified, whose remains
were recovered after the complex was engulfed in flames. Twenty
died of gunshot wounds. One toddler died of a stab wound to the
chest.
</P>
<P>
   Cult survivors and relatives say the members were not suicidal
and that the government shares responsibility for the deaths on the
final day of a 51-day standoff.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the plaintiffs have argued that FBI tanks
caused or contributed to some of the three fires that swept the
building.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, government fire expert James Quintiere testified
that the three fires that eventually enveloped the compound all
began within a two-minute span and were probably set by cult
members.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, the FBI acknowledged firing a ''very limited
number'' of pyrotechnic rounds during the operation, after years of
publicly denying that any potentially incendiary devices were used.
</P>
<P>
   A five-member jury is acting as an advisory panel to U.S.
District Judge Walter Smith, who will deliver a verdict in the
case.

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays 6, Expos 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Gerald Williams hit a two-run homer
during a three-run fifth inning as the Tampa Bay Devil Rays beat
the Montreal Expos 6-4 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Vinny Castilla had an RBI single in a two-run seventh as the
Devil Rays snapped a 4-4 tie en route to their just fourth victory
in 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Guerrero hit a two-run homer and Chris Widger added a
solo shot for the Expos. Montreal (42-43) is 11-20 since matching a
season-high by going eight games over .500 on June 5.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Mecir (7-1) worked a scoreless 1 2-3 innings and Roberto
Hernandez got three outs for his 13th save in 18 opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal reliever Felipe Lira (2-1) gave up two runs and two
hits in 1 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero's 24th homer of the season put the Expos up 2-0 in the
first inning. In four games at Tropicana Field, Guerrero has three
homers and eight RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay got a run back in the bottom of the first on Bubba
Trammell's RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   The potential tying run, Mike DiFelice, was thrown out at the
plate by Montreal center fielder Peter Bergeron on Williams'
second-inning single.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos took a 3-1 lead on a fifth-inning sacrifice fly by
Jose Vidro.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' 10th homer tied the game at 3. The blast went an
estimated 405 feet and struck a speaker hanging from an overhead
catwalk 110 feet above the playing surface.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay took its first lead, 4-3, later in the fifth when
Steve Cox doubled and scored on Fred McGriff's single.
</P>
<P>
   Widger's 11th homer drew the Expos even in the seventh. But
Trammell's fielder's choice and Castilla's RBI single in the bottom
of the inning gave Tampa Bay a two-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's Bryan Rekar gave up four runs and eight hits in 6
1-3 innings. Expos starter Javier Vazquez allowed four runs and 10
hits over 4 2-3 innings. Vazquez struck out seven and has fanned 43
in his last 39 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal first baseman Lee Stevens, who missed one game after
being hit in the right wrist Saturday by David Wells' pitch, was in
the starting lineup and went 0-for-3 with a walk.
</P>
<P>
Notes Montreal RHP Hideki Irabu (right knee) allowed one run and
five hits over 5 2-3 innings in his second rehab start for Class-A
Jupiter of the Florida State League. ... Expos OF Rondell White
(right hamstring strain) was out of the lineup for the third
straight game. ... Eight of the 22 fair balls hitting a catwalk at
Tropicana Field have occurred this season. ... Castilla has gone 86
at-bats without a homer, and has gone deep just once in his last
161 at-bats. ... DiFelice singled in the second inning to extend
his hitting streak to eight games, equaling his career high.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Orders Arrest of Ex-Pres.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the
arrest of ousted president Jamil Mahuad on charges of illegally
freezing bank accounts last year.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest order for Mahuad, who was toppled from power after a
military-backed Indian uprising on Jan. 21, was issued by Supreme
Court President Galo Pico, who also called for the arrest of former
Finance Minister Ana Lucia Armijos.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court is investigating charges that Mahuad and
Armijos exceeded their constitutional authority when they partially
froze private bank accounts in March 1999 in an attempt to save
Ecuador's collapsing financial system.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of depositors were told they would have to
wait a year before they could withdraw their money.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are indications that the commission of various crimes
were committed against constitutional guarantees and against public
administration,'' the arrest order said.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations stem from separate criminal complaints lodged by
Victor Granda, a socialist movement leader, and Congressman
Napoleon Gomez, of the conservative Social Christian party.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts have said if Mahuad and Armijos are convicted,
they could face up to five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Mahuad's brother, Eduardo, said last week that the former
president is in the United States lecturing at Harvard. Local
newspaper reports said Armijos is in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   After the aborted military coup, Mahuad was replaced by his vice
president, Gustavo Noboa. The new president has largely carried on
with Mahuad's economic programs, including a plan to convert
Ecuador to an all-U.S. dollar economy.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was forced from office, Mahuad was widely condemned
for bailing out 18 failed banks last year at a cost of $1.2 billion
after the bankers stole the funds and fled abroad.

<HEADLINE> Matthaeus Meets With Club Officials  </HEADLINE>
By BRIAN TRUSDELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- German star Lothar Matthaeus met Thursday with
New York-New Jersey MetroStars general manager Nick Sakiewicz and
coach Octavio Zambrano to discuss his future with the team.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, which also included the player's agent, Brian
Eylert, came a day after Matthaeus returned from a nine-day trip to
Europe. Matthaeus received permission from the club for the trip to
treat his injured back, but also ended up on the cover of the
German tabloid Bild in a photo showing him lounging on the beach in
St. Tropez, France, with his girlfriend, Maren Mueller-Wohlfahrt.
</P>
<P>
   ''A good deal of the meeting dealt with getting an understanding
of the injury,'' Sakiewicz said. ''Part of it was the injury, part
of it were the circumstances that happened in Germany. A lot of
issues were discussed, including his entire stay in MLS. I wouldn't
say 90 percent of it dealt with the picture in Bild.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of it did, adding another chapter to Matthaeus' short,
but controversial tenure with the Major League Soccer club.
</P>
<P>
   Sakiewicz said Matthaeus won't make the trip to Boston for
Saturday's game against New England and that it's possible the
MetroStars would place the 39-year-old German on injured reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no comment on his release,'' Sakiewicz said. ''Guys
like Lothar have tons of options. But nothing was discussed to that
effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Sakiewicz said Matthaeus is suffering from essentially a slipped
disc in his back, which he injured June 28 against San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   The match was Matthaeus' first for the MetroStars in six weeks
after he left the team following a May 13 game to join the German
national side for the European Championship. The MetroStars were
3-6-0 when Matthaeus left, but went on to win seven of their next
nine without him to climb atop the MLS' Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Sakiewicz said the two sides will meet again by next Wednesday,
but no time has been set.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a major issue for us,'' Sakiewicz said.

<HEADLINE> Braves 6, Orioles 3  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Greg Maddux outpitched Mike Mussina and Bobby
Bonilla singled in the tiebreaking run in the seventh inning as the
Atlanta Braves beat Baltimore 6-3 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux (11-3) allowed three runs, eight hits and two walks in
seven innings to earn his second consecutive win after two straight
defeats. It was his first appearance since July 4 due to a shoulder
injury that forced the right-hander to miss one start and skip the
All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   Mussina (6-8) yielded only six hits in his third complete game,
struck out eight and retired the side in order six times. But the
Braves scored three runs in the fourth, snapped a 3-3 tie in the
seventh and added two insurance runs in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker, greeted by a chorus of boos from the sellout crowd
of 47,284, started the ninth but walked Will Clark on four pitches.
Scott Kamieniecki finished for his first save of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Andres Galarraga led off the seventh with a single and took
second on a groundout before Bonilla grounded a soft single to
right. Bonilla, a former Oriole, had struck out in his previous two
at-bats against Mussina and was batting .229 against right-handed
pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Sanders, who entered as a pinch-runner for Bonilla,
singled in a run in the ninth and scored on a squeeze bunt by Walt
Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles scored in the second when Clark hit a two-out single
and Harold Baines followed with an RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's first nine batters were retired before taking a 3-1
lead in the fourth. Andruw Jones hit a one-out double, Chipper
Jones walked and Brian Jordan doubled in a run. Galarraga then
drove in a run with a grounder and Wally Joyner followed with an
RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore pulled even in the fifth on an RBI single by Albert
Belle and a run-scoring grounder by B.J. Surhoff.
Notes: Baltimore's Delino DeShields recorded his team-high 22nd
stolen base, the first since June 28. ... Atlanta 2B Quilvio Veras
was scratched from the lineup due to illness. He was replaced by
Keith Lockhart. ... Baltimore fell to 23-14 at home. ... Before the
game the Braves activated LHP Mike Remlinger from the disabled list
and designated RHP Dave Stevens for assignment. ... Sanders' 10th
steal in the ninth inning enabled him to reach double figures for
the eighth straight season.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Chuck Knoblauch left the New York Yankees' game
against the Florida Marlins in the seventh inning on Thursday night
with a bruised left wrist after being hit by a line drive.
</P>
<P>
   With no outs in the seventh, Preston Wils hit a line drive
toward second base. Knoblauch jumped too high for the ball, which
ricocheted off his left forearm and into center field for a single.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch, who missed seven games earlier this season with
soreness in his left forearm also bruised his left thumb on the
play. X-rays were negative and Knoblauch was scheduled to undergo a
CT scan on Friday. There was no immediate word on whether he would
miss any time for this injury.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch has had trouble in the field all year, making 15
errors in the first half of the season. He fielded his only two
chances Thursday flawlessly.

<HEADLINE> Bill Bradley Endorses Al Gore  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Bill Bradley slapped Al Gore a
''high-five'' on Thursday and sealed his endorsement of the vice
president, four months after conceding their fight for the White
House. ''Winning is a team sport,'' Bradley said, with no hint of
the acrimony of last winter's primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Gore called Bradley ''a good Democrat who speaks and stands for
principles we all believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   With the high-five that turned into a clasp of fists held aloft,
the two Democrats joined forces against Republican presidential
contender George W. Bush and appeared to bury any remnants of the
harsh primary contests, which Gore swept.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were at each other's throats, so to speak; this brings
the party back together again and unity is what (Gore) needs,''
said Dennis Naidl, a teacher and independent who said he voted for
Bradley in Wisconsin's primary.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, polls indicate Gore is having a harder time rallying his
party than Bush is having with Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   From beneath a big ''United for Gore'' banner, Bradley and Gore
strolled smiling into a bayside park to the tune ''I'll take you
there.''
</P>
<P>
   They spoke to a crowd of about 1,000, including some pro-Bush
demonstrators who shouted ''Liar!'' The demonstrators carried
posters that quoted Bradley's bitter primary-season criticisms of
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Bradley said that under Gore ''we will come closer
to solving the problems (of child poverty, racism and the
uninsured) than under the leadership of Governor George W. Bush.
And it's not even close.''
</P>
<P>
   He saluted Gore's understanding of ''technological forces
changing America,'' a reminder that some critics say Bush isn't
smart enough to be a good 21st century president.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm here in Green Bay today because what Vince Lombardi once
said is true, 'Winning is a team sport.' Our party is strongest
when we are unified,'' Bradley said. ''Today I want to make it
clear that I endorse Al Gore for president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Endorse was the word he hadn't used when he conceded to Gore on
March 9, the word Sen. John McCain repeated six times in his
similar appearance in May with GOP primary foe Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was enjoying the lift. ''This is one of the most important
days in the election,'' he told supporters seeing him off at the
airport, as he left for a town-hall meeting in Saginaw, Mich. Late
Wednesday night, after a fiery speech to the NAACP, Gore twisted
his hips James-Brown style and sang out aboard his plane: ''I
fee-eel good!''
</P>
<P>
   In working-class Saginaw, Gore faced tough questions as several
blunt-speaking undecided voters forced him to defend his advocacy
of the death penalty and free trade with China. At least two women
admonished him to remember they have a progressive alternative in
Green Party candidate Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   One woman sternly admonished: ''It has felt to me like the
Clinton-Gore administration gave an awful lot of ground back to the
right and I would like to know why I should vote for you and not
Ralph Nader. And don't tell me, 'Because I'll split the vote.
That's not an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Gore promised Bradley ''an important part of this
campaign'' -- starting with, according to party sources, a
prime-time speech on the second night of the Democratic National
Convention next month.
</P>
<P>
   A Bradley strategist said the former senator will release the
delegates he won in the primaries -- 300 plus -- to vote for Gore's
nomination, but not before a final rally in the convention city
with his own supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley partisans emphasize he has not ruled out a future
presidential bid. He was in Chicago on Wednesday night for a
''thank you'' party for supporters to ''keep his network alive,''
as one ally put it.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore camp wanted the rally with Bradley -- their first joint
appearance since the primary debates -- in Wisconsin, a state where
Democrats have historically done well but where polls now show a
close fight.
</P>
<P>
   Given the progressive tradition here, Wisconsin also could be
ripe for Nader, who appears, in statewide polls, to be siphoning
support for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley will help broaden Gore's appeal, said homemaker Alison
Frazier. Given Gore's image as ''a fierce competitor,'' Bradley's
''heart-and-soul passion for public service is a nice complement to
the vice president,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The primaries brought out the aggressive campaigner in Gore, who
labeled Bradley a reckless liberal and someone out to shred the
government's health-care safety net for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Gore said Bradley ''brought high purpose and high
ideals to our contest.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee released a greatest-hits list
of Bradley's earlier gripes about Gore, including: ''You are the
elephant of negative campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
   There are hints that bruises remain.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign has not offered work to any of Bradley's top-
or midlevel former aides. And the wide net that Warren Christopher
has cast for advice as he leads Gore's search for a running mate
has not included Bradley.

<HEADLINE> Tigers 8, Astros 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Dean Palmer hit three run-scoring singles as the
Detroit Tigers beat the Houston Astros for the first time in seven
meetings, 8-2 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Becker hit two doubles and scored three runs for the
Tigers, 0-6 against the Astros in interleague play in 1998 and
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit has won seven of 10 overall and 12 of 18, while Houston
-- the worst team in the major leagues at 30-58 -- has lost five of
seven and 18 of 24.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Moehler (6-5) gave up 11 hits and two runs in his first
complete game of the season. Helped by three double plays, he won
for the fifth time in seven decisions. He walked two and struck out
one.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Reynolds (6-6) lasted just 51 pitches and 3 1-3 innings,
allowing seven runs and seven hits. Reynolds lost his third
straight decision and hasn't won in five starts since beating
Colorado on June 13.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Polonia singled leading off the first and scored on a
double by Becker, who came home on Palmer's single.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer hit another RBI single in the third after consecutive
walks to Becker and Bobby Higginson.
</P>
<P>
   Daryle Ward's run-scoring single pulled the Astros to 3-1 in the
fourth after Richard Hidalgo reached on a fielder's choice, stole
second and moved up on Deivi Cruz's fielding error.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit chased Reynolds in a four-run, five-hit fourth that
included another RBI single from Palmer, a run-scoring single from
Higginson and Polonia's sacrifice fly. Another run scored on right
fielder Lance Berkman's fielding error.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros added a run in the eighth on Hidalgo's RBI forceout.
The Tigers answered back in the bottom of the inning with Polonia's
sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Berkman had a nightmarish fourth inning. He was thrown out
at home by Palmer while trying to score on Hidalgo's grounder to
third in the top of the inning, then overran Juan Encarnacion's
single for an error and missed a diving attempt on Cruz's single in
the bottom half. ... Moehler is 5-1 with a 3.04 ERA in seven starts
at Comerica Park. ... Houston's Jeff Bagwell was 0-for-4, ending a
10-game hitting streak. ... The Tigers are 7-6 and the Astros 4-6
in interleague play. ... Reynolds lost for the second time in six
road decisions.

officers. The U.S. Justice Department opened an investigation into whether
Thomas Jones' civil rights were violated, and black leaders decried the beating
as police brutality. A dozen officers -- black and white -- surrounded Jones,
30, as he was beaten and kicked on the street in the middle of the day
yesterday, moments after a stolen car chase and a shootout in which he and a
policeman were wounded. The beating was recorded from a TV news helicopter and

amendment to repeal the 3 percent telephone excise tax and defeated measures to
increase money available for a Medicare prescription drug benefit and to

<HEADLINE> House Passes Foreign Aid Bill  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House passed a foreign aid bill Thursday
after adding money for the world's indebted nations and the global
battle against AIDS. But Democrats said it still won't help
millions who suffer in poverty, hunger and sickness.
</P>
<P>
   The 239-185 vote approved $13.3 billion for next year for a
range of economic, military, development and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   The total package was still a half billion dollars less than
approved for this fiscal year. And it was $1.8 billion less than
President Clinton had requested, leaving it a candidate for
presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have obligations to our constituents, our taxpayers and to
the fellow human beings with whom we share this planet,'' said Rep.
David R. Obey, D-Wis.
</P>
<P>
   He said the proposed spending ''does not meet our obligations on
all three fronts'' and falls ''far short of what is required for a
presidential signature.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has yet to complete work on its version of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The final version of the House bill increased money that had
earlier been cut from two programs Democrats were particulary
attached to -- debt relief for the world's poorest nations and AIDS
treatment to combat the epidemic ravaging Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those were significant (but) we certainly did not go the full
distance,'' said Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   On one amendment, lawmakers voted to restore $42 million that
the House Appropriations Committee had cut from Clinton's request
of $244 million for combating AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   With another, they raised from $69 million to $225 million the
money that would be spent for debt forgiveness for the world's 40
poorest countries next year.
</P>
<P>
   But they didn't give the administraton the $110 million it had
sought for debt relief in this fiscal year -- meaning Clinton got
only $225 million of the $435 million he had sought for the two
years.
</P>
<P>
   And the money added for both AIDS and debt relief was taken from
other funds -- mostly from funds for foreign military aid and
training.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., said the bill was ''the best that
we can do,'' given budgetary restraints Congress has imposed on
itself to hold down spending.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have now a good bill,'' he said, later admitting the
legislation had ''some deficiencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Gene Sperling, head of
the president's National Economic Council, told reporters Wednesday
that cutting Clinton's request for debt relief would prevent the
United States from meeting its obligations under a program launched
last year by the world's richest industrial countries.
</P>
<P>
   At last year's G-7 summit of the world's seven richest countries
-- the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and
Canada -- pledged to write off $50 billion in debt owed by poor
nations.
</P>
<P>
   The vote Thursday comes as Clinton prepares to attend the annual
summit again -- next week in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without American leadership, debt relief will never become a
reality,'' said Rep. Maxine Waters, the California Democrat who
sponsored the amendment restoring some of Clinton's debt request.
</P>
<P>
   Other money in the bill included:
</P>
<P>
   -- $2.8 billion in economic and military assistance for Israel,
the largest single recipient of U.S. aid every year.
</P>
<P>
   -- $2 billion in economic and military assistance for Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   -- $2.9 billion for programs run by the U.S. Agency for
International Development.
</P>
<P>
   -- $834 million for child health programs.
</P>
<P>
   -- $160 million for emergency disaster aid for Southern Africa
including flood-ravaged Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
   -- $40 million for land mine removal.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 4811

Philadelphia Police Dept. Decried Over Beating
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia mayor and the police department came
under fire Thursday over the videotaped beating of a black man by a group of
officers. The U.S. Justice Department opened an investigation into whether
Thomas Jones' civil rights were violated, and black leaders decried the beating
as police brutality. A dozen officers -- black and white -- surrounded Jones,
30, as he was beaten and kicked on the street in the middle of the day
yesterday, moments after a stolen car chase and a shootout in which he and a
policeman were wounded. The beating was recorded from a TV news helicopter and
broadcast around the country.

Senate Mulls Inheritance Tax Bill
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican bill to abolish federal inheritance taxes was
readied Thursday for a final Senate vote despite a veto threat from President
Clinton and Democratic arguments that it would amount to a windfall for the
wealthy. Before the vote -- scheduled for tomorrow -- senators attached an
amendment to repeal the 3 percent telephone excise tax and defeated measures to
increase money available for a Medicare prescription drug benefit and to
temporarily suspend the federal gas tax. Republican supporters said the ''death
tax'' hinders investment and job creation, forces millions of people to do
costly estate planning and particularly hurts farmers and small businesses.
