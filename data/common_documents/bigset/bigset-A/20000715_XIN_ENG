<HEADLINE> More Care for AIDS Orphans: Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States Agency for
International Development (USAID) Thursday called on the world to
treat children orphaned by the AIDS pandemic with greater love and
compassion.
</P>
<P>
"The world community must unite in compassionate response and
support," the government aid group said in its "Children on the
Brink" report released on Thursday at the 13th International AIDS
Conference in Durban, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"We must scale up responses dramatically. The HIV/AIDS
pandemic is producing orphans on a scale unrivaled in world
history," said John Williamson, co-author of the report.
</P>
<P>
Revised estimates said that 15.6 million children under the age
of 15 have already lost their mother or both parents to AIDS or
other causes.
</P>
<P>
According to USAID, AIDS will produce 24.3 million orphans by
2010 even by conservative estimates.
</P>
<P>
The disease's soaring infection rates would continue for at
least another three decades and if infection rates continue at the
current pace, the figure is likely to be 44 million and 88 percent
of them will live in sub-Saharan Africa, USAID said.
</P>
<P>
The disease is killing breadwinners and communities are being
wiped out, the organization said, noting that children are going
without food, education, role models and other basic rights like
the need for affection and care.
</P>
<P>
In its study covering 34 developing countries, USAID said that
AIDS currently accounts for about half of all orphans and this
figure are expected to surge.
</P>
<P>
The orphan crisis is holistic and all parentless children
require care, not only those with HIV, USAID stressed.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Hails Nigeria's Women Empowerment Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's Fund (
UNICEF) has commended Nigeria's efforts in improving the lot of
the country's women by making and implementing sound national
policies on women.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference on "Gender equality, development and
peace for the 21st century" in the Nigerian capital Abuja on
Wednesday, the agency's representative in Nigeria Georgiana Ngeri-
Nwagha said that Nigeria is on the path to full women empowerment.
</P>
<P>
She described the ban on female genital mutilation in Edo,
Cross River and Ogun states in southern Nigeria as "one of the
most courageous decisions" and hoped that other states would
follow suit, the News Agency of Nigeria reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ngeri-Nwagha welcomed the inclusion of six female ministers in
the current cabinet of the Nigerian government and praised the new
national policy on women and an improved female enrollment in
schools.
</P>
<P>
However, she complained about the continued existence of the
practice of early marriages, wife battering and discrimination
against girls, as well as the problems of AIDS and a high
mortality rate among women as areas that require serious attention
to ensure true emancipation of women.
</P>
<P>
She pledged the agency's continued assistance to women
development programs in the west African country.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's first lady Stella Obasanjo told the conference that
since women form 50 percent of the productive capacity, failure to
harness their potentials would affect the growth of any economy.
</P>
<P>
Realization has transformed the equality question from its
former social, legal and moral aspects to an economic imperative,
which has won more men over to the positive side of the gender
equality debate, she said.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll of Nigeria Pipeline Fire Rises to 300 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from Monday night's
oil pipeline explosion at villages near Nigeria's oil town Warri
in the country's southern Niger Delta region has risen to 300.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Jerry Gana, who confirmed the death toll
in the capital Abuja on Thursday, expressed the government's
condolence to the families of the victims and said that relevant
agents had been dispatched to the scene for on-the-spot assessment.
</P>
<P>
"Please help to educate our people that they can do better
things with their hands instead of risking their lives," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Delta Governor James Ibori, who described the
accident as an "avoidable holocaust", urged the federal government
to institute a commission of inquiry into the incident.
</P>
<P>
The governor has set up his own task force to prevent a
recurrence of such accidents, which took place from time to time.
</P>
<P>
Authorities of the state had earlier appealed for the wounded
to come forward for hospital treatment.
</P>
<P>
Most of the injured have reportedly sought help from
traditional doctors because they feared arrest on suspicion of
stealing oil if they had gone to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred between the villages of Adeje and Ovire
Court outside Warri, a major oil town in the south of Africa's
largest oil-exporting country, when people were using buckets to
collect petrol flowing from the pipeline after it had been
punctured by thieves on Sunday night.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Boost Handling of Transit Cargo: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
Friday said that his government has embarked on restructuring
measures aimed at expediting handling of transit cargo by
improving effectiveness and efficiency of the Port of Mombasa in
southeastern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Moi made the remarks here when holding lengthy talks with
visiting Rwandese President Paul Kagame, who arrived in the
country Friday morning for a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Since a sizable volume of Rwanda's imports and exports transit
through Kenya, Moi said, his government is undergoing
rehabilitation of the northern corridor and has introduced block
trains by the State Railway Corporation to facilitate quick
passage of transit cargo.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Moi told his counterpart that the prospects
of the establishment of a free trade area among the members of the
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa will create new
opportunities for boosting trade between Kenya and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Moi expressed his hope that President Kagame's visit will
enable the two countries to enhance bilateral cooperation in
various fields such transport and communications, commerce, human
resources, agriculture and judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Kagame said he is looking forward to the acceptance of Rwanda
in the East African Community, for which his country had already
applied.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandese President said that his delegation includes
businessmen from Rwanda who are here to learn from Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
This is Kagame's second visit to Kenya in two months since he
became the head of state in April this year.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Says No Compromise to Please Donors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will never
compromise its independence and national dignity to please some
donors or creditors, President Benjamin Mkapa told the parliament
in the central town of Dodoma on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Much as we badly need foreign financial aid and loans, we are
not prepared to let our independence and national dignity be the
price for aid and loans," the president said in a farewell address
to the House.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly, the parliament of Tanzania, is to be
dissolved in August to pave the way for the general elections to
be held on October 29.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, however, Mkapa thanked various donors and
creditors for supporting the country's economic and social
development programs, including the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) for giving the country hefty
debt reliefs.
</P>
<P>
The government has in the last five years won the confidence of
many donors and creditors without compromising the country's
independence and national dignity, he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned of the emerging habit of some political parties to go
abroad in search of financial aid or send complaints to donor
countries on issues that could be solved domestically.
</P>
<P>
According to Mkapa, his government needs foreign support to
ensure the freedom and fairness in the forthcoming general
elections, but not assistance aimed at strengthening a particular
political party or destroying any party.
</P>
<P>
"We are welcoming election observers, but not supervisors and
tutors of democracy," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are a free nation. Nobody outside Tanzania gave us the
right to vote. We secured the right ourselves after struggling for
the independence of Tanganyika and the gallant Zanzibar Revolution,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that despite various difficulties,
including drought and floods, Tanzania's economy is doing well and
registering impressive growth.
</P>
<P>
The economy grew at more than 4 percent, while inflation was
brought down to 6.6 percent as of May this year from around 30
percent in 1995, he said.
</P>
<P>
The coming elections will be Tanzania's second multi-party
election. Mkapa is seeking reelection for a second five-year term.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Calls for Urgent Steps to Save Children from AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
President Nelson Mandela Friday called for urgent steps to protect
the country's children from the HIV/AIDS scourge.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking while receiving a 35-million-rand (about 5
million U.S. dollars) grant from the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID) to support AIDS orphans in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Unless the spread of HIV/AIDS is curbed, the epidemic would be
worsened, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Mandela, children seem to bear the brunt of nature
's anger and men's misfortunes. "No one can dispute the need for
us to respond to those who need help most," he said.
</P>
<P>
The number of orphans in South Africa is currently estimated to
be between 500,000 and 800,000 and by 2005 the figure could be as
high as 1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
No government, not even the South African government, could
fight the disease by itself, Mandela said, stressing that "it
needs a concerted effort."
</P>
<P>
Mandela urged the South African government to take bold
initiatives to prevent new infections among young people and to
initiate large-scale action to prevent mother-to-child
transmission.
</P>
<P>
The USAID grant is aimed to cater for programs to address the
socio-economic needs of orphans and vulnerable children affected
and infected by HIV/AIDS.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Ex-King's Envoys to Talk with Pakistani Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 14 (Xinhua) -- A high level delegation of
former Afghan king Zahir Shah is scheduled to be here on Monday
for talks with Pakistani officials over the "Loya Jirga" (Grand
Assembly) proposal, a peace initiative for ending the protracted
Afghan conflict.
</P>
<P>
Hedayat Amin Arsala, former Afghan foreign minister, who will
lead the delegation, has already arrived in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Arsala told reporters here on his arrival Friday that the
delegation plans to meet Pakistani officials to explain the Loya
Jirga approach.
</P>
<P>
"We plan to explain the Jirga process as a means of promoting
peace process in the war-shattered Afghanistan to seek Pakistan's
support," he said.
</P>
<P>
Former autocrat Zahir Shah, who is on exile, has recently
proposed to hold a Loya Jirga, namely an assembly of
representatives from all Afghan factions, to find a peaceful
solution to the long-running civil war in the country.
</P>
<P>
Arsala said a delegation will also be sent to Afghanistan for
talks with the ruling Taliban militia and the northern opposition
alliance United Front. "We hope that the delegation will be able
to convince both sides about the need for peace and the wisdom of
the Jirga approach."
</P>
<P>
He said they hope the Jirga to be held inside Afghanistan. "
However, where exactly the Jirga will be held depends on our
discussions with the Taliban and the United Front. What is
important is, however, that the Loya Jirga is absolutely free and
is not under the control of any of the warring sides," he added.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Ruling Party Challenges Verdict of Coup in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistan Muslim League (PML),
the former ruling party, Friday filed a review petition in the
Supreme Court, challenging the court's May 12 judgment which
legitimized the military takeover last year.
</P>
<P>
The petition was filed by Bilahi Buksh Soomro, the speaker of
the suspended National Assembly, Raja Zafar ul Haq, number two in
PML second to jailed ex-premier Nawaz Sharif, and Chaudhry Pervez
Elahi, speaker of the suspended assembly of Punjab province,
sources from the Supreme Court said here.
</P>
<P>
The petition argued that the Supreme Court verdict was contrary
to the spirit of the constitution and validation of the military
takeover was not correct.
</P>
<P>
On May 12, an 11-member bench of the apex court judged
unanimously that the military coup on October 12, 1999, which led
to the dismissal of Sharif's government, was valid because it was
an act of necessity. The court also empowered Chief Executive
General Pervez Musharraf to amend the consitution.
</P>
<P>
The 18-page review petition said the doctrine of necessity
could be used as a basis for "derailing democracy."
</P>
<P>
It also opposed the Supreme Court observation of giving the
right of amendment in the constitution to General Musharraf,
saying that the court itself does not have the right of amending
the constitution and therefore it could not delegate the power to
the military government.
</P>
<P>
Wasim Sajjad, chairman of suspended Senate, will be the PML
counsel in the hearing about the petition while former minister of
law Khalid Anwar will assist him.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Angola, through a newly installed
Sea Satellite Control System, has in the past six months recorded
31 violations by industrial fishing boats poaching into its waters,
the official news agency Angop reported here on Friday .
</P>
<P>
The Angolan Ministry of Fisheries was quoted as saying that the
violators, including both foreign and local ship operators, have
been charged.
</P>
<P>
The new system allowed the localization of ships' position,
speed and directions, through the "blue box" installed aboard the
ships. So far, the concerned department in charge of the combat
against illegal fishing activities has installed the satellite
control system in 54 fishing boats and other boats will be fitted
soon.
</P>
<P>
Angola is one of the major fish producers in Africa, with the
output at some 202,000 tons in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The country has fishing cooperation agreements with the
European Union, Russia and some Asian countries, but illegal
fishing activities has affected its fish production.

<HEADLINE> IAS Calls International AIDS Conference Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"In Durban we had the chance to increase our knowledge
regarding the way to contrast HIV/AIDS by listening to a series of
excellent contributions coming from the western and eastern world,
and to share awareness and best practice from the North and South,
" said IAS outgoing president Mark Wainberg.
</P>
<P>
New IAS president Stefano Vella agreed. "Staying here in Africa
we were able to catch the world's attention towards the AIDS
pandemic, that could reach the dimension of a real catastrophe in
other continents as well," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the conference had focused more on the social and
behavioral impact of AIDS than on scientific research, but the
level of science presented is still "cutting-edge".
</P>
<P>
Both Vella and Wainberg agreed that the historic Durban
conference had run "smoothly in a safe and warm atmosphere".
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 delegates took home the message from the 13th
AIDS conference that there was proof that the use of a combination
of anti-retroviral drugs to fight HIV had been successful.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wainberg said IAS is committed itself to holding
future international AIDS conferences in poorer countries, but the
developing world will have to wait until the 2006 host is
announced.
</P>
<P>
The 2002 meeting will be held in Barcelona, Spain and the 2004
conference in Toronto, Canada.
</P>
<P>
However, Vella said he was angry with colleagues who did not
attend the conference because of perceived security threats and
the distance, noting that some scientists apparently opted not to
attend the event because they thought it would not be scientific
enough.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the 13th International AIDS Conference was
reportedly 60 million rand (8.8 million U.S. dollars).

<P>
This number was based on the findings of the various study

Officials with the commission said that signs of another round

According to the officials, 400,000 tons of grain out of the
previously pledged 784,000 tons has reached the country.
</P>

However, the available stock amounting to 83,000 tons is too

NAIROBI, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan and Ugandan youths
have vowed to strengthen their traditional ties and fight all
forms of divisionism, Rwanda News Agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Attending a meeting in the Ugandan capital Kampala, youth
representatives from both countries stressed the need to fight all
poor political ideologies that promote conflicts in the two
countries and the Great Lakes Region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
They also showed their commitment to fight the deadly disease
AIDS, which has claimed a big number of youths hence retarding

The Rwanda-Uganda youths conference came after the two heads of

<P>
The two countries have strengthened their relations after the

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for Solidarity Within OPEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Saturday called on member
countries of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) to strengthen their solidarity and avoid influences from
outside.
</P>
<P>
OPEC countries must be strong and firm and exercise solidarity
in order to keep oil price and output at a justifiable level,
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami told visiting Venezuelan Oil
Minister Ali Rodriguez and head of the Venezuelan Presidential
Commission Jose Valero.
</P>
<P>
Khatami warned that some countries outside the organization have
a plot to widen the gap between oil supply and demand, so all OPEC
members should support the consensus and decisions made within the
group to avoid being influenced by outsiders.
</P>
<P>
"I believe there are hands at work to prepare the ground for
tilting the balance between supply and demand, hence inflicting
irreparable damage on oil producers through sudden fall in the
price," Khatami was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency
(IRNA) as saying.
</P>
<P>
He added that OPEC members must counter the "politically
motivated" plot through solidarity so that oil production and price
could be kept at a justifiable level.
</P>
<P>
Khatami also reiterated Iran's support for all OPEC strategies,
expressing hope that consolidation of the member countries would
ensure stable and fixed oil prices, which is beneficial to both
producing and consuming countries.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting, the Iranian president thanked Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez for inviting him to attend the OPEC summit to
be held in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas in September. He said
the summit should open new horizon for stabilizing oil price, thus
serving the economic progress of member states.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan officials, who arrived here Saturday to
coordinate stances on the holding of the OPEC summit, also met with
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting, Kharrazi said oil price rises in the world
market are transitory and mainly caused by psychological propaganda
and the stock market. He said the OPEC should adopt long-term
decisions and regulate oil supply in line with market requirements.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also called for closer cooperation between
Venezuela and Iran in the energy sector to help OPEC's standing
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Rodriguez, currently the OPEC president, held
separate talks with his Iranian counterpart Bijan Namdar Zanganeh.
</P>
<P>
Both officials stressed that the current high price level is
mainly attributed to market perception and speculation and logistic
problems, and that production increases by the OPEC actually cannot
solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
The international demands are mainly sweet and light (low
sulfur) crude, while additional supplies of crude oil from OPEC
member countries will continue to be on the side of heavy and sour
(high sulfur) crude, Rodriguez and Zanganeh noted.
</P>
<P>
This has resulted in the widening of the differentials between
sweet and sour crude, a problem that can not be solved by OPEC,
they added.
</P>
<P>
They praised the collective adherence of OPEC member states to
their decisions and promised to guarantee full commitment to all
agreements, including the one adopted at their ministerial meeting
in Vienna in June, which resulted in a collective output increase
of 708,000 barrels per day.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Expert Calls for Greater Use of Micropower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The kind of highly reliable
power needed for today's economy can only be based on a new
generation of micropower devices now coming on the market,
according to a new report from the Worldwatch Institute, a
Washington, D.C.-based research organization.
</P>
<P>
These allow homes and businesses to produce their own
electricity, with far less pollution.
</P>
<P>
"Today's giant coal and nuclear power plants are failing to
provide the high-quality, reliable electricity needed to power the
new digital economy," said Seth Dunn, author of "Micropower: The
Next Electrical Era."
</P>
<P>
The new micropower technologies, which include fuel cells,
microturbines, and solar roofing, are as small as one-millionth
the scale of today's coal or nuclear plants, and produce little if
any of the air pollution of their larger cousins.
</P>
<P>
Already, the multi-billion-dollar potential of the market for
micropower has sent investors scrambling to buy into some of the
new companies, sending their share prices soaring earlier this
year, said Dunn.
</P>
<P>
Small-scale generators have numerous advantages over large-
scale power plants. Located to where they are used, small-scale
units can save electricity consumers millions of dollars by
avoiding costly new investments in central power plants and
distribution systems.
</P>
<P>
Micropower can also save homeowners and businesses millions of
dollars by lowering the threat of power outages and subsequent
lost productivity.
</P>
<P>
Use of more efficient combustion-based micropower systems,
relying primarily on natural gas, will substantially lower
emissions of particulates, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and
heavy metals. These reductions would range from 50 to 100 percent,
depending on the technology and pollutant.
</P>
<P>
More importantly, micropower will allow developing countries to
leapfrog to power sources that are cheaper and cleaner than
building more coal or nuclear plants and extending existing
transmission lines. Many of these countries lose the equivalent of
20 to 50 percent of their total power generated through leaks in
their transmission and distribution systems.
</P>
<P>
Power interruptions due to the vulnerability of central power
plants and transmission lines cost the United States alone as much
as 80 billion U.S. dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
Dunn estimated some 1.7 trillion U.S. dollars of capital
investment in new power capacity is projected to take place in
developing countries over the 20 years.
</P>
<P>
"These nations have a golden opportunity to get the rules right
the first time, and set up markets that support power systems
suitable for the 21st century and not the 20th," concluded Dunn.

<HEADLINE> Strong Winds Cause Damage, Panic in Panama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Strong winds of up to 60
kilometers per hour have lashed the Boca del Toro and Cocle
provinces in the west of Panama, causing material damage and panic
among the local population.
</P>
<P>
The gale-force wind, which lasted about one hour and spun like
a whirlpool, was accompanied by a strong rain that raised the
level of the Almirante and Changuinola rivers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The strong wind and rain also caused the suspension of electric
supply and of land communication in several zones of these regions,
ripped the roofs of many houses, razed banana cultivation, and
toppled trees and electric line poles.
</P>
<P>
The wind raised high wavers in the Almirante Bay, impeding
navigation.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian authorities warned Saturday that steady rains
are expected in all parts of the country in the next days and
recommended people who live in the center of the country to avoid
crossing rivers in these days because it is very dangerous and
causes mishaps as it has happened in previous occasions.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Consultative Council Amends 1956 Election Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's Shura (Consultative) Council
on Saturday approved amendments to the election law passed in 1956
in a bid to ensure the parliamentary elections to be monitored by
judges.
</P>
<P>
The council, under speaker Mustafa Kamal Helmi, unanimously
endorsed the amendments according to a republican decree issued by
President Hosni Mubarak on Wednesday, Egypt's official Middle East
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The council does not have legislative powers and only issues
policy recommendations.
</P>
<P>
The modifications came following a ruling by the Supreme
Constitutional Court a week ago that the 1956 law was
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
Under Egypt's constitution, all the polling stations for
parliamentary elections should be supervised by members of the
judiciary. But the 1956 law allows civil servants to oversee
smaller booths while demanding the principal stations be monitored
by members of the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
The country's opposition parties have long been charging that
the government has relentlessly rigged parliamentary elections and
calling for changes.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak called on Wednesday for emergency meetings of the Shura
Council and the People's Assembly (parliament) to introduce the
modifications to the 1956 law.
</P>
<P>
The assembly is due to take a similar decision on Sunday after
its Legislative and Constitutional Committee endorsed the
amendments on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is expected to hold parliamentary elections in November.
Its last elections were in 1995.

dollars to finalize a power grid as the prelude of developing the
Palestinian infrastructure. Both sides also decided to establish a
Czech-Palestinian businessmen council.
</P>
<P>
Twenty five Arab and foreign nations have opened representative
offices in Ramallah since the PNA was founded in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King, Iraqi Vice President Discuss Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
on Saturday met with Iraqi Vice President Taha Yasin Ramadan who is
visiting the kingdom to promote bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Their talks touched upon ways of consolidating bilateral
economic cooperation to alleviate the impact of the decade-old
international sanctions on Iraq, Jordan's official news agency
Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Ramadan reviewed the situation in Iraq under
the embargo imposed on Iraq since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, and
voiced appreciation for Jordan's support for Iraq during the years
of embargo, Petra said without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
King Abdullah and Jordanian officials have used all possible
occasions to call for an end to the internationals sanctions on
Iraq, which Baghdad said had resulted in the deaths of over 1.5
million people, most of whom were children and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan arrived in Amman Friday evening on a two day visit at a
time when officials from the two countries are eyeing for closer
economic cooperation and hoping to increase bilateral trade volume
to 800 million U.S. dollars from the current 300 million dollars
each year.
</P>
<P>
Jordan managed to keep its traditional friendly ties with Iraq
though it had taken drastic measures to improve its relations with
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, Iraq's main Arab foes.
</P>
<P>
Currently Iraq is the only oil and oil product supplier to
Jordan, providing 50,000 to 75,000 barrels of crude oil a day to
Amman at discounted prices, or less than half of the current price
on international markets.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom sided with Iraq during the Gulf crisis that was
sparked by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and had been isolated by Gulf
states, particularly Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes Declaration of G-8 Foreign Ministerial Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi on Saturday expressed welcome to the stance
adopted by the recent Group of Eight (G-8) foreign ministerial
meeting on the country.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said the moderate wording of the G-8 declaration indicates
a realistic attitude adopted by the group regarding Iran, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The developments in Iran arise from the national will of the
Iranian people, he said, and the international community should
consider the rights of the nations to determine their own fate and
the principle of the non-intervention in other states' internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Asefi also called on the international community to get involved
in a constructive cooperation with the countries which try to
promote their positive roles on national and international levels.
</P>
<P>
Thanking the G-8 foreign ministers for their consideration of
Iran's efforts to stop drug trafficking via its territory, he also
called on the international community to more actively cooperate
with Iran to suppress the illicit traffic in drugs.
</P>
<P>
It is impossible to definitively curb the drug problem without
adopting a global strategy to counter it, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian spokesman also brushed aside the West's concern on
Iran's stance over the Middle East peace process, terrorism and
weapons of mass destruction, the main hurdles for Iran to improve
relations with the Western countries, particularly the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Iran believes that the only best solution to the Middle East
crisis is to give the Palestinians all their legitimate rights, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Iran has strongly opposed the Middle East peace process and
rejected to recognize the Israeli regime, which was labeled by Iran
as "usurper of Islamic and Arab lands."
</P>
<P>
Terming Iran as a victim of international terrorism, Asefi
stressed that Tehran calls for serious dealing with "all forms of
the evil phenomenon of terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Rejecting the allegation on Iran's efforts to get access to
weapons of mass destruction, he said Iran has acceded to the
international treaties on the non-proliferation of the mass
destruction weaponry and it has always tried to help create a world
free from the arms of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Iran's atomic installations have been times and again checked by
the nuclear international agencies which approved of the peaceful
purposes of its nuclear plans, he added.
</P>
<P>
G-8 foreign ministers held a two-day meeting in the southwestern
Japanese city of Miyazaki on Wednesday and Thursday in preparation
for the G-8 summit in Okinawa later this month.
</P>
<P>
The statement of the meeting focuses on disarmament and nuclear
nonproliferation, United Nations reforms, fight against
international organized crime and terrorism, the environment and
regional security issues.
</P>
<P>
The G-8 countries are Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, the United States and Russia.

<HEADLINE> 1,000 Congolese Refugees Enter Tanzania Monthly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 15 (Xinhua) -- An average of some 1,000
refugees from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) continue
to enter Tanzania's western Kigoma region each month in a bid to
flee fierce fighting between the rebel and government forces.
</P>
<P>
Marion Roche, head of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) sub-office in Kigoma, said on Saturday that the
flow of refugees from the DRC has been pretty much the same since
the end of last year despite the pullout of Rwandan and Ugandan
troops from the northeastern DRC city of Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the refugees who enter Kigoma still talk of fighting
in Congo," she said.
</P>
<P>
The official quoted refugees from Kisangani as saying that
stray bullets regularly fall over the town, with thousands of
rockets flying in all directions.
</P>
<P>
But the flow of Burundi refugees into Tanzania is generally in
decline although the cause can not be immediately explained, she
said.
</P>
<P>
She said that "refugees from Burundi say there is still
fighting in some parts of the country, and most of the refugees we
get are from border towns."
</P>
<P>
According to latest statistics issued by the Tanzanian
government, the country is currently sheltering around 664,000
refugees fleeing from Burundi, the DRC, Rwanda and Somalia due to
unstable situations in these countries.

million rials (37.73 million U.S. dollars) from 127.2 million rials
(33.92 million dollars) in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The financial results of the bank showed a constant increase in
the contribution of the service charges and fees which amounted to

by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Saturday in Comilla district, some
100 kilometers southeast to the capital city Dhaka, the official
Bangladesh News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
While laying the foundation of the much-awaited Comilla Export
Processing Zone, the prime minister said it would usher in
economic development and prosperity not only for the district, but
also for the country as a whole.
</P>
<P>
To be built on 258 acres adjacent to Comilla Airport, the
Comilla EPZ will create jobs for over 40,000 people on completion.
Some 208 industrial plots will be set up in the Comilla EPZ, of
which works on 40 are to be completed in the first phase.
</P>
<P>
The development works for infrastructure began in April last
year with an estimated cost of 835.6 million taka (16 million U.S.
dollars), and the first-phase works are expected to be finished in
2001, the authorities said, hoping that 3.6 billion taka (69.2
million dollars) will be invested when operations go in full swing.
</P>
<P>
Besides, goods worth 5.9 billion taka (113.46 million dollars)
would be exported from the Comilla EPZ every year, 25 percent of
which would be earned as value-added taxes, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh now has three export processing zones. Chittagong
EPZ, the first EPZ in the country, started its operation in 1983.
In 1993, another EPZ was set up in Dhaka, the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Investment in Chittagong EPZ has reached 283 million dollars,
while investment in Dhaka EPZ stands at 144 million dollars as on
June 30, 2000.
</P>
<P>
During the last four years, the investment in both EPZs has
increased by 22 percent on an average, and the average growth rate
of export stands at 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
Foundation stone of the third EPZ was laid in 1998 in Mongla, a
southwestern port city in the country, the construction work of
which is going on in full swing.
</P>
<P>
With the successful operation of the Chittagong and Dhaka EPZs,
the present government has also decided to set up another two EPZs
in northern districts for balanced regional development of the
country.

<HEADLINE> McGrady to Sign Contract with Orlando Magic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Free agent Tracy McGrady, who
was courted by three NBA teams in the past week, said Friday that
he is choosing the Orlando Magic because he wants to play close to
home.
</P>
<P>
"Not too many superstars get a chance to play at home, and I
just saw myself taking advantage of it," McGrady said at the
Disney Wide World of Sports Complex, Florida where he works out.
</P>
<P>
The native of Auburndale, Florida, about 40 miles southwest of
Orlando, will likely sign a six-year deal worth 67.5 million US
dollars until August 1.
</P>
<P>
McGrady averaged 15.4 points and 6.3 rebounds last season with
the Toronto Raptors.
</P>
<P>
He said free agent forward Grant Hill's commitment to the Magic
earlier this month was a crucial factor in his decision.
</P>
<P>
"I think we're capable of turning this organization around in
the right way," said McGrady, 21, "I like their style of play and
I think my talent, to the team, just helps it out a lot."
</P>
<P>
McGrady also said he likes the style of Orlando coach Doc
Rivers, the NBA's coach of the year last season.
</P>
<P>
"I think Doc is a player's coach," he said, "For a young guy as
myself, you need guys like that who really care about you."

<HEADLINE> Putin's China Visit Helps Cooperation: Ambassador (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin's
upcoming state visit to China will combine the goodwill of decades
of Sino-Russian friendship with the promise of wider-ranging
bilateral relations in the future, according to the Russian
ambassador to China.
</P>
<P>
"For Russia, China is not only a global power, but a great
neighbor and an important partner in Asia," Igor Rogachev said in
a recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He quoted President Putin as saying that Russia gives priority
to developing its strategic partnership of coordination with China.
</P>
<P>
President Putin will pay his first state visit to China on July
18, as a guest of Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Describing the personal relationship between President Putin
and Chinese President Jiang Zemin as that of "new partners and old
friends," the ambassador said that President Jiang was the first
foreign leader to congratulate Putin on his victory in the Russian
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
In addition to a meeting between President Jiang and President
Putin in the Five-Nation Summit in Dushanbe, the capital city of
Tajikistan in early July, the two leaders will meet in Beijing
again soon.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they will also have the opportunities to meet on two
other occasions this year, at the millennium summit of heads of
state to be held in the UN headquarters, and at an informal
meeting of leaders of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
in Brunei.
</P>
<P>
"Frequent contacts between top leaders of the two countries can
be seen as a continuation of the constructive development of
bilateral relations," Rogachev said.
</P>
<P>
Former Russian President Boris Yeltsin, in his eight years in
the Kremlin, established and maintained a good relationship with
the Chinese leadership. President Putin has succeeded in the
tradition of his predecessor. "This shows that Russia will
strengthen political dialogue with the Chinese leaders," Rogachev
said.

<P>
As a veteran China hand, Rogachev has witnessed the ups and
downs of Sino-Russian relations. In the eight years he has served
as Russian ambassador to China, Sino-Russian relations have
developed steadily.
</P>
<P>
"It is an unchangeable foreign policy of Russia to promote a
strategic partnership of coordination with China," he said, adding
that this policy has been endorsed by main social and political
forces in Russia.
</P>
<P>
During Putin's visit to China, according to the ambassador,
leaders of the two countries are expected to discuss bilateral
cooperation in a variety of areas.
</P>
<P>
Also on the agenda of the presidential talks will be matters
concerning strategic stability in the Asia-Pacific region and the
world at large, the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Trade volume between the two countries exceeded 5.7 billion U.S.
dollars last year, an increase of 4.4 percent over a year ago, he
said, adding that the figure in the first five months of this year
increased by 17 percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Of that amount, trade volume between Russia and such northeast
China's provinces as Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning increased by
30 percent. China is now the sixth-largest trading partner of
Russia.
</P>
<P>
"Russia hopes to participate in the development of China's west
by offering high-tech, equipment and energy," he said. Broad
prospects exist for bilateral cooperation in pipelines, nuclear
energy, machinery, aviation, metallurgy and ship-building, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that Sino-Russian economic and trade cooperation needs
to be on an even keel with the political relations of the
countries, thus laying a solid groundwork for the further growth
of bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Reformist Lawyers Go on Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Two reformist lawyers, Mohsen Rahami
and Shirin Ebadi, went on trial at Branch 16 of Tehran's public
court on Saturday, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The two lawyers, arrested last month, have been accused by the
conservative judiciary of involvement in duplicating and
distributing a videocassette that included "insulting" remarks on
some ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
A source in Tehran's justice department said the trial was held
in camera because of "some documents related to the case that
involve the national security."
</P>
<P>
Rahami, a professor of law at Tehran University, and Ms. Ebadi,
a feminist pro-democracy lawyer, have represented various reformist
clients in high-profile cases.
</P>
<P>
Since the landslide victory of Iranian reformers in February's
parliamentary election, the conservative establishment has never
stopped efforts to crack down on the growing reformist movement.
</P>
<P>
In addition to partially annulling parliamentary election
results, the powerful conservatives have also closed down some 18
reformist papers and journals and arrested a number of journalists
and reformist activists on accusations of violating Islamic values.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Ministries Protest Court Verdict on Dorm Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Ministry of Science, Research
and Technology and Ministry of Health and Medical Education on
Saturday protested a recent court verdict issued by the
conservative judiciary on the police attack on Tehran University
dormitory last year.
</P>
<P>
The two ministries in charge of the country's higher education
underlined in a joint statement the need for restoration of the
rights of students, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Acquittal of those accused in the Tehran University dormitory
case raises question about the identity of the real culprits and
agents responsible for beating and injuring students as well as
damaging academic centers, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the event, called as "catastrophe and crime" by the
supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and a "national case" by
President Mohammad Khatami, should have been subject to serious and
fair legal and judicial investigation.
</P>
<P>
The scope of financial and spiritual damage done to the
scientific sector can only be evaluated on a national scale and in
connection with national interests and security, the ministries
underlined.
</P>
<P>
The branch 7 of the Tehran military court on Tuesday acquitted
the former commander of Tehran security forces (police) Brigadier
General Farhad Nazari along with 17 other police officers charged
with attacking Tehran University dormitory.
</P>
<P>
The riot police forced into Tehran University dormitory in July
last year, storming student hostels and beating students, following
a student protest against press restrictions.
</P>
<P>
The police attack sparked a six-day political unrest in the
Iranian capital, the worst since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. At
least one died and many others were injured in the riots.
</P>
<P>
Iran's leading reformist party, the Islamic Iran Participation
Front (IIPF), has also criticized the conservative judiciary for
acquitting the main suspects in the dormitory case.
</P>
<P>
The recently-issued court verdict not only failed to meet public
expectations but also disappointed jurists, said the party in an
open letter to the judiciary chief Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi
Shahroudi.

WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- A Miami jury Friday ordered the tobacco industry to pay 145
billion U.S. dollars to hundreds of thousands of Florida smokers
suffering from diseases caused by cigarettes. But the tobacco
industry immediately vowed to appeal the verdict, and lawyers
predicted that their companies would never pay a dime in the case.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Senate Friday passed a bill that would eliminate
the federal estate tax. The bill would gradually repeal the tax
levied on an estate after a person dies.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Senate voted Friday to repeal the federal estate
tax, brushing aside a veto threat from President Clinton and
giving Republicans at least a symbolic victory on an issue at the
top of their election-year agenda.
</P>
<P>
-- In a striking victory for the government, an advisory panel
of five jurors tool slightly more than an hour Friday to find that
federal officials were not liable in the deaths of nearly 80
Branch Davidians who were killed in the 1993 raid and standoff at
the sect's compound near Waco.

<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin said that
the war industry should be closely linked with other industries so
that a vigorous national defense system based on science and
technology can be formed.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks Friday night in Beijing when visiting a
demonstration of war industry achievements, accompanied by vice-
president Hu Jintao and other central and military leaders.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly can make some creations in the fields of world
advanced science and technology so long as we make unified and
dedicated efforts," said Jiang, who is also chairman of the
Central Military Commission.
</P>
<P>
Leadership and coordination should be strengthened to achieve
good results in technological innovation and personnel training in
a move to promote science and technology in both the war industry
and the national economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
He asked the war industry to closely link itself with other
industries, as the nation's defense building depends on the nation
's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Linking science and research institutions of the war industry
with those of other industries should be encouraged so that their
joint results can be better used for national defense and economic
development, he said.

<HEADLINE> Analysis: Technology Sector Jewel in China's Crown (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Rising from a low base, the
information technology (IT) sector in China will continue to grow
at a phenomenal pace with hardware sales spearheading growth.
</P>
<P>
The comment came from analysts after the recent drop in share
price in the global tech, media and telecom (TMT) sector pushed
the share prices of the China-listed tech companies down to more
attractive levels.
</P>
<P>
"The fastest-growing sector that drives the country's economy
adds the jewel to China's Crown," said Belle Chan, senior
technology analyst with Salomon Smith Barney (SSB), one of the
world's leading investment bank and broker-dealer under the U.S.-
based Citigroup Inc.
</P>
<P>
On fundamentals, the tech sector in China remains strong,
enjoying robust growth from consumption recovery and rising
Internet usage, and the companies have competent management, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Chan, also SSB's vice-president and technology research analyst
focusing on Hong Kong and China companies in its Asia Pacific
Equity Research Center, said they made the predictions because
they have perceived that the Chinese government's support
continues to play a decisive role in nurturing IT hubs and China's
entry to WTO should bring in rising foreign investment and
technology know-how.
</P>
<P>
A recent report on China's technology revealed by SSB
researchers showed that the IT sector in China has emerged
spectacularly over the past decade with the total IT sales rising
to 174 billion RMB yuan (21.21 billion U.S. dollars) in 1999 from
a mere 5 billion yuan (609 million U.S. dollars) in 1990. Of the
total, hardware represents 78 percent, and software and services
make up the balance.
</P>
<P>
"We expect hardware sales will continue to rise as a result of
a consumption recovery in China coupled with rising Internet usage,
" Chan said.

Recent monthly sales statistics indicated that PCs are one of
the fastest-growing consumer products. Given the limitations of
the existing infrastructure, PCs are likely to remain the first
choice for Internet-access devices in the short to medium term
until access infrastructure is improved via cable and WAP, he said.
</P>
<P>
The report also showed that overseas-funded firms with advanced
technology know-how have been the locomotive for the development
of the Chinese IT industry, accounting for 23 percent of IT
operations on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the concern that local players would lose their
competitiveness once import tariffs are reduced when China enters
the WTO, Otto Wong, managing director and head of SSB's Asia
Pacific Equity Research Center, said that they believed this
concern is overblown.
</P>
<P>
In fact, over the past few years, the Chinese government has
already cut tariffs on imported electronic goods, suggesting the
tariff rate is not the determining factor in PC sales, Wong added.
</P>
<P>
Successful pricing strategies have enabled local players to
dominate the low-priced desktop market, and local manufacturers
are also making inroads into the value-added market, with products
such as notebooks and servers, Wong noted.
</P>
<P>
With their extensive distribution networks, products customized
for the Chinese market and comprehensive after-sales service,
local vendors enjoy a comprehensive advantage over multinational
corporations in the mainland market, the managing director added.
</P>
<P>
Based on the sum-of-the-parts valuations, the SSB analysts said
they saw a rose future for the China-listed IT companies,
including Great Wall Technology, Legend, Founder and TCL.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are the economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey's state-owned railway car maker Tuvasas, based
in the northwestern province of Adapazari, is seeking to merge with
a foreign company due to financial difficulties, reported Turkish
Daily News on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The factory, damaged by the devastating earthquake on August 17
last year, has stopped production since then and is merely doing
repair and maintenance, said Tuvasas General Manager Mehmet
Gokturk.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We are seeking a foreign partner because we have to
compete with global giants. We are going to do whatever it takes to
push Tuvasas forward."
</P>
<P>
The earthquake has rendered 65 percent of the factory non-
operational. Tuvasas employs 1,182 workers and 427 civil servants.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Syria is seeking the installation of a passenger train
between Tehran and Damascus via the Turkish capital Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Ayad Gazal, chief of Syrian Railways, made the proposal
in a meeting with his Iranian counterpart Rahman Dadman in Tehran,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian official, who arrived here Friday for a week-long
visit, also expressed hope to make use of Iran's railway technology
in the construction of three express lines in his country.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- A European Commission proposal on July 12 to eliminate
all remaining restrictions on imports of 62 categories of textiles
and clothing products from the European Union (EU) countries by
January 1, 2002 will likely aggravate competition for Turkish
exporters.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Istanbul Textile and Ready-to-Wear Exporters
Union Nuri Artok told the paper that "Turkey faces a price
disadvantage, its products are more expensive."
</P>
<P>
"But it has advantages too, which it should maintain and
enhance. Turkey's geographical proximity, fast-track service,
ability to produce rich quality and sophisticated goods make it a
lucrative exporter to the EU."
</P>
<P>
Turkey's ready-to-wear exports in the first half of 2000 totaled
3.8 billion U.S. dollars and textile exports 1.3 billion dollars.
Out of these figures, 2.6 billion, or 67.2 percent, and 715
million, or 53.6 percent, worth of exports were sent to EU member
states.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Uzbek Labor Ministry has cancelled the working
licences of 21 Turkish firms working in Uzbekistan on the grounds
that they have not carried out legal requirements.
</P>
<P>
The companies were given six months to wind up their business
activities. The work permits of 66 Turkish citizens who have been
working in these firms have also been revoked.
</P>
<P>
Turkish companies are mostly working in industrial fields such
as textiles, cosmetics, food, furniture and leather.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The European Union (EU) has decided to lift the quotas
imposed on Turkey's textile exports to Europe.
</P>
<P>
EU will phase out the quotas from the year 2002 to 2005, said
Haluk Ozelci, EU representative of the Turkish Textile Ready-to-
Wear Exporters.
</P>
<P>
He said that the year 2005 will be important for Turkish textile
producers and the Turkish textile sector should re-structure itself
and get fully prepared for a new era.

Shahab-3 missile had been tested.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed source said the missile has been developed for
defense purposes and poses no threat to any other country.
</P>
<P>
The Shahab-3 missile is said to be an improved model of North
Korea's Nodong-1. Iran conducted the first test of the missile in
1998.

<HEADLINE> Former Pakistan Premier Facing Fresh Corruption Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's ousted prime minister
Nawaz Sharif is facing another corruption charge as a reference on
one of his estates was presented to the country's accountability
court Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has filed the
reference against the former premier and his parents in the Attock
Fort Accountability Court, which is located in the proximity of
Islamabad, reported the private agency News Network International.
</P>
<P>
The reference questions the source of income for Sharif's
residence at Raiwin near his hometown Lahore, which involved
estimated investment of 247 million rupees (4.7 million U.S.
dollars), the amount not mentioned in the tax returns of the
former prime minister.
</P>
<P>
According to the reference which bears 44 prosecution witnesses,
the construction area of the luxury Raiwind residence is over 5300
square meters with a basement of over 320 square meters. The two-
story building even has a lift.
</P>
<P>
Sharif has been sentenced to life imprisonment in a hijacking
case and being tried in a helicopter corruption case. He might be
tried in more corruption cases.
</P>
<P>
NAB Prosecutor General Farooq Adam Khan said last week that two
more references against the former prime minister, pertaining to a
sugar rebate deal and construction of Lahore-Islamabad motorway
respectively, were also in the pipeline.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Professors, Students Call for Ban on Fundamentalist Political Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Different student organizations and
distinguished professors Saturday urged the government to impose
ban on political activities of all fundamentalist political groups
including Jamaat-e-Islami and Islami Chhatra Shibir (Islamic
Students' Front) following their alleged involvement in Chittagong
massacre.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, five mid-ranking Bangladesh Chhatra League (
Bangladesh Students' League) leaders and two drivers were shot
dead in Chittagong by a group of gunmen of Islami Chhatra Shibir (
ICS), the student front of the Islamic fundamentalist Jamaat-e-
Islami.
</P>
<P>
Distinguished academician Professor Sirajul Islam Chowdhury of
Dhaka University termed the gruesome killings as one of the most
heinous incidents, saying the authorities should uproot their
unholy foundation and search for the root of their strength.
</P>
<P>
They should be dealt with iron hands and the civil society
should launch severe protest against the gruesome killings, the
professor stressed.
</P>
<P>
Strongly condemning the Chittagong massacre, President of
Samajtantrik Chhatra Front (Socialist Students' Front) Nurul Islam
in a statement said all religion-based political groups and
parties including Jammat-e-Islami and the ICS should be banned
immediately.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL) held a protest rally at Dhaka
University Saturday to protest against Wednesday's Chittagong
carnage, calling upon the pro-liberation progressive forces to
forge a strong resistance against the fundamentalist groups.
</P>
<P>
"They are misleading the people in the name of religion and
using religion to advance their petty party interest," the BCL
leaders said at the rally.

<HEADLINE> French Sea Festival Organizers Urge Release of Russian Yacht </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 15 (Xinhua)-- Organizers of an on-going sea
festival in the western French port of Brest Saturday called for
the release of a Russian yacht which has been detained by French
judicial authorities since Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse quoted the organizers of the festival,
Brest 2000, as saying that a hearing will be held Saturday by the
Tribunal of Grand Investigation of Brest.
</P>
<P>
Russian yacht "Sedov" was seized because of a lawsuit against
the Russian state by a Swiss import-export company, Noga, which
accused Russia of breaking a contract by refusing to pay 1.4
billion U.S. dollars for the food it sent to Russia in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The 117-meter, four-mast yacht belongs to the University of
Military Technology of Murmansk in northern Russia and has 176
people including 100 cadets of the university and 15 adolescents
from Moscow on board when it arrived in Brest at the invitation of
Brest 2000 organizers.
</P>
<P>
It was seized by the order of bailiffs of the French justice
because they considered the yacht as indirectly owned by the
Russian state, which owns the Murmansk Military Technology
University.
</P>
<P>
If France and Russia fail to reach an agreement on the dispute,
the yacht, which was built in 1921 by the German Krupp, could be
put on auction sale.
</P>
<P>
Russia has urged France to immediately release the yacht or
face serious damage to bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The French judicial authorities have already frozen some
banking accounts of the Russian diplomatic representations in
France in implementing a verdict by a Swedish court which
represented Noga and decided to seize the property of the Russian
state to pay for its debt to Noga.

<HEADLINE> Eight Killed, 70 Injured in Tornado Disaster in Western Canada EDS-Update with more information </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Eight people were killed and at
least 70 others injured Friday night when a Tornado hit a summer
campground in central Alberta, Canada.
</P>
<P>
According to latest reports from CTV and other Canadian media,
the tornado descended on the Green Acres campground at Pine Lake
around 7000 p.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of light-weight camping trailers were flipped upside
down and even tossed about like toys as the tornado touched down
to turn the campsite into a large pile of twisted metal and broken
wood.
</P>
<P>
There were hundreds of people walking around with scrapes,
bruises while people with serious injuries were being carried out
on strechers, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
"The fatalities are countless at this time. It looks like
something of a rescue camp right now," according to the broadcast
by a TV station in Red Deer, some 60 kilometers northwest of Pine
Lake, which is between the provincial capital Edmonton in the
north and another major city Calgary in the south.
</P>
<P>
Rescue teams have been sent out to the scene of the disaster
from both Edmonton and Calgary, while farmers within a 30-mile (50-
kilometer) radius are flooding the area doing what they can to
help.
</P>
<P>
Alberta Premier Ralph Klein was reported en route to the scene
to join fire, ambulance and emergency crews.
</P>
<P>
The injured were transported to hospitals in Calgary, Edmonton
and Red Deer while rescue divers and police dogs from Calgary were
called in to search for missing people.
</P>
<P>
Environment Canada said the weather system that had spawned the
tornado could be seen from Calgary, about 150 kilometers away.
</P>
<P>
The province was last hit by tornado in 1987, when 27 people
were killed and up to 300 others injured.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of Okinawans Protest Against Crimes by U.S. Servicemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- About 7,000 residents in Japan's
Okinawa Prefecture staged a rally Saturday to protest against two
crimes allegedly committed by U.S. servicemen earlier this month
and called for a reduced U.S. military presence in the prefecture,
the Kyodo News Service reported.
</P>
<P>
It was the largest anti-U.S. forces rally in Japan's
southernmost prefecture since over 85,000 locals demonstrated in
the wake of the rape of a 12-year-old schoolgirl by three U.S.
servicemen in September 1995.
</P>
<P>
On July 3, a U.S. Marine was arrested on suspicion of sexually
assaulting a 14-year-old girl, and a U.S. airman was apprehended
last Sunday in a suspected hit-and-run case.
</P>
<P>
A resolution adopted at the rally called on Washington and U.S.
forces to teach their servicemen about human rights and reduce the
number of troops on U.S. bases in Okinawa, Kyodo reported.
</P>
<P>
It also called for a radical revision of the Japan-U.S. Status
of Forces Agreement which defines the legal status of U.S.
military personnel in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The organizers said they intended to send the resolution to U.S.
President Bill Clinton before the Group of Eight (G-8) summit,
which is slated for July 21-23 in the semitropical island
prefecture, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Okinawan Diet (parliament) members, including ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) members, former Okinawa Governor Masahide
Ota and mayors of Naha and Ginowan, joined the rally in a park in
the southern Okinawa Island city of Ginowan in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"If the chief of the U.S. forces in Okinawa pledges to double
his efforts (to prevent such incidents), then he must reduce the
number of his troops here to half the current one," Suzuyo
Takazato, a representative of a local women's group against the
military, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The allegations involving the two U.S. servicemen caused an
uproar in Okinawa, where there is strong antipathy to the U.S.
military presence.
</P>
<P>
Residents were especially angered by the alleged assault of the
14-year-old girl, which revived memories of the 1995 rape.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa accounts for only 0.6 percent of Japan's land area but
has some 75 percent of the land occupied by U.S. military
facilities in Japan.

Jiaxuan and visiting Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov today
discussed a range of issues focusing on Sino-Russian relations,

China a major event in bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
During the two-hour talks held at the Diaoyutai State
Guesthouse here this afternoon, Tang said that both China and
Russia are influential countries in the world, and next week's
Sino-Russian summit would draw world attention.
</P>
<P>
President Putin's China visit will play an important role in
pushing forward the Sino-Russian strategic partnership in the 21st
century, according to an official from the Chinese foreign
ministry.
</P>
<P>
In the summit, leaders of the two countries are expected to
share in-depth exchanges on important international matters, and
their talks will have an immeasurable influence on Sino-Russian
coordination and cooperation in international affairs, the

<HEADLINE> Embargo Kills over 8,000 Iraqis in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The decade-old U.N. sanctions
against Iraq claimed lives of more than 8,000 Iraqis in June,
bringing the total number of victims to 1,324,760 since 1990, the
Iraqi Health Ministry announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a statement that 5,511 children under the
age of five died of diarrhea, pneumonia, respiratory infections and
malnutrition last month.
</P>
<P>
And 2,671 elderly people died of heart diseases, hypertension,
diabetes and malignant neoplasms.
</P>
<P>
Such a high mortality rate, due to malnutrition and severe
medicine shortage caused by the sanctions, was in sharp contrast
with the same month in 1989, when some 387 children and 434 elderly
people died.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly called on the U.N. to unconditionally lift
the stringent sanctions, imposed on it after its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
And Iraq has long accused the United States and Britain of
impeding the implementation of the U.N. oil-for-food program by
deliberately blocking contracts Iraq signed with foreign countries
to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
In December 1996, the U.N. started to implement the humanitarian
oil-for-food program in Iraq, which allows Iraq to sell limited
amount of oil every six months to buy humanitarian supplies for its
people reeling under the sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Hans Von Sponeck, former U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Iraq,
and Jutta Burghardt, former representative of the World Food
Program, resigned in February in protest against the continuing
sanctions and the worsening humanitarian situation in Iraq.

<P>
SINGAPORE, July 15 (Xinhua) --Singapore Minister for Education
Teo Chee Hean has affirmed that his ministry aims to recruit new
teachers from the top one-third of educated Singaporeans of each
cohort so as to achieve a good overall quality of his country's
teaching force.
</P>
<P>
The minister who doubles as the Second Minister for Defense
made the point at the 2nd Teaching Scholarship Presentation
Ceremony here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The government must make sure that the teaching service will
have some of the best of each cohort come into the teaching force,
he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry has invested substantially in teaching
scholarships and awards so as to attract the best young people to
come into teaching and make teaching an attractive career choice.
</P>
<P>
The number of the Ministry of Education (MOE) scholarships and
awards given out has doubled within the last three years from 133
in 1997 to 375 this year, he underlined.
</P>
<P>
He also said that his ministry has recruited 7,000 officers
over the last three years and this represents more than a quarter
of his country's teaching force of 23,500.
</P>
<P>
he noted that Singapore's teaching service has seen significant
improvements in pay, promotion prospects and professional
upgrading opportunities since 1996, citing MOE introduced new
intermediate grades to give teachers additional promotional
opportunities and a faster first promotion starting in January of
this year and the teaching service received an average 13 percent
increase in salaries since two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Teo also said that his country needs a new generation of
teachers to propel education system into 21st century, noting that
3,500 teachers now in their 50s will retire in the next five years,
accounting for 30 percent of the total teaching force.
</P>
<P>
The task ahead now is to ensure that the education system
continues to do well even as the more experienced ones retire, he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Board of Investment (BOI)
registered domestic and foreign direct investment to the tune of
12.5 billion U.S. dollars during the last four years, Executive
Chairman of BOI Mokammel Hossain said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting organized by the Federation of Bangladesh
Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI) to exchange views with
the British-Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce (BBCC), the BOI
chairman said 80 percent of the local investment and 50 percent of
the foreign direct investment are now under implementation.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing the importance of domestic investment which is
considered imperative to attract foreign investment, Mokammel said
the BOI registered domestic investment of 1.38 billion U.S.
dollars as of June this year.
</P>
<P>
In response to the demand of the BBCC delegation to simplify
the investment procedure, Mokammel said a non-resident Bangladeshi
cell in the BOI will be opened this month to facilitate investment.
</P>
<P>
He called upon the expatriate Bangladeshis in Britain to come
up with investment in the country especially in the field of the
information technology, power and catering service sectors through
corporate system.
</P>
<P>
While expressing the willingness to invest in the country, the

of investment.

<HEADLINE> Feature: "Snakeheads Almost Killed Me," Says Fujian Stowaway (3) </HEADLINE>

"But it was too early for us to be merry," Dong said. "Another
nightmare was waiting."
</P>
<P>
They drove for more than 20 hours non-stop. Dong said they
nearly suffocated in the close quarters.
</P>
<P>
"Several persons vomited and relieved themselves inside, making
the already turbid air even worse."
</P>
<P>
The van finally stopped in a forest, where several husky men
led them to a thatched hut. They slept on the floor and ate more
black dough. The next day, a Chinese and a Russian came to see
them, saying the only way out was to call their families in Fujian
to say they had arrived at their destinations and needed money.
</P>
<P>
"The snakeheads ordered us to tell our relatives to mail 200,
000 yuan to a certain account number, otherwise we would never
return home," Dong said.
</P>
<P>
When they refused to pay, they were beaten. Dong was knocked
unconscious.
</P>
<P>
From that day on, the captors threatened the group every day,
frequently inflicting serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
Ye Fang, a young woman from Fuzhou, said that the snakeheads
humiliated them in every way imaginable.
</P>
<P>
"Once they beat me, and my face was swollen and red for more
than a week," she said. "I am still suffering from a ringing in my
ears. Sometimes I can't hear."
</P>
<P>
Realizing that escape was the only way to freedom, they took
their chances one rainy night when their guards were asleep and
ran. At dawn they found themselves in Ukraine, where they
contacted the Chinese embassy. With its assistance they returned
to China on May 16, ending a four-month nightmare.
</P>
<P>
Police in Fujian investigated their stories and charged them
according to law. Dong was held by police for 15 days and fined 5,
000 yuan for illegally crossing the border into Russia.
</P>
<P>
"Snakeheads are liars," Dong said. "I will never be a stowaway
again."

In the following days, another eight Fujian people, including
four women each about 20 years old, were brought to the building.
</P>
<P>
All had the same story: Liu hoodwinked them into believing he
could get them out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Bitter temperatures chilled Moscow in December, and the group
was locked inside an unheated room with only worn-out blankets for
warmth. Several of the hostages suffered from frostbite.
</P>
<P>
"I almost died from the cold," Dong recalled.
</P>
<P>
For four months, the captives ate only pieces of blackish dough
made of wheat bran and sorghum. Exhaustion and malnutrition took
their toll. One man suffered from a severe stomach ailment, but
the snakeheads gave him no medicine.
</P>
<P>
The prison-like existence continued for months; occasionally
the captives were told their visas were being processed and they
should be patient.
</P>
<P>
To pass the time, Dong and the other eight people took turns
telling stories, but topics soon dried up and the room fell silent.

China hopes to continue to work with Canada and push their
overall cooperative partnership to a new high in the new century,
on the basis of mutual-respect, equality and mutual-benefit and
seeking similarity while reserving differences.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy said the Canadian government attaches importance to
developing friendly ties with China and will push bilateral
relations forward.
</P>
<P>
Tang also briefed Axworthy on China's principled stand on the
Taiwan issue. Axworthy reiterated that the Canadian government
will continue to follow the One-China policy and will never
develop official ties with Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Judiciary Under Fire for Verdict on Dorm Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 15 (Xinhua) -- One of Iran's leading reformist
parties, the Islamic Iran Participation Front (IIPF), has
criticized the conservative judiciary for acquitting the main
suspects in last year's student dormitory incident which sparked
nation-wide riots.
</P>
<P>
The court verdict on the university dorm case not only failed to
meet public expectations but also disappointed jurists, said the
party in an open letter to the judiciary chief, Ayatollah Mahmoud
Hashemi Shahroudi.
</P>
<P>
The official IRNA news agency reported on Saturday that the
party expressed regret over the so-called irregularities in the
court proceedings, noting the verdict on the dorm case may lead
people to doubt the effectiveness of the judiciary system in
restoring calm and security in the society.
</P>
<P>
The Branch Seven of Tehran's military court on Tuesday handed
down a verdict acquitting former chief of Tehran police, Farhad
Nazari, along with 17 other policemen of all charges against them
for forcibly entering a Tehran University dormitory on July 8 last
year.
</P>
<P>
The police raid on the students aimed to disperse protests
against press restrictions imposed by the conservative authorities,
but the clashes triggered six-day riots, the worst Iran has
experienced since the 1979 Islamic revolution. At least one people
died and many others injured in the riots.
</P>
<P>
The IIPF is led by President Mohammad Khatami's brother Mohammad
Reza Khatami, who is deputy speaker of the reformist-controlled
Majlis (parliament). The party and other reformist organizations
maintain that the dormitory case should be thoroughly investigated
and all those responsible be punished.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Hails Establishment of Diplomatic Ties With Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The establishment of diplomatic
relations between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
and the Philippines was prompted by the aspiration of the two
peoples to forge and develop friendly ties between the two
countries, a DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The setting-up of the ambassadorial level ties on the principle
of mutual respect for sovereignty, equality and reciprocity, has
created favorable conditions and circumstances not only for
developing bilateral relations but making positive joint efforts
for peace, prosperity, reconciliation and cooperation in the Asia-
Pacific region, the spokesman told the Korean Central News Agency.
</P>
<P>
It is the invariable stand of the DPRK government to establish
and upgrade friendly and cooperative relations with all the
countries that respect the sovereignty of the DPRK and are
friendly toward it, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK formally established diplomatic relations with the
Philippines by signing a joint communique on July 12 in Manila,
capital of the Philippines, after it opened ties with Italy and
Australia in last January and May respectively.

<HEADLINE> EU's Evaluation of Turkey's Reforms Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Guenter Verheugen, the European
Union (EU) commissioner for Enlargement Affairs, gave mixed
evaluation about Turkey's reforms for EU membership since it was
granted candidacy last December.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner paid a visit to Ankara this week. At a press
conference on Thursday, he expressed satisfaction with the pace of
harmonization reforms in Turkey to join the European club.
</P>
<P>
But later during his meetings with representatives of human
rights organizations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
concerned with democratization, Verheugen criticized Ankara for
lack of improvements on human rights.
</P>
<P>
It has been learned that Verheugen told NGO representatives that
no substantial progress on reforms regarding human rights had been
achieved in Turkey since last December's Helsinki Summit decided to
open the rich-nation club to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Verheugen reportedly stressed that the lack of improvements has
created uneasiness within the EU, adding that the EU had expected a
rapid reform program from Ankara in the wake of the summit.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the EU had not seen a determined political
will on the Turkish side to go ahead with the political reforms
imperative to fulfill the Copenhagen criteria for EU membership.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner warned that if Turkey does not speed up its
efforts, the approval of the accession partnership that is expected
to be carried out at the beginning of November could be in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that Verheugen carefully took notes during his
meetings with NGO representatives, which lasted for nearly one and
a half hour.
</P>
<P>
He told Turkish officials in charge of EU affairs that the EU
expects Turkey's structural reforms to be achieved very soon.
</P>
<P>
Verheugen's remarks during his meetings with the NGOs were in
contrast with his statement at Thursday's press conference where he
said that Turkey was on the right track in its efforts towards EU
membership.
</P>
<P>
He only vaguely touched on the issue of Kurdish-populated
southeast, adding that the EU was against capital punishment and
was working to abolish it worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The EU has been urging Turkey to abolish the death penalty in
its laws and respect rights of ethnic Kurds in culture and other
fields.
</P>
<P>
Verheugen had an intensive agenda in Ankara on Friday as he met
almost all the high-level Turkish authorities, including President
Ahmet Necdet Sezer, Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit and Mesut Yilmaz,
the newly appointed deputy prime minister and state minister
responsible for EU affairs.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Yilmaz, Verheugen said the main topic was
human rights. After he was briefed on human rights reforms in
Turkey, he told Yilmaz that "political will" is very important in
pursuing such reforms.
</P>
<P>
Verheugen will submit a report on Turkey to the EU Commission by
October. The report will be based on to create an accession
partnership for the country.
</P>
<P>
The accession partnership, which means a step forward in
Turkey's process to membership, is expected to be approved in
November by the EU Council of General Affairs.

<HEADLINE> 20 MILF Members Offered Safe Conduct Passes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government announced
Saturday that it has granted safe conduct passes to 20 members of
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) as part of its efforts to
facilitate the resumption of formal peace talks with the group.
</P>
<P>
Those granted safe conduct passes include members of the MILF
peace negotiation team, their consultants and advisers and
technical working staff, government peace panel chairman Edgaro
Batenga said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The passes will take effect on July 20 and last "for the
duration of the peace talks," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This signals the government's commitment to pursue a lasting
peace and ensure the attainment of the full potentials of
development in Mindanao," said Batenga.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada has earlier ordered to issue safety
and security guarantees to MILF members involved in peace
negotiations with the government.
</P>
<P>
Those MILF members "shall not be restrained, searched, seized
and harassed on their persons or property in connection with their
participation or involvement in the peace process, except in cases
of commission of common crimes, such as crimes against persons,
chastity, property and other similar offenses," according to the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The government said it remains hopeful that the stalled peace
talks between the government and the MILF can be resumed on July
29 to discuss an autonomy proposal it offered to the rebel group,
which has been fighting for an independent Islamic state in the
southern island of Mindanao for two decades.
</P>
<P>
In late June the government agreed to extend for 29 days the
June 30 deadline set by President Estrada for the MILF to sign a
peace deal with the government, but on conditions that the MILF
abandon its bid for independence and stop terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
After the MILF rejected the government demands and failed to
meet the deadline, the military began launching attacks on Camp
Abubakar, the rebel group's headquarters in Matanog in the
province of Maguindanao, Mindanao, and captured the rebel
stronghold last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
MILF chairman Hashim Salamat called on fellow Muslims to wage a
jihad or holy war across the country after the fall of Camp
Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
The government said Friday that it may "seriously consider"
granting Salamat a safe conduct pass should he decide to
participate in the peace negotiations and withdraw his call for a
jihad.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Egyptian Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading Egyptian newspapers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Al Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Minister of Culture Farouq Hosni will reopen 12
rocky temples in Aswan in Upper Egypt to tourists when an underway
overhauling project concludes by the end of this year. The project
is the largest to rescue the temples from the sands of oblivion
after they were rescued from sinking under Nasser Lake water in the
wake of the construction of the High Dam.
</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- The Egyptian ministries of tourism, supply and internal
trade, finance, economy and foreign trade have finished their
preparations for the shopping and tourism festival this year, due
to start July 20. Thousands of stores will participate in this
year's festival. They will provide goods at a discount ranging
between 10-70 percent.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- The Egyptian Taxation Department collected 23 billion
Egyptian pounds (6.6 billion U.S. dollars) in the the fiscal year
1999/2000, an increase of 4 billion pounds (1.15 billion dollars)
from that of the previous year, said Department Chairman Talaat
Hamad. It is a big leap although the market suffered from recession
and shortage of liquidity, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Mail:
</P>
<P>
-- Weather experts expect that Egypt's longest heat wave this
summer will end Saturday. For 12 days, soaring temperatures and
high humidity ganged up against people who gasped for a breath of
fresh air but to no avail. At pains to avoid long exposure to the
sun, people, particularly women, unfurled their umbrellas out on
the streets. Others improvised protection from the blazing sun by
covering their heads with whatever close at hand - a newspaper or a
piece of cardboard.

WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinians accused Friday
the U.S. hosts of attempting to isolate Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and his delegation in talks with Israel in a bid to
pressure them into concessions.
</P>
<P>
"This is not the best form of negotiation, to isolate President
Arafat from the (Palestinian Liberation Organization or PLO)
executive committee and his constituency," Palestinian spokeswoman
Hanan Ashrawi said, referring to U.S. refusal of some Palestinian
leaders' demand to see Arafat at Camp David, Maryland.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has invited a dozen senior Palestinian leaders,
including ministers, PLO executive committee members and
opposition leaders, to the heavily guarded U.S. presidential
retreat to consult on the peace negotiations with Israel. (US-

WARSAW -- A Polish MiG-21 fighter jet crashed Friday during a
routine sortie near Pila, Poznan Province, western Poland, killing
its pilot, Warsaw TV reported.
</P>
<P>
The pilot did not report what was wrong with the fighter before
the crash, the third involving Polish MiG-21s since 1999, the
television station said. The report did not give the cause of the
accident, but said such MiG-21 jets in Poland are obsolete. Last
May, a Polish MiG-21 fighter crashed in northern Poland and its
pilot survived. Five months later, another Polish MiG-21 jet
crashed on the Baltic Coast shortly after its pilot ejected. (

<HEADLINE> Governor Election Won't Affect Bangkok's Bid: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The change of Bangkok's governor
will not affect the capital's bid for the 2008 Olympics, an
official of the Bangkok Olympic Bid Organizing Committee (BOBOC)
said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The bid campaign will continue, and will be supported by
whoever was elected as governor on July 23, Tirachai Vutithum, who
oversees the advertising campaign and public survey of the BOBOC.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the officials in charge of the bid campaign
will continue to hold office as they had been appointed by the
Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
"Hosting the Olympics will help the country's economy. So
whoever becomes the new governor should support the bid," he
stated.
</P>
<P>
The five finalists for holding the Games will be announced on
August 29. Tirachai said the original plan had been to set up the
company responsible for handling the bidding ahead of that date.
But the BOBOC had now decided to start the process early and
submit its proposal to the Cabinet ahead of the results.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Bangkok's chances of winning the first-round bid,
Tirachai said that the city had a good chance of making it to the
second round.
</P>
<P>
"There are seven International Olympic Committee (IOC) members
who have the right to vote and one of them is a German, who I am
certain will vote for Bangkok in return of our vote which help
Germany clinch the 2006 soccer World Cup bid, " he added.
</P>
<P>
"Besides, none of the bidding cities have hosted the Olympics,
which gives each one of them an equal chance."
</P>
<P>
He believed that if Bangkok was chosen to be one of the five
finalists, private companies will come forward with their support.
General Chetta Thanajaro, chairman of the country's Olympic
Committee,had offered to help in this regard.
</P>
<P>
"The budget for the second-round bid is estimated at around 500
million baht (12.5 million US dollars), but we might not be able
to generate such a huge sum without good support from the private
sector," Tirachai said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Tourism Authority of Thailand's development
service director, Wansadet Tawornsuk, confirmed that the authority
will start overseas promotion of the bid if Bangkok wins the
second round.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Calls for Politically Correct, Clear-Headed Young, Middle- aged Cadres (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Young and middle-aged cadres who
can withstand severe tests and stay clear-headed in major
struggles and crises should be promoted to leading positions,
Chinese President Jiang Zemin said recently.
</P>
<P>
They should also be able to mobilize and lead the masses to
surmount the difficulties, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also general secretary of the CPC Central
Committee, made the call on June 9 in an address at the national
conference of Party schools, which is to be published in the
leading Chinese magazine Seeking Truth on July 16.
</P>
<P>
In the building of the Party, priority should be given to
improving the ideological and political quality of leading Party
officials, especially the young and middle-aged ones, so that they
will become a new generation of politicians who are loyal to
Marxism, adhere to the socialist road with China's characteristics,
and are capable of running the Party and the State, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"The young and middle-aged officials are the hope of the Party
and the nation," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He strengthened education on the nature of the Party for the
young and middle-aged cadres so as to help them adhere to the
fundamental principle of devoting themselves to the people.

They should be open-minded so as to be good at judging the
general trends of the world's development and correctly assess the
demands of the time, he said.
</P>
<P>
They should be trained to think strategically so that they can
resolve major problems in reform, development and stability in a
realistic way, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
In general, their understanding of Marxism should be largely
improved to help them master Marxist positions, viewpoints and
approaches, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The top Party leader stressed that three points should be
considered during the selection of leading officials:
</P>
<P>

<P>
-- People with fine quality and development potential should be
timely selected and carefully fostered by giving them proper
leading positions;

<HEADLINE> 2 Shot Dead at Mass Wedding in Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 15 (Xinhua) -- A gunman of a Palestinian tribe broke
into a mass wedding here Friday evening, shot dead a member of a
rival tribe before he was killed by police guarding the gathering,
police sources said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The gunman, identified as Khalid Ghizawi, was believed to be
revenging Saeed Harazeen, a guest at the mass wedding of some 70
Muslim couples on the campus of the Al-Itihad high school in the
north-western Sport City area of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Harazeen, then chatting with friends at the party, died after he
was shot five times into the chest before policemen on duty
returned fire and killed the attacker, causing panic among a crowd
of some 5,000 people at the campus party.
</P>
<P>
The party was cancelled and none of the brides and bridegrooms
sustained injuries.
</P>
<P>
Ghizawi killed Harazeen in retaliation for the recent killing of
a relative by Harazeen's tribe and he bore no intention to sabotage
the mass wedding, according to preliminary police investigations.
</P>
<P>
The two, from Palestinian families of the Gaza Strip in the West
Bank, had lived in Jordan's Gaza refugee camp for Palestinians
before the shooting incident on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Study: Sons Of Alcoholic Men Have Lower IQ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The sons of alcoholic fathers,
especially fathers who also have antisocial personality disorder,
are at greater risk for intellectual and academic deficits than
other boys are, according to a study released Friday.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by researchers at Michigan State
University and published in the July issue of Alcoholism: Clinical
and Experimental Research, analyzed 198 elementary school-age boys.
</P>
<P>
Two thirds of the boys came from families with alcoholic
fathers. The children were grouped according to whether they had
alcoholic fathers with antisocial personalities (AAL), alcoholic
fathers without such tendencies (NAAL), or fathers without alcohol
problems.
</P>
<P>
Edwin Poon, author of the study, said he and his colleagues
found that, in virtually every measure of intellectual and
academic function, AAL boys scored significantly lower than boys
without alcoholic parents. Their IQs, while clearly within the
normal range, were lower, and these boys were more distractible,
had more difficulty with mazes, and did not perform as well on
spelling and arithmetic tests.
</P>
<P>
NAAL boys had somewhat lower overall IQ scores and performed
less well than boys from nonalcoholic families in arithmetic,
according to the investigators.
</P>
<P>
"We've continued to follow these kids, and many of them are
about to enter adolescence," Poon said. "We should have more to
report in the next year or two regarding whether our predictions
for these children of alcoholics hold up."

<HEADLINE> International Sand Sculpture Festival in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHOUSHAN, (ZHEJIANG) July 15 (Xinhua) -- An international sand
sculpture festival kicked off today at the Golden Beach of
Zhujiajian, an islet east off Zhoushan Island, east China's
Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
A total of 23 sand sculptures, which were created by Chinese
and overseas masters in the past eight days, are shown at the
festival, the second of its kind and featuring the theme of "
miracles of the century".
</P>
<P>
Pavel Zadaniouk from Russia won the first prize for his work
among the international competitors' group, while Zhao Baokang
from east China's Shanghai was also given a top prize in the
domestic competitors' group.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the competitions, the festival will include
other activities such as exhibitions of the sand and ice
sculptures, tours to the state ecological park at Zhujiajian and
pilgrimages to Mount Putuo, one of China's four famous Buddhist
shrines, and a photographic contest on sand sculpture.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the first Zhoushan international
sand sculpture festival, which was held last October, brought
about 100 million yuan in total income to Zhoushan.

<HEADLINE> Instruction on Party Building Comes After Lengthy Deliberation: Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin, general secretary of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, says he put
a lot of thought into the well-known instruction on Party building.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Jiang in a June 9 speech at the national
conference of Party schools. "I put forward the remark after a
long time of thinking," said Jiang in the 10,000-character speech
to be published by Seeking Truth magazine on July 16.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, Jiang said that the CPC represents the
development requirements of China's advanced social productive
forces, the progressive course of China's advanced culture, and
the fundamental interests of the majority of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
In the process of carrying out the reform and opening up policy
and developing the socialist market economy, the questions of what
a Party should be and how it should be built are important and are
directly related to the future of the Party and the country, Jiang
said in the June 9 address.
</P>
<P>
"We have achieved some new experience in strengthening and
improving the Party building," he said, emphasizing that the Party
must adhere to the "three representatives" if it wants to abide by
the theories on Party building set forth by Mao Zedong and Deng
Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
The "three representatives" is the aim for establishing the
Party, the foundation for governing the country, and the source of
power, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He urged all Party members, especially senior cadres, to
consider the "three representatives" as they ponder the positive
and negative experiences of the Party in its history, and also how
the Party will withstand internal and external risks of various
kinds in the future.

<HEADLINE> Tourist Arrivals Decline in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A total of 186,580 foreign tourists arrived in Sri Lanka in the
first five months of this year, a decrease of 1.5 percent from the
same period of last year, according to the Board.
</P>
<P>
During the month of May, a total of 23,404 tourists arrived as
against 25,212 in the same period in 1999, recording a decrease of
7.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
To increase tourist arrivals, the government is launching a 10
million U.S. dollar tourism campaign to sell and promote the
country's varied attractions in the world tourism market, tourist
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The government approved five million U.S. dollars for the
campaign in March this year. The balance is to be contributed by
the tourist board.
</P>
<P>
The government has appointed a special Marketing Advisory
Committee to draw up an extensive marketing strategy to boost the
national image and market Sri Lanka as an attractive tourist
destination, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka recorded 436,440 tourist arrivals last year, an
increase of 14.5 percent over the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Enterprise Resource Management Application Market Expected to Expand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide sales of enterprise
resource management applications are expected to grow from 14.5
billion U.S. dollars last year to 24.8 billion dollars in 2004,
according to a report released Friday.
</P>
<P>
This market will be fueled by organizations, especially midsize
companies, that want to reduce the task of integrating, operating
and maintaining multiple standalone applications, said the report
from U.S. market research firm International Data Corporation (IDC)
.
</P>
<P>
The rapid creation of smaller companies, driven by the internet
economy, the IDC said, will continue to drive growth of the market,
which includes accounting, human resource management and payroll,
and materials management applications. Accounting is and will
remain the largest segment, and materials management applications
will be the fastest-growing market, the IDC added.
</P>
<P>
"The Internet and e-commerce will be the growth engine for the
materials management software market for a number of years to come,
" said the report. "The multitude of new Internet companies
involved in business-to-business and business-to-consumer sales
has heated up demand for sophisticated new order fulfillment
software."
</P>
<P>
According to the IDC, North America will account for more than
half of the worldwide enterprise resource management application
market's revenues throughout the forecast. But the Middle East and
Eastern Europe will be the fastest-growing regions of the world.

<HEADLINE> San Francisco Approves Medical Use Of Marijuana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 14 (Xinhua) -- A district attorney announced
Friday that local sick people with 25 dollars and a doctor's note
can get an official city ID card entitling them to use marijuana.
</P>
<P>
"This represents another stone in the foundation we're building
to make people recognize that cannabis is a legitimate medicinal
agent," said District Attorney Terence Hallinan.
</P>
<P>
The program shields card-holders caught with the drug from
local prosecution -- though marijuana possession remains illegal
under federal law.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, a doctor must sign a form agreeing to
monitor the patient's medical condition. The cards are good for up
to two years, and minors can get them too with approval from a
parent or guardian. The program doesn't address how card-holders
will obtain the drug. It merely shields them from prosecution --
and then only local prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Californians voted to legalize marijuana for medical use in
1996, but the ballot measure they approved has been entangled in
legal disputes ever since.
</P>
<P>
In addition to California, measures approving the medical use
of marijuana have passed in Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Maine, Nevada,
Oregon and Washington state.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Charles R. Breyer of San Francisco said he
would rule Monday in the complex case, which draws in the wider
conflict between California's medical marijuana initiative and
federal drug regulations.
</P>
<P>
Former state Attorney General Dan Lungren opposed any attempt
to carry out the 1996 ballot measure and shut down most of the
state's informal marijuana distribution clubs.
</P>
<P>
But since Bill Lockyer took over as attorney general last year,
the state's position has shifted toward support for the creation
of a statewide marijuana ID program.
</P>
<P>
Police officials have described the program as an efficient way
to distinguish medical users from recreational ones.
</P>
<P>
"This is a wonderful civics lesson that could only occur in a
place like San Francisco," said Police Department Assistant Chief
Prentice Sanders. "We find that this is an orderly way to carry
out the law and the will of the people."

<HEADLINE> Fostering of Young, Middle-aged Leading Cadres a Strategy of Communist Party: Jiang (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Constant fostering of young and
middle-aged leading cadres has always been a strategic task for
the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee,
made the remark June 9 in an address at the national conference of
Party schools, which is to be published by a leading Chinese
magazine Seeking Truth on July 16.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Jiang urged that people recognize the importance
of fostering a large group of young and middle-aged leading Party
cadres who can handle the demands of the new century.
</P>
<P>
Jiang attacked the hegemony and power politics now evident in
the world, saying there's a long way to go before a multi-
polarized world can be achieved, as the United States has been
extraordinarily powerful in economic, science and technology, and
military fields.
</P>
<P>
He described the ongoing economic globalization as an "
objective process with dual nature."
</P>
<P>
The status of developing countries may be further weakened if
no correct countermeasures are taken when the developed western
countries are attempting to take the lead in the economic
globalization, according to Jiang, who is also Chinese president
and chairman of the Central Military Commission.

<P>
Jiang went on to point out that Chinese people should firmly
seize the opportunity to accelerate the country's development and
resolutely safeguard the country's interest and security.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the socialist modernization drive in China is to
enter into a new stage, Jiang said, stressing that China's general
goal is to basically realize socialist modernization and the great
reinvigoration of the Chinese nation by the mid-21st century.
</P>
<P>
The CPC is in a crucial period of transition between the elder
and younger generations of cadres, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Without a large number of leading officials who have both
ability and political integrity, it will be impossible for the
Party to rule the big country with a population of 1.26 billion
and to lead the people of different ethnic groups in pushing
forward the arduous modernization drive under complicated internal
and external circumstances, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The current and future competition in the world is,
fundamentally speaking, focused on the competition for talented
professionals, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Both history and current circumstances show that the success of
a nation and a political party largely relies on whether or not it
can foster outstanding and talented leaders, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
China's socialist cause will be consolidated and developed and
China will always stand invincible in the acute international
competition in the future so long as the CPC can constantly foster
a large number of highly qualified and talented leading officials,
he said.

<HEADLINE> More Pregnant Women Infected with HIV in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Thailand witnesses a rise in the
HIV infection among pregnant women in recent two to three years,
not long after it won applause for the epidemic prevention from
the United Nations, the Bangkok Post reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The latest report of the Public Health Ministry's epidemiology
division showed that 1.76 percent of pregnant women were infected
with HIV last year against 1.53 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
While the overall picture showed the HIV rate among pregnant
women to be 1.76 percent, the rate was 5.91 percent in the North,
2.02 percent in the Central region, 1.92 percent in the South and
1.25 percent in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
The rate among Thai pregnant women peaked at 2.29 percent in
1995, then gradually declined to 1.81 percent in 1996 and 1.68
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The report coincided with United Nation's Children's Fund's (
UNICEF) Progress of Nations 2000 report released recently.
</P>
<P>
Gamini Abeysekera, the UNICEF representative in Thailand, said
the report stressed the need to mobilize all sectors of society.
Adolescents constituted the most vulnerable age group due to
ignorance of the need for safe sex, he said.
</P>
<P>
Thai Public Health Minister Korn Dabbaransi said efforts were
under way to reduce vertical HIV-positive transmission from women
to their newborn.
</P>
<P>
By making anti-retroviral drugs available to HIV-positive
pregnant women, Korn said, HIV infection among infants had been
reduced from 25 percent in recent years to 7.5 percent today.

<HEADLINE> Strong Quake Rocks Japan's Niijima Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- A powerful earthquake measuring 6.2
on the Richter scale jolted Niijima Island and nearby islands
south of Tokyo on Saturday morning, injuring two people and
causing landslides, the Meteorological Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The two people suffered minor injuries in the quake, which
occurred at 10.30 a.m. (0130 GMT), the agency said, adding that
several landslides were observed on the islands, and 700
households suffered power cuts.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government set up a task force at the prime
minister's official residence at 11 a.m. (0200 GMT) to cope with
the quake and monitor the situation in affected areas.
</P>
<P>
The quake was also felt in various parts of eastern and central
Japan including Tokyo, Yokohama, Chiba and Nagano prefectures.
</P>
<P>
The epicenter of the tremor was estimated at 10 kilometers
under the sea near Niijima and Kozushima, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Landslides on Niijima covered part of a road and destroyed at
least one home, the Kyodo news agency quoted local officials as
saying.
</P>
<P>
About 200 residents were seeking refuge in Niijima's Wakago
medical center after the quake, Kyodo quoted local police as
saying.
</P>
<P>
On Japan's largest main island of Honshu, train service on the
Tokaido Shinkansen Line was suspended between Mishima and Shizuoka
stations following the quake, but resumed 10 minutes later, the
news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The strong quake occurred shortly after Mt. Oyama, the 813-
meter volcano at the center of Miyakejima Island, erupted again.
</P>
<P>
The Meteorological Agency said the eruption took place at 6.37
a.m. (2137 GMT Friday) on the island, which lies some 180
kilometers south of Tokyo. The volcano erupted on July 8 and 14.

for its admission as a Southern Common Market (Mercosur) full
member.

WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- World 100-meter record holder
Maurice Greene clocked 9.93 seconds at the U.S. Olympic trials in
Sacramento on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Greene's time was the second-fastest of the season, in his
qualifying race. After the race he promptly laid down a challenge
to 200-meter world record holder Michael Johnson, whom he will
meet over that distance in the trials next week.
</P>
<P>
"He thinks he's unbeatable, but you know who won the last race
we ran," said Greene, who defeated Johnson in the 1998 Prefontaine
Classic to even their record at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
While Greene still has semifinals and a final in the 100 meters
Saturday, he made it clear whom he really wanted to beat.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Payatas dumpsite death toll rises to 148 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 15, (Xinhua) -- The death toll in a trash dumpsite
landslide in Metro Manila has risen to 148 as rescuers recovered
the body of a teenage boy at the site early Saturday morning,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The number of people missing can not be determined yet after
Monday's massive landslide at the Payatas garbage dumpsite in
Quezon City, said the National Disaster Coordinating Council.
</P>
<P>
According to a local TV report, more than 180 people might
still be buried in the heap of rubbish after the avalanche, which
was set off by heavy rains from recent typhoons.
</P>
<P>
The council said rescuers have found 59 survivors so far and
496 families or 2,280 persons have been evacuated to safe places.
Sixty people were injured in the tragedy, it added.
</P>
<P>
Health Secretary Alberto Romualdez on Friday warned scavengers
who refused to leave Payatas to get out of the dumpsite or face
the danger of inhaling toxic fumes being emitted by the huge pile
of garbage and other hazardous materials.
</P>
<P>
There were reportedly 50,000 people residing in Payatas. The
open dumpsite was scheduled to be closed in 1999, but the closure
was held back for lack of an alternative disposal site for Quezon
City 's more than 700 tons of daily garbage.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Accuse U.S. of Isolating Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinians accused Friday
the U.S. hosts of attempting to isolate Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and his delegation in talks with Israel in a bid to
pressure them into concessions.
</P>
<P>
"This is not the best form of negotiation, to isolate President
Arafat from the (Palestinian Liberation Organization or PLO)
executive committee and his constituency," Palestinian spokeswoman
Hanan Ashrawi said, referring to U.S. refusal of some Palestinian
leaders' demand to see Arafat at Camp David, Maryland.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has invited a dozen senior Palestinian leaders,
including ministers, PLO executive committee members and
opposition leaders, to the heavily guarded U.S. presidential
retreat to consult on the peace negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
To pacify the Palestinians' discontent, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright on Friday went to the town of Emmitsburg, 12
kilometers north of Camp David, to meet with six Palestinian
leaders who had flown in to consult with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
But Albright gave no commitment that they would be allowed into
Camp David.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Minister of Parliamentary Affairs Nabil Amr, who
refused to meet Albright, said: "We are here to meet with
President Arafat, not Madeleine Albright."
</P>
<P>
"This is an interference in Palestinian internal affairs and we
perceive it as an attempt to isolate the negotiators and force
concessions on the Palestinian side," Amr said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a code of secrecy agreed by all delegations at
Camp David, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said that "Given
the spirit of the ground rules we put down, we indicated that we
prefer that the meeting (with Arafat) not happen up at Camp David.
"
</P>
<P>
He explained that Washington did not want to disturb the "
positive atmosphere" at the presidential retreat.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. hosts did allow Dan Meridor, former Israeli
finance minister and now a member of parliament, to enter Camp
David and join the Israeli delegation two days after the summit
began.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton opened the summit with Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Tuesday at David Camp, hoping that his mediation could help solve
the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians and
reach a final status agreement between the two sides.

<HEADLINE> State Cuts Number of Staff By Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- About 2.5 million public servants,
about half of those hired by local governments throughout China,
have been laid off during the ongoing government restructuring, "
China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was the latest update on the effort to streamline
government into a highly efficient force of expert civil servants.
The reform was first completed by the end of 1998 at State-level
agencies.
</P>
<P>
Song Defu, minister of personnel, confirmed the number of the
laid-off government employees at a seminar yesterday on public
administration reform in Asia, attended by some 50 scholars and
practitioners from 12 Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Central and local government staff once totaled 5.5 million,
said Wang Feng, director-general of the State Commission Office
for Public Service Structure and Establishment, in his report.
</P>
<P>
During the central government level reform, the number of
employees was cut by half from 32,000 to 16,000, including nearly
40 ministers and over 550 bureau directors.
</P>
<P>
In the future, local governments at provincial, city and county
levels will follow suit, reducing their staff by about 50 percent,
according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
Experts said overstaffing has caused low efficiency and
additional financial burdens. The economic globalization has
prompted Asian countries to speed up the reform of public
administration, they said.
</P>
<P>
By exchanging reform experiences with other Asian countries,
Song said he hopes "China can also share the achievements of
reform with them."
</P>
<P>
"It is of vital importance for China to push forward and ensure
a sustainable development of economy through intensifying the
reform of administration and building a capable government with
high efficiency," Song said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military Told to Punish Troops Involved in Riot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Defense Minister Juwono
Sudarsono has asked the Military (TNI) to punish troops involved
in the riot in Maluku and North Maluku provinces.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that elements outside Maluku wanted the riots
in Maluku to continue.
</P>
<P>
"The truth is, the people of Ambon (capital of Maluku) and
Maluku, whether Muslims or Christians, are exhausted after
brawling for almost two years. Every time efforts are made to find
a peaceful solution, there is always a disturbance from a third
party from outside Maluku," Sudarsono was quoted by the Indonesian
Observer Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Military and the House of Representatives (DPR) Friday held
an evaluation meeting here to discuss the latest development in
Maluku and North Maluku.
</P>
<P>
Sudarsono said the evaluation meeting agreed to repatriate
those who were not supposed to be there, and who were apparently
involved in the riot.
</P>
<P>
The meeting agreed that the state of civil emergency in the two
provinces should remain intact and ruled out the possibility of
imposing martial law to stop the continuing clashes there.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also resulted in an agreement to intensify gun
sweeps, forcing Laskar Jihad (Jihad Force) Muslim volunteers to
quit the islands.
</P>
<P>
Sudarsono said he has asked TNI Chief Admiral Widodo A.S. and
Army Chief General Tyasno Sudarto to evaluate the involvement of
Army troops in the communal riots in Maluku and North Maluku.
</P>
<P>
"Neutral" security personnel would be sent to Maluku to replace
the personnel who had taken sides with the warring groups, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The government would rely on the Navy to apprehend Laskar Jihad
members and remove them from the provinces on the grounds that
they had ignited fresh clashes there.
</P>
<P>
"The dispatch of Laskar Jihad and any other forces has reached
almost 10,000 people in the last three months and they have become
the main reason for the ongoing ground conflict," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sporadic clashes have continued despite the state of emergency
imposed last month in the Maluku and North Maluku provinces, where
18-month fighting between Muslims and Christians has claimed more
than 3,000 lives.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Minister: No Need for OPEC Emergency Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia said there is no need to
hold an immediate emergency meeting of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to raise crude oil production.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia's opinion is that an emergency meeting is not
necessary," the Jakarta Post daily Saturday quoted Minister of
Mines and Energy Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister was commenting on a Thursday night meeting with
OPEC Secretary-General Rilwanu Lukman, who asked him about
Indonesia's position over Saudi Arabia's proposal to hold an
extraordinary meeting on July 18.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil prices have continued to soar, despite OPEC's
decision in June to hike production by 700,000 barrels per day (
bpd).
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the trend, Bambang said on Friday that Indonesia
would refer to the response mechanism that OPEC had agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
He said that under the response mechanism, OPEC would raise its
output by another 500,000 bpd only if oil prices remained over 28
U.S. dollars per barrel for 20 consecutive market days.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia suggests that we wait for the 20 market days to pass
and afterward OPEC will take action," he said.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has said it would unilaterally hike output by 500,
000 bpd if prices did not come down.
</P>
<P>
OPEC members were seeking agreement on Friday for Saudi Arabia'
s proposal on the extraordinary meeting, but some OPEC members
were against the meeting. Indonesia is the only OPEC member in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indonesian state oil and gas company Pertamina said
that Indonesia was having difficulties in raising output by 37,000
bpd to meet its present quota of some 1.317 million bpd.

<HEADLINE> THAI-SIA to Raise Airfares on Bangkok-Singapore Route </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Thai Airways International Plc. (
THAI), the national carrier, and Singapore Airlines (SIA), are
planning to jointly increase airfares on the Bangkok-Singapore
route, the Thai News Agency (TNA) said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
THAI director for Thailand Aran Apichart was quoted as saying
that THAI and SIA were discussing the new rates, as the two
national carriers had realized that they should not compete
against each other, but cooperate, because they had held a
combined market share of 70 percent on the route.
</P>
<P>
The two airlines were also discussing a shuttle flight service
with increased frequency, which will further help increase their
market share on the route, he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
THAI and SIA together operate 12 flights a day on the Bangkok-
Singapore route; while other airlines, including Cathay Pacific,
Swissair, and SAS, offer a daily flight on the route, but charge
considerably less fares.
</P>
<P>
THAI is also negotiating with Cathay Pacific on the similar
form of cooperation on the Bangkok-Hong Kong route, the Thai
official said.

JAKARTA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Joint Investigating Team
tasked to investigate the attack against the headquarters of the
Indonesian Democratic party (PDI) on July 27, 1996, has affirmed
the involvement of the military in the bloody incident.
</P>
<P>
The involvement of the military was based on information given

WARSAW, July 14 (Xinhua) -- A Polish MiG-21 fighter jet crashed
Friday during a routine sortie near Pila, Poznan Province, western
Poland, killing its pilot, Warsaw TV reported.
</P>
<P>
The pilot did not report what was wrong with the fighter before
the crash, the third involving Polish MiG-21s since 1999, the
television station said. The report did not give the cause of the
accident, but said such MiG-21 jets in Poland are obsolete.
</P>
<P>
Last May, a Polish MiG-21 fighter crashed in northern Poland
and its pilot survived. Five months later, another Polish MiG-21
jet crashed on the Baltic Coast shortly after its pilot ejected.
</P>
<P>
The country is looking to decommission more than 200 old-
fashioned MiG-21s as part of its drive to upgrade its defense
forces to meet standards required by NATO, which it joined last
year.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Peter Wessels of the
Netherlands recovered a five month illness absence to outlast
fourth-seeded Jonas Bjorkman to reach the semifinals of the Hall
of Fame Tennis Championships in Newport of Rhode Island on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wessels took the game in 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 and will face will face
seventh-seeded Australian Wayne Arthurs, who trounced Mardy Fish,
6-3, 6-2, in Saturday's semifinals.
</P>
<P>
Off the circuit from December until May with an undetermined
illness he described as "over-tiredness," the slender 6-4 Wessels
authored the upset with a solid serve-and volley game and some
highly consistent returns.
</P>
<P>
Wessels took a 6-3 lead in the first set tiebreaker, then
yielded the next two points.
</P>
<P>
Finally, with Bjorkman serving, Wessels ripped a passing shot
down the line to take the set.
</P>
<P>
Bjorkman, who went into the quarterfinals as the highest
remaining seed, felt he lost confidence in his return game.
</P>
<P>
Arthurs fired 16 aces in his runaway over Fish, an 18-year-old
Floridian who turned pro a year ago and was playing in his first
career quarterfinal. As might be expected, he had troubles
returning.
</P>
<P>
Fish had raised some eyebrows here Thursday by putting out top-
seeded defending champion Chris Woodruff.
</P>
<P>
In the other semifinal bracket, which was determined Thursday,
fifth-seeded Jason Stoltenberg of Australia will oppose unseeded
Jens Knippschild of Germany.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin's Instruction on Party Building to Guide Cultural Work: Li Lanqing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The remark on Party building made
by Chinese President Jiang Zemin early this year should serve to
guide the country's cultural work, Vice-Premier Li Lanqing has
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's instruction embodies the goals of the CPC, the essence
of socialism as well as the overall development demands of
politics, economy and culture in the course of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics, Li said this in a speech carried in
the latest issue of China's leading ideological magazine Seeking
Truth.
</P>
<P>
During his February tour of the southern province of Guangdong,
Jiang said that the key to running China well lies in the Chinese
Communist Party (CPC), in its ideology, style of work,
organization, discipline, capabilities and leadership.
</P>
<P>
The CPC will remain successful and enjoy the heartfelt support
of the people of China so long as the party always earnestly
represents the development requirements of China's advanced social
productive forces, the progressive course of China's advanced
culture, and the fundamental interests of the Chinese people,
noted Jiang, the top leader of the CPC.
</P>
<P>
For the country's cultural circles, it is imperative to fully
grasp the idea that the CPC always advocates the progressive
course of China's advanced culture, the vice-premier said in the
magazine article.
</P>
<P>
China's cultural circles should follow Jiang's instruction and
make their utmost contributions to the promotion of socialist
culture and to the overall economic and social progress, the vice-
premier stressed.

<HEADLINE> Mortar Blasts Hit Northern Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Several mortar shells exploded
Saturday night in northern Tehran, causing damage to some
residential units, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The shells hit a residential area at 2135 hours local time (1705
GMT) close to the state Mint House near the crossroad of Shahid
Hemat highway and Niavaran highway, eyewitnesses were quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Parts of the headquarters of the Iranian elite Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps are located several kilometers north of
the explosion area.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear so far whether the explosions caused any
casualties and no one has claimed responsibility for the mortar
attack.
</P>
<P>
Iran's main opposition group Mujahedeen Khalq Organization (MKO)
has launched several mortar attacks on government and military
targets in the Iranian capital of Tehran during the past six
months.
</P>
<P>
The MKO, a major political and military group which had fought
against the Iranian shah regime before the 1979 Islamic revolution,
was outlawed in 1981 and fled into Iraq following sharp differences
with the then Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
Labeled by Iran a "terrorist group," the MKO has launched a
series of cross-border attacks on Iran in recent years, including
assassinating senior Iranian officials. In retaliation, Iranian
armed forces also launched several air raids on the MKO bases in
Iraq.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Trapped Troops in S. Leone Rescued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 15 (Xinhua) --The 220 U.N. peacekeepers and 11
observers surrounded by Sierra Leone rebels since early May have
been rescued and airlifted to the country's capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from Freetown on Saturday said that the
heavily armed peacekeepers participating in the rescuing operation
met no resistance from the rebels.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. peacekeeping team entered (the eastern town of)
Kailahun at the position where the observers were encircled and
walked them out," a U.N. spokeswoman was quoted as saying in
Freetown on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 11 international military observers were then taken to
Freetown by helicopters, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said that the 220 Indian troops were also liberated and
were now making their way by road to the areas controlled by the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The troops had been detained in Kailahun since May after the
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) broke a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
In the past two weeks, the rebels refused to allow the U.N.
force in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) to send food to the surrounded
troops. Heavy rains had also limited the detained troops' ability
to move.
</P>
<P>
"With a distress signal received from Kailahun, regarding the
dwindling food and medical stocks, there was no alternative to a
military action," according to a U.N. statement published on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The RUF's illegal actions, which have been universally
condemned and for which appeals had been made by UNAMSIL to the
RUF for quick resolution, yielded no results," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Urges U.S. to Help Solve S. Leone Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
has called for urgent action by the United States, and the
international community in general to prevent the situation in
Sierra Leone from deteriorating any further.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting Saturday in the country's capital Abuja
with a delegation of the U. S. government led by Under Secretary
of State Thomas Pickering, Obasanjo said his government is very
concerned about the recent resurgence of crisis in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Having already committed a lot of its human and material
resources to the cause of peace in Sierra Leone, Nigeria would
welcome greater support from the United States and the
international community to ensure lasting peace is achieved in
that country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Other issues, including U.S. President Bill Clinton's
forthcoming state visit to Nigeria, were also discussed at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Pickering told Obasanjo that Clinton is looking forward to the
visit with great expectation as he wishes to make the
consolidation of bilateral relations with the largest black nation
on earth one of the final foreign policy accomplishments of his
administration.

<HEADLINE> S. African Ruling Party Urged Not to Lose Contact With Masses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
President Nelson Mandela Saturday urged his successor Thabo Mbeki
and other African National Congress (ANC) leaders to keep touch
with ordinary South Africans.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary for us to start talking about commitment to
the people. We must actually turn that into practice and go in the
areas that we stay and live. You will be surprised at the response,
" Mandela said at the last day of the ANC's national general
council.
</P>
<P>
The former president also focused on the ANC's call for a new
cadre, one imbued with the spirit of selflessness and voluntarism.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the weaknesses of ANC branches to, among other
things, the selfishness and self-enrichment of members.
</P>
<P>
Members were only interested in what positions they might hold
and not how they could serve the community, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The only way of tempering that is that they must be engaged in
worthy projects," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela repeated his warning of 1997 that the ANC should get
rid of its careerists and opportunists.
</P>
<P>
The ANC's successes had nothing to do with "any particular
individual", but because of the efforts of the party's collective
leadership, he said, warning that individualism and factionalism
has taken root in party ranks.
</P>
<P>
He urged members to be loyal and to respect their leaders,
saying there were those outside the organization, including
opposition parties, who were trying to sow discord in the ANC.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the need for a collective leadership was as
necessary today as during the past.
</P>
<P>
"We need the commitment of leaders at all levels in order to
achieve a better life for all that we promised our people," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to poverty, Mandela said, the ANC should not be
ashamed "in admitting that poverty is still with us."
</P>
<P>
"It is not enough to say that we have inherited it, it is more
important to take steps as a matter of utmost urgency to put an
end to it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela repeated that he had confidence in Mbeki and the ANC
leadership and the good judgment of the vast majority of the ANC's
members and South Africans.
</P>
<P>
"The ANC is on the march. There is no force in the country,
whatsoever, that can stop the ANC," he said.

<HEADLINE> 100,000 Children Treated as Slaves in Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Around 100,000 children aged six to
14 years work in conditions of slavery as domestic servants in
Peru, revealed a report published by the Center of Social Studies
and Publications (CESIP) Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The study, which bares the serious situation of Peruvian
childhood, said that the infants are forced to execute heavy tasks,
for extenuating working hours, without time limit, and are exposed
to many humiliations.
</P>
<P>
The CESIP's Promotion and Defense of the Child and the
Adolescent Program chief, Isaac Ruiz, said that this dramatic
situation must be eradicated because it violates the elemental
rights of the infant.
</P>
<P>
"Children work must not exist, and much less in the home" in
the opinion of international organizations like the United Nations
Fund for Infancy (UNICEF) and the International Labor Organization
(ILO), added Ruiz.
</P>
<P>
Ruiz said that none of the pertaining legal dispositions that
protect the Peruvian minors are abided by in this country.
</P>
<P>
The official said that most of the small domestic servants are
girls who are brought to the capital of the country by the so-
called godfathers or godmothers, who put them to work in
conditions of servitude in the homes of well-to-do families.
</P>
<P>
"The employers promise them study, board and lodging, money,
and good treatment, but finally they get nothing and are exploited,
" said the social researcher.
</P>
<P>
Ruiz said that the working hours of the domestic servants are
round the clock and that they cannot go to school, becoming little
slaves or serfs in the home.
</P>
<P>
"They are exposed to numerous dangers, like sexual abuse,
discrimination, drug addiction, criminality and debasing treatment,
" explained the CESIP official.
</P>
<P>
Ruiz said that there is a trend to avoid to mention the theme
because in 1993, when 435,000 children were detected working in
these conditions, 14.4 percent of them as household servants,
nobody said anything.
</P>
<P>
Today more than 2 million children work in Peru in the worst
material conditions and without the possibility of developing and
growing healthy, said Ruiz.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Starts AIDS Prevention Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Cuba has started a program to tell
young people how to protect themselves from AIDS, as part of the
efforts to reduce the incidence of this disease in the country,
the local press reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The new education project titled "Summer 2000 Campaign" aims at
informing the youths through television and posters about the
several ways to protect themselves from the Acquired Immuno-
Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).
</P>
<P>
The health authorities said that July and August, the vacation
months for Cuban students, are the time when young people take
part in more recreational activities that can lead to unsafe sex
relations.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the new program concurs with the 13th
World Conference on AIDS in Durban, South Africa, at which
scientists and technicians join their efforts to establish a joint
action against the disease caused by the Human Immuno-Defficiency
Virus (HIV).
</P>
<P>
Studies carried out in the island revealed that there are many
young people who think that they cannot be reached by the deadly
disease, and have a very low perception of the risk.
</P>
<P>
Cuban Public Health Minister Carlos Dotres said that 2,762 HIV
positive cases have been detected since 1986, of which 1,036 were
developed into AIDS, and 720 people died.
</P>
<P>
Local estimates for the year 2010 raised the figure of HIV
positive people to 7,500, of whom 60 percent are concentrated in
the capital, and that this is an incentive to continue the fight
against the disease.
</P>
<P>
The first cases of AIDS patients appeared in Cuba in the 1980s,
and since then a campaign has started, first to control, and then
to reduce the incidence of the disease

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sanctions To Damage Peru's Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian exports would lose custom
tariff benefits this year for 80 million dollars if the United
States unilaterally applies trade sanctions to this country,
economic analyst Javier Mujica said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The specialist said that some 80 percent of Peruvian exports to
the U.S. market could be affected by the cancellation of the
tariff privileges.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian exports to the United States amount to more than 700
million dollars a year and basically they are textiles,
handicrafts, minerals and agricultural and livestock commodities.
</P>
<P>
Mujica said that the exclusion from the U.S. Generalized System
of Tariff Preferences (SPG) was already threatened in 1994, when U.
S. labor unions denounced the illegal subsidies of Peruvian
exports as a consequence of Peruvian labor laws of 1992.
</P>
<P>
At that time the government of President Alberto Fujimori
promised the United States to coordinate the labor legislation of
his country with the international standards and in this way he
prevented Peru from being excluded from the SPG
</P>
<P>
Mujica said that the sanctions that restrict trade and
investments are not, for their very nature, among the first
unilateral measures implemented by the U.S. international policies.
</P>
<P>
The analyst added that the United States will implement
unilateral measures when it understands that other nations are not
fully convinced that they must do it.

<HEADLINE> Fidel Castro Meets Elian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro has
met Elian Gonzalez for the first time since the boy's return to
the island on June 28, "Granma," the Cuban government official
newspaper, said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Castro greeted the boy during his visit and congratulated him
on having been approved the first year of grade school only 15
days after the end of the normal course.
</P>
<P>
The minor's school year was interrupted when he was taken out
of the country illegally in November of 1999 to go to the United
States, a trip that ended in a wreckage in which his mother and
other 10 persons died.
</P>
<P>
Later Elian was separated from his social surroundings by a
dispute over the custody of the infant started between some
distant relatives in Miami, who supported by anti-Cuba exile
groups which pretended to keep the boy, and his father in Cuba,
with the result of school delay.
</P>
<P>
Elian received from Castro a copy of the book "The Golden Age"
written by Jose Marti, with an autograph. Castro wrote a
dedication in the book: "For your study in the fourth or fifth
grade and for your enjoyment of one of the most tender works of
Marti."
</P>
<P>
It was the first reported meeting between the Cuban leader and
Elian since the child returned from the United States on June 28.
Castro had pledged that Cuba would avoid making the center of a
media circus on his return to the island.
</P>
<P>
After the child was rescued on Nov. 25, a dispute over custody
between relatives in the United States and his father in Cuba
became a major international incident involving Castro and top U.S.
officials.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador To Have New Coins in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The new divisional coins will start
circulating in Ecuador by the first half of August, and the sucre
will disappear on September 13 as planned by the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador entered in April a "dollarization" process that uses as
its basis the U.S. currency and relegates the sucre to
transactions with its fractions.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank opened Saturday a point of exchange in every
one of the biggest commercial centers of Lima and will do the same
in other similar sites next week.
</P>
<P>
A total of 562,000 dollars in divisional coins were put in
circulation during the first semester of the year to compensate
the retirement of the national small change.
</P>
<P>
Some 305 million dollars in bills were exchanged -- 148
million dollars have not been exchanged yet -- and 7.5 million
dollars in fractions of the U.S. currency, said the "El Comercio"
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The problem of the forgery of bills has grown with the start of
the dollar circulation in all commerce operations.
</P>
<P>
The "La Hora" newspaper Saturday quoted official sources as
saying that besides some confiscations by the authorities of
dollar forgeries, police detained this week in the border with
Colombia a citizen of that country who was traveling to Quito in
an autobus with 52,000 dollars in falsified bills.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Warns Sierra Leonean Rebels Not to Oppose Rescue Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Saturday warned Sierra Leonean rebels not to oppose the
operation launched by the U.N. mission to rescue peacekeepers who
had been trapped by them since May this year.
</P>
<P>
More than 220 U.N. peacekeepers trapped in eastern Sierra
Leone broke out from their positions with the help of fellow
peacekeepers from the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (
UNAMSIL) Saturday morning and began fighting their way towards
safety.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his spokesman's office, Annan warned
the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) that it was in their
interest not to oppose this legitimate effort and hoped that
further violence can be avoided.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief stressed that the extraction operation was
aimed at ensuring the security of United Nations personnel and
restoring their freedom of movement.
</P>
<P>
"This morning, UNAMSIL lunched a military operation to extract
the 233 peacekeepers, who had been surrounded by the RUF at their
compound in Kailahun. The secretary-general is gratified that 40
of them have now been brought to safety and that the UNAMSIL
operation to bring the remaining 193 back to safe ground has made
good progress," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"However, the United Nations forces have yet to cover some
distance in a difficult area controlled by hostile rebels before
reaching the nearest United Nations base at Daru," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
"The use of force by UNAMSIL to extract its personnel from the
area has become inevitable. Indeed, for over two months, the RUF
maintained its illegal encirclement of the United Nations
peacekeepers at Kailahun and had prevented them from exercising
their freedom of movement, which is a fundamental principle in all
United Nations peacekeeping operations," the statement noted.
</P>
<P>
"Throughout this period, intensive diplomatic and political
efforts, at all levels, to ensure their security and restore their
freedom of movement by peaceful means were unsuccessful. Moreover,
the resupply of the surrounded peacekeepers has recently been
severely curtailed as a result of the increasingly threatening
posture adopted by the RUF and the deteriorating road conditions
in the area," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The peacekeepers were sent to Sierra Leone to monitor a peace
agreement and disarmament that was to have ended a civil war that
began in 1991.
</P>
<P>
But the RUF refused to disarm and took U.N. peacekeepers
hostage when they ventured to diamond-mining areas they control.

<HEADLINE> Alitalia Aims to Forge New Alliance With Foreign Airlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Alitalia, the Italian national
airline, plans to forge new alliances and rebuild its fleet to
reverse its current dismal trend which this year saw the first
semester balance push profits into negative ground, CEO Domenico
Cempella told union leaders here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Cempella said the first semester losses were due to a
combination of factors, including the broken accord with KLM Royal
Dutch Airlines and the sharp rise in oil prices which alone drove
operating costs up 150 million euros.
</P>
<P>
According to Cempella, the KLM break cost Alitalia more than
100 million euros and damaged the airline both because it
dramatically reduced the number of passengers and because of the
costs incurred in covering routes which previously had been
covered by the alliance.
</P>
<P>
Cempella also said that rising oil prices are making it more
and more difficult for smaller airlines to keep their heads above
water in a fiercely competitive market.
</P>
<P>
He added that Alitalia risks serving only a niche market or
becoming a secondary player if it cannot manage to find a new
partner and build up its fleet, especially of larger planes used
for intercontinental flights.
</P>
<P>
Alitalia has been dogged by problems since 1999, due largely to
the numerous delays in developing Milan's new Malpensa airport
into a fully operational international hub, a major factor leading
to the KLM break.

Although Alitalia openly announced its intention to search for
a new partner virtually the minute it was unceremoniously dumped
by KLM in April, so far no sure candidate has been announced.
</P>
<P>
Today, the CEO avoided reiterating the claim he made last month
that by the end of 2000 Alitalia profits would reach the 1999
levels, which that year registered consolidated net profits of 6
million euros, already a sharp fall from the previous year's 200
million profit.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Minister Expects Support From Mercosur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Canadian International Commerce
Minister Pierre Pettigrew, who ended Saturday a visit to Uruguay,
said that Mercosur "must accompany the process of integration of
the Americas."
</P>
<P>
Pettigrew, who met Friday in private with Uruguayan President
Jorge Batlle, said he is convinced that all the members of the
Southern Common Market (Mercosur) -- Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay
and Uruguay -- are opposed to "the closing into itself of the
region, but that they want it to remain open to all the countries
of the hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
The official said that Mercosur can continue with its policy of
integrating all the economies of the region, but must also try to
insert itself into the Free Trade Association of the Americas (
FTAA).
</P>
<P>
Pettigrew also said that it is necessary to work hard for the
projected FTAA to be completed in 2005.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian minister said at the end of his visit that his
government plans to increase the present level of trade with
Uruguay and acknowledged the commitment of this country with the
FTAA development.
</P>
<P>
Battle said Wednesday that Mercosur should be used as an
instrument to integrate all America, because the circumstances are
appropriate to implement "a fast growth of the region."

<HEADLINE> Cubans Demand End to U.S. Cuban Adjustment Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Some 20,000 Cuban demonstrators
demanded Saturday the derogation by the United States of a law
that grants automatic asylum to Cubans who abandon the island.
</P>
<P>
Revolutionary Armed Forces Minister and No. 2 leader in Cuba
Raul Castro attended the rally held in La Maquina, 900 kilometers
east of Havana.
</P>
<P>
"Down with the Cuban Adjustment Act" and "Down with the
blockade" were some of the slogans shouted by the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban authorities said that the Cuban Adjustment Act
promulgated by the U.S. government encourages Cubans to emigrate
illegally to U.S. territory.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1994 and 1995 immigration accords, 20,000 Cubans are
allowed to immigrate to the United States legally.
</P>
<P>
In line with those accords, Cubans trying to enter the United
States illegally who are intercepted at sea must be returned to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
But unlike other illegal immigrants, Cubans who manage to evade
the Coast Guard and reach U.S. shores are allowed to seek legal
residency and work permits under the so-called Cuban Adjustment
Act.

<HEADLINE> Three U.S. Senators Visit Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of three United States
senators is visiting Havana Saturday to know first hand the
interest of the Cuban government in the normalization of relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The three legislators who arrived Friday are led by Max Baucus,
a Democrat for the state of Montana, and is made up of Daniel
Akaka, a Democrat from Hawaii, and Pat Roberts, a Republican of
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
Baucus was one of the sponsors in May of a bill of law aimed at
derogating the U.S. laws that affect the relations with the island.
</P>
<P>
The visitors expect to hold talks during their brief visit with
senior Cuban government officials, and they will offer a press
conference Sunday afternoon, a little before their return to their
country.
</P>
<P>
The visit occurs two months after two Democrat congressmen for
the state of Kansas, Senator Blanche Lincoln, and representative
Marion Berry, explored the possibility of business in the island,
together with a delegation of rice producers from that country.
</P>
<P>
Several delegations from different levels of the U.S. society
have toured the island this year and have stated their support for
the establishment of normal links between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
After the return to Cuba on June 28 of boy Elian Ginzalez, who
was the bone of contention between Washington and Havana, the
government presided over by Fidel Castro has centered its efforts
in ending the trade embargo and the derogation of other anti-Cuba
laws imposed by the United States.

<HEADLINE> Students Conflict Worsens Dominican Republic Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The social situation in the
Dominican Republic worsened Saturday with the paralyzation of the
Santo Domingo Autonomous University by orders of the authorities.
</P>
<P>
Rector Miguel Rosado suspended faculty and administrative
activities for 48 hours, after disgruntled students occupied the
campus of the institution, according to reports reaching here from
Santo Domingo, the Dominican Republic's capital.
</P>
<P>
The Dominican Students Federation (FED) demonstrators protested
the increase by a little more than 1.50 dollars the registration
fee for the summer course offered every year by that university.
</P>
<P>
Rosado said that the students' demand is illogical because the
increase of the registration fee to reduce in part the budget
deficit of the university is far below the real cost of the course,
estimated at five dollars.
</P>
<P>
The FED leadership warned that they will continue to occupy the
areas until the rector discusses with the organization the fee
increase established by the university council, while the council
announced that it is studying sanctions to be applied to those
students.
</P>
<P>
The dispute in the university occurs in the middle of political
confrontations between the transition commissions formed by the
Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) and the government.

The People's Defenders said in a report published this week
that 235 massacres were committed in Colombia during the first
semester of 2000 with a result of 1,073 victims.
