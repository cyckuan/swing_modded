<HEADLINE> Mandela Rules Out Further Cabinet Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 31 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today ruled out further cabinet changes in the
near future and said he was satisfied with the performance of the
present team.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a choir competition in Cape Town,
Mandela said he did not envisage another cabinet change after
Thursday's reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Mandela announced on Thursday that Finance Minister Chris
Liebenberg had resigned, Posts and Telecommunications Minister
Pallo Jordan had been dismissed from the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Minister Trevor Manuel would step into
Liebenberg's shoes in April, while Minister without Portfolio Jay
Naidoo would take over Jordan's post, according to Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Jordan's dismissal, Mandela said it was a step
that ''i regretted very much''.
</P>
<P>
''He was one of our most competent ministers but I had to
comply with the constitution,'' said Mandela, adding the decision
to axe Jordan was taken by himself alone.
</P>
<P>
Mandela also said he was discussing Jordan's new assingment
but did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Jordan has already declined an
ambassadorial post to Japan and is considering heading a
parastatal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Liebenberg's resignation and the ensuing cabinet
reshuffle have resulted in the African National Congress (ANC)
having an extra minister than constitutionally allowed.
</P>
<P>
The ANC has 18 ministers in the government of national unity,
while the National Party has six and the Inkatha Freedom Party
has three.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Protests Greece over Islet Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today lodged a protest
against Greece following a Greek boat dropping a man on a
disputed Aegean islet.
</P>
<P>
The Greek ambassador to Turkey was summoned to the Foreign
Ministry and was protested over the "provocative" act, said a
written statement issued by the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The statement said a Greek fishing boat this morning dropped a
man on the disputed Aegean islet, called Kardak in Turkish and
Imia in Greek.
</P>
<P>
A Turkish coast security boat patrolling in the region
informed nearby Greek coast security vessels of the incident, but
the latter took no prevention, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the Turkish side exercised great restraint and
the Greek boatman left the islet some half an hour later.
</P>
<P>
"In a period that Turkey makes efforts to solve the problems
with Greece in a friendly manner, it is impossible to tolerate
such an act clearly infringing the agreement as a result of the
mediation of the United States," the Foreign Ministry claimed.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece staged a military confrontation over the
disputed Aegean islet at the end of last January.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. intervened and prevented a possible military conflict
between the two NATO members at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
Both Turkey and Greece have agreed to stay away from the islet
until the dispute is settled peacefully.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have long-standing disputes over territorial
waters and other rights in the Aegean Sea and over the divided
Mediterranean island country of Cyprus.

<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Algerian Foreign Minister Ahmed
Attaf has described the agreement on nuclear disarmament of
Africa, due to be concluded in Cairo on April 11, as an important
event that signifies Africa's contribution in the establishment of
world peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Attaf also asserted Algeria's adherence to the use of nuclear
energy for peaceful purposes, according to local press reports
today.
</P>
<P>
He made this statement following his signature Saturday of an
accord on the safeguards of the use of atomic energy with
Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
Hans Blix.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Algeria is satisfied with its cooperation
with the IAEA, expressing hope that the scope of bilateral
cooperation will expand and diversify in the future.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the situation in the Middle East, Attaf said
this region is quite sensitive, thus necessitating nuclear
disarmament particularly because Israel's nuclear arms provoke
troubles and distort the regional balance of power.
</P>
<P>
On his part, the IAEA director-general said he was pleased with
the signing of the accord by Algeria, pointing out that the IAEA
attaches importance to its scientific cooperation with this
African country.

DAMASCUS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti Fund for Arab
Economic Development will extend a loan of 7.65 million Kuwaiti
dinars (about 26 million U.S. dollars) to Syria to finance the
establishment of two electricity transformation stations,

Syrian capital. Initial work is expected to begin shortly, to be
completed early in 1999.

statements, emphasizing the deep relationship between Syria and
Kuwait and their respective genuine desire to promote bilateral
ties in the various fields.
</P>
<P>
With the conclusion of this agreement, the Kuwaiti Fund will
have extended 20 loans to Syria, amounting to 191.65 million
Kuwaiti dinars (651 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Libya Returns Three Egyptian Hijackers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Libya today handed over to Egypt
the three hijackers who commandeered an EgyptAir plane to Libya
last Wednesday, it was reported today.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Middle East News Agency (MENA) said the three
Egyptian hijackers, Mohammed Mahmoud Hamid, 42, his son and
nephew, were brought back to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
It added that extradition came within the context of the
agreements concluded between Egypt and Libya in the security
fields.
</P>
<P>
MENA earlier today quoted Information Minister Safwat el-Sherif
as saying that Libyan Leader Muammar Gaddafi had also ordered to
turn over to Egypt all documents related to investigations on the
incident.
</P>
<P>
The Airbus A320, en route from the Saudi city of Jeddah to
Cairo with a stopover in Egypt's southern resort city of Luxor,
was seized before landing at the Cairo airport. The hijackers
later surrendered to the Libyan authorities.
</P>
<P>
The three men had reportedly claimed that they wanted to
present a message from God to Gaddafi, Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and U.S. President Bill Clinton, demanding a lifting of
the Israeli closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Interior Minister Hassan el-Alfy has said that Hamid,
the owner of a restaurant in Luxor, was a drug addict who was
mentally deranged.
</P>
<P>
The passengers and the plane were returned to Egypt last
Thursday.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Israel has decided to set up a
Ministerial Committee to consider taking economic steps to
alleviate hardships of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip
and West Bank due to the five-week closure.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said the decision was made at a cabinet meeting
this morning, but the government failed to adopt further measures
to ease the restrictions on the closure.
</P>
<P>
The team will see to it that sufficient supplies of food and
medicine in the Gaza Strip and West Bank are ensured and exports
of Palestinian goods are allowed.
</P>
<P>
The committee is also authorized to make decisions on behalf of
the government. Israeli Minister of Public Security Moshe Shahal
was appointed to head the team which also includes Environment
Minister Yossi Sarid, Agriculture Minister Ya'acov Tsur and Deputy
Defense Minister Ori Orr.
</P>
<P>
The closure, imposed following a wave of suicide bombing
attacks in Israeli since February 25, has had a devastating impact
on the Palestinian economy.
</P>
<P>
Both private and public sectors have been completely paralyzed
as a result. The Palestinian Authority has called for an immediate
session of the U.N. Security Council to address the matter. The PA
has also called on the Arab League "to support the Palestinian
position for convening the meeting of the Security Council," said
PA Information Minister Yasser Abed-Rabbo Saturday.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Pakistanis daily generate
48,000 tons of solid waste, out of which 19,170 tons come from
cities, said Amjad Ali from Food Technology, Agricultural
University, in the eastern industrial city of Faisalabad today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Associated Press of Pakistan, he said that the
southern port city of Karachi alone discharges some 300 million
gallons of sewage a day and Lahore, metropolis of Punjab produces
240 million gallons.
</P>
<P>
The only sewage treatment plants are found in Islamabad and
Karachi, he added. For all practical purposes, essentially all
urban sewage outside Islamabad is discharged raw and untreated.
</P>
<P>
Waste disposal often takes 20-25 percent of a city's budget,
although only about half of the wastes are collected, Amjad Ali
said.
</P>
<P>
Only half the human waste in cities makes its way to sewers,
the rest is deposited on the roadside, dumped in water-ways, or
incorporated in solid waste.
</P>
<P>
Given the general failure of municipal collection of wastes,
the doctor suggested that garbage collection be handed over to the
private sector in the form of the extensive network of scavengers.

ISLAMABAD, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Steel, the country's
national steel company, achieved a landmark when for the first
time its capacity utilization touched 100 percent this month, said
the official Associated Press of Pakistan today.
</P>
<P>
At the same time the company registered a record sale of over
1.35 billion rupees (38.9 million US dollars) during the same
period, 350 million rupees (10.1 million dollars) more than the
last highest sale achieved in February this year.
</P>
<P>
The Board of Director of the Pakistan Steel which met today in
the southern port city of Karachi, where the company located,
praised this all time high performance of its mill.
</P>
<P>
The directors congratulated the officers and workers of the
steel mill for their unparalleled achievement.
</P>
<P>
In the annual general meeting of the company today, Chairman of
 Pakistan Steel Usman Farooqi said that this achievement became
possible only through team work and dedicated efforts of the
mill's officers and workers.
</P>
<P>
He said it was due to their dedicated efforts that the capacity
utilization increased from 14 percent in early December 1995 to 83
percent in January 1996, 86 percent in February and finally 100
percent in March.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned Pakistan Steel, which started production in
1981, is the largest steel company in the country.

<P>
DALIAN, March 31 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese official today urged
local governments to accelerate the pace of improving state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhongyu, minister of the State Economic and Trade
Commission, emphasized at a seminar held here that annexation and
bankruptcy must be used in enterprises that have been losing money
for a long time, and have no hope of recovery.
</P>
<P>
He noted that annexation and bankruptcy have been put high on
the list of enterprise reforms to be tried out in 50 cities and
told local governments that they should do a good job in
arranging employees of those enterprises in difficulty, when
considering annexation or bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
About small businesses, he said that various measures should be
adopted to improve them and that they should be given more
freedom. Statistics show that 80 percent of enterprises that are
losing money are small ones.
</P>
<P>
A working conference on trying the modern enterprise system was
held from March 29 to 31 in Dalian. At that time, Wang and Guo
Tingbiao, vice-governor of northeast China's Liaoning Province did
some research on those companies in the city that were in bad
shape.

<HEADLINE> Special Program To Boost Farming Launched In Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Agricultural
Minister Teketel Forsido launched here today a special
agricultural extension program designed for areas with scarce
rainfall in an effort to benefit 10,000 farmers in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, the minister said the
program would be focused on areas with an average annual rainfall
of less than 700 milliliters.
</P>
<P>
Teketel said the special program was currently being
implemented in arid areas such as northern Amhara and Tigray
regions, eastern Dire Dawa region and southern Oromiya region.
</P>
<P>
He cited adopting appropriate farm tools, seed, fertilizer
application, farming system and extension of technology as
strategies to sustain productivity in those areas.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that the special program differed from
the agricultural promotion technique put in practice in areas
with sufficient rain.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports say the Ethiopian government had planned to
embrace 400,000 farmers in the special agricultural program this
year, compared with only 40,000 farmers last year.
</P>
<P>
The new plan indicated that 4 percent of the estimated 10
million farmers of the country would be embraced in government's
extension program this year.
</P>
<P>
High production obtained in areas where the regular program
was carried out in previous years had inspired the government
to embrace more farmers to the extension program this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another report said here today that preparations to
launch extension program in eastern Jijiga and Somali regions
had already been finalized.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Central Bank Cancels Inflation-proof Promise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China, the
country's central bank, will cancel its inflation-proof guarantees
for deposits of three to eight years as of tomorrow with approval
of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
According to a bank spokesman, price hikes for consumer goods
have been below the interest rate of three-year fixed deposits for
five consecutive months from October of 1995 to February this
year, indicating remarkable success in macro-economic controls and
commodity supplies in the market.
</P>
<P>
The bank resumed its inflation-compensating measures, with
subsidies for RMB deposits of three to eight years to protect
clients from interest lost to price increases, on July 11, 1993,
with approval from the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The bank will treat the inflation-curbing move as the primary
task to macro-economic controls, and keep the RMB's value stable,
in order to support sustained, fast, and healthy development of
the national economy, the spokesman said.

<P>
URUMQI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, which was recently hit by a strong earthquake
measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale, has been struck by heavy rains
and snowstorms since early Saturday morning, making life
extremely difficult for its people.
</P>
<P>
Gusting winds and heavy snowfalls have added insult to injury
for people in Goltograk and Gulluk townships of Jashi County in
Kashi Prefecture, lasting for as long as 30 hours.
</P>
<P>
The storms have killed 332 animals, and destroyed 689 houses
and 418 barns. Classes have been suspended for more than 5,000
students from 179 classes in 52 schools.
</P>
<P>
Many of the shelters for the earthquake victims are reported to
be leaking and a few have even been destroyed by the wind.
</P>
<P>
Work to prevent some of the moisture from draining off the land
and tending to the wheat fields has had to be suspended, and
outpatient clinics and some wings of two hospitals are reportedly
leaking as well.
</P>
<P>
County and village roads are muddy, preventing rescue vehicles
from getting through.
</P>
<P>
Local governments have provided 1.5 tons of waterproof plastic,
6,800 pieces of clothing, and 155 bags of flour for those who are
having the greatest difficulties.

<HEADLINE> Somali Faction Leader Aidid Militiamen Allign With His Rival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 31 (Xinhua) -- A group of 64 militiamen of
General Mohamed Farah Aidid defected to his rival Ali Mahdi
Mohamed yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Fiftyeight of them escaped to North Mogadishu controlled by
Ali Mahdi while the others went to Medina District of South
Mogadishu under the control of Ali Mahdi's supporters.
</P>
<P>
According to the commander of the defected group, Super
Attendant Gosar Issak Jesow, 35, his militiamen were sent to
Merca by Aidid to fight against Osman Atto's forces in the region
two weeks ago and he lost three of his men in the battle with
Osman Atto.
</P>
<P>
They defected because they were unwilling to be involved in a
bloody fighting between Habar Gidir militiamen.
</P>
<P>
''We were all reluctant to fight against people whom we even
don't know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Jesow told reporters in North Mogadishu today that his men had
suffered malnourishment. ''We were fed only twice a day with
maize and sorghum, the poorest food one could live on, ''he said.
</P>
<P>
While Jesow was speaking to reporters, dozens of his men
wearing the militia uniform of General Aidid were standing beside
him. One of them, Aden Ahmed, 16, said they are ready to fight
against Aidid whom he described as "war criminal". ''I hope all
my colleagues will do the same,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The defected group, who are mainly from Rahanwein tribe and
support Deputy President of the Aidid administration, Colonel
Mohamed Nur Aliyow, characterized the militia policy of Aidid as
a total discrimination.
</P>
<P>
''General Aidid prioritize his clansmen, Habar Gidir from the
rest, while the Murusade men are the next to his. But our
Rahanwein militiamen are always less dignified,'' said Jesow.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 31 (Xinhua) -- At least 348 people had died of
malaria in Zimbabwe so far this month, Secretary for Health and
Child Welfare Ministry Rufaro Chatora said today.
</P>
<P>
Chatora said his ministry had spent an extra 166,700 U.S.
Dollars on an intensified Malaria Control Program due to an
increase of over 350 percent in fatal cases since last year.
</P>
<P>
He voiced the government's concern about the further rise of
malaria cases.
</P>
<P>
"The main reason why we are having so many deaths from the
disease is that people present the disease too late and because
of that they have complications which can either be renal
shutdown or cerebral malaria," he added.
</P>
<P>
The secretary said people visiting malaria endemic areas from
cities during the coming Easter holidays should ensure that they
were protected as failure to do so might lead to a worse epidemic
in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Government subsidies have
played an active role in keeping the price of goods in China's
capital, stable for consumers, but the subsidies in the
municipality are too high.
</P>
<P>
Beijing will adopt measures to solve its financial problems
from subsidies, Jin Renqing, vice-mayor of the municipality, said
today at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1995, municipal revenue were 21.4
billion yuan, and the subsidies ran as high as 7.16 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Jin said that such a large amount of subsidy is a difficult
burden for the municipality to bear. "It's a long road ahead in
solving the problem, but some measures should be adopted," he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-mayor said that in the future the subsidies will be
mainly provided for low-income residents, rather than for all
residents.
</P>
<P>
In this way, Jin said, Beijing's subsidies can be gradually
brought down to an appropriate level and the city will improve
finance management and supervision.
</P>
<P>
He said that measures regulating the price of commodities and
strengthening the management of subsidy funds will be adopted, and
the range of subsidies will be adjusted to some extent.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Generate 48,000 tons of Solid Waste Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Pakistanis daily generate
48,000 tons of solid waste, out of which 19,170 tons come from
cities, said Amjad Ali from Food Technology, Agricultural
University, in the eastern industrial city of Faisalabad today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Associated Press of Pakistan, he said that the
southern port city of Karachi alone discharges some 300 million
gallons of sewage a day and Lahore, metropolis of Punjab produces
240 million gallons.
</P>
<P>
The only sewage treatment plants are found in Islamabad and
Karachi, he added. For all practical purposes, essentially all
urban sewage outside Islamabad, is discharged raw and untreated.
</P>
<P>
Waste disposal often takes 20-25 percent of a city's budget,
although only about half of the wastes are collected, Amjad Ali
said.
</P>
<P>
Only half the human waste in cities makes its way to sewers,
the rest is deposited on the roadside, dumped in water-ways, or
incorporated in solid waste.
</P>
<P>
Given the general failure of municipal collection of wastes,
the doctor suggested that garbage collection be handed over to the
private sector in the form of the extensive network of scavengers.

SHANGHAI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- China issued its first magnetic
cards for use on its trains, in the country's largest metropolitan
business center today.
</P>
<P>
The "Shangtie Dragon Card," the brainchild of the Shanghai
Railway Bureau and the Construction Bank of China, is the first of
its kind for use on the major forms of transportation.
</P>
<P>
For a purchase price of 300 yuan, the first 3,000 of the cards
will be available for use on the "Xianxing" (First Trip) fast
train which makes its first run on the Shanghai-Nanjing railway
line tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Travelers can use the cards in special machines that give the
passenger the number of his or her seat and other information, and
allow the person to go directly to the train, free from other
boarding procedures.
</P>
<P>
Railway authorities cited the move as a major change in the
current ticketing system, and much more convenient for travelers.
</P>
<P>
Many people buying the card told Xinhua that they would treat
the cards, with their unique design, as precious souvenirs.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Senior Economist On Selling State Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 31 (Xinhua) -- A senior economist in Zimbabwe on
Sunday said the commercialization of state-owned enterprises
would ease pressure on the government's overstretched budget.
</P>
<P>
The senior economist of the Zimbabwe National Chamber of
Commerce (ZNCC), Edmore Tobaiwa, said divestiture by the
government in state-owned enterprises would maximize viability of
these entities, thereby easing pressure on the government to
subsidize parastatal operations.
</P>
<P>
''Commercialization of state owned enterprises should not be
viewed as a means of laying off workers, but rationalization of
operations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the economic reforms in 1991, Zimbabwe had
commercialized most of its agro-based parastatals except the
grain marketing board, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Post and Telecommunications Corporation was recently
commercialized to fall into the same streamline with the other
commercialized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
''To bring in efficiency and profit maximization in these
companies in the second phase of the economic reforms the
government should privatize them,'' he said.

KATHMANDU, March 31 (Xinhua) -- A discussion program was
organized here today to collect suggestions over women's equal
rights to property in Nepal as the government would introduce a
relevant bill later this year.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali supreme court earlier issued a directive to the

The discussion program, sponsored by a local legal center and a

The supreme court had also asked the government to hold such
consultations with social workers and legal experts over the bill
and to study legal systems in other countries regarding women's
rights to property.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's 1991 constitution provides equal rights for women to
property inheritance, but so far there is no specific law in this

<HEADLINE> Sino-Pak Traditional Friendship Advances Steadily  (by Pan Yi) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 31 (Xinhua) -- May 21, 1996 will witness the
45 anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between
China and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
With the joint efforts made by the two governments and peoples,
the Sino-Pakistan friendship has been developing to maturity step
by step, which has become a model for countries with different
social systems to develop their relations.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the history, one can discover four characteristics in
the process of the development of Sino-Pakistan friendly ties.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, both countries are developing countries, which have
the common tasks of safeguarding state sovereignty and developing
national economy.
</P>
<P>
Both countries have similar historical experiences of
colonialist plunder and exploitation, so they have sympathized and
supported each other in their struggle against hegemonism and
power politics.
</P>
<P>
All these have served as the basis of the mutually beneficial
and reciprocal cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the frequent exchanges of high-level visits between
the two countries have contributed a lot to the consolidation of
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng, Chairman of the National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Li Ruihuan,
and Chairman of the Chinese National People's Congress Qiao Shi
visited Pakistan in 1989, 1993 and 1995 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani President Farooq Leghari visited China at the end of
1994, and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto paid three visits to China
in 1988, 1993, and 1995 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, economic cooperation based on the principle of mutual
benefit has played an important role in furthering Sino-Pakistan
friendship.
</P>
<P>
In today's world, the economic factor has become more and more
prominent in state-to-state relations and most countries have
taken it as a top priority to develop national economy.
</P>
<P>
Since 1960s, China has provided Pakistan with about 2.5 billion
Renminbi Yuan (about 310 million US dollars at current exchange
rate) of free aid and loans.
</P>
<P>
And the bilateral trade also grew steadily with the trade
volume exceeding 1 billion dollars last year, setting a new
historical record.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the two countries are actively exploiting and
expanding economic cooperation in the fields of technology, labor,
contract projects and joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
Fourthly, China and Pakistan have maintained close cooperation
in international issues, on which the two countries often hold
identical or similar views.
</P>
<P>
In 1950s when China was blocked by certain superpowers,
Pakistan was a channel for China to link up with the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
In 1960s, Pakistan made great contributions for the restoration
of China's legal seat in the UN.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Pakistan has been strongly supporting China on the
issues of human rights, Taiwan, Tibet, Hong Kong, etc.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Zhang Chengli said here today:
"It is the firm and unshakable policy of the Chinese government to
further strengthen and develop its relations with Pakistan," he
stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
NASA, or National Aeronautics and Space Administration, had
shortened the flight by one day, opting for a Saturday landing
instead of Sunday because of the hydraulic system problem that
appeared during the March 22 launch. However, the skies there
Saturday morning were overcast and forced NASA gave up its landing
plan.
</P>
<P>
The crises with the cargo bay doors began shortly after NASA
passed on the landing attempts Saturday morning and Atlantis almost
had to make an emergency landing when the doors would not open in
orbit and allow heat to radiate from the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
The astronauts accomplished all their objectives scheduled for the
mission. They dropped off Shannon Lucid on Mir, exchanged about 5,000
kilograms of water, experiment equipment and other supplies between
Mir and the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
In addition, astronauts Linda Godwin and Michael "Rich" Clifford
conducted a six-hour spacewalk to attach four experiment cases to
the station and tested new tethers and foot platform.
</P>
<P>
It was the first American spacewalk outside the Mir and the
first time NASA astronauts had worked outside any station since
Skylab in 1974.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Offers to Halt Military Offensive in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 31 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin today
announced that Russian forces would halt their offensive in rebel
Chechnya from midnight (2000 GMT) today and start a partial
withdrawal from some areas, but warned that Chechen separatist
fighters would be hit hard if they stage "terrorist" attacks.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said in a nationwide televised address that the federal
forces will withdraw stage-by-stage from "peaceful areas" to the
Chechen border areas.
</P>
<P>
The initiative, approved by the Russian Security Council on
March 15, is intended to end the 15-month fighting in the
mountainous region of Chechnya and boost Yeltsin's chances of
re-election in June.
</P>
<P>
He also made clear that some Russian forces would stay in
Chechnya and respond to any attacks from the rebels.
</P>
<P>
"Of course we will not tolerate terrorist actions. Responses
to them will be adequate. The security of Russian citizens must
be strictly maintained," he said.
</P>
<P>
Free and democratic elections of parliamentary members will be
held in Chechnya, Yeltsin said in the speech.
</P>
<P>
He said the main problem remaining is the status of the rebel
republic and stressed that Chechnya must stay within the Russian
Federation.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin offered to resume talks with the separatist fighters
through intermediaries. Negotiations broke down amid mutual
recriminations last December after a shaky ceasefire collapsed.
</P>
<P>
"The main condition under which negotiations on the status in
Chechnya could be started is normalizing the situation in the
republic and establishing peace, calm and stability there,"
Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president said Russia may grant amnesty to
combatants of Chechen separatist leader Dzhokhar Dudayev, but said
it would exclude those who have committed grave war crimes.
</P>
<P>
Russia sent troops to the Caucasus region in December 1994 in
a bid to crush the separatist drive led by Dudayev.

SHANGHAI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- A research center has been
founded in China's largest economic center to look into the
possibilities for enterprise reforms.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
On the list of topics will be problems involving management,
annexation, bankruptcy, regrouping, and group corporation
development.

<HEADLINE> Sunflower to Be Sown over 70,000 Acres in Punjab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Sunflower will be sown over
70,000 acres of land in Pakistan's Punjab province this year with
a production target of 91,000 tons, said a report from the Punjab
Agriculture Department today.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the National Oilseed Development Board
(NODB) officials, the target of 172,000 acres sowing sunflower in
Punjab, a main producer of the country's agricultural products,
for the spring sowing could not be achieved.
</P>
<P>
Reasons for the failure were stated as high prices of the
sunflower seed, low marketing facilities for the sunflower
production and the delayed rainfall in the main area of sunflower
growing.
</P>
<P>
The report said sunflower crop was sown over 45,310 acres of
land last year and the yield stood at 61,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Sunflower, one of the major non-traditional oilseed crops, is
being promoted by the federal government under NODB project to cut
huge foreign exchange bills being spent on the import of the
edible oil.
</P>
<P>
About 11.4 million tons of edible oil was imported in last
fiscal year to meet the edible oil needs of the 130 million
population of the country, at a cost of 32 billion rupees (922
million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The edible oil consumption is increasing in Pakistan at a rate
of 10 percent every year.

</P>
<P>

During its two-day visit to Tehran, the delegation will hold
talks with Iranian officials on issues of mutual interest
including Iran-EU economic ties as well as key regional and
international issues.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pakistan "Look East" for Economic Growth (by Gong Min) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto during her recent visit to Brunei and Indonesia
said Pakistan had adopted a "Look East" policy.
</P>
<P>
This decision to focus on Southeast Asia and the Far East can
be called a turning point in Pakistan's foreign economic
relations.
</P>
<P>
For the last five decades since its independence in 1947,
Pakistan's endeavors for trade and investment had mainly been
directed towards North America and Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of oil boom in the Middle East and the Persian
Gulf, Pakistan developed close economic and commercial relations
with the Muslim countries of West Asia, Arabian Peninsula and
North Africa.
</P>
<P>
However, no serious effort was made to take advantage of the
fast-growing opportunities for trade and investment in the
countries of East, Southeast Asia and Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
In the past 30 years or so, some East and Southeast Asian
countries have witnessed fast growing economies, which give these
countries the title of economic "Tigers" and "Giants".
</P>
<P>
The region possesses a vast economic potential and a bright
future prospects, having much superior edge over Europe and
America both in terms of population and land mass.
</P>
<P>
The average annual growth rate of the major Asian countries is
higher than that of the developed countries in the last 10 year.
</P>
<P>
The pace of industrialization is in full swing in Asia and in
the coming century Asia will be the leading continent of the
world.
</P>
<P>
The move to "Look East" reflects Pakistan's growing interest in
the Asian market.
</P>
<P>
The decision will greatly benefit the economy of the country.
</P>
<P>
As stated by Commerce Secretary Salman Frouqi in an interview,
there are bright prospects of expanded economic cooperation
between Pakistan and the countries of Asia as there are no quota
restrictions on imports in these countries.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Pakistan will expand her trade ties and commercial
links, particularly exports, with these countries.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan can export, among other things, cotton, cotton yarn,
carpets, rice, a variety of fruit, garment to Southeast and East
Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Not only can Pakistan have a lucrative trade with the emerging
Asian economies but also look forward to the enormous investment
opportunities from these countries.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan offers investment friendly opportunities to foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
For example, foreign investors can have 100 percent equity
stake and do not need to establish partnerships with local
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
They are also allowed to repatriate all of their profits to
their countries of origin.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the open investment policy, foreign investments
in Pakistan has tripled to 1.6 billion US dollars in the fiscal
year 1994-95 as against 443 million dollars in 1992-93.
</P>
<P>
As the first step of "Look East" policy, the Prime Minister
visited Japan, Brunei and Indonesia this year and memoranda of
understanding worth more than two billion dollars in trade and
investment have been signed with these countries.
</P>
<P>
Besides attracting investment, she also sought the Southeast
Asian countries' support in joining the Association of South-East
Asian Nation (ASEAN) and the Asia Pacific Economic cooperation
(APEC).
</P>
<P>
Benazir observed that whereas 19th century belonged to Britain
and 20th century was dominated by the United States, the 21st
century belongs to Asia.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is determined to enter the 21st century in close
cooperation with the Asian economies.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Capital's Economic Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan announced
his determination to invigorate the Chinese capital's economy
during the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), with concrete ideas
for industrial restructuring.
</P>
<P>
In a government work report submitted, here today, for the
fourth session of the tenth municipal people's congress, Li
pointed out that the city should consolidate agriculture, improve
the manufacturing industry, and speed up expansion of the service
industry.
</P>
<P>
Li suggested that priority be given to agricultural
development, and that of sideline products, the processing
industry, automobiles, machinery and equipment, building,
commerce, finance, securities, tourism, transportation, postal
service, telecommunications, and information service.
</P>
<P>
The city will be separated into five industrial belts:
</P>
<P>
-- The city proper, within the third ring road, as a center of
politics and culture, and mainly for service industry development;
</P>
<P>
-- The Haidian, Fengtai, and Changping districts, listed as
high-tech and new development zones;
</P>
<P>
-- The outskirts, as an economic belt open to overseas
investors;
</P>
<P>
-- The more distant suburbs, to be used for comprehensive
economic development; and
</P>
<P>
-- A tourism belt, formed by many scenic suburban areas.
</P>
<P>
He expects an annual growth rate of three percent in the
capital's agricultural output value over the five-year period,
eight percent in that of manufacturing, and ten percent for the
service industry.
</P>
<P>
This also means that the primary, secondary, and tertiary
industries will account for 4.5, 45.5, and 50 percent,
respectively, of Beijing's gross domestic product by the year
2000, and the rates will be adjusted to 2.6, 42.4, and 55 percent
by 2010, the mayor noted.

TOKYO, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen and his Japanese counterpart Yukihiko Ikeda held talks here
today on bilateral relations and a wide range of international
issues, a Chinese official said.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who is also Chinese Vice-Premier, arrived in Tokyo

</P>
<P>
During the talks that lasted nearly three hours, Ikeda assured

Ikeda reaffirmed to Qian that Japan will continue to abide by
the two agreements as they are the political foundation for the
two neighboring countries to promote the development of bilateral
relations, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda said Japan will work hard to build future-oriented
relations with China based on Tokyo's remorse over the past, and
will continue to support China's ongoing reform efforts and help
the country with its modernization program.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed satisfaction over the smooth development of
bilateral relations, noting that the exchange of visits by leaders
of the two countries over recent years has helped deepen mutual
understanding and friendship, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Progress has also been made in trade and economic cooperation
as well as in other fields, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Touching on Japan's wartime atrocities, Qian said it is
important for Japan to envisage the past if it wants to see
bilateral relations develop healthly, the official said. "Past
experience, if not forgotten, will serve as a guide for the
future," the official quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister said his government was satisfied
with a Japanese government statement issued by then Prime Minister
Tomiichi Murayama in August last year expressing Japan's remorse
over the past.
</P>
<P>
Qian, However, warned of a tendency in Japan that some
politicians have been trying to justify the nation's acts of
aggression during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda replied that the Japanese government will deal with the
issue of historical perception properly in line with the Murayama
statement, the official said.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in the Taiwan Straits, Qian urged Japan to
understand the Chinese stand on the issue and never do things that
will hinder China's reunification process and harm the feelings of
the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
In a response, Ikeda said Japan will stick to its "one-China"
policy and will limit its relations with Taiwan to
non-governmental contacts in line with the 1972 joint statement.
</P>
<P>
Qian also urged Japan to take measures to dispose of as soon as
possible the remains of chemical weapons left behind in China by
Japanese aggressor troops during the wartime.

<HEADLINE> New Foreign Exchange Rules Going into Effect in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- New regulations concerning the
control of foreign exchange will take effect on April 1, according
to a decree signed by Chinese Premier Li Peng on January 29, which
is made public today.
</P>
<P>
The "Provisional Regulations for Exchange Control of the
People's Republic of China" released on December 18, 1980 will be
no longer valid.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations specify the relatively lax terms for the
controls on foreign exchange and have almost no restrictions on
receipts and payments in foreign exchange in certain accounts,
while stricter controls are placed on receipts and payments in
capital accounts.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the new regulations attach importance to supervision
of financial institutions involving foreign exchange risks.
</P>
<P>
Experts here say that the new regulations will help legalize
foreign exchange, consolidate the reforms of the foreign exchange
system, maintain a balance between the country's international
receipts and payments, promote the development of international
trade, improve supervision and management of finance, thus
proceeding to help the process of conditional convertibility of
Renminbi yuan in current accounts.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration of Exchange Control announced that 66
regulations, including those on the use of foreign exchange by
citizens going abroad remain in effect.
</P>
<P>
To implement the new regulations, China recently sorted out
regulations on foreign exchange from January 1, 1980 to March 20,
1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
DONGGUAN, Guangdong, Eastern China, March 31 (Xinhua) -- August
First scored an easy victory of 97-63 over Guangdong Hongyuan to
win the first leg of the Chinese Basketball League final here on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yudong had 31 points and 11 rebounds to pace August First
for the win as Wang Zhizhi added 14 and Zhang Jinsong contributed
13.
</P>
<P>
August First, last year's national champions, dominated the
match from the start and led the first half 49-31.
</P>
<P>
The second half saw aging Hongyuan lost steam and made many
unforced errors, while August First continued its scoring blitzs.
</P>
<P>
Both Guan Deyou and Ma Yongzhong scored 17 points for Hongyuan,
followed by Wang Huaiyu with 11.
</P>
<P>
"We had done good homeworks and designed effective tactic and
strategy," said August First's coach Wang Fei. "We had a lot of
players available to offset Guangdong's home advantage."
</P>
<P>
Guangdong coach Wang Lifa said he had too many players who were
kept off the court by injuries.
</P>
<P>
"My players are older and their stamina inferior than August
First," he added.
</P>
<P>
The two teams will meet in the second leg in Shanghai next
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jinan Army won the seventh place by only one point
on aggregate despite its 87-82 overtime loss to Shenyang Army in
the second leg in Tieling.
</P>
<P>
Jinan, who took the first leg 63-57 at home, trailed Shenyang
34-45 at halftime but rallied to overtake the opponents 59-58 with
nine minutes in the second half.
</P>
<P>
The two sides tied at 75-75 after the second half. Shenyang
squandered a scoring opportunity with 29 seconds remaining and
took the gripping overtime by only five points, not enough to make
up for their away loss last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Yue Dapeng led five Shenyang scorers in double digit with 24
points. The other scorers were Zhao Lu (14), Zhao Renbin (13),
Zhang Yi (12) and Liu Deqiang (10).

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Manila to Integrate into Global Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The shift in the custom valuation
from home consumption value (HCV) to transaction value (TV) is
another step taken by Manila toward full integration into the
global economy.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Philippine President Fidel Ramos signed into law the
bill enabling the shift in custom valuation from the current HCV
to TV, one that is closer to world standard.
</P>
<P>
The shift is to be implemented beginning on July 1 this year
and would be done in two stages.
</P>
<P>
The bill envisions a transitional valuation based on export
value to an eventual system based on transactions value.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson said over the weekend,
"the shift in customs valuation could have initial negative
repercussions on government revenues."
</P>
<P>
It is nonetheless necessary if the country hopes to deepen its
trade with the rest of the world, he added.
</P>
<P>
Singson expected that the resulting lower valuation of imported
goods will eventually help reduce the general price level.
</P>
<P>
According to the Department of Finance, the shift in the
country's custom valuation from HCV to TV would result in a
revenue loss of some 15 billion pesos (600 million US dollars)
over two years.
</P>
<P>
However, Manila is confident that the initial revenue loss
would be fully recovered when there is an increase in transaction
volume on the third year of the measure's implementation or by
1999.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Law on Solid Waste Disposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- A law will take effect tomorrow,
April 1, that deals with the six billion tons of solid waste that
now exist in China and limits the production of solid waste in the
future.
</P>
<P>
The Solid Waste Prevention and Treatment Law is the country's
first comprehensive and systematic law of its kind, said Wang
Yangzu, deputy-director of the State Bureau of Environmental
Protection today.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Chinese industries produce 600 million tons
of solid waste each year, and urban residents discard more than
100 million tons of garbage a year, but only 40 percent of the
waste can be recycled or treated.
</P>
<P>
There are currently six billion tons of solid industrial waste
in China that have been left untreated.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the new law was designed with both prevention and
treatment in mind, but with emphasis being placed on the former.
</P>
<P>
China will stop importing plastic and rubber waste, according
to new regulations on importing solid waste, which will also take
effect tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The new law is a move to combat pollution, following on the
heels of the "Environmental Protection Law", "Law on Prevention
and Treatment of Air Pollution", and "Water Pollution Prevention
and Treatment Law", and was approved by the Standing Committee of
the National People's Congress last October.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Optimistic About Economic Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today remained confident and optimistic that the long-term
economic objectives of his government will be attained despite
"occasional setbacks" such as the 11.8 percent inflation rate last
month.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said he still foresees a single-digit inflation and a 6.5
to 7 percent growth in the gross national product (GNP) by
year-end "because of recent developments indicating that we are on
track."
</P>
<P>
"We are going to attain our economic goals for the long term,
that I can assure you," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He cited the following factors as the basis for his optimism:
</P>
<P>
-- Continued downtrend in the country's interest rate, mainly
because of the budget surplus for two consecutive years;
</P>
<P>
-- Steady purchasing power of the peso despite external shocks
such as the Mexican crisis;
</P>
<P>
-- Continued reduction of debt in the public sector;
</P>
<P>
-- Steadily growing gross international reserves which now
stand at 8.2 billion US dollars;
</P>
<P>
-- And Increased foreign investments thereby allowing the
country to accumulate hard currency for direct investments.
</P>
<P>
"All of these things contribute to the growth and stability of
our economy," the president said.

<HEADLINE> Yemeni President Accuses Eritrea of Blocking Solution to Island Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh
today accused Eritrea of blocking a peaceful solution to the
dispute between the two countries over three Red Sea islands.
</P>
<P>
Saleh, currently on a visit to Egypt, told reporters that
Eritrea has turned down all Arab and international mediations
aimed at solving the dispute peacefully.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference held with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak following their meeting, Saleh said he does not object to
hold a summit meeting with his Eritrean counterpart Isaias
Afewerki to solve the issue.
</P>
<P>
The dispute flared up last December when the two sides had a
fierce battle and Eritrean troops seized the island of Greater
Hanish, claimed by both countries. Yemen retains control of the
other two islands, Lesser Hanish and Zuqar. Both countries claim
ownership of all three islands.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and France have tried to help find a peaceful solution to
the dispute.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni president also said that his country has agreed to
release the 11 Egyptian fishing boats impounded due to their
"violation of fishing law."
</P>
<P>
He said that the way in which these boats were fishing would
damage environment and cause several problems, adding that the two
countries have agreed to hold a meeting to regulate fishing.
</P>
<P>
There is reportedly a widespread phenomenon of Egyptian fishing
boats entering the waters of neighboring states without any
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The government has often had to bail out Egyptian fishermen
detained abroad, especially in Yemen, Eritrea and Libya.
</P>
<P>
In their talks today, Mubarak and Saleh mainly discussed
bilateral relations, Yemeni-Eritrean dispute and Arab issues of
mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
At the joint press conference, both leaders lauded bilateral
ties and expressed hope that the cooperation relations could be
strengthened, particularly in the economic and trade fields.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Saleh today also witnessed the signing of an
agreement on cooperation in security fields between the two
nations.
</P>
<P>
Saleh arrived in Egypt Saturday on a two-day visit.

<HEADLINE> Manila Seeks More Aid from Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines is seeking
additional aid from Germany, its second largest source of official
development assistance, to finance a program to diversify exports
and promote small- and medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Secretary Rizalno Navarro said over the
weekend that he has written to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl about
the request for more technical and financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
He said Manila has also sought Germany's support for Manila's
trade concerns with the European Union, particularly its
long-standing request for Philippine seaweed to be reclassified as
a non-toxic food additive.
</P>
<P>
About 30,000 Filipinos depend on seaweed production and
processing for their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the Philippine embassy in Bonn, Kohl
is "willing to consider a new assistance package" for the
Philippines and is expected to announce this during his planned
visit to Manila in October.
</P>
<P>
Although Bonn has upgraded the Philippines' credit rating to a
level comparable to Malaysia's, the ceiling on Germany's financial
assistance to Manila remains at 100 million marks (70.4 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Indonesia is eligible to receive at least 900
million marks yearly, according to Philippine economic officials.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Manila has requested funding assistance to set up
special technology and cooperation centers, which will provide
vocational training and help German small- and medium-enterprises
planning to invest here.

CHONGQING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- An iron and steel conglomerate
in Chongqing, in southwest China's Sichuan Province, has become a
leader among state-owned enterprises in handing over control of
schools to the local government.
</P>
<P>
This development comes in light of the state policy of
separating government functions from enterprises management as
part of the effort to establish the modern enterprise system.
</P>
<P>
The Chongqing Iron and Steel (Group) Company reached an
agreement to turn over its 30 self-supporting schools to the local
government by the end of 1998 on the condition that the company
shoulder part of the funding.
</P>
<P>
The 100-year-old company is No.1 among all local state
enterprises, with nearly 50,000 employees, and puts 25 million
yuan into education annually.
</P>
<P>
China's state-owned enterprises now have a total of 18,000
self-supporting primary and middle schools, costing 4.5 billion
yuan yearly, not counting basic construction costs.
</P>
<P>
According to the policy of separating government functions from
enterprise management, China's state-owned enterprises will also
lighten their load of asset liabilities and surplus labor and to
shift responsibility for the hospitals and other services to
government departments concerned.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Electronics, machinery,
bio-engineering, and food have become four dominant industries in
the economic development zone in north China's port of Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Many electronics multinationals, such as Motorola, AT&AMP;T, and
Samsung have begun large projects in the zone to produce mobile
communications equipment, computers, semiconductors, and
integrated circuits, with the contractual investment totalling
nearly 1.4 billion US dollars, accounting for 25.5 percent of the
zone's total.
</P>
<P>
Contractual investment in the food industry in the zone hit 910
million US dollars, and output value in 1995 reached 8.8 billion
yuan (1.06 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Machinery projects, mainly for electronic machinery,
numerically-controlled machine tools, and automobile parts, had
3.2 billion yuan in output value in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Bio-engineering projects mainly involve making insulin and
fodder additives, and have contractual investment reaching 270
million US dollars.

<HEADLINE> More Elderly Propose Simplifying Funeral Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 31 (Xinhua) -- More than 800 elderly people in
Lucheng District of Wenzhou city in east China's Zhejiang
Province, ranging from 60 to 90 in age, called upon local
residents to simplify funeral and interment services.
</P>
<P>
With a prolonged tradition of building extravagant tombs,
Wenzhou now has 513 cemeteries and 89 graves, according to a
recent survey. But many of these graves are unoccupied as a few
locals like to build tombs during their lifetime.
</P>
<P>
The spending on tomb construction has also been rising with an
average of 10,000 yuan (1,205 US dollars) for each, and some even
cost tens of thousands of yuan and cover an area of hundreds of
square meters.
</P>
<P>
These aged people all agreed that the over-concentration of
tombs has not only brought damages to ecological environment but
also wasted a lot of money. They urged the elderly in the locality
to learn from former Premier Zhou Enlai whose ashes were scattered
around the country in accordance with his behest.
</P>
<P>
Their proposal has drawn enthusiastic response from the local
residents and construction of more than 2,000 graves in the
locality has been suspended.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Israeli Jet Fighters Fly Over Beirut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Israeli jet fighters flew over
Beirut today after carrying out reconnaissance flights over
Nabatiyeh and Iglim At-Tofah in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that the Israeli jet fighters flew over the
Lebanese capital at 11:45 am (8:45 GMT), making big noise by
breaking the sound barrier.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese army units and Syrian forces on the hills
overlooking the city kept a low profile by refraining from firing
anti-air weapons at the Israeli warplanes.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time for the Israeli jets to fly over Beirut
since this year.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in Western Beqaa also reported that Israeli
forces, from their position at Wadi Qamha in the Israeli
self-proclaimed "security zone" in south Lebanon, bombarded this
morning vicinities of the Lebanese villages of Seriri, Burka
Jabour and Qatrani.
</P>
<P>
The bombardments were accompanied by intensive flights at low
altitude over the area by Israeli helicopters.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation for the killing of two Lebanese civilians in
Israeli bombardments in south Lebanon later Saturday afternoon,
guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah or Party of God fired
28 Katyusha rockets in three batches into northern Israel over the
the night.
</P>
<P>
Two southern Lebanese villagers were killed and a third was
wounded by Israeli bombardments later Saturday afternoon, an event
described by the militant Hezbollah as a breach of a
U.S.-mediated 1993 understanding between Israel and the party.
</P>
<P>
Security sources reported that the two civilians, Ali Jafer,
23, and Fouad Qarni, 18, were killed when a house at the village
of Yater in Bint Jbail area was hit by an Israeli artillery shell.
</P>
<P>
The two victims were preparing a water tank in the house when
it was destroyed by the shell, the security sources noted.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli forces also shelled a number of other southern
Lebanese villages at the same time, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Moslem guerrillas lunched attacks Saturday morning at
two positions of the Israeli client militia in the
Israeli-occupied enclave in south Lebanon, but no casualties were
reported.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Syrian Amal movement claimed responsible for the
attacks in which, according to a statement issued by the
group, the guerrillas used machineguns and rockets.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah Hassan
Nasrallah described here Saturday night the killing of the
civilians at Yater by the Israeli forces as a violation of
a U.S.-mediated tacit agreement which put an end to an
Israeli blitz in south Lebanon in July, 1993.
</P>
<P>
Under the the agreement, which is known as the "July
Understanding," Israel promised to refrain from bombarding
southern Lebanese villages in exchange for a refrainment of
Hezbollah, or Party of God, from firing Katyusha rockets into
the northern Israel.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan President Asks Tamils To Reject rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan president Chandrika
Kumaratunga has appealed to Tamil parties and Tamil people to
speak out for peace and harmony and reject what she said is the
"terrorism "of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
Addressing a large gathering of the families of Security Forces
personnel killed or maimed in the civil war here Saturday,
Kumaratunga said Tamils themselves should marginalize the LTTE so
that a just and peaceful solution could be found.
</P>
<P>
She said the military effort was not against the Tamil people
but against the terrorism of the LTTE. The government was not
bent on pursuing a long-drawn-out war and it had told the military
high command that ultimately the military campaign would have to
make way for peace talks, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga added that the Tamil people must make clear to all
that the LTTE does not represent them and that it was only a
"terrorist movement" that should be defeated.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has long been plagued by problems involving both the
Sinhalese and Tamil-- the two major ethnic groups in the island
country.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE, an armed Tamil group, has been fighting a 13-year
guerrilla war for a separate Tamil state in the north and east of
the country.

<HEADLINE> Situation in Northern Israel Turns Quiet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The situation in northern
Israel has turned quiet following midnight Katyusha rocket
attack by Hezbollah (the Party of God) in the panhandle of the
western Galilee area, Israel Radio said this morning.
</P>
<P>
One woman was slightly injured and a minor damage was reported
during the Katyusha attack. Residents in the Galilee area spent
the night in the bomb-shelters. In reaction, the Israeli army
fired artillery at several Hezbollah bases in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah attack came in retaliation of the killing of two
Lebanese civilians and the injuring of a third in a south Lebanese
village last week.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres said Saturday night that
the killing of two civilians was an error.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah leader Sheikh Hasan Nasrallah said that the Israeli
attack was a violation of a ceasefire broked by the Americans in
1993, which stipulated that neither the Israeli army nor Hezbollah
should attack civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah warned residents in the Galilee to stay in
bombshelters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Foreign Minister Ehud Barak spoke Saturday
night with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to brief
him on the latest development in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Barak said that the killing of two Lebanese civilians was a
mistake and the Israeli army is making effort to ensure that this
type of attack does not reoccur.
</P>
<P>
The United States was reportedly using its influence to see
that the situation does not escalate. Syria, after being
contacted by the U.S., has also said that it is taking steps to
calm down the tension in the area.

<HEADLINE> Perry Calls for Full Compliance Of Dayton Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, March 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of Defense William
Perry said today that closer military ties between the U.S. and
Croatia depend on Zagreb's efforts in fully implementing the
Dayton Bosnian peace accords.
</P>
<P>
After talks with Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, Perry said
they also discussed means of strengthening bilateral relations
such as exchanges of military personnel and joint military
exercises.
</P>
<P>
"Assuming a full compliance with the Dayton agreement, we will
establish full-ranged security relationship," Perry said, adding
that he will then personally sponsor Croatia's membership for
NATO's peace partnership.
</P>
<P>
Tudjman said that Croatia would do everything to see the Dayton
accords implemented consistently and steps have been proposed to
strengthen the Muslim-Croat federation.
</P>
<P>
Perry arrived here today on a two-day tour which will also take
him to Tuzla, Bosnia, amid signs that the warring sides have
failed to implement the peace agreement, especially regarding the
federation and the freedom of movement.
</P>
<P>
On his flight here, Perry told reporters that NATO forces will
begin a vigorous crackdown on illegal checkpoints on Bosnia, which
have been set up to extort money and curb freedom of movement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Croatian Defense Minister Gojko Susak announced
today that one of the Croats indicted by the U.N. tribunal in the
Hague will go to the Netherlands to face trial Monday.
</P>
<P>
General Tihomir Blaskic, a former commander of the Croat
militia forces, was indicted for alleged massacres of Muslim
civilians during Bosnia's Croat-Muslim war in 1993-94.
</P>
<P>
After talks with Perry, Tudjman said that further handovers of
alleged Croat war criminals would hinge on action by Bosnia's
Muslim-led government and Serbia to extradite their ethnic kinsmen
already indicted by the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Washington has been pressuring Croatia and other signatories to
cooperate with the Hague tribunal to implement the peace terms as
specified by the Dayton accords on Bosnia.

according to the Omani News Agency ONA.
</P>
<P>
Peres is the second Israeli Government head to visit the

The trip makes Peres the first Israeli Premier to visit Qatar,
another Gulf Arab country.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Oman and Qatar announced the establishment of

<P>
SAN JOSE, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Economic policies in Latin
America over the last 15 years will come under the spotlight when
the Economic Commission for Latin America (Cepal) holds its
biennial meeting on April 15.
</P>
<P>
Governments from the region will discuss measures to achieve
economic stability, growth and social equality and evaluate
economic policies adopted after the 1980s' debt crisis.
</P>
<P>
The five-day meeting in Costa Rica will review Cepal's
performance over the last two years and approve a plan for the
next two years.
</P>
<P>
Ministers will also analyze two reports entitled "To Strengthen
the Development of Interactions in Macro- and Micro-Economy" and
"Fifteen Years of Economic Activity in Latin America and the
Caribbean, 1995."
</P>
<P>
Cepal says Latin America's economic growth over the
last 15 years has been "respectable" but "not very satisfactory."
</P>
<P>
Cepal's statistics show that the region's gross domestic
product increased 4 percent in 1995. The average growth in Central
America and the Caribbean was 3.4 percent, and 2.9 percent in
South American countries.
</P>
<P>
The organization says the region's economic development in the
1990s has been characterized by lower public sector deficits,
higher levels of employment and a recovery in investment.

<HEADLINE> Court Rejects EU's Signing of Human Rights Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Court has ruled
that the European Union (EU) can't sign the International Covenant
on Human Rights as it has no jurisdiction in human rights affairs.
</P>
<P>
A communique published today said the court ruled on Thursday
that there was no legal basis for the EU to sign the human rights
documents, because there are no provisions in the EU's treaty
allowing it to implement human rights resolutions or to sign any
human rights conventions.
</P>
<P>
The European Council passed a bill in April 1994, proposing
the EU sign the International Convention on Guaranteeing Human
Rights and Fundamental Freedom in order to play a bigger role in
human rights affairs.
</P>
<P>
But under EU regulations, such a bill could only be
adopted after the ruling of the European Court.
</P>
<P>
The EU will have to revise its treaty in order to sign the
human rights conventions, said the communique.

WASHINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron
Brown will lead a trade mission to Bosnia and Croatia to promote
the peace process and economic reconstruction in the Balkans, the
Commerce Department announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Brown, who leaves here Saturday for the Balkans trip, will
be the second U.S. cabinet official to visit the war-torn region
in a week. U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry has planned to
stop in the Balkans to press Bosnia and Croatia to shore up their
fragile federation during his on-going six-day European and Middle
Eastern tour.
</P>
<P>
Brown told reporters that his delegation consists of a dozen
American corporate executives from large and medium size firms.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will go to the Bosnian and Croatian capitals of
Sarajevo and Zagreb as well as the major northern Bosnian city of
Tuzla to meet with local officials for discussions on
reconstruction programs.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the mission demonstrates our commitment to
long-term stability in Bosnia and Croatia is rock solid," Brown
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the trip may not include the usual contract
signing that normally mark his foreign trade missions. But he
could not rule out such a possibility.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that a number of American corporations are eager
to develop commercial and trade relations with the Balkan nations.
</P>
<P>
Brown noted that senior officials from the Boeing Co. are going
with him, and expressed hope that Croatian civil aviation
authorities will buy Boeing planes instead of European ones.

WASHINGTON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A small plane attempting an
emergency landing crashed onto a highway in eastern U.S. today,
killing four people, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The four-seat Piper aircraft was trying to make an emergency
landing in a cranberry bog when it slammed into a station wagon
traveling on a nearby interstate highway in Wareham, Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
Police said the plane's only engine had failed before it
crashed onto the highway, killing two men aboard and a mother and
her four-year-old daughter traveling in a car.
</P>
<P>
But the driver of the car, identified as Tony Lobello, 31,
survived the crash and was taken to hospital. His condition was
not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the plane burst into flames and the blaze gutted
both the plane and the car.
</P>
<P>
Police said the pilot radioed the New Redford Municipal Airport
that he had lost power in his engine and was going to attempt an
emergency landing.
</P>
<P>
The plane hit some trees along the highway's northbound lane,
crossed the median and hit the mid-sized station wagon traveling
southbound, said State Trooper Douglas Mendes.

<HEADLINE> India to Ban on Azo Dyes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- India will introduce a blanket
ban on the use of azo dyes for textiles, carpets, leather goods
and toys to secure export.
</P>
<P>
With Germany, India's major European market for textiles and
leather goods, imposing a ban on imports using azo dyes and five
other European countries along with Japan poised to follow suit,
India stands to lose out on exports unless producers use azo-free
dyes, an official said here today.
</P>
<P>
A notification is expected to follow, close on the heels of the
German ban becoming a law on April 11 this year.
</P>
<P>
Azo-based dyes, traditionally the most commonly used among
chemical dyes, have been found by international health experts to
be carcinogenic.
</P>
<P>
Already 80 of the benzidine group of dyes have been banned. The
Indian ban will mean extending the list of banned dyes to include
32 azo-based dyes.
</P>
<P>
"With textiles accounting for 38 percent of the Indian exports
and the azo dyes ban spreading across our major markets, we have
to take it into account while formulating the national textile
policy," Indian Textile Secretary T.S. R. Subramaniam said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Sonia Gandhi, widow of the late
prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, is believed to be considering
contesting the general elections to be started from April 27 this
year, it is learnt here today.
</P>
<P>
Congress party leaders who met her in the last 24 hours said
that she was not disinclined. She was weighing the pros and cons
of standing as an independent or on a Congress ticket.
</P>
<P>
The central election committee of the Congress, which
considered the seats for Uttar Pradesh on Friday evening and
cleared most sitting members, left the nomination for Amethi open.
Sources said that the Congress high command would have to give
Sonia Gandhi Amethi, the constituency of her husband Rajiv Gandhi,
if she decided to contest.
</P>
<P>
Sonia refused to succeed her husband as the Congress president
when the latter was assassinated in 1991 election campaigns. Since
then, she has kept away from active politics.
</P>
<P>
Sonia Gandhi must realize that unless she acts now, her hold on
the Congress party will slacken. She had a major say in ticket
distribution in the last elections but has not been consulted even
about Amethi this time, some politicians here said.
</P>
<P>
The entry of Sonia Gandhi would lend new focus to this year's
elections. The Congress dissidents would rally round her and the
opposition would make her the target of its attack, political
circles here said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: PM's Resignation Paves Way for Solution to Bangladesh's Political Crisis (By Jiang Xianming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshis have heaved a sigh of
relief and begun to see a ray of hope in the solution to the
country's prolonged political crisis, as a neutral caretaker
government is being set up, paving the way for fresh "fair"
elections as demanded by the opposition.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday afternoon, Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia
resigned simultaneously with the parliament's dissolution by
President Abdur Rahman Biswas.
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, retired Chief Justice Habibur Rahman was
sworn in as Chief Adviser of the proposed non-party caretaker
government after both the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and
the opposition alliance of the Awami (People's) League (AL), the
Jatiya (National) Party (JP) and the Jamaat-E-Islami accepted the
designation by President Biswas.
</P>
<P>
"My immediate job is to maintain law and order in the country
and establish an atmosphere conducive to free and fair elections,"
the chief adviser said, adding that the people now want peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
During the past two years, the then ruling BNP and the
opposition Al-JP-Jamaat alliance have been locked in political
confrontation over the issue of the caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
To realize their demand for the caretaker government under
which "free and fair" elections could be held, the mainstream
opposition parties have launched one strike or strike-like
agitation program after another, causing severe damage to the
national economy and bringing the country's normal life to a
virtual standstill.
</P>
<P>
Despite the opposition's resistance and boycott, the February
15 parliamentary elections went ahead and the BNP won a landslide
victory. A new parliament, almost made up entirely of BNP MPs,
and a new cabinet were formed afterwards.
</P>
<P>
That fueled anger of the opposition agitators who then
intensified their campaign against the BNP government through an
indefinite "non-cooperation" program launched on March 9 to press
their demand for the resignation of Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and
fresh polls under a neutral caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
The whole of the country, particularly the capital Dhaka and
the largest port city of Chittagong had almost been shut down by
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
What is seen as the final straw was that the "non-cooperation"
campaign was later joined even by top civil servants, government
secretaries, and many other office workers and employees of
government ministries, virtually paralyzing the administrative
system of the government and dealing a heavy blow the BNP
government.
</P>
<P>
Facing growing political and economic pressure, the BNP's
policy-makers have realized that they would make a big mistake if
they continued to hold on to power. It would be in the best
interests of the BNP to keep its popularity among the people with
an eye on the next general elections.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the BNP government has taken steps to speed up the
process of forming the caretaker government to pave the way for
ending the country's political impasse.
</P>
<P>
The BNP first passed a constitution amendment bill in
parliament on Tuesday, allowing the formation of the caretaker
government. Khaleda then met with the president twice in 48 hours,
asking him to assent to the bill and form the caretaker government
within the shortest possible time.
</P>
<P>
The president immediately consulted with retired Chief Justice
Habibur Rahan and different political parties on his designation
of the chief adviser of the caretaker administration.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the opposition has piled up pressures from the
public, especially from the business and trade community on the
government.
</P>
<P>
The major victim was the garment sector. Exportable garment
products worth tk four billion (100 million U.S. dollars) have
been dumped or tucked into stock lot in the past few months, as
the exporters could not make shipments on schedule.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as many as 500 garment factories have closed down,
with more than 200,000 employees laid off.
</P>
<P>
Chittagong, the largest port in the country, had been shut down
since the "non-cooperation" campaign began on March 9.
</P>
<P>
The opposition's program, on the other hand, also caused panic,
as tension and fear were gripping the country. Bomb blasts, gun
battles and violent and bloody clashes between rival political
parties have been a common occurrence in cities and towns across
the country.
</P>
<P>
To get rid of the backlash, the opposition has in fact relaxed
somewhat their original position which has put the cancellation of
the February 15 polls as a pre-condition to dialogue with the BNP
on the formation of the caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
Hailing "the much desired victory of the people" after the
resignation of the BNP government, AL chief Shiekh Hasina said
there were still many questions regarding the legal status of the
non-party caretaker government. "But we think that the prime need
of the hour is to bring back normalcy in all spheres of national
life and revitalize the economic activities," she said.
</P>
<P>
The AL and other opposition parties last night announced
withdrawal of their "non-operation movement" in view of the latest
development, calling on all office workers and employees to
perform "their respective duties right at the moment."
</P>
<P>
The country's political parties and professional groups last
night hailed the appointment of the chief adviser and the process

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- A group of 38 English teachers
graduated from a special English training course Saturday, which
aimed at improving their oral English and listening comprehension.
</P>
<P>
The UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO) sponsored the program, together with the Beijing
Municipal UNESCO Clubs Association.
</P>
<P>
English teachers from local vocational schools, since January,
were given ten-week training in the Chaoyang District Vocational
and Educational Center, to practise their spoken-English and
listening comprehension.
</P>
<P>
Shikon Takei, a UNESCO representative to China, said: "It is
important to improve Chinese teachers' oral English. We carried
out the program to provide more opportunities for them to practise
more."
</P>
<P>
He added that they hope to continue such training programs in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Foreign experts from Britain, the United States and Australia,
with at least two years of teaching experience in China, undertook
the teaching in their spare time and without any pay.
</P>
<P>
"I came to teach here not for financial reason, but for the
love of Chinese culture," said Hilary Wheadon from England, adding
that "I hope to contribute to the cultural exchanges between China
and western countries."
</P>
<P>
A young man named Wang Linghai said that he was too shy to
speak English at first. After training, "my oral English and
listening comprehension have improved." He expressed the desire to
continue the study.
</P>
<P>
Guo Shanquan, a 50-year-old woman teacher with a local
vocational school, said the training course has helped them get to
know more about the western culture and customs.

<HEADLINE> Telephone as Dowry for a Daughter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- It is a prevalent Chinese
tradition that parents should give their daughter a dowry at her
wedding ceremony. But bride Shen A'huan found that her father's
gift was a telephone.
</P>
<P>
The father, Shen Yuehui, developed his fondness for telephones

they had no telephone service still linger as a nightmare in his
mind, giving him the idea of a telephone as a dowry for his
daughter.
</P>
<P>
With the annual per capita income reaching 6,000 yuan, Dongshan
is now the richest village in the county. More and more young
couples are applying for telephones to be installed.
</P>
<P>
Aware of the new dowry fad in Gongqian, the local posts and
telecommunications bureau permitted Shen A'huan the privilege of
choosing an auspicious telephone number.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Implement Guarantee Account for Processing Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Customs will implement
guarantee account for export-oriented processing enterprises to
import raw materials and articles, starting April 1, according to
a State Council decision.
</P>
<P>
The system has already been carried out in Ningbo City in East
China's Zhejiang Province, Suzhou City in Jiangsu Province, and in
Dongguan City in south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Guarantee account means that processing-trade enterprises and
units, including foreign trade companies, industrial-trade firms,
state enterprises, overseas-funded enterprises and firms which are
given approval to process imported materials have to register with
designated banks for importing raw materials and articles with the
approval of the local customs bureau.
</P>
<P>
According to regulations, all processed products must be
exported within fixed processing terms. Banks will cancel the
guarantee account after the verification by the customs.
</P>
<P>
Implementation of the guarantee account is helpful for
strengthening macro supervision of processing trade and stopping
illegal activities, such as smuggling, in the name of processing
trade, thus guaranteeing the state tariff revenue.

<HEADLINE> Wuhan Eyes More Green Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, March 31 (Xinhua) -- This capital of central China's
Hubei Province is determined to have more green land to cool down
its unbearably hot summer.
</P>
<P>
The city's Bureau of Parks and Trees has decided that it will
build 262,000 sq m of new public green land this year, doubling
the original goal.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan is one of the hottest Chinese cities in the summer. The
city now has 31 percent of its area covered in greenery, but the
distribution is very uneven. In the downtown area of Hankou the
coverage of trees is only 10 percent while the density of the
buildings is as high as 70 percent, causing a serious "heat
island" effect.
</P>
<P>
According to officials of the bureau, 160,000 sq m of
the new green areas will be in the city proper, including two
parks with a total area of 150,000 sq m.
</P>
<P>
The city is also determined to allow more space for trees and
lawns in new construction projects and take a tough stand toward
damage to public green land.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the bureau said that the surface temperature of a
piece of green land could be 10 degrees Celsius lower than that of
a piece of paved land, and that the irrigation effect of water
evaporated by 1,000 broad-leaf trees is equal to that of spraying
50 tons of water in the same area.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 31 (Xinhua) -- People are making provision for
their old age after a new insurance scheme for retirement pensions
was introduced in southeast China's coastal Province of Fujian.
</P>
<P>
The scheme also includes self-employed workers and employees
with overseas-funded companies.
</P>
<P>
The Provincial Labor Department said the new old-age insurance
system has combined mutual assistance funds with personal savings,
which means a change for the country's old-age insurance mode.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, the pension will be covered by the state,
enterprises and individuals jointly, and will be linked to the
average salary of workers, the time for and amount of the payment
for the insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
Employees of all enterprises, and self-employed workers in the
townships and cities of the province, are all covered by the
insurance system, which came into operation at the beginning of
the year.
</P>
<P>
Chinese workers in overseas-funded enterprises, and overseas
enterprises' agencies in the province, also come within the new
insurance system.
</P>
<P>
The new insurance system was mapped out after comprehensive
consultation with many enterprises and economists, and experiments
involving more than 46,000 employees in 100 enterprises.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Post-doctorate centers in
Zhejiang Province, east China, have become gathering places for
outstanding high-level researchers, educational sources said.
</P>
<P>
The post-doctorate system was established in 1985 in three of
the province's noted universities, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou
University and Zhejiang Agricultural University.
</P>
<P>
So far 13 centers have been set up in the province, which have
recruited 179 post-doctors over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
The centers are mainly engaged in research work on instruments
and meters, automatic controls, electricity, mathematics, physics,
chemistry and agricultural sciences.
</P>
<P>
Having stepped out of the centers, many post-doctorate students
have gone on to do outstanding work in theoretical and practical
studies of hi-tech subjects.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang University is the province's first to launch training
programs for post-doctorate students. Statistics on 81 of the
students who have left the centers show that they had been
involved in 221 research projects during the stay at the centers,
with 115 completed, and 48 projects reaching an advanced
international level.
</P>
<P>
The students also had 518 academic papers published at home and
abroad during their study periods.
</P>
<P>
Officials in charge of the centers attributed the success to
the high quality of students, and advanced management.
</P>
<P>
The students excelled because they held a profound knowledge
about their own research fields, and importantly, they have
mastered lastest the knowledge in the forefront of science. In
addition, they are devoted to science research, and have
pioneering spirits.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, local authorities have created a favorable
environment to ensure funding for their research, and support for

SHANGHAI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- One-tenth of the people in
Shanghai, China's biggest metropolis, are working voluntarily for
the Red Cross Society, which holds "humanitarian, universal love
and devotion" as its creed.
</P>
<P>
The one million members of the Shanghai-based Red Cross
Society, two times the 1990 figure, have been working efficiently
for people across the country in emergency aid, first aid and
social services.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the organization has transported through
Shanghai some 289 million yuan (about 32 million US dollars) of
emergency aid from the Red Cross Societies in Hong Kong, Taiwan
regions and some foreign countries to 29 provinces, cities and
autonomous regions in China, and 190 tons of emergency aid to 12
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The organization has set up 26 Red Cross service stations for
old people, who make up 17 percent of the city's population. it

<HEADLINE> Recovery in Brazilian Coffee Harvest Could Hit Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A recovery in Brazil's
coffee harvest this year could hit international coffee prices.
</P>
<P>
Coffee prices on the international market have already been
falling this year and a 15 per cent rise in production from
Brazil, the world's biggest coffee grower, could create further
problems, a report by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and
Statistics says.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's coffee harvest has been devastated by cold weather
over the last two years. In 1995, it's estimated some 40 percent
of the harvest was lost because of frost.
</P>
<P>
But the institute expects a recovery this year, with the
harvest rising to just over 1.7 million tons, 227,000 tons more
than in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The IBGE said coffee output in the state of Sao Paulo, a major
coffee producing area, will increase by about a half
over last year.
</P>
<P>
The report says the rise will create new problems for the
Coffee Producer Countries Association, which tries to regulate the
industry and set prices.

<HEADLINE> China Plans to Charge Students for College Education in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- An end is in sight to
double-standards in China's higher education, with the
introduction of a pay-to-learn scheme for all students, according
to the State Education Commission (SEC).
</P>
<P>
A new SEC decision has encouraged colleges and universities to
charge their students tuition fees.
</P>
<P>
The SEC decision gives priority to enrolling freshmen to
colleges and universities which take on students with a unified
standard, and charge them for receiving college education.
</P>
<P>
College education has previously been paid for by the
government, which naturally assigned jobs to college
graduates. In 1994, China decided to charge students part of their
college education costs. College students in turn would get
greater say in choosing jobs.
</P>
<P>
Those colleges and universities which continue to enroll
students with different standards - they usually require less
scores if the students were economically sponsored by work units
or by themselves - will have to enroll freshmen, after their
counterparts have completed their intake programs.
</P>
<P>
An SEC official said that the pro-charged college education
reform, which called for the elimination of double standards in
enrolling college students, reflects the principle of equality in
education, and the basic principle of college student enrollment.
</P>
<P>
Some 257 colleges and universities across China have been
involved in the reform in 1995. According to an SEC plan, over
half of China's 1,054 colleges and universities will charge
freshmen tuition fees beginning this fall semester.
</P>
<P>
Students in normal, agricultural, forestry, nautical, ethnic
minority and physical culture colleges and universities will not
be charged tuition fees, even if those colleges and universities
carry out the reform.
</P>
<P>
Colleges and universities of hydraulic engineering, geological
mining, police, meteorology and topography were asked to charge
their students no, or lower tuition fees.

<HEADLINE> Greek Defense Minister Warns Danger in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Minister Gerassimos
Arsenis today warned of the danger of a "second round to the
Bosnian crisis" which would have repercussions on the greater
region of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar on the Dayton peace agreement, the
minister held that the lack of progress in the implementation of
the political part of the agreement posed great danger to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Arsenis also expressed fears that the forthcoming elections in
Bosnia might produce primarily national parties which could
threaten the political cohesion of the federation, with political
leaders increasingly looking to Belgrade and Zagreb.
</P>
<P>
This, Asenis said, might in turn cause the break-up of the
Bosnian federation when the peacekeeping force withdraws.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the economic reconstruction of the
region had not yet begun, despite many promises of funds, "and
without economic development, the political problems becomes
greater and the prospect for political cohesion becomes more
remote."
</P>
<P>
"We must re-examine the political part of the Dayton agreement
and see what economic and political infrastructure should now be
built in order to avoid a second round of the Bosnian crisis,"
Arsenis said.
</P>
<P>
He underlined however that the military aspect of the Dayton
agreement had succeeded beyond all expectations.
</P>
<P>
"We must see this success not only with respect to the great
importance it has for the settlement of the Bosnian problem, but
as the precursor of a model for a multinational peacekeeping force
in the future, for other missions and in other parts of the
world,'' Arsenis claimed.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Capital Decries Menace Of Street Begging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's federal capital territory
(FCT) has set up an inter-ministerial forum in response to the
menace posed by street beggars and destitutes in Abuja.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of State for the FCT, Mrs. Marian Ikejiani-
clark, was quoted today by the News Agency of Nigeria as saying in
Abuja that the presence of beggars and destitutes in the city had
given Abuja a negative image as a new federal capital city.
</P>
<P>
The forum was constituted to evolve a lasting solution to the
growing menace of street begging and destitution, and charge the
residents of Abuja to advise the forum on measures aimed at
checking the social menace.
</P>
<P>
According to the Minister, measures taken by the government in
the past to rid it of beggars had failed.
</P>
<P>
The FCT administration recently evacuated thousands of
destitutes and beggars who had moved to Abuja after Lagos and
Kano states took stringent measures against street begging.

next year", added the ANC.
