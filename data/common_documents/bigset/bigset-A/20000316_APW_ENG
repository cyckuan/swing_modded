<HEADLINE> L.A. Jury Deadlocked Over Shootout  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA DEUTSCH, AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The jury in the North Hollywood shootout
trial sent word Wednesday that the panel was hopelessly deadlocked
over the claim that police let a wounded gunman die.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge ordered the panel, which has deliberated for three
full days, to try again to reach a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have an obligation to reach a verdict if you can do so
without violating your own conscience,'' said U.S. District Judge
Christina Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors deliberated a few more hours and recessed for the
night. Earlier Wednesday, they had sent a note to Snyder that said:
''We all agree that additional deliberation time will be of no
use.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit against retired policemen John Futrell and James
Vojtecky and the city claims the officers let Emil Matasareanu, 30,
die due to deliberate indifference.
</P>
<P>
   Matasareanu's children are seeking unspecified damages in the
civil rights lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The allegation cast a shadow over what had been heralded as a
day of heroism as lightly armed officers took on gunmen who blasted
a neighborhood around a Bank of America branch with automatic
weapons, wounding 11 officers and six civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The jury heard conflicting medical opinions on whether
Matasareanu could have survived. But based on testimony the jury
asked to have read back, the panel appeared to focus on whether
emergency medical help was or could have been available.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony involved an ambulance crew that arrived but left
without Matasareanu after Vojtecky allegedly told the crew to ''get
the (expletive) out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Vojtecky testified he did not say that but did
say something similar.
</P>
<P>
   The officers testified they tried to get the ambulance to come
back or to get another one, but the plaintiffs focused on a point
at which Futrell canceled an ambulance call and told the
dispatcher, ''I have no officers or citizens down, only a
suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Futrell insisted the seriousness of Matasareanu's wounds were
not apparent.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs' lawyers told the jury that Matasareanu had done
a ''bad thing'' -- robbing a bank and shooting a lot of people -- but
had suffered a tortured death.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing full body armor, Matasareanu and Larry Eugene Phillips,
26, were spotted by a police unit as they tried get away from the
bank on Feb. 28, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The hooded gunmen raked the area with hundreds of rounds of
gunfire in a 44-minute battle as the nation watched on television.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips died first, shooting himself as a police bullet hit his
spine. Matasareanu drove off but was forced to take cover behind
his car in a street.
</P>
<P>
   He finally fell after a furious firefight with SWAT officers.
Shot 29 times, he bled profusely as he lay handcuffed.
</P>
<P>
   The defense argued that the scene was chaotic, many people
needed rescue, that officers did request aid for Matasareanu but
the area was too dangerous for ambulance crews as police searched
for other gunmen.

<HEADLINE> Couple Wins $26M in Bronco Case  </HEADLINE>
By MARY ANN LICKTEIG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A jury has ordered Ford Motor Co. to pay
nearly $26 million to a man whose Bronco truck rolled over on a
freeway in 1996, leaving him quadriplegic.
</P>
<P>
   An Alameda Superior Court jury on Tuesday determined Richard
Raimondi and his wife, Dana, had suffered $52 million in damages.
But they awarded them half that amount after finding Mr. Raimondi
shared responsibility with Ford for the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Ford said the company would ask a judge to set
aside or reduce the verdict, and would appeal if their efforts
fail.
</P>
<P>
   Raimondi was alone in his Bronco II-model truck in July 1996
when he swerved to miss debris on Interstate 880 in Fremont, a
suburb about 30 miles southeast of San Francisco. The truck scraped
a concrete median, bounced back, clipped a car and rolled over
three times.
</P>
<P>
   During a two-month trial, the couple's lawyers argued the
truck's narrow wheelbase and high center of gravity made it
unstable and prone to roll over.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their argument is these things should all be like passenger
cars,'' said Warren Platt, an attorney for Ford. ''From the
standpoint of the manufacturers, there's no way that can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford made 700,000 Bronco IIs between 1983 and 1990. As of
January 1999, Ford had settled 679 Bronco II rollover cases,
according to the Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   About 16 lawsuits have gone to trial, Platt said. Of those, Ford
has won about 70 percent, he said.

<HEADLINE> Senators 3, Flames 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- It looks like Patrick Lalime isn't ready
to hand over Ottawa's No. 1 goaltending job to Tom Barrasso.
</P>
<P>
   With the newly acquired Barrasso looking on from the press box,
Lalime made 36 saves, barely missing his second straight shutout in
leading the Senators to a 3-1 victory Wednesday night over the
fading Calgary Flames.
</P>
<P>
   Lalime improved to 17-11-3 this season and is unbeaten in his
last five starts (4-0-1), during which he has a 1.18 goals-against
average.
</P>
<P>
   Barrasso was acquired by the Senators on Tuesday from Pittsburgh
for goaltender Ron Tugnutt and defenseman Janne Laukkanen. The
34-year-old just recently resumed skating after spending three
weeks with his family following the death of his father.
</P>
<P>
   Lalime lost his shutout with 16 seconds left when rookie Jeff
Cowan tipped in a slap shot by Derek Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn McEachern, Radek Bonk and Daniel Alfredsson scored for
Ottawa, which moved past idle Florida and into fifth spot in the
Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   In running their road unbeaten streak to five games (3-0-2), the
Senators also moved within five points of Northeast
Division-leading Toronto, which lost to Chicago. Ottawa is 6-1-2 in
its last nine games.
</P>
<P>
   The Flames lost their fifth in a row.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tough debut for Flames defenseman Brad Werenka,
acquired from Pittsburgh on Tuesday. He was caught out of position
on Ottawa's second goal, with 4:14 left in the second period. Bonk
slipped behind Werenka and was alone in front to bang Marian
Hossa's centering pass behind goaltender Fred Brathwaite.
</P>
<P>
   Flames rookie defenseman Robyn Regehr was the victim on
Alfredsson's goal 1:59 into the third period that put Ottawa ahead
3-0. The Ottawa captain picked off Regehr's clearing attempt along
the boards. When Regehr came at him, Alfredsson stepped around him
and had a clear break for a wrist shot that beat Brathwaite.
</P>
<P>
   McEachern gave Ottawa the lead 4:18 into the game. Joe Juneau
worked the puck to Andreas Dackell, whose centering pass to an
uncovered McEachern was one-timed past Brathwaite.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani seeks soft money; Clinton links mayor to David Duke  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- In what is shaping up as one of the roughest
Senate campaigns in the nation, Hillary Rodham Clinton has sent out
fund-raising letters linking a Rudolph Giuliani-hired, direct-mail
specialist to former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the New York City mayor has hired Richard Viguerie
to raise money from conservatives across the country, Clinton
campaign manager Bill de Blasio wrote that ''Viguerie has raised
money for Oliver North, Jesse Helms, Pat Buchanan, the NRA and the
Reverend Sung Myung Moon's Unification Church. He's even said that
David Duke has 'a very good, sound message.'''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, de Blasio denied his letter was an
attempt to inject racism into the campaign by using Duke's name.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think it's important that people understand the kind of
campaign Giuliani is running and the kind of people he chose to
ally himself with ... We are explaining to people and reminding
people who Richard Viguerie is,'' de Blasio said. ''We are not
trying to do anything more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the mention of Duke dovetails with the Clinton
campaign's desire to energize the state's black vote against
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about de Blasio's letter, Giuliani campaign manager Bruce
Teitelbaum said ''the only Senate candidate with ties to racial
extremists with a history of inflaming racial tensions is Hillary
Clinton, given her embrace of Al Sharpton.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has visited with Sharpton at his Harlem center.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Democrats said Wednesday that Giuliani's decision to
begin collecting unlimited soft-money donations for his Senate race
against Clinton has ''the stench of hypocrisy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's earlier decision to set up soft-money accounts for the
Senate race had been roundly criticized by Giuliani, including as
recently as last week in a letter from the mayor to potential
donors.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Roy, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial
Committee that helped set up the Giuliani account, said Wednesday
it was done to remain competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to fight fire with fire,'' Roy said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to go into this race with one hand tied behind
our back,'' Teitelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Roy said the Giuliani Victory Committee, which can legally
accept unlimited donations from individuals and corporations, has
been set up in conjunction with Giuliani's own Senate campaign
committee.
</P>
<P>
   One GOP operative, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a
similar Giuliani soft-money committee was being created in
cooperation with the state GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters are being asked to contribute up to $50,000 a couple
to attend the Giuliani Victory Committee's inaugural dinner on
March 23 in New York City, an event expected to raise up to $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   Political soft money, and abuses tied to it, became a major
issue in the wake of the 1996 presidential race in which President
Clinton made heavy use of it in his victory over Bob Dole. Such
money can be used to attack or boost one candidate or another, as
long it does not directly advocate voting for a particular
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum said the move was prompted by ''the enormous amounts
of unethical fund-raising the Justice Department has allowed the
Clintons to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Giuliani sent out a fund-raising letter for his
regular campaign committee complaining that ''the Clintons were
skirting the law by raising millions of dollars in unregulated
'soft money' to help finance Hillary's campaign against me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which set up a
soft-money operation for the first lady last year, issued a
statement saying that given the mayor's earlier criticism of
Clinton, his move has ''the stench of hypocrisy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the rankest, most fundamental personal dishonesty,''
the DSCC statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's soft money accounts had collected more than $700,000
as of the end of last year and such money is expected to become
crucial closer to Election Day as the two camps pour money into
television advertisements and seek large sums quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Through their regular campaign committees, Clinton and Giuliani
raised almost $20 million last year, with him leading the way at
$11.5 million, in what is expected to become the most expensive
Senate race ever. Individual contributions to those committees are
limited to $2,000 and corporations can't give to them.

<HEADLINE> Legislative majorities approve spending resolutions  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The ruling blocs in both the state Assembly
and Senate have staked out their positions on how much to spend in
New York state's new fiscal year and what to spend it on.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the arduous task -- if the last 15 years of timely
budget failures in New York are any indication -- of reconciling
lawmakers' budget proposals, keeping in mind that Gov. George
Pataki has ultimate veto power over what they come up with.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats who dominate the Assembly passed a resolution
Wednesday they said would cost $78.2 billion, or about $1.3 billion
more than Pataki's spending plan. The Republican-led Senate said
the budget resolution it approved Wednesday totals about $500
million more than the Republican governor's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Though an $800 million difference between the Assembly and
Senate sounds huge, the two sides were perhaps $3 billion or more
apart in negotiations over the current state budget at this time
last year. Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said Wednesday the
Assembly spending levels are in the ''ballpark'' with the other
proposals this time around.
</P>
<P>
   But Silver also began the rhetorical sparring that typically
accompanies the approach of negotiations over a new budget. The
state's 2000-01 fiscal year begins on April 1 and the state has not
had a new budget in place on time since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Silver questioned how Senate Republicans could propose a series
of ambitious tax cuts and spending plans, and then only figure that
their resolution would cost a half a billion dollars more than
Pataki's.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're spending so much and so much and so much, but they're
only spending $400 million more (than Pataki),'' Silver said. ''Or
is it $600 million more?''
</P>
<P>
   The speaker said the Senate's resolution was ''smoke and
mirrors.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno had suggested
that Silver was the one who favors excessive spending as another
legislative election approaches this November. Bruno also
criticized Silver for not proposing deep-enough tax cuts to spur
business.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bruno and Silver have said they want the differences
between the two chambers to be resolved in public conference
committees. It was unclear Wednesday when the first conference
committee would meet to resolve the first important question facing
the lawmakers -- how much money will be available to spend in the
2000-01 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   On some matters, the Senate Republican and Assembly Democratic
resolutions are on the same page, or close to it.
</P>
<P>
   Each chamber has rejected Pataki's proposal to create a
superagency encompassing some 40,000 employees currently in the
State Police, state Department of Correctional Services and other
law enforcement-related state agencies. Silver said the Assembly
did not ''see much'' in the way of cost-savings or bureaucratic
streamlining through the consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   Each chamber also rejected a proposed increase in hunting and
fishing licenses and said the state should pay for the county
taxpayers' share -- to grow to $340 million -- of the new Family
Health Plus medical insurance program which goes into effect in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly and Senate put forward proposals on some programs
that are similar enough to suggest the two houses could fairly
easily work out differences.
</P>
<P>
   Both chambers' majorities, for instance, proposed expanding the
state's Elderly Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage program,
simplifying the rules and expanding the income eligibility
standards. Both favor raising the Earned Income Tax Credit, Tuition
Assistance Program awards and increasing revenue sharing and other
aid programs for localities.
</P>
<P>
   But the two chambers are further apart on cutting the state's
gasoline tax -- Silver wants a two-month suspension of the tax to
give motoring tourists a break this summer while Bruno wants to
rescind it permanently -- and the Senate also favors eliminating the
state's gross receipt tax on energy while the Assembly wants only
limited reductions.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly plan does not provide for a hallmark of the
Senate's budget -- a proposed $2.5 billion road- and bridge-building
bond act -- while the Senate plan funds less than half the
Assembly's centerpiece ''LADDER'' program to pay for
pre-kindergarten programs and to reduce early grade class sizes.

<HEADLINE> McCall tells supporters he is running for governor  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Democrats who were on hand for the private
meeting say state Comptroller H. Carl McCall told supporters this
week that he is running for governor in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   McCall, the first and thus far only black ever elected to
statewide office in New York, didn't deny making such a statement
at the Tuesday night meeting in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   ''I made a long speech. I said a lot of things. But my position,
my public position, is I will make an announcement about what I'm
going to do in November, after the election'' this year, the New
York City Democrat said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you want to say people said that I said something, that's
fine,'' McCall added.
</P>
<P>
   McCall also observed to a reporter, ''You've got something to
write.''
</P>
<P>
   For months, McCall has been edging closer to a run for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, he hired a veteran fund-raising operative and in
January said that ''if we can put things in place over the next
several months, then that will decide it. It all seems to be lining
up that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Gov. George Pataki has said he may be interested in
running for a third term.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, federal Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo,
son of former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, is also considering the
2002 governor's race. Pataki beat the elder Cuomo as he tried for a
fourth, four-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Cuomo, who has been pressing New York Democrats not to
line up behind McCall, said through a spokesman that ''right now my
political focus is to help Al Gore become president and Hillary
Clinton become senator. Any discussion of future election campaigns
would be a distraction for the Democratic effort.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall said he told Democrats at Tuesday's meeting that their
first priority this year had to be electing Gore and the first
lady.
</P>
<P>
   At least four Democrats who attended the Tuesday night session
with McCall at an Albany hotel -- all speaking on condition of
anonymity -- said the comptroller said he was running. The session
was the first of five regional meetings being held by McCall's
gubernatorial advisory committee over the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, 'I'm not exploring it, I'm running,''' one Democrat
quoted McCall as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Another Democrat said McCall had said, ''I'm not exploring, I'm
not determining, I'm running.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats who attended the meeting and were willing to
speak publicly -- although not about McCall's specific statements --
said they were confident McCall would run.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think everybody came out of that meeting clearly believing
that Carl was running,'' said state Assembly Majority Leader
Michael Bragman, a powerful Syracuse-area Democrat who is backing
McCall.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's just say, it's looking really good,'' said state
Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez, the Bronx County Democratic chairman
who ran the Tuesday night meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was very impressed with his total forthrightness and fervor
in indicating we could come and support him for governor,'' said
state Sen. Neil Breslin of Albany, another meeting attendee. ''He
will be a wonderful governor.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall turned down opportunities to run for governor in 1998 and
for the U.S. Senate this year.
</P>
<P>
   In his second, four-year term as comptroller, McCall has an
impressive resume. An ordained minister, he has served in the state
Senate and as a deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. He
was a Citibank vice president and president of the New York City
Board of Education before becoming comptroller.

<HEADLINE> Out-of-state teachers can work in N.Y. without certification  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Teachers that have been approved to teach by
39 states can now teach in New York for two years before being
forced to pass the state's certification test, the state Board of
Regents has decided.
</P>
<P>
   About 54,000 teachers in New York City alone will retire over
the next five years, officials say. To help replace those teachers,
the state Education Department can grant a two-year provisional
certification to licensed teachers who move to New York from an
approved state or to those who have a national teaching
certificate.
</P>
<P>
   However, the teacher must pass the New York certification exam
within the two years to continue teaching, the Regents decided last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is expected to entice teachers from more states to
think about working in New York, Education Department spokesman
Alan Ray said.
</P>
<P>
   New York already has a similar agreement in place with Rhode
Island, Massachusetts, Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut,
Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia. Thirty-one other states
will be added in under the new rule, said Charles Mackey, executive
coordinator of the Education Department's office of teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ''This program gives credence to the standards adopted for
teachers in those other states,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Only teachers who are licensed by the states that have signed an
interstate agreement that defines some of the qualifications that
are necessary to obtain a teaching license can participate. Also,
teachers who are licensed in any state and have a certificate from
the National Board of Professional Teaching Standards will be
eligible for the New York program.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the certification program, New York will soon
begin giving its certification test in other states to lure
teachers here, Mackey said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, our tests are only administered in New York but in
the future we're expanding to other states like California and
Texas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, uncertified New York teachers have one year to pass
the certification exam, although the state does sometimes allow
teachers in high-need districts like New York City to teach longer
with a temporary certificate. About 10,000 New York City teachers
are unlicensed.
</P>
<P>
   A new state law bans the hiring of unlicensed teachers starting
in 2003, however.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of New York City's teachers' union says the new
measure won't help unless lawmakers raise teacher pay in the city
to match the salaries of suburban teachers. ''It might help open up
the supply a bit, but it's a baby step,'' Randi Weingarten,
president of the United Federation of Teachers, told The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   The states that are not part of the certification agreement are
Alaska, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota,
South Dakota, Wisconsin and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not found the standards in those states to be
compatible with those in New York at this time,'' Mackey said.
</P>
<P>
   The list of states allowed in the program will be reviewed every
five years, he said.

<HEADLINE> Bruno 'disappointed' Pataki didn't give him heads-up  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Senate Republican Leader Joseph Bruno says
his chamber will pass its own gun plan instead of GOP Gov. George
Pataki's nationally touted plan.
</P>
<P>
   This comes after Pataki unveiled his gun-control package without
briefing Bruno beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not angry. Why would I be angry? I mean, he briefed
everybody except me,'' a sarcastic Bruno said at a news conference
surrounded by Republican senators. ''Now, you think that disturbs
me? I appreciate his consideration knowing how busy I was ... and
he knew that I'd hear about it because I watch TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki told ABC in a newscast aired Tuesday night that he would
propose a gun bill including mandatory trigger locks and the taking
of ballistic ''fingerprints'' by manufacturers of all firearms
marketed here.
</P>
<P>
   The package also calls for the minimum age for handgun purchases
in New York to go from 18 to 21, for a ban on assault weapons and
for instant background checks to be made of gun buyers at flea
markets and gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno said Wednesday his Republican majority will pass its own
gun bills next week, which includes a mandatory trigger lock plan
and a ban on assault weapons. ''We haven't seen a bill or a press
release'' from Pataki, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said the ''normal process'' was
followed with the gun proposal: the governor's office contacted the
lawyers in both the Assembly and the Senate Tuesday about the
impending announcement and there were conversations going between
all three camps all day.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're pleased that the Senate Republicans are going to give
serious consideration to Governor Pataki's comprehensive plan to
attack gun violence,'' he said. ''We look forward to getting
bipartisan support from the Legislature and signing that bill into
law this session.''
</P>
<P>
   When pressed about why Bruno wasn't personally called, McKeon
said: ''I'm not going to get bogged down ... that's my answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruno and Pataki are state government's most powerful
Republicans and have been allied for years on tax cuts, anti-crime
bills and other legislation.
</P>
<P>
   But Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat usually at odds
with Pataki, said the governor personally called him Tuesday to
inform him of the impending gun control announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Welcome aboard, Governor,'' Silver said Wednesday. ''Now get
your colleagues in the Senate, your Republican cohorts, to stop
being the poster boys for the NRA.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruno said Pataki talked to him twice Tuesday but never
mentioned his plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would have thought that the governor would have had a
conversation with some of us, with me, and just at least give us a
heads up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since late January, Pataki and Bruno have been fighting over
whether the state should pick up the counties' share of a new
health insurance program, plus other policy issues and perceived or
actual slights.
</P>
<P>
   Most dramatically, those slights included the firing of at least
three Bruno-sponsored state workers in the Pataki administration in
an action widely interpreted by Bruno's members as a show of
gubernatorial displeasure in Senate Republicans. GOP senators also
said the governor contacted them directly to ask about Senate
politics, instead of going through Bruno.
</P>
<P>
   The gun issue becomes especially sensitive for Bruno considering
the rash of highly-publicized shootings around the nation and the
fact that the entire Legislature is up for re-election in November.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's plan has been supported in the past in some form by the
Democrat-dominated state Assembly but the Republican-led Senate,
despite proposals from some of its majority members from New York
City and its suburbs, has not approved any of the anti-gun
measures.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki would not be up for re-election until 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now, what I am is disappointed,'' Bruno said. ''I'm
disappointed in my friend, my colleague, former senator, colleague
and friend to everyone that's here.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruno said he and Pataki had ''partnered ... through thick and
thin -- a lot of thin.''
</P>
<P>
   This also comes during the time of year when Pataki and Bruno
try to reconcile their state budget agendas for the next fiscal
year in hopes of being allied in negotiations against the
Democratic state Assembly, though in current years that has not
always happened.

<HEADLINE> Couple Wins $26M in Ford Case  </HEADLINE>
By MARY ANN LICKTEIG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A jury has ordered Ford Motor Co. to pay
nearly $26 million to a man whose Bronco truck rolled over on a
freeway in 1996, leaving him quadriplegic.
</P>
<P>
   An Alameda Superior Court jury on Tuesday determined Richard
Raimondi and his wife, Dana, had suffered $52 million in damages.
But they awarded them half that amount after finding Mr. Raimondi
shared responsibility with Ford for the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Ford said the company would ask a judge to set
aside or reduce the verdict, and would appeal if their efforts
fail.
</P>
<P>
   Raimondi was alone in his Bronco II-model truck in July 1996
when he swerved to miss debris on Interstate 880 in Fremont, a
suburb about 30 miles southeast of San Francisco. The truck scraped
a concrete median, bounced back, clipped a car and rolled over
three times.
</P>
<P>
   During a two-month trial, the couple's lawyers argued the
truck's narrow wheelbase and high center of gravity made it
unstable and prone to roll over.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their argument is these things should all be like passenger
cars,'' said Warren Platt, an attorney for Ford. ''From the
standpoint of the manufacturers, there's no way that can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford made 700,000 Bronco IIs between 1983 and 1990. As of
January 1999, Ford had settled 679 Bronco II rollover cases,
according to the Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   About 16 lawsuits have gone to trial, Platt said. Of those, Ford
has won about 70 percent, he said.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani tells business leaders he will take personal hand inupstate economy  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM KATES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Keeping upstate New Yorkers working would
be a ''personal challenge,'' Rudolph Guiliani told a group of
business leaders as he courted their votes for his U.S. Senate run.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani described how he revitalized New York City and what he
would do to help the upstate region share in the downstate's
prosperity as he delivered the keynote address Wednesday night at
the Greater Syracuse Chamber of Commerce's annual dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani told an audience of more than 700 that he not only
would work for lower taxes and less government regulation, but also
would take a personal hand in bringing and keeping jobs in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would negotiate with businesses directly,'' Giuliani said in
a 30-minute speech. ''Sitting down and talking with them to solve
their problems, fighting to keep them in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said New York City's success in lowering crime, welfare
and increasing jobs could be a model for other communities in New
York. The biggest step in that success was cutting the city's taxes
by $2.3 billion, the Republican mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we did was give you your money back so you had the
freedom to decide how it would be spent. And that has a tremendous
impact on the economy, particularly in a situation like we have
with an overtaxed economy and overtaxed state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among his first tasks, Giuliani told his listeners, would be
reducing the $15 billion disparity in the amount of tax money New
York sends to the federal government and the amount it receives
back.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are subsidizing other parts of America. Well, OK, we're
bigger. We are per capita richer. However, we also need an
appropriate equitable share to help all the communities of New York
... who need more resurgence, who need more assistance in their
economy,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   ''A reduction in income tax, a reduction in other forms of
general taxation, will mean more money in the economy here in
central New York. Money for businesses to grow. For businesses to
invest more in expansion,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani also again criticized the Clinton administration for
not doing enough to curb the skyrocketing fuel prices being endured
across the nation, an escalation he said was fostered by Clinton's
lack of a ''focused, determined foreign policy'' and reluctance to
stand up against OPEC. Giuliani repeated his call for the
administration to release oil from the nation's reserves to push
prices back down.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani was scheduled to return to Syracuse again Saturday to
march along side Mayor Roy Bernardi in the city's annual St.
Patrick's Day Parade.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton also was tentatively scheduled to take
part in the parade but had to drop out because of a conflicting
commitment. The first lady spent last Friday campaigning in
Cortland and Ithaca and already has made more campaign swings
through upstate New York than Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ''He needs to really concentrate on upstate. He knows he needs
to get into the upstate area, and at least spend as much time here
as Hillary Clinton,'' observed Bernardi, a fellow Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ''People here like to be able to talk to you, to see you in
their diner, see you at their chicken barbecue. You can't do it
from afar,'' Bernardi said.

<HEADLINE> Man Arrested in Florida Abduction  </HEADLINE>
By RON WORD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- A 38-year-old man was arrested
Wednesday and charged with last week's abduction of a 10-year-old
girl who was snatched getting off her school bus and released three
days later.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest came hours after investigators seized a green Jeep
Cherokee from one of two homes searched Wednesday. Investigators
said the vehicle matched the description of the one used in the
March 6 kidnapping outside Trenton, about 20 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, James Paul Johnson, was picked up at a mental
health center in Alachua County, where he had checked himself in,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ''With this arrest, the community can rest a little easier
tonight,'' said Ken Tucker, regional director of the Florida
Department of Law Enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Alachua County Sheriff Stephen Oelrich said a woman came forward
and pointed investigators towards Johnson. He said the woman
described both his car and his home.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is charged with one count of kidnapping and one count of
kidnapping with special circumstances. The special circumstances
are lewd and lascivious acts against a child under the age of 13.
</P>
<P>
   He also was charged with one count of sexual battery on a child
under the age of 11 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was being held in Alachua County Jail in lieu of $1
million bond, pending a court appearance scheduled for Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney Rod Smith said Johnson was identified by the
child in a photo lineup earlier Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The victim, Jessica Rodriguez, was abducted on a shady dirt
driveway to her rural home northwest of Gainesville by a man
driving a green sport utility vehicle. She was let go three days
later at a Gainesville Wal-Mart and reported to be in good
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities had said Jessica was abducted by a man driving a
green suburban sport utility vehicle. They had appealed to the
public for tips.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, The Associated Press does not identify the
victims of sexual assault. In this case, however, the name of the
victim had been widely used because of the circumstances of her
abduction.
</P>
<P>
   A 9-year-old girl in Putnam County, east of Gainesville, said a
man approached her March 1 who resembled the composite drawing of
the kidnapper of Jessica.
</P>
<P>
   That man also was reported to be driving a green Jeep Cherokee.
The 9-year-old girl ran away as another car approached.
</P>
<P>
   Two homes were searched Wednesday, one in a neighborhood north
of the University of Florida where investigators removed
mattresses, sheets, several boxes and some pictures. A metal shed
was also seized.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said after Jessica turned up safe that they believed
her abductor kept her in a house with an in-ground swimming pool, a
privacy fence, a shed and a barking dog.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors of the home searched near the University of Florida
said the family has a dog and a backyard pool.

<HEADLINE> Gov.'s Alleged Payoff Not in Video  </HEADLINE>
By NATALIE GOTT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- A videotape secretly taken inside the
office of former Gov. Edwin Edwards was played at his racketeering
trial on Wednesday, showing a former U.S. congressman handling cash
while Edwards talked about deals for casino licenses.
</P>
<P>
   But the tape fell short of an earlier prosecution claim that it
showed Edwards actually making a payoff.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors showed the tape of Edwards with Cleo Fields as they
continued pressing their claim that the former governor extorted
$400,000 from former San Francisco 49ers owner Edward DeBartolo Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Fields, also a former member of the Louisiana House and now a
state senator, is not charged and held no office when the tape was
made in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, his son Stephen, state Sen. Greg Tarver and four others
have been on trial in federal court since Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors claim the men took part in a series of bribery and
extortion schemes aimed at manipulating the licensing of casino
riverboats during and after Edwards' fourth and final term, which
ended in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The tape was long awaited, but its link to the DeBartolo license
was not immediately clear. And it failed to show everything
prosecutors had earlier claimed.
</P>
<P>
   In January opening statements, they said the tape showed Edwards
handing a bundle of cash to Fields. However, the camera the FBI had
hidden in Edwards' private office was not running when Edwards
allegedly handed over the money.
</P>
<P>
   An agent monitoring the meeting neglected to turn on the camera
until after the meeting had begun, according to testimony.
</P>
<P>
   A later portion of the tape shows Edwards telling Fields that
people he is working with ''are claiming that offer they made was
contingent on getting a license,'' and shows Fields fishing a
bundle of cash out of his pocket.

<HEADLINE> China Threat Looms in Taiwan  </HEADLINE>
By MARCOS CALO MEDINA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINMEN, Taiwan (AP) -- Between the windswept coastlines of this
Taiwanese island and mainland China is a narrow strait of choppy
waters, guarded day and night on both sides by soldiers and heavy
artillery.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the Chinese guns pointing at Kinmen, also known as
Quemoy, this military outpost two miles from China seems unworried
about Beijing's latest threats of war.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't feel the pressure or tension from China anymore. We
just go about our business quietly,'' says fisherman Ou Yang
Yan-chun, standing beside his fleet of two fishing boats in
Kinmen's harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I rarely hear the sound of guns these days,'' says Ou Yang,
recalling the 1950s when Kinmen was an almost daily target of a
Chinese artillery bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Party held on to Kinmen after it
lost mainland China to Mao Zedong's Communists in 1949. Beijing
still views Taiwan to be a renegade province that must be taken
back by force if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Beijing issued a new threat, warning that it would
attack if Taiwan rebuffed indefinitely talks about reunifying.
Military experts often name Kinmen as a target that China might try
to take hostage to get the rest of Taiwan to agree to its demands.
</P>
<P>
   China's recent harsh words came at a sensitive time, with Taiwan
preparing to hold its second direct presidential election on March
18. During the first presidential vote in 1996, China tested
nuclear-capable missiles near Taiwan's two largest ports.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign buntings and flags provide the few bursts of color
against the backdrop of crumbling courtyard homes made of brick and
stone. All three of the top candidates have visited Kinmen and have
promised development for the military outpost of 50,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Kinmen remains heavily fortified. The few beaches open to the
public still have metal spikes jutting out of the waters, and many
areas along the coast are still protected by barbed wire signs that
read ''Danger Mines.''
</P>
<P>
   A makeshift stage has been set up in downtown Kinmen to receive
ruling party candidate Vice President Lien Chan, and taxi drivers
fly pennants of independent candidate James Soong.
</P>
<P>
   Many polls in Taiwan report a growing reluctance for
reunification with mainland China, but for residents like Ni
chen-kuo, a 47-year old cleaner at Kinmen's harbor, the future lies
with the thriving southern Chinese city of Xiamen across the Taiwan
Strait.
</P>
<P>
   Direct air links from Taiwan to Xiamen would bring more tourists
and more jobs, Ni said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This place is so small, there are so few ways to do business.
We really hope the government can start direct links to over
there,'' says Ni, pointing to the waters beyond Kinmen harbor's
concrete military watchtower.
</P>
<P>
   To appease the many businessmen chafing at the restrictions of
the ban on direct links with China, Lien has proposed setting up a
peace zone in Kinmen and another outlying island, Matsu, to allow
direct shipping links with the mainland. But this all depends on
China giving Taiwan ''concrete signs of goodwill,'' which Lien
hasn't further defined.
</P>
<P>
   Legal links with the mainland could make life easier for Mu
Chi-lin, 37, but she thinks the elections ''won't bring any new
changes.'' Business is on the minds of local residents, and one
candidate ''is just the same as the other,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Life is hard here. China is the topic of every election, but
as long as the streets are quiet, we really don't care,'' said Mu,
standing beside pears and grapes smuggled from mainland China.

<HEADLINE> Study: EMF, Suicide Risk Linked  </HEADLINE>
By RANDALL CHASE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Chronic exposure to low-frequency
electromagnetic fields may be responsible for a higher suicide risk
among electric utility workers, according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
   While unable to prove that exposure causes suicide, researchers
at the University of North Carolina found electricians for five
U.S. power companies had twice the suicide rate and linemen 1{
times the rate of utility workers not employed in those jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The findings appeared Wednesday in the April issue of
Occupational and Environmental Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers studied about 6,000 men who were part of a
larger group of about 139,000 employed as utility workers between
1950 and 1986. Research involving the larger study group has shown
that some workers exposed to high magnetic fields have elevated
cancer rates, but not that EMF exposure causes cancer.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation for the possible link between exposure and
suicide is that electromagnetic fields are thought to suppress
melatonin levels in the body, said Edwin van Wijngaarden, a
doctoral student and lead author of the UNC study.
</P>
<P>
   ''The EMF-cancer link is pretty controversial,'' van Wijngaarden
said. ''This may also be controversial, but at least there is a
more plausible biological mechanism involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland deep in the
brain, is thought to play a key role in a person's sleep cycle and
mood.
</P>
<P>
   ''There does seem to be a link between melatonin levels and
depression,'' said study co-author David Savitz, a professor and
chair of epidemiology at UNC.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said it isn't known exactly how electromagnetic
fields might inhibit melatonin production.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Kripke, a California researcher who has studied the
relationship between EMFs in the home and melatonin levels, said he
had not seen the UNC study but questioned the role that melatonin
might play.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an area where there is a lot of speculation,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 study by Canadian researchers found no link between
suicide and EMF exposure. But Savitz said the UNC study was
significantly larger than the Canadian study of workers at a Quebec
utility company.
</P>
<P>
   Van Wijngaarden said the results of the study may not be
applicable to the general population because the study group was so
selective.
</P>
<P>
   UNC researchers looked at data compiled over several years from
employees of Carolina Power &AMP; Light Co., Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric,
PECO Energy Co. (formerly Philadelphia Electric Co.), Virginia
Electric Power Co. and the Tennessee Valley Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Van Wijngaarden and his colleagues found 536 suicides among the
group between 1950 and 1986 and compared them to a control group of
5,348 non-suicides of the same race and age.
</P>
<P>
   Suicide is the eighth leading cause of death in the United
States; 30,000 people took their lives in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Drug May Help Kids With Arthritis  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF DONN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   A genetically engineered drug works well in fighting children's
arthritis, according to a new study that promises the biggest leap
in drug therapy in more than a decade for the sometimes disabling
ailment.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in today's New England Journal of Medicine,
was funded in part by the drug's manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 100,000 American children suffer from the stiff joints
of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. At least 20,000 -- and possibly
many more -- would appear to be good candidates for the new drug,
known as etanercept or by the brand name Enbrel, doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   The results suggest a long-awaited alternative for children who
don't respond to the widely used drug methotrexate, which has been
given to children for more than 10 years. Though the older drug
helps about two-thirds of children, there have been few good
choices for the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's where etanercept saves the day,'' said Dr. Daniel
Lovell of Children's Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati, the
lead author of the study.
</P>
<P>
   The research was carried out at nine institutions. Some funding
for the research came from the drug's manufacturer, Immunex Corp.
of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   In the tests on 51 children over seven months, the new drug
appeared to control the disease for 72 percent of the patients.
Given in twice-weekly injections, it had limited side effects, the
researchers said. Though the study included only children with
inflammation in at least five joints, the drug also may work for
other types of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Partly on the strength of the study's unpublished results, the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved children's use of
etanercept a year ago, and some doctors have been prescribing it.
It already had been approved for adults.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is helping to spur the development of a new class of
drugs that work by binding to tumor necrosis factor, neutralizing
this hormone-like substance that promotes inflammation in human
cells. Such drugs hold promise for a range of conditions, such as
psoriasis and congestive heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   However, the new drugs are expensive. Lovell said a child's
annual treatment would cost $3,000 to $12,000, though health
insurers are generally covering the therapy to some degree.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Pisetsky of Duke University Medical Center cautioned
in an editorial in the journal that, ''The new era of better
treatment for arthritis will not be realized until society's
solutions to issues of cost, access, and reimbursement match the
beauty of the science.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Fox of the University of Michigan said that while
etanercept appears to hold great promise, some doctors are awaiting
results from longer term studies.

<HEADLINE> Easton to get free gun locks in program sponsored by gun industry  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EASTON, Conn. (AP) -- Easton police will hand out free gun locks
as part of a national gun safety program sponsored by a sports
foundation that represents leading gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty cities and towns across the country are already
participating in ''Project Home Safe,'' sponsored by the National
Shooting Sports Foundation, a Newtown-based trade group
representing about 1,800 gun, munitions and accessory
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, cable locks are distributed by police
departments or local government officials.
</P>
<P>
   The locks, which resemble bicycle cable locks, are pulled
through gun handles or barrels to prevent the weapon from firing.
When the lock is in place, the gun cannot be loaded or fired. They
differ from trigger locks, which keep the trigger from being
pulled, but can remain loaded while the lock is in place.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Painter, executive director of the sports foundation, said
the program is aimed at homeowners who buy guns for protection and
do not have the kind of safety training that many hunters and sport
shooters do.
</P>
<P>
   Painter said he began developing the program in 1998, about a
year before more than 20 cities across the country began filing
lawsuits against the gun industry seeking to force manufacturers to
provide effective safety devices with their guns.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has nothing to do with public relations,'' he said. ''It
has to do with a substantial and very real issue of addressing
public safety.''
</P>
<P>
   The program started in September in five pilot cities, including
Las Vegas, Pittsburgh, Orlando, Fla., Augusta, Ga., and Oakland,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Another 90 cities and towns are ready to begin this summer,
Painter said. So far, 50,000 locks have been distributed. Painter
said the group hopes to distribute one million locks over the next
three years.
</P>
<P>
   Easton Police Chief John Solomon said police have invited local
gun owners to attend a meeting at the public library Tuesday
evening, when officers will hand out the locks and demonstrate how
to use them.
</P>
<P>
   ''For every one of those safety locks that goes into a residence
in this town, that's one less possibility of a tragedy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cromwell police Chief Anthony Salvatore, the newly elected
president of the Connecticut Police Chiefs Association, said he
expects other communities to join the program. Salvatore dismissed
complaints by critics who say the cable locks -- because they take
time to unlock -- would slow down a homeowner trying to protect
himself from an intruder.
</P>
<P>
   ''The chances of a child getting hold of a gun and accidentally
firing the weapon are far greater than you having to confront an
intruder in your house,'' Salvatore said.
</P>
<P>
   Easton is not the first community in the state to hand out free
gun locks.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport has handed out hundreds of free trigger locks over
the last year. The city was one of more than two dozen communities
across the country to file lawsuits against the gun industry.
Bridgeport's suit was thrown out by a judge in December, but city
officials have promised to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   What is unusual about the Easton program is that it is sponsored
by a group representing the gun industry.
</P>
<P>
   Painter said the gun industry has been promoting safety for more
than 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Some gun manufacturers already ship locks with new guns.
</P>
<P>
   Fairfield-based Sturm, Ruger ships its pistols and revolvers in
lock boxes with padlocks. Exeter, N.H.,-based Sigarms Corp. ships
its guns with trigger locks.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Duby, a spokesman for Bridgeport Mayor Joseph P. Ganim,
called the sports foundation's gun lock program ''laudable,'' but
said it is long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just maybe an indication that the gun industry is
beginning to get it,'' Duby said. ''The fundamentals of gun safety
require that trigger locks or other locks be used.''

<HEADLINE> High court upholds firing of prison guard  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA TOMMELLEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Sen. Alvin Penn is ready to forgive. But
he won't forget.
</P>
<P>
   The Bridgeport Democrat, who is black, drew the wrath of a
former state prison guard who left a barrage of vulgarities and
racial slurs on Penn's voice mail during a bitter 1997 debate over
a labor contract for corrections officers.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Gregory Frederick was arrested for second-degree
harassment and fired over the incident. An arbitrator's ruling in
April, 1998 reinstated him with back pay. The state fought the
ruling and won. But Frederick's union, Council 4 of the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, took the
matter to the state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the high court unanimously ruled that Frederick's
firing was warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a Christian and a human being, I forgive him,'' said Penn.
''But as a senator, I have an obligation to make sure he's not back
in there doing any more detrimental harm to young minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Frederick worked at the John R. Manson Youth Center in Cheshire,
and was calling from work when he placed the obscenity-laced call.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was very concerned and am still concerned about that type of
behavior coming from someone who is dealing with juveniles who are
incarcerated and are looking for rehabilitation and guidance,''
said Penn.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's decision comes nearly two years after
Frederick was ordered reinstated by the state Board of Mediation
and Arbitration, which ruled the message was ''rampant'' with
vulgarities but not ''hate-filled words.''
</P>
<P>
   The high court, in a 5-0 ruling, strongly disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is hard to imagine a more repugnant message than that left
by the employee,'' wrote Senior Justice Ellen A. Peters. ''The fact
that this egregious misconduct ... occurred while the employee was
on the job distinguishes it from other cases of employee misconduct
in which courts have upheld arbitral awards that reduced
sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   Frederick admitted making the call from the prison to Penn's
voice mail on May 15, 1997 after Penn helped squelch new contracts
for prison guards in a vote before the General Assembly. The
message was left anonymously, but Frederick admitted to
investigators the next day that he made the call.
</P>
<P>
   Penn said the ruling sends the proper message to the rest of the
state that such matters are taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had seen nothing in his behavior which would indicate to me
that he was sorry other than for the fact that he was sorry that he
got caught,'' said Penn. ''I'm glad he's out.''
</P>
<P>
   The arbitrator's ruling, said the justices, violated a
well-defined state policy that warrants the firing of state workers
who break the law and regulations of the Department of Correction.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick was granted a special form of probation on the
harassment charge. Under the terms of his accelerated
rehabilitation he was ordered to serve two years probation and 300
hours of community service.
</P>
<P>
   The court also noted the arbitrator tried to excuse Frederick's
behavior because of stress due to personal problems. His older
daughter had been diagnosed with diabetes and his wife was
experiencing complications in a pregnancy around the same time the
Senate rejected the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lesser sanction ... would, very simply, send the message
that stress, or poor judgment, or other factors, somehow renders
the conduct permissible or excusable,'' wrote Justice Flemming
Norcutt Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick could not be reached for comment. There is no
telephone listing for him in Cheshire. Calls to the union seeking
comment on the case were not returned.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers get first glance of Adriaen's Landing legislation  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- House Speaker Moira Lyons says it's too
early to tell how much support there is for Gov. John G. Rowland's
plan to spend $455 million of state money on the Adriaen's Landing
development project in downtown Hartford and a 40,000-seat football
stadium in East Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   After scanning a 45-page preliminary spending bill for the first
time on Wednesday, Lyons said her colleagues need some time to
digest the fine print.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want the opportunity to read the bill carefully, and after
that we will probably have (state agency officials) come in and
address our additional questions,'' said Lyons, D-Stamford.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons said she expects a public hearing to be held on the bill
March 30. A vote in the House would come by mid-April, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader George Jepsen said he senses support for
the plan in his caucus, something Rowland is banking on.
</P>
<P>
   ''There really isn't any organized opposition,'' Rowland said.
''There will be people who say maybe the stadium should be in
Storrs, or maybe it should be facing north instead of south. But
these are small issues in the scheme of things.''
</P>
<P>
   But some lawmakers are focused on what they call bigger
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edith Prague, D-Columbia, doesn't like the current proposal
any more than the plan to build the Patriots a stadium. Prague said
the General Assembly is rushing into spending too much money
without enough consideration of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think this is a good expenditure of taxpayer money and
I'm not going to vote for it,'' Prague said. ''I know the governor
is going to be clubbing people over the head to get the votes ...
but I don't think this is any better for Hartford than the
(Patriots) stadium was.''
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature is being asked to commit $455 million in public
funds to the development, on the condition that at least $210
million in private investment can be raised.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland has said the project has drawn about $295 million in
private corporate commitments.
</P>
<P>
   The project includes a 700-room hotel, a convention center,
260,000 square feet of entertainment and retail space and nearly
400 housing units. About 3,400 construction jobs and more than
1,100 permanent jobs are expected to be created.
</P>
<P>
   The Adriaen's Landing plan has morphed since first proposed two
years ago when it expected to revolve around a football stadium for
the New England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   When the Patriots backed out of the deal last year, there was
talk of building a domed stadium on the site to house the
University of Connecticut's football program.
</P>
<P>
   But plans changed again when United Technologies Corp. donated
its 75-acre Rentschler Field in East Hartford for the UConn
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The school is upgrading from Division I-AA to Division I-A and
needs at least a 35,000-seat stadium to make the transition.

<HEADLINE> Sale, possession of so-called party or date-rape drug now a felonyin Conn.  </HEADLINE>
By NATASHA GURAL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The death of an East Lyme man blamed on a
mix of alcohol and GHB has prompted the state to make it a felony
to sell or possess the party or date-rape drug.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature this week approved an amendment placing gamma
hydroxy butyrate and similar chemical substances on the state's
roster of permanently controlled substances.
</P>
<P>
   ''It basically gives the local police departments a tool to help
control this problem,'' said Leo Roberge, director of the Drug
Control Division of the state Department of Consumer Protection.
''It isn't a huge problem here, but we've had a couple of problems
in Connecticut including the fatality.''
</P>
<P>
   The state medical examiner's office concluded that Andrew W.
Hayes of East Lyme died of the effects of combining GHB with
alcohol after a night of drinking with friends on April 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The state's action comes a month after President Clinton signed
legislation toughening federal laws against possessing, making or
distributing GHB. The bill is named for two teen-agers who died
after GHB was slipped into their soft drinks -- Hillory J. Farias of
Texas and 15-year-old Samantha Reid of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, three young men were convicted in Michigan of
involuntary manslaughter in the GHB death of Reid. A fourth was
convicted of a lesser charge.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Consumer Protection took unprecedented
action in August, classifying GHB and similar chemical substances
as Schedule IV controlled drugs.
</P>
<P>
   GHB, when mixed into a drink can render a victim unconscious
within 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Previously sold as dietary supplements, GHB and its chemical
archetype GBL (gamma butyolactone), have gained popularity among
young people because they provide the relaxed, uninhibited feeling
of a few drinks but faster and cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Usually sold as a colorless and odorless liquid but sometimes as
a powder, GHB can also cause vomiting, sudden comas and seizures.
First developed in Europe as a surgical anesthetic, it depresses
breathing.
</P>
<P>
   The first state case of GHB-related illness was reported to the
Connecticut Poison Control Center at the University of Connecticut
Health Center in 1996. At least seven young people were treated in
two days at Connecticut hospitals after ingesting GHB during the
second week of June.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, GHB has been linked to at least 58 deaths since 1990
and more than 5,700 recorded overdoses, according to the Drug
Enforcement Administration.

<HEADLINE> Latvia Waffen SS To Hold Procession  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN C. JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIGA, Latvia (AP) -- Former soldiers in the Latvian Waffen SS
said they would go ahead with a procession to commemorate their
fallen comrades despite the bitter controversy the march has
provoked.
</P>
<P>
   Some 300 Waffen SS veterans, most in their 70s and 80s, are
expected to walk today in procession and lay flowers at a Riga
independence monument.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just want to remember the comrades we lost and teach our
children the truth about what happened to this country in the 20th
century,'' said Visvaldis Lacis, a 76-year-old Waffen SS veteran
and a main organizer of the event.
</P>
<P>
   The annual march, held on March 16 to mark a major battle
between the Latvian Waffen SS and the Red Army on the same date in
1944, provoked a storm of protest at home and abroad the last two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Latvians say the Latvian Waffen SS, also known as the Latvian
Legion, was strictly a front-line army and is confused with the
regular SS -- Adolf Hitler's elite force that carried out mass
executions during the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Russia said the event showed contempt for millions of Soviet war
dead. Members of Latvia's 11,000-strong Jewish community said the
march was insensitive to the memory of 80,000 Latvian Jews
massacred during the 1941-44 Nazi occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Lacis insisted the sole purpose was to remember fellow soldiers
who died in battle.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy was heightened last year after parliament declared
March 16 an official day of remembrance. But earlier this year,
parliament sought to reduce tensions and international criticism by
rescinding that decision.
</P>
<P>
   Latvians say the controversy stems from a misunderstanding of
history.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviets occupied Latvia at the start of the war in 1940,
Germany ruled here from 1941-44, and the Soviets retook it in 1944.
Latvia regained its independence from Moscow in 1991 following the
collapse of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   With Latvia sandwiched between the Nazi and Soviet armies,
250,000 Latvians ended up fighting on one side of the conflict or
the other, usually after being conscripted. Some 150,000 Latvian
combatants died.
</P>
<P>
   Many Latvians, like Lacis, say they volunteered to fight for
Waffen SS on behalf of Latvian independence from the Soviets, not
out of any sympathy for Nazi ideology.
</P>
<P>
   While privately sympathetic, leaders argue that any official
sanction of the day was sure to draw condemnations from around the
world and could even undermine the nation's bid to win membership
in the European Union and NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Nils Muiznieks, a leading political commentator, said the damage
to Latvia's international image has already been done.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is always going to be a black eye for Latvia, regardless
of whether it's a state holiday,'' he said. ''Veterans will march,
cameras will roll ... It's a nightmare from the state's point of
view.''

<HEADLINE> Researchers: Release Patients Sooner  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF DONN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Researchers suggested today that hospitals could safely move
toward releasing heart attack patients without complications after
just three days, instead of the usual five or six.
</P>
<P>
   The cost-benefit analysis, published today in the New England
Journal of Medicine, sharpens an already touchy medical debate.
Shorter stays for heart attacks could raise a public outcry like
the one that led to a 1998 federal law mandating at least two days
of insurance coverage for maternity stays.
</P>
<P>
   Marti Ann Schwartz, who wrote ''Listen to Me, Doctor: Taking
Charge of Your Own Health Care,'' said she fears insurers will
seize on such cost-benefit studies to rush patients out of the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're trying to make up a sheet that the people ... can look
at and say, 'It's five days, we cover three days, and it's
disallowed,''' Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital stays have become much shorter for heart attacks since
the 1950s, when doctors believed patients needed such care for four
to six weeks while the heart muscle healed.
</P>
<P>
   The latest analysis is apt to push the industry toward even
shorter stays, according to its chief author, Dr. Kristin Newby of
Duke Clinical Research Institute in Durham, N.C. She joined
researchers at four other institutions in carrying out the study,
which was funded by pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical
equipment companies Bayer Corp., Genentech Inc., CIBA-Corning, ICI
and Sanofi.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing records of 22,361 patients, the researchers calculated
that very few -- perhaps as few as 13 -- benefited from a fourth day
in the hospital. For an average patient, the fourth day yields only
another 2.2 days in life expectancy.
</P>
<P>
   So it would take another 166 days in the hospital for another
year of life expectancy. Thus, at $624 a day in extra hospital and
doctor costs, it would cost more than $100,00 for an additional
year of life expectancy -- more than double the $50,000 figure for
kidney dialysis. The kidney procedure is widely used as a benchmark
for deciding if medical care is worth the social benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Overall savings from shorter heart attack stays could be
considerable, since more than 1 million Americans suffer heart
attacks each year. About 60 percent have no complicating
conditions, Newby said.
</P>
<P>
   However, she acknowledged that most hospitals aren't yet set up
to give patients all the pre-discharge testing, rehabilitation and
advice they may need within three days.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is really outlining a possibility, if we could make our
system more efficient,'' Newby said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Donald Young, medical director of the Health Insurance
Association of America, said the study raises points that should be
considered. ''Health care dollars are limited, and we need to know
what works and what doesn't work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While also welcoming the study, some doctors extended cautions.
They said it is very difficult to decide which patients are at
highest risk.
</P>
<P>
   Cardiologist Lynn Smaha, president of the American Heart
Association, said he felt ''mixed feelings'' about the analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're all trying to do what we can to reduce the cost. At the
same time, we have to keep up the quality of care. Cost should not
be the prime motivator,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the conclusions of the analysis may be muddied by the
fact that the patients did receive the fourth day of hospital care
-- and possibly benefits that are hard to quantify.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial in the journal, Boston-based doctors Elliott
Antman at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Karen Kuntz at Harvard
School of Public Health questioned if there is enough evidence for
the safety of pre-discharge stress testing within three days of a
heart attack. Such testing monitors the heart's recovery by putting
the patient on a treadmill.

<HEADLINE> Boy's Right Arm Torn Off by Tiger  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHANNELVIEW, Texas (AP) -- A pet Bengal tiger tore off part of a
3-year-old's right arm Wednesday after the little boy reached into
the animal's cage, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Jayton Tidwell was alert when he arrived at Memorial Hermann
Children's Hospital for surgery. Doctors hoped to reattach the
limb, which was separated at mid-bicep.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was awake, he was conscious, he was crying a little bit,''
Dr. Richard Bradley told the Houston Chronicle. ''I didn't want to
stress him out any more than he was, so I didn't ask him if he knew
what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Harris County Sheriff's Department said the
boy was alone when he walked up to the cage and stuck his arm
inside. The animal is his uncle's pet.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbor Tracy Olivas said she heard the boy screaming when the
attack occurred. She said the tiger, named Cheyenne, is 4 years old
and weighs about 400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's a really nice and passive animal,'' said Olivas, adding
that her 17-year-old daughter often pets the declawed creature.
</P>
<P>
   Olivas said she saw the boy, who is from Brazoria, 50 miles
south of Houston, right after the attack and ''he was in shock. His
arm was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Tidwell, the boy's uncle and owner of the home where the
tiger is kept as a pet, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Animal control officers planned to go to the home Thursday to
investigate. The tiger was left in the cage overnight Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Kennedy Expected To Win 7th Term  </HEADLINE>
By CAREN BENJAMIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The last time Massachusetts Sen. Edward
Kennedy sought re-election, he faced one of the stiffest challenges
of his long political career. This time around, he may not even
break a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Until this week, it appeared that Kennedy's Republican
challenger would be Michael J. Sullivan, district attorney in
Plymouth County, Mass. But Sullivan had little money or name
recognition despite a solid political background that includes
three terms in the Massachusetts House and two terms as district
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   And early Thursday, he told The Associated Press he would not be
running for the Senate. He cited several reasons, including a
distaste for fund raising, satisfaction in his current job and his
four school-age children.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said he understood that Jack E. Robinson III, a former
Eastern Airlines executive now running a cellular phone firm, would
run in his place.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kennedy got a real scare in 1994,'' said Jennifer Duffy, an
analyst for the Cook Political Report. ''He learned the lessons you
learn from that kind of experience. He raised a lot of money early,
he tended the home fires. He's been running for this election ever
since.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is Kennedy, 68, now appears to have among the safest
seats in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no one alive who can beat Ted Kennedy,'' said
Democratic political consultant Michael Goldman of Boston. ''And
Abraham Lincoln would have a problem if he were to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Most campaign watchers had given Sullivan, 45, about the same
odds as the race's other two candidates: Libertarian Carla Howell,
whose mantra is ''Small government is beautiful,'' and Philip Hyde,
running as a ''timesizer'' who says he can eliminate poverty,
racism, sexism, unemployment and homelessness by shortening the
work week to 30 hours.
</P>
<P>
   In 37 years in the Senate, Kennedy has made a name for himself
as a champion of progressive causes, from voting and civil rights
to raising the minimum wage and universal health coverage. But his
triumphs often were obscured by personal problems, most notably his
decision to leave the scene of a fatal car accident in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   During his 1994 re-election bid, Kennedy still was dealing with
fallout from the rape trial of his nephew, William Kennedy Smith.
Kennedy testified at the trial and acknowledged going to a bar with
his son, Rep. Patrick Kennedy, and Smith, who while there met the
woman who later claimed she was raped. Kennedy suffered politically
even though Smith was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was also up against the notion that the new Democrats had
taken over, and old liberal icons were a bit out of date,'' said
Paul Watanabe, a political science professor at the University of
Massachusetts, Boston. ''All of that seemed to indicate he was
potentially ripe for the picking.''
</P>
<P>
   The race was bruising. Republican candidate Mitt Romney spent
$7.6 million and attacked Kennedy repeatedly. Kennedy painted his
opponent as a heartless capitalist.
</P>
<P>
   It was a close race until Kennedy ran an ad blitz featuring
workers laid off from an Indiana company financed by Romney's
business. In the end, Kennedy beat Romney 58 percent to 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy will not comment on potential opponents, his spokesman
Will Keyser said. But Goldman, the Democratic consultant, said
Massachusetts voters don't buy the concept of a blue-collar
Republican. And Kennedy has made a career out of helping the poor
and middle class, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone in the state knows that Ted Kennedy can deliver,''
Goldman said. ''If you're voter, why the heck would you want to get
rid of someone like that?''

<HEADLINE> Sod Farms a Growing Trend on Farms  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE (AP) -- Sod is crowding out corn, cows and wheat on
some North Carolina farms to meet a voracious demand for grass that
doesn't need time to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is clearly a case of the grass being greener,'' said Gene
Maples, executive director of the Turfgrass Council of North
Carolina. ''All you have to do is drive around a few subdivisions
and you can see.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of sod farms in North Carolina has nearly doubled in
the past two years, to about 50, industry officials estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1992 and 1997, the last year the U.S. Department of
Agriculture calculated figures, sod production increased faster in
North Carolina than in any other state except Idaho and Montana.
Sod farms covered 4,500 acres in North Carolina in 1997, up from
1,700 acres in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in sod farming is directly related to the Carolinas'
phenomenal building boom, said Charles Peacock, a professor of turf
management at North Carolina State University.
</P>
<P>
   Developers who once planted their own grass seed in subdivisions
now are more likely to sod new yards.
</P>
<P>
   Rapid golf course construction also has boosted sales. Even the
North Carolina Department of Transportation is laying centipede
grass under guardrails because it is convenient and requires less
maintenance than other kinds of grass.
</P>
<P>
   Sod farm sales in the Carolinas reached $33.2.million in 1997,
according to USDA figures. Experts say the number is now much
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Harper, a builder by trade who used to grow corn, started
AFH Farms six years ago after realizing that the Charlotte region's
sod supply wasn't matching demand. He planted 20 acres of sod at
the outset on the Mecklenburg-Cabarrus line, harvested 300 acres
last year and by 2005 hopes to double that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, dairy farmers Allan and Ted Williams of Olin sowed 10
acres of sod last year, with plans to grow 15 acres this year. The
Williamses, who still have some beef cattle, could plant as many as
300 acres in Iredell, the state's leading dairy county.
</P>
<P>
   The Williamses and others have discovered sod farming is just as
demanding and precarious as traditional agriculture. It involves
trimming the large fields several times a week and constantly
monitoring fertilizers and watering.
</P>
<P>
   Besides unpredictable weather, sod farmers worry about a single
weed sneaking onto their property. It's also not cheap. Allan
Williams figures he and his sons invested more than $100,000 in
equipment to launch their farm, including a $48,000 harvester that
undercuts the grass and soil, then bundles it into tightly wound
spirals. They still have to buy an expensive truck to haul their
sod.
</P>
<P>
   Builders say sod eliminates angry calls from home buyers whose
seeded lawns washed away. Sod is quick, too. Some farms offer
same-day delivery. A seeded lawn takes at least four weeks to
thrive.
</P>
<P>
   ''The day we lay the sod, they have a pretty, green front
yard,'' said Bill Miley, Colony Homes president in Charlotte. ''We
don't have to wait for the seed to germinate -- or hope that it
germinates.''
</P>
<P>
   Price is the main drawback. Builders pay about $200 to seed the
front yard of a home on a typical lot measuring just less than a
quarter-acre, Miley said. Sodding the same lawn costs about $1,000,
with the costs passed along to the home buyer.

<HEADLINE> Hispanic Dropout Numbers Alarming  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN, AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hispanic students are twice as likely as
blacks and three times as likely as whites to drop out of high
school, according to Education Department statistics that suggest
the nation is ill-equipped to deal with the fastest-growing group
of schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Education Secretary Richard Riley, hoping to create a brighter
future for these children, is asking public school districts to
establish in the next five years 1,000 new dual-language schools
that instruct children in English and in a native language such as
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we see to it that immigrants and their children can speak
only English and nothing more, then we will have missed one of the
greatest opportunities of this new century,'' Riley said Wednesday.
''It is high time we begin to treat language skills as the asset
they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley said dual language instruction has proven to help Hispanic
children do better academically as well as preserve children's
heritage and promote bilingualism that can help students in an
increasingly global economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, too many teachers and administrators today
treat a child's native language as a weakness if it is not
English,'' Riley said, speaking at Bell Multicultural High School,
which is not one of the nation's 260 dual-language schools. ''In
some places, even the idea of bilingual education is controversial.
It shouldn't be.''
</P>
<P>
   Dual-language instruction is one of three main, often hotly
debated approaches to teaching the 3 million U.S. students with
limited English proficiency, of which nearly 75 percent are
Hispanic. These students, designated by school tests and other
measures as non-English speakers, also are taught in English-only
classes or completely in their native languages.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative critics of dual-language schools said Wednesday
that such instruction doesn't necessarily give non-English speakers
the language immersion necessary to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ''You are basically using Hispanic kids to help teach
English-speaking kids Spanish,'' said Jorge Amselle of the Center
for Equal Opportunity, a Washington-based group critical of current
bilingual education programs.
</P>
<P>
   While Hispanic children are more likely than other kids to come
from poor families where they don't have good access to health care
and preschool classes that would make them better students, Riley
recounted statistics indicating that language is the chief barrier
to learning.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, 25.3 percent of Hispanics ages 16 to 24 had dropped out
of high school, compared with 13.4 percent of blacks and 7.6
percent of whites.
</P>
<P>
   The dropout rates for Hispanics are linked to a student's
language difficulties. Nearly half of foreign-born Hispanic
students drop out, while just 16 percent of Hispanic students born
in the United States leave school, Riley said. And among U.S.- born
students who had at least one foreign-born parent, the dropout rate
was higher at 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While 11 percent of Hispanics age 25 to 29 possessed at least a
bachelor's degree, 14.2 percent of blacks and 32.6 percent of
whites had finished college.
</P>
<P>
   And there are fewer teachers who can teach bilingual students.
While 54 percent of the nation's classrooms have students in need
of English instruction, just 20 percent of teachers say they feel
prepared to teach them, the department said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Parents and educators want all children to learn English
because it is essential for success,'' Riley said, disclosing the
latest research on Hispanic students. ''But, whatever the approach
to teaching English, it cannot be simply a defensive or reactive
one.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with dual-language schools, said Amselle, is that
nearly half of them have a 9-to-1 ratio of non-English students.
</P>
<P>
   ''It really is Spanish immersion, and that's great for English
speakers, but not so great for the Spanish speakers,'' Amselle
said, adding that many parents have opposed such schools.
</P>
<P>
   But at Oyster Elementary in Washington, a 325-student school
where every child learns everything equally in Spanish and in
English, children are successful, Principal Paquita Holland said.
</P>
<P>
   Each classroom has two teachers who divide the children into two
groups. While one group is solving math problems in English; the
other is doing the same math lesson in Spanish. At the end of the
semester or quarter, the groups switch languages.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half the children there are poor and 56 percent are
Hispanic, yet seven in 10 have scored at or above grade level on
recent standardized reading and math tests, Holland said.

<HEADLINE> Truckers To Protest in D.C.  </HEADLINE>
By DERRILL HOLLY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the second time in less than a month,
independent truckers, seeking relief from fuel prices that have
more than doubled in the past year, plan to converge on the
nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like to see some immediate release of money for these
truckers,'' said John Grasso, an owner-operator from Hammonton,
N.J., explaining why he was returning to lobby members of Congress
again today.
</P>
<P>
   The National Owner Operators Trucking Association brought 283
truckers here from the northeastern United States on Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
   The group has obtained permits for up to 2,500 demonstrators at
two sites today, but just five trucks will be allowed on the
Capitol grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to encourage the American public to support our
plight,'' said Thomas Pokrywka, president of the truckers'
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the group plan to park their trailers at various
locations surrounding the National Mall but will still bring
hundreds of tractor cabs into Washington from six different routes
through Maryland and Virginia. They'll travel after morning
rush-hour in hopes of minimizing traffic disruptions, Pokrywka
said.
</P>
<P>
   Truckers contend that diesel prices above $2 a gallon threaten
many truckers livelihoods and will soon force price increases on
food and other merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could see it as early as this summer,'' said Pokrywka,
adding that owner-operators are pursuing new contracts with
shippers to boost rates and include fuel surcharges to offset their
rising costs.
</P>
<P>
   The truckers' group has found some members of Congress
supportive of their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Costs are threatening to ruin them financially and put them
out of business,'' said Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., who backs
$100 million in emergency relief for owner-operators in the current
federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli and Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo., have
introduced a measure that would roll back the 24-cent-per-gallon
federal tax on diesel fuel, retroactive to Jan. 1. The bill would
enable truckers to apply for rebates based upon fuel receipts
detailing their use.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell drove a truck to finance his college education and last
December attended truck driving school to renew his commercial
driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   ''Vacation and tourist spots all over the country are bracing
for a bad summer,'' if prices don't drop, said Rep. J.C. Watts,
R-Okla.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Going High Tech  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court plans to open its own Web
site sometime soon, but don't expect Justice David H. Souter to go
online to check it out.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am a computer illiterate,'' Souter cheerfully told members
of a House Appropriations subcommittee as he and Justice Clarence
Thomas presented the court's proposed budget for fiscal 2001 on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody around me is using computers,'' Souter continued.
''I get away with it simply because my clerks'' and others at the
court do use computers to get the work done.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said the court plans to open its own Web site sometime in
the near future and is moving forward with computerizing its
internal work.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our job is rather portable with computers,'' Thomas said.
''We're able to work any place in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Souter is known around the court as an ascetic type who
typically lunches on yogurt and an apple. Four years ago, he told
the subcommittee that the day a television camera comes into the
Supreme Court chamber, ''it's going to roll over my dead body.''
</P>
<P>
   He told panel members Wednesday he is not the only person at the
court who isn't looking forward to a proposed major renovation of
the Supreme Court building.
</P>
<P>
   The renovation, intended to improve wiring, security and other
basic features, is expected to begin in the next several years at
an estimated cost of $100 million -- a figure subcommittee chairman
Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., said has ''raised a lot of eyebrows.''
</P>
<P>
   Souter said, ''Everybody in the Supreme Court would like to
postpone the whole thing until he retires. We look upon the whole
thing with a certain degree of horror.''
</P>
<P>
   Subcommittee members asked Souter and Thomas about the court's
record of hiring minority law clerks. The justices have been
criticized in recent years by civil rights groups and some members
of Congress who contend too few minorities have been chosen for the
plum jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Each justice hires three or four recent law school graduates to
help screen new cases and research and draft opinions. The one-year
jobs often lead to high-paying posts in law firms or law schools.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 35 law clerks currently working for the nine justices
are five minority clerks -- two blacks and three Asian-Americans. In
previous years, there generally have not been more than three
minority clerks.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no question that the subject is on the minds of those
who are pushing people in our direction,'' Souter said. Thomas
added, ''There's certainly been heightened awareness of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif., said, ''As long as I serve on the
committee it's not going to go away.''

<HEADLINE> Kids Charged With Murder Conspiracy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT TOWNSEND, Wash. (AP) -- A 12-year-old boy and 14-year-old
girl were charged Wednesday with conspiracy to commit murder for
allegedly plotting to shoot their middle school classmates.
</P>
<P>
   Both were charged as juveniles. If they are convicted,
prosecutors will seek to keep them in custody until they are 21.
The standard sentencing range for juveniles convicted of the felony
is 15 to 36 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they had a note detailing the plan of Paul
Mascho and Jill Martin, written by the girl to another student.
</P>
<P>
   The note said one person would be shot 15 times in the head,
telephone lines would be cut, walkie-talkies would be used and the
shooting would start in the office of Chimacum Middle School,
according to an affidavit filed by sheriff's detective Joe Nole.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-year-old said he came up with the scheme because he was
angry at most of the students and staff, Nole's statement said.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as we can tell, they wanted to get administration
people in general, one specific juvenile and one classroom,''
prosecutor Michael Haas said. He said it appeared the girl only
planned to participate in cutting telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   The plan hit a snag when the boy arrived in Tacoma on Feb. 29
with a 14-year-old cousin, planning to enlist five or six of his
cousin's gang-member friends but learning they were all in jail,
Nole said.
</P>
<P>
   Chimacum District Superintendent Mary Lynne Derrington said
security was ''quadrupled'' after the plan was revealed.

<HEADLINE> Aviation Bill Goes To President  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A $40 billion aviation bill on its way to the
president's desk promises more money for airport construction, more
flights out of major airports and higher local airport passenger
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The massive bill, which passed the House Wednesday by 319-101,
also seeks to help smaller airports become more competitive,
requires cargo planes to install collision-avoidance systems and
even sets standards for traveling pet safety.
</P>
<P>
   House Transportation Chairman Bud Shuster, R-Pa., said the bill,
which increases spending by more than $10 billion over three years,
will address a crisis where ''our air traffic control systems must
be modernized, single airlines have gained monopolistic supremacy
at many of our large airports and flight delays and customer
complaints are increasing.''
</P>
<P>
   The compromise bill, which easily passed the Senate last week,
won wide support among lawmakers recognizing there must be a major
investment to cope with an expected growth in air passengers from
600 million last year to more than 1 billion by the end of the
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said President Clinton
would sign the bill, which he said would ''expand capacity and
improve the efficiency of the system to meet the air travel needs
of the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   But some in Congress grumbled about the sharp increase in
funding, the proposed new flights and the new tax outlined in the
Federal Aviation Administration authorization bill.
</P>
<P>
   Aiming to increase flights to smaller markets, the bill phases
out flight limits at Chicago's O'Hare in 2002 and at New York's
LaGuardia and JFK in 2007. It permits 24 more flights out of
Washington's Reagan National, including 12 beyond the current 1,250
''perimeter rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., a Chicago-area lawmaker who for years
has fought the flight increases, said it would ''help create
massive gridlock and delays at O'Hare and across the nation.'' He
said it was ''only a matter of time before this increased jamming
of flights results in a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers from less populated areas welcomed the change. A
roundtrip ticket from Rochester to Chicago now costs $1,200, said
Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y. ''The major carriers have a
stranglehold on these slots, effectively preventing low-cost
carriers from entering the market.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill allows airports to raise their passenger taxes, or
''passenger facility charges'' from the current ceiling of $3 to
$4.50 a person, a move which could bring in an extra $700 million a
year for local airport projects.
</P>
<P>
   Shuster insisted it was not a new tax because the local airports
had control over whether to impose it. But any association with tax
increases rankled some Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''This legislation runs counter to our most basic principles as
Republicans,'' said Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, who objected to both
the tax and the increase in spending.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, ranking Democrat on the
Appropriations Committee, said Shuster's ability to corral more
money for aviation meant less money for other programs. An extra $1
billion for aviation, he said, means $1 billion less for cancer
research, special education or renovation of schools.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate both passed FAA bills last year, but were
unable to reach a compromise over Shuster's demand that the
Aviation Trust Fund, which takes in some $10 billion a year in user
fees, be separated from the general federal budget and its revenues
be used exclusively for airport projects.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate wouldn't go along but finally agreed to a compromise
where spending on airports every year would at least equal revenues
and interest from the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Also included in the bill are provisions to help airlines buy
regional jets if they agree to use them to serve small airports,
money to improve the training of airport screeners, requirements
for emergency locator devices on small jets and guidelines for air
tours over national parks.	   The Association of Flight Attendants said the bill
was a victory
for their members because it improves protections for
whistleblowers, increases penalties for unruly passengers and
provides a study of cabin air quality.

<HEADLINE> Farm Bankruptcy Provision Opposed  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department says it would be unfair
to let farmers escape paying capital gains taxes when they
reorganize under bankruptcy law.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, a farmer who sells land or equipment has to
pay up front and in full any income taxes that are due on the
proceeds before settling with other creditors. Lawyers say the
resulting taxes often force farmers to liquidate when they might be
able to stay in operation by downsizing.
</P>
<P>
   A provision in a Senate-approved bankruptcy bill would allow
some or all of the taxes to be discharged as an unsecured debt.
</P>
<P>
   But in a letter this week to House and Senate negotiators, the
Justice Department said ''it would be undesirable to begin creating
exceptions for special interest groups.'' The department said the
law requiring taxes to be paid first is ''intended to deter tax
evasion.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would expand a section, known as Chapter 12, of
the bankruptcy code that was created for farmers during an economic
downturn in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's offensive to have the administration dismiss family
farmers in bankruptcy as nothing more than a special interest
group,'' Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost pointless for farmers to sell their property if the
government takes a lot of the proceeds, said Grassley, who
co-sponsored the bill's Chapter 12 provisions with Senate
Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate legislation also would make Chapter 12 a permanent
part of tax law and allow more farms to use it. Unlike Chapter 11
of the bankruptcy code, which applies to corporations, Chapter 12
does not require a farmer to obtain the consent of creditors before
reorganizing.
</P>
<P>
   Chapter 12, which was created in 1986, has twice expired and
been renewed by Congress. It is due to expire June 30 unless
Congress extends it. There have been about 20,000 filings under the
section since it was created.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate negotiators are trying to reconcile the Senate
bill with a House version that would make Chapter 12 permanent but
wouldn't change it.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill is S. 625. The House bill is H.R. 833.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of Women To Gather in NY  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Thousands of women from around the world
are coming to New York in June to assess what governments,
businesses and individuals have done to achieve equality of the
sexes since the U.N. women's conference in Beijing five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Beijing conference -- the largest-ever gathering of women --
brought together 6,000 delegates from 189 countries and about
30,000 activists from grass-roots organizations who took part in a
parallel Non-Governmental (NGO) Forum.
</P>
<P>
   How many people the New York gathering will draw is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are planning for something between 5,000 and 20,000 total,
including the delegations and the NGOs,'' Linda Tarr-Whelan, U.S.
ambassador to the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women, said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates to the meeting -- unofficially known as ''Beijing Plus
Five'' -- will be attending a special session of the U.N. General
Assembly from June 5-9 that will take a critical look at how
governments, the private sector and individuals are tackling the
wide-ranging plan of action adopted in Beijing. A parallel NGO
meeting will start June 2.
</P>
<P>
   The Beijing platform called on governments to revise laws to
ensure women's equal rights and access to credit and employment, to
provide equal education for girls and to ensure the right of women
to decide matters of sexual and reproductive health. It also urged
governments and businesses to put women in top decision-making
positions and called for the elimination of violence against women.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is really about bringing together local and national and
international groups in support of this platform,'' said Ellen
Chesler, coordinator of the host committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our plans include a major celebration of the progress women
have made and also a series of forums ... to mark the progress and
hold governments accountable for the historic commitments they
made,'' said Chesler, a senior fellow at The Open Society
Institute, a foundation started by George Soros.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women have been
debating a declaration, to be adopted at the General Assembly
session, known as ''Women 2000: Gender Equality, Development and
Peace for the 21st Century.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In talking with other delegations there is some real feeling
that we first have to finish the declaration,'' Tarr-Whelan said.
''A lot of heads of state and ministers will make decisions based

<HEADLINE> Politics, plots, subplots -- the St. Paddy's Parade  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- This year, St. Patrick's Day brings more than
the usual legion of bagpipers to Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The 239th annual soiree will feature shamrocks and ''Kiss me,
I'm Irish'' buttons. But the real attractions on Friday are the
political plots and subplots that have added an element of intrigue
to the march.
</P>
<P>
   There's Mayor Rudy, who doesn't like first lady Hillary, and
vice versa. There's the Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization, which
has little use for either one. There's Cardinal John O'Connor, who
loves everybody but seems unlikely to appear.
</P>
<P>
   Definitely missing are Sinn Fein honcho Gerry Adams, who will
spend the day in Washington, and several prominent Democrats, who
opted to stay away from the parade despite the first-ever visit
from putative New Yorker Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It's quite a swing from last year's event, when actress Maureen
O'Hara served as grand marshal for a march that was more
celebration than spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will march up Fifth Avenue for her first time in the
nation's oldest and largest St. Patrick's Day parade, angering
ILGO, which is excluded from the march. Two weeks earlier, the
Democratic U.S. Senate candidate marched in an inclusive Queens
parade -- but that didn't pacify the Irish-gay group.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't matter where else you march, how many times you
march, or what spin you put on marching -- what matters is
integrity,'' ILGO said in a statement, adding that Clinton's
decision to march brought hers into question.
</P>
<P>
   ILGO, banned from marching under its own banner for the 10th
straight year, planned a massive civil disobedience on Friday
morning. The group predicted that 2,000 protesters, including a
contingent from Ireland, would demonstrate on Fifth Avenue about 90
minutes before the official march, which is run by the Ancient
Order of Hibernians.
</P>
<P>
   ILGO somewhat irrationally blames Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for its
continued exclusion from the parade -- not that it bothers the
mayor. As usual, Giuliani will march near the start of the parade;
what's unusual is that he'll do so as Clinton's likely Republican
opponent in the November election.
</P>
<P>
   The parade marks only their second joint public appearance,
following Saturday's Inner Circle show. Don't expect them to march
arm in arm.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Clinton's debut, some prominent New York Democrats will
not accompany her along the parade route -- although none are saying
it's directly related to the ILGO flap. U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer
says he will not march; city Public Advocate Mark Green will be out
of town.
</P>
<P>
   One other major figure may be missing from this year's parade:
80-year-old Cardinal John O'Connor, a fixture at the last 15
parades, is less than 50-50 to appear on the steps of St. Patrick's
Cathedral for the parade.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's health has been failing since he underwent brain
surgery in September 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given his current weakness, it's far from certain that he'll
be there,'' said Joe Zwilling, spokesman for the archdiocese. ''But
the cardinal has surprised us before. I don't want to rule him
out.''

<HEADLINE> Warning Sought on Mutual Fund Taxes  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Have you wondered how big a bite taxes are
taking out of your mutual fund returns? Companies would be required
to provide that information under legislation moving in Congress
and new rules proposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 2{ percent of an average stock fund's return is now
lost to taxes, but many people aren't aware of the bite.
</P>
<P>
   Some people have described it as ''the dirty little secret'' of
the mutual fund industry, SEC Commissioner Norman Johnson noted
Wednesday at a meeting of the market watchdog agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''Taxes are one of the most significant costs of investing in
mutual funds,'' said Arthur Levitt, the SEC's chairman. ''Yet, many
fund investors may not clearly understand the impact of taxes on
their mutual fund investments.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the tax bite on investors varies widely among the
7,000 or so mutual funds in this country, because differences in
fund investment strategies can produce markedly different tax
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Of the estimated $6 trillion that 83 million Americans now have
invested in mutual funds, roughly $3 trillion is in taxable
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC commissioners voted, 4-0, to put out the new proposal
for public comment until June 30.
</P>
<P>
   It would require mutual funds to disclose in prospectuses and
annual reports the estimated one-, five- and 10-year returns after
taxes so that investors can compare different funds. The returns
would have to be shown in two ways: estimated taxes for investors
who sell their fund shares and for those who stay in the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Fund companies currently are required to disclose only returns
before taxes.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, the House Commerce Committee voted
unanimously for a bill directing the SEC to develop final rules on
mutual fund tax disclosure within 18 months. Several sponsors of
the bill said they were pleased the SEC had already begun but that
they wanted to move the measure through the House to ensure the
effort doesn't fall by the wayside.
</P>
<P>
   There is no parallel measure pending in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Investment Company Institute, a group
representing the mutual fund industry, said it supported, in
principle, the SEC's new proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been supportive of the idea of having a form of
disclosure of the tax consequences,'' John Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that some mutual fund companies -- though far from a
majority -- already disclose tax impacts in some form.

Fossils of Tiny Primates Found
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   Anthropologists have discovered fossils from two species of ''teeny, tiny
primates,'' thumb-sized creatures smaller than any other known primate on the
family tree leading to monkeys, apes and humans. The fossilized foot bones, each
about the size of a grain of rice, were sifted from tons of muddy rubbish at a
limestone mine in eastern China. About 45 million years ago, the fragile
primates lived in a rain forest, feeding on insects and sap. Scientists from
Northern Illinois, Northwestern and Beijing's Chinese Academy of Sciences detail
the species in this week's Journal of Human Evolution.

   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Chronic exposure to low-frequency electromagnetic
fields may be responsible for a higher suicide risk among electric utility
workers, according to researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill. While unable to prove that exposure causes suicide, researchers found
electricians for five U.S. power companies had twice the suicide rate and
linemen 1{ times the rate of utility workers not employed in those jobs. The
findings appeared Wednesday in the April issue of Occupational and Environmental
Medicine.

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A jury has ordered Ford Motor Co. to pay nearly $26
million to a man whose Bronco truck rolled over on a freeway in 1996, leaving
him quadriplegic. An Alameda Superior Court jury on Tuesday determined Richard
Raimondi and his wife, Dana, had suffered $52 million in damages. But they
awarded them half that amount after finding Mr. Raimondi shared responsibility
with Ford for the accident. Attorneys for Ford said the company would ask a
judge to set aside or reduce the verdict, and would appeal if their efforts

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica Slayings Shock College  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES HANNAH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   YELLOW SPRINGS, Ohio (AP) -- Word that two of their own had been
slain in Central America left many at Antioch College numb, a
jarring reminder of the dangerous world outside the campus of their
liberal school.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of Emily Howell of Lexington, Ky., and Emily Eagen of
Ann Arbor, Mich., were found Monday along a highway in Costa Rica.
Authorities said the 19-year-old women had been shot to death.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a shock,'' said Jesse Bacon, 22, of Spring Valley,
Wis., his voice breaking. ''I've been thinking about how terrifying
their last moments must have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Howell had been in Costa Rica since January on a
school-sponsored photography project. The program lets student
study on campus one semester and work at an off-campus job or
project the next.
</P>
<P>
   Eagen, who left the school last summer after running out of
tuition money, had been visiting Howell along with a third student,
Shauna Sellers, 20.
</P>
<P>
   Costa Rican police, who believe at least one of the women was
sexually assaulted, said they were searching for a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   About 740 students attend Antioch, known for a progressive
curriculum based in part on promoting social justice,
open-mindedness and eliminating cultural barriers.
</P>
<P>
   ''People who knew the girls very closely are numb,'' said
student Esther Sassaman, 20, of Rochester, N.Y., as she walked
across the grassy center of campus Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Howard, an adviser to both of the slain women, said Howell
was a dedicated student who had worked with migrant workers in
Kentucky on her previous co-op project.
</P>
<P>
   Her skills in Spanish coupled with a growing interest in
photography led her to Costa Rica, where she had been documenting
the people and culture on film.
</P>
<P>
   Eagen was an education major who wanted to teach, Howard said.
On her last co-op project, she worked for an agency that serves the
developmentally disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Two Antioch College officials left for Costa Rica on Wednesday
to help the victims' families and to bring Sellers home. A private
memorial service was scheduled for today.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Ecklund-Leen, Antioch's director of cooperative education,
said Howell knew about possible risks while in Costa Rica but felt
she would be safe.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a very random act. It could have happened in Dayton.
It could have happened in Columbus,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There were no plans to curtail the co-op program.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that it is very important for our students to
become world citizens and to understand what it means to live in a
shrinking world,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> US Warns Ethnic Albanians in Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, reversing course,
is now warning leaders of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo about
cross-border attacks on Serb police.
</P>
<P>
   They ''are in danger of losing our support'' if provocations
continue, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told a
congressional panel Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright blamed persecution of Serbs on extremists and said
it did not compare with the Belgrade-directed ethnic cleansing of
Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would say that the large majority of Kosovar Albanians are
trying to put their life together -- and this is where the
difference is -- after a systematic government-organized pillaging
by the Milosevic Serbs into Kosovo,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic tried ''to kill and
ethnically cleanse the entire Kosovo-Albanian nation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the warning was backed up Wednesday by a raid in eastern
Kosovo in which a senior U.S. official says weapons were seized
from Albanians by U.S. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not believe we are drifting toward a conflict with
Kosovar Albanian insurgents,'' State Department spokesman James P.
Rubin said. ''And we are working to limit the influence of
extremists.''
</P>
<P>
   Albanian attacks on Serb police in Kosovo more than a year ago
prompted Milosevic to crack down fiercely on ethnic Albanians.
Hundreds of thousands were expelled from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   American and NATO bombardment of the Serbs forced Milosevic to
retreat, and the province effectively came under Albanian control.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Rubin delivered a stern message to ethnic Albanian
leaders in an effort to head off any attempt to repeat the scenario
across Kosovo's eastern border in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe they understand the seriousness of the situation and
that we are coming at them as a friend,'' Rubin said in an
interview Wednesday after returning from what will likely be his
last diplomatic mission. ''I hope they will do more to prevent
these things from happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin met with Ibrahim Rugova, the president of Kosovo's largest
political party; Hashim Thaci, the former political leader of
Kosovo's rebels; and others.
</P>
<P>
   While current forays against Serbs in the Presevo Valley are on
a smaller scale than the earlier Albanian provocation in Kosovo,
the violence worries the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are determined to police the border and not allow this kind
of cross-border activity,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Liberation Army, which spearheaded the rebellion
against Belgrade, ''doesn't want a confrontation'' with the
peacekeeping troops, Rubin said. ''They are very careful of this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians have turned in their heavy weapons, but ''there
are more weapons out there that we are still looking for,'' Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day mission to Kosovo was Rubin's second unusual
assignment for a spokesman. Last June, he met with Thachi in
Macedonia, Kosovo and Albania and helped work out an agreement in
which the ethnic Albanians drew back from their demand for a
postwar army.
</P>
<P>
   His regular appearances on television, briefing reporters at the
State Department, made him well-known to the Albanians and he
apparently has built up their trust in him.
</P>
<P>
   On this week's trip, he made stops in Pristina, the provincial
capital; Kosovoska Mitrovica, where violence flared again
Wednesday; and several villages.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were very warm and emotional moments, with people
thanking America for saving them,'' Rubin said. ''It's very
touching when elderly men kiss your hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rubin said he told Albanian leaders they were not doing
enough to promote democracy in Kosovo. They understood that the
message -- and ''a stern message to avoid provocation of the Serbs''
-- came from a friend, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, Air Force spokesman, Lt. Col. Vic Warzinski
said, ''What we are trying to do now is defuse the situation before
it gets out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard N. Haass, director of foreign policy studies at the
Brookings Institution, took a dark view of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We entered Kosovo under the guise of peacemaking, and that
context no longer exists,'' he said in an interview.
''Increasingly, we have to face the challenge of peacemaking, not
peacekeeping.''
</P>
<P>
   Haass said a larger U.S. presence along the border will be
required, ''and giving U.S. troops a more aggressive role to go
after the guerrillas, if need be.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Staffers Cited in IRS Probe  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bipartisan congressional study found no
evidence that conservative groups were audited by the IRS for their
anti-Clinton views, but it did determine that the Clinton
administration tried in two instances to obtain confidential
taxpayer information.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore's office acknowledged making one of the
attempts, although Gore was not identified in the report by the
Joint Committee on Taxation. The other attempt came from the
Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year study was begun after several non-profit
conservative organizations complained they were politically
targeted for audits during the Clinton presidency. The report,
obtained Wednesday, concluded that ''high profile tax-exempt
organizations and individuals'' received increased IRS scrutiny.
But ''no credible evidence'' was discovered that any groups ''were
selected for examination based on the political views.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides tried to obtain information about ''the status of
certain forms filed by members of a tax-exempt organization,'' the
study said. The vice president's staff members first tried to get
the information, which involved a union, from the Treasury
Department. The department directed them to the IRS in violation of
the department's rules, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   ''The White House officials then, in violation of written White
House policies, contacted directly several IRS employees ... and
attempted to secure taxpayer return information,'' the report
alleged.
</P>
<P>
   The White House policy states that ''no member of the White
House staff should have any communication of any type with the IRS
without prior approval of the (White House) counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials contended the officials who made the
contacts were authorized by the counsel's office as required by the
rules and were not seeking tax return information.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears it is a straightforward status check that was
handled appropriately by our office,'' Gore spokeswoman Melissa
Bonney Ratcliff said.
</P>
<P>
   The report did not identify the officials, and also declined to
identify the tax-exempt group because of taxpayer confidentiality
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Officials familiar with the investigation, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said evidence gathered by the committee
suggested Gore's staff made the inquiry because the vice president
was expecting to talk to union officials.
</P>
<P>
   The officials inquired about the status of an IRS decision on a
tax filing over whether certain workers should be classified as
independent contractors or employees for tax purposes, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of the 1995 Treasury inquiry could not be
determined. The report said a department official inquired about
the status of an examination of a tax-exempt organization to
several IRS officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''The IRS employees in question all recognized the impropriety
of the contacts, and made referrals'' to investigators in the
agency, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ''These types of contacts lend credence to the allegations that
the administration does intervene in IRS matters pertaining to
specific taxpayers,'' the report stated.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Department spokeswoman Michelle Smith declined to
comment Wednesday, saying she had not seen the report.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, The Associated Press disclosed that several
members of Congress, including Republicans, had requested audits of
the tax-exempt status of political foes -- based on complaints from
constituents or news stories. Among them was House Ways and Means
Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, who had requested the Joint Taxation
Committee review.
</P>
<P>
   From Jan. 1, 1994, through April 22, 1997, the IRS' national
office received nearly 500 inquiries from lawmakers relating to
tax-exempt organizations, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   While there was no evidence that the inquiries altered the
handling of any audits, the report confirmed that the IRS moved
much faster in handling such requests.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because the funding of IRS operations is dependent on the
Congress, the IRS responds more promptly to, and takes more
seriously, requests and inquiries made by members of Congress than
requests made by taxpayers,'' the report found.
</P>
<P>
   The study warned the congressional requests had ''the potential
for improper influence.''
</P>
<P>
   The joint tax committee is made up of select senators and
representatives on the congressional tax-writing panels and
provides the official estimates of all tax bills for the House and
Senate. It also researches various tax-related topics.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Commuters Search for Cheap Gas  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID PITT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- They're trading in their gas guzzlers for economy
cars. They're driving miles out of their way for cheaper gas
prices. And in some cases, they're not paying at all.
</P>
<P>
   Americans hit with sticker shock at the pumps are finding
solutions -- conventional and unconventional -- to ease the high cost
of filling up their vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just ridiculous,'' said Bob Swift, 32, a stone mason from
Antioch, Calif., who sold two V8 vehicles and bought a Ford Ranger
''in order to get a gas economizer.''
</P>
<P>
   Vivian Martin drives the seven miles from her home in Eufaula,
Ala., to buy gas in Georgia, where she saves 10 to 15 cents per
gallon because of Georgia's lower gasoline tax.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a lot cheaper,'' she said. ''It's not out of your way
when you want to save a little money.''
</P>
<P>
   The AAA Auto Club said its survey of U.S. gas stations released
Tuesday showed that the average price for a gallon of regular
unleaded gas was $1.54. The main cause is OPEC's decision over the
past two years to cut back on production to raise low prices.
</P>
<P>
   While the oil cartel is expected to boost production later this
month, lower prices aren't expected at American pumps for at least
six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta radio station WSTR was overwhelmed last week by the
response to its promotion offering free gas to the first 94
customers at a local Amoco. Within 30 minutes of the announcement,
more than 200 cars were waiting, said Alan Hennes, the radio
station's operations director.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were driving from 10 miles away to get the gas,'' Hennes
said. ''And it was everybody. You had everything from a Pinto to a
Lexus.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Cattaraugus Indian Reservation in New York, gasoline
business has increased 10 percent in the last two weeks. Gas sells
for $1.29 a gallon on the reservation, where vendors pay only the
federal tax on gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've seen a lot of new faces,'' said Morgan Reid, general
manager of JR's, a reservation convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   At Bruce's Mobil in St. Louis County, Mo., customers were
grumbling Wednesday after the station raised the price of a gallon
of unleaded regular to $1.53 from $1.45.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't like it, either,'' manager Keith Steinrauf said.
''It's not us, it's the people that send us the gas. And the more
the price goes up, the less we make.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Harris has a worse problem. As the manager of Bucky's
Amoco in Council Bluffs, Iowa, she said the solution for some
drivers is simply not to pay at all.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're seeing a big problem with drive-offs. People are just
coming in, filling up and driving off,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Winslow, a courier from San Jose, Calif., said he stopped
buying clothes so he could afford to run his classic guzzler, a
1969 Chevrolet Malibu equipped with a new 9.2 liter 350 horsepower
engine.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lately, I've been spending $100 on gas a day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some commuters have even started simply leaving their cars at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Fulton, a spokesman for the Maryland Mass Transit
Administration, said ridership on light rail and commuter buses has
risen between 3 percent and 7 percent since February.
</P>
<P>
   And the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority has
experienced two consecutive months of increased usage. Spokesman
Bobby Harper said ridership was up 2.7 percent in January from the
same month a year ago and February figures indicate a 3.2 percent
increase.
</P>
<P>
   ''Two months back to back certainly indicates something is going
on,'' he said. ''You can assume some of those people are saying,
'I'm just going to save some money by taking the train.'''

<HEADLINE> Bush, Gore Going After Each Other  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- George W. Bush and Al Gore started going
after each other even before they locked up their parties'
presidential nominations. With that fight now settled, they have
less than eight months until the November election to drive home
their points.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the likely themes:
</P>
<P>
   -- TRUTHFULNESS: Republican Bush is already going after his
Democratic rival on the issue, telling audiences that Gore will
''say anything'' to get elected. Among the Bush campaign's fodder
are the vice president's suggestions that he invented the Internet,
brought attention to the toxic contamination of Love Canal and that
he and wife Tipper were the inspiration for ''Love Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Another point is Gore's pledge to make campaign financing a
cornerstone of his campaign. Gore says he's learned from his
fund-raising problems during the 1996 re-election campaign,
including raising money at a Buddhist temple, an episode Bush now
refers to often. A Gore friend and fund-raiser recently was
convicted of fund-raising improprieties, including matters related
to the temple event.
</P>
<P>
   -- RIGHT WING: Gore contends that Bush is a right-wing extremist
and uses such phrases as ''risky tax scheme'' and ''extreme right
wing'' to describe the Texas governor and his proposals in a rerun
of some of the plays he and President Clinton used to trounce Bob
Dole in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich may be long gone from the House speaker's chair,
but his name still pops up in Gore's speeches when he says Bush's
proposed five-year, $483 billion tax-cut plan is bigger even than
what Gingrich and ''that gang'' of Republicans had offered.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also invokes the Christian right when noting Bush's
opposition to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Other fodder for Gore is Bush's reluctance to criticize the
National Rifle Association after its executive vice president
asserted this week that Clinton exploits gun deaths for political
gain. Bush said certain motives shouldn't be ascribed to the
president and appealed for an end to name-calling, but he did not
criticize the NRA for the comments.
</P>
<P>
   -- EDUCATION: Bush is running on his education record in Texas
and, after securing the GOP nomination Tuesday night, attacked Gore
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wants to strengthen accountability by supporting local
testing of students and by threatening to yank federal money from
schools that perform poorly. He contends Gore simply promises more
schools and more teachers without addressing the core educational
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a bright and dividing line in this campaign,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   One cautionary note already being played up by Gore: Exit polls
show that about four in 10 Republican voters in Texas believe there
have not been ''significant reforms'' in state schools under Bush,
now in his second term as governor. The same polls show that more
than six in 10 Democratic voters agreed the schools have not been
significantly reformed under Bush.
</P>
<P>
   -- EXPERIENCE: Gore, who is in his eighth year as Clinton's vice
president, argues that his rival doesn't have enough experience to
be president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also has switched from linking Bush's ''risky tax scheme''
to the Reagan-Bush years, connecting it to the ''Bush-Quayle''
years instead. Gore says he simply wants to ''refer to the most
recent experience,'' but introducing former Vice President Dan
Quayle's name is not accidental, as Gore tries to stoke whatever
public perception is out there that Bush is a lightweight.
</P>
<P>
   ''Does Governor Bush have the experience to be president?'' Gore
asked Wednesday night at a rally in Moon Township, Pa. ''No,'' the
crowd screamed back.
</P>
<P>
   A continuing vulnerability for Gore, however, is public unease
about his ties to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A recent ABC News-Washington Post poll showed people evenly
split on the question of whether Gore is too close to Clinton to
provide the fresh start the country appears to be seeking.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been working hard to establish himself as an individual
separate from Clinton, but Bush has taken to referring to the
''Clinton-Gore'' administration at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   -- OTHER ISSUES: Besides attacking Gore on education and
trustworthiness, Bush plans to hit the vice president for failing
to support personal savings accounts as an alternative to Social
Security. He also plans to argue that Gore is weak on health care
because more Americans are uninsured today than when Clinton-Gore
took office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   A final line of attack by Gore is to portray Bush as a puppet of
the campaign contributors who helped him set a new fund-raising
record by hauling in $73 million for the campaign. The vice
president also cites Bush's friendships within Texas industries as
reasons why the state leads the nation in pollution and why Bush
cannot be trusted to pursue a balanced energy policy.

<HEADLINE> Spat Puts Spotlight on House Race  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER LOVEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RANTOUL, Ill. (AP) -- Tom Ewing wants to see his son follow in
his footsteps -- right to his seat in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But Sam Ewing is a political novice who works for an insurance
company, and nearly all the elder Ewing has gained so far is an
ugly public spat with one of his oldest and closest allies, House
Speaker Dennis Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert has endorsed one of Sam Ewing's rivals in Illinois'
March 21 primary. The speaker called three-term state Rep. Bill
Brady a better bet for Republicans trying to retain control of the
House in the fall election.
</P>
<P>
   The feud has put a national spotlight on a race that would have
been ignored outside the largely rural eastern Illinois district,
where most consider the front-runner to be a third candidate,
veteran state Rep. Tim Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   He is a tireless campaigner who has never been defeated. But
Johnson's lucrative trial law practice and his three divorces make
some conservatives nervous.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP tension began when Tom Ewing appeared to delay
announcing his retirement until after his son had moved back from
Texas. Some saw Ewing's retirement as an annoying distraction for
the party -- and Hastert. And they resented Sam Ewing's
unwillingness to run for a lower office first.
</P>
<P>
   Tongues also wagged at Hastert's decision to get involved when
the district isn't deemed crucial to the GOP's bid to at least hold
their 11-seat House majority. The elder Ewing is one of 23
Republicans retiring this year, compared with only seven Democrats,
and a Democrat hasn't won in his district since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, two Democrats are competing for the party's
nomination: Laurel Prussing, a former state representative who ran
twice against the elder Ewing, and Mike Kelleher, a former
congressional aide.
</P>
<P>
   While the Hastert-Ewing tiff has been the subject of gossip
within the local party establishment and second-guessing by
Washington insiders, it doesn't appear to be weighing heavily on
voters' minds.
</P>
<P>
   ''It might make a difference to some, but for John Q. Citizen --
I don't think that it matters much,'' said Glenn Stanko, a
Republican running for circuit judge in Champaign. ''It has caused
some hard feelings, but that's normal I guess for a primary.''
</P>
<P>
   The race will probably not be decided by money, though Johnson
had spent the most with three weeks left. The Republicans --
including Jeffrey Jones, a dentist new to politics -- have personal
resources they are willing to use.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates also differ little on the issues, staking out
mostly conservative positions similar to those of the elder Ewing.
They are against abortion and for smaller government, lower taxes,
help for farmers and high-tech development.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, 29, whose family owns several large farming operations,
touts his familiarity with agricultural and rural issues. He says
his success as a disaster team manager for State Farm Insurance Co.
has provided great training for representative politics.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he's also hoping to capitalize on his father's
popularity while persuading voters he's able himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''Being Tom Ewing's son is a huge asset for me,'' he said to
diners in Watseka, near the Indiana line. ''But it just gets my
foot in the door. ... I didn't expect this to be handed to me.''

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Says He's the True Reformer  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pat Buchanan says it will take a third-party
candidate like himself to reform campaign finance laws because
Republicans and Democrats are ''chemically dependent'' on political
donations.
</P>
<P>
   The latest presidential hopeful to call himself the race's true
reformer, Buchanan says, ''Neither Beltway party is going to drain
this swamp, because to them it is not a swamp at all, but a
protected wetland and their natural habitat. They swim in it, feed
in it, spawn in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks were prepared for delivery today in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The two-time Republican presidential candidate is seeking the
Reform Party nomination. A former aide to Presidents Nixon and
Reagan, Buchanan ranks well behind the presumptive major-party
nominees -- Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush -- in
national polls.
</P>
<P>
   His speech comes amid a frenzy of activity by both Gore and
Bush, the nominees-in-waiting, to portray themselves as political
reformers in hopes of attracting the voters who flocked to GOP
primaries in support of failed Republican candidate John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   He said Bush, Gore, McCain and failed Democratic candidate Bill
Bradley are all guilty of fund-raising excesses.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to fund-raising calls Gore made from the White House
in 1996, Buchanan said, ''Where was his conscience? Where was his
sense of respect for the White House?''
</P>
<P>
   He accused Bush of shying away from campaign finance reform out
of fear that changes would hurt the GOP. ''The true test of who is
a reformer is results,'' Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said. On
education and health care, ''Governor Bush has taken on the special
interests'' in Texas, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said that if Gore is part of a
Washington swamp Buchanan ''is the candidate of the dark lagoon:
Anti-choice, anti-gun reform, anti-mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining the battle of self-styled reformers, Buchanan said as
president he would seek to:
</P>
<P>
   -- Ban unlimited, unregulated donations from corporations or
unions. Bush has made a similar proposal. Gore, like McCain, says
he would extend the ban to individual ''soft money'' contributions.
''The Beltway parties are chemically dependent on soft money,''
Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   -- Require congressmen to raise half of their donations from
their home states or districts.
</P>
<P>
   -- Increase the limit on individual contributions to candidates
from $1,000 to $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   -- Pass a law giving states the power to impose congressional
term limits and restrict the Supreme Court's right to reverse the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   -- End the congressional pension plan.
</P>
<P>
   -- Make it easier for third-party candidates to get on ballots.
</P>
<P>
   -- Allow people to register and vote on the same day.

<HEADLINE> Bush Releases Overnight Guests List  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an attempt to quiet criticism over his
choice of guests, George W. Bush's campaign has identified everyone
who has slept over at the Governor's Mansion in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush released the list Wednesday after the watchdog Center for
Public Integrity released a separate study saying that 60 of the
131 guests had contributed or raised more than $2.2 million for
Bush's presidential campaign. Bush has raised a record $73 million
for the White House bid.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, Bush's Democratic opponent, also has
criticized the sleepovers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's another concern about campaign fund-raising practices
that George Bush needs to address,'' Gore spokesman Douglas
Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign officials said the governor had opened the mansion
to relatives, longtime friends and Republican officials, not
fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Friends and family are always welcome in Governor and Mrs.
Bush's home,'' spokeswoman Karen Hughes said. ''They were welcome
in his home before he was governor, they are welcome in his home
while he is governor and they will be welcome in his home after he
is governor.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Center for Public Integrity noted that individuals who
would play a key role in the presidential campaign began visiting
the mansion beginning in 1997. Early guests included former
Christian Coalition executive director Ralph Reed; New York Gov.
George Pataki, who helped deliver his state to Bush in the March 7
primary; and former Rep. Tom Tauke of Iowa, now the chief
Washington lobbyist for Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported this month that eight of Bush's 31
overnight guests since January 1999 were fund-raisers for the
campaign. One was Don Evans, his national finance chairman. The
other seven had raised at least $100,000 apiece -- fund-raisers Bush
has dubbed ''pioneers.''
</P>
<P>
   After the AP report, Bush released a list of the eight people in
question, noting that all were friends or relatives. At the time,
former presidential rival John McCain compared the practice to
President Clinton's use of the Lincoln Bedroom to reward big
Democratic donors.
</P>
<P>
   The list Bush released Wednesday dates to January 1995, when he
became governor.

<HEADLINE> Kings 98, Clippers 78  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Chris Webber scored 25 points and had
eight rebounds Wednesday night as the Sacramento Kings cruised past
the Los Angeles Clippers 98-78.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento outscored the Clippers 28-14 in the second quarter,
led by 22 points at the half and never let the margin slip under 18
in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Despite missing the entire fourth quarter, Vlade Divac scored 12
points and had 15 rebounds for the Kings, who won for the fifth
time in seven games. Predrag Stojakovic made two 3-pointers and
scored 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Lamar Odom had his third triple-double of the year,
getting 21 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists for the Clippers, who
have lost 31 of their last 36 games. Michael Olowokandi had 16
points and 14 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead by 20 points, the Kings opened the fourth quarter with six
straight points. Jon Barry made a 3-pointer, giving the Kings an
80-54 lead with 10:20 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Webber scored eight points in the third quarter, including
consecutive dunks as Sacramento built the lead to 24 at one stretch
and was ahead 74-54 heading into the fourth period.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead by four points midway through the second quarter,
Sacramento outscored the Clippers 22-4 over the final 6:21,
assuming a 55-33 lead by halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Webber had 12 of his 17 first-half points in the second quarter.

<HEADLINE> Blues 5, Coyotes 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Chris Pronger scored a pair of power-play goals
and the St. Louis Blues beat the Phoenix Coyotes 5-3 Wednesday
night, matching a franchise mark for road wins.
</P>
<P>
   Pascal Rheaume, Dave Ellett and Scott Young also scored for the
Blues, who moved four points ahead of idle Detroit for the Central
Division lead. St. Louis won for the 11th time in 13 road games
(11-1-1) to raise its NHL-best road record to 23-9-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues equaled the team record for road victories set by the
1990-91 club and are one point away from setting the franchise mark
for road points.
</P>
<P>
   Roman Turek, 19-4-4 in his last 27 games, made 28 saves and ran
his scoreless streak against the Coyotes to 180 minutes, one second
before Keith Carney scored at 2:50 of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Doan and Greg Adams also scored for the Coyotes, who lost
their second straight and fell 11 points behind Pacific-Division
leading Dallas with 12 games remaining. Phoenix is two points ahead
of Edmonton for sixth place in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Rheaume, recalled from Worcester of the AHL on Tuesday, took
advantage of a mental mistake by Phoenix goalie Sean Burke to score
his first regular-season goal since Feb. 28, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Burke went behind his net to play the puck after it was dumped
into the zone by the Blues. As he debated whether to pass the puck
out front or give it to a teammate standing by his side, Jochen
Hecht skated in from behind and poked the puck to Rheaume, who
scored into the vacated net.
</P>
<P>
   Ellett made it 2-0 at 17:34 of the second, taking a back-handed
pass from Pavel Demitra and flipping the puck over Burke's shoulder
for his second goal, and first since Feb. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Pronger extended the Blues' lead to 3-0 with a blast between
Burke's pads, from the top of the left faceoff circle, 41 seconds
into the third.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues are 40-0 this season when they score three or more
goals and have won 51 straight going back to last season.
</P>
<P>
   Carney pulled the Coyotes within two when he gathered in a long
rebound in the middle of the left faceoff circle and beat Turek
with a wrist shot.
</P>
<P>
   Pronger and Young scored 31 seconds apart midway through the
final period to give St. Louis a 5-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Doan batted a loose puck near his waist past Turek at 9:51 to
cut the lead to 5-2. Referee Lance Roberts determined, after
viewing a replay, that Doan did not hit the puck with a high stick.
</P>
<P>
   Burke was then pulled for Bob Essensa.
</P>
<P>
   Adams added a power-play goal with 1:30 remaining, tucking the
puck behind Turek from behind the net as the goalie moved out of
the crease.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Bryan Smolinski had his second two-goal
game of the season as the Los Angeles Kings rallied from two goals
down to tie the Anaheim Mighty Ducks 2-2 on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Storr stopped the last 34 shots he faced -- three during a
power play in overtime -- and finished with 37 saves to help extend
the Kings' unbeaten streak to four games.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Rucchin and Oleg Tverdovsky scored less than five minutes
apart on Anaheim's first two power plays of the game. Goalie Guy
Hebert made 20 saves and extended his unbeaten streak against the
Kings to 6-0-2.
</P>
<P>
   This was be the 10th time the Ducks and Kings have played
overtime in their 7-year-old series, with the Kings holding a 3-1-6
advantage. They have three more meetings scheduled with Anaheim
during the final three weeks of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings began their comeback just 47 seconds after Tverdovsky
increased Anaheim's lead to 2-0. Nelson Emerson, playing his first
game since being acquired from Atlanta, pinched along the right
boards to keep the puck in the Anaheim zone and fed it behind the
net to Glen Murray, whose centering pass found Smolinski at the
edge of the crease at 9:40 of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Smolinski, whose entire offensive contribution during the Kings'
previous 13 games consisted of an empty-net goal, tied the score 59
seconds into the second period as he beat Hebert through the pads
with a 35-foot slap shot for his 20th of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Smolinski also had two goals on Jan. 13 in a 3-2 loss to St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks, 18th on power-play conversions, scored on two of
their first three shots against Storr, who had allowed only six
goals on 103 shots in his previous four starts.
</P>
<P>
   After Dan Bylsma was sent off for holding Paul Kariya, Fredrik
Olausson played the puck off the right boards and sent a soft shot
toward the net that Rucchin redirected past Storr at the 4:02 mark
for his 100th NHL goal and 16th of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Tverdovsky got his 13th goal just 19 seconds after Ian
Laperriere went to the penalty box for elbowing Jeff Nielsen. The
Ducks' defenseman was 15 feet from Storr in the left circle when he
converted Teemu Selanne's pass from behind the net.

   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Jeff Friesen's goal with 2:04 left in
overtime Wednesday night gave the San Jose Sharks a
come-from-behind 6-5 victory over the Buffalo Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose's Vincent Damphousse scored with just 28 seconds left
in regulation to lift the Sharks into a tie. Then Friesen's shot in
overtime from about eight feet deflected off Dominik Hasek and into
the right corner of the net.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres took a 5-3 lead on third-period goals by James
Patrick, 59 seconds in, and Curtis Brown at 8:48. San Jose's Tony
Granato scored exactly three minutes after Brown on a driving,
off-balance shot from 12 feet to cut the Sabres' lead to 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Damphousse then scored his 19th goal, assisted by Niklas
Sundstrom.
</P>
<P>
   An interesting first period was highlighted by two San Jose
short-handed scored within 1:09. Buffalo answered with two goals --
one on the power play -- in a period of just nine seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Owen Nolan got his 42nd goal for the Sharks from the right
circle at 5:23. Marco Sturm followed at 6:32 with a shot from
point-blank range that sneaked between Hasek's legs.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo came back less than five minutes later. Doug Gilmour got
his 23rd goal from the right circle at 11:08, as Sharks goalie
Steve Shields appeared to be screened. Following the ensuing
faceoff, Geoff Sanderson drove for a goal at 11:17.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres record for fastest two goals is four seconds, set
Oct. 17, 1974 when Lee Fogolin and Don Luce scored against
California.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo took a 3-2 lead 41 seconds into the second when Vladimir
Tsyplakov scored on a 15-foot shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks tied it with 4:02 left in the period when Alexander
Korolyuk scored on a slap shot from the top of the left circle.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose is 3-0-1 in four games and 4-1-1 in six.

<HEADLINE> First Dog Death in 2000 Iditarod  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- As mushers continued to stream into
Nome, a dog belonging to Michigan musher Al Hardman died Wednesday
in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, according to a race official.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first dog death of the 1,100-mile race this year.
</P>
<P>
   Race marshal Mark Nordman told radio station KNOM that the dog
died on the trail between Koyuk and Elim. A necropsy was ordered
for the animal and Hardman was allowed to continue in the race,
according to KNOM.
</P>
<P>
   Hardman was in 36th place Wednesday night. As of 9 p.m., 24
mushers had crossed the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Doug Swingley of Lincoln, Mont., claimed his
third Iditarod victory Tuesday morning. He finished in a record 9
days and 58 minutes to best his own 1995 record of 9 days, 2 hours
and 42 minutes. Ramy Brooks of Healy crossed the finish line about
five hours later to claim second place.
</P>
<P>
   A record 81 teams began the race, which had its ceremonial start
in Anchorage on March 4. By 9 p.m. Wednesday, 45 teams remained on
the trail.

<HEADLINE> Teacher Calls Govs. Bush Racists  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN, AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- At an Education Department seminar on
promoting diversity, a former teacher described Govs. George W. and
Jeb Bush as racists, department officials have acknowledged. At
least one House lawmaker wants an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Elliot, an author who delivers lectures worldwide on race
and bias issues, was invited to the department March 8 to deliver a
presentation on how children become prejudiced.
</P>
<P>
   During the presentation, she also advised about 50 employees who
attended not to vote for Republican political candidates,
department officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Bushes are Republicans. George W. Bush is the governor of
Texas and a candidate for president. His brother, Jeb, is governor
of Florida. Their father is former President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Erica Lepping, a spokeswoman for Education Secretary Richard
Riley, said Wednesday that the context of Elliot's remarks about
the Bush brothers and GOP candidates was unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had no reason to believe Ms. Elliot's presentation would
end up with her saying the things she did,'' Lepping said. ''The
comments were spontaneous and unanticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   Lepping, who did not attend the meeting, said Leslie Thornton,
the department's chief of staff, immediately sent an e-mail memo to
staffers denouncing Elliot's political statements as ''comments
that were inappropriate in an address to federal employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliot could not be reached for comment Wednesday. She is a
former third-grade teacher from Iowa and creator of a well-known
diversity lesson that separates students based on eye color.
</P>
<P>
   Elliot received about $7,500 from the department for
participating in its speaker's series on diversity, Lepping said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We certainly don't endorse the comments and they don't reflect
our views,'' said Lepping.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Mich., a member of the House Education and
Workforce Committee, criticized the seminar as another example of
mismanagement at the department. He said Wednesday he had sent the
department a letter seeking more details on Elliot's talk.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want a full explanation from the department about this
seminar and what they are doing to ensure that this sort of thing
does not happen again,'' Hoekstra said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment from representatives of George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Sayfie, a spokesman for Jeb Bush, said the governor's
''record on diversity and inclusion in office speaks for itself. As
far as the specific allegation, if it actually took place, it is
absurd.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Brings Pa. Different Messages  </HEADLINE>
By TODD SPANGLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORAOPOLIS, Pa. (AP) -- Abandoning talk of gun control, Vice
President Al Gore touted himself as a friend of unions, families
and working class Americans at a suburban Pittsburgh high school --
and criticized his likely Republican rival, Texas Gov. George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, on the other side of the state, he talked
about his proposals for gun control -- a theme not discussed later
in more conservative western Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   At a standing-room only rally at Moon Area High School, Gore
tried to sell his family-man credentials, mentioning his infant
grandson and the fact that he and Tipper Gore will celebrate their
30th wedding anniversary in May.
</P>
<P>
   He also reminded the crowd of his status as a Vietnam veteran
and presented himself as a friend of the working class who will
strive to pass universal health care for children and strengthen
unions.
</P>
<P>
   He received a huge cheer from the crowd of working-class parents
and teen-agers when he spoke of his plans to raise the minimum wage
by $1 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   While making no mention of Bush at a high school earlier in the
day in Philadelphia, in the eastern part of the state, Gore
mentioned the Texas governor's father, former President Bush, in
suggesting that working people don't want to return to the policies
of the ''Bush-Quayle'' years.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we went back to the old Bush-Quayle approach and built up
the debt again, we would set this whole country back for a long
ways,'' Gore said. ''You felt the effects of what happened then.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he criticized his Republican rival for planning a
$483 billion, five-year tax cut and for proposing to privatize
parts of Medicare and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we went down that road, we'd end up with a two-tiered
system: One for the wealthy and one for the rest,'' said Gore, who
clinched the Democratic nomination for president Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, in Philadelphia, Gore promised to boost federal
education spending by half, ''but keep control at the local
level.'' He also said better parenting is key to reducing school
violence.
</P>
<P>
   It was in this city that Gore laid out his education and gun
control proposals before several hundred cheering students at the
Dobbins/Randolph Area Vocational Technical High School.
</P>
<P>
   Among other proposals, he called for $10,000 signing bonuses to
recruit mid-career teachers from other professions, additional
special education funding, mandatory testing of new teachers and
renovated school buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said school violence is going down, ''but the horrific
examples of violence are getting worse.'' He said parents need to
spend more time with their children.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of parents are stressed out, exhausted, working so hard
that when they get home at night they hardly have time to do
anything except turn on the television,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   He also repeated his call for mandatory trigger locks on guns
and also proposed more school counselors and psychologists, metal
detectors for schools that want them and reduced class sizes. He
also chastised Hollywood for the violence in its movies, films and
music.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have got to do something to get more voluntary
self-restraint in the entertainment media of this country because
of the excessive incidents of violence being showered onto the
heads of our young people,'' Gore said.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Slips, Japan Stocks Rebound  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices rebounded Thursday as traders
looked for bargains in technology stocks and other issues sold
heavily in recent sessions. The dollar fell against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 105.72 yen in early afternoon trading, down
0.34 yen from late Wednesday but above its overnight level of
105.57 yen late in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 174.63, or
0.92 percent, to 19,253.23. On Wednesday, the average closed down
63.24 points, or 0.33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Toyko currency dealings, the dollar slipped as domestic
investors and exporters converted their overseas assets into yen
ahead of the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31.
</P>
<P>
   ''Repatriation will create a glut of dollars,'' said Shuji
Takano, assistant manager of foreign exchange at ABN AMRO Bank.
''It's getting harder for the dollar to stay above 105 yen.''
</P>
<P>
   The market shrugged off threats by government officials to
intensify their campaign to weaken the yen.
</P>
<P>
   Traders estimated Japan's central bank on Wednesday bought as
much as dlrs 3 billion in an attempt to bring down the yen -- its
second intervention in a week.
</P>
<P>
   Zembei Mizoguchi, the head of the international bureau at
Japan's Finance Ministry, said Thursday that the ministry would
take ''appropriate measures'' if needed to counter a sudden rise by
the yen.
</P>
<P>
   A rising yen cuts into the value of Japanese exporters' earnings
in dollars, and in some cases makes their products more expensive
for overseas customers.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro traded at 102.42 yen, down
marginally from 102.46 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index rebounded midway through
the session.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street provided some encouragement. In New York overnight,
the Dow Jones industrials soared 320.17 points, or 3.3 percent, to
10,131.41.
</P>
<P>
   But the technology-rich Nasdaq composite index remained a
concern. It dropped 124.01 points on Wednesday to end at 4,582.62,
bringing its loss for the past three days to 9.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets in Japan will be closed Monday for a national
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section closed up 40.14 points, or 2.5 percent, at 1,654.47.
The TOPIX closed up 23.46 points, or 1.41 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose
to 1.8300 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.8100 percent. Its
price fell 0.17 points to 99.74.

<HEADLINE> Grand Jury Indicts Man Using DNA  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Police may not know the name of the East Side
rapist, what he looks like or where to find him. But they say they
have his genetic profile and have indicted him for three attacks.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said the indictment was
filed four days before the five-year statute of limitations lapsed
for the first attack.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau said the rapist has attacked at least 16 women, the
last on Sept. 15, 1998. The indictment cites two rapes in 1995 and
another in 1997, but Morgenthau said the rapist's DNA was collected
at four rape sites and he expects at least one more charge will be
filed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although this is New York state's first grand jury indictment
of a 'John Doe' identified by DNA, I am certain it will not be the
last,'' he said Wednesday. He said his office is reviewing hundreds
of open cases that DNA technology might help solve.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Thompson, Morgenthau's spokeswoman, said she knew of two
states, Wisconsin and Utah, in which the DNA profile of a ''John
Doe'' was used to get arrest warrants. She said she knows of no
state other than New York in which a DNA profile has been used to
obtain an indictment.
</P>
<P>
   A ''John Doe'' indictment is legal if it contains a sufficient
description of the suspect, said H. Richard Uviller, a Columbia
University Law School professor.
</P>
<P>
   ''DNA certainly fits that bill,'' Uviller said about the
''genetic fingerprint,'' as it is called. ''You can change your
name, physical features, but you can't change your DNA.''

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Killer To Be Executed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) -- A court on Thursday sentenced Javed
Iqbal to death in the country's worst serial killing, saying he
would be strangled in front of the parents whose children he was
convicted of murdering.
</P>
<P>
   Iqbal was sentenced to be publicly executed in a Lahore park for
killing as many as 100 children. He can appeal his conviction and
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   After he is strangled, Judge Allah Baksh Ranja said Iqbal's body
''will then be cut into a 100 pieces and put in acid the same way
you killed the children.'' Iqbal told the court he was innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Three accomplices, including a 13-year-old boy identified only
as Sabir, also were found guilty. Sabir was sentenced to 42 years
in jail, and the two other accomplices were sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   Iqbal initially confessed to the killings in a letter last year
to police. He said he strangled the children, dismembered their
bodies and placed them in a vat of acid. He later recanted his
confession.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to police, Iqbal directed officials to his home,
where they found a blue vat in which the remains of two bodies were
found. Police also found pictures of 100 children whom Iqbal in his
letter confessed to having killed. They also found clothes
belonging to the young victims.
</P>
<P>
   Parents of missing children were contacted, and they waded
through clothes and pictures to try to identify their missing
children. Most were identified, however police did not recover any
more bodies.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Iqbal walked into the Lahore office of a leading
newspaper and turned himself in. He refused to go directly to the
police saying he feared for his life.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the children were among the city's poorest. Some were
beggars, others were among those who sold goods on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to police, Iqbal said he killed the children in
retaliation for police abuse. He said he had been wrongly picked up
and badly beaten while in police custody.
</P>
<P>
   The search for Iqbal was one of the largest manhunts in
Pakistan, where serial killings are rare. Dozens of people were
picked up and questioned, including several of his relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the trial, parents of the missing children gathered
outside the courtroom, calling for the death sentence.

<HEADLINE> GOP To Field New Kennedy Challenger  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Sen. Edward M. Kennedy has lost one likely
Republican opponent, but apparently gained another one: a
39-year-old business executive with no political experience, but $1
million of his own money to spend on the race.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Jack E. Robinson III, a former Eastern Airlines
executive now running a cellular phone firm, will run this fall for
the seat that Kennedy has held for 37 years, said Plymouth County
District Attorney Michael Sullivan, who is bowing out after a
six-month exploratory campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to be running for the United States Senate,''
Sullivan told The Associated Press early today, citing several
reasons, including a distaste for fund-raising, satisfaction with
his current job and his desire to spend time with his four
school-age children.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just wasn't ready to give up my season tickets to our four
children,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said he understood that Robinson would run in his
place, though he did not know when a formal announcement would be
made. ''It's my understanding he has plans to run for United States
Senate,'' Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Herald reported that Robinson would announce his
plans today.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson could not be reached for comment Wednesday evening. He
has a home in Greenwich, Conn., and has not lived full time in
Massachusetts for many years. But voting records list his address
at his family's Jamaica Plain home.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson met with Republican Gov. Paul Cellucci this week to
discuss his candidacy, and said he was prepared to spend up to $1
million of his personal fortune to do it, The Boston Globe and
Herald reported today.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who is black, is the son of Jack E. Robinson. The
elder Robinson once led the local branch of the NAACP, but was
forced out in 1995 for opposing affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Sources described the younger Robinson as fiscally conservative,
but socially moderate and a supporter of abortion rights. He earned
an undergraduate degree from Brown University, and law and business
degrees from Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Currently president and CEO of Cellular One Caribbean, he once
served as vice president of corporate development for Eastern
Airlines. He also worked as an executive for Continental Airlines.

<HEADLINE> Vt. House Advances Gay Rights Bill  </HEADLINE>
By ROSS SNEYD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- The Vermont House has moved within a key
vote of backing a bill that would grant homosexuals the benefits of
marriage through civil unions.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 79-68 on Wednesday to advance the bill. A final
vote was expected today.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issue before us does arouse deep emotion and that's
because there have been years upon years, decades upon decades of
mistreatment, discrimination and prejudice against one particular
group in our society and that group being gay men and lesbians,''
Rep. William Lippert said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters in the Senate said they have enough votes for passage
there. Both houses are controlled by Democrats and Gov. Howard
Dean, also a Democrat, supports the civil unions bill.
</P>
<P>
   Spectators, some wearing pink badges for the bill and others
wearing white badges against it, packed the House for Wednesday's
debate. The measure was introduced in response to a state Supreme
Court ruling that gays in Vermont were unconstitutionally denied
the rights and benefits of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Both supporters and opponents say the bill would provide more
benefits for same-sex couples than any other state.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, gays could be joined by civil unions just as
heterosexual couples can marry. They would seek licenses from town
clerks and their unions would be solemnized by justices of the
peace, judges or clergy. They would have the right to dissolve
their civil unions through divorces in Family Court.
</P>
<P>
   The state Supreme Court said lawmakers could either amend the
marriage statutes or create a domestic partnership alternative to
bring state law into compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Many have argued that the decision should be made by public
referendum, not by legislators or justices. But Vermont doesn't
have a simple system for amending its constitution, nor does it
have a mechanism for a public referendum.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 states and the federal government have passed laws
denying recognition to same-sex marriages. Californians last week
approved a ballot measure that prohibits the state from recognizing
such marriages legally performed in another state. West Virginia is
expected to soon pass a law doing the same thing.

<HEADLINE> Former Jaycees head wanted on sexual assault charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIDDLETOWN, Conn. (AP) -- A man who resigned as president of the
Greater Hartford Jaycees last week after registering with police as
a convicted sex offender will be charged with new counts of sexual
assault and kidnapping, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert L. Walker, 31, is accused of repeatedly raping his
ex-girlfriend after they broke up, The Hartford Courant reported
today, citing police sources it did not identify.
</P>
<P>
   A Superior Court judge signed an arrest warrant March 9, the day
after Walker resigned from the community service organization best
known for running the Canon Greater Hartford Open golf tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Walker will be charged with four counts of aggravated sexual
assault in the first degree, three counts of aggravated kidnapping
in the first degree, four counts of first-degree sexual assault,
two counts of first-degree kidnapping and threatening.
</P>
<P>
   He allegedly displayed a gun or threatened the use of a weapon,
police sources said, which accounts for the aggravated assault and
kidnapping charges.
</P>
<P>
   When he resigned last week, Walker said he stepped down because
he didn't want media attention to reflect badly on the Jaycees, a
national organization for professionals aged 21 to 39.
</P>
<P>
   Walker has been known to Jaycees as a gifted public speaker and
dedicated leader and was named outstanding local vice president at
last year's national convention.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected president of the 650-member Greater Hartford
chapter in an uncontested race in March 1999 and began his term
Jan. 1 -- becoming chief executive officer of the organization and
its $1 million operating budget.
</P>
<P>
   Walker's leadership was soon called into question when, on Feb.
24, he registered as a convicted sex offender after being contacted
by state police.
</P>
<P>
   Jaycees officials, who knew Walker had a criminal history, did
not know he had been sentenced to nine years in prison in
connection with a March 1989 sexual assault on a flight attendant
at the Ramada Inn near Bradley International Airport.

<HEADLINE> Japan To Hasten Pollution Solutions  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Seeking to remove an irritant in U.S.-Japan
relations, the Japanese government said today it will expedite a
solution to air pollution around an air base where 3,000 U.S.
servicemen and their families live.
</P>
<P>
   The government also pledged to provide temporary off-base
housing to as many as request it while steps are taken to reduce
the level of toxic emissions from the Shinkampo incinerator, a
privately owned plant that sits just outside the gate of Atsugi
Naval Air Facility, about 25 miles west of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Navy has complained about the pollution for more than
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   To announce the new arrangement, Tsutomu Kawara, chief of the
Japan Defense Agency, read a prepared statement to reporters in
which he said the government agrees that air pollution surrounding
Atsugi is ''a problem affecting the health'' of American as well as
Japanese residents in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Kawara nor U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, who
appeared with his Japanese counterpart to announce the deal, would
take questions from reporters. Cohen thanked Kawara and Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi for their personal involvement, and he
lavished praise on the new arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are most appreciative,'' Cohen said. ''This is something
that affects the health and welfare and well-being of not only
American citizens who are at Atsugi but also of Japanese
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen later paid a courtesy call on the prime minister at his
official residence.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to meeting with Kawara to go over details of the
agreement, Cohen was driven to Atsugi and given a first-hand look
at the plume of emissions from the incinerator. During much of the
year, winds drive the plume -- which contains relatively high levels
of dioxin -- directly into Atsugi housing areas.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it can't be cleaned up then it should be closed down,''
Cohen said at Atsugi, where he also addressed several hundred
sailors and told them he was doing his best to eliminate this
health hazard.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Japan's Environment Agency said the levels of
carcinogenic dioxin were dangerously high near Atsugi, which is
home to the air wing assigned to the USS Kitty Hawk carrier battle
group.
</P>
<P>
   A study conducted last summer by the Japanese government and the
U.S. Navy found dioxin in concentrations 10 times above Japanese
standards, Navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr. James Graybeal said today. He
said the plant's owner has escaped penalty by finding loopholes in
Japan's environmental laws.
</P>
<P>
   The deal as described by Kawara -- and elaborated on by a senior
U.S. official who declined to be identified -- contains five main
elements, starting with Tokyo's promise to expedite the legal and
bureaucratic process of constructing a 300-foot smokestack at the
incinerator to reduce harmful emissions.
</P>
<P>
   No specific deadline was set, but Kawara said Japan would make
sure the smokestack is completed ''expeditiously.''
</P>
<P>
   The four other elements are:
</P>
<P>
   -- A government pledge to make sure that Shinkampo's owner
completes installation of special filters on two of its burners by
the end of March and then shuts down the third burner so it can be
fitted with a filter.
</P>
<P>
   -- A joint U.S.-Japan monitoring plan to survey the ambient air
around the plant for as long as deemed necessary.
</P>
<P>
   -- The government will not object to the U.S. government's
efforts to sue Shinkampo for violation of environmental laws. The
U.S. official told reporters that Washington plans to file such a
suit this spring and would ask the Japanese court for an injunction
to halt the plant's operations in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   -- The government will provide temporary off-base housing for all
who wish it, at no cost to U.S. personnel. This would be provided
until the 300-foot smokestack is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Together the measures are likely to cost the Japanese government
hundreds of millions of dollars, the U.S. official said. There is
an informal understanding, the official said, that if the measures
announced today fail to eliminate the pollution problem the
government will close down the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and Kawara also discussed the status of negotiations on a
new five-year agreement under which the government pays part of the
cost of having 47,000 American troops on its soil. Japanese
officials have indicated they may want to reduce the $5 billion a
year that Tokyo pays under the current arrangement, which expires
in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials have said they are hopeful of reaching a new
''host nation support'' agreement by this summer, when President
Clinton will travel to Japan for an international summit conference
in Okinawa.

Pakistani Killer To Be Executed
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) -- A court on Thursday sentenced Javed Iqbal to death
in the country's worst serial killing, saying he would be strangled in front of
the parents whose children he was convicted of murdering. Iqbal was sentenced to
be publicly executed in a Lahore park for killing as many as 100 children. He
can appeal his conviction and sentence. After he is strangled, Judge Allah Baksh
Ranja said Iqbal's body ''will then be cut into a 100 pieces and put in acid the
same way you killed the children.'' Iqbal told the court he was innocent.

NASA: Defective Engine Seals Found
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- In another embarrassing mix-up for NASA, flawed
engine seals that should have been thrown away are believed to be in space
shuttle Atlantis. It's the second time in a few months that defective seals have
turned up on a space shuttle instead of in the trash. Two seals intended for the
garbage are apparently in one of Atlantis' main engines, chief engineer Len
Worlund said Wednesday. As a result, NASA will replace that engine before the
shuttle blasts off next month with supplies for the international space station.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the second time in less than a month, independent
truckers, seeking relief from fuel prices that have more than doubled in the
past year, plan to converge on the nation's capital. The National Owner
Operators Trucking Association brought 283 truckers here from the northeastern
United States on Feb. 22. The group has obtained permits for up to 2,500
demonstrators at two sites Thursday, but just five trucks will be allowed on the
Capitol grounds.

Fossils of Tiny Primates Found
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   Anthropologists have discovered fossils from two species of ''teeny, tiny
primates,'' thumb-sized creatures smaller than any other known primate on the
family tree leading to monkeys, apes and humans. The fossilized foot bones, each
about the size of a grain of rice, were sifted from tons of muddy rubbish at a
limestone mine in eastern China. About 45 million years ago, the fragile
primates lived in a rain forest, feeding on insects and sap. Scientists from
Northern Illinois, Northwestern and Beijing's Chinese Academy of Sciences detail
the species in this week's Journal of Human Evolution.

Study: EMF, Suicide Risk Linked

<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Chronic exposure to low-frequency electromagnetic
fields may be responsible for a higher suicide risk among electric utility
workers, according to researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill. While unable to prove that exposure causes suicide, researchers found
electricians for five U.S. power companies had twice the suicide rate and
linemen 1{ times the rate of utility workers not employed in those jobs. The
findings appeared Wednesday in the April issue of Occupational and Environmental
Medicine.

Couple Wins $26M in Ford Case

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A jury has ordered Ford Motor Co. to pay nearly $26
million to a man whose Bronco truck rolled over on a freeway in 1996, leaving
him quadriplegic. An Alameda Superior Court jury on Tuesday determined Richard
Raimondi and his wife, Dana, had suffered $52 million in damages. But they
awarded them half that amount after finding Mr. Raimondi shared responsibility
with Ford for the accident. Attorneys for Ford said the company would ask a
judge to set aside or reduce the verdict, and would appeal if their efforts
fail.

being released last week at a Wal-Mart, police said. Alachua County Sheriff's
investigators identified the suspect as James Paul Johnson. Johnson is charged
with one count of kidnapping and one count of kidnapping with special

on a child under the age of 11 years old.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Court Colleagues' Votes  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the midst of collecting cash for their
Republican colleagues, Reps. Billy Tauzin and Mike Oxley hope they
are also collecting votes in their competition to head one of the
House's most powerful committees.
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin and Oxley want to succeed retiring Rep. Thomas Bliley,
R-Va., as chairman of the House Commerce Committee. They are
raising money in hopes of retaining GOP control of Congress and
solidifying loyalties once committee chairmanship posts come up for
a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to self-imposed six-year term limits for committee
chairmen, GOP lawmakers are jockeying to position themselves for
plum assignments that would become available next year if the GOP
remains in charge of the House.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole thing with the chairmanship is not about raising
money,'' Oxley said. ''I look at it as part of my responsibility to
the conference to keep us in the majority.''
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin, a Democratic convert from Louisiana, and Ohio's Oxley
are sharing funds from their campaign bank accounts, raising money
for others through leadership political action committees they
formed and hosting dinners for the National Republican
Congressional Committee, the House GOP's fund-raising arm.
</P>
<P>
   Oxley chaired a $10,000-a-plate event in New York City last
January that brought in $1.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin takes his turn tonight as organizer of the House GOP's
annual dinner in Washington, which is expected to raise a record
$5.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like the bidding war is off and running,'' said Larry
Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics,
a nonpartisan research group that studies money and campaigns.
''Their dollars are probably the things that will propel one of
these two guys into the chairmanship.''
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce post is one of Congress' plum assignments. The
committee handles legislation for industries that touch every facet
of Americans' lives from telephones, cable TV and the Internet to
airlines and drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   Other soon-to-be vacant chairmanships also have spawned hot
races. Rep. Philip Crane of Illinois is battling House
Administration Committee chairman Bill Thomas of California to head
the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee. The current chairman,
Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   Other battles are likely for control of the International
Relations, Armed Services, and Banking and Financial Services
committees, whose chairmen must leave their positions in 2001
because of term limits imposed by House Republicans in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Although the majority party's leadership plays a key role in
selecting chairmen, the candidates formally are voted on behind
closed doors by their colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Oxley and Tauzin provide a glimpse into how the battles are
waged.
</P>
<P>
   Through Dec. 31, Oxley had doled out $107,887 from his campaign
committee and leadership PAC to colleagues, while Tauzin
contributed $79,889.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Oxley was the featured guest at a
$1,000-per-person dinner for Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. And next
month, he headlines a fund-raiser for Rep. Greg Walden of Oregon at
the Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young concert in downtown Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Tauzin is cooking up a ''cajun luncheon''
next week for Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan and staging a ''cajun
cookout'' for Rep. Anne Northup of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Oxley, chairman of the Commerce Committee's finance and
hazardous materials subcommittee, played a key role in passing
legislation that broke down the Depression-era barriers against
banks, insurance companies and investment firms competing against
each other.
</P>
<P>
   He enlisted one of the leading industry advocates of the bill,
Merrill Lynch chairman David Komansky, to co-chair the January
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin also leads an important subcommittee --
Telecommunications, Trade and Consumer Protection -- which is
overseeing the deregulation of the telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
   He also has enlisted industries regulated by his committee:
Lodwrick Cook, co-chairman of the telecommunications company Global
Crossing Ltd., has a major role at Thursday's dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Both lawmakers stress, however, their first task is to keep
Democrats from winning back the House. Otherwise, Rep. John
Dingell, the senior Democrat on the committee, will likely be
presiding in the chairman's seat next January.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm focused on one thing when it comes to fund raising,''
Tauzin said. ''I'll be saluting John Dingell if we're not going to
be in the majority. We'll worry about chairmanships later.''

<HEADLINE> House Committee Passes 2001 Budget  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans are downplaying the
difference between the tax cuts they have put in their fiscal 2001
budget and the deeper reductions advanced by their party's likely
presidential nominee, George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats, looking to drive a wedge between Bush and
congressional Republicans, are criticizing the Texas governor's tax
cut plan as too costly -- and daring GOP lawmakers to support it. On
Wednesday, Republicans eluded a Democratic effort to force a House
Budget Committee vote on whether they would include the Bush
proposal in next year's federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuvering came as Republicans pushed a $1.82 trillion
budget for next year through the budget panel. On the near
party-line 23-18 vote, only Rep. Mac Collins, R-Ga., defected.
</P>
<P>
   The measure -- a blueprint for fiscal 2001 spending and tax bills
Congress will work on later -- contains about $50 billion more in
tax cuts than President Clinton wants, and less domestic spending.
It would provide $307 billion for next year's defense budget, $1
billion higher than Clinton's plan. Its $290 billion for domestic
programs is nearly $30 billion less than Clinton prefers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the wrong approach for America,'' Clinton said in a
written statement.
</P>
<P>
   But the budget also spotlighted the warring political needs of
Bush and GOP lawmakers in this election year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has made a five-year, $483 billion tax cut a defining issue
of his campaign in a bid to rally conservatives to his cause.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans would specifically set aside $150
billion for tax cuts, though they would leave room for perhaps $90
billion more. They want to avoid another veto fight with Clinton
and save a major tax-cut push for next year, when they hope Bush
will be president, as well as satisfy internal demands for more
spending for defense and some domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional GOP plan covers fiscal 2001 through 2005,
while Bush's would not begin until 2002. House Budget Committee
Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, estimated that through 2005, Bush's
package would cost about $300 billion, leaving the two plans in
what he called ''close proximity.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Get us a Republican president'' and we'll fight for tax cuts
as large as Bush's, Kasich said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, underlining the differences between the two sides, Bush
spokeswoman Mindy Tucker distanced the governor from the House GOP
package.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe it's possible to meet basic needs, fund priorities
and return money to the taxpayers without increasing spending as
rapidly as this proposal contemplates,'' Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   She also said Bush ''does recognize the pressure Congress
currently has with a Democrat president who is pressuring them to
spend money on bigger government. That will not be a problem with a
President Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has contrasted himself with the GOP-run Congress before.
Last year, he accused Republicans of trying to ''balance their
budget on the backs of the poor'' with a plan to squeeze savings
from working families collecting the earned income tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker said the Bush campaign ''has not directed'' congressional
GOP budget-writing efforts in an effort to make their tax cut
larger.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Kasich fought and lost a battle with House GOP
leaders to include Bush's tax plan in the budget. Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, is waging that same fight in the Senate Budget Committee,
where Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., plans votes on a budget like
Kasich's next week.
</P>
<P>
   At the budget committee, Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., tried
forcing the budget committee to vote on whether to accept Bush's
tax cuts in full. He said it is so expensive that it would erode
Social Security surpluses, something both parties have vowed to
avoid.
</P>
<P>
   But McDermott was outmaneuvered when by voice vote, Republicans
altered his amendment to call for unearthing federal waste, fraud
and abuse and using the money for tax cuts and debt reduction. No
direct vote on the Bush tax cuts was taken.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not walking away from the Bush tax cut and neither are the
Republicans on this committee,'' Kasich said. ''We can't get all
the way there with this president.''
</P>
<P>
   As the budget panel worked on the plan, Democrats tried
repeatedly -- and unsuccessfully -- to shrink the tax cut, beef up
the Social Security and Medicare trust funds and boost spending for
debt reduction and education. The votes were mostly party line.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and congressional Republicans would set aside all
$977 billion in projected Social Security surpluses through 2005
for debt reduction.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Pressured on Safety Spending  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A government watchdog says safety hazards in
New York and New Jersey train tunnels should be a top priority for
Amtrak spending.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Mead, inspector general at the Department of
Transportation, said Wednesday that a train accident in tunnels
connecting New Jersey to New York City under the Hudson River, or
New York City to Long Island under the East River, could be
disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion before the House Appropriations subcommittee on
transportation highlighted the pressure on Amtrak to spend money on
existing problems even as it tries to grow its business to meet an
Oct. 1, 2002, deadline for financial self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are lots of competing needs, and they're all
important,'' said Amtrak President George Warrington.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, the congressional hearing took place hours after
an Amtrak train derailed in Kansas, injuring 29 people.
</P>
<P>
   Mead showed a photograph of a spiral staircase, 10 stories tall,
wide enough for only one person, which would have to accommodate
people fleeing a tunnel accident as well as rescuers trying to
reach it from above.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you had a serious tunnel fire, the existing systems they
have for evacuation aren't ones you or I would like to contend
with,'' Mead said.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated it would cost $654 million to address fire and
safety issues in the tunnels and in New York's Penn Station.
Amtrak, the Long Island Railroad and NJ Transit, which use the
tunnels, have spent about $150 million so far to address the
problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., the chairman of the subcommittee, was
swayed. ''This really ought to be (priority) number one,'' he said,
pointing to the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Scheinberg, associate director for transportation issues
at the General Accounting Office, said Amtrak is spending most of
its annual funding from Congress to maintain equipment.

<HEADLINE> Symbolic Gun Control Victory  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House has voted narrowly to urge
House-Senate negotiators to meet within two weeks to consider
long-stalled gun controlled legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted last year to institute 72-hour background
checks on gun show sales, but the House rejected that provision in
favor of a 24-hour wait and gun control has been on the back burner
since then.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators are to resolve differences between the two
bills, which also contain a number of other provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the 218-205 House vote Wednesday, 12 female members
of Congress made an emotional appeal at the White House for their
colleagues to move on the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Approval of the non-binding House resolution constituted a rare
victory for gun control and the White House cheered the vote,
calling it a defeat for the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''The NRA's influence on Republicans may be beginning to
break,'' said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. In all, 46
Republicans supported the measure; 32 Democrats opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, New York Gov. George Pataki called Wednesday for a
series of gun control measures in his state that include making
trigger locks mandatory, taking ballistic ''fingerprints'' of guns,
requiring dealers and manufacturers to send to a state lab a test
bullet and shell casing from every handgun they sell in the state,
raising the age for handgun ownership from 18 to 21 and requiring
instant background checks of gun buyers at flea markets and gun
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, 100 religious leaders sent a letter to Congress
supporting Clinton's efforts to reduce gun violence, and the
National Opinion Research Center issued a study that said the 25
percent of Americans who own handguns are far outnumbered by the 37
percent who favor a handgun ban for all except ''police and other
authorized persons.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with House members, President Clinton repeated his
complaint that the NRA has stalled gun legislation with pressure
tactics and an argument against lengthier background checks that he
deemed senseless.
</P>
<P>
   ''Taking a little time and a little inconvenience to save a lot
of lives is a good deal for America,'' Clinton said. ''Why should
this be the only area of our national life where we say no
prevention, only punishment?''
</P>
<P>
   In response, NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre said
the White House was trying to ''demonize'' the NRA to distract
attention from ''the complete collapse of enforcement'' of existing
gun laws by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''They try to focus on anything except what they are vulnerable
on,'' LaPierre said. ''What does a criminal have to fear from these
guys? Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration contends the NRA attack on gun
prosecutions misses the point. Federal policy is to keep the
biggest gun cases and refer lesser ones to state authorities, and
even so, the federal prosecutions rose 25.3 percent in one year, it
says.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Agent Orange Study Said Slow  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Critics says the Air Force has been too slow
and too secretive in studying whether the herbicide Agent Orange
sickened Vietnam veterans, keeping them from getting compensation
in a timely manner.
</P>
<P>
   But the senior investigator of the military's study, Joe
Michalck, told a House panel Wednesday that the Agent Orange matter
''one of the best epidemiological studies ever conducted.''
</P>
<P>
   Controversy has surrounded the Ranch Hand study, a project
started in 1981 to determine whether exposure to defoliants in
Vietnam caused the health problems of veterans who served there.
</P>
<P>
   It has cost an estimated $140 million.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy resurfaced Wednesday as a House Government Reform
Committee panel reviewed a separate report by the General
Accounting Office that found veterans needing health compensation
have benefitted little from the study, which was named after the
herbicide spraying operation in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Ranch Hand study has had limited impact on decisions
affecting veterans' compensation,'' Kwai-Cheung Chan of the GAO,
Congress' investigative arm, said in prepared testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Chan said the GAO report found the Air Force has only made a
small portion of its findings available to scientists and veterans,
though it was mandated to release information periodically over the
course of the 25-year study.
</P>
<P>
   Chan noted that congressional critics and news reports have
previously touched on some of the study's problems, adding that
some have been corrected while others persist.
</P>
<P>
   The Ranch Hand study will follow until 2006 the health of 1,300
Air Force personnel who sprayed Agent Orange in Vietnam to
defoliate swaths of Vietnam's jungles and deprive North Vietnamese
troops of cover.
</P>
<P>
   The study contrasts the health of U.S. troops involved in the
spraying to a group not involved but matched by age, race and
military occupation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The failure to communicate an honest scientific appraisal of
its own work is, in part, responsible for the fact that Vietnam
veterans are being compensated for so few diseases they or their
offspring may have developed as a result of their exposure to
herbicides during the Vietnam War,'' John F. Sommer, Jr., executive
director of the American Legion, said in a statement prepared for
the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Veterans' Affairs says it provides
compensation for 8,000 veterans with some dozen diseases believed
associated with Agent Orange, including chloracne skin disorder,
some nerve disorders and several types of cancer in addition to
providing benefits for children with the birth defect spina bifida.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Gives Missile Frigate to Poland  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- The USS Clark has begun a second career,
this time in the Polish navy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being turned into scrap, the 20-year-old
guided-missile frigate was transferred to the fledgling NATO member
on Wednesday as part of an effort to upgrade Poland's fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Sailors hauled down the Clark's commissioning pennant and the
American flag and the Clark's American crew walked off the ship
during a ceremony at the Norfolk Naval Station. The Clark's
American skipper, Cmdr. Albert F. Lord Jr., then turned the ship
over to its Polish commanding officer, Cmdr. Marian Ambroziak.
</P>
<P>
   Poland's red-over-white striped flag was hoisted and the Polish
crew came aboard the ship, re-christened FRR 272.
</P>
<P>
   The Clark is the first of two U.S. Navy ships scheduled to be
transferred to Poland, which joined NATO a year ago. At 445 feet
long, it becomes the second-largest ship in the country's navy.
</P>
<P>
   With a primarily Baltic fleet, Poland now needs bigger ships
that can handle operations in the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The ship's American sailors and its new Polish crew have sailed
together three times since early January in preparation for the
transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Poland also received a U.S. submarine during World War II,
Ambroziak said.

<HEADLINE> NRA Exec Steps Up Attack on Clinton  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A National Rifle Association executive has
stepped up his attack on President Clinton, saying that the blood
of a murdered coach is on the president's hands.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart today denounced the comment
by Wayne LaPierre as ''sick rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The NRA will do anything, say anything to change the subject
away from sensible gun-safety legislation that will save lives,''
Lockhart said on ABC's ''Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart's comments came a day after gun-control advocates won a
rare -- though symbolic -- victory in Congress. The House, in a
nonbinding 218-205 vote, urged House and Senate negotiators to meet
within two weeks to work out a compromise on long-stalled gun
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton has increased pressure on Congress to toughen
gun-safety laws, the NRA -- which contends the administration will
not enforce existing laws -- has increasingly personalized its
disagreement with the president.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on ABC Wednesday night, LaPierre said of
Clinton: ''Has he looked into the eyes of Ricky Byrdsong's family?
Because that blood is on his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrdsong, a former Northwestern University basketball coach, was
shot to death last summer in a two-state shooting spree in which
one other person died and nine were wounded. Authorities determined
later that the white supremacist responsible for the shootings had
failed a Brady law background check but had not been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was not reported to the federal government -- the Brady
background check on this gentleman -- until after the tragic
killing,'' Lockhart said. ''Mr. LaPierre knows the president has
looked into the eyes of these victims. He talked to Ricky
Byrdsong's wife. That's something Wayne LaPierre or anyone from the
NRA doesn't have the guts to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In a weekend interview, LaPierre asserted that Clinton was
''willing to accept a certain level of killing to further his
political agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said today that the real issue is not what NRA is
saying but what Congress is doing. ''We've waited nine long months.
... We need to see some action,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted last year to institute 72-hour background
checks on gun show sales, but the House rejected that provision in
favor of a 24-hour wait, and gun control has been on the back
burner since then.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators from the House and Senate are supposed to resolve
differences between the two bills, which also contain a number of
other provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the House vote Wednesday, 12 female members of
Congress made an emotional appeal at the White House for their
colleagues to move on the legislation. On the vote, 46 Republicans
voted for the resolution and 32 Democrats opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who has clinched the
Republican presidential nomination, said he might favor a law
requiring every new firearm to include technology that would allow
the weapons to be fired only when matched to the owner's
fingerprint. And he told reporters he is willing to sign a law
requiring that trigger locks be sold with all handguns, although he
doubts it would reduce gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, New York Gov. George Pataki called for a series of
gun-control measures in his state that include making trigger locks
mandatory, taking ballistic ''fingerprints'' of guns, requiring
dealers and manufacturers to send to a state lab a test bullet and
shell casing from every handgun they sell in the state, raising the
age for handgun ownership from 18 to 21 and requiring instant
background checks of gun buyers at flea markets and gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, 100 religious leaders sent a letter to Congress
supporting Clinton's efforts to reduce gun violence. And the
National Opinion Research Center issued a study that said the 25
percent of Americans who own handguns are far outnumbered by the 37
percent who favor a handgun ban for all except ''police and other
authorized persons.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with House members, Clinton repeated his complaint that
the NRA has stalled gun legislation with pressure tactics and an
argument he deemed senseless against lengthier background checks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Taking a little time and a little inconvenience to save a lot
of lives is a good deal for America,'' Clinton said. ''Why should
this be the only area of our national life where we say no
prevention, only punishment?''
</P>
<P>
   In response, LaPierre said the White House was trying to
''demonize'' the NRA to distract attention from ''the complete
collapse of enforcement'' of existing gun laws by the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''They try to focus on anything except what they are vulnerable
on,'' LaPierre said. ''What does a criminal have to fear from these
guys? Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration contends the NRA attack on gun
prosecutions misses the point. Federal policy is to keep the
biggest gun cases and refer lesser ones to state authorities, and
even so, the federal prosecutions rose 25.3 percent in one year, it
says.

<HEADLINE> FDA Mulls Diabetes Drug Disclosure  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FDA is studying a request that it
investigate a major drug manufacturer for delaying submission of
information that a diabetes drug could cause liver problems in some
patients.
</P>
<P>
   The public interest group Public Citizen called for the probe
into Warner-Lambert/Parke-Davis, charging the company knew of
instances of liver problems associated with the drug Rezulin before
it went on the market, but delayed informing the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   An FDA spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
agency is reviewing the request for an investigation and will take
whatever action is appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert spokeswoman Carol Goodrich today called Public
Citizen's charges ''baseless.'' ''We intend to address the facts
surrounding our submission of data directly with FDA,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 the FDA required a change in the label for Rezulin --
also known as troglitazone -- to warn of possible liver toxicity.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 221.83; Nasdaq Falls 99.27  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks extended their slide today,
pushing the Nasdaq composite index more than 11 percent below its
peak last week, into what many on Wall Street consider a
correction.
</P>
<P>
   Blue-chip stocks, however, roared higher in heavy trading as
they attracted money that is leaving the technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index
was down 99.27 at 4,483.35, extending its sharp decline this week.
Since the Nasdaq closed Friday at a record 5,048.62, the index has
shed 11.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Market watchers consider a loss of 10 percent a correction,
which signifies a sudden reversal of a market trend but doesn't
necessarily mark a long-term change. Many analysts believed the
Nasdaq, which had risen 24 percent in the year to date, was overdue
for a correction.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Dow Jones industrial average fell into a
correction in mid-February, and has struggled until this week.
Today, the Dow was up 221.83 at 10,353.24, extending a 320-point
gain on Wednesday that represented its biggest surge in 17 months.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was up 17.87 at 1,410.01.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq reversed an early gain as investors sold stocks that
have performed best in the year to date. Xilinx fell 3 1/16 to 66[,
3Com fell 2 to 59 1/16, and Cisco Systems fell 3 5/16 to 125 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of these high-growth stocks had gotten to such extreme
valuations,'' said Matt Finn, chief investment officer of the
growth and income group at Evergreen Funds in Boston. ''They were
due to come down.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a wide range of stocks led the Dow higher. American
Express rose 8[ to 141, Johnson &AMP; Johnson rose 2} to 79 11/16, and
3M rose 3 5/16 to 85 13/16. Many of those shares have been beaten
down in recent weeks as investors poured money into technology
stocks, and are now enticing investors as relative bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rose even after the Labor Department's Producer Price
Index showed that wholesale prices surged 1 percent in February,
the largest gain in nearly 10 years, as gasoline, home heating oil
and other energy costs rose.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation figures, including the Consumer Price Index due for
release on Friday, are sure to be used by the Federal Reserve as
evidence that still higher interest rates are needed to cool the
economy. In a continuing effort to keep inflation at bay, the Fed
has raised rates four times since last June, and it meets again
Tuesday. Investors are expecting a fifth rate hike.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors were heartened by the fact that the ''core''
rate of inflation at the wholesale level, which excludes the
volatile energy and food categories, matched expectations with a
0.3 percent gain in today's report.
</P>
<P>
   ''The core rate was in line with what we expected,'' said Finn.
''The Fed is on its way to taking the edge off inflation, and it's
looking like they aren't going to have to be excessive to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The bond market improved modestly, lending support to stocks.
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.04 percent from
6.07 percent late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 428.11 million
shares at late morning, well ahead of Wednesday's heavy pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 9.84 to 549.03.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- A meeting of Evangelical Lutheran
Church in America bishops has sent its 5.2 million members a
pastoral letter acknowledging ''deep concern and opposition''
regarding a unity pact with the Episcopal Church but urging
Lutherans to accept it.
</P>
<P>
   The ''full communion'' pact, which allows sharing of ministers
and sacraments, passed overwhelmingly at the Lutherans' convention
last year and comes up for approval at the Episcopal Church
convention in July.
</P>
<P>
   The Word Alone Network, a group of Lutherans opposed to the
agreement, has organized more than 100 regional meetings. Last
month a caucus of 18 Lutherans from both sides of the debate met in
Milwaukee to draft a ''Common Ground'' statement and bridge the
gap.
</P>
<P>
   Some Lutherans object to the requirement that they accept the
Episcopal concept of the ''historic episcopate,'' a succession of
bishops dating from the origins of Christianity, and the rule that
only such bishops have power to ordain clergy.
</P>
<P>
   Lutherans historically have allowed a variety of church
structures, and have emphasized the ''priesthood of all
believers.''
</P>
<P>
   The bishops' letter calls for discussion about altering the
clergy ordination rule ''in unusual circumstances and with
appropriate consultation.'' However, it appears unlikely that
Episcopalians would change their stance.
</P>
<P>
   One opponent, Bishop Rick Foss of Fargo, N.D., claims as many as
half of Lutheran church members oppose the pact. He said the
bishops' discussion was ''difficult and draining'' and called the
letter ''a first attempt, officially, to acknowledge that some
people are going to find it very hard to live with it.''

Evangelical association opens up membership rule
</P>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Rewriting a rule that dates from its
founding in 1943, the National Association of Evangelicals (NAE)
has decided to admit denominations that affirm its conservative
creed even if they also hold membership in the National Council of
Churches (NCC).
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional change by an NAE board meeting resulted from
a 1999 inquiry about such dual membership from the 260,000-member
Reformed Church in America, a charter member of the NCC.
</P>
<P>
   The NCC, based in New York City, is the larger of the two church
federations, with a constituency of 33 Protestant and Orthodox
denominations that have 100,000 local congregations.
</P>
<P>
   The NAE, with offices in Glendora, Calif., includes 51
Protestant denominations and 45,000 local congregations. It also
represents 250 interdenominational organizations such as National
Religious Broadcasters and World Relief.
</P>
<P>
   NAE President Kevin Mannoia, who took office last year just as
the Reformed Church sent its request, said the change means
evangelicals no longer define themselves in relation to other
interchurch organizations. He called it ''a statement of maturity
and strength of identity.''
</P>
<P>
   ''To me, this is a monumental decision,'' Mannoia said. ''The
ramifications are as yet unseen.''

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A widely circulated Kansas City Star report that
U.S. Roman Catholic priests die of AIDS at a rate four times the
general population continues to stir debate.
</P>
<P>
   The Star later amended its Jan. 30 article to say priests die at
double the rate for other adult men.
</P>
<P>
   But an AIDS expert writes in the current edition of America
magazine that priests' death rate is not higher, and that new
infections among clergy have actually ''trended downward over
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The writer is Jon Fuller, a Jesuit, physician, medical school
professor in Boston and founder of the National Catholic AIDS
Network. Fuller estimates the HIV infection rate at between 0.25
percent and one percent for clergy, compared with a United Nations
estimate of 0.5 percent for all U.S. adults.
</P>
<P>
   The Star's statistics are also criticized on NewsWatch, a media
watchdog site on the Web, by David Murray of the Statistical
Assessment Service. Using data for the 1990s from the Statistical
Abstract of the United States, Murray says the AIDS death rate for
priests and other Americans is similar.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to critics, the Star said its estimate came from
medical experts and counselors who have treated priests with HIV
and AIDS. It did not identify them.
</P>
<P>
   Monsignor Francis Maniscalco, communications director for the
U.S. bishops' conference, said ''this was a highly sensationalized
description of the situation. The tragedy of individuals was
portrayed as a crisis of the institution. That was not borne out by
the statistics.''

Waco sect's new church won't be ready by April 19 anniversary
</P>
<P>
   WACO, Texas (AP) -- Due to lagging donations and lack of
volunteer labor, the remaining Branch Davidians won't have a new
church ready for the seventh anniversary of their fiery standoff
with federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   The group plans to worship at the site of the tragedy April 19,
but builders said the new church will probably lack seating,
flooring and plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   Davidians who survived the 51-day standoff say the project began
when libertarian radio talk show host Alex Jones and an aide asked
what they could do to help David Koresh's remaining disciples
restore what they lost in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Some $83,000 has been donated.

U.S. Muslims protest NBC-TV's comedy series on God
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Muslim organization has been the first
religious group to publicly protest ''God, the Devil and Bob,'' a
new animated comedy series on NBC-TV.
</P>
<P>
   ''This kind of tasteless and trivial portrayal of God does a
disservice to the millions of American television viewers who have
deeply felt religious beliefs,'' declared Nihad Awad, executive
director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations.
</P>
<P>
   The council is urging viewers to contact the network and
affiliated stations and express concern about companies that buy
ads on the show.
</P>
<P>
   The series deals with a Detroit auto worker named Bob who meets
God in a bar and discusses moral questions and whether mankind is
worth saving.
</P>
<P>
   At least nine of NBC's 215 affiliates have refused to carry the
sitcom saying it contains offensive matter. They include KSL in
Salt Lake City, owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints.

Indiana diocese to forgive church debts
</P>
<P>
   GARY, Ind. (AP) -- Citing a strong economy and the principle of
stewardship, the Roman Catholic diocese of Gary said it will reduce
or forgive debts of $2.8 million for eight parishes and
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Diocesan spokesman Brian Olszewski said investment earnings made
the plan possible. ''We're a forgiving church. We practice what we
preach,'' he said. ''Through the country, I think more and more
dioceses will be doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   A typical beneficiary is St. Mary of the Lake parish. ''To keep
the school running, for a while we had to pump money in. The parish
could no longer do it,'' said the Rev. Tom Mischler. ''It truly is
a weight lifted off us. We can begin to think about creating
programs. People are attracted to a parish when they see action.''

Orthodox Jews launch ''virtual Purim'' Web site
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- An Orthodox Jewish group has posted a Web site
to help believers around the world observe the festival of Purim.
</P>
<P>
   Purin, which celebrates Haman's failure to annihilate the Jews
as recorded in the biblical book of Esther, falls on March 20-21.
</P>
<P>
   The site, www.virtualpurim.com, is sponsored by the Lubavitch
branch of Hasidic Jews and its Chabad centers.
</P>
<P>
   It gives detailed information about the holiday and how to
celebrate it, with an interactive Ask-the-Rabbi section, children's
games, recipes, prayer and study guides, a worldwide on-line
costume contest and an audio selection of holiday songs.

Church suit calls city zoning policy unconstitutional
</P>
<P>
   GRAND HAVEN, Mich. (AP) -- A local church is suing the city in
federal court, alleging zoning rules discriminate against religious
organizations and violate the Constitution.	   Haven Shores Community Church
wants to open a storefront worship
center in a shopping center. Its lawsuit says the zoning board
discriminated by ''applying a vague ordinance'' and prohibiting
worship ''in a location where similar, but non-religious, groups
would be permitted to associate.''
</P>
<P>
   The city council supports existing zoning regulations, citing
traffic and concern that customers might be reluctant to shop
during worship times.
</P>
<P>
   The church is represented by the Becket Fund of Washington,
D.C., a non-profit legal group.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 348.72; Nasdaq Takes Drop  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow industrials roared more than 300 points
higher for a second straight day today as blue-chip stocks
attracted money that is leaving the technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks extended their slide, pushing the Nasdaq
composite index to the borders of what many on Wall Street consider
a ''correction.''
</P>
<P>
   In heavy midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 348.72, or 3.4 percent, at 10,480.13, extending a
320-point gain on Wednesday that represented its biggest surge in
17 months.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index was down 19.18 at 4,563.44, having
clawed back from an earlier loss of 127 points. Today's loss
followed a plunge of 465 points over the past three sessions. Since
the Nasdaq closed Friday at a record 5,048.62, the index has shed
9.6 percent. At its low of the day, it was down 11.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Market watchers consider a loss of 10 percent a correction,
which signifies a sudden reversal of a market trend but doesn't
necessarily mark a long-term change. Many analysts believed the
Nasdaq, which had risen 24 percent in the year to date, was overdue
for a correction.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors were snapping up shares of companies
that have been driven well below their previous highs in recent
months. Investors' willingness to dump blue-chip stocks in favor of
technology stocks pushed the Dow into a correction in mid-February,
and the index has struggled until this week.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a wide range of stocks led the Dow higher. American
Express rose 10[ to 141, Johnson &AMP; Johnson rose 3 3/16 to 80[, and
3M rose 4{ to 87. Many of those shares have been beaten down in
recent weeks as investors poured money into technology stocks, and
are now enticing investors as relative bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Investors sold Nasdaq stocks that have performed best in the
year to date. Xilinx fell 3 1/16 to 66[, 3Com fell 1 1/16 to 60,
and Cisco Systems fell 1 to 127|.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of these high-growth stocks had gotten to such extreme
valuations,'' said Matt Finn, chief investment officer of the
growth and income group at Evergreen Funds in Boston. ''They were
due to come down.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue-chip stocks rose even after the Labor Department's Producer
Price Index showed that wholesale prices surged 1 percent in
February, the largest gain in nearly 10 years, as gasoline, home
heating oil and other energy costs rose.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation figures, including the Consumer Price Index due for
release on Friday, are sure to be closely watched by the Federal
Reserve as it weighs whether still higher interest rates are needed
to cool the economy. In a continuing effort to keep inflation at
bay, the Fed has raised rates four times since last June, and it
meets again Tuesday, when investors are expecting a fifth rate
hike.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors were heartened by the fact that the ''core''
rate of inflation at the wholesale level, which excludes the
volatile energy and food categories, matched expectations with a
0.3 percent gain in today's report.
</P>
<P>
   ''The core rate was in line with what we expected,'' said Finn.
''The Fed is on its way to taking the edge off inflation, and it's
looking like they aren't going to have to be excessive to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The bond market improved modestly, lending support to stocks.
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.06 percent from
6.07 percent late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Broad market indicators were mixed today. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 38.02 at 1,430.16 and the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 2.57 to 556.31.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 667.30 million
shares at midday, well ahead of Wednesday's heavy pace.

<HEADLINE> White House Cites NRA Sick Rhetoric  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today praised the House for
taking ''a small but significant step'' toward passing gun
legislation. He brushed aside an accusation by the National Rifle
Association leader that he has the blood of a murdered coach on his
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Before heading to lunch with the House speaker, Clinton told
reporters that his administration is seeking extra money from
Congress to bolster enforcement, but also has tried to leave gun
cases with local, rather than federal, prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what we've tried to do is the right course,'' Clinton
said. As for NRA criticisms that federal authorities have failed to
pursue criminals whose gun purchases are thwarted by background
checks, Clinton said:
</P>
<P>
   ''It's truly ironic that the NRA is now criticizing us for not
throwing everybody in jail that fails a Brady background check. If
it had been up to them, we wouldn't be doing these background
checks.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said he was pleased by Wednesday's House vote
calling for a conference committee to set a meeting to iron out a
compromise gun bill, ''after eight months and other senseless
shootings.'' He cautioned lawmakers to remember that getting a gun
bill passed will be a long battle, but said it was brave of them to
''say no to the name-calling and no to the threats'' of the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton declined to address NRA Executive Vice President Wayne
LaPierre's latest comment that his hands have the blood of a
murdered coach on them. ''Getting into a personal spat with Mr.
LaPierre about tactics I don't think any American appreciates, and
any American can see through, is not worth doing.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on ABC Wednesday night, LaPierre responded to
Clinton's call that LaPierre ''look into the eyes'' of parents
whose children were killed by gun violence by saying: ''Has he
looked into the eyes of Ricky Byrdsong's family? Because that blood
is on his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House reacted angrily to that statement. ''Just when
you think a human being couldn't go any lower, Wayne LaPierre and
the NRA found a way,'' Lockhart said. ''This kind of sick rhetoric
should stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrdsong, a former Northwestern University basketball coach, was
shot to death last summer in a two-state shooting spree in which
one other person died and nine were wounded. Authorities determined
later that the white supremacist responsible for the shootings had
failed a Brady law background check but had not been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said federal officials were not aware of the killer's
background check until six days after Byrdsong's death, a fact he
said LaPierre ''knows full well.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart's comments came a day after gun-control advocates won a
rare -- though symbolic -- victory in Congress. The House, in a
nonbinding 218-205 vote, urged House and Senate negotiators to meet
within two weeks to work out a compromise on long-stalled gun
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Republican leadership in Congress should do two things
now: Stand up and publicly repudiate this, then push aside the NRA
and get moving on commonsense gun legislation,'' Lockhart said.
''Let the will of the House, not the will of the NRA, rule the
day.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton has increased pressure on Congress to toughen
gun-safety laws, the NRA -- which contends the administration will
not enforce existing laws -- has increasingly personalized its
disagreement with the president. In a weekend interview, LaPierre
asserted that Clinton was ''willing to accept a certain level of
killing to further his political agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted last year to institute 72-hour background
checks on gun show sales, but the House rejected that provision in
favor of a 24-hour wait, and gun control has been on the back
burner since then.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators from the House and Senate are supposed to resolve
differences between the two bills, which also contain a number of
other provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the House vote Wednesday, 12 female members of
Congress made an emotional appeal at the White House for their
colleagues to move on the legislation. On the vote, 46 Republicans
voted for the resolution and 32 Democrats opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who has clinched the
Republican presidential nomination, said he might favor a law
requiring every new firearm to include technology that would allow
the weapons to be fired only when matched to the owner's
fingerprint. And he told reporters he is willing to sign a law
requiring that trigger locks be sold with all handguns, although he
doubts it would reduce gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, New York Gov. George Pataki called for a series of
gun-control measures in his state that include making trigger locks
mandatory, taking ballistic ''fingerprints'' of guns, requiring
dealers and manufacturers to send to a state lab a test bullet and
shell casing from every handgun they sell in the state, raising the
age for handgun ownership from 18 to 21 and requiring instant
background checks of gun buyers at flea markets and gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, 100 religious leaders sent a letter to Congress
supporting Clinton's efforts to reduce gun violence. And the
National Opinion Research Center issued a study that said the 25
percent of Americans who own handguns are far outnumbered by the 37
percent who favor a handgun ban for all except ''police and other
authorized persons.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 435.90; Nasdaq Takes Drop  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow industrials surged more than 400 points
Thursday, as more bargain-hunting among ''old'' economy issues
helped extend sharp gains for blue-chip stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-focused Nasdaq Stock Market, which had been
adding to its recent swoon from record heights, reversed course in
the afternoon and was rising.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 435.90 points, or by 4.3
percent, at 10,567.31 by early afternoon. If it held through
closing, it would be the sharpest point gain ever for Wall Street's
best-known indicator. Even with the gain, the Dow remained 9.9
percent below its Jan. 14 record of 11,722.98.
</P>
<P>
   Investors' willingness to dump blue-chip stocks in favor of
technology stocks pushed the Dow into a ''correction'' in
mid-February, and the index has struggled until this week.
</P>
<P>
   But traders are once more paying attention to old-line
companies, and companies like American Express, Johnson &AMP; Johnson
and 3M were leading the Dow higher Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, which closed last Friday at a record
5,048.62, was up 23.61 at 4,606.23 in afternoon trading. At its low
point of the day, the Nasdaq was down 127 points and its decline
from last Friday was 11.8 percent. But with the gain, its decline
was 8.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A drop of more than 10 percent is considered a signal of a
correction, or downturn in a rising market.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of these high-growth stocks had gotten to such extreme
valuations,'' said Matt Finn, chief investment officer of the
growth and income group at Evergreen Funds in Boston. ''They were
due to come down.''

<HEADLINE> Philadelphia airport to move up on list for new radar system  </HEADLINE>
By RON TODT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia International Airport will be
moved up on the priority list for a state-of-the-art air traffic
control system, but the latest technology is still several years
away, said Federal Aviation Administration officials and U.S. Sen.
Arlen Specter on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Specter, R-Pa., and the FAA released the results of a
preliminary investigation by an eight-person team into the cause of
a failure of the automatic radar system March 10. Officials called
the failure a series of three ''scatters'' over a 19-minute period
caused by faulty system cards.
</P>
<P>
   During each 12-second scatter and 4{-second recovery, planes
still showed up on radar as blips on the screen but the system
could not identify each aircraft, its altitude or speed. The
problem was resolved after nine of the 500 system cards were
replaced, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the system could not identify any of the 30 aircraft
then in the air, officials insisted safety was not threatened. They
said controllers could still see the planes and could talk to them
to get them to identify themselves, and there was also a manual
card list of each plane and its flight plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''The system here in Philadelphia is performing at a very high
level. In fact, it's above what I would say is our national
reliability and availability figures,'' said Steve Gallegos, deputy
program director for operations at FAA headquarters in Washington,
who is leading the investigative team.
</P>
<P>
   Flight delays were caused when controllers delayed departures
and put incoming aircraft into a holding pattern as a precaution,
said Cathy Shema of the FAA air traffic planning and procedures
office.
</P>
<P>
   Specter said FAA administrator Jane Garvey had assured him that
Philadelphia, until now ranked 42nd in priority for upgrading the
system, would have a higher priority on a new list to be released
in May.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're going to be looking at moving Philadelphia up
significantly in the schedule,'' said Alan Moore, the FAA's acting
director for airway facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The current ARTS system was installed in Philadelphia in the
early 1970s, although it has since been upgraded.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA's newest system, called STARS, is being tried out in two
smaller airports in Syracuse, N.Y., and El Paso, and will not be
ready for installation in a major airport such as Philadelphia
until 2002 or 2003. The system is currently being used in airports
in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said an upgraded system, called ARTS-3E, has been
installed at four or five airports until the STARS system is ready,
but there are no plans to put it into Philadelphia in the interim.
</P>
<P>
   Specter, however, said he remained concerned about the system
and would press for that upgrade, and would also see if the
schedule for implementing the STARS system could be moved up.
</P>
<P>
   ''I intend to pursue that to see if we can have an improvement
now,'' Specter said. ''We've given them a ton of new money ... and
if there's some way to speed it up, I'm going to push to see that
it's speeded up.''
</P>
<P>
   The eight-member team will continue to examine the current
system's hardware and software over the next few days, Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's radar system failed twice last year, prompting
Specter to tour the control tower in June and push for new air
traffic equipment at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an uncomfortable feeling,'' said Danny Mullin, president
of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association of
Philadelphia. ''It feels like you're going down the highway and you
hit the brakes and they don't work. Sheer panic, then you try to
get your head together and figure out what to do to separate the
airplanes.''

<HEADLINE> Faith Hubley Gets TV Showcase  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In filmmaker Faith Hubley's world, children
joust happily with bathroom dragons, musical notes transform into
jazz dancers, and a woman and a goat play pattycake.
</P>
<P>
   Also part of Hubley's animated vision: a whale ensnared in an
oil-soaked sea, a husband snatched away by death, and brutal
snapshots of European witchhunts that targeted vast numbers of
women.
</P>
<P>
   Both the charm and pain of her ongoing work are on display this
month on Sundance Channel, which is showcasing the films of Hubley,
her late husband, John, and their daughter, Emily.
</P>
<P>
   It is a well-deserved tribute, said Charles Silver, a curator in
the film and video department of New York's Museum of Modern Art.
Faith and John Hubley were bold pioneers in animation beginning in
the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ''They really broke away from the tradition of cartoons as
Saturday afternoon entertainment for children and turned animation
into a much more mature medium, opening all kinds of possibilities
for other filmmakers to make personal films,'' Silver said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hubley images combine touches of Klee, Matisse and other
modern painters with elements of ancient cultures. The messages
range from unabashedly political and philosophical to ruminations
on life, both sweet and sad.
</P>
<P>
   Hubley films have won three Academy Awards, and numerous film
festival and other honors.
</P>
<P>
   Sundance's ''Spotlight on the Hubleys'' packages the family's
short films -- most running about 10 minutes -- to showcase their
solo and collaborative efforts. Among them: Emily Hubley's memory
piece ''Pigeon Within'' (11:50 a.m. EST Friday) and Faith Hubley's
''Everybody Rides the Carousel,'' about human development (9 p.m.
EST Saturday).
</P>
<P>
   Faith Hubley, speaking from her home studio in Manhattan, ''a
lovely room on Central Park South,'' seems to embody her films: She
is by turns droll and somber, playful and exacting. And, at age 75,
as zestful as her celluloid imagery.
</P>
<P>
   She remains committed to one film project a year, her pattern
since 1955.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't stop. It's like an obsession. When Johnny and I got
married, we had two wedding vows. One was to make a personal film a
year. ... When Johnny died (in 1977), I continued because I had
that vow.''
</P>
<P>
   ''And by then, all my genes and my little cells were accustomed
to this rhythm. It would have been cruel to stop,'' Hubley added.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of a dentist and a homemaker, Hubley had to find
her own creative path.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think my father wanted to write, but that isn't what he did.
My mother had a kind of classical dilettante approach -- a little
bit of music, a little bit of that. The last thing she wanted me to
be was an artist. I didn't care. I had no respect for the things
they were into, money and security.''
</P>
<P>
   The family values that Faith Hubley passed on to her four
children are far different. She has forged a creative partnership
with Emily, who helps animate and inks her mother's films in
addition to making her own distinctive animated movies.
</P>
<P>
   Another daughter, Georgia, has joined in as an animator and

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Take Steps on Gas Prices  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today that while he
hopes oil producing countries will move to lower gasoline and oil
prices, there is more the United States can do in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said continued instability in the oil market could
end up ''cratering the economies of other countries and hurting
ours.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I do believe we need to do more here on our own, here in
America,'' to deal with rising petroleum costs, Clinton said at the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   The president did not provide details of anything his
administration might do to ease gas prices that now average $1.54
for a gallon of regular unleaded.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he met with Energy Secretary Bill Richardson on the
subject at the White House this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have talked about the present difficulties that Americans
are facing because of the price of gasoline and the high price of
oil, and what our short and longer-term options are,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been working very hard on this now for several weeks and
... we hope to have some things to say about it over the next few
days,'' Clinton said before leaving the White House for a
bipartisan luncheon on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The main cause for a sharp increase in petroleum costs is OPEC's
decision to cut back on production to raise oil prices that Clinton
said were ''way too low'' last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is in the interests of the OPEC nations and in the
interest of the consuming nations to have a stable price of oil,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Too low and the oil producers cannot manage their domestic
economies, Clinton said. Oil prices that are too high could end up
''cratering'' the economies of some consuming countries, ''and hurt
a lot of innocent people in the process,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have repeatedly said they expect the
OPEC oil producers to increase production. The oil ministers meet
March 27 to consider production levels.
</P>
<P>
   More oil on the market would have a trickle-down effect that
could lower gas and oil prices over several weeks, although man
analysts say pump prices will probably stay high through the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm encouraged by a lot of the developments that are going
on,'' Clinton said. ''I hope there will be some relief soon when
the OPEC meeting occurs.''

<HEADLINE> Asbestos Bill Clears House Panel  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House Judiciary Committee on Thursday
narrowly approved legislation that would set up a new government
agency to speed legal relief to the hundreds of thousands of people
sickened by exposure to asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-15 vote, with most Republicans supporting and Democrats
against, sends the bill to the House floor, where its prospects are
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed Justice Department agency would be responsible for
certifying the eligibility of all asbestos victim claims and coming
up with settlement offers within months, in contrast to the years
it takes many claims to go through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, sponsored by Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., is backed by business groups, including companies facing
lawsuits over asbestos exposure, some of which occurred three and
four decades ago. The Supreme Court has urged Congress to take
legislative action to deal with what it said was a serious backlog
in asbestos cases.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is opposed by trial lawyers and environmental and
consumer groups that contend the legislation would deprive victims
of their legal rights to compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Asbestos is a fibrous mineral once commonly used in insulation
and fireproofing material. The inhaling of asbestos fibers can
cause lung cancer and other deadly respiratory ailments, sometimes
decades after the exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde has argued that a fairer and more efficient system is
needed because 200,000 cases are still pending and there are as
many as 40,000 new lawsuits filed every year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, claimants would have to go to the proposed
Office of Asbestos Compensation in the Justice Department, which
would determine if they are medically eligible. Only people who are
sick could make claims. Those who have signs of asbestos disease,
such as lung scarring, but are otherwise in good health could be
retested at government expense.
</P>
<P>
   Those declared eligible would receive a settlement offer within
a month, with the money coming from a fund paid for by defendant
companies. The claimant could either accept the settlement, proceed
to an administrative court for a ruling within 90 days, or return
to the traditional route of a lawsuit in a state or federal court.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 1283.

<HEADLINE> VA Upgrade Fails To Reduce Delays  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite spending more than $200 million to
upgrade its computers, the agency that distributes compensation for
3.2 million veterans and their survivors takes longer to process
claims than it did a decade ago, according to records and
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   With more than a half million veterans expected to die this year
-- some while awaiting final resolution of claims -- a modern,
computerized system was considered essential to track cases, reduce
backlogs and provide applicants with current information.
</P>
<P>
   But the Veterans Benefits Administration still maintains
hundreds of pages of paper in a typical file and takes an average
of 205 days to complete an original disability claim, compared with
164 in 1991, an Associated Press review found.
</P>
<P>
   ''After hundreds of millions of dollars spent over the past 10
years on VA computer modernization for processing veterans claims,
there has been no tangible return for the veteran or the
taxpayer,'' said Rep. Terry Everett, R-Ala., whose House Veterans
Affairs subcommittee is investigating what he describes as
''terrible'' service to disabled veterans.
</P>
<P>
   The director of VBA's disability compensation and benefit
programs, Robert Epley, acknowledged attempts to upgrade computers
have gone through ''fits and starts'' and bounced ''from issue to
issue'' without a long-term plan.
</P>
<P>
   But he promised dramatic changes within two years in the
programs that dispense $22 billion a year in disability payments to
veterans suffering from injury or disease related to their service.
The agency also distributes pension benefits to eligible survivors
of veterans.
</P>
<P>
   He pledged new computer systems, operated by a better trained
workforce and a reduction in errors. Currently, the agency makes an
error on about a third of claims. About 8 percent of the errors
involve improper benefit amounts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Teams are forming who will understand the responsibility of
processing claims efficiently, telling veterans not just that we
got it (the claim), but here's what we see, here's what we expect,
here's an estimate of what it's going to take'' to get a decision,
he explained.
</P>
<P>
   The VBA, which is part of the Department of Veterans Affairs,
says it spent $238 million since 1991 for hardware, software,
contractors and the salaries of VA employees.
</P>
<P>
   AP's review found that despite the spending:
</P>
<P>
   --Most information in a veteran's file is still on paper. Of 58
regional service centers, only the office where a claim was filed
has full access to case records and is able to provide a
beneficiary with a complete picture of his or her status.
</P>
<P>
   --A computer program called VETSNET, which was supposed to unite
all the VA's diverse agencies from loans to health care to
cemeteries to benefits, has achieved only limited links.
</P>
<P>
   --VBA caseworkers are saddled with antiquated programs, which
date to before the advent of Microsoft Windows. The old software
prevents them from quickly maneuvering through a veteran's file.
Unable to point-and-click with a mouse, they have to painstakingly
scroll through one screen at a time.
</P>
<P>
   About three years ago, the benefits agency announced a dramatic
drop in the time it took to process claims to 133 days. But the VA
inspector general, the agency's internal watchdog, concluded in a
1998 report that the agency had simply manipulated the numbers to
make them look better.
</P>
<P>
   Epley, the current director, said his agency is now focusing on
upgrading the computer system, improving customer service and
cutting the error rate. Also, the agency has reversed years of
personnel cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Fast claims handling would be welcome to veterans like Richard
Smith, of Arlington, Va., who said he endured a 19-year marathon
before finally winning monthly benefits some six years ago for a
Vietnam War injury.
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old subway mechanic filed his claim in 1975, but
said the VA was unable to locate his medical records. While the
records were stored by the Defense Department, it was an American
Legion counselor assisting Smith -- not VA officials -- who guessed
where the files were kept.
</P>
<P>
   ''As young soldiers we were naive,'' he said. ''We weren't
wording the claims right. I thought the people at VA were looking
out for my interest, but that wasn't the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''I should have gotten those benefits when I first filed a
claim. I was told the records were in a (personnel center) fire.
The VA said we pulled out of Vietnam so fast a lot of records were
left behind. I said, 'You have the North Vietnamese Army reading my
military records?'''
</P>
<P>
   The files were in a warehouse in San Francisco.

<HEADLINE> Gore Staffers Cited in IRS Probe  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An aide to Vice President Al Gore contacted
the Internal Revenue Service to obtain confidential tax information
after a lower level staff member was rebuffed by the tax agency the
same day, according to documents described today.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's office countered that the aides were making ''a simple
status check'' and said any duplication of calls -- by staff members
with separate jobs -- was ''inadvertent.'' Vice presidential
spokeswoman Laura Quinn identified the staffers, neither now
working for Gore, as Kumiki Gibson and Joe Eyer.
</P>
<P>
   The contacts were reported in IRS documents provided to the
Joint Committee on Taxation and described at a news conference by
the panel's executive director, Lindy Paull. She said the documents
left the impression that Eyer was Gibson's supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   The committee staff, in a bipartisan study, found no evidence
that conservative groups were audited by the IRS for their
anti-Clinton views but determined that the vice president's office
and the Treasury Department tried in separate instances to obtain
confidential information. The IRS is prohibited by law from
releasing specific taxpayer data in almost all instances -- unless a
taxpayer requests his or her own information.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore staffers were trying to get information for the vice
president that he could use in an upcoming meeting involving a
union matter. Both calls were made the same day in January 1997 and
in each case, the callers were told by the IRS that it could not
provide the information, Paull said, referring to the documents.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is the point in making the call?'' Paull said, when asked
whether Gore's office was trying to pressure the IRS to release the
data, especially with the second call.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn, Gore's communications director, said that Gibson was in
the counsel's office and Eyer -- who was not her supervisor -- was
assistant to the deputy chief of staff. Eyer left Gore's office in
April or May 1997 and Eyer left in April 1998, Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
   Both former aides have ''no specific recollection of these
specific calls,'' Quinn said. ''The theory that she (Gibson) made
the first call and a person of higher rank followed up is 100
percent incorrect.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-year study was begun after several nonprofit
conservative organizations complained they were politically
targeted for audits during the Clinton presidency. The report,
obtained Wednesday, concluded that ''high-profile tax-exempt
organizations and individuals'' received increased IRS scrutiny.
But ''no credible evidence'' was discovered that any groups ''were
selected for examination based on their political views.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides tried to obtain information about ''the status of
certain forms filed by members of a tax-exempt organization,'' the
study said. The vice president's staff members first tried to get
the information, which involved a union, from the Treasury
Department. The department directed them to the IRS in violation of
the department's rules, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   ''The White House officials then, in violation of written White
House policies, contacted directly several IRS employees ... and
attempted to secure taxpayer return information,'' the report
alleged.
</P>
<P>
   The White House policy states that ''no member of the White
House staff should have any communication of any type with the IRS
without prior approval of the (White House) counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials contended the officials who made the
contacts were authorized by the counsel's office as required by the
rules and were not seeking tax return information.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears it is a straightforward status check that was
handled appropriately by our office,'' Gore spokeswoman Melissa
Bonney Ratcliff said.
</P>
<P>
   The report did not identify the officials, and also declined to
identify the tax-exempt group because of taxpayer confidentiality
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Officials familiar with the investigation, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said evidence gathered by the committee
suggested Gore's staff made the inquiry because the vice president
was expecting to talk to union officials.
</P>
<P>
   The officials inquired about the status of an IRS decision on a
tax filing over whether certain workers should be classified as
independent contractors or employees for tax purposes, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of the 1995 Treasury inquiry could not be
determined. The report said a department official inquired about
the status of an examination of a tax-exempt organization to
several IRS officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''The IRS employees in question all recognized the impropriety
of the contacts, and made referrals'' to investigators in the
agency, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ''These types of contacts lend credence to the allegations that
the administration does intervene in IRS matters pertaining to
specific taxpayers,'' the report stated.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Department spokeswoman Michelle Smith declined to
comment Wednesday, saying she had not seen the report.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, The Associated Press disclosed that several
members of Congress, including Republicans, had requested audits of
the tax-exempt status of political foes -- based on complaints from
constituents or news stories. Among them was House Ways and Means
Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, who had requested the Joint Taxation
Committee review.
</P>
<P>
   From Jan. 1, 1994, through April 22, 1997, the IRS' national
office received nearly 500 inquiries from lawmakers relating to
tax-exempt organizations, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   While there was no evidence that the inquiries altered the
handling of any audits, the report confirmed that the IRS moved
much faster in handling such requests.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because the funding of IRS operations is dependent on the
Congress, the IRS responds more promptly to, and takes more
seriously, requests and inquiries made by members of Congress than
requests made by taxpayers,'' the report found.
</P>
<P>
   The study said the congressional requests had ''the potential
for improper influence.''
</P>
<P>
   The joint tax committee is made up of select senators and
representatives on the congressional tax-writing panels and the
staff provides the official estimates of all tax bills for the
House and Senate. It also researches various tax-related topics.

<HEADLINE> Saliva, Urine May Give Cancer Clues  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Simple saliva and urine tests could one day
replace complicated biopsies in detecting the presence of at least
some types of cancer, a new study indicates.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore report in
Friday's edition of the journal Science that cancer-related changes
in a part of human cells called mitochondria can be detected in
related body fluids.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the team was able to detect bladder cancer by
testing urine from cancer victims, and saliva showed changes
associated with head and neck cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Lung fluids also showed changes related to lung cancer, though
that test was somewhat more complicated, said Dr. David Sidransky
of the research team.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers had been studying cell changes associated with
cancer for several years, but detecting cancer-related changes in
the cell nucleus proved ''very challenging,'' Sidransky said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   When they tried looking for changes in mitochondria instead,
they were surprised. ''We never imagined that the mitochondria
would have as many mutations as we found,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mitochondria are parts of human cells that provide energy for
the cell. Like the nucleus they contain DNA, the complex set of
instructions for the cell. But unlike the cell nucleus, which gets
DNA from each parent, mitochondria are inherited only from the
mother.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have known that mitochondria were important in
cancer, as far as giving energy to the tumor, Sidransky said.
</P>
<P>
   ''To our surprise we found that about two-thirds of all the
cancers we looked at had mitochondrial mutations,'' he said.
Mitochondrial changes didn't occur in all tumors, he noted, ''but
when they are there we can find it.''
</P>
<P>
   The next thing is to perfect the tests for use in the general
population, which could take six months to a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he added, the team wants to extend their research
to a much larger population. Their paper was based on tests in
about 15 patients each with bladder, lung and head and neck cancer.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Overpaid for Spare Parts  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN M. DONNELLY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon paid nearly triple the fair and
reasonable price for a part that keeps the propellers on C-130
Hercules transport planes from icing over, according to government
officials familiar with an internal military audit.
</P>
<P>
   The audit has not been publicly released. But Robert Lieberman,
the Pentagon's assistant inspector general for audits, described
its basic findings -- that the military is paying too much for many
aviation spares -- at a congressional hearing today.
</P>
<P>
   However, Stan Soloway, the Pentagon's deputy undersecretary for
acquisition reform, told the panel the audit is ''questionable.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not at all convinced the prices are unreasonable and
unfair,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Defense Department agency last year bought 1,803 ''propeller
blade heaters'' from United Technology's Hamilton Standard -- now
Hamilton Sundstrand -- at a cost of roughly $555 apiece, when the
fair price was closer to $200 each, according to two other
government officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The
Defense Logistics Agency, which runs military stockpiles, managed
the contract.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the military paid just over $1 million for the
parts, instead of about $365,000, said the officials.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before the House Government Reform subcommittee on
government management, Lieberman called the propeller heater prices
an ''egregious'' example of overpricing. He did not go into detail.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee, chaired by Rep. Steve Horn, R-Calif., is
looking at a list of issues about Pentagon spending.
</P>
<P>
   Under a new way of doing business adopted in the 1990s, the
Pentagon is paying companies not just for parts but for providing a
range of services the military used to do itself, from supply
management to inventory to warehousing, the Pentagon's Soloway
said. The arrangement is, on balance, saving the government money
even if some parts cost more, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That would be fine if you really need those services,''
Lieberman said, but in many cases, the government doesn't need a
''middle man'' to manage spares. Notwithstanding Soloway's defense
of the arrangements, Lieberman pointed out, the Pentagon has
already agreed that the arrangement needs to be changed.
</P>
<P>
   Soloway said the audit report, which remains ''for official use
only'' within the Pentagon, ''is a matter that has been under
significant discussion and debate between us and the inspector
general for some months now.''

<HEADLINE> Nissan USA President Stepping Down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMYRNA, Tenn. (AP) -- Jerry Benefield, Nissan USA's president and
chief executive officer for the past 12 years, announced his
retirement Thursday, saying he leaves the company in good shape and
eyeing more models.
</P>
<P>
   Benefield, 60, will retire April 1 and be succeeded by Dan
Gaudette, senior vice president of operations of U.S. manufacturing
for Nissan North America Inc.
</P>
<P>
   He described the future of the company as ''very bright.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Our volumes are increasing. I think job security is in good
shape and in the next three or four years, we will add volume and
models,'' he said in a brief telephone interview. He did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Benefield, as a member of the company's startup team, was
instrumental in building Nissan Motor Manufacturing Corp. USA's
first U.S. manufacturing venture and hiring the plant's first
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Benefield departs at a time when strong sales of the Nissan
Xterra are expected to boost production of the sports utility
vehicle 22 percent next year and could produce more jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a great product, even more popular than we expected.
We're at the maximum capacity now and hope to raise that to more
than 100,000,'' he said. It's 80,000 now.
</P>
<P>
   The Xterra has reinvigorated Nissan's sales, becoming one of the
hottest-selling foreign cars in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan Motor Co., the second-largest Japanese automaker, has
announced plans to slash costs worldwide by consolidating offices,
attrition and layoffs. Nissan Motor Manufacturing Corp. USA is
being consolidated into Nissan North America on April 1 as part of
the cost-cutting.
</P>
<P>
   Separately Thursday, Nissan Motor Co. announced it plans to
appoint Carlos Ghosn, the onetime Renault executive who is leading
the Japanese automaker's restructuring drive, as its president.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Brushes Aside NRA Rhetoric  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today praised the House for
taking ''a small but significant step'' toward passing gun
legislation. He brushed aside an accusation by the National Rifle
Association leader that he has the blood of a murdered coach on his
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Before heading to lunch with the House speaker, Clinton told
reporters that his administration is seeking extra money from
Congress to bolster enforcement, but also has tried to leave gun
cases with local, rather than federal, prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what we've tried to do is the right course,'' Clinton
said. As for NRA criticisms that federal authorities have failed to
pursue criminals whose gun purchases are thwarted by background
checks, Clinton said:
</P>
<P>
   ''It's truly ironic that the NRA is now criticizing us for not
throwing everybody in jail that fails a Brady background check. If
it had been up to them, we wouldn't be doing these background
checks.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said he was pleased by Wednesday's House vote
calling for a conference committee to set a meeting to iron out a
compromise gun bill, ''after eight months and other senseless
shootings.'' He cautioned lawmakers to remember that getting a gun
bill passed will be a long battle, but said it was brave of them to
''say no to the name-calling and no to the threats'' of the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton declined to address NRA Executive Vice President Wayne
LaPierre's latest comment that his hands have the blood of a
murdered coach on them. ''Getting into a personal spat with Mr.
LaPierre about tactics I don't think any American appreciates, and
any American can see through, is not worth doing.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on ABC Wednesday night, LaPierre responded to
Clinton's call that LaPierre ''look into the eyes'' of parents
whose children were killed by gun violence by saying: ''Has he
looked into the eyes of Ricky Byrdsong's family? Because that blood
is on his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House reacted angrily to that statement. ''Just when
you think a human being couldn't go any lower, Wayne LaPierre and
the NRA found a way,'' Lockhart said. ''This kind of sick rhetoric
should stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about LaPierre's accusation and his weekend comment that
Clinton was ''willing to accept a certain level of killing to
further his political agenda,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said
today, ''I have heard an awful lot in the last seven years, but
that's about the worst rhetoric that I have heard. I don't know of
any president that has worked so hard to make this a less violent
nation, a more peaceful nation, a nation where its children can
grow in a strong, peaceful, safe, constructive way.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrdsong, a former Northwestern University basketball coach, was
shot to death last summer in a two-state shooting spree in which
one other person died and nine were wounded. Authorities determined
later that the white supremacist responsible for the shootings had
failed a Brady law background check but had not been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said federal officials were not aware of the killer's
background check until six days after Byrdsong's death, a fact he
said LaPierre ''knows full well.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart's comments came a day after gun-control advocates won a
rare -- though symbolic -- victory in Congress. The House, in a
nonbinding 218-205 vote, urged House and Senate negotiators to meet
within two weeks to work out a compromise on long-stalled gun
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Republican leadership in Congress should do two things
now: Stand up and publicly repudiate this, then push aside the NRA
and get moving on commonsense gun legislation,'' Lockhart said.
''Let the will of the House, not the will of the NRA, rule the
day.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton has increased pressure on Congress to toughen
gun-safety laws, the NRA -- which contends the administration will
not enforce existing laws -- has increasingly personalized its
disagreement with the president. In a weekend interview, LaPierre
asserted that Clinton was ''willing to accept a certain level of
killing to further his political agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted last year to institute 72-hour background
checks on gun show sales, but the House rejected that provision in
favor of a 24-hour wait, and gun control has been on the back
burner since then.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators from the House and Senate are supposed to resolve
differences between the two bills, which also contain a number of
other provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the House vote Wednesday, 12 female members of
Congress made an emotional appeal at the White House for their
colleagues to move on the legislation. On the vote, 46 Republicans
voted for the resolution and 32 Democrats opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who has clinched the
Republican presidential nomination, said he might favor a law
requiring every new firearm to include technology that would allow
the weapons to be fired only when matched to the owner's
fingerprint. And he told reporters he is willing to sign a law
requiring that trigger locks be sold with all handguns, although he
doubts it would reduce gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, New York Gov. George Pataki called for a series of
gun-control measures in his state that include making trigger locks
mandatory, taking ballistic ''fingerprints'' of guns, requiring
dealers and manufacturers to send to a state lab a test bullet and
shell casing from every handgun they sell in the state, raising the
age for handgun ownership from 18 to 21 and requiring instant
background checks of gun buyers at flea markets and gun shows.

<HEADLINE> HMO Accused of Underpaying Doctors  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The American Medical Association has filed a
class-action lawsuit against HMO giant United Healthcare Corp. for
reducing payments to thousands of New York doctors by using invalid
data to determine reimbursement rates.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, patients have been forced to pay higher doctors
bills to make up the difference, the AMA says.
</P>
<P>
   The civil suit, filed Wednesday in state court in Manhattan,
seeks unspecified compensation, including punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   AMA Trustee Dr. Donald Palmisano said the physician's group
believes the problem of HMOs underpaying doctors is happening
nationwide with several major health maintenance organizations.
''Insurance companies play by their own rules without regard to
patients or the legitimate cost it takes to care for them,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many insurance company contracts let them pay doctors using the
lowest amount based on three factors: the doctor's actual charge;
what the doctor usually charges; and the ''reasonable and customary
charge,'' which is determined by what other doctors in the same
specialty in the same city charge for the service.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit, the AMA says United relied on data provided by
the insurance trade group the Health Insurance Association of
America to establish the ''usual'' charge for services. The AMA
says the data is invalid.
</P>
<P>
   The suit against United is the second time the AMA has sued a
large HMO in as many months. In February, the AMA sued Aetna Inc.
in Georgia for failing to pay doctors promptly.
</P>
<P>
   Palmisano, a New Orleans surgeon, said the recent suits are part
of the AMA's new strategy of getting more aggressive in pursuing
physicians' rights against HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   United Healthcare officials did not return calls seeking a
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, United won praise from the medical community after it
said it would no longer overrule doctors seeking approval for
certain tests, treatments or hospitalizations.

<HEADLINE> Helms Invites U.N. Officials To D.C.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Jesse Helms, chairman of the Foreign
Relations Committee, is inviting U.N. Security Council members to
visit the Senate on March 30, making good on an invitation he
extended when he spoke to the world body in January.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be our pleasure to repay your hospitality and to
continue the important dialogue we began together in New York,''
said Helms, R-N.C., and Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the
committee's senior Democrat, in letters to council members.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how many of the council's 15 members would take
up Helms and Biden's offer. But on the Security Council's informal
calendar for the month, the words ''Washington trip'' and a
question mark are penciled in.
</P>
<P>
   Helms' Jan. 21 address was the first ever by a U.S. lawmaker to
the council. Although cordial in tone and calling for ''a new
beginning,'' Helms laced his remarks with sharp criticism of the
international organization. Delegates reacted coolly to the list of
alleged U.N. shortcomings and failures.
</P>
<P>
   According to the invitation, the visit would include a tour of
the Capitol, a discussion of the history of the Senate, a luncheon
and ''roundtable discussions on U.N. reform and peacekeeping'' in
the committee's hearing room.
</P>
<P>
   Helms and Biden wrote to the current council president, Anwarul
Karim Chowdhury of Bangladesh, and other members of the council.
The council has five permanent members -- the United States, Russia,
Britain, France and China -- and 10 elected by the General Assembly
for two-year terms.

<HEADLINE> Ireland Grows as Movie Setting  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- It's that time of year for a few pints of
stout, the wearing of the green -- and a bit of blarney on the movie
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Just in time for St. Patrick's Day on Friday, two movies about
Ireland are in theaters, ''Agnes Browne'' and ''The Closer You
Get'' -- the latest offbeat films catering to American audiences'
interest in all things Irish.
</P>
<P>
   The last 10 years or so have brought a string of Irish-themed
movies to U.S. theaters, dealing with politics and rebellion
(''Michael Collins,'' ''In the Name of the Father''), myth and
legend (''Into the West,'' ''The Secret of Roan Inish''), music
(''The Commitments,'' ''Hear My Song'') and the oddities of Irish
families (''Dancing at Lughnasa,'' ''The Snapper'').
</P>
<P>
   ''There seems to be an enormous amount coming out of Ireland
these days. Dare I say a glut?'' said Anjelica Huston, director and
star of ''Agnes Browne,'' the story of an impoverished Irish widow
coping with seven children. ''There's a lot of good stuff from
Ireland these days, very much like the wave of films that came out
of Britain in the '60s.''
</P>
<P>
   The actress lived her early years in Ireland and starred in the
last film by her father, legendary director John Huston, an
adaptation of James Joyce's ''The Dead,'' about a lively Dublin
holiday gathering and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Some Irish movies have become breakout hits, such as ''Waking
Ned Devine'' and ''The Crying Game,'' which received five Academy
Award nominations, including best picture, and a screenplay Oscar
for writer-director Neil Jordan in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland has caught Hollywood's interest in decades past with
such classics as John Ford's ''The Informer'' and ''The Quiet
Man,'' perhaps the quintessential St. Patrick's Day flick. ''The
Quiet Man'' starred John Wayne as an American boxer who returns to
the Irish town of his birth and takes up with the locals, including
hot-tempered Maureen O'Hara.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're looking for an actress who represents Ireland,
Maureen O'Hara would be it,'' said Sean O'Malley, a member of the
Sons of Erin of Westfield, Mass. ''A beautiful woman, she's got
that temper, and certainly the fiery red hair. And playing with
John Wayne, who's all-American, I think in anybody's mind, you
can't beat it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Irish-born Jordan, whose other movies about Ireland include
''Michael Collins'' and ''The Butcher Boy,'' is among a cadre of
directors who have sparked Hollywood's current interest in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Others include Jim Sheridan, who co-produced ''Agnes Browne''
and directed ''My Left Foot'' and ''The Boxer,'' Alan Parker,
director of ''The Commitments'' and ''Angela's Ashes,'' and Stephen
Frears, who made ''The Snapper'' and ''The Van.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeding interest in the island has been news coverage of peace
efforts in Northern Ireland after 30 years of ''the troubles'' over
British rule.
</P>
<P>
   Frank McCourt's Pulitzer-winning memoir ''Angela's Ashes'' and
Irish fiction by such authors as Roddy Doyle (''The Commitments,''
''A Star Called Henry'') also have contributed. And music by Irish
performers such as U2, the Pogues, Van Morrison and the Cranberries
has helped drive Ireland's renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we're the flavor of the month now,'' said Phyllis
Towey Brugnolotti, who grew up in Ireland and now is assistant
librarian at the American Irish Historical Society in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   When she went to college in London in the 1950s, ''it was very
bad to be Irish. It was the lowest level of society,'' Brugnolotti
said. She said it was a different story last summer, when she
visited England and a woman overheard her Irish accent at a
bookstore in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   ''This woman said, 'You're Irish, aren't you? You're so
lucky,''' Brugnolotti said. ''It was funny, because we never
thought of ourselves as people to be envied.''
</P>
<P>
   Both ''Agnes Browne'' and ''The Closer You Get'' deal
good-humoredly with some of the hard knocks of Irish life.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Closer You Get'' involves a group of lonely bachelors on
Ireland's isolated west coast who advertise for brides in an
American newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Huston's title character in ''Agnes Browne'' comes to grips with
life on the dole after her husband's death and a tragedy involving
her best friend.
</P>
<P>
   The movie has a dreamy ending involving Agnes' obsession with
seeing singer Tom Jones in concert.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a fairy-tale quality,'' Huston said. ''A little
epiphany at the end.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 377.57; Nasdaq Takes Drop  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow industrials soared as much as 450 points
today as blue-chip stocks attracted money that is leaving the
technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks, which earlier fell steeply enough to drive
the Nasdaq composite index into what many on Wall Street consider a
''correction,'' stabilized and were modestly lower at midafternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In heavy afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 377.57, or 3.7 percent, at 10,508.98,
extending a 320-point gain on Wednesday that represented its
biggest surge in 17 months. If today's gain holds it would be the
second largest single-point gain ever for the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier trading, the Dow was up as much as 452 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index was down 10.79 at 4,571.83, having
clawed back from an earlier loss of 127 points. The Nasdaq had
plunged 465 points over the past three sessions, bringing it more
than 9 percent below its Friday record of 5,048.62. At its low
point today, the index was down 11.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Market watchers consider a loss of 10 percent a correction,
which signifies a sudden reversal of a market trend but doesn't
necessarily mark a long-term change. Many analysts believed the
Nasdaq, which had risen 24 percent in the year to date, was overdue
for a correction.
</P>
<P>
   Broad market indicators were mostly higher today. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was up 43.12 at 1,435.26 and the Russell 2000
index of smaller companies rose 0.41 to 559.28.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors were snapping up shares of companies
that have been driven well below their previous highs in recent
months. Investors' willingness to dump blue-chip stocks in favor of
technology stocks pushed the Dow into a correction in mid-February,
and the index has struggled until this week.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a wide range of stocks led the Dow higher. American
Express rose 11 7/16 to 144 5/16, Johnson &AMP; Johnson rose 3[ to 80
1/16, and 3M rose 4 15/16 to 87 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   Also, General Electric rose 4\ to 137} and J.P. Morgan gained 8]
to 124~. Many of those shares have been beaten down in recent weeks
as investors poured money into technology stocks, and are now
enticing investors as relative bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investors sold Nasdaq stocks that have performed best
in the year to date. Dell fell 1 3/16 to 52{ and Cisco Systems fell
{ to 128[.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of these high-growth stocks had gotten to such extreme
valuations,'' said Matt Finn, chief investment officer of the
growth and income group at Evergreen Funds in Boston. ''They were
due to come down.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue-chip stocks rose even after the Labor Department's Producer
Price Index showed that wholesale prices surged 1 percent in
February, the largest gain in nearly 10 years, as gasoline, home
heating oil and other energy costs rose.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation figures, including the Consumer Price Index due for
release on Friday, are sure to be closely watched by the Federal
Reserve as it weighs whether still higher interest rates are needed
to cool the economy. In a continuing effort to keep inflation at
bay, the Fed has raised rates four times since last June, and it
meets again Tuesday, when investors are expecting a fifth rate
hike.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors were heartened by the fact that the ''core''
rate of inflation at the wholesale level, which excludes the
volatile energy and food categories, matched expectations with a
0.3 percent gain in today's report.
</P>
<P>
   ''The core rate was in line with what we expected,'' said Finn.
''The Fed is on its way to taking the edge off inflation, and it's
looking like they aren't going to have to be excessive to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The bond market improved modestly, lending support to stocks.
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.04 percent from
6.07 percent late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-1 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.03 billion shares
at midafternoon, well ahead of Wednesday's heavy pace.
</P>
<P>
   Volatility was magnified because Friday is a ''triple-witching''
session, a once-a-quarter event when contracts on stock options,
index options, and index futures all expire. Those expirations
generally cause increased volatility on Wall Street.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Millionaires Double in 5 Years  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- There are twice as many millionaires in
America today as there were five years ago, but the booming economy
and rising number of stock market investors can mean a lot more
headaches when tax time rolls around.
</P>
<P>
   The number of U.S. households with a total net worth over $1
million -- not including their primary home -- has reached 7.1
million, compared with 3.45 million in 1994, according to the
Spectrem Group research firm. And the number of federal income tax
returns with adjusted gross income of $1 million or more topped
144,000 in 1997, compared with about 70,000 in 1994, the IRS says.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you get into a cab and the driver is telling you what
he's buying and selling, you know times have changed,'' said Joanne
E. Johnson, an attorney and wealth strategist at J.P. Morgan in New
York. ''The unwary can get caught at this tax filing time.''
</P>
<P>
   This unprecedented wealth can push people into much higher
income tax brackets and force some to pay capital gains or
alternative minimum taxes for the first time. Others with over
$150,000 in adjusted gross income may have to begin making
estimated quarterly payments to the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   And even if they are young, wealthy taxpayers should start
making estate plans to avoid a much bigger tax bite later -- as much
as 55 percent under current law.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our new millionaires don't realize they are going to be hit
with estate taxes they didn't anticipate initially,'' Johnson said.
''Everything you own is taxable in your estate.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, taxpayers have a limited number of ways to reduce
their income tax bill from 1999, which is due on April 17. They
should maximize deductions, as always, and they still can
contribute up to $2,000 in an individual retirement account.
</P>
<P>
   But there are many moves taxpayers can make in 2000 to improve
the picture for next tax season. Here are some recommendations from
J.P. Morgan and the Deloitte &AMP; Touche and KPMG accounting firms:
</P>
<P>
   --Transfer stock options into a trust when they have a relatively
low value. When the trust exercises the options at a higher value,
the taxpayer has to pay income taxes but only at the original value
and the trust keeps 100 percent of the proceeds. Taxpayers should
get an independent appraisal of the stock's original value to back
up their claim.
</P>
<P>
   --Maximize tax-deferred contributions to retirement plans -- one
way is to contribute corporate directors' fees and claim
self-employed status -- and contribute to any accounts an employer
may allow for pre-tax dollars used for medical and child care
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   --Make the most of any stock losses. Taxpayers can write off
capital losses to offset capital gains, but mutual fund
distributions are considered dividends and don't count. Beware of
the ''wash-sale'' rule, which prohibits taxpayers from selling a
security to create a paper loss and then purchasing it right back.
</P>
<P>
   --Consider purchasing municipal bonds. Coupon payments from these
bonds are exempt from federal income tax, and the interest is also
exempt from tax in the state in which the bond was issued.
</P>
<P>
   --Make more charitable contributions, including stock. The
charity gets the value of the stock, while the taxpayer making the
donation gets a deduction based on its fair market value subject to
some income limits.
</P>
<P>
   --Be careful about cashing in stock to pay for needs such as home
remodeling, children's education or a vacation. The value of the
stock may eventually grow much higher if left alone and it could be
more advantageous to simply borrow the money.
</P>
<P>
   On the estate tax front, J.P. Morgan's Johnson said taxpayers
should consider making money transfers now, to take advantage of an
annual $10,000 exclusion if the money is given to a child, directly
to a school or health facility, or is used for medical bills or a
child's tuition.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a living person can transfer up to $675,000 this
year -- or $1.35 million if the spouse joins in -- without triggering
the estate tax that would occur on those same assets after death.
This ''unified credit'' will eventually rise to $1 million for an
individual in 2006, and $2 million for a couple.
</P>
<P>
   This move would save estate taxes not only on assets given away
but also on the future appreciated value of those assets. The same
is true of individual retirement accounts: If they are withdrawn
early and some funds given away, it will save in both estate taxes
and income taxes that apply after death.

<HEADLINE> Replica of 1800s emigrant ship to tour U.S., but Albany visit indoubt  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS CAROLA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- This city's deep-rooted Irish-American
community thought it had another reason to celebrate St. Patrick's
Day: the arrival later this year of a full-size replica of a ship
that brought Irish immigrants to America.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, some of Albany's Irish are seeing red as they don their
green.
</P>
<P>
   The brouhaha stems from an itinerary change that threatens the
scheduled visit by the Jeanie Johnston. The 150-foot-long,
triple-masted barque is fashioned after a storied ship of the same
name that carried Irish potato famine survivors to North America in
the mid-1800s.
</P>
<P>
   The replica ship was originally scheduled to spend four days
docked on the Hudson River in Albany in mid-June. School field
trips, a parade and an Irish music festival were some of the
activities planned in conjunction with the ship's expected four-day
stay in New York's capital.
</P>
<P>
   But the Tralee, Ireland-based organizers who built the ship and
set its 27-city tour schedule have bumped the Albany arrival to
early November, when upstate weather is chancy, at best. They blame
shipbuilding delays for the change, and feel students will have a
better opportunity to visit the ship in the fall as opposed to the
final days of the school year.
</P>
<P>
   To the man responsible for landing Albany a coveted berth on the
Jeanie's tight schedule, the change threatens to wipe out three
years of planning for he event.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of the things we had planned -- a festival, a dockside
Mass, an Irish famine exhibit -- all those things are of
questionable value now to the overall program,'' said an angry
Joseph Dolan, chairman of the Irish American Heritage Museum in
East Durham, 25 miles south of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's the difference between June and November? Maybe none in
Ireland, but in Albany, New York ...'' he said Thursday. ''We have
all these eggs in the basket and now they're being trodden on.''
</P>
<P>
   Dolan said Albany's host committee is considering canceling the
Jeanie's visit here. A decision will be made after the dozens of
Albany Irish-Americans who ''jumped into this headfirst'' have a
chance to meet, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jeanie Johnston is a $7 million project funded by
international bodies such as the European Union and the U.S.-led
International Fund for Ireland and by corporations with plants in
Ireland, chiefly Dublin-based Elan Corp. pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   The original ship made 16 voyages to North America in between
1847 and 1858. It was notable for never losing a passenger to
disease, unlike other Irish emigrant ships of the era that were
dubbed ''coffin ships.''
</P>
<P>
   The replica ship was originally scheduled to sail from Ireland
in mid-April. Delays have pushed back its departure date to May 7.
It's first port of call is Washington, D.C., on June 7, followed by
a summer and fall tour of major ports in the Northeast, Canada and
the Great Lakes, including Buffalo in September.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan, a retired state corrections official, said the Jeanie's
visit had the potential to be Albany's biggest Irish-themed event
ever. In a city of 100,000 where nearly a third claimed at least
some Irish heritage in the 1990 census, that's saying a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Albany prides itself on supporting all things Irish, whether
they be Celtic music festivals, homegrown writers such as William
Kennedy or Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, who received a hero's
welcome here during visits in 1995 and '98.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ten years ago if you did an Irish festival in Albany, you'd
get 200 of the loyal Irish families,'' said Kevin McKrell, a
musician who got his start singing in Albany numerous Irish bars.
''Now any Irish-related event is packed around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Dolan doubts that will be the case if the Jeanie Johnston heads
up the Hudson in November. One of the purposes of bringing the ship
to Albany was to link its visit with classroom lessons on the
potato famine and Irish immigration, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Albany's docks don't include facilities where people can
wait in line protected from the elements, Dolan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you ask 8- and 9-year-olds to stand on the dock in Albany
in November?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Turlough McConnell, who's coordinating the ship's itinerary,
said Albany and the other cities were aware that the scheduling was
contingent on the Jeanie being built on time and the vagaries of a
trans-Atlantic voyage.
</P>
<P>
   And, he added, much larger port cities are being bypassed while
Albany -- a 300-mile roundtrip from Manhattan -- was scheduled from
the start.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to be everywhere, but it's only one ship. It's not a
fleet,'' McConnell said. ''There are huge ports that the ship won't
be able to go to.''
</P>
<P>
   McConnell said the schedule could be changed yet again. But with
the Jeanie committed to appear at tall-ship events in New York City
and Boston in July, it's unlikely Albany will see the ship in a
warm-weather month, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Albany is still very much in the plan for the millennium
voyage,'' he said. ''If the date doesn't work for Albany, it's
Albany's prerogative to cancel the visit.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Promotes New Gun Laws  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today praised the House for
taking ''a small but significant step'' toward passing gun
legislation. He brushed aside an accusation by the National Rifle
Association leader that he has the blood of a murdered coach on his
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Before heading to lunch with the House speaker, Clinton told
reporters that his administration is seeking extra money from
Congress to bolster enforcement, but also has tried to leave gun
cases with local, rather than federal, prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what we've tried to do is the right course,'' Clinton
said. As for NRA criticisms that federal authorities have failed to
pursue criminals whose gun purchases are thwarted by background
checks, Clinton said:
</P>
<P>
   ''It's truly ironic that the NRA is now criticizing us for not
throwing everybody in jail that fails a Brady background check. If
it had been up to them, we wouldn't be doing these background
checks.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said he was pleased by Wednesday's House vote
calling for a conference committee to set a meeting to iron out a
compromise gun bill, ''after eight months and other senseless
shootings.'' He cautioned lawmakers to remember that getting a gun
bill passed will be a long battle, but said it was brave of them to
''say no to the name-calling and no to the threats'' of the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton declined to address NRA Executive Vice President Wayne
LaPierre's latest comment that his hands have the blood of a
murdered coach on them. ''Getting into a personal spat with Mr.
LaPierre about tactics I don't think any American appreciates, and
any American can see through, is not worth doing.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on ABC Wednesday night, LaPierre responded to
Clinton's call that LaPierre ''look into the eyes'' of parents
whose children were killed by gun violence by saying: ''Has he
looked into the eyes of Ricky Byrdsong's family? Because that blood
is on his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House reacted angrily to that statement. ''Just when
you think a human being couldn't go any lower, Wayne LaPierre and
the NRA found a way,'' Lockhart said. ''This kind of sick rhetoric
should stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about LaPierre's accusation and his weekend comment that
Clinton was ''willing to accept a certain level of killing to
further his political agenda,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said
today, ''I have heard an awful lot in the last seven years, but
that's about the worst rhetoric that I have heard. I don't know of
any president that has worked so hard to make this a less violent
nation, a more peaceful nation, a nation where its children can
grow in a strong, peaceful, safe, constructive way.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrdsong, a former Northwestern University basketball coach, was
shot to death last summer in a two-state shooting spree in which
one other person died and nine were wounded. Authorities determined
later that the white supremacist responsible for the shootings had
failed a Brady law background check but had not been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said federal officials were not aware of the killer's
background check until six days after Byrdsong's death, a fact he
said LaPierre ''knows full well.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart's comments came a day after gun-control advocates won a
rare -- though symbolic -- victory in Congress. The House, in a
nonbinding 218-205 vote, urged House and Senate negotiators to meet
within two weeks to work out a compromise on long-stalled gun
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Republican leadership in Congress should do two things
now: Stand up and publicly repudiate this, then push aside the NRA
and get moving on commonsense gun legislation,'' Lockhart said.
''Let the will of the House, not the will of the NRA, rule the
day.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton has increased pressure on Congress to toughen
gun-safety laws, the NRA -- which contends the administration will
not enforce existing laws -- has increasingly personalized its
disagreement with the president. In a weekend interview, LaPierre
asserted that Clinton was ''willing to accept a certain level of
killing to further his political agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted last year to institute 72-hour background
checks on gun show sales, but the House rejected that provision in
favor of a 24-hour wait, and gun control has been on the back
burner since then.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators from the House and Senate are supposed to resolve
differences between the two bills, which also contain a number of
other provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the House vote Wednesday, 12 female members of
Congress made an emotional appeal at the White House for their
colleagues to move on the legislation. On the vote, 46 Republicans
voted for the resolution and 32 Democrats opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who has clinched the
Republican presidential nomination, said he might favor a law
requiring every new firearm to include technology that would allow
the weapons to be fired only when matched to the owner's
fingerprint. And he told reporters he is willing to sign a law
requiring that trigger locks be sold with all handguns, although he
doubts it would reduce gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, New York Gov. George Pataki called for a series of
gun-control measures in his state that include making trigger locks
mandatory, taking ballistic ''fingerprints'' of guns, requiring
dealers and manufacturers to send to a state lab a test bullet and
shell casing from every handgun they sell in the state, raising the
age for handgun ownership from 18 to 21 and requiring instant
background checks of gun buyers at flea markets and gun shows.

<HEADLINE> Smits Graces School Opening  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Jimmy Smits shouted ''Viva la educacion'' as he
snipped a ribbon at the ceremonial opening of a charter school, but
some students weren't sure just who he was.
</P>
<P>
   Though many know Smits as the star of prime-time serials ''NYPD
Blue'' and ''LA Law,'' some middle-schoolers were puzzled about the
identity of the guy with the goatee, hoop earring and stretch limo.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wasn't he in 'The Godfather?''' one youngster whispered.
</P>
<P>
   Smits, in South Florida to promote his upcoming film, ''Price of
Glory,'' about a Latin boxing family, offered a pep talk Wednesday
at the ASPIRA Youth Leadership Charter School in North Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Founded by a Puerto Rican woman, ASPIRA encourages minority
students. Smits won a scholarship from the organization when he was
a struggling college student in Brooklyn in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds from the film's Miami premiere went to ASPIRA, among
other charities.

<HEADLINE> Euro Bank Raises Lending Rate  </HEADLINE>
By HANS GREIMEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Taking action for the second time this
year to stem inflation in the 11 euro countries, the European
Central Bank raised its key interest rate Thursday by a
quarter-point to 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the European Union announced that inflation
hit 2 percent for January -- the upper limit for inflation according
to the ECB's own rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''Economic conditions and prospects for the euro area appear to
be better at present than at any other time in the past decade,''
the governing board said in a statement released after Thursday's
meeting. ''At the same time, upside risk to price stability were
seen as a reason for vigilance.''
</P>
<P>
   The ECB said the resurgent European economy and high oil prices
were fueling inflation, but also acknowledged that the weak euro
was prodding prices upward as well.
</P>
<P>
   A weak currency can spur inflation by making imports more
expensive, and the sliding euro has been a concern since it fell to
a new low of 93.90 cents just before the last ECB meeting March 2.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said the central bank held off changing rates earlier
this month, in order to avoid giving the impression it was trying
to bolster the currency, a move seen as damaging the reputation of
the year-old bank.
</P>
<P>
   But ECB President Wim Duisenberg had made it clear then that the
bank was eyeing a rate hike, saying that ''there can be no doubt in
anybody's mind what direction monetary policy will take in the very
near future.''
</P>
<P>
   Since bottoming out, the euro has largely stabilized in a range
of 96-97 cents -- making it easier for the ECB to raise rates
without being seen as a slave to currency fluctuations, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now they can say the rate hike has nothing to do with short
term adjustments for the euro and is in line with the long term
goals outlined two weeks ago, that is, concern about inflation,''
said Stefan Schneider, chief euro analyst at Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Raising interest rates tends to cool off an overheated economy
by making it more expensive to borrow money. But it also has the
added effect of buoying the local currency because it increases
returns on investments in euro-denominated bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were largely unfazed by Thursday's rate increase,
having already factored it into the market. Stock markets rose 1
percent in London and Paris, and 2.3 percent in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The euro currency barely moved after the rate announcement
Thursday, heading slightly upward but then settling back. In late
trading in New York, the euro was at 97.13 cents, slightly below
the 97.15 cents in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The ECB also changed Thursday two other key rates which form the
floor and ceiling for the money market -- the overnight deposit rate
and the marginal lending rate. They were also raised by 0.25
percentage point, to 2.5 percent for the deposit rate and 4.5
percent for marginal lending.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's last rate increase was Feb. 3, pushing its
refinancing rate by a quarter percentage point to 3.25 percent. The
refinancing rate is the interest the ECB charges commercial banks
for buying back short-term securities when banks need cash.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 412.94; Nasdaq Takes Drop  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow industrials rocketed higher Thursday,
rising as much as 452 points in heavy trading, as more
bargain-hunting among ''old'' economy issues helped extend sharp
gains for blue-chip stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-focused Nasdaq Stock Market, which this week was
swooning sharply from record heights, managed a modest gain.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 412.94 points, or by 4.1
percent, at 10,544.35 in afternoon trading, adding to Wednesday's
320-point surge. At one point Thursday, it was up 452.34, or 4.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's best-known indicator was on track to set a record
for the sharpest one-day Dow point gain ever. The record gain --
380.53 points -- was set Sept. 8, 1998. But even with its
unprecedented two-day rally, the Dow remained 10.1 percent below
its Jan. 14 record of 11,722.98.
</P>
<P>
   Investors' willingness to dump blue-chip stocks in favor of
technology stocks pushed the Dow into a ''correction'' in
mid-February, and the index has struggled until this week.
</P>
<P>
   But traders are once more paying attention to old-line
businesses, and companies like American Express, Johnson &AMP; Johnson
and 3M were leading the Dow higher Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, which closed last Friday at a record
5,048.62, was up 29.51 at 4,612.13 in afternoon trading after being
down as much as 127 earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   At the depths of its decline Thursday, the Nasdaq was down 11.8
percent from last Friday. With its recovery later in the day
Thursday, its decline was 8.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A drop of more than 10 percent is considered a signal of a
correction, or downturn in a rising market.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of these high-growth stocks had gotten to such extreme
valuations,'' said Matt Finn, chief investment officer of the
growth and income group at Evergreen Funds in Boston. ''They were
due to come down.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue-chip shares rose even after the Labor Department's Producer
Price Index showed that wholesale prices surged 1 percent in
February, the largest gain in nearly 10 years, as gasoline, home
heating oil and other energy costs rose.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors were heartened by the fact that the ''core''
rate of inflation at the wholesale level, which excludes the
volatile energy and food categories, matched expectations with a
0.3 percent gain in Thursday's report.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation figures, including the Consumer Price Index due for
release on Friday, are sure to be closely watched by the Federal
Reserve as it weighs whether still higher interest rates are needed
to cool the economy. In a continuing effort to keep inflation at
bay, the Fed has raised rates four times since last June, and it
meets again Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Volatility Thursday was magnified because it is the eve of a
''triple-witching'' session, a once-a-quarter event when contracts
on stock options, index options, and index futures all expire.
Those expirations generally cause increased gyrations on Wall
Street.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 433.73; Nasdaq Takes Drop  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow industrials rocketed higher Thursday as
more bargain-hunting among ''old'' economy issues helped extend
sharp gains for blue-chip stocks.
</P>
<P>
   And in a major reversal of roles, the strength in industrial
stocks began spreading to technology stocks. The technology-laden
Nasdaq composite index, which fell steeply enough in the morning
session to tumble into what many on Wall Street consider a
''correction,'' turned sharply higher by late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow
Jones industrial average was up 433.73, or 4.3 percent, at
10,565.14, adding to a 320-point gain on Wednesday that represented
its biggest surge in 17 months. Wall Street's best-known indicator
was on track surpass the record for a one-day point gain, the
380.53 of Sept. 8, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index was up 75.82 at 4,658.44, having
clawed back from an earlier loss of 127 points. The Nasdaq had
plunged 465 points over the past three sessions, bringing it more
than 9 percent below its Friday record of 5,048.62. At its low
point today, the index was down 11.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Market watchers consider a loss of 10 percent a correction,
which signifies a sudden reversal of a market trend but doesn't
necessarily mark a long-term change. Many analysts believed the
Nasdaq, which had risen 24 percent in the year to date, was overdue
for a correction.
</P>
<P>
   Broader market indicators were also higher today. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was up 55.23 at 1,447.37 and the Russell 2000
index of smaller companies rose 6.85 to 565.72.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors were snapping up shares of companies
that have been driven well below their previous highs in recent
months. Investors' willingness to dump blue-chip stocks in favor of
technology stocks pushed the Dow into a correction in mid-February,
and the index has struggled until this week.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many of the blue chips that have been beaten down in
recent weeks enticed investors as relative bargains. Johnson &AMP;
Johnson rose 2 15/16 to 79~, 3M rose 6 7/16 to 88 15/16 and General
Electric rose 4 7/16 to 137 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   Also, American Express rose 10[ to 143, and J.P. Morgan gained 9
to 125{. Financial services companies were helped along by an
inflation report that was no worse than Wall Street had expected.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's too soon to tell whether this is anything more than a
short-term head fake,'' said David G. Sowerby, vice president at
Loomis, Sayles &AMP; Co. ''But a wide range of stocks are participating
and it looks very good.''
</P>
<P>
   After three days of heavy selling, investors began returning to
some well-known technology names that have slipped this week. JDS
Uniphase rose 6~ to 125| and PMC-Sierra rose 19 31/64 to 205 31/64.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of these high-growth stocks had gotten to such extreme
valuations,'' said Matt Finn, chief investment officer of the
growth and income group at Evergreen Funds in Boston. ''They were

</P>
<P>
   Stocks rose even after the Labor Department's Producer Price

the largest gain in nearly 10 years, as gasoline, home heating oil
and other energy costs rose.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation figures, including the Consumer Price Index due for
release on Friday, are sure to be closely watched by the Federal
Reserve as it weighs whether still higher interest rates are needed
to cool the economy. In a continuing effort to keep inflation at
bay, the Fed has raised rates four times since last June, and it
meets again Tuesday, when investors are expecting a fifth rate
hike.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors were heartened by the fact that the ''core''
rate of inflation at the wholesale level, which excludes the
volatile energy and food categories, matched expectations with a
0.3 percent gain in today's report.
</P>
<P>
   ''The core rate was in line with what we expected,'' said Finn.
''The Fed is on its way to taking the edge off inflation, and it's
looking like they aren't going to have to be excessive to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The bond market improved modestly, lending support to stocks.
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.05 percent from
6.07 percent late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-1 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.19 billion shares
at late afternoon, well ahead of Wednesday's heavy pace.
</P>
<P>
   Volatility was magnified because Friday is a ''triple-witching''
session, a once-a-quarter event when contracts on stock options,
index options, and index futures all expire. Those expirations
generally cause increased gyrations on Wall Street.

<HEADLINE> Austria Urged To Compensate Jews  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The World Jewish Congress demanded Thursday
that Austria compensate Jews for assets taken by the Nazis in World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   Elan Steinberg, executive director, cited a 1953 U.S. government
report that more than $1 billion -- or $10 billion currently -- was
seized by Austria from its Jewish citizens under a 1938 decree.
</P>
<P>
   He said the assets included property now occupied by Joerg
Haider, who has praised Adolf Hitler's ''orderly employment''
policies and lauded veterans of the murderous Waffen SS as ''decent
people of good character.''
</P>
<P>
   Haider headed the far-right Freedom Party, which is part of
Austria's ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will fight Haider,'' Steinberg vowed in a telephone
interview from his office in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Austria formed a union with Nazi Germany in 1938. There were
about 200,000 Jews living in Austria, most of them in Vienna, the
capital. Homes and business owned by Jews were seized; they were
ordered to turn over their assets.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the Austrian Jews emigrated before the
outbreak of World War II in September 1939.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 65,000 Jews were murdered by the Germans and their
allies, among them Austrian Jews who had fled but did not get
beyond the reach of the Nazis and their killing machine.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said Austria, unlike Germany, has never paid
reparations.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, a steering committee that includes the World
Jewish Congress and several other groups said ''it has been known
for more than a half-century that Jews from Austria were deprived
of their assets in an immoral and violent manner.''
</P>
<P>
   And, the committee said, since a large part of those assets were
not returned, restitution should be made by those who now hold the
assets to the survivors and the heirs of victims.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the approximately 20,000 survivors are elderly. The
committee said payment to them was of ''utmost urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee called on the Austrian government to pay
individual compensation to all victims of Nazi persecution with
''special regard for those who were taken to concentration camps.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee also said ''an education campaign on the moral
aspects of the Holocaust in Austria is important, both for Austria
and the wider world.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the assets not returned to Jews, the committee said, are
70,000 apartments and 35,000 businesses.
</P>
<P>
   European governments and the United States distanced themselves
from Austria to protest the inclusion of Freedom Party members in a
new government.
</P>
<P>
   The Austrian government has said Haider does not make government
policy. While he has announced he was stepping down as leader of
the party, he wields influence on the federal government through
those holding ministerial positions.

<HEADLINE> Muslims Pilgrims Celebrate Feast  </HEADLINE>
By BASSEM MROUE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINA, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Pilgrims celebrated one of the Muslim
world's most important feasts Thursday, sacrificing camels and
cattle and symbolically stoning the devil as their holy journey
wound down.
</P>
<P>
   Pilgrims were expected to slaughter more than a half-million
camels, cows and sheep by Sunday near this tent city that only
comes to life during the annual Muslim pilgrimage, or hajj.
</P>
<P>
   The hajj peaked Wednesday with prayers on Mount Arafat, a hill
outside the holy city of Mecca where the Prophet Mohammed delivered
his last sermon in 632 A.D. On Thursday, pilgrims in white cast
seven pebbles the size of marbles at three pillars that symbolize
the devil: ''In the name of God, God is great,'' they repeated.
</P>
<P>
   The pillars are at the center of giant ramps built to
accommodate the huge crowds of pilgrims who must complete the
ritual by dusk. Muslim tradition says it was here that the devil
tried to tempt the Prophet Abraham to disobey God by refusing to
sacrifice his son.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hajj is very much fascinating. I have witnessed places I had
read about for long years,'' said Mukwana Mohammed, 53, of Uganda.
''I also saw the biggest gathering on Earth on Mount Arafat.''
</P>
<P>
   Muslims around the world on Thursday celebrated Eid al-Adha, or
the feast of sacrifice, by slaughtering animals and sharing a part
of the meat with friends and giving the rest to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leaders welcomed the Muslim feast with prayers that
peace talks will give them a capital in Jerusalem, the third
holiest city to Islam. In Indonesia, the world's most populous
Islamic nation, blood ran in the gutters in front of mosques as the
faithful slit the throats of cows, goats and lambs while chanting
prayers.
</P>
<P>
   Hard times toned down celebrations in Iraq, where sanctions
imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait have pushed the middle
class into poverty and widened the gap between rich and poor. ''We
have no Eid. For us we see it only in the calendar,'' said Atheer
Ahmad, a government civil servant.
</P>
<P>
   For pilgrims in Saudi Arabia this year, most of the animals will
be sacrificed at a new $125 million slaughterhouse in Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   Pilgrims can go to slaughterhouses to buy and slaughter animals
themselves or they can pay a bank or company to do it on their
clients behalf. Meat is sent to the needy in 27 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Pilgrims arrived Thursday at Mina from Muzdalifah, where they
had collected pebbles for the stoning ceremony. Wide streets along
three-mile route were a sea of white. Many pilgrims walked; others
crowded inside and on top of cars, buses and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Vendors filled the streets selling food, prayer rugs and
umbrellas to stave off the sun on a 100 degree day. Helicopters
hovered overhead and ambulances and police cars patrolled the
streets to ensure calm.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the hajj has been free from large-scale
disasters. Six Palestinian and Jordanian pilgrims were crushed to
death last week inside Mecca's Grand Mosque. This week, two women
from the Russian republic of Dagestan were killed in a bus
accident; a Kuwaiti boy and his parents died in a car accident.
</P>
<P>
   Hajj -- one of the most sacred duties of the Muslim faith -- is
required at least once of every able-bodied Muslim who can afford
it.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 2.1 million people are taking part in the hajj, one
of the five pillars of Islam. There are more than 1 billion Muslims
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   Pilgrims will also circle the Kaaba, a cubic stone structure in
Mecca, to which Muslims around the world turn for prayer.
</P>
<P>
   After completing the rituals, pilgrims clip some of their hair.
Some Muslims shave their head, imitating Mohammed, who shaved his
head after his pilgrimage.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Rebels Allege Betrayals  </HEADLINE>
By LYOMA TURPALOV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALKHAZUROVO, Russia (AP) -- Exhausted Chechen rebel fighters
fleeing Russian forces say a split with Islamic fundamentalists
wrecked the insurgents' strategy of continuing the war from bases
in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The haggard fighters, many suffering from frostbite and hunger,
say that Wahhabis, members of a fundamentalist sect who were
supposed to prepare bases in the mountains for the rebels, betrayed
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Wahhabis had been deployed in the mountains since December.
After the fall in February of the Chechen capital, Grozny, the
rebels retreated to the southern mountains.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of aiding the retreating units, the Wahhabi fighters
fled, leaving the retreating rebels as prey for Russian jets and
artillery, rebel commanders and fighters said in interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Wahhabis betrayed us,'' said Saikhan, a fighter who would
only give his first name. ''They were supposed to prepare supplies
and bases for the guerrilla war. But when we got into the mountains
after that grueling march, hoping for a rest, they wouldn't give us
a piece of bread.''
</P>
<P>
   Another rebel fighter, Zubair, said his battered unit retreating
from Grozny reached the mountains and met a group of Wahhabis on a
tractor.
</P>
<P>
   ''We asked them to put our wounded comrades on a trailer, but
they refused,'' Zubair said. ''They don't deserve the name of
humans, let alone (Islamic) faithful. They abandon the wounded and
don't bury the dead.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the rebels interviewed could explain the reason for the
split, although some accused the Wahhabis of siding with the
Russians to avoid the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Wahhabis, who are the dominant sect in Saudi Arabia, have
imposed their strict interpretation of Islamic law in parts of
Dagestan and are disliked by many in neighboring Chechnya.
Wahhabism is known for enforcing public morals and compelling other
Muslims to strictly observe Islamic duties such as praying five
times daily.
</P>
<P>
   Most Chechens are Sufi Muslims, a moderate sect. The Wahhabis
were also resented for their wealth in the poor region, money that
reportedly came from kidnapping rings that amassed millions of
dollars from ransoms.
</P>
<P>
   Adlan, a rebel commander, said that when his unit recently
reached the mountain village of Itum-Kale looking for shelter, the
Wahhabis who had been holding the settlement fled. Within hours,
Russian troops were dropped on nearby hills. Adlan's men had to
fight alone for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''My boys swore an oath to wage a war on the Wahhabis as soon as
the Russians leave,'' Adlan said.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to stay in the mountains, the rebels tried to slip
through Russian lines and reach their villages in the plains.
Scores of rebels have been killed and wounded in fighting in recent
days, trying to break through.
</P>
<P>
   Arbi Barayev, a Wahhabi chief, left the mountains with some 600
of his men, reportedly buying safe passage from the Russians,
according to other rebels. Ordinary rebels, with no money, had to
fight their way out.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bodies of our comrades still lie on the mountain paths and
river beds,'' Zubair said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military controls much of Chechnya and has inflicted
heavy losses on the rebels, but has been unable to defeat the
insurgents. Although rebel units are on the run, the insurgents
killed more than 200 Russian soldiers in the past two weeks, wiping
out three federal units in separate battles.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their losses, the rebels say they will go on fighting.
''We need a rest, and then we will continue the war,'' Adlan said,
adding that he wants to avenge Russian bombing of Chechen villages.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were killing everyone -- children, elderly people,
animals,'' he said. ''Russian jets were pursuing even sheep and
horses. For the first time in my life I saw tears in the eyes of
horses in agony.''

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Finish Mixed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures turned in a mixed
performance Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade as investors
split between profit-taking and betting on higher prices due to
drought.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat took the biggest tumble, declining on improving prospects
for the U.S. winter wheat crop, which accounts for about 70 percent
of the nation's production. A midsession rally in corn and soybeans
also supported the price.
</P>
<P>
   Corn also retreated as cautious investors took profits ahead of
a long-range forecast due out later Thursday. Any sign of heavy
rains ahead in the Midwest could easily wipe out the week's strong
gains, market-watchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans forged to a six-week high on continuing speculation
that the ongoing drought will hurt crops, then fell to near even by
the close.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for May delivery fell 2{ cents to $2.66\ a bushel; May
corn fell } cent to $2.35\ a bushel; May oats rose } cent to $1.20{
a bushel; May soybeans rose { cent to $5.25{ a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Beef futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while
pork futures were mixed.
</P>

   April live cattle fell .65 cent to 72.12 cents a pound; May
feeder cattle fell .45 cent to 83.22 cents a pound; April lean hogs
fell .47 cent to 61.80 cents a pound; May pork bellies rose 1.27

<HEADLINE> Russia Nixes Actor's Mir Mission  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Actor Vladimir Steklov was supposed to blast off
to the Mir next month to portray a renegade cosmonaut who won't
leave the space station, but now Russia won't let him get off
Earth, a space official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The space movie in which Steklov was to have starred was another
in a series of unorthodox proposals for resuscitating the dormant
space station with private money.
</P>
<P>
   But Konstantin Kreidenko, a spokesman for the Russian Aerospace
Agency, said that Steklov ''will not go to Mir as earlier planned
because of the failure to meet the terms of the contract.''
Kreidenko declined to give details, but it appears that Steklov's
producers couldn't pay for his ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Although producers of the movie, tentatively titled ''The Last
Journey,'' claimed they made an initial payment to get the project
under way, Russian space officials complained they haven't even
been paid for Steklov's training, let alone the multimillion-dollar
bill for the flight.
</P>
<P>
   Steklov complained that his investment of time for training came
to nothing. ''Now I am a jobless actor, a hobo,'' he said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
   The movie was to have told the story of a renegade cosmonaut who
refuses to leave Mir, insisting he'll orbit the Earth for the rest
of his days. Ground controllers decide to send up a woman to lure
him back.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, cosmonauts Sergei Zalyotin and Alexander Kaleri
are tentatively set to blast off to Mir on April 4, he said. The
station has been unmanned since August.
</P>
<P>
   Zalyotin and Kaleri are expected to spend 45 days on board Mir.
They will take a movie camera with them and possibly shoot some
footage for the movie, Kreidenko said.
</P>
<P>
   The state-controlled RKK Energia company that built and owns the
14-year old station has made frantic efforts to keep it aloft by
raising private funds.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's cash-strapped government had said it would abandon the
station this month unless private investors came up with funds.
</P>
<P>
   But the government changed its mind and kept Mir in orbit after
the Amsterdam-based MirCorp agreed to pay between $10 million and
$20 million -- the price was not disclosed -- for the rights to offer
rides to space tourists, provide satellite repair and produce
products in weightlessness.
</P>
<P>
   Ownership of the station remains with the Russian government,
and Acting President Vladimir Putin has already pledged to keep Mir
alive.
</P>
<P>
   The government has ruled that Energia can use booster rockets
and cargo ships for the Mir which had originally been earmarked for
the International Space Station project.
</P>
<P>
   The reapportioning has angered the U.S. space agency NASA; the
ISS already is far behind schedule because of Russia's failure to
provide a key module.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, in turn, is annoyed about a law signed by President
Clinton this week that would cut U.S. payments to Russia for the
ISS project if Russian companies are found to have helped Iran
develop nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Foreign Ministry on Wednesday called the new U.S.
measure ''yet another attempt to give internal U.S. legislation an
extraterritorial nature, which goes completely against
international law.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Soldier Arraigned in N. Ireland  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- A former British soldier was
arraigned on terrorist charges Thursday following an inquiry into
the 1999 assassination of a prominent Catholic attorney, a case
that captured worldwide attention.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, police prevented Irish Republican Army dissidents
from shattering Northern Ireland's uneasy peace. They intercepted a
car packed with explosives -- the first such seizure since a 1998
attack claimed 29 lives. Three people were arrested, including a
convict paroled under terms of the province's 1998 Good Friday
peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1999 slaying case, Protestant militant William Thompson,
28, was in court facing charges of possessing an Uzi submachine
gun, a sawed-off shotgun, ammunition and explosive powder. He also
was charged with membership in an outlawed anti-Catholic gang, the
Loyalist Volunteer Force.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson -- who resigned last year from the Royal Irish Regiment,
the British army's locally recruited unit -- is the first person to
face charges as a result of a special investigation into the March
1999 death of lawyer Rosemary Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   The English-led team of detectives suspects that Thompson was
involved in the killing. But it interrogated Thompson for a week --
the maximum allowed under anti-terrorist law -- and didn't gather
evidence that would allow him to be charged specifically with
Nelson's murder.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, 40, bled to death after a booby-trap bomb exploded
beneath her car, blowing off her legs. She had represented
prominent Irish Republican Army suspects and filed civil lawsuits
against the province's predominantly Protestant police force.
</P>
<P>
   The sophistication of the bomb, plus her claims that police
officers had issued verbal death threats to her face, fueled
allegations that individual officers helped her killers.
</P>
<P>
   In the car seizure, police found 500 pounds of fertilizer-based
explosives hidden in one of two cars apparently bound for Belfast.
They linked the operation to the Real IRA, a dissident band
responsible for the August 1998 car-bombing in the town of Omagh,
the most lethal attack in Northern Irish history.
</P>
<P>
   The convict among the three arrested was previously linked to
another IRA splinter group, the Irish National Liberation Army, or
INLA. He received a five-year sentence in 1998 for mailing letter
bombs to senior Protestant politicians, but was paroled last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Like the IRA, both the Real IRA and INLA are supposed to be
observing cease-fires.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Washington, Britain's Northern Ireland secretary,
Peter Mandelson, said police had ''prevented another potential
atrocity'' by seizing the explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's developments came as Northern Ireland's senior
politicians gathered in Washington to debate their continuing
failure to forge a workable Protestant-Catholic administration, the
key goal of the province's peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   A four-party coalition government took office Dec. 2, but
Britain stripped it of power Feb. 11 after the IRA refused to make
any commitment to disarm. The group was supposed to begin scrapping
its hidden weapons stockpiles as part of an American-brokered deal
that got the IRA-linked Sinn Fein party two seats in the 12-member
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA called a cease-fire in 1997 after killing about 1,800
people.

<HEADLINE> Two Hurt in German School Shooting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROSENHEIM, Germany (AP) -- A 16-year-old shot the director of his
boarding school Thursday after being suspended for ''rebellious
behavior,'' then turned the large-caliber pistol on himself, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   The ninth grader was sent home Wednesday, and a test showed he
had used drugs. He returned to the school Thursday, encountered the
school director in a stairwell and pumped several bullets into him,
then fired several times at his own head, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Both the student and the 57-year-old director suffered
life-threatening head wounds and were taken to hospitals by
helicopter, authorities said. The names of the student and the
director were not made public.
</P>
<P>
   After being suspended, the student had been taken to his
parents' home near the school in the southern German town of
Brannenburg, near the Austrian border, police said. Early Thursday,
the director received results of a test that showed the student had
used drugs.
</P>
<P>
   School authorities were to have decided soon on whether the
student should be permanently expelled.
</P>
<P>
   The school has 94 students from throughout Germany and who range
in age from 12 to 18.
</P>
<P>
   The student had been in a computer science class taught by the
school director. It was not clear how the teen-ager obtained the
gun.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting is just the latest in a string of school violence
in Germany, shocking a nation unaccustomed to such violent crimes
and prompting calls for tightening already strict gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Germans read about the wave of school shootings in
the United States, but believed it couldn't happen here.
</P>
<P>
   But in November, a 16-year-old boy killed four people in a
shooting spree in an Alpine Bavarian town, then shot himself. That
same month, a 15-year-old student fatally stabbed his teacher 22
times with a kitchen knife because he said he hated her.

<HEADLINE> Yale professor creates system to pick Final Four winners, losers  </HEADLINE>
By NATASHA GURAL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Yale University mathematician Edward H.
Kaplan is just trying to have fun with March Madness.
</P>
<P>
   The professor spent hours-- mostly in hotel rooms in Rome and
Jerusalem-- mulling over ways to beat the odds in NCAA men's college
basketball tournament pools. Then suddenly, a system of computer
betting became obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just a hard enough problem that I had to sit down and
really think,'' he said. ''But once you see it, it follows
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   The real test will come as Kaplan's picks on about 10 pools are
tested on the tournament which started Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In one Internet pool run by a professor at Mesa State College in
Colorado, Kaplan used ratings by Jeff Sagarin which appear in USA
Today, to select Texas as the underdog, Michigan State, Duke and
Stanford. In that pool, he has Stanford beating Texas in the final.
</P>
<P>
   The picks vary depending on the specific rules of each pool,
Kaplan said. Input including regular season records, expert
ratings, Las Vegas odds and market statements is put into various
models.
</P>
<P>
   ''The object is to come up with a set of picks before the
tournament begins that would maximize the expected number of points
in the pool,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In more complicated pools, points increase as the tournament
moves ahead and participants are rewarded for going deeper into the
pool.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pools like that encourage you to pick favorites,'' he said.
''It will be very hard for most people to do better than the
seeds.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, it could be that the rankings don't reflect the
teams potential if a top player is injured.
</P>
<P>
   The most complicated pools are ''wild in that they offer
incentives for picking upsets,'' Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan's first test came over the summer when he calculated the
winners of last year's Final Four using only data available before
the tournament started. In that case, he correctly choose 41 games.
</P>
<P>
   With his model, he expects to correctly identify winners in 38
of the 63 games. Last year was easier than most because the top
seeds were ''overwhelming,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know much about basketball,'' the 44-year-old Hamden
resident said. ''I never did it systematically before. I always let
my sentiments get in the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientific considerations aside, Kaplan said he would probably
pick Duke or Michigan State this year.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, his sentiments would have served him as well as the
model. He said he had choose Connecticut as he's lived in the state
since coming to Yale in 1987. He is a professor at the Yale School
of Management.
</P>
<P>
   His 6-year-old daughter, however, could have benefiting from the
model.

<HEADLINE> New Vietnam Plaque Location Opposed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A plaque honoring those who died as a result
of the Vietnam War -- but not during the conflict -- should be placed
in Arlington National Cemetery and not near the Vietnam memorial,
the chairman of a federal commission said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The plaque belongs on military property rather than the National
Mall, said John G. Parsons, chairman of the National Capital
Memorial Commission and an associate regional director of the
National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   The plaque would honor soldiers and civilians who died of
wounds, illnesses or stress-related problems that were attributed
to the war.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial ''would seem comfortable'' in the cemetary because
''many of the fallen comrades are there,'' Parsons told a House
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons' panel joined recently with the Commission of Fine Arts
and the National Capital Planning Commission to ban new memorials
on the National Mall between the Capitol and the Lincoln Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   ''I fully understand what's trying to be done here,'' he said.
''I've also spent the last 20 years fending off proposals just like
this to not proliferate the area with memorials.''
</P>
<P>
   The House Resources Committee's subcommittee on national parks
and public lands is considering legislation that would authorize a
plaque three-feet square on the grounds of the Vietnam memorial.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is vital for us to have a place to honor all the men and
women who have served and died for their country,'' said Rep. Elton
Gallegly, who is sponsoring the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The plaque would not go on the wall or in front of it, the
California Republican said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Has Record Gain of 495.47  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow industrials rocketed a record 495 points
in heavy trading Thursday on top of Wednesday's 320-point surge as
a bargain-hunting spree among ''old'' economy issues engineered a
stunning reversal of fortunes for Wall Street's best-known
indicator.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-focused Nasdaq Stock Market, which this week was
swooning sharply from record heights, rode the Dow's coattails to a
sharp gain.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 495.47 points, or 4.9
percent, to close at 10,626.88, according to preliminary figures.
Wall Street's best-known indicator easily beat the record for the
sharpest one-day Dow point rise ever -- 380.53 -- which was set Sept.
8, 1998. It was not near a record for the biggest daily percentage
gain, however.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's too soon to tell whether this is anything more than a
short-term head fake,'' said David G. Sowerby, vice president at
Loomis, Sayles &AMP; Co. ''But a wide range of stocks are participating
and it looks very good.''
</P>
<P>
   But even with its unprecedented two-day rally, the Dow remained
9.4 percent below its Jan. 14 record of 11,722.98.
</P>
<P>
   Investors' willingness to dump blue-chip stocks in favor of
technology stocks pushed the Dow into a ''correction'' in
mid-February, and the index has struggled until this week.
</P>
<P>
   But traders are once more paying attention to old-line
businesses, and companies like General Electric, American Express,
Johnson &AMP; Johnson and 3M were leading the Dow higher Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, which closed last Friday at a record
5,048.62, was up 135.06 at 4,717.68 at the closing bell after being
down as much as 127 earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   At the depths of its decline Thursday, the Nasdaq was down 11.8
percent from last Friday. With its recovery later in the day
Thursday, its decline was 6.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A drop of more than 10 percent is considered a signal of a
correction, or downturn in a rising market.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of these high-growth stocks had gotten to such extreme
valuations,'' said Matt Finn, chief investment officer of the
growth and income group at Evergreen Funds in Boston. ''They were
due to come down.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue-chip shares rose even after the Labor Department's Producer
Price Index showed that wholesale prices surged 1 percent in
February, the largest gain in nearly 10 years, as gasoline, home
heating oil and other energy costs rose.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors were heartened by the fact that the ''core''
rate of inflation at the wholesale level, which excludes the
volatile energy and food categories, matched expectations with a
0.3 percent gain in Thursday's report.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation figures, including the Consumer Price Index due for
release on Friday, are sure to be closely watched by the Federal
Reserve as it weighs whether still higher interest rates are needed
to cool the economy. In a continuing effort to keep inflation at
bay, the Fed has raised rates four times since last June, and it
meets again Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Volatility Thursday was magnified because it is the eve of a
''triple-witching'' session, a once-a-quarter event when contracts
on stock options, index options, and index futures all expire.
Those expirations generally cause increased gyrations on Wall
Street.

<HEADLINE> More Money Urged for Bag Screeners  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHEPARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Airline baggage screeners, who provide a
crucial line of defense in the nation's airline safety program,
often quit their jobs to make more money flipping hamburgers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Screeners are a critical link in the performance chain,''
Cathal Flynn, the Federal Aviation Administration's associate chief
for security, said during a hearing Thursday of a House Aviation
subcommittee panel.
</P>
<P>
   ''While it is difficult to verify a correlation between better
pay and better performance, we can all agree that properly trained
and qualified people who are on the job longer tend to perform
better,'' Flynn said.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony had subcommittee members searching for ways to
improve the pay and training for screeners and other ways of
beefing up airport security.
</P>
<P>
   Highly complex and expensive bomb detection machines are often
operated by people making $5.75 to $6.75 an hour, said subcommittee
chairman Rep. John Duncan, R-Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can go to fast-food operations for better job
opportunities,'' Duncan said. ''It leads to an extremely high
turnover rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Texas, added ''You get what you
pay for.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Dillingham, a transportation expert at the General
Accounting Office, said a department study in Belgium, Canada,
France and the United Kingdom found airport screeners had to meet
more rigorous requirements for the job but were paid more and got
better benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In those countries, responsibility for airport screening rests
with the individual airports or a government entity, as opposed to
the air carriers as done in the U.S., Dillingham said.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA has several programs underway to address screener
problems including the start up of a screening company
certification program and automated monitoring of screener
performance. However, Dillingham said the FAA certification program
is two years behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ''The FAA has fallen short of meeting its screener goals,''
Dillingham said.
</P>
<P>
   FAA spokeswoman Rebecca Trexler said the delay was unavoidable
but that the department is moving as swiftly on the self-imposed
goals as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Alexis M. Stefani, deputy assistant inspector general for
aviation, criticized the FAA for weak background investigation
requirements for airport workers in secure areas.
</P>
<P>
   While individuals convicted of one of 25 types of serious crimes
within a 10 year period are denied airport identification, some
airport employees have been found to have committed crimes ranging
from assault with a deadly weapon, robbery and larceny, Stefani
said.
</P>
<P>
   Trexler said the FAA supports expanding the crime categories.
</P>
<P>
   Stefani suggested expanding the list of crimes beyond 25 and she
seemed to have support for that notion from the committee members.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is amazing to me that we let the system continue this
way,'' said Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore. ''By the grace of God, we
have good equipment and most people are honest. But why have a weak
link?''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the House approved and sent to the president
legislation that would significantly increase spending on airport
safety and modernization. It also could mean higher taxes on
tickets.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Troops Sweep Kosovo Region  </HEADLINE>
By GJERAQINA TUHINA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- American soldiers trying to stop
ethnic Albanian militants from infiltrating into Serbia from Kosovo
seized weapons and detained nine people in a sweep of the volatile
boundary region, the U.S. military said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the Serbian region of Presevo, near Kosovo's southeastern
boundary, troops using helicopters and armored vehicles seized more
than 200 uniforms, 22 crates of rifle and machine gun ammunition,
two mortars, 28 hand grenades, seven rifles, six land mines and
other military supplies, the military said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military's Task Force Falcon said the sites ''were
clearly being used as cache sites for weapons, ammunition and
supplies'' for ''fringe or extremist elements operating in Kosovo,
Macedonia or the Presevo Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Kosovo and the region right across the border are
technically part of Serbia, the larger member of the Yugoslav
federation led by Slobodan Milosevic. But Kosovo -- which has a
heavily ethnic Albanian population -- has been under international
control since last year's conflict between ethnic Albanians and
Milosevic's Serb forces led to NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the United States and other Western governments fear that
the boundary region could be the scene of renewed fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred ethnic Albanian guerrillas are believed to have
crossed the boundary into Serbia to attack Serbs, their villages
and homes. More than a year ago, similar attacks in Kosovo prompted
Milosevic to drive hundreds of thousands of Albanians from the
province.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said about 300 American troops carried out this
week's operation. Task Force Falcon said in a statement that search
operations would continue until the areas along the boundary ''have
been thoroughly cleared.''
</P>
<P>
   Serb police also have stepped up operations within the area.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to their tough stance in the Presevo Valley region,
NATO-led peacekeepers backed away from further confrontation in
ethnically divided Kosovska Mitrovica, Kosovo's other hotspot.
</P>
<P>
   The city is divided into predominantly Serb and predominantly
ethnic Albanian sections by the Ibar river.
</P>
<P>
   Following a clash Wednesday with Serb civilians that cost two
civilians limbs, French commanders modified their plan to clear a
bridge over the Ibar of Serb observers. The observers had been
tracking ethnic Albanians trying to cross from the other side.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the French agreed to let both the Serb observers and
international observers keep watch over the bridge connecting the
Serb and Albanian halves of the city. And French military spokesmen
said NATO peacekeepers have for the time being suspended plans to
remove Serb guards from a second bridge.
</P>
<P>
   No incidents were reported in the city Thursday, a day after the
clash between NATO troops and about 300 Serb civilians that left a
mother of three and another Serb requiring foot amputations. At
least 15 Serbs and an undetermined number of peacekeepers and
journalists were injured in Wednesday's melee.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs oppose unification of the city, saying NATO cannot protect
them against attacks by ethnic Albanians seeking revenge for
Milosevic's 18-month crackdown.

<HEADLINE> Johns Hopkins Students End Sit-in  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX DOMINGUEZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Students ended a 17-day sit-in at Johns Hopkins
University on Thursday, claiming progress in their fight for a
''living wage'' for university employees and contract workers.
</P>
<P>
   The university did not agree to increase wages or hold
contractors to the ''living wage'' pay scale, but signed an
agreement calling for the formation of a committee to ''discuss the
causes and consequences of poverty, including compensation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What we've got here is not a victory, but something that
allows us to move beyond a sit-in,'' said Vikram Kambampati, a
member of the Student Labor Action Committee. ''We realize this is
what we can get from a sit-in at this point, and we are ready to
move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Between a dozen and three dozen protesters had been sitting and
sleeping in shifts on couches and the floor of the lobby of Garland
Hall, the university's administration building, since Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Students cheered Thursday morning when Jim McGill, the
university's senior vice president for finance and administration,
descended the stairs to the lobby and signed the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   University officials have said they cannot agree to a living
wage, the amount needed to keep a family of four over the federal
poverty line, since that varies with inflation and other factors
and creates ''an unpredictable moving target.''
</P>
<P>
   The students had called on the school to match Baltimore's
living wage standard of $7.90 an hour. The federal minimum wage is
$5.15 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Hopkins set $7.75 an hour as a target wage by July
2002. Spokesman Dennis O'Shea said the university is ahead of
schedule on the commitment.
</P>
<P>
   All direct employees of the university are at that level. The
lowest paid on-campus contract employees now make $6 an hour and
will make $6.50 an hour beginning July 1, the university said.

<HEADLINE> Strike Ends in Time for Pope's Visit  </HEADLINE>
By DANA BUDEIRI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Garbage collectors in Nazareth are going back
to work, a city official announced Thursday, ending a strike that
had threatened to spoil Pope John Paul II's visit to the city of
Jesus' boyhood.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to remove another potential obstacle, ultra-Orthodox
rabbis tried to dispel suggestions that ultra-Orthodox Jews oppose
the pope's visit next week.
</P>
<P>
   Piles of stinking trash littered Nazareth's streets, the result
of a walkout by city workers who complained they had not been paid.
The city backed the workers, demanding $3.75 million from the
government to cover its operating deficit and prepare for the
pope's visit.
</P>
<P>
   Nazareth city spokesman Ramzi Hakim said the city had received
the money and the workers would return to their jobs Friday. ''We
will work 24 hours a day in order to prepare the city for the visit
of the pope,'' he pledged. Nazareth is the largest Arab city in
Israel, with about 70,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ultra-Orthodox rabbis sought to dispel the
impression, created in part by anti-pope graffiti and posters that
have appeared in religious neighborhoods, that ultra-Orthodox Jews
did not want the pope to visit the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   The rabbis said they welcome the pontiff, but would prefer he
remove his cross while visiting Judaism's holiest site.
</P>
<P>
   An ultra-Orthodox lawmaker and the head of an ultra-Orthodox
seminary told a news conference the Vatican had shown sensitivity
to their concerns that the pope's visit would force Jews to work on
the Jewish Sabbath, noting that a Mass originally scheduled for a
Saturday had been moved to Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbis had objected that the Mass, on the Mount of Beatitudes in
the Galilee, would require more than 20,000 security to be deployed
on the Jewish day of rest.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would like it to be better,'' lawmaker Avraham Ravitz said
of the scheduling compromises, ''but we are not going to protest
more than this.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultra-Orthodox Jews live according to the strictest
interpretation of religious laws. Many men make careers of studying
religious works in rabbinical colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Feldman, head of the Beer Hatorah Yeshiva, urged the pope
to remove the cross around his neck when he visits the Western
Wall, a remnant of the second Jewish Temple and Judaism's holiest
site.
</P>
<P>
   Feldman objected to the cross as ''a symbol of a religion which
those who worship (at the wall) will not believe in,'' but said he
would not raise the issue with organizers of the visit.

<HEADLINE> Newspaper Circulation Change Mulled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The main record-keeper of circulation data for
the newspaper industry is considering adjustments in the way
publishers report their circulation figures.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main changes being considered by the Audit Bureau of
Circulations concerns a rule over pricing, which prevents
newspapers and other publications from counting as paid circulation
any copies that are sold for less than half of their set price,
either on newsstands or by subscription.
</P>
<P>
   Some newspaper publishers want to do away with the so-called
''50 percent rule'' to allow themselves more flexibility in the way
they reach out to new readers through marketing and promotion
efforts, such as offering discounted copies.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lavery, president of the Schaumburg, Ill.-based
organization, said the ABC's board agreed last week to assemble a
team to study the issue of how to redefine the category of paid
circulation.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Lavery said the organization also wants to
ensure that advertisers are provided specific breakdowns of
different categories of circulation, including copies that are
bought by individuals, copies that are bought by third parties such
as hotels and then distributed to readers, and copies that are
given away.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC, which also compiles circulation data for magazines and
professional publications, has set up committees to study issues of
pricing and reporting circulation.
</P>
<P>
   The committees are expected to report their results in July. A
decision by the ABC board could come as early as November.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua Contra War Figure Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- The former leader of a leftist
paramilitary group was ambushed and killed Thursday along a highway
in northern Nicaragua, police reported.
</P>
<P>
   Edmundo Olivas, known by the nom de guerre of Camilo Turcos, was
shot to death near the city of Boaco, 55 miles northeast of the
capital, Managua, police spokesman Carlos Bendana said.
</P>
<P>
   Another man, Francisco Congreras, was also killed in the
shooting and Olivas' wife, Doribel Caceres, was seriously injured.
Police said they did not know the motive for the attack or the
identity of the attackers.
</P>
<P>
   Olivas led a band of ex-Sandinista soldiers known as the Andres
Castro United Front, one of several groups of former combatants
from both sides of Nicaragua's 1980s Contra war. The groups rearmed
to forcibly demand aid from the government or to engage in
banditry.
</P>
<P>
   The Front officially disarmed in 1997 under an agreement with
the government, but some members refused to lay down their weapons
and police have accused them of robberies and kidnappings in the
central part of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Those renegade group members kidnapped Canadian mining engineer
Manly Guarducci, who was released in November after 34 days in
captivity. Olivas served as a mediator between the government and
the kidnappers in that incident.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after Guarducci was freed, another former Front
leader known as ''Comandante Tito'' was killed in the mining town
of Rosario.

<HEADLINE> FTC Charges 2 Drug Cos.  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission charged two drug
companies on Thursday with conspiring to keep generic versions of a
popular blood pressure drug off the market.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the commission said two other companies have
agreed to settle a similar complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The Commission charged that Hoechst Marion Roussel -- now known
as Aventis Pharmaceuticals -- paid Andrx Corporation to keep that
company from marketing a generic version of Cardizem CD, a widely
prescribed drug for treatment of hypertension and chest pain.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are confident that we acted in an appropriate manner and
did not violate any laws in the manner in which we negotiated the
stipulation or otherwise handled our dispute with Andrx,'' said
Aventis' spokesman Charles F. Rouse.
</P>
<P>
   Andrx issued a statement saying the deal actually benefited
consumers by providing it funds to change its product to avoid
patent infringement charges. That meant Andrx could market Cartia
XT, a generic version of Cardizem, before it would otherwise have
been able to do so, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   When the patent on a manufacturer's drug expires generic
versions of the product are usually sold by other companies at
lower prices, sharply reducing the sales of the original maker.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Aventis-Andrx case, the commission also
reported a settlement with Abbott Laboratories and Geneva
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., resolving charges that the companies entered
into a similar agreement in which Abbott paid Geneva substantial
sums to delay bringing to market a generic alternative to Abbott's
brand-name hypertension and prostate drug, Hytrin. In that case the
companies signed a 10-year agreement to avoid such anticompetitive
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ''The financial arrangements between the branded and generic
manufacturers were designed to keep generic versions of Cardizem CD
and Hytrin off the market for an extended period of time,'' said
Richard Parker, Director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition.
</P>
<P>
   ''These types of agreements have the potential to cost consumers
hundreds of millions of dollars each year, Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law the first company that wins government approval to
sell a generic drug receives a 180-day exclusive right to merket
the product before other companies can launch their generic
versions.
</P>
<P>
   When Andrx was preparing to launch a generic form of Cardizem
CD, the commission said, Aventis filed a patent infringement suit.
</P>
<P>
   According to the FTC charges, in September 1997 Hoechst and
Andrx entered into an agreement in which Andrx would not market its
product when it received FDA approval and would not give up or
transfer its 180-day exclusivity right.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the FTC said, Hoechst paid Andrx $10 million per
quarter, beginning in July 1998, when Andrx gained FDA approval for
its product.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC charged that the agreement acted as a bottleneck that
prevented any other potential competitors from entering the market
because, since Andrx did not market its product, its 180 days of
exclusive right to sales did not begin to run.

<HEADLINE> BMW To Cast Off Part of Rover Unit  </HEADLINE>
By HANS GREIMEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Automaker BMW announced plans Thursday
to cast off its money-losing Rover passenger car unit, even though
it could cost up to $3 billion in restructuring charges to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, British investment group Alchemy Partners Ltd.,
will take on the Rover and MG brand cars, including their plant in
Longbridge, England, and recast the venture under the new name MG
Car Co.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past five years, those operations have burdened BMW
with $1.25 billion in red ink and dragged down profit an estimated
28 percent last year alone.
</P>
<P>
   The deal's price remained a matter of contention late Thursday,
and BMW said the two sides were still negotiating the fine print of
the arrangement after the company's supervisory board approved its
outline.
</P>
<P>
   BMW did say, however, that shifting the operations to Alchemy
will set the company back $3 billion, in the form of a one-time
restructuring charge.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said it was unclear whether the price of the deal was
rolled into that charge. Some even speculated BMW wooed Alchemy
into taking the loss-making venture by throwing in a cash
incentive.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even getting Rover for free would not be attractive to most
people. It's a cash-eating company,'' said Christian Breitsprecher,
an auto analyst with Deutsche Bank. ''I'm pretty sure Alchemy's not
paying anything for the deal and is getting something on top.''
</P>
<P>
   While shedding Rover's passenger car division, the fate of its
''crown jewel,'' the popular and pricey Land Rover line of
four-wheel-drive vehicles is unclear. Alchemy said it would not be
buying the SUV line; however, the New York Times reported Thursday
that Ford Motor Co was going to purchase it, citing executives
close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Ford declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   A London official also said BMW was casting about for buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ''BMW are looking to see if an alternative owner will come
forward,'' said Britain's Secretary of State for Trade and Industry
Stephen Byers during a House of Commons debate.
</P>
<P>
   BMW would only say: ''We are making no statement about Land
Rover today.''
</P>
<P>
   BMW did unveil plans Thursday to roll out a new line of the
sporty, subcompact Minis from its Oxford plant in early summer 2001
and continue building the Rover 75 luxury model in Oxford on a
contract basis for Alchemy. The company also plans to finish
construction of its new Hams Hall engine factory in Birmingham and
begin production there.
</P>
<P>
   Investors largely applauded Thursday's announcement sending BMW
stock up 2.25 percent Thursday to close at 31.75 euros ($30.80) in
Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the proposal to shed Rover caused strife at BMW, leading
to the resignation of three members of the management board. The
board has already filled two of those spots, with the third being
shared by Milberg and chief financial officer Helmut Panke.
</P>
<P>
   The Rover line -- headquartered in Warwick, central England -- was
bought by BMW in 1994 mainly to gain access to Rover's popular
sport utility line and flesh out BMW's models at the less-expensive
end of the car market. BMW has already pumped $3.4 billion into
Rover since buying the group for $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The strengthening of the British pound since 1997 has made it
more expensive for the German company to build Rover vehicles in
Britain and export them to other countries in Europe where it earns
revenues in weaker currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about BMW closing down plants or pulling out operations,
the British government has earmarked a $240 million subsidy for the
company, which the European Union Commission is currently
scrutinizing under EU competition rules.
</P>
<P>
   Without the subsidy, union leaders say 16,000 of Rover's 30,000
jobs could be at risk.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Overpaid for Plane Parts  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN M. DONNELLY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon paid nearly triple the fair and
reasonable price for a part that keeps the propellers on C-130
Hercules transport planes from icing over, according to two
government officials familiar with an internal military audit.
</P>
<P>
   The report is ''for official use only'' by the Pentagon and has
not been released publicly. But Robert Lieberman, the Pentagon's
assistant inspector general for audits, told a House panel Thursday
the ''propeller blade heaters'' were an ''egregious'' example of a
wider problem that has long beset the military: Overpaying for
aircraft parts. Under the contract that included the propeller
heater, the Pentagon paid 38 percent more than it should have for a
variety of parts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two other officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
provided more detail. They said the Defense Logistics Agency last
year bought 1,803 of the propeller heaters from United Technology's
Hamilton Standard -- now Hamilton Sundstrand -- at a cost of roughly
$555 apiece, when the fair price was closer to $200 each.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the military paid just over $1 million for the
parts, instead of about $365,000, they said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Stan Soloway, the Pentagon's deputy undersecretary for
acquisition reform, told the House Government Reform subcommittee
on government management, the audit is ''questionable.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not at all convinced the prices are unreasonable and
unfair,'' he told subcommittee chairman Rep. Steve Horn, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Windsor Locks, Conn.-based Hamilton
Sundstrand, Peg Hashem, said it would be ''inappropriate'' to
comment on an internal Pentagon report. But, she said, ''The blade
heater is only one of approximately 1,500 parts, together with
logistic support services, covered by the contract. ... We believe
the pricing of the contract was fair and reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a new way of doing business adopted in the 1990s, the
Pentagon pays companies not just for parts but for providing a
range of services the military used to do itself, from supply
management to inventory to warehousing, the Pentagon's Soloway
said. On balance, the arrangement saves the government money even
if some parts cost more, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That would be fine if you really need those services,''
Lieberman responded, but in many cases, the government doesn't need
a ''middle man'' to manage spares. Notwithstanding Soloway's
defense of the arrangement, Lieberman pointed out that the Pentagon
has already agreed to make changes in this approach.
</P>
<P>
   Soloway said the audit ''is a matter that has been under
significant discussion and debate between us (in the secretary of
defense's office) and the inspector general for some months now.''

<HEADLINE> Port Authority head: I'll fight politically motivated fraud charge  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The chief of the Port Authority of New York and
New Jersey, an appointee and longtime ally of Gov. George Pataki,
charged Thursday that the state attorney general was politically
motivated in accusing him of real estate fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The move by prosecutor Eliot Spitzer, a Democrat, was based on
''incomplete and inaccurate allegations that go back 10 years,''
Port Authority head Robert E. Boyle said in an angry
three-paragraph statement. Pataki is a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer, through spokesman Darren Dopp, replied that the
attorney general had ''rock solid evidence. ... We'll prove it in
court.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyle dismissed the 26-page civil complaint as ''a political
lawsuit,'' announced that he would not resign his $165,000-a-year
job, and promised to fight charges that he profited from an
allegedly shady 1990s real estate deal involving a nonprofit
hospital where he served as chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ''We intend to ... petition the court for dismissal of all
allegations,'' Boyle said shortly after Spitzer described his
actions as ''a very serious civil violation.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki appointed Boyle to the Port Authority job in early 1997.
Prior to that, Boyle had served as president of the Javits Center --
another job provided by the governor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, as treasurer for Pataki's inaugural and transition
committees, Boyle helped raise more than $2.5 million for the newly
elected governor, who defended his friend on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a little shocked that something dating from 1990, 1991,
was brought up,'' Pataki said about the suit. ''I'm surprised by
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pataki stopped short of saying that Spitzer was politically
motivated. The governor said he would not ask Boyle to resign, and
expressed support for Boyle's reappointment when his current term
expires next month.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle allegedly cashed in by hiding his financial interest in a
Westchester County building, then using his position as chairman of
the Hudson Valley Hospital Center to influence its decision to
lease and then buy the property, the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   Due to Boyle's ''improper conduct,'' hospital officials -- after
paying $530,000 to renovate the Croton Building -- paid $550,000
more for the building in 1993 than it would have cost two years
earlier, said the complaint by Spitzer.
</P>
<P>
   ''He benefitted to the tune of several thousands dollars -- a
benefit that is illegal and improper,'' Spitzer said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   According to Spitzer's complaint, Boyle ''fraudulently concealed
material facts'' and ''breached his duty of loyalty'' with his
conduct in the leasing and sale of the property.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint seeks an unspecified amount in damages,
restitution and interest to be determined at trial.
</P>
<P>
   Also named in the complaint were two people who served on the
board at Hudson Valley Hospital Center, Arthur Clements and Ruth
Woolfe.
</P>
<P>
   The charge against Boyle, 63, of Croton-on-Hudson, first emerged
in the federal tax-fraud case of Albert J. Pirro, a prominent
Republican lobbyist and the husband of Westchester District
Attorney Jeanine Pirro.
</P>
<P>
   The allegation -- later dropped by the U.S. attorney's office --
described a real estate deal that he and Albert Pirro entered into
with the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's suit, which covers the same transaction, alleges that
Boyle ignored his legal obligations to protect the hospital in
favor of his desire to turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   According to the suit, Boyle learned two things in early 1991:
that the hospital was looking for new office space and that a
building in nearby Croton-on-Hudson was up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle, after allegedly telling Pirro to buy the building, became
a secret 45 percent partner in Pirro's real estate company,
Distinctive Properties. Boyle then arranged for the hospital to
lease space in the building, which Distinctive Properties had
purchased in April 1991 for $950,000, the suit said.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital spent $530,000 to renovate the building and hired
Rogene Industries, a construction company owned by Boyle, as
construction manager. The building was sold to the hospital by
Distinctive Properties in 1993 at a $550,000 profit.
</P>
<P>
   The bi-state Port Authority oversees the region's three airports
along with many of its bridges and tunnels.

<HEADLINE> Alaska, Wis. Outbreaks Traced  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- A November outbreak of food poisoning that
sickened nearly 200 employees of an Alaska oil company was caused
by contaminated potato salad prepared by an ill cook, according to
a government study.
</P>
<P>
   The Arco Alaska workers' stomach distress was traced to
Norwalk-like viral gastroenteritis, a common disease that sickens
about 23 million people each year, the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC report also linked another November outbreak, at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison, to the same virus.
</P>
<P>
   The case in Anchorage, Alaska, involved 191 employees of Arco
oil who got sick after eating potato salad at a catered lunch.
Health officials began investigating when Arco reported that 20
percent of its employees called in sick Nov. 10.
</P>
<P>
   The food was prepared by an infected worker who mixed the potato
salad with his bare hands in a 12-gallon plastic bin, the CDC said.
</P>
<P>
   In Wisconsin, 19 of 36 students in the same residence hall
contracted the disease after the university's Thanksgiving break.
The CDC has not found a common source for that outbreak, but
reported Thursday that it was also from Norwalk-like virus, named
after the Ohio town where it was first isolated.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms of the virus, including diarrhea, vomiting, fever,
headache, chills and cramps, typically end in 24 to 48 hours. The
virus is transmitted through food, through direct contact and by
sharing linens, towels and bathrooms, said Dr. Alan Ramsey, an
epidemiologist with the Wisconsin Division of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   The virus can be prevented through handwashing and general
diligent cleaning.

<HEADLINE> DAs in 5 counties won't prosecute for babies left in safe havens  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN BREZOSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- District attorneys in five counties have
agreed to not lodge child abandonment charges on mothers who leave
their unwanted newborns in hospitals or other safe places.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement between district attorneys in Schenectady, Albany,
Rensselaer, Saratoga and Washington counties followed a meeting
hosted by Rensselaer County District Attorney Kenneth Bruno. Bruno
says he hopes to gain similar cooperation from prosecutors around
the state, in an effort to reduce incidences of ''dumpster
babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, head of the
New York State District Attorneys Association, said that
prosecutors can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to press
charges against mothers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reality is that teen-age mothers give birth every day of
the week, and there are those who put their self-interest over the
health and the life of their newborn,'' Pirro said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, she said she did not know of any other district
attorneys who had announced they would not prosecute such cases.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno's efforts got statewide attention from his father, Senate
Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, who in a news conference last week
touted the plan as a step against dead babies turning up in trash
bins, bathroom stalls, and wooded patches.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Bruno says he is working on statewide legislation that
would decriminalize child abandonment, provided steps are taken to
ensure the infant is cared for. He said he was cautious of creating
loopholes that could be used to defend child abusers.
</P>
<P>
   Child abandonment is a felony under state law, carrying a
penalty of up to four years in state prison.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in the Syracuse-area district of Republican Sen.
Nancy Larraine Hoffmann have been lenient toward mothers who take
advantage of services, such as ''Jane Doe'' hospital admissions,
for decades. Hoffmann began a campaign as a Syracuse city councilor
in the 1980s, following three deaths in the span of just a few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Federal statistics show that unwanted babies are turning up dead
at an increasing and alarming rate. Of 105 known abandoned babies
in 1998, 33 were found dead. In 1991, 65 babies were left in public
places and eight died.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Criticizes GOP Budget Plan  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Thursday a budget
blueprint emerging in the House is risky and unrealistic, and asked
Republican leaders to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the wrong path for America,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I ask the leadership to change course, to go back and write a
budget that maintains our fiscal discipline and meets our most
pressing priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans pushed a $1.82 trillion budget for next year through
the House Budget Committee on Wednesday. On the near party-line
23-18 vote, only Rep. Mac Collins, R-Ga., defected.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also alluded to last year's budget fight over a $792
billion tax cut proposed by Republicans, and issued a veiled veto
threat.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is unrealistic, unwise,'' Clinton said before leaving the
White House for a bipartisan luncheon on Capitol Hill. ''The risks
it poses are unconscionable. It is as risky and costly as the
budget they proposed last year that I vetoed.''
</P>
<P>
   Cabinet members met at the White House on Thursday morning to
discuss the GOP spending plan, which they said wouldn't shore up
Social Security or Medicare, provide a prescription drug benefit
for Medicare recipients, or adequately invest in education.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I can say is here we go again,'' Health and Human Services
Secretary Donna Shalala said afterward. ''They pick on women, on
kids and on old people.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is how to balance spending priorities with a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP measure -- a roadmap for fiscal 2001 spending and tax
bills Congress will work on later -- contains about $50 billion more
in tax cuts than Clinton wants, and less domestic spending. It
would provide $307 billion for next year's defense budget, $1
billion higher than Clinton's plan. Its $290 billion for domestic
programs is nearly $30 billion less than Clinton prefers.
</P>
<P>
   ''This budget is in stark contrast to the Clinton-Gore tax and
spend approach,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who chairs the
tax-writing Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Archer said Republicans are trying to contain new spending while
taking responsible steps to preserve the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   ''While the president's budget and rhetoric continue to divide
our country and pit one American against another, our balanced
budget unites Americans, no matter their age or station in life,''
Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans would set aside $150 billion for tax
cuts, though they would leave room for perhaps $90 billion more.
They want to avoid another veto fight with Clinton and save a major
tax-cut push for next year, when they hope Texas Gov. George W.
Bush will be in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has made a five-year, $483 billion tax cut a defining issue
of his presidential campaign.

<HEADLINE> Political Notebook  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- One of the most curious sagas of the two-year
election cycle involves Rep. Merrill Cook of Utah, an endangered
Republican with a history of erratic behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous Republicans, speaking on condition of anonymity, say
Cook would be a serious underdog this fall, particularly given the
presence on the ballot of Democrat Jim Matheson, son of a former
two-term governor.
</P>
<P>
   But acting in part out of tactical concerns, the GOP high
command has embraced Cook's candidacy, most visibly when Speaker
Dennis Hastert visited Utah for a fund-raising event. To assure the
leadership's support, these Republicans say, Cook has threatened
several times to run as an independent. That would create a
three-way race that almost certainly would lead to the GOP losing
the seat.
</P>
<P>
   But Cook's leverage may run out with Friday's filing deadline.
If he files as a Republican, he and any GOP challengers move to the
next round, which involves a party convention. A candidate must
gain the support of 40 percent of the convention delegates to
qualify for a primary election.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans, all of whom spoke on condition of
anonymity, said there has been talk of backing an alternative at
the convention in hopes of holding Cook below the 40 percent
threshold.
</P>
<P>
   But Jim Wilkinson, spokesman for the GOP campaign committee,
denied such plans exist. ''We are 100 percent behind Merrill Cook,
all the way to the end,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Humphrey, a spokeswoman for Cook, dismissed the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''Washington leadership doesn't really have a lot of pull with
Utah convention delegates,'' she said. ''That's not a concern of
ours.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ''Frankly, he's their best candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Cook has one Republican rival, Jeff Wright, although
others are possible.
</P>
<P>
   Cook, a Republican who ran unsuccessfully for office three times
as an independent, returned to the GOP fold in the mid-1990s. He is
in his second term in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Days before his 1998 re-election, Cook was thrown out of state
GOP party headquarters following an obscenity-laced tantrum over a
get-out-the-vote campaign message.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters later obtained interoffice e-mail messages written by
Cook's chief of staff, Janet Jenson, who was fired the day after
the election. She alleged the congressman was paranoid, delusional
and unable even to grasp that he had won.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at the time, Cook said that while he sometimes
uses profanity and has a temper, he has no emotional, psychological
or physical problem that would make him unfit to hold office.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am in very good health, mentally and physically,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   In the seesaw battle for control of the House this fall,
Democrats are inching up and Republicans down -- this week, at
least.
</P>
<P>
   Top GOP leaders have weighed in on opposite sides of a contested
primary to pick a challenger to first-termer Rush Holt of New
Jersey, complicating efforts to defeat one of the nation's most
vulnerable Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert and Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia, chairman of the GOP
campaign committee, are supporting former Rep. Dick Zimmer, who
left the House in 1996 to run unsuccessfully for the Senate.
Majority Leader Dick Armey and GOP Whip Tom DeLay support another
former House member, Mike Pappas, who replaced Zimmer, then lost
his seat to Holt in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are the types of developments that you would try to
avoid when you have a tenuous hold on a House majority,'' said Erik
Smith, a spokesman for the House Democratic Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson in rebuttal, pointed to encouraging polls and said no
Republican ''will suffer for lack of resources this fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, meanwhile, were cheered by the results of
California's open primary a week ago, when several candidates ran
well against Republicans listed on the same ballot. In particular,
they noted that challenger Adam Schiff outpolled incumbent GOP Rep.
Jim Rogan, 49 percent to 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And they claimed a record $7 million at their big fund-raiser of
the year Wednesday, a performance that sent GOP leaders scurrying
to match the total at the dinner they had arranged for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   These developments -- all incremental, none definitive -- mark a
turnabout from a few weeks ago. That was when Democratic Virginia
Rep. Owen Pickett unexpectedly announced his retirement, handing
the GOP a good chance to pick up his seat.
</P>
<P>
   And when then-Democratic Rep. Virgil Goode of Virginia announced
plans to become an independent and said he would support the
Republican choice for speaker next year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ohio Democratic Rep. Jim Traficant went out of his
way to praise Republican Speaker Hastert publicly, raising the
possibility he might support him over Democrat Richard Gephardt
when the new Congress convenes in January.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' current majority is 222-211, with two
independents, one favoring each party.

<HEADLINE> Gov.: JonBenet Parents Still Hiding  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN K. PAULSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Gov. Bill Owens said Thursday that John and Patsy
Ramsey are trying to manipulate the public into believing they are
victims even though the couple continues to hide behind their
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys are promoting their new book in which they theorize
that an intruder killed their daughter JonBenet.
</P>
<P>
   Owens stopped short of calling the Ramseys suspects in
JonBenet's slaying but contended they are trying to ''orchestrate a
feeling across the country that they are the victims in the case.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What bothers me is they wouldn't talk when it mattered and now
you're not going to be able to pick up a publication or turn on the
TV without seeing them talking,'' he said. ''I just find it strange
behavior for them to try to become the victims.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor made the comments after he read excerpts from the
Ramseys' book, ''The Death of Innocence,'' which is scheduled to go
on sale Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with ABC's ''20/20,'' set to air Friday, and NBC's
''Today'' show, set to air next week, the Ramseys said they believe
an intruder, perhaps a male pedophile, waited in their home for
hours before he strangled and beat JonBenet in a soured kidnapping
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Her body was found in the basement of the family's Boulder home
on Dec. 26, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Boulder authorities have said the Ramseys remain under an
umbrella of suspicion. A Boulder County grand jury examined
evidence for 13 months before disbanding. No charges were filed and
the Ramseys adamantly maintain their innocence.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Owens urged the Ramseys to return to Colorado from
their Atlanta area home and cooperate with authorities to try to
solve the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Owens said Thursday the Ramseys ''hid behind lawyers and PR
firms from Day One and they're still hiding.''
</P>
<P>
   In their book, the Ramseys accused Owens of making his remarks
for political gain.

<HEADLINE> Barnes &AMP; Noble's Earnings Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc.'s rose more than 9 percent
on Thursday after the giant bookseller reported its sales and
profits climbed in the fourth quarter, fueled by strong results at
its large bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based company said Thursday that it earned $103.5
million, or $1.48 cents a share, in the quarter ended Jan. 29,
2000, compared with $106 million, or $1.47 a share a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Profits from operations -- which include earnings from the
company's bookstores and Babbage's Etc. software chain as well as a
loss at the Barnes &AMP; Noble.com Internet unit but exclude other
investment gains -- were $1.27 a share, compared with 90 cents a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The results topped Wall Street analysts' estimates of $1.25 a
share. The company's stock rose $2.12{ to $20.06\ in trading on the
New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the increased popularity of online bookstores, Barnes &AMP;
Noble managed to have a very strong 1999, and the company expects
its solid performance to extend into 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Sales for the quarter were $1.34 billion, up from $1.03 billion
a year ago. For the year, sales were $3.49 billion, up from $3.01
billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The results were especially strong at Barnes &AMP; Noble's
superstores, with sales rising 12.2 percent for the year. Sales at
the large-format stores open at least a year, an industry gauge of
performance, rose 6.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The only weak spot came at its B. Dalton bookstores, where sales
fell 9.1 percent from a year ago. The company closed 89 stores
during the year at the chain, which is mostly found in malls.
</P>
<P>
   Sales at B. Dalton stores open at least a year were up 0.1
percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In its Babbage's chain, sales rose 18.9 percent, and same-store
sales were up 12.5 percent. Barnes &AMP; Noble said the acquisition of
Babbage's, which it purchased in October, added 10 cents a share to
its earnings.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, Barnes &AMP; Noble earned $124.5 million, or $1.75 a
share, compared with $92.38 million, or $1.29 a share a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of its fiscal year in January, the company operated
542 superstores, 400 B. Dalton stores and 526 Babbage's stores.

<HEADLINE> Vt. House Nears Gay Rights Vote  </HEADLINE>
By ROSS SNEYD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- The Vermont House moved toward approving
historic legislation Thursday allowing gays to form ''civil
unions'' that would carry many of the benefits -- and burdens -- of
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The bill takes Vermont to the very edge of recognizing gay
marriage. It if passes, Vermont will have gone further than any
other state in recognizing same-sex couples.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation has the support of Democratic Gov. Howard Dean
and is also expected to win Senate approval.
</P>
<P>
   As legislators took up the bill, the House chamber overflowed
with spectators. Many wore their feelings on their lapels -- pink
stickers for supporters, white for opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ''This certainly is groundbreaking,'' said Peg Byron of the
Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, a gay advocacy group. ''I
think it really sets a moral as well as a legislative example for
the rest of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay couples who form civil unions would be entitled to some 300
state benefits or privileges available to married couples, in such
areas as inheritance, property transfers, medical decisions,
insurance and taxes. Such couples could file a joint state income
tax return, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government still would not recognize such unions
with regard to such things as immigration rights, Social Security
and federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Congress and more than 30 states have passed laws denying
recognition to same-sex ''marriages'' performed in other states.
Nonetheless, some suggest those state laws might not apply to
same-sex ''civil unions'' performed in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   The Vermont bill provides for unions that amount to marriage in
everything but name. Partners could apply for a license from town
clerks and have their civil union ''certified'' by a justice of the
peace, a judge or a member of the clergy.
</P>
<P>
   The burdens are equally onerous. Partners who want to split up
would have to go through ''dissolution'' proceedings in Family
Court, in the same way that married couples have to pursue a
divorce. They would also assume each other's debts like married
couples.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bill carries Vermont to the edge of recognizing gay
marriage, lawmakers still sought to preserve the term ''marriage''
for the union of a man and a woman, adopting an amendment making
that clear. That definition previously had existed only in the
bill's preamble and not in the text.
</P>
<P>
   ''This raises my comfort level,'' said Republican Rep. Bruce
Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   But the House also rejected an amendment that would have
prohibited Vermont from recognizing gay marriages performed
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The entire issue was forced on the Legislature because the state
Supreme Court ruled in December that same-sex couples are being
unconstitutionally denied the benefits of marriage. The high court
left it up to the Legislature to decide whether to allow gay
marriages or create some kind of domestic partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the bill said it far exceeded anything done by any
other state.
</P>
<P>
   ''Vermont is so far out on a limb by itself because there's
nothing close to it,'' said Vince McCarthy of the American Center
for Law and Justice. ''Even a state as liberal as Massachusetts
doesn't recognize domestic partnerships.''
</P>
<P>
   California comes closest. It started a domestic partnership
registry Jan. 1. Those listed as domestic partners are entitled to
hospital visitation rights, and state and local government workers
registered as domestic partners can get health care coverage
through their employers.
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, civil union partners also would be permitted to make
medical decisions on one another's behalf; they would be
responsible for one another's remains when one died; and they would
be able to inherit each other's estates without having to pay hefty
estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the excitement among gay rights advocates, there was
disappointment that Vermont did not simply approve gay marriage
outright.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an important start,'' Byron said. ''Vermont's not even
able to walk the whole road yet. But this beginning is so
crucial.''

   Dow Has Record Gain of 499.19
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow industrials roared nearly 500 points
higher today in a record-shattering rise as investors poured money
into blue chips that had been pared to bargain prices by Wall
Street's frenzy for technology stocks. And in a major reversal of
roles, the strength in industrial stocks helped pull technology
shares out of a three-day slump. The technology-laden Nasdaq
composite index, which fell steeply enough in the morning session
to tumble into what many on Wall Street consider a ''correction,''
ended sharply higher. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 499.19,
or 4.9 percent, to close at 10,630.60. That easily shattered the
previous record one-day rise of 380.53 points set Sept. 8, 1998,
but was not close to a record percentage gain. The Nasdaq ended up
134.67 at 4,717.29.

   Wholesale Prices Pushed Up By Fuel
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Huge increases in the price of gasoline and
home heating oil catapulted wholesale prices up by 1 percent in
February -- the biggest one-month surge in nearly a decade. The
worrisome jump in inflation didn't faze Wall Street, however, as
bargain hunters sent the Dow Jones industrial average soaring. The
bigger-than-expected spike in the Producer Price Index, which
measures inflation pressures before they reach consumers, came
after wholesale prices showed no change in January, the Labor
Department said today.

   After Dip, Mortgage Rates Inch Up
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mortgage rates inched up this week after
having slipped for three straight weeks. The average interest rate
on 30-year mortgages rose to 8.24 percent for the week ending
Friday, up from 8.23 percent the week ended March 10, according to
a weekly survey released by Freddie Mac, the mortgage company. In
mid-February, the rates on 30-year mortgages hit a 3{-year high of
8.38 percent. That was the highest since a 8.42 percent rate for
the week ended July 12, 1996.

   US Buys Back Part of National Debt
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Treasury, its coffers filled because of
budget surpluses, bought back another $1 billion of the national
debt today, one week after the first such repurchases in 70 years.
Because the government bought back older, outstanding 30-year
Treasury bonds that carry higher yields than the current market
yield on comparable securities, the Treasury Department paid
sellers $268 million in premiums to cash in their bonds early.
Treasury bought back 11 issues of 30-year bonds sold between May
1988 and November 1991. The bonds carried yields ranging from 7.875
percent to 9.125 percent.

   Euro Bank Raises Lending Rate

<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Taking action for the second time this
year to stem inflation in the 11 euro countries, the European
Central Bank raised its key interest rate today by a quarter-point
to 3.5 percent. Earlier this month, the European Union announced
that inflation hit 2 percent for January -- the upper limit for
inflation according to the ECB's own rules. ''Economic conditions
and prospects for the euro area appear to be better at present than
at any other time in the past decade,'' the governing board said in
a statement released after today's meeting. ''At the same time,
upside risk to price stability were seen as a reason for
vigilance.''

   BMW To Cast Off Part of Rover Unit
</P>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Automaker BMW announced plans today to
cast off its money-losing Rover passenger car unit, even though it
could cost up to $3 billion in restructuring charges to do so.
Under the plan, British investment group Alchemy Partners Ltd.,
will take on the Rover and MG brand cars, including their plant in
Longbridge, England, and recast the venture under the new name MG
Car Co. Over the past five years, those operations have burdened
BMW with $1.25 billion in red ink and dragged down profit an
estimated 28 percent last year alone. Alchemy said it would not be
buying the SUV line; however, the New York Times reported today
that Ford Motor Co was going to purchase it, citing executives
close to the talks. Ford declined to comment.

   FTC Charges 2 Drug Cos.
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission charged two drug
companies today with conspiring to keep generic versions of a
popular blood pressure drug off the market. At the same time the
commission said two other companies have agreed to settle a similar
complaint. The FTC charged that Hoechst Marion Roussel -- now known
as Aventis Pharmaceuticals -- paid Andrx Corporation to keep that
company from marketing a generic version of Cardizem CD, a widely
prescribed drug for treatment of hypertension and chest pain. Both
companies denied any wrongdoing.

   United Air Courts Gay Travelers
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Call them the Gay-Friendly Skies. United
Airlines, eager to mend a rift caused by a two-year boycott that
ended last summer when it agreed to offer domestic partner
benefits, is trying to become the ''official airline'' of gay men
and lesbians. ''Without a doubt, that's definitely the goal,'' said
Mario Baldessari, co-director of United's marketing effort to reach
gays. In doing so, United hopes to overtake American Airlines,
which many consider the airline of choice among gays. The marketing
effort, which includes an ad campaign launched in gay newspapers
late last year, has as much to do with business as with public
relations.

   Newspaper Circulation Change Mulled
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The main record-keeper of circulation data for
the newspaper industry is considering adjustments in the way
publishers report their circulation figures. One of the main
changes being considered by the Audit Bureau of Circulations
concerns a rule over pricing, which prevents newspapers and other
publications from counting as paid circulation any copies that are
sold for less than half of their set price, either on newsstands or
by subscription. Some newspaper publishers want to do away with the
so-called ''50 percent rule'' to allow themselves more flexibility
in the way they reach out to new readers through marketing and
promotion efforts, such as offering discounted copies.

<HEADLINE> Official: N.Korea Engagement Working  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A top State Department official said Thursday
the United States continues to take ''very slow, small steps
forward'' in its quest to bring stability to the Korean Peninsula
through engagement with North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting the argument of skeptics that the exercise is futile,
Ambassador Wendy Sherman highlighted North Korea's agreement to
freeze plutonium-producing nuclear facilities at two sites in 1994
and to renounce tests of long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is no small action,'' Sherman said. ''It's very hard to
continue a program if you don't test.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman, a top State Department aide on North Korea policy,
testified at a meeting of the House International Relations
Committee, whose chairman, Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., was
decidedly pessimistic about the administration's engagement policy.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that a CIA analysis found that, despite the missile
test moratorium, North Korea is continuing to develop the Taopo
Dong II intercontinental ballistic missile and could launch it
later this year if it decides to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman also alluded to CIA estimates that the missile would be
capable of delivering a several-hundred kilogram payload anywhere
in the United States. The agency concluded that Pyongyang is the
world's major supplier of ballistic missiles and technology, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's ranking Democrat, Sam Gejdenson, of Connecticut,
said he supports administration efforts to reach out to Pyongyang
but added that North Korea must realize that ''there is a limit to
the patience of the U.S. Congress and the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was held a day after the United States and North
Korea ended a week-long round of talks in New York, primarily on
the planned visit of a high-level North Korean official to
Washington in early spring.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman interpreted the inability of the two sides to set a date
as a ''breakdown'' but Sherman said the two sides intend to
reconvene the discussions shortly after consultations with their
respective capitals.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman also pointed out that North Korea agreed in New York to
convene talks on American concerns over North Korea's missile
program and on implementation of the U.S.-North Korean 1994 nuclear
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   She said that agreement ''continues to be our best means of
capping and eventually eliminating the threat of North Korean
nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the North's plutonium production not been frozen, Pyongyang
''would be well on its way to having a nuclear program capable of
producing dozens of nuclear weapons,'' Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said North Korea also has agreed to allow a
second U.S. inspection of a site where U.S. analysts believed North
Korea may have been producing nuclear weapons in secret. The first
inspection was held a year ago and yielded no evidence of any such
activity.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Monument Bill Could Face Veto  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An effort to protect a mountain range
overlooking Palm Springs, Calif., is well-intentioned but may still
generate a presidential veto, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before a House Resources subcommittee, Babbitt
praised Republican lawmakers for offering bills to create the Santa
Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument and to give more
protection to a desert area near Tucson, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   But Babbitt said the bill creating the monument fails to address
water issues and unnecessarily freezes current management practices
for three years. Babbitt said that would not allow federal land
managers to respond to changing conditions such as drought or
floods.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mary Bono, sponsor of the measure, said she was
disappointed but willing to work on a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would hate to see good legislation, that has been crafted
with the input of people who will be impacted the most, cast aside
in the pursuit of a bill that reflects only the Interior
Department's policies,'' said Bono, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed monument would encompass 272,000 acres of mountains
reaching to the edge of Palm Springs and neighboring communities.
National monuments include land-use restrictions, such as a ban on
mining, but are open to other uses, such as hunting, which is
banned in national parks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., is pushing legislation that
would create the Las Cienegas National Conservation Area in
southeastern Arizona. That designation does not include as many
land-use restrictions as a national monument.
</P>
<P>
   The Las Cienegas proposal would encompass about 207,000 acres,
although conservation rules would only apply to about 50,000 acres
of federal land in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said he found it ''strange and objectionable'' that the
bill would ban the federal government from buying any private land
in the conservation area, even if the owner was willing to sell.
However, he promised to work with Kolbe and did not threaten a
veto.
</P>
<P>
   National monument status can be granted either unilaterally by
the president or through an act of Congress. Clinton has created
three monuments on his own this year -- in Arizona and California.
</P>
<P>
   Republican critics say the president failed to get adequate
input from local residents before instituting land restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing upsets the Western members (of Congress) more than
that (monument issue),'' said subcommittee Chairman Jim Hansen,
R-Utah. ''Members are very uptight about it.''

<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Investors focused Thursday on old favorites stocks
instead of technology and telecommunications, pushing European
shares broadly higher.
</P>
<P>
   The European Central Bank's decision to increase a key rate by a
quarter-point had little effect on the markets, as a rise had been
expected this month.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks companies in
countries that joined the single currency, ended 5.71 points, or
1.3 percent higher, at 443.03. The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index
was up 92.1 points, or 1.8 percent, at 5,175.2.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of shares in European companies rose
5.02 points, or 1.3 percent, to 390.38, while the Dow Jones Stoxx
50 Index rose 65.9 points to 4933.9.
</P>
<P>
   Media, technology and telecommunications shares suffered, but
drugs, financials, food and beverage, consumer and non-cyclicals
rose.
</P>
<P>
   Brussels-based technology index Easdaq ended down 3.9 percent,
with ActivCard down 16.1 percent, while Check Point Software
Technologies lost 16 percent. London's TechMARK was down 5.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter have said they
expect a correction in new economy stocks, and Morgan Stanley has
called several ''old economy'' sectors very good value.
</P>
<P>
   In domestic markets, London's FTSE-100 Share Index rose 1.7
percent, to 6557.2.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, the CAC-40 Index was up 1.1 percent to 6,258.53.
Frankfurt's Xetra DAX Index rose 2.3 percent to 7,583.96, while and
Amsterdam's AEX Index was up 3.0 percent to 663.39.

<HEADLINE> Devils agree to sell to affiliate of YankeeNets  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- An affiliate of the company that
owns the New York Yankees and the New Jersey Nets agreed Thursday
to buy the New Jersey Devils for $175 million.
</P>
<P>
   The deal seems to clear the way for the NBA's Nets and NHL's
Devils to move from the Continental Airlines Arena in the
Meadowlands sports complex to a proposed arena to be built in
Newark, the state's largest city.
</P>
<P>
   However, sources familiar with negotiations told The Associated
Press that YankeeNets would consider a move to another spot in the
Garden State or a move out of New Jersey if the state did not
provide enough funding for a new arena.
</P>
<P>
   The deal between Puck Holdings and John J. McMullen is expected
to be finalized after the Eastern Conference-leading Devils finish
the hockey season, which would be no later than June. The NHL would
have to approve the sale.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our first goal is to be in Newark,'' said Harvey Schiller,
chairman and CEO of YankeeNets. But, he said, ''if Newark is not
possible, and that could be for a variety of reasons ... there are
other opportunities, yes, that's true.''
</P>
<P>
   The source told the AP that if Gov. Christie Whitman or Newark
officials don't provide enough funds for the Newark arena, ''the
Meadowlands is an alternative and out of state is an alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said Thursday that the state would commit funds,
although probably not more than the $75 million initially requested
by YankeeNets, to an arena with two teams.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most important thing for me was to keep the two teams in
New Jersey,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of the Devils and Nets have been asking the state for
years to help build a new arena to replace the 18-year-old
Continental Airlines Arena, but they have differed on where it
should be built. The Nets' new owners, led by philanthropist
Raymond Chambers, wanted it in Newark, while McMullen preferred
Hoboken.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, the quasi-state
organization that operates the Meadowlands, is proposing a new
arena in East Rutherford. The Nets have a lease with the authority
that expires in 2004 and the Devils have a lease until 2006-7, but
both teams can leave sooner if they pay penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets began negotiations about a year ago to buy the Devils
after Whitman said the state would not likely fund an arena unless
both teams agreed on one site.
</P>
<P>
   ''The decision to sell the team was a very difficult one, but it
is clear that the future success of the franchise can be assured
only by joining forces with the Nets in a new arena for the two
teams,'' McMullen said.
</P>
<P>
   Schiller said that Chambers and co-owner Lewis Katz formed Puck
Holdings last year as a vehicle to purchase the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Puck Holdings on Thursday wired a money transfer to McMullen
covering about half the sale price, the source told the AP.
</P>
<P>
   The source said Puck Holdings was formed because neither the
Nets nor YankeeNets had any more debt capacity, and the Yankees did
not want to take on any more debt.
</P>
<P>
   The source added that the company that applies to the NHL for
approval may not be called Puck Holdings, and it just may be
YankeeNets.
</P>
<P>
   Sports authority spokesman Dan Emmer said the agency would
present its new arena plans to both teams and called the sale good
for the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a chance both teams might have left New Jersey, and
now under one umbrella, it's virtually assured that they'll stay,''
Emmer said.
</P>
<P>
   McMullen, the only owner in the Devils' 18-year history, bought
the Colorado Rockies in 1982 and moved them to New Jersey, renaming
them the Devils. The 82-year-old almost sold the team to a
Nashville contingent in 1995, the only year the Devils won the
Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Newark Mayor Sharpe James said the arena should be built in the
area of Market, Lafayette and Mulberry streets to be close to
Newark Penn Station.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be irresponsible not to build a state-of-the-art
arena in the new millennium in an area where 90,000 people enter
the city of Newark from New York every day,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> 3 Indicted in School Shooting Case  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GOODMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. (AP) -- Three men, including the uncle of a
6-year-old boy accused of killing a classmate, have been indicted
on federal weapons charges for possessing the gun allegedly used in
the school shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment unsealed Thursday charges Jamelle Andre James,
19, Robert Lee Morris III, 19, and Sir Marcus Winfrey, 22, with
possessing stolen firearms and being unlawful users of marijuana in
possession of firearms, U.S. Attorney Saul Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Morris sold a stolen .32-caliber semiautomatic
handgun in December that wound up in the possession of James and
Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say that weapon eventually got into the hands of
Winfrey's nephew, the first-grader police say fatally shot Kayla
Rolland on Feb. 29 in Buell Elementary School in Mount Morris
Township, near Flint.
</P>
<P>
   The same handgun was found at the school shortly after the
shooting, and a stolen 12-gauge shotgun Morris also was accused of
selling in January was later found in the ''flophouse'' where the
boy had been staying, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Each charge carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison and a
$250,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   James, a friend of the boy's family, earlier had been charged
with involuntary manslaughter in Kayla's death for allegedly
leaving the handgun within easy access of the boy. He has been
jailed since his March 2.
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey has been in custody since the shooting on unrelated
charges. All three are from Mount Morris Township.
</P>
<P>
   Genesee County prosecutors say investigators believe the gun had
been left under James' blankets at the house where the boy was
staying with Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment, returned by grand jurors Wednesday, was unsealed
after Morris' arrest Thursday at his home.
</P>
<P>
   Morris posted bond and was released into his father's custody.
He was ordered to wear an electronic tether, spend weekends under
house arrest and remain home unless working.
</P>
<P>
   ''He hung around with the wrong people. He made a mistake, and
now he's going to pay for it,'' Robert Lee Morris II said about his
son.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say the boy told them he took the gun to school to
scare Kayla, with whom he had apparently quarreled, but ended up
killing her with one shot. Prosecutors have said they will not
charge the boy because he is too young to understand his actions.
</P>
<P>
   James and Winfrey were to be arraigned on the federal charges
either Friday or next week.

<HEADLINE> Euro Gets Boost Against Dollar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A rate increase from the European Central Bank
gave the euro a much-needed boost against the dollar Thursday,
while the dollar was caught in a tight range against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The euro was trading at 97.10 cents in late New York dealings,
up from 96.73 cents Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's common currency rose against the dollar after the ECB
raised its key interest rate by a quarter-point to 3.5 percent
Thursday. It was the second rate increase the bank has made this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said, however, that the euro's gains may be short-lived
since the Federal Reserve is expected to raise U.S. rates at its
meeting next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar was stuck in a tight range against the Japanese yen
amid the threat of further market intervention from the Bank of
Japan. The bank has bought dollars for yen twice over the past two
weeks in order to stem the rise in the yen, which was threatening
to choke the profits of Japanese exporters.
</P>
<P>
   In late New York trading the dollar was quoted at 105.56
Japanese yen, off slightly from its late Wednesday level of 105.57
yen.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar also was quoted at 1.6600 Swiss francs, down from
1.6657, and 1.4743 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4667. The British
pound rose to $1.5758 from $1.5726.
</P>
<P>
   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate.
Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 2.0142 German
marks, down from 2.0221; 6.7555 French francs, down from 6.7817;
and 1,994.08 Italian lire, down from 2,001.83.

<HEADLINE> Helicopters Needed in Madagascar  </HEADLINE>
By KATYA ROBINSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar (AP) -- Only about one-third of hundreds
of tons of food donated to flood-ravaged Madagascar has been
delivered to hungry victims because of a lack of aircraft, aid
officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Many roads on this Indian Ocean island nation are washed out or
blocked by landslides. The government and the U.N. World Food
Program has appealed for more aircraft to bring food and supplies
to people in isolated areas.
</P>
<P>
   Only 151 tons of 435 tons of donated food have been distributed,
the national disaster committee said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The largest concentration of homeless people -- more than 11,000
-- were in the Vatomandy area about 90 miles southeast of the
capital of Antananarivo, said WFP spokeswoman Heather Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ''We urgently need to get food there to stop people from
suffering any more than they have,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday afternoon, a French plane took off for a parachute
drop of 7 tons of sugar, beans and rice over Anosibe an'Ala, a town
about 80 miles southeast of Antananarivo.
</P>
<P>
   The road leading to Anosibe an'Ala has been cut by landslides in
30 places, stranding the population of 75,000, the Adventist
Development and Relief Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   While flooding has not been as severe in Madagascar as in
Mozambique to the west, it has killed at least 130 people on the
island and damaged much of the country's agricultural land. The
floods have also worsened a cholera epidemic that has killed more
than 1,350 people in one year.
</P>
<P>
   The French aircraft carrier Jeanne d'Arc left Madagascar on
Thursday after a three-day mission in the north. Two of its
helicopters brought food into some flooded regions early on
Tuesday, but two days of rain prevented further missions, French
military officials said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Has Record Gain of 499.19  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow industrials rocketed almost 500 points
Thursday in a record-shattering rally as investors poured money
into blue chips that had been battered by Wall Street's frenzy for
technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   It was a stunning reversal of fortunes and came on the busiest
day ever in the history of the New York Stock Exchange. In just two
days, the Dow stocks wiped out more than 40 percent of their losses
over the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-focused Nasdaq Stock Market, which this week was
swooning sharply from record heights, rode the Dow's coattails to a
sharp gain.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, however, tempered their enthusiasm, wary that the
rally might be nothing more than another volatile day in a volatile
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's too soon to tell whether this is anything more than a
short-term head fake,'' said David G. Sowerby, vice president at
Loomis, Sayles &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow closed up 499.19, or 4.9 percent, at 10,630.60, smashing
the previous record point gain of 380.53 on Sept. 8, 1998, but
nowhere near the record 15.34 percent jump in 1933.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, whose losses had fueled the Dow's
rise, rebounded to close up 134.77, or 2.9 percent at 4,717.39,
after being down as much as 127 points early in the day.
</P>
<P>
   On the heels of Wednesday's 320-point gain, the rally helped the
Dow gain back a stunning 42 percent of the losses recorded since it
peaked at 11,722.98 on Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
   But even with its unprecedented two-day rally, the Dow remained
9.3 percent below its Jan. 14 record of 11,722.98.
</P>
<P>
   While the market's early strength Thursday came from
long-scorned industrial stocks, the euphoria ultimately lifted
technology stocks, which had driven the Nasdaq down 465 points in
the past three sessions.
</P>
<P>
   At the depths of its decline Thursday, the Nasdaq was down 11.8
percent from last Friday's record of 5,048.62. With its recovery
later in the day, its decline was cut to 6.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A drop of more than 10 percent is considered a signal of a
''correction,'' or downturn in a rising market, but not necessarily
a change to a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   The best evidence that corrections don't last forever came from
the Dow. Investors' willingness to dump blue-chip stocks in favor
of technology shares pushed the Dow into a correction in
mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   Now, many of the blue chips that had been beaten down are
enticing investors as relative bargains. Johnson &AMP; Johnson rose 2~
to 79 13/16, 3M rose 5 9/16 to 88 1/16 and General Electric gained
5 7/16 to 139.
</P>
<P>
   Also, American Express rose 10~ to 143} and J.P. Morgan gained
8[ to 124|.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the session, the Nasdaq appeared poised to continue
its decline, which most analysts considered a healthy development
for a sector that had advanced too far and too fast.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of these high-growth stocks had gotten to such extreme
valuations,'' said Matt Finn, chief investment officer of the
growth and income group at Evergreen Funds in Boston. ''They were
due to come down.''
</P>
<P>
   But after only three days of heavy selling, investors began
returning to some technology favorites that have slipped this week.
Amgen rose 6\ to 64} and PMC-Sierra, which makes components for the
semiconductor industry, shot up 18} to 204}.
</P>
<P>
   A record 1.48 billion shares changed hands on the NYSE as of the
4 p.m. EST closing bell, surpassing the previous high of 1.35
billion set on Dec. 17, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy volume underscored the market's volatility. Some of
the gyrations were magnified because Friday is a
''triple-witching'' session, a quarterly event when contracts on
stock options, index options, and index futures contracts all
expire. Those expirations often cause traders to shift in and out
of their positions.
</P>
<P>
   But more fundamentally, the market's lofty levels make it
vulnerable to wider point swings. Years ago, a day in which the Dow
moved up or down more than 100 points was considered remarkable. In
the 52 trading days since Jan. 1, the Dow has subjected traders to
27 doses of triple-digit moves either up or down.
</P>
<P>
   ''At these levels, you're going to get shakeouts from time to
time,'' Sowerby said.
</P>
<P>
   The government delivered mixed news on inflation Thursday which,
on a less optimistic day, could have hampered stocks. The Producer
Price Index showed that wholesale prices surged 1 percent in
February, the largest gain in nearly 10 years, as gasoline, home
heating oil and other energy costs rose.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation figures, including the Consumer Price Index due for
release on Friday, are sure to be closely watched by the Federal
Reserve as it weighs whether higher interest rates are needed to
cool the economy. In a continuing effort to keep inflation at bay,
the Fed has raised rates four times since last June, and it meets
again Tuesday, when investors are expecting a fifth rate hike.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors were heartened by the fact that the ''core''
rate of inflation at the wholesale level, which excludes the
volatile energy and food categories, matched expectations with a
0.3 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market improved modestly, lending support to stocks.
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 6.04 percent from
6.07 percent late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 66.32 to 1,458.47, and the
Russell 2000 index of smaller companies soared 15.36 to 574.24.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-2 margin on the
NYSE.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.9 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index rose 2.3 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
rose 1.7 percent, and France's CAC-40 gained 1.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Koehler Appears Likely To Head IMF  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, trying to
patch damaged relations with a major ally, said he had a ''warm''
initial meeting Thursday with Horst Koehler, the second German
official put forward to head the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Summers said the two discussed a range of international economic
issues pending before the IMF. Summers said he knew of no remaining
opposition to Koehler's candidacy, which was expected to be
approved in coming days by the IMF's executive board.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a very warm meeting and a good discussion,'' Summers
told reporters after congressional testimony. ''I said at the end
that I expected it to be the first of many, and I look forward to
our subsequent meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   Summers said he did not discuss any specific reform proposals
for the IMF, which has come under heavy criticism in Congress for
its handling of the Asian currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler arrived in Washington on Wednesday for a round of talks
with the Clinton administration, IMF officials and representatives
of Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
   It was expected that the IMF's 24-member executive board will
now move quickly to endorse Koehler, who was put forward by German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder after Germany's first candidate for
the post, Caio Koch-Weser, was rejected by the United States as
lacking sufficient stature.
</P>
<P>
   By unwritten rules over the past half-century, the IMF job has
always been held by a European while an American has occupied the
top job at the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of countries, including Japan, expressed
unhappiness at this state of affairs and indicated they wanted a
more open nominating process the next time around.
</P>
<P>
   IMF Deputy Managing Director Stanley Fischer, the only remaining
candidate in the race, officially withdrew Thursday. His candidacy
had been put forward by African nations contending the views of
developing countries were being ignored in the IMF leadership
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer described his meeting with Koehler as ''excellent'' and
said, ''I am confident under his leadership the fund will become an
even more effective institution.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Jose Pedro de Marais, the IMF executive board
member representing the 20 African nations who had nominated
Fischer, said they would continue to push for changes. He said the
current process ''seriously detracts from the serious work we are
engaged in.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan, the world's second largest economy, on Wednesday withdrew
its candidate, former finance ministry official Eisuke Sakakibara,
but issued a strong statement that Japan also would push for
changes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Japan is not going to keep silent about the monopolization of
that position by European candidates,'' said Akitaka Saiki, a
spokesman for Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler, a former official in Germany's finance ministry, is
currently the head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, the London-based lending institution created to help
Russia and other former communist nations in Europe transform to
capitalist economies. Koehler would succeed Michel Camdessus, who
stepped down in mid-February after 13 years as head of the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer, a naturalized American who was born in what is now
Zambia, was Camdessus' deputy and right-hand man in dealing with
the financial crises that hit Asia in the past two years.

<HEADLINE> Money Funds Rose in Latest Week  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's retail money market
mutual funds rose by $7.56 billion in the latest week to $997.47
billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category rose
by $6.94 billion to $830.01 billion for the week ended Wednesday,
the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. Tax-exempt fund
assets rose by $618.2 million to $167.46 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Assets of institutional money market funds fell by $9.29 billion
to $707.31 billion for the same period. Among institutional funds,
taxable money market fund assets fell by $9.53 billion to $654.99
billion; assets of tax-exempt funds rose by $237.8 million to
$52.32 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Total money market assets stood at $1.705 trillion for the week.
</P>
<P>
   Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.707 trillion to
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds
reporting.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 5.28 percent from 5.26 percent the
previous week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal
published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial Data Inc. The 30-day
average yield rose to 5.26 percent from 5.24 percent, IBC Financial
Data said.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-day compounded yield rose to 5.42 percent from 5.40
percent the previous week, and the 30-day compounded yield rose to
5.40 percent from 5.38 percent, IBC Financial Data said.
</P>
<P>
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds
remained unchanged at 48 days, IBC Financial Data said.
</P>
<P>
   The online service bankrate.com said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage
yield available on money market accounts held steady at 2.04
percent as of Wednesday from a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based unit of Intelligent Life Corp.
said the annual percentage yield available on interest-bearing
checking accounts kept at 0.83 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bankrate.com said the annual percentage yield held steady at
4.85 percent on six-month certificates of deposit, unchanged from
the previous week. Yields were 5.28 percent on 1-year CDs, up from
5.25 percent; 5.56 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 5.54 percent;
and 5.93 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 5.91 percent.

<HEADLINE> Musician Plugs Child Support Bill  </HEADLINE>
By G. STEPHEN BIERMAN Jr., Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-Calif., and the mother of
rock group Everclear singer Art Alexakis have one thing in common --
deadbeat husbands drove both to welfare by refusing to pay child
support.
</P>
<P>
   Alexakis flew here Thursday from California to talk about his
father in an effort to plug a bill that would require employers to
deduct child support, like taxes, from a worker's paycheck. The
deduction would appear on an employee's W-4 form and would be
enforced by the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS has a much better record collecting what it's owed than
the states do at enforcing child support collections, said Woolsey,
who co-authored the bill with House Judiciary Committee Chairman
Henry Hyde, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know that the IRS gives many people heartburn, but the
Hyde-Woolsey bill will take advantage of that heartburn and the
power of the IRS and put that power behind our children,'' Woolsey
said.
</P>
<P>
   Delinquent parents currently owe 30 million children nearly $50
billion, said Geraldine Jensen President of the Association for
Children for Enforcement of Support.
</P>
<P>
   Everclear's song ''Father of Mine,'' which told the story of
Alexakis' father's desertion, garnered an award from Jensen's
association and drew the attention of legislators.
</P>
<P>
   ''This isn't a sexy issue,'' Alexakis said. ''It isn't hanging
out with Sting in the rain forests; it just ain't the same. This is
our children, our future. We complain about the way things are
going today. It's not going to get any better until we teach our
children responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexakis battled problems with drugs and the law before getting
sober and writing songs.
</P>
<P>

   The bill number is H.R. 1488.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- President Clinton asked a court
committee to wait until after he leaves office next year to
consider disbarring him for his testimony in the Monica Lewinsky
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the deadline for Clinton to respond to complaints
against him, his private lawyer David Kendall asked for more time
under Arkansas Supreme Court rules that allow extensions of a

   Kendall said in a statement he asked that the president be given
until next Feb. 19, 2001 -- 30 days after he leaves the White House
-- to respond to the complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily an extension is 30 days, but Clinton is asking for
more time because of the unique responsibilities of a sitting
president. Kendall made his arguments in sealed court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Signaling his intention to fight the complaints, the president
renewed his law license Feb. 29 for a $100 fee.
</P>
<P>
   A complaint before the Arkansas Supreme Court's professional
conduct committee arose automatically under state law when U.S.
District Judge Susan Webber Wright found Clinton in contempt of
court last April 12 because of his testimony in the Paula Jones
sexual harassment lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Wright said Clinton gave ''false, misleading and evasive answers
that were designed to obstruct the judicial process.''
</P>
<P>
   She cited 10 specific instances in which Clinton denied that he
had sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky and said he could not recall
being alone with her. Wright specified civil, not criminal,
contempt in order to preserve the independent counsel's option of
prosecuting Clinton after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier complaint on similar grounds was filed in September
1998, in the midst of the impeachment drama in Congress, by the
conservative Southeastern Legal Foundation of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president wants to delay the process for protecting the
public and that is unconscionable,'' said Matt Glavin, head of the
legal foundation. ''This is not reasonable by any measure.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavin said if the committee grants the extension, he will
complain to the state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   James Neal, executive director of the professional conduct
committee, did not act on the complaints until this year, after the
state Supreme Court ordered him to do so on Jan. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Glavin argued the White House could not use the excuse that
Clinton was too busy as president to deal with the case because he
had attended seven fund-raisers in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''That doesn't pass the straight-face test,'' Glavin said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bruce Fein, a former Justice Department official and
conservative writer, said such a request from Clinton would likely
be honored.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is preposterous to think that the disciplinary panel would
not grant Mr. Clinton a post-White House delay,'' Fein wrote in a
newspaper column before Thursday's court filing. He said the case
is not urgent because Clinton isn't practicing law in Arkansas and
earlier court rulings in the Jones case said the needs of his
office should be taken into consideration.

<HEADLINE> First Atomic Bombardier Dies at 81  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDERMERE, Fla. (AP) -- Thomas Wilson Ferebee, the bombardier
who dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima in World War II, died
Thursday. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   Ferebee was 26 on Aug. 6, 1945, and already a major and a
veteran of 64 missions when the B-29 Enola Gay took off for Japan
with the first nuclear weapon ever deployed.
</P>
<P>
   Ferebee, who retired from the Air Force as a colonel in 1970,
said he never felt guilty but was sorry the bomb killed so many.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sorry an awful lot of people died from that bomb, and I
hate to think that something like that had to happen to end the
war,'' he said in a 1995 interview on the 50th anniversary of the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we should look back and remember what just one bomb did,
or two bombs,'' he said. ''Then I think we should realize that this
can't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   America's bombing of Hiroshima and the blast at Nagasaki three
days later left more than 100,000 dead and led to the end of the
war.
</P>
<P>
   The only other man who has dropped a nuclear bomb in war,
Nagasaki bombardier Kermit Beahan, died in 1989. Japan surrendered
on Aug. 14, 1945, five days after the Nagasaki bomb was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   The Enola Gay's pilot, retired Brig. Gen. Paul Tibbets, had
hand-picked Ferebee for his crew and called him ''the best
bombardier who ever looked through the eyepiece of a Norden bomb
site.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferebee's death leaves only four surviving members of the Enola
Gay's crew: Tibbets, navigator Ted Van Kirk, weapons officer Morris
Jeppson and radio operator Richard Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Ferebee also participated in the first U.S. bombing raid on Nazi
occupied France in 1942 and was the lead bombardier for the Allies'
first 100-plane daylight raid in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, he served as a deputy commander for
maintenance in several B-47 Stratojet bomber wings. He flew aboard
B-47s during the Cold War and B-52s during the Vietnam War. His
decorations included the Silver Star, Legion of Merit, two
Distinguished Flying Crosses and the Bronze Star.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife, Mary Ann Conrad Ferebee, and four
sons.

<HEADLINE> R.I. Students Protest Suspension  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL MELLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- About 50 college students gathered
Thursday to protest what they called a violation of free speech
involving an abortion-rights flier that used the image of the
Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Three of their fellow students at Providence College used the
flier, which read: ''How's this for an immaculate concept: Keep
Abortion Safe and Legal,'' to spark a debate on the Catholic
campus.
</P>
<P>
   But their action came at a price: They have been suspended for
the rest of the semester.
</P>
<P>
   In response, about 50 angry students congregated for a silent
protest outside the school's administration building, carrying
signs with messages like, ''The first amendment does not stop at
the gates of PC. Protect your rights.'' and ''Do I pay for you to
oppress me?''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're speaking to our right to free speech and to protest the
administration's action,'' said sophomore Devan Chase, 20.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Pastrana, whose brother Daniel is one of the suspended
students, said the incident has cost his brother a full tuition
scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's crushed, devastated. He's really shocked and appalled,''
said Pastrana, of Stratford, Conn., 18.
</P>
<P>
   The college said the student can reapply for the scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   One professor criticized the school, saying it should have used
the opportunity to explain to the students why people were offended
by what they did, instead of suspending them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're supposed to be here to share ideas and debate,'' said
John Colby, who teaches psychology. ''We're providing opportunity
for people to express different points of view. It's not as though
they committed some crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the protesters was a student who supported the
administration's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''The right to free speech is not all encompassing,'' said
junior Stephanie Fitzgerald, 20.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fliers themselves were a defamation of the image of the
Virgin Mary. It's a Catholic institution's duty to uphold the
teachings of the faith.''
</P>
<P>
   The three students were posting the notices on a classroom door
last month when a priest who teaches theology arrived to prepare
for a lecture. He ordered them to stop and reported the incident to
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Along with senior Daniel Pastrana, junior Patrick Moran and
sophomore Christopher White were suspended last month.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Philip Smith, the college president, called the flier a
''deliberate misuse of a venerated person.''
</P>
<P>
   The school released a statement Thursday in response to the
protest, calling the flier deplorable.
</P>
<P>
   ''The deliberate misuse of the image of the Blessed Virgin ...
cannot be defended under the guise of 'free speech,''' the school
said. ''We don't dispute their opinion, but rather how it was
expressed.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the college newspaper, the students wrote that
the flier was meant to shock, not insult. ''We hoped that the
explicit nature of the imagery would add a more personal dimension
to the issue,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Brown, executive director of the American Civil Liberties
Union in Rhode Island, said any legal challenge to the punishment
would probably fail since the First Amendment does not apply to
private colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Providence College is a liberal arts school where more than 80
percent of the 3,700 students are Roman Catholic and many Dominican
friars and nuns are on the faculty.

<HEADLINE> Report: Ocean City roller coaster malfunctioned before fatalaccident  </HEADLINE>
AP Photo
<TEXT>
<P>
   OCEAN CITY, N.J. (AP) -- A roller coaster where two people died
last summer had malfunctioned less than two hours before, injuring
two passengers, according to a report published Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The injured riders say they warned officials at Gillian's
Wonderland Pier that the Wild Wonder had problems but it stayed
open. One hour and 15 minutes later, a woman and her 8-year-old
daughter died on the ride.
</P>
<P>
   Gillian's and coaster manufacturer Zamperla Co. of Italy both
deny responsibility for the Aug. 28 accident, which killed Kim
Bailey, 39, of Pomona, N.Y., and her daughter, Jessica.
</P>
<P>
   The two were ejected after the coaster car they were riding in
plunged backward as it was ascending an incline.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told this guy over and over again, 'You have to stop this
ride,''' Alexis McCann, of Swarthmore, Pa., told The Press of
Atlantic City in Thursday's editions. ''I wanted to make him
promise to stop the ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Park General Manager Jay Gillian disputed McCann's claims,
saying park personnel had no warning the ride would malfunction
that night.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the ride was unsafe, we would have closed it down,''
Gillian told the newspaper. ''Everyone is going to come out of the
woodwork and say whatever. But if there was any inkling that ride
was dangerous, we would have closed it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Lary Zucker, an attorney for the park, said Thursday that the
Wild Wonder was shut down and tested after the McCanns' experience
but that it ran smoothly. He said the malfunction that occurred
during their ride was not related to the one that caused the fatal
accident later.
</P>
<P>
   The problem in the first accident was with a ''chain dog,'' the
device that connects the car to the track, he said. The car's
anti-rollback device, which was blamed for the fatal accident,
wasn't involved, Zucker said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There wasn't any suggestion by her at the time that you should
shut the ride down,'' Zucker said. ''Nevertheless, we shut the ride
down, checked out the cars, ran the cars on some loops around the
ride. Everything functioned properly. We allowed the ride to
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   The revelation about the prior incident came in an accident
report filed with the state Department of Community Affairs by
Gillian's on Aug. 30. It was obtained by the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   McCann and her daughter, Katy, 9, told employees their coaster
car ''went forward and back about five times in (the) middle of
(the) ride.'' McCann said she suffered shoulder and neck injuries;
her daughter bumped her head and bled slightly. Only the daughter's
injury was listed on the report.
</P>
<P>
   The two went to a Guest Services window to inform the park that
the ride had malfunctioned, then went to a first aid station, where
the girl was given an ice pack, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the state Department of Community Affairs, which
regulates amusement rides in New Jersey, said the park was not
obligated to close the ride after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the park must notify the state within 24 hours about any
injuries that require first aid, Community Affairs spokesman E.J.
Miranda said. But under state law, the ride would only have to have
been closed if the victims were taken away in ambulances, Miranda
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was their choice,'' he said of the park's decision to
keep the ride open.
</P>
<P>
   Just before 10 p.m., McCann and her daughter returned to see the
Wild Wonder was still operating. McCann said she witnessed the
fatal accident.
</P>
<P>
   ''We saw the car hit the other car at the bottom. I looked up
and saw everyone grabbing their kids and running away from the
ride,'' McCann said. ''It didn't even hit me until the next day. I
was horrified. I hadn't realized anyone had been killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillian's Wonderland Pier was fined $25,000 in February for
safety violations related to the fatal accident, and the
manufacturer was fined $30,000. The state blamed worn teeth on a
replacement brake for the accident, but also said a safety
restraint bar was improperly adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   The ride was being dismantled Thursday. Piece by piece, the
cranes lifted white support beams and green sections of track off
the structure and lowered them to closed Wayne Avenue below, where
workers stacked them or loaded them onto one of two
tractor-trailers.
</P>
<P>
   Workers declined comment on the operation, refusing to say where
the pieces of the Wild Wonder were being shipped. A park employee
in the Guest Services office, who would not give his name, referred
inquiries to Zucker.
</P>
<P>
   McCann didn't return a telephone call Thursday, nor did Michael
Grossman, attorney for John Bailey, the husband of Kim Bailey.

<HEADLINE> Irish gays and lesbians welcomed by Manhattan borough president  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Gay people in Ireland have one right they don't
have in New York: They're allowed to march as official groups in
St. Patrick's Day parades.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm lesbian, queer, Irish,'' announced Ailbhe Smyth, head of
women's studies at University College in Dublin. ''But I have to
say that in Ireland, we no longer have this kind of intolerance,
this kind of homophobia, this kind of discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   She and 52 other Irish gays and lesbians were welcomed by the
Manhattan borough president on Thursday, the eve of America's
oldest and biggest St. Patrick's Day parade.
</P>
<P>
   This year marks the 10th time that the New York-based ILGO, the
Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization, has been banned from making the
march up Fifth Avenue under its own banner.
</P>
<P>
   The group's members aren't taking it calmly.
</P>
<P>
   Joined by the Irish contingent, ILGO planned a massive civil
disobedience march down Fifth Avenue -- the opposite direction -- for
about an hour before the official parade starts Friday morning.
ILGO predicted participation by thousands in its protest from 59th
Street to 42nd Street.
</P>
<P>
   As has become traditional, some will then turn around and try to
join the actual parade. Those who fail to heed police warnings face
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The 239th annual march will feature shamrocks and ''Kiss me, I'm
Irish'' buttons.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the protesters are expected to wear ''Kiss me, I'm
queer'' buttons -- as they did Thursday afternoon for the reception
in the office of Manhattan Borough President C. Virginia Fields.
</P>
<P>
   She said she had marched with Martin Luther King in the 1960s.
And now, she said, she's fighting for passage of state hate crimes
legislation that would ''strongly demonstrate that society will not
allow people to be victimized and attacked.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ancient Order of Hibernians, a fraternal Catholic group that
runs the official parade, has repeatedly maintained its right to
exclude ILGO. And in February, a Manhattan federal jury ruled that
the city had not violated the group's First Amendment rights by
denying it a marching permit.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani will be toward the front of the
parade.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he'll have a new political opponent following him.
U.S. Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton will walk up Fifth on
St. Patrick's for her first time -- against ILGO's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Though she joined an inclusive Queens parade recently, ''it
doesn't matter where else you march, how many times you march, or
what spin you put on marching -- what matters is integrity,'' ILGO
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   One major figure may be missing this year: 80-year-old Cardinal
John O'Connor, whose health has been failing since he underwent
brain surgery in September. Church officials said he probably will
not greet marchers as he usually does.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday in Fields' office, Catholicism was not missing from
the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Bridget Roche, a lesbian from Cork, Ireland, wore a gold cross
around her neck and noted, ''I go to Mass.''
</P>
<P>
   At home in Ireland, said the 30-year-old chef, ''there's not
that much discrimination. Here, we're hidden away.''
</P>
<P>
   ILGO supporter David Robinson, who was master of ceremonies for
the borough president's reception, reminded the more than 100
guests that in New York, ''people are fond of saying that on St.
Patrick's Day, everyone is Irish. That is, unless you're lesbian or
gay.''

<HEADLINE> Kohl Aide Refuses To Testify  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- The first witness in a parliamentary inquiry
remained silent Thursday on allegations that he managed a web of
secret accounts at the heart of the slush fund scandal surrounding
former Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
   Horst Weyrauch, the Christian Democratic party's former
financial adviser, said he could not discuss whether donors bought
political favors because he faces possible criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Weyrauch, 67, was called before the parliamentary investigating
committee set up after Kohl admitted in December that he accepted
undeclared -- and thus illegal -- campaign donations while he was
chancellor in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are examining allegations that Weyrauch funneled
millions of dollars to and from secret accounts in Switzerland and
Liechtenstein to avoid reporting requirements under German party
financing laws.
</P>
<P>
   Among the questions Weyrauch refused to answer was whether he
wrote a 1978 study on party financing that concluded that laws at
the time had a loophole because they contained no provisions for
punishing violators.
</P>
<P>
   Committee members from the Social Democrat-led governing
coalition argued that Weyrauch had no blanket immunity from
testifying. The panel summoned Weyrauch again for March 23.
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of further clearing up the scandal, the Christian
Democrats released a report Thursday by auditors that found an
additional $4.7 million was held in secret accounts between 1989
and 1992. An earlier audit found more than $6 million from
undetermined sources from 1989-1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have laid everything out on the table and done everything
that is possible,'' party general manager Willi Hausmann said.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl, meanwhile, was to return Friday to his seat in parliament,
three months after withdrawing into seclusion because of the
scandal. He has rejected demands by his own party to give up his
seat, noting that it gives him immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl has also refused to reveal the sources of $1 million he
says he secretly accepted from supporters in the 1990s. He says he
gave them his word.
</P>
<P>
   His stance has led to speculation that government favors were
traded for campaign donations, something Kohl denies.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl was German chancellor for 16 years until 1998 and led the
Christian Democrats for 25 years,
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he announced he had collected $2.1 million from
supporters to cover potential fines against his party for his
action.

<HEADLINE> Police Probe College Drinking Death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIG RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- Police are investigating the death of a
19-year-old college student whose blood-alcohol level was .42
percent, four times the legal limit for driving while under the
influence.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary autopsy results show Stephen Petz, a Ferris State
University student, died early Wednesday of alcohol poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   No charges have been filed, but Big Rapids Director of Public
Safety Kevin Courtney said his department is interviewing a dozen
people believed to have been at the off-campus party where Petz was
drinking.
</P>
<P>
   ''The person or persons who purchased or provided the alcohol
could be charged with a 10-year-felony,'' Courtney said. ''There
has to be some responsibility taken ... when you keep feeding
alcohol to someone and they die.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferris State and Big Rapids have been taking a number of steps
to curb alcohol abuse among students, including alcohol-free social
activities, alcohol safety education, and alcohol poisoning
recognition and first-aid training.
</P>
<P>
   Last school year, two people died at Ferris State after evenings
of drinking.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Chides Elian's Fla. Family  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- The Miami relatives of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez
have repeatedly prevented the boy's father from talking to him on
the telephone in recent days, the Cuban government said in a
statement published Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly daily accounting of Juan Miguel Gonzalez's attempts
to communicate with his son was published in the Communist Party
daily Granma. It said the Miami relatives typically argue with or
hang up on the father, tell him the boy is not home or is sleeping,
distract the boy during his conversations with his father or simply
do not pick up the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ''The methods used by the sadly celebrated great-uncle Lazaro
Gonzalez and his nuclear family to impede and block (the calls) are
increasingly more cruel and cynical,'' Granma said.
</P>
<P>
   While the father had fought to bring Elian back to Cuba, Lazaro
Gonzalez has had temporary custody of Elian since shortly after the
boy was rescued by fishermen off the coast of Florida on Nov. 25.
Elian's mother and 10 others perished at sea when their boat sank
during a journey from Cuba to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The great uncle seeks to keep Elian in Miami, saying that he can
give him a better life off the communist island. Elian's Miami
relatives are awaiting a ruling from U.S. District Judge K. Michael
Moore, who heard arguments last week on whether to interfere with a
federal immigration decision to send Elian back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Granma said Cuba's Foreign Ministry has been tracking the
complaints about the phone calls and passing them on to the U.S.
State Department and Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Gutierrez, a spokesman for the Miami relatives, denied
the Cuban account.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe anything that comes out of Havana. It's
another creation of Fidel Castro. This is the United States of
America, people get to go out. Or sometimes he might be asleep,''
he said. ''I've been there, I've seen him talk to his father for
long periods of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Osberg-Braun, an attorney for the Miami relatives, said
the INS and Lazaro set up a schedule for specific times when Juan
Miguel could call and the relatives would try to make sure Elian
would be there. She said that when Juan Miguel learned of the
schedule, he called and yelled at the relatives, saying he would
call his son anytime he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Osberg-Braun said the relatives are now contemplating taping the
calls in accordance with Florida law, which requires all parties to
know they're being taped.

<HEADLINE> Halt to Serb Media Crackdown Urged  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- After Yugoslav officials shut down
the sixth independent broadcaster in just over a week, Serbian
opposition parties and media called for action Friday to halt the
media crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   President Slobodan Milosevic's government shut down the local
television station in the opposition-run southeastern town of Pirot
Thursday morning and police carted away its transmission equipment,
B2-92 radio in Belgrade reported.
</P>
<P>
   Staff arriving at the transmitter station found barbed wire
around the facility cut, the door lock broken and the equipment
missing.
</P>
<P>
   Radio manager Boban Nikolic said the station had received no
prior notice about the shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday evening, about 1,000 citizens rallied in Pirot to
protest the closure of their television, Beta news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirot television the sixth independent TV or radio station
to have been closed or had its equipment confiscated by the
telecommunications ministry since last Thursday. The government has
claimed the stations worked without license or owed money to the
state.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Thursday, carried by the official Tanjug news
agency, the ministry said the Pirot television would be allowed to
operate once it fulfilled unspecified legal conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's opponents gained control over dozens of local media
outlets after they won municipal elections in many Serbian cities
in 1996. The government crackdown against independent media is
widely seen as Milosevic's attempt to minimize critical reporting
ahead of municipal elections later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Veran Maric, head of an independent network of local television
and radio stations, called Thursday for urgent action to prevent
the government from closing down any more stations. Matic announced
formation of a team to plot strategy against the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   In the central Serbian town of Cacak, the opposition mayor
Velimir Ilic warned that if the government tried to close down the
local television the citizens would ''block the town.'' He added
the local authorities in Cacak have already organized guards around
the transmission facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ''The regime continues with the confrontation with its citizens
and it is time that those in opposition who bear responsibility for
the destiny of their own country, come up with a more radical
response to the government terror,'' opposition leader Zarko Korac
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of opposition parties have joined forces in their efforts
to oust Milosevic, but have so far had little result.

<HEADLINE> Congress approves new protections for traveling pets  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress has approved new regulations that
will force U.S. airlines to compile and release information on
dogs, cats and other animals injured or killed while traveling.
</P>
<P>
   The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
hailed ''a stunning win for animals that must travel by air.'' But
the airline industry warned that some airlines may choose to stop
accepting animals.
</P>
<P>
   Congress took on the issue in response to reports of pets hurt
or killed by rough handling on the ground, or by temperature
extremes and oxygen depletion in the air. Under the new rules,
domestic airlines will have to begin reporting animal losses,
injuries or deaths to the federal Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Transport Association says that ''more than 99 percent
of the estimated 500,000 dogs and cats that airlines handle each
year'' reach their destination without incident. Critics say that
means up to 5,000 pets are hurt, killed or lost each year; the
industry says the 1 percent or less includes cases of pets turned
away due to inadequate cages or veterinary papers.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Agriculture reported in 1998 that, in the
previous five years, it had documented 2,516 instances of dogs and
cats ''severely affected'' by extreme temperatures, with 108 dogs
and cats dying as a result.
</P>
<P>
   In one 1997 case, Donna and Stephen Calk of Denver, Colo., went
to baggage claim after a flight from New Jersey to Los Angeles and
found their golden retriever, Jed, not breathing and covered in
urine, feces, and vomit. An autopsy revealed the dog had died of
suffocation due to lack of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., who proposed the new regulations,
cited the Calk case as a ''horror story.'' The Senate last year
approved Lautenberg's proposal as part of an aviation bill, but the
House did not act on a companion proposal by Rep. Robert Menendez,
D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A House-Senate conference committee approved some of the
regulations. The conference committee's report was approved by the
Senate on March 8 and by the House on Wednesday, and Transportation
Secretary Rodney Slater said President Clinton would sign it into
law.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new regulations:
</P>
<P>
   --The DOT will work with airlines to improve employee training
with respect to transport of animals.
</P>
<P>
   --Airlines will have to notify passengers about the conditions in
which animals travel.
</P>
<P>
   --Airlines will have to submit monthly reports to the DOT on
animals lost, injured or killed, and the DOT will publish the
information.
</P>
<P>
   The conference committee rejected a provision requiring airlines
to improve air flow and climate control in sections of airplanes
where animals are kept.
</P>
<P>
   Most major airlines now accept animals as baggage, sometimes for
a fee.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Airlines allows passengers to check properly caged
animals, the same way they check a suitcase. American Airlines
specifies that dogs, cats, household birds and potbellied pigs may
be checked as baggage. Southwest Airlines allows only animals
assisting disabled passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Diana Cronan, a spokeswoman for the Air Transport Association,
called the final package of rules ''reasonable'' but said some
airlines may choose simply to stop accepting animals as cargo.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's provided as an additional customer service for
passengers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The American Kennel Club had opposed the legislation on the same
grounds, fearing that fewer airlines would agree to transport pets
in the future.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Costs Push Wholesale Prices Up  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Huge increases in the price of gasoline and
home heating oil catapulted wholesale prices up by 1 percent in
February -- the biggest one-month surge in nearly a decade. The
worrisome jump in inflation didn't faze Wall Street, however, as
bargain hunters sent the Dow Jones industrial average soaring to
its biggest one-day point gain in history.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow rose 499.19 points, or 4.9 percent, to close at
10,630.60. On the heels of Wednesday's 320-point gain, the rally
helped the Dow gain back a stunning 42 percent of the losses
recorded since it peaked at 11,722.98 on Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's best-known indicator easily beat the record for
the sharpest one-day Dow point rise ever -- 380.53 -- which was set
Sept. 8, 1998. It was not near a record for the biggest daily
percentage gain, however. Nasdaq, which this week was swooning
sharply from record heights, rode the Dow's coattails to a sharp
gain. The index closed up 134.77 at 4,717.39, after being down as
much as 127 points early in the day.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger-than-expected spike in the Producer Price Index,
which measures inflation pressures before they reach consumers,
came after wholesale prices showed no change in January, the Labor
Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Inflation is heating up but the kettle is far from a boil,''
said economist Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors. ''Instead,
there are nagging signs that maybe the pleasant non-inflationary
world that we have been living in is just a bit less friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month's leap in wholesale prices, the worst showing on
inflation since a 1 percent rise in October 1990, justifies the
Federal Reserve boosting interest rates again by at least a quarter
of a percentage point at its meeting Tuesday, economists said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised rates four times since June to slow the
white-hot economy and keep inflation at bay, but economists said
those actions have had little impact.
</P>
<P>
   The jolt in February's wholesale prices came from a whopping 5.2
percent jump in energy costs, the largest gain in nearly 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am monitoring the impact that energy prices are having on
our economy,'' said Labor Secretary Alexis Herman. ''Today's
report, however, continues to show that inflationary pressure
remains limited to the energy sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the volatile energy and food categories, the ''core''
rate of inflation, having fallen 0.2 percent in January, rose 0.3
percent last month. Some Wall Street investors took comfort in the
modest gain because it was right on target with many analysts'
projections.
</P>
<P>
   The government said the increase in the core inflation rate
mostly stemmed from a hefty 6.3 percent rise in cigarette prices,
the biggest gain in five months. economists said. Excluding
cigarettes, the core would have shown no change.
</P>
<P>
   On the energy front, home heating oil prices soared 30.6 percent
in February, the largest rise since a record 37.7 percent increase
in August 1990, leading the jump in overall energy costs. Gasoline
prices rose 12.9 percent, their biggest gain since April.
</P>
<P>
   Surging gasoline prices could have the effect of slowing the
economy if it forces consumers to pull back on their spending,
which is the locomotive of the economy, some economists said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because consumers cannot easily cut back on gasoline
purchases, they are left with less money to spend on everything
else,'' said First Union economist Mark Vitner. ''That should
ultimately slow the economy and help contain inflation pressures,
making the Fed's job a little easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Food prices, meanwhile, went up by 0.4 percent in February as a
record 24.6 percent rise in egg prices dwarfed falling prices for
chickens, turkeys and fresh vegetables. The previous record jump of
22.1 percent was recorded in October 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Higher gasoline and diesel bills boosted costs to transport eggs
from farms to grocery stores and may explain the big increase in
February's egg prices, said economist Mark Zandi of RFA Dismal
Sciences. Chicken prices, on the other hand, fell reflecting
slackened demand as beef consumption picked up, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Food prices could become a new problem,'' said Paul Kasriel,
chief economist for the Northern Trust Co. ''If we have a drought
this year, as some predict, and increased demand from recovering
Asian economies, food prices may be pushed higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the report, car prices fell 1.2 percent, the
biggest drop since July 1997, and truck prices declined 0.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The government will report on prices pressures at the consumer
level Friday and many analysts are estimating a February rise of
0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In other reports:
</P>
<P>
   -- The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment
benefits last week fell by 19,000 to 262,000, the lowest level
since Dec. 1, 1973, suggesting employers are scrambling to find
workers.
</P>
<P>
   -- Housing construction rose 1.3 percent in February to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.78 million units, additional
evidence the economy continues to power ahead.

<HEADLINE> Gays To Protest St. Patrick's Parade  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Irish gays and lesbians predicted thousands
would join them in a civil disobedience march down Fifth Avenue
before the official St. Patrick's Day parade.
</P>
<P>
   This year marks the 10th time that the New York-based Irish
Lesbian and Gay Organization has been banned from making the march
up Fifth Avenue under its own banner.
</P>
<P>
   The group planned the protest march -- in the opposite direction
of the parade -- for about an hour before the official parade starts
Friday morning. Members said they expected thousands to join the
march.
</P>
<P>
   As has become traditional, some will then turn around and try to
join the actual parade. Those who fail to heed police warnings face
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm lesbian, queer, Irish,'' said Ailbhe Smyth, head of
women's studies at University College in Dublin. ''But I have to
say that in Ireland, we no longer have this kind of intolerance,
this kind of homophobia, this kind of discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   She and 52 other Irish gays and lesbians were welcomed by
Manhattan Borough President C. Virginia Fields on the eve of
America's oldest and biggest St. Patrick's Day parade.
</P>
<P>
   The 239th annual march will feature shamrocks and ''Kiss me, I'm
Irish'' buttons. Many of the protesters are expected to wear ''Kiss
me, I'm queer'' buttons -- as they did Thursday at the reception
with Fields.
</P>
<P>
   The Ancient Order of Hibernians, a fraternal Catholic group that
runs the official parade, has repeatedly maintained its right to
exclude ILGO. And in February, a Manhattan federal jury ruled that
the city had not violated the group's First Amendment rights by
denying it a marching permit.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani will be toward the front of the
parade.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he'll have a new political opponent following him.
U.S. Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton will walk up Fifth on
St. Patrick's for her first time -- against ILGO's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   One major figure may be missing this year: 80-year-old Cardinal
John O'Connor, whose health has been failing since he underwent
brain surgery in September. Church officials said he probably will
not greet marchers as he usually does.

<HEADLINE> Lockhart Decries GOP Letter on Guns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Continuing a week of tit-for-tat on gun
control, the White House said Thursday that a Republican
fund-raising letter mischaracterizes President Clinton's budget
request for enforcement of gun crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The letter says Clinton, ''bent on revenge'' for Republican
legislative successes, is ''pushing all sorts of new spending
programs, including $280 million for gun control!''
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association and many Republicans in Congress
accuse the Clinton administration of failing to enforce existing
gun control laws even as he seeks new gun control measures.
</P>
<P>
   The Feb. 29 letter from Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., asks for an
additional $20 contribution toward GOP Senate elections this year.
McConnell is chairman of the National Republican Senatorial
Committee, which raises money for GOP candidates for Senate.
</P>
<P>
   An angry White House spokesman Joe Lockhart waved the letter at
reporters and said it ''takes the cake'' for misrepresentation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mitch McConnell says the president wants to spend $280 million
on gun control, and if we only enforce the existing laws, we
wouldn't have a problem in this country,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, guess what, Senator McConnell, the $280 million is for
enforcement. The $280 million is for putting 1,000 new gun
prosecutors on the local level, 500 new ATF agents out in the
fields,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Roy, an NRSC spokesman, said the wording is not a
mischaracterization.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they claim they're going to use it to enforce existing law,
we're still left wondering what took you so long,'' Roy said.

<HEADLINE> Bill paying doctors, hospitals, for failed HMOs passes Assembly  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Legislation reimbursing hospitals and
doctors who were owed money after two managed care companies went
belly up is one step closer to becoming law.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial package to pay those who provided services for
the now-defunct HIP Healthcare of New Jersey and the American
Preferred Provider Plan would use $50 million in state funds and
$50 million from a new assessment on the state's surviving HMOs.
Doctors and hospitals have agreed to forgive $50 million of the
total $150 million debt.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, A-1890, passed the Assembly on Thursday by a 64-7 vote
with six abstentions. Attention now shifts to the Senate, which is
expected to act on the bill next week. Gov. Christie Whitman
supports it.
</P>
<P>
   Health insurance representatives call the plan a dangerous
precedent that forces surviving HMOs to bail out competitors by
paying their debts to healthcare providers. Representatives from
hospitals and doctors, however, maintain that they stepped in when
patients and the state needed help, and should be compensated.
</P>
<P>
   The managed care industry lobbied furiously against the bill.
The group has also waged a media campaign to have the bill changed.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the head of the New Jersey Association of Health
Plans said a lawsuit is likely.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no question. We've had serious discussions about
litigation, what form it would take and who the parties would be,''
said Paul Langevin.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ''we'll continue to try to make our case in the
Senate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Langevin said a provision in the bill that would prevent HMOs
from passing on their added costs to ratepayers is
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Lillo of the New Jersey Hospital Association said he was
pleased that the bill passed the Assembly in a largely bipartisan
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''This may not be the best compromise, but it's the fairest,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Jack Collins said the bill represents a
compromise that will not overburden taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's time to pay those people,'' he said of the
doctors and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   He agreed that the bill closes the door on a troubling incident
some believe merits more investigation.
</P>
<P>
   State regulators approved a deal in July 1997 to have HIP turn
over most of its assets to a for-profit company, PHP Healthcare
Corp., which agreed to provide care to HIP members. Within eight
months of the transaction, though, PHP stopped paying health care
providers, leaving HIP heavily in debt.

<HEADLINE> Report: Slaves Helped Build Capitol  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some workers who helped build the White House
and Capitol, two national landmarks of democracy and freedom,
weren't free at all. They were slaves, and a local television
station reported Thursday that it has obtained the pay slips to
prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Historians have known for years that local property owners
loaned slaves to help build the president's residence and the
meeting house of Congress, but details of their work have laid in
archives and libraries for generations.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, WRC-TV, an NBC-owned station in Washington,
reported that it had obtained actual pay statements found in
Treasury Department papers at the National Archives.
</P>
<P>
   The station reported that the two building projects employed 650
people over eight years, including 400 slaves and more than 50 free
blacks. The slaves earned $5 a month, which was given to
slaveowners, who hired them out, the station reported.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., says he'll introduce a resolution in
Congress later this month to recognize the contribution the slaves
made. ''It's time the role African Americans played be fully
realized and given the honorable recognition that they deserve,''
he said in a statement released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   By the spring of 1800, work on both the Capitol and the White
House was nearing completion. President John Adams moved into the
White House and Congress held its first session in the Capitol in
November of that year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The backbone of the labor force in Maryland and Virginia at
this time were black people, slaves -- mostly slaves,'' said William
Allen, an historian in the Office of the Architect of the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   In his history of the District of Columbia, author Keith Melder
writes that some of the free black men and skilled slaves who
worked on the Capitol and White House were subsequently laid off.
</P>
<P>
   ''Funds had run out,'' he wrote. ''The unstable employment
situation on federal construction was the cause of much hardship
among the workers and their families.''

<HEADLINE> Reuters Reaches Deal With Union  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Reuters, the financial news and information
provider, reached a tentative settlement Thursday with the union
representing its U.S. employees after two years of often tense
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very pleased,'' said company spokeswoman Nancy
Bobrowitz.
</P>
<P>
   Bobrowitz did not release details of the accord, which was still
being reviewed by union officials. A spokesman for the Newspaper
Guild of New York did not return a request for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The main points of contention in the drawn-out talks were
related to job security. The company was seeking greater
flexibility in handling layoffs and making staff assignments, but
the union had called the proposals unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   The talks have been going on for 2{ years, and the employees had
been working without a contract since early 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions had been rising in recent weeks and members of the
union, which represents 600 U.S.-based reporters and technicians,
authorized union leaders to declare a strike.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Reuters reporters went on a 12-day byline strike,
and in January all but 30 of the company's 120 journalists in New
York called in sick just as U.S. companies began reporting
first-quarter earnings. Management personnel were called upon to
help put out the report that day.

<HEADLINE> Benefits of Vt. Civil Union Bill  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   These are some of the key benefits that would be
conferred on
gay and lesbian couples under the civil union bill that passed the
Vermont House on Thursday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   -- Property. Partners would be entitled to joint title, transfer
from one to the other on death, and property transfer tax benefits.
</P>
<P>
   -- Lawsuits. Someone in a civil union would be able to sue for
the wrongful death of a partner, the emotional distress caused by a
partner's death or injury, and the loss of consortium caused by
death or injury.
</P>
<P>
   -- Probate. Probate law and procedures related to spouses would
flow to civil union partners.
</P>
<P>
   -- Adoption. Civil union partners would be entitled to all the
protections and benefits available when adopting a child. Same-sex
couples already are allowed under state law to adopt, but the laws
would reflect that those couples would be treated as spouses.
</P>
<P>
   -- Insurance. State employees in civil unions would be treated as
spouses for insurance or continuing care contracts.
</P>
<P>
   -- Abuse. Parties to a civil union would qualify for various
abuse programs as spouses.
</P>
<P>
   -- Discrimination. Laws prohibiting discrimination based on
marital status would apply to civil union couples.
</P>
<P>
   -- Compensation. Provisions in victims' compensation and workers'
compensation related to spouses also would apply to civil union
partners.
</P>
<P>
   -- Health care. Medical decisions that a spouse may make also can
be made by those in a civil union. Hospital visitation and
notification would be treated similarly.
</P>
<P>
   -- Testimony. As with spouses, partners in a civil union could
not be compelled to testify against one another.
</P>
<P>
   -- Definitions. State laws that confer benefits or rights to
people based on their marital or family status -- such as family
landowner rights to hunt and fish or definitions of family farmers
-- would be broadened to recognize civil unions.

<HEADLINE> Traveling Pet Protections Approved  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New rules will require U.S. airlines to
compile and release information on traveling pets that are killed
or injured.
</P>
<P>
   The requirements are part of an aviation bill approved by the
Senate on March 8 and by the House on Wednesday. Transportation
Secretary Rodney Slater said President Clinton will sign it into
law.
</P>
<P>
   The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
hailed ''a stunning win for animals that must travel by air.'' But
the airline industry warned some airlines may choose to stop
accepting animals.
</P>
<P>
   Congress took on the issue in response to reports of pets hurt
or killed by rough handling on the ground, or by temperature
extremes and oxygen depletion in the air. Under the new rules,
domestic airlines will have to begin reporting animal losses,
injuries or deaths to the federal Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Transport Association says that ''more than 99 percent
of the estimated 500,000 dogs and cats that airlines handle each
year'' reach their destination without incident. Critics say that
means up to 5,000 pets are hurt, killed or lost each year; the
industry says the 1 percent or less includes cases of pets turned
away due to inadequate cages or veterinary papers.
</P>
<P>
   The agriculture department reported in 1998 that, in the
previous five years, it had documented 2,516 instances of dogs and
cats ''severely affected'' by extreme temperatures, with 108 dogs
and cats dying as a result.
</P>
<P>
   In one 1997 case, Donna and Stephen Calk of Denver, Colo., went
to baggage claim after a flight from New Jersey to Los Angeles and
found their golden retriever, Jed, not breathing and covered in
urine, feces, and vomit. An autopsy revealed the dog had died of
suffocation due to lack of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., used the Calks' ''horror story''
to push for passage of the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new law:
</P>
<P>
   --The DOT will work with airlines to improve employee training
with respect to transport of animals.
</P>
<P>
   --Airlines will have to notify passengers about the conditions in
which animals travel.
</P>
<P>
   --Airlines will have to submit monthly reports to the DOT on
animals lost, injured or killed, and the DOT will publish the
information.
</P>
<P>
   Most major airlines now accept animals as baggage, sometimes for
a fee.
</P>
<P>
   Diana Cronan, a spokeswoman for the Air Transport Association,
called the final package of rules ''reasonable'' but said some
airlines may choose simply to stop accepting animals as cargo.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's provided as an additional customer service for
passengers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The American Kennel Club had opposed the legislation on the same
grounds, fearing that fewer airlines would agree to transport pets
in the future.

<HEADLINE> Rover Sale May Not Mean Layoffs  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE STANLEY, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Business owners in Britain's industrial heartland
gave a cautious thumbs-up Thursday to a deal that would keep the
country's largest car factory operating into the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders, however, accused German automaker BMW of
betraying British workers by selling the Rover Group's passenger
car business to a venture capital firm that has no manufacturing
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Panic spread across central England's West Midlands region this
week when BMW suggested it might sell Rover. Many feared the
possible closure of Rover's Longbridge factory in Birmingham,
predicting the loss of 8,500 jobs there and at least 17,000 jobs at
nearby firms that supply it.
</P>
<P>
   BMW, which bought Rover in 1994 from British Aerospace and Honda
of Japan, has been struggling ever since to make a profit on the
high-volume car models it produces at the flagship plant.
</P>
<P>
   Unable any longer to justify the chronic expense, the Germans
decided to sell it to Alchemy Partners Ltd., a London-based
investment firm. BMW also plans to sell its profitable Land Rover
sport utility vehicle unit to Ford Motor Co., a source said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Alchemy gave assurances Thursday that it aims to keep producing
Rover cars, including the sporty MG, under the new name of MG Car
Co.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is expected that the MG Car Co. will employ a significant
workforce and will rapidly develop into a self-standing, highly
viable British car manufacturer,'' Alchemy said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   While such plans could always change, the immediate outcome of
the sale could have been far worse for Rover's workers and for the
thousands of smaller companies in central England that depend on it
for their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   The Birmingham Chamber of Commerce said it still had doubts
about the long-term future for Longbridge.
</P>
<P>
   ''The situation is deeply unsettling for the work force,'' the
chamber said in a statement. ''However, we know that Alchemy has a
tremendous record in industrial relations and are capable of making
a serious effort to save the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Woodley, chief negotiator for the Transport and General
Workers Union, fulminated that BMW had broken a pledge to modernize
the century-old Longbridge plant.
</P>
<P>
   ''It should have fulfilled its obligations, and it should have
treated Britain and British workers the same way it would have
treated its own people, fairly, honestly and evenhandedly,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Alchemy is a company with no track record as an
automaker.
</P>
<P>
   Neither BMW nor Alchemy would put a value on the sale. BMW was
expected to announce details on Friday, along with its plans to
sell Land Rover to Ford.
</P>
<P>
   But industry analysts said that BMW has done well for itself by
unloading its money-losing Rover car business.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Collins of Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette added that
Alchemy, by calling its new venture the MG Car Co., appeared to be
trying to distance itself from the Rover name.
</P>
<P>
   ''The brand equity in that name is really about zero, I would
say,'' Collins said.

<HEADLINE> Chavez Registers His Candidacy  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Thousands of Venezuelans converged on
a downtown Caracas street Thursday to cheer on President Hugo
Chavez, who registered his candidacy for re-election promising to
finish the revolution he started.
</P>
<P>
   The people shouted ''Chavez! Chavez!'' as the president entered
the National Electoral Council to submit his name for the May 28
presidential balloting that is required by a new constitution
pushed through by Chavez as part of his ''social revolution'' for
Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   ''The revolution goes forward,'' Chavez declared after
registering his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing his trademark red paratrooper's beret, Chavez later
addressed thousands of supporters gathered in a downtown Caracas
plaza and vowed to deliver a ''thundering knockout to the
counterrevolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela's new constitution requires most public powers,
including the presidency, Congress, governorships and local
councils, to be ''religitimized'' through new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela's volatile political situation took an unexpected turn
last week when a former army officer who helped Chavez stage his
failed 1992 coup attempt announced he would challenge Chavez for
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the former officer, Francisco Arias, told
international reporters in Caracas that he wants to restore
confidence in an economy battered by the Venezuelan leader's
''aggressive discourse.''
</P>
<P>
   Arias, who resigned this week as governor of the oil-rich state
of Zulia to run for president, said he wants to move away from
Chavez's ''statist and centralist'' policies, promote private
investment and stop pitting ''rich against poor.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been led into unnecessary confrontation, toward
anarchy,'' Arias, told international reporters at a breakfast
meeting in Caracas.
</P>
<P>
   Arias is one of three former army officers who helped Chavez
carry out a failed 1992 coup against then-President Carlos Andres
Perez. All three broke away from the president in recent weeks,
saying he is betraying the original goals of their rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Despite rising crime and unemployment and an economy that shrank
last year by seven percent, Chavez remains widely popular among
Venezuela's poor majority. Until Arias announced his candidacy last
week, Chavez faced little viable political opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Because Arias is not seen to be part of the country's
discredited political class that Chavez's leftist coalition has
decimated, many believe he has a chance to unseat the president in
May 28 balloting.

<HEADLINE> McCain Team Calls Bush Disrespectful  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John McCain's supporters are accusing George
W. Bush of showing little respect for the senator and his political
reform agenda, saying ''macho talk'' has killed hopes for an early
endorsement that could be vital to Bush's prospects in November.
</P>
<P>
   The Texan and his advisers scrambled Thursday to explain the
remarks he made in an interview with The New York Times, fearing
the fallout could further alienate McCain and his
independent-minded supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that the Arizona senator helped produce record turnouts
in the Republican presidential primaries, Bush told the newspaper,
''Well, then, how come he didn't win?'' Asked whether McCain had
raised his consciousness about reform, the Texas governor replied,
''No, he didn't change my views.'' He said he had no intentions of
making concessions to McCain on campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to make amends Thursday, Bush said in Illinois, ''I
appreciate the hard campaign that John McCain waged. He ran a good
race. He highlighted the need for reform, and I appreciate the
ideas that he brought forth in the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign manager, Joe Allbaugh, called McCain's top
political adviser, John Weaver, to say he regretted that the
newspaper story didn't include more of the nice things Bush said
about McCain. In addition, through Sen. Paul Coverdell of Georgia,
he sought to reassure McCain's allies in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   According to officials in both campaigns, Allbaugh also promised
that Bush would go out of his way to speak well of McCain to
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after that telephone call, Bush said at a news
conference that the story ''didn't characterize how I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he won't embrace McCain's plan to ban unlimited,
unregulated ''soft money,'' but he argues that there is common
ground on other reform measures.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course, he and I agree on a lot, and it starts with this:
The best reform for America is to end the Clinton-Gore era in
Washington, D.C.,'' the governor said in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, however, has said Bush can't unite the party simply over
a shared dislike of Democrat Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Times, Lisa Carparelli, said the newspaper
published the entire text of its interview with Bush on the
newspaper's Web site. ''Our article correctly captured both the
news and the tone of our interview with Governor Bush,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Reading past more conciliatory language in the newspaper
interview, McCain's advisers said they were stunned that Bush would
strike a dismissive chord while his aides were privately courting
McCain's endorsement. Independent and swing voters, such as those
who flocked to McCain in some GOP primaries, could determine the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ''Senator McCain looks forward to bringing the party together by
campaigning across the country for reform-minded Republicans, and
we're a little disappointed by the tone of the Bush campaign,''
spokesman Todd Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris announced the formation of a political action committee
that will pay McCain's expenses as he barnstorms the country this
year on behalf of GOP candidates and his own initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   A senior McCain adviser said a quick resolution to the feud,
which was never likely, is now out of the question. He put the odds
of McCain endorsing before the election at ''no better than
50-50.''
</P>
<P>
   Another adviser said it was now probable that McCain would never
directly endorse Bush himself, though he could still back the
ticket late in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The senator was on vacation and unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's advisers have said their boss realizes that Bush can't
bow to his every demand because the GOP base would revolt. What he
wants from Bush is a sincere pledge to make progress on political
reforms and a show of respect.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to mend fences, Bush advisers called McCain
intermediaries to point out that the Texan had also praised his
former rival in the Times story. They faxed dozens of copies of a
Dallas Morning News interview that appeared more conciliatory.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists in both camps said Bush handled the situation
awkwardly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just don't know what Bush was thinking,'' said Rep. Peter
King, R-N.Y., who switched allegiance from Bush to McCain last
month. ''He won the nomination, fine, but to win the White House he
has to reach out to McCain and his voters, and he's not going to do
that with macho talk about no concessions.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior Bush advisers have been torn between the need to court
McCain and the fear that any negotiations would make them appear
weak. Bush has told his advisers he won't turn over the convention
or the party platform to a vanquished rival, according to several
aides.
</P>
<P>
   Those same aides complain that McCain's staff has not made the
peacekeeping any easier by forming a PAC, talking about a White
House bid in 2004 and refusing to rule out a third-party bid this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of who is at fault, all sides agree that peacekeeping
plans were set back.
</P>
<P>
   ''What all of us around both these guys are saying is you have
to be sensitive about what you say while we try to bring this
together,'' said Washington lobbyist Vin Weber, a McCain ally
trying to broker an agreement between the two rivals.

<HEADLINE> Attorney general's office raises alarm about open records bill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Efforts to rewrite the state's law on
public access to government records hit a bump Thursday as the
attorney general's office raised concerns about police records.
</P>
<P>
   First Assistant Attorney General Paul H. Zoubek told the Senate
Judiciary Committee the proposed legislation carries risks of
exposing sensitive investigative files.
</P>
<P>
   ''Access would have a chilling effect on the willingness of
witnesses to come forward to provide relevant and often critical
information,'' Zoubek said. He said, for instance, members of
organized crime groups could use records to identify confidential
informants.
</P>
<P>
   The existing Public Records Law mandates that any document
required under statute be maintained as a public record. But it
does not apply to vast banks of information at all levels of
government, from consulting reports to land appraisals to bill
receipts, for which there is no specific mention in any state law.
</P>
<P>
   The main bill under consideration now, S-866, expands the 1963
law to create a presumption that all government documents are to be
regarded as public records unless a specific law or executive order
from the governor says otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Jack Collins held his version of the bill to
give him time to evaluate Zoubek's concerns. It had been scheduled
for Assembly consideration Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Man Arrested in Florida Abduction  </HEADLINE>
By RON WORD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- An unemployed man suspected of
snatching a 10-year-old girl from her driveway and holding her for
three days was ordered held on $1 million bail under a suicide
watch Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   James P. Johnson, 38, said only, ''Good morning, your honor''
during a video court appearance on a charge of kidnapping of a
child for the purpose of committing sexual acts.
</P>
<P>
   He allegedly abducted Jessica Rodriguez on March 6 after she got
off a school bus. She was later released outside a Wal-Mart 25
miles from her home.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson checked himself into a mental health center earlier this
week, and was arrested there Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Thomas Kurrus asked Judge Yselta McDonald to
order his client held at the mental health facility and not in
jail. ''The family is very concerned about suicidal ideations,''
Kurrus said. He said Johnson suffers from recurrent depression.
</P>
<P>
   The judge denied the request but ordered jailers to keep Johnson
in a cell by himself under a 24-hour suicide watch.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a divorced father of three young girls who lived with
him, has no criminal record, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   His young daughters were told by their father not to go near a
room that was on the other side of a large house from where the
family spent most of its time, said Terry Thomas, an agent with the
Florida Department of Law Enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one for the books,'' said Thomas, who interviewed both
the victim and Johnson's children.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, one of the state's leading experts in crimes against
children, said Johnson's daughters were sent to stay with relatives
when their father checked into a private mental health hospital
earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Their mother has not had custody of the girls for several years,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who declined to answer some questions involving specific
evidence in the case, said Jessica was locked in a room akin to a
mother-in-law apartment, with its own bathroom. At times, she was
held in the metal shed in the backyard.
</P>
<P>
   He said Jessica's captor regularly fed her and gave her water,
but told her to be quiet and she complied out of fear.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Johnson children were well-cared for and described
the typical lives of suburban children. They had plenty of games
and videos and their father took them out for pizza.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of kidnapping, Johnson could face life in prison
without parole. Police have also charged Johnson with sexual
battery on a person under 11. Prosecutor Rod Smith said he had not
yet decided whether he will prosecute that charge.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica is in good condition and has been returned to her family
near Trenton. Their house is about 30 miles from Johnson's home in
Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators searched his home and seized his green Jeep
Cherokee, which they said matches the description of the vehicle
used in the kidnapping. Jessica picked him out of a photo lineup,
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, The Associated Press does not identify victims or
alleged victims of sexual assault. In this case, however, the name
of the girl had been widely used because of the circumstances of
her abduction.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson may have attempted another abduction on March 1,
sheriff's spokeswoman Linda White said. A 9-year-old girl who lives
east of Gainesville described a man in a green Jeep Cherokee who
told her he was looking for a lost dog. The girl ran away as
another car approached, White said.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica's aunt, Nancy Nobles, said relatives didn't ask the girl
for details of her captivity during the week she has been back
home.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody even wanted to go there,'' she said. ''It was bad
enough that she had to answer questions from the police.''

<HEADLINE> Britain Speeds Aid to Flood Victims  </HEADLINE>
By CRAIG NELSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- With heavy rains forecast and
Mozambique's main highways still impassable, the British navy
anchored a floating helipad at the mouth of the swollen Save River
on Thursday to speed food aid to flood victims.
</P>
<P>
   From deck of the ship Ft. George, five British helicopters will
deliver food to 45,000 hungry flood victims near the central town
of Machanga, said Lindsey Davies, a spokeswoman for the World Food
Program, a U.N. agency.
</P>
<P>
   With heavy rains forecast in central and northern Mozambique
during the next five days, international aid agencies were
scrambling for different ways to rush food to flood survivors, but
their reliance on aircraft had not diminished.
</P>
<P>
   ''The unpredictable weather that's hampering our road access
will continue to make helicopters a vital source of aid for those
who need it,'' Davies said. She said there were renewed fears of
flooding because the Zambezi and Buzi rivers in central Mozambique
were reaching a ''critical level.''
</P>
<P>
   Monthlong flooding in central and southern Mozambique has killed
at least 492 people, left 330,000 homeless and caused an estimated
$250 million in damage to roads, bridges, railways and buildings.
</P>
<P>
   After a ruinous civil war that ended in 1992, Mozambique's
economy had been recovering when the floods struck. Its growth
rate, roughly 10 percent a year, is expected to fall this year
because of the disaster. The country remains one of the poorest in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a huge reconstruction bill, Mozambique's government
expressed disappointment Thursday that some creditor nations agreed
to suspend -- but not cancel -- its foreign debts, which it said
stand at $1.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Paris Club of Western creditors had announced a day earlier
that because of the extensive flooding, Mozambique would not have
to make debt payments of tens of millions of dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are satisfied that a positive step was taken for
Mozambique's debt -- but it falls short of our expectation,''
Foreign Minister Leonardo Simao said. ''Our expectation was for the
full cancelation of the debt.''
</P>
<P>
   The government will continue to ask that its debts be written
off, Simao said.

<HEADLINE> Tornado Hits Texas Near Austin  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEANDER, Texas (AP) -- A tornado hit northwest of Austin Thursday
afternoon, tearing roofs and breaking windows at about a dozen
homes.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported, said Leander police Sgt. Greg Minton.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of this town of 6,000 people, about 22 miles northwest
of Austin, milled in the streets afterward, hugging each other and
taking pictures of the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Shingles scattered front yards and patio furniture and jungle
gyms were strewn about.
</P>
<P>
   A fence post punctured the back wall of Larry Gregory's house,
entering a closet. Gregory said no one was home at the time, but
the closet was his family's tornado shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ''We never planned it like that, though,'' he said. ''It's
pretty chilling.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Officer Charged in Kidnappings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- A retired army general was
arrested Thursday in connection with the kidnapping of children
born in captivity during Argentina's ''dirty war.''
</P>
<P>
   Juan Sasiain was arrested as part of an investigation into
whether members of the armed forces kidnapped babies born to
leftist inmates held in clandestine detention centers during the
1976-1983 military dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights group charge the military organized a systematic
plan for the illegal adoption of more than 200 children born to
dissidents held captive during the military's seven-year campaign
against leftists and political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   As least 10 former officers have been arrested in the course of
the investigation. Among them are Jorge Videla, the regime's first
president, and retired Adm. Emilior Massera. Both were leaders of
the military junta that overthrew President Isabel Peron in 1976
and ruled until 1983.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest arrest, authorities charged Sasiain with child
kidnapping and detained him in a military barracks. During the
military rule, Sasiain reportedly was in charge of several
detention centers housing pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Sasiain, 73, immediately asked that he be placed
under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The children's mothers were among at least 9,000 Argentines who
vanished during the ''dirty war''; human rights groups say the
figure is closer to 30,000.

<HEADLINE> Highway rebuilding to shut down key ramp  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- Thousands of visitors to the city will
be going from the Bridgeport Bluefish to a tour of Bridgeport
blight because of a rebuilding project involving Interstate 95.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a more than $100 million project to rebuild I-95
through the city, the only southbound, downtown on-ramp to the
highway will be closed for at least 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   That means downtown traffic headed south onto I-95 will have to
be detoured onto Railroad Avenue which travels behind a series of
run-down, little used former factories and buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are concerned,'' Mickey Herbert, principal owner of the
Bridgeport Bluefish, said Wednesday. The baseball team attracted
more than 350,000 fans to downtown Bridgeport last season.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, we just don't know what this will do. A lot of fans
come from south of us, so they use that ramp'' to head home via
I-95, Herbert said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Rolfe, a roadway designer with the state Department of
Transportation, said there is no way to rebuild the ramp without
shutting it down.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot safely maintain traffic and reconstruct the ramp,''
Rolfe said. ''We will have to close it for about 14 months.''
</P>
<P>
   Rolfe said Railroad Avenue will be resurfaced while the downtown
on-ramp is closed.
</P>
<P>
   There are some concerns that traffic tie-ups, and the foreboding
character of blighted areas along Railroad Avenue, could discourage
customers and baseball fans from visiting downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Garland, a spokesman for the University of Bridgeport, said
many students come from towns south of Bridgeport, so the closed
ramp also will affect them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are concerned about access,'' Garland said. ''Many come at
night.''
</P>
<P>
   However, others say that the project is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to cause discomfort, but the end result will be
good,'' said Paul Timpanelli, president of the Bridgeport Regional
Business Council. ''Still, people will get frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   The Myrtle Avenue ramp will close later this month or early in
April.

<HEADLINE> Unarmed Man Shot by Police in N.Y.  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- An unarmed man was shot dead early Thursday by
an undercover detective during a fight on a busy Manhattan street,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Dorismond, a security guard, was shot by Detective
Anthony Vasquez as the officer and two others attempted a
''buy-and-bust'' drug operation near Penn Station and Madison
Square Garden, Police Commissioner Howard Safir said at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   One of the officers, who are all Hispanic, approached Dorismond,
who was black, and another man in front of a bar, Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He engaged them in a conversation relative to drugs,'' Safir
said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who also attended the news conference,
said Vasquez, 29, then came to the aid of the officer and his gun
discharged.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond, 25, was hit in the chest died at a hospital. No drugs
or other contraband were found on his body.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said police were still investigating how the gun went off.
Police could not confirm witness reports that Vasquez was hitting
Dorismond with his service revolver when it went off.
</P>
<P>
   The Dorismond shooting comes just two weeks after another
undercover officer fatally shot an unarmed man in the Bronx near
where unarmed immigrant Amadou Diallo was shot and killed last year
by four white police officers.
</P>
<P>
   The officers in the Diallo case were acquitted, sparking outrage
among residents.

<HEADLINE> Psychologists fired, corrections chief admits errors led torapist's release  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Two psychologists hired by the state to
review inmate records were dismissed Thursday because of their
roles in the release of a convicted rapist who is the target of a
nationwide manhunt.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Corrections Commissioner Jack Terhune acknowledged
that state corrections employees violated numerous procedures
before releasing Raymond Alves, 57, from the Southern State
Correctional Center in Cumberland County on March 9.
</P>
<P>
   Alves, who is being investigated in connection with several
unsolved murders, remained at large Thursday. The television
program ''America's Most Wanted'' will feature a bulletin on Alves
on Saturday night, Bergen County Prosecutor William Schmidt said.
Two investigators will be in Washington when the program airs to
receive any tips, the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Corrections and the state Attorney General's
office are investigating why Alves was released before law
enforcement authorities were notified.
</P>
<P>
   Corrections officials have acknowledged that they notified the
Bergen County Prosecutor's office of Alves' release too late for
prosecutors to be able to object.
</P>
<P>
   Terhune said letters sent by the Bergen County prosecutor's
office to the state Parole Board offering evidence that Alves is a
suspect in several murders and claims that he raped and killed more
than a dozen women might not even have been considered by
corrections officials before his release.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Alves, who as a convicted sex offender must notify
authorities of his address upon release from prison, gave
corrections officials a bogus address.
</P>
<P>
   ''Specifically and regrettably, there were a whole host of
procedures that were not followed,'' Terhune said. ''The policy and
procedure was there. It just wasn't followed.''
</P>
<P>
   Terhune admitted the errors before a state Senate committee
whose members demanded to know exactly how the convict was released
and who authorized it.
</P>
<P>
   Terhune offered no names or details at the hearing, only a
vigorous apology and the promise that in the future, no sex
offender would be released until a prison administrator personally
reviews the convict's entire record.
</P>
<P>
   Terhune released the names of the private psychologists -- Dr.
Judith Frankel and Dr. Jack Gibbons -- only after senators told him
they wanted the names of those involved and threatened to hire a
special counsel and fight to have the records opened if he did not
comply.
</P>
<P>
   Alves served less than half of a 47-year sentence for the 1976
rape of a teen in Fair Lawn and the assault of a Clifton teen.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Alves was again imprisoned in New Jersey for violating
his parole after an arrest in Flagstaff, Ariz., on charges of
possession of a handgun, Terhune said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The corrections department must begin reviewing a prisoner's
records 150 days before the scheduled release and must notify the
county prosecutor between 90 and 30 days in advance, Terhune said.
The corrections department began Alves' review on Jan. 11 and he
was released March 9.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did something wrong. We had procedures in place and our
very own procedures were not followed,'' Terhune said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman William L. Gormley,
R-Atlantic, said he wants to know how Alves was released.
</P>
<P>
   ''The question is not what happened,'' Gormley said. ''The whole
state wants to know how this happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Raymond J. Zane, D-Gloucester, wants to know what files the
private psychologists reviewed and said any information about
additional victims should have been considered.
</P>
<P>
   But Terhune repeatedly said he did not know what documents were
reviewed by the officials who approved the release.
</P>
<P>
   The corrections department could fine, suspend or dismiss any
other state employee involved. State employees and the
psychologists could be subject to criminal action, Terhune said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman supports Terhune and applauded his move to
admit the error and take action, said her spokesman, Pete
McDonough.
</P>
<P>
   ''The commissioner did the right thing today, going to the
committee and admitting there had been some mistakes in his
department,'' McDonough said.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt also said Thursday that the New York City police
department has joined his office and other agencies in the hunt for
Alves.

<HEADLINE> Irish Premier Lauds Poet Heaney  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern invoked the
verses of Irish poet Seamus Heaney on St. Patrick's eve to give a
hopeful view of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Ahern appeared at the Kennedy Center with Peter Mandelson, the
British minister for Northern Ireland. They listened as actress
Roma Downey of TV's ''Touched by an Angel'' read from a Heaney
poem:
</P>
<P>
   ''The longed for tidal wave of Justice
</P>
<P>
   ''Can rise up and
</P>
<P>
   ''Hope and History rhyme.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Ahern read from prepared remarks: ''We who live in Ireland
do so at a time when hope and history do indeed rhyme in many
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahern and Mandelson were speaking at a free performance to
promote a festival at the Kennedy Center called ''Island -- Arts
from Ireland,'' devoted to Irish music, plays, films, dance and
poetry. Heaney, who will appear at the festival in May, has
recently created an unusual best-seller in Britain with his poetic
translation of the old English tale ''Beowulf.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson also joined politics and art optimistically with
praise for the festival.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it will help give a tantalizing view of what Northern
Ireland could be like and I believe will be like,'' he said, after
promising not to give a political speech.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a very big prize to be gained in Northern Ireland.
It's a prize of permanent peace, political inclusion for everyone
... and where there are aren't any second-class citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahern and Mandelson were in Washington, along with Sinn Fein
leader Gerry Adams and Protestant politician David Trimble, for
talks with President Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Fortier Denied Bond During Appeal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- An appeals court has denied a bid by Michael
Fortier to be set free on bond pending an appeal of his 12-year
prison sentence for failing to notify authorities of the Oklahoma
City bombing plot.
</P>
<P>
   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday denied
Fortier's motion for bail saying the defendant had not raised a
substantial question of law or fact likely to result in a prison
sentence less than the time served by the expected conclusion of
the appeal process.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Fortier's lawyers filed an appeal arguing his
sentence is the result of a vindictive judge who erred by giving
Fortier a punishment well above federal guidelines for involuntary
manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge G. Thomas Van Bebber sentenced Fortier to 12
years in prison and fined him $200,000 in May 1998, but the federal
appeals court in Denver sent the case back to Van Bebber because he
mistakenly used guidelines for first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   Van Bebber last October reduced the fine to $75,000 but handed
down an identical 12-year sentence using ''an upward departure''
that allowed him to sentence Fortier above the standard sentence of
4 years and 3 months for involuntary manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Fortier pleaded guilty to failing to notify authorities about a
plot to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah federal building. He also was
sentenced for helping to move and sell stolen weapons and lying to
FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy McVeigh, a friend of Fortier''s, was convicted on
federal murder charges and sentenced to death in the April 19,
1995, bombing that killed 168 people and injured hundreds more.
Terry Nichols was sentenced to life in prison without parole after
being convicted of conspiracy and involuntary manslaughter.

<HEADLINE> Northwest takes lead in new fare increase after spoiling last one  </HEADLINE>
By KARREN MILLS, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- After helping derail two recent attempts by
competitors to boost airline fares, Northwest Airlines on Thursday
announced a change of heart and raised round-trip fares throughout
its domestic system.
</P>
<P>
   But the Eagan-based carrier did things its own way.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest's biggest increase, $20 to $40 round-trip, is in
unrestricted fares. The fourth-largest carrier is limiting the
increase to $10 to $20 for round-trip excursion fares, the cheaper
rates paid by vacationers who plan in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest's U.S. alliance partner, Continental Airlines, led
failed attempts to boost fares on Feb. 18 and March 10. Continental
had posted increases of $10, $20 and $30 for excursion fares in
February. Three weeks later, Continental tried again, boosting its
excursion fares by $20, $30 and $40.
</P>
<P>
   Several airlines refused to follow Continental's lead in the
first attempt. Northwest and Southwest Airlines went against the
tide in the attempt last week.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest declined specific comment on its fare increases, which
also included varying hikes in unpublished senior, military,
Internet and consolidator fares.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest also raised its fees for excess luggage, transporting
pets, replacing lost tickets and other services by $5 to $25.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocate Terry Trippler, an airline expert with
1travel.com, agreed with the Northwest strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought Continental was going in the wrong direction,''
Trippler said. ''The Northwest increase makes a lot more sense.
It's more fair. I think this puppy's going to stick.''
</P>
<P>
   Other carriers did not immediately match the Northwest
increases, but Delta Air Lines and United Airlines were studying
them, spokesmen said. Fare increases generally are rescinded if
other major airlines do not follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've found all along that Northwest wants to increase fares
on their terms,'' Trippler said. ''Northwest did this on a
Thursday, giving everybody ample time to make a decision before
Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that Northwest took the extra step of announcing
its increases before they were loaded into computers used by agents
to book flights.

<HEADLINE> Suspected Robber Killed by Fla. Cops  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Police shot and killed a man
suspected of being a bank robber after a two-hour standoff Thursday
in an office building hallway as 50 workers hid behind locked
doors.
</P>
<P>
   The armed man, William McCarthy Pettit, was suspected of holding
up a NationsBank branch down the street. He fled into Cypress Creek
Business Park and was shot by police when he made a sudden and
suspicious move, police spokesman Mike Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was shot by SWAT team members in the hallway,'' Reed said.
''I don't know if he was threatening them.''
</P>
<P>
   No one else was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Pettit, 46, died at a hospital, Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   Pettit allegedly walked into the bank with a pistol, took an
undisclosed amount of cash and fled. As police looked for him on
foot and from a helicopter, someone from the nearby office building
called 911 to report a suspicious person.
</P>
<P>
   Pettit ran into a bathroom on the second floor. Police said they
didn't evacuate the building because the workers were safer inside.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bush Trade Barbs on Taxes  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHEVY CHASE, Md. (AP) -- Democrat Al Gore criticized his
presidential rival's tax-cut plan Thursday as ''economic snake
oil'' that even congressional Republicans can't love. He said it
would leave social services begging or return America to the era of
ballooning budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in Springfield, Ill., Texas Gov. George W. Bush took
the slam curtly. ''He wants to leave the money in Washington,''
said Bush, referring to the lack of broad tax relief in Gore's
agenda. ''He'll say anything to get elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore cast the campaign as a choice between policies that
underwrote the ''Clinton-Gore recovery'' and ones that gave America
the ''Bush-Quayle catastrophe,'' meaning the recession that hit
when Bush's father was president.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can somebody come before the American people with a
straight face and say let's get rid of what's working and go back
to what failed?'' Gore, the presumptive Democratic presidential
nominee, asked in a speech to the Amalgamated Transit Union.
</P>
<P>
   Gore repeatedly criticized Bush's proposed $483 billion,
five-year tax cut as a ''risky scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   Many times in two appearances, Gore invoked John McCain's
attacks on Bush during the now-settled contest for the Republican
nomination -- trying to show that it is he, not Bush, who
appreciates the public passion for campaign finance reform
unearthed by the Arizona senator.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also rattled off the criticisms that McCain had voiced
about Bush's tax plan -- that it reserves too much for the rich and
puts nothing extra aside for Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am telling you, he should have been taking notes during John
McCain's campaign,'' Gore told an organization of neighborhood
groups, ACORN, in accepting its endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is so committed to this economic snake oil that ... he even
dismissed John McCain's campaign and said that he had learned
nothing from it and had no intention of taking any advice from the
McCain group.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's four-stop Illinois visit marked his return to the
fund-raising circuit for the first time since mid-December. He
headlined a $1,000-per-person event at the Cantigny War Museum in
Wheaton, aimed at grossing $100,000, and criticized the
administration's military policies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since we were having the meeting in a war museum, I felt like
holding a news conference in from of one of those old World War I
tanks and saying, 'Look what Clinton-Gore brought you,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's record-shattering $73 million campaign fund has
been largely depleted by McCain's challenge. His team plans to
raise up to $10 million in the next two months.
</P>
<P>
   Gore staged a rare day of campaigning inside the Washington
beltway before taking a few days off. And it was inside the beltway
that he found his latest fodder for attacking Bush -- a decision by
congressional Republicans a day earlier not to move ahead with a
budget plan similar to Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now, if it is so risky that even the group that Newt Gingrich
ushered into the United States Congress will not vote for it, you
know it is risky indeed,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says his tax cuts would not touch portions of projected
budget surpluses set aside for Social Security and Medicare and
would leave money to pay down the national debt. His plan would cut
tax rates for all income groups, bringing the lowest rate down to
10 percent from 15 percent now.
</P>
<P>
   Gore asserted Bush's plan leaves three choices: a massive raid
on Social Security, renewed deficit spending or an evisceration of
federal spending on health, education and other necessities. The
proper choice, he said, is ''None of the above.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He could put us way into the hole,'' Gore said. ''Back to the
Bush-Quayle years.''
</P>
<P>
   In an address to the Consumer Federation of America, Gore
endorsed efforts to stop pharmaceutical companies from winning
extended patent protections for genetic products.
</P>
<P>
   He tied the issue to his post-McCain emphasis on campaign
finance reform, saying the drive by companies for longer patent
protection shows how special interests can use their fund-raising
powers and political clout to get their way.
</P>
<P>
   In the speech, Gore also pitched enhanced protections for
patients in health maintenance organizations and criticized
congressional Republicans for holding up gun control.

<HEADLINE> Report: Militants Kill 11 in Algeria  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- Militants shot or stabbed to death seven
children and four adults in western Algeria at the end of a Muslim
holiday, the official APS news agency said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The attack Wednesday evening in Hatatba, 30 miles west of the
capital Algiers, came at the end of Aid El Kebir, a three-day
religious holiday that occurs 40 days after the end of Ramadan. It
commemorates the biblical story where Abraham is asked by God to
kill his son.
</P>
<P>
   President Abdelaziz Bouteflika has tried to restore peace to the
north African nation, but some Islamic militants have rejected a
government-backed partial amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   A militant insurgency began in 1992 after the army canceled
legislative elections that an Islamic party was poised to win. More
than 100,000 people have since died in the violence.

<HEADLINE> Ducruet Says He Was Set Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NICE, France (AP) -- Daniel Ducruet, divorced by Monaco's
Princess Stephanie after the publication of photographs showing him
frolicking with a Belgian stripper, told a French court Thursday
that he had been set up.
</P>
<P>
   Ducruet said he might even have been drugged when photographs
showing him in a poolside romp with Fili Houteman, the
then-reigning Miss Nude Belgium, were taken in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Houteman told the court that she was not aware of any plot and
had simply ''succumbed'' to Ducruet's advances.
</P>
<P>
   Ducruet charged that he was the victim of a sting operation and
prosecutors are seeking a one-year suspended prison sentence for
Houteman and six months in prison for photographer Stephane de
Lisiecki and alleged accomplice Yves Hoogewis, as well as $22,000.
</P>
<P>
   De Lisiecki said he had rented a villa in the southeastern
France and reserved plane tickets for Houteman. But he said he only
hoped for a photograph of a kiss.
</P>
<P>
   The court was due to give its verdict Apr. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie was granted a speedy divorce in October 1996, weeks
after two Italian magazines printed 40 pages of explicit photos
between Ducruet and Houteman.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal rocked Monaco. Stephanie and Ducruet had two
children.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker Pleads in Hit-and-Run  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- A state lawmaker pleaded innocent
Thursday in a hit-and-run that left a pedestrian dead.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Thomas W. Druce was given a trial date of May 8.	   Druce, 38, a House
member since 1993, is charged with vehicular
homicide, leaving the scene of a fatal accident, insurance fraud,
tampering with evidence and several other counts.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican allegedly struck and killed Kenneth Cains, 42, of
Harrisburg as he crossed a street July 27. Druce allegedly took
steps to conceal the accident, failed to report it, had his
state-leased vehicle repaired and returned it to an auto dealership
the next week, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Druce has said he thought he struck a sign and did not know
anyone had been killed until January, when police began
investigating him.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Edward Marsico Jr. said he plans to seek a
one-year mandatory jail sentence on the charge of leaving the scene
of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters were barred from attending the arraignment.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve news organizations, including The Associated Press, wrote
a letter of protest to chief Judge Joseph H. Kleinfelter of Dauphin
County Common Pleas Court, saying the closure of the hearing was
unconstitutional.

   SEATTLE (AP) -- An Algerian man suspected of ties to an alleged

entered the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Abdel Hakim Tizegha, 29, is scheduled to be sentenced here June
2 by U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein, the U.S. attorney's

   Investigators believe he may have ties to men in Montreal and
New York who have connections with Ahmed Ressam. Ressam is the
Algerian man who was arrested in Port Angeles in December after
arriving from Canada with explosives and bomb-making components in
his rented car.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Says No Plans To Open Borders  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- The communist government denied Thursday that it
intended to open up its borders to allow a mass exodus of Cubans to
the United States to show its anger at U.S. immigration policies.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign media had speculated about such a move after the
Communist Party daily Granma in an editorial Tuesday slammed the
U.S. Cuban Adjustment Act, a 1966 law that allows Cubans who reach
U.S. soil to apply for U.S. residency.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba says the law violates 1994 and 1995 migration accords with
the United States aimed at encouraging orderly, legal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Under those accords, Cuba is required to act to prevent people
from leaving the island illegally. There were concerns it would
stop doing so and allow a flood of emigrants to head for U.S.
shores to protest the 1966 law.
</P>
<P>
   When the Cuban government briefly lowered its coastal borders
during the summer of 1994, more than 30,000 rafters crossed the
straits or were picked up by the U.S. Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   A repeat is not planned, the government said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't make sense to anyone that Cuba is moving in that
direction,'' Granma said in its editorial.
</P>
<P>
   ''To the contrary, it is thanks to a special effort by our
country in controlling its borders'' that more do not leave
illegally, Granma said.
</P>
<P>
   The paper acknowledged that many Cubans think opening the
island's borders would be an appropriate way to show anger at the
failure to return 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, whose father is
demanding his return to the island.
</P>
<P>
   Under the accords, most Cubans trying to reach U.S. shores but
picked up at sea by the U.S. Coast Guard are automatically
repatriated to Cuba. But, under the 1966 act, those who reach U.S.
soil are allowed to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba says the law encourages illegal and dangerous forms of
immigration by Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban exiles in Miami claim that those who hazard the crossing
are seeking freedom.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: No China Attack Plan Evidence  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen said U.S. military
intelligence officials do ''not see any evidence of preparation for
an attack, any imminent attack'' on Taiwan, though China has
threatened to invade.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we do see is a war of words,'' Cohen said at a news
conference Friday morning local time.
</P>
<P>
   He urged both sides to stop the ''verbal jousting'' and ''back
away from this confrontational pose.'' He said that if China
continued a military buildup that was threatening to Taiwan, ''that
will only serve to increase pressure'' in Congress to sell more
arms to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   At a delicate moment in U.S. relations with China and Taiwan,
Cohen is using visits to Japan and South Korea to express American
resolve to maintain stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling tensions four years ago, when China held exercises in
Taiwan Straits during election time, Cohen said this time Beijing
appears ''to be trying to effect the outcome of the election (on
Saturday) with a show of words'' rather than a show of force.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to Atsugi on Thursday, Cohen was asked by
reporters about Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's warning to Taiwan on
Wednesday not to vote for a pro-independence candidate in the
presidential election. Zhu asserted that China would invade before
allowing Taiwan to become independent.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, in the days leading up to Taiwan's last
presidential election, the Navy had two carriers in the vicinity of
the Taiwan Strait in response to Chinese military exercises in the
strait. Now it has none.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said China's threat to use military force against Taiwan
is an obstacle to settling the reunification issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have indicated to the Chinese, as we have to the Taiwanese,
that we expect their differences to be resolved peacefully, that
the threat of the use of force is counterproductive,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen restated the long-standing U.S. one-China policy
supporting Taiwan with defensive arms while opposing its
independence.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that Taiwan should not seek independence,'' Cohen
said. ''We do not support it, but we do not support the use of
force on the part of China, either. So the comments about the use
of force can only be seen as contrary to our policy.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Cohen gave a pep talk to U.S. sailors at a naval
base near Tokyo and met with top Japanese government officials to
reinforce the Clinton administration's pledge to keep a highly
visible military presence in Japan -- including the USS Kitty Hawk
carrier battle group based at Yokosuka.
</P>
<P>
   The message behind Cohen's visit to Tokyo and Seoul is that the
United States is determined to keep 100,000 troops permanently
based in the Asia-Pacific region as a deterrent to conflict.
</P>
<P>
   On a stop Thursday at Atsugi Naval Air Facility, Cohen saw rows
of idle F/A-18 fighters sitting in the rain -- evidence that as
China-Taiwan tensions grow more intense, the Pentagon is intent on
avoiding military provocations. Atsugi is home to the air wing
assigned to the Kitty Hawk, which is in port.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also used his visit to Atsugi to push for a solution to a
persistent irritant in U.S.-Japanese relations -- air pollution
around the base, where 3,000 U.S. servicemen and their families
live.
</P>
<P>
   Japan announced Thursday that it would expedite a solution, and
it pledged to provide temporary off-base housing to as many as
request it while steps are taken to reduce the level of toxic
emissions from the Shinkampo incinerator, a privately owned plant
that sits just outside Atsugi's gates.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Navy has complained about the pollution for more than
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Japan agrees that air pollution surrounding Atsugi is ''a
problem affecting the health'' of American as well as Japanese
residents in the area, said Tsutomu Kawara, chief of the Japan
Defense Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are most appreciative,'' Cohen said. ''This is something
that affects the health and welfare and well-being of not only
American citizens who are at Atsugi but also of Japanese
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and Kawara also discussed the status of negotiations on a
new five-year agreement under which the government pays part of the
cost of having 47,000 American troops on its soil. Japanese
officials have indicated they may want to reduce the $5 billion a
year that Tokyo pays under the current arrangement, which expires
in 2001.

<HEADLINE> Vt. House OKs Civil Unions for Gays  </HEADLINE>
By ROSS SNEYD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- The Vermont House approved legislation
Thursday that would create the closest thing to gay marriage
America has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   If the bill allowing gays to form ''civil unions'' becomes law,
the state will have gone further than any other in recognizing
same-sex couples.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 76-69 to forward the bill to the state Senate,
where it is expected to win approval by the end of next month. The
legislation has the support of Democratic Gov. Howard Dean.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen Republicans, 57 Democrats, four Progressives and one
independent voted in favor in the House.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of at least 150 people lined the galleries and balconies
of the House chamber as lawmakers cast their votes. Many wore their
feelings on their lapels -- pink stickers for supporters, white for
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights advocates beamed, wept and hugged each other and
supportive lawmakers. ''We did it!'' said Chuck Kletecka of
Waterbury.
</P>
<P>
   ''This certainly is groundbreaking,'' said Peg Byron of the
Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, a gay advocacy group. ''I
think it really sets a moral as well as a legislative example for
the rest of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay couples who form civil unions would be entitled to some 300
state benefits or privileges available to married couples, in such
areas as inheritance, property transfers, medical decisions,
insurance and taxes. Such couples could file a joint state income
tax return, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government still would not recognize such unions
with regard to such things as immigration rights, Social Security
and federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Congress and more than 30 states have passed laws denying
recognition to same-sex ''marriages'' performed in other states.
Nonetheless, some suggest those state laws might not apply to
same-sex ''civil unions'' performed in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Murray, a lawyer and advocate of gay marriage, said it's
an open question whether couples from another state might be able
to enter civil unions in Vermont and have them recognized in their
home state.
</P>
<P>
   ''It totally depends on what state laws say in that other state
and what courts would interpret in that other state,'' Murray said.
''Other states have structures called marriage that they already
recognize. They don't have structures called civil unions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vermont bill provides for unions that amount to marriage in
everything but name. Partners could apply for a license from town
clerks and have their civil union ''certified'' by a justice of the
peace, a judge or a member of the clergy.
</P>
<P>
   The burdens are equally onerous. Partners who want to split up
would have to go through ''dissolution'' proceedings in Family
Court, in the same way that married couples have to pursue a
divorce. They would also assume each other's debts like married
couples.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bill carries Vermont to the edge of recognizing gay
marriage, lawmakers still sought to preserve the term ''marriage''
for the union of a man and a woman, adopting an amendment making
that clear. That definition previously had existed only in the
bill's preamble and not in the text.
</P>
<P>
   ''This raises my comfort level,'' said Republican Rep. Bruce
Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   But the House also rejected an amendment that would have
prohibited Vermont from recognizing gay marriages performed
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The entire issue was forced on the Legislature because the state
Supreme Court ruled in December that same-sex couples are being
unconstitutionally denied the benefits of marriage. The high court
left it up to the Legislature to decide whether to allow gay
marriages or create some kind of domestic partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the bill said it far exceeded anything done by any
other state.
</P>
<P>
   ''Vermont is so far out on a limb by itself because there's
nothing close to it,'' said Vince McCarthy of Pat Robertson's
American Center for Law and Justice. ''Even a state as liberal as
Massachusetts doesn't recognize domestic partnerships.''
</P>
<P>
   California comes closest. It started a domestic partnership
registry Jan. 1. Those listed as domestic partners are entitled to
hospital visitation rights, and state and local government workers
registered as domestic partners can get health care coverage for
their partners.
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, civil union partners also would be permitted to make
medical decisions on one another's behalf; they would be
responsible for one another's remains when one died; and they would
be able to inherit each other's estates without having to pay hefty
estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the excitement among gay rights advocates, there was
disappointment that Vermont did not simply approve gay marriage
outright.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an important start,'' Byron said. ''Vermont's not even
able to walk the whole road yet. But this beginning is so
crucial.''

<HEADLINE> EU Rejects Italy Royalty Proposal  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL AMES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Italy's former royal dynasty suffered a
setback Thursday when the European Parliament voted down a demand
that Italy end the 54-year exile of the family's menfolk.
</P>
<P>
   Italian voters abolished the monarchy in a 1946 referendum. Two
years later the new republic's constitution barred King Umberto and
his male descendants from the country in punishment at the royal
families support for the Fascist regime of Benito Mussolini.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the European Union assembly, meeting in Strasbourg,
France, defeated by 256 votes to 173 a proposal that would have
condemned the exile as ''a cruel and unusual punishment with no
place in a modern Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Victor Emmanuel, the son of Umberto and scion of the House of
Savoy, denounced the vote but told reporters at his home in Geneva
his campaign to return to Italy would continue. Umberto, who ruled
for just 26 days, died in Switzerland in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to the motion was led by the Socialist faction in the
assembly, joined by the Greens, Liberals, Communists and even five
members from the center-right European People's Party.
</P>
<P>
   The European Parliament resolution would not have been binding
on the Italian government. But the resolution would have urged the
EU's executive Commission to take legal action against Italy at the
EU high court if action was not taken within 6 months to end the
Savoys' exile.
</P>
<P>
   A constitutional amendment that would allow the Savoys' back was
approved by the lower house of the Italian parliament in 1998, but
has since been snagged in a Senate committee.
</P>
<P>
   The vote Thursday was also a loss for the Habsburg family
dynasty, which once ruled Austria's vast central European empire.
They are not barred from entering Austria, but cannot run for
certain offices and are trying to reclaim property seized from the
family.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution would have obliged Italy and Austria to restore
to the ex-royals ''full civil rights, including the right to enter
freely.''

<HEADLINE> Husband of DuPont Heiress Sentenced  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT MACY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The husband of a DuPont family heiress was
sentenced Thursday to more than 16 years in prison for his role in
the contract killing of a former prostitute who became a family
nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   ''To this day, I don't know why I did what I did,'' Christopher
Moseley told U.S. District Judge Justin Quackenbush. ''But I do
know Patricia Margello is dead, and I'm responsible for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Moseley and three others were charged in the Aug. 2, 1998 death
of Margello in a seedy motel near the Las Vegas Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Margello, 45, was described in court testimony as a former
prostitute who had been involved in a drug-riddled relationship
with Dean MacGuigan, a great-great grandson of a DuPont Chemical
Co. founder.
</P>
<P>
   Moseley, MacGuigan's stepfather, dispatched the heir to Las
Vegas in July 1998 in a bid to end the relationship with Margello.
When the efforts failed, Moseley ordered her murder.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am a broken man,'' Moseley told Quackenbush before
sentencing. ''I have badly hurt the woman I love with all of my
life. I am a shame to my children.''
</P>
<P>
   Moseley, the husband of DuPont heiress Lisa Dean Moseley, was
arrested at his Delaware home a month after the murder.
</P>
<P>
   He later confessed to recruiting Diana Hironaga -- a 41-year-old
drug user, former prostitute and porn actress -- to watch over
MacGuigan, 42. Moseley instructed Hironaga to carry out ''step
five'' of the plan -- Margello's death.
</P>
<P>
   Moseley and Hironaga pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit
murder for hire, implicating Richard Murillo and Joseph Balignasa
as the killers.
</P>
<P>
   Murillo was convicted in November on murder-for-hire and
conspiracy charges, and was sentenced to two life terms on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Balignasa pleaded guilty in December to a charge of
second-degree murder and was sentenced on Thursday to more than 15
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Hironaga had been sentenced to almost 16 years.

<HEADLINE> Man Who Killed Va. Trooper Executed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JARRATT, Va. (AP) -- A man who gunned down a Virginia state
trooper was executed by injection Thursday over the objections of
the policeman's children.
</P>
<P>
   In a final statement, Lonnie Weeks Jr. said he was sorry ''for
everything I've done to the Cavazos family, my family, to everyone
around the world -- and I just thank the Cavazos family for what
they've tried to do for me. I love them.''
</P>
<P>
   He had been condemned for the 1993 slaying of Trooper Jose M.
Cavazos.
</P>
<P>
   His execution was opposed by the trooper's grown children, one
of whom spoke with Weeks a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks was scheduled to be executed last September. But with
about two hours remaining, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the
execution to hear Weeks' appeal, which argued that the Prince
William County jury that convicted Weeks was confused by the
sentencing instructions.
</P>
<P>
   The jury twice asked the judge for further instructions, and one
juror said after the verdict that she didn't know she could opt for
a lesser sentence.
</P>
<P>
   In a 5-4 decision in January, the justices ruled that the
instructions were clear and that Weeks could be executed.

Cuba Chides Elian's Fla. Family

<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- In a statement published today, the Cuban government said the

father from talking to him on the telephone in recent days. The nearly daily
accounting of Juan Miguel Gonzalez's attempts to communicate with his son was
published in the Communist Party daily Granma. It said the Miami relatives
typically argue with or hang up on the father, tell him the boy is not home or
is sleeping, distract the boy during his conversations with his father or simply
do not pick up the phone. Armando Gutierrez, a spokesman for the Miami
relatives, denied the Cuban account.

Ray Reports on FBI Files

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Robert Ray said today he found no
credible evidence that first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton or senior White House
officials were involved in seeking the FBI background files on Republicans. Ray
said his office was ending the investigation with no prosecutions. The White
House has said the gathering of files was a bureaucratic blunder based on
outdated Secret Service lists of White House entry passholders.

The Netherlands, Poland and Romania. Pentagon spokesman P.J. Crowley spoke a day

<HEADLINE> France PM Unveils Tax Cuts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- France's prime minister unveiled a package of tax
cuts and spending plans on Thursday, a program that could silence
criticism that the country's robust growth is not reaching all
sectors of society.
</P>
<P>
   Premier Lionel Jospin announced that a forecast $7.4 billion
windfall in tax revenues would be used to cut France's record tax
burden and boost public spending.
</P>
<P>
   His announcement on TF1 television came just hours after angry
teachers, parents and students paraded through the streets of the
country, in a nationwide protest billed as the biggest in five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The windfall belongs to all the French. It is the product of
their efforts and I think it is a positive ratification of an
economy policy that has been right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasts for the tax windfall are based on an upward revision
of the government's growth target for 2000. In the original budget
for this year, the official forecast was 2.8 percent growth but it
has been revised to between 3.4 and 3.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A key measure in Jospin's package is a one-point cut in the
value-added tax, bringing the rate to 19.6 percent. All together,
the new tax measures announced Thursday bring the total tax cuts
planned for 2000 to $11.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The extra spending includes aid to those affected by fierce
December storms and an oil spill, and extra spending on the health
service and urban renewal. The package allocated $148 million for
urgent needs in education in response to teachers' complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers' protest was the latest in a series of
demonstrations and strikes by sectors of French society. On
Thursday, civil servants also took to the streets, protesting plans
to streamline the tax collection system.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T statue: Golden Boy without a permanent home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- No one wants the Golden Boy.
</P>
<P>
   For months, AT&AMP;T Corp. has been looking for someone to take in
its landmark statue, which is perched in front of the company's
Basking Ridge operational headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The telecommunications giant has offered to donate the 16-ton
statue to the New York City Parks and Recreation Department in
hopes of giving the golden gargantuan a new home near its former
spot on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the Golden Boy remains a Jersey boy.
</P>
<P>
   Originally named Genius of Electricity, then Spirit of
Communications, the 24-foot-tall statue covered in 14-carat gold
leaf was made in 1916 by sculptor Evelyn Beatrice Longman at a
Brooklyn foundry.
</P>
<P>
   The statue, wrapped in thick electrical cable, holds an end of
the cable in one hand and lightning bolts in the other.
</P>
<P>
   Golden Boy stood above AT&AMP;T's corporate building at 195 Broadway
until 1980, when it was removed for restoration.
</P>
<P>
   When AT&AMP;T moved to a Madison Avenue building in 1983, so did the
statue.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Golden Boy was restored again and moved to the main
entrance of AT&AMP;T's operational headquarters in Basking Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   Why find a new home for the statue?
</P>
<P>
   ''We're doing this so more people would be able to view Golden
Boy,'' AT&AMP;T spokesman John Heath said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But the search for Golden Boy's new home hasn't been easy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just too large and too gauche,'' said Jane Tifft, a
member of the Washington Market Park board in New York. ''It's just
a tiny little park with teeny little children and a gazebo for
birthday parties and Lady Bug Day,'' said Tifft in Thursday's
editions of The Star-Ledger of Newark.
</P>
<P>
   The search began three months ago, when Materials for the Arts,
an agency of the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs, got
a call from AT&AMP;T, said agency spokesman Tim Doyle. The agency then
placed calls to about 20 city organizations to help find a new
place for the statue, including the Department of Parks and
Recreation, Doyle said.
</P>
<P>
   About four weeks ago, the Department of Parks and Recreation
began its search to find a permanent spot for the statue, said
department spokesman Bob Lawson.
</P>
<P>
   ''We go out and inspect to see which site would be appropriate,
then we go through a formal process and see if it's OK with
community boards,'' said Lawson. ''We've been looking at several
sites and having informal meetings, but no one's been coming to us
saying it's too gaudy.''
</P>
<P>
   Several companies and museums have expressed interest in giving
Golden Boy a permanent home, Heath said. But he declined to mention
the organizations or locations.

<HEADLINE> Leeds, Arsenal Win in UEFA Cup  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Thierry Henry and Fredrik Ljungberg scored as Arsenal beat
Werder Bremen 2-0 Thursday night in the first leg UEFA Cup
quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   At Highbury in London, Henry scored in the 21st minute off a
long pass from Patrick Vieira that beat an offside trap, and
Ljungberg scored with 15 minutes left after collecting a shot that
Nwanko Kanu mis-hit.
</P>
<P>
   At Eiland Road, Leeds defeated Slavia Prague 3-0 as Lee Bowyer
scored one goal and set up another.
</P>
<P>
   Leeds fielded Bowyer even though he was due to appear in court
on Friday, accused of involvement in a racial attack on a
19-year-old Asian student in downtown Leeds in January. Another
Leeds star, Jonathan Woodgate, is scheduled to appear, as well, but
he was missing from Thursday's game because of an injury.
</P>
<P>
   Bowyer beat two Slavia players before setting up a goal for
Jason Wilcox six minutes before halftime. Harry Kewell scored in
the 54th and Bowyer connected six minutes later off a pass from
Michael Bridges.
</P>
<P>
   The wins highlighted English soccer's return as a European
soccer power. Defending champion Manchester United and Chelsea
already have clinched quarterfinal berths in the Champions Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey's Galatasaray won 4-1 at Mallorca and Celta de Vigo,
which ousted Juventus of Turin in the previous round, played a
scoreless tie at home against Lens.
</P>
<P>
   Galatasaray, coming off a victory over Borussia Dortmund, got
goals from Erdem Arif (45th minute), Belozoglu Emre (48th), Unsal
Hakan (58th) and Buruk Okan (64th). Bisan Lauren scored with 10
minutes left for Celta.

<HEADLINE> Mayors From Five Continents Gather  </HEADLINE>
By MARILYN AUGUST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- More than 30 mayors from five continents on
Thursday considered ways to make city life safer, cleaner and more
pleasant as the divide between rich and poor widens.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day Summit of World Mayors, which opened Thursday, was
''an open dialogue'' among urban leaders working in an increasingly
globalized world, said the host, Paris Mayor Jean Tiberi, in an
opening address.
</P>
<P>
   The summit features committees of mayors and international
specialists presenting programs geared to improve the quality of
urban life.
</P>
<P>
   Mayors Anthony A. Williams of Washington D.C. and Willie Brown
of San Francisco were among the 33 mayors at the summit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Being a mayor is all about picking up trash, cleaning the
streets, keeping them lighted and safe,'' Williams told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the goal in the U.S. capital -- celebrating its 200
birthday this year -- is to give all elementary school children
Internet access and provide high schoolers subsidies for college.
</P>
<P>
   Rio de Janeiro's mayor, architect Luis Paulo Conde, showed
slides documenting efforts to clean up Rio's notorious slums.
</P>
<P>
   Warsaw Mayor Pawel Piskorski outlined attempts to improve aging
public services while preserving the historical identity of a city
nearly completely destroyed during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many more people are driving cars, but the roads can't handle
them,'' he said. ''Warsaw is a mirror that reflects the advantages
and disadvantages of rapid economic growth.''
</P>
<P>
   During the summit, Tiberi and Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen will
inaugurate a new public square, la Place de Berlin, behind the
Champs-Elysees.
</P>
<P>
   The international attention coincides with a crisis at Paris
City hall.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Tiberi's conservative Rally for the Republic party
suspended him from the leadership of its local branch on suspicions
that he padded the party's Paris membership rolls. Tiberi He vowed
to prove the charges false.

<HEADLINE> 76ers' Allen Iverson Suspended  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Tension escalated between Allen Iverson and
Philadelphia 76ers management when he was suspended for at least
one game for missing the team's shootaround Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA scoring leader sat out Thursday night's 92-77 loss to
the Miami Heat, and he was angry afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt I had a better relationship with this organization,''
Iverson said. ''I don't think this is fair at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia owner Pat Croce said the suspension will likely be
for just one game, but coach Larry Brown was more vague.
</P>
<P>
   ''He missed practice today, but there's a lot more to it,''
Brown said. ''I've let it go too far. It's just the culmination of
a lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's game was important for the 76ers, who fell 5{ games
behind the first-place Heat in the Atlantic Division. Philadelphia
is at home against Utah on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson, 24, has clashed previously with Brown. Croce said the
All-Star guard missed practices a couple of weeks ago, but the
problem was temporarily resolved after a meeting with Brown.
</P>
<P>
   According to general manager Billy King, Iverson phoned the team
trainer Thursday morning to say he had a headache and wouldn't be
at the 11 a.m. shootaround. King called Iverson's hotel room
shortly thereafter, but there was no answer.
</P>
<P>
   King, who finally reached Iverson in his room after the workout,
said a headache wasn't an adequate excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told them I couldn't be at practice because I wasn't feeling
well,'' Iverson said. ''I guess that wasn't enough. ... I've been
here four years. They know who I am as a competitor, so don't
question my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Iverson said that after calling the trainer, he took two Advil
and went back to sleep. He became agitated when asked if he didn't
feel well because he had been out late on trendy South Beach night
before.
</P>
<P>
   ''You think I'm going to come to Miami from freezing Philly and
not go out?'' he said. ''I know how to take care of my body. I'm
not a little kid. I go out and come in when I want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Croce said speculation that Iverson was out late partying wasn't
an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know and I don't care,'' Croce said. ''I care about
team practice and team play. I'm not his babysitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Iverson will lose one-82nd of his salary for each game he's
suspended. His six-year, $70.9 million contract averages about
$144,000 per game.
</P>
<P>
   Brown suspended Iverson for one game three years ago for missing
a practice in New York. In December, Iverson lashed out at Brown
after being benched for the final 20 minutes of a loss at Detroit.
Iverson said then he should be traded if Brown was unhappy with
him.
</P>
<P>
   Croce said his reaction to the latest situation was
''disappointment, frustration, hurt. Allen knows we're counting on
him, and you can't miss work. If you miss work, you don't get paid
and you don't play.''
</P>
<P>
   Iverson met with King and Croce before the game. Croce said
Iverson expressed regret about the situation and understood the
reasons for the suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Croce said what he wants from Iverson is ''a commitment to this
team, this city, this franchise that he'll go out and kill it every
day all the way through the playoffs.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Ray Allen scored 28 points and Sam Cassell
added 22 as the Milwaukee Bucks beat the Houston Rockets 106-96
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Robinson added 19 as the Bucks handed the Rockets their
fifth straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Steve Francis, who matched his season high with 32 points
against New York on Tuesday, had 22 for the Rockets. Kelvin Cato
added 20 and Walt Williams had 19.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, held to five points in the first half, had 14 after
the break, including eight in the fourth period as the Bucks never
let the lead they grabbed in the third quarter slip away.
</P>
<P>
   The only scare came when Francis hit a 3-pointer that pulled
Houston to 93-87 with 3:29 left. But Robinson answered with a
13-foot jumper and the Bucks never let the margin fall below eight
points the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Houston held a 48-40 halftime lead and protected it until the
Bucks used a 14-5 run to close out the third quarter for a 71-68
lead. Allen helped chip away at the Rockets' lead with nine points
during the quarter before Cassell capped the surge with a free
throw and a jumper.
Notes: Francis picked up a technical for firing his mouth guard
into the crowd after being called for an offensive foul with 45.6
seconds left in the second. ... Bucks guard Vinny Del Negro missed
his second consecutive game with a stress reaction in his right
leg. ... The Bucks' Darvin Ham got a technical for his bad-boy
posturing after second-quarter dunk. ... Allen has scored in double
figures in every game this season. ... With 2:44 left in the third,
the shot clock froze at 21 seconds. After a quick conference, the
referees subtracted seven seconds.

<HEADLINE> Flyers 1, Canadiens 1  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Jeff Hackett made 38 saves as the Montreal
Canadiens tied the Philadelphia Flyers 1-1 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Tocchet scored for the Flyers, who moved within five points
of the Atlantic Division-leading New Jersey Devils. Sergei Zholtok
had Montreal's goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers were playing their second straight game without
captain Eric Lindros, who remained hospitalized Thursday night with
a post-traumatic migraine headache, the result of a concussion
suffered in a game two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros, admitted to the hospital Wednesday, is expected to be
sidelined at least 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett made six saves in overtime, including a glove save on
Mark Recchi's hard shot midway through the extra period. Hackett
stopped a point-blank shot by John LeClair 30 seconds into
overtime, and a hard shot by Mark Eaton seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   He also withstood a late flurry in the final minute of overtime.
</P>
<P>
   John Vanbiesbrouck preserved the tie with a kick save on a shot
by Zholtok in the final seconds. Vanbiesbrouck, making consecutive
starts for the first time in a month, stopped 25 shots. He had a
nice scoop save on a redirected shot by Brian Savage with 1:07 left
in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Former Flyer Karl Dykhuis had the best chance to win it, but hit
the crossbar on a shot from the slot with 38 seconds left in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers took a 1-0 lead when Tocchet put back his own rebound
after Dan McGillis fired a shot from just inside the blue line with
7:22 remaining in the first.
</P>
<P>
   The power-play goal was Tocchet's 14th and second since coming
back to the Flyers in a trade with Phoenix last week. It was the
Flyers' first power-play goal in three games.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadiens tied it on Zholtok's 23rd goal of the season 2:39
into the third. Former Flyer Dainius Zubrus set up the goal with a
centering pass, which Zholtok redirected over Vanbiesbrouck's glove
as Flyers defenseman Luke Richardson appeared to slightly screen
the goalie.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers had a chance to win the game in regulation, but
Daymond Langkow hit the side of an open net after controlling a
rebound off a shot by Valeri Zelepukin with just under three
minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia had a power play in the final two minutes, but did
not manage a shot.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett made four big saves in the first five minutes, including
a sliding stick save on Recchi one minute in, and a kick save on
LeClair minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   With Lindros out of the lineup, Keith Primeau centered the top
line.

Thomas Ferebee:
</P>
<P>
   WINDERMERE, Fla. (AP) -- Thomas Wilson Ferebee, the bombardier
who dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima in World War II, died
Thursday. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   Ferebee was 26 on Aug. 6, 1945, and already a major and a
veteran of 64 missions when the B-29 Enola Gay took off for Japan
with the first nuclear weapon ever deployed.
</P>
<P>
   Ferebee, who retired from the Air Force as a colonel in 1970,
said he never felt guilty but was sorry the bomb killed so many.
</P>
<P>
   America's bombing of Hiroshima and the blast at Nagasaki three
days later left more than 100,000 dead and led to the end of the
war.
</P>
<P>
   The only other man who has dropped a nuclear bomb in war,
Nagasaki bombardier Kermit Beahan, died in 1989. Japan surrendered
on Aug. 14, 1945, five days after the Nagasaki bomb was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Ferebee also participated in the first U.S. bombing raid on Nazi
occupied France in 1942 and was the lead bombardier for the Allies'
first 100-plane daylight raid in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, he served as a deputy commander for
maintenance in several B-47 Stratojet bomber wings. He flew aboard
B-47s during the Cold War and B-52s during the Vietnam War. His
decorations included the Silver Star, Legion of Merit, two
Distinguished Flying Crosses and the Bronze Star.
Ed Healey:
</P>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- One of Florida's longest-serving state
lawmakers died Wednesday after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage. He
was 75.
</P>
<P>
   The House set a black wreath in front of the chamber Thursday
and draped Healey's desk in black. Gov. Jeb Bush ordered flags on
state property to be flown at half staff until sunset Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Healey was third in seniority in the House. He was first elected
in November 1974 and served through 1980. He served another term
from 1982-1984, and has been in office since being elected again in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   In the Legislature, Healey was known for his work in
transportation and health care.
Robert Hillard:
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Robert E. Hillard, co-founder of the global
public relations firm Fleishman-Hillard Inc., died Wednesday of
emphysema. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Fleishman-Hillard began in 1946 when Hillard and Alfred
Fleishman opened a small office above a Woolworth store at Grand
Boulevard and Olive Street in St. Louis. The firm, with 45 offices
worldwide, is now the No. 1 public relations firm in the United
States and fifth largest in the world with annual billings of $213
million.
</P>
<P>
   Hillard retired in 1982. Even the day before his death, Hillard
remained a PR man, trying to pitch a story idea about his hospice
nurse to a Post-Dispatch reporter.
Durward Kirby:
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Versatile TV funnyman Durward Kirby, who for
years played second banana on ''The Garry Moore Show'' and for a
time was co-host of ''Candid Camera,'' died of congestive heart
failure Wednesday. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Starting out in radio in the Midwest, Kirby teamed up with Moore
off and on for 30 years, serving as announcer and performer on
Moore's early, live ''The Garry Moore Show'' on CBS-TV in 1950-51
and the highly successful variety show of the same name that ran
from 1958-64 and 1966-67.
</P>
<P>
   The variety show was known for making a star of Carol Burnett
and for its nostalgia segments, called ''That Wonderful Year.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirby was co-host of ''Candid Camera'' from 1961-66. The show
created by Allen Funt, which secretly filmed unsuspecting citizens
in amusing situations, had at one point been a segment of ''The
Garry Moore Show.
</P>
<P>
   He became so well-known to TV viewers that the Rocky and
Bullwinkle cartoons had a plotline about the search for ''Kirward
Derby,'' which could make its wearer the smartest man in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Kirby wrote three books: ''My Life, Those Wonderful Years,''
''Bits and Pieces of This and That'' and a children's book called
''Dooley Wilson.''
</P>
<P>
   He worked in radio in Indianapolis, Cincinnati and Chicago and
served in World War II before beginning his television career in
New York shortly after the war.
Roger Longrigg:
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Novelist Roger Longrigg's death on Feb.26, also
brought an end to the literary careers of Rosalind Erskine, Laura
Black, Ivor Drummond, Megan Barker, Grania Beckford, Frank Parrish
and Domini Taylor. He was 70.
</P>
<P>
   Longrigg adopted those pseudonyms for various literary
enterprises, although he also wrote a dozen books under his own
name as well.
</P>
<P>
   Longrigg's work in advertising supplied the setting and
inspiration for his first novel, ''A High Pitched Buzz,'' in 1956.
Further comic novels from the world of expense-account living
included ''Switchboard'' (1957), ''Wrong Number'' (1959), ''Love
Among the Bottles'' (1967) and ''The Jevington System'' (1973).
</P>
<P>
   Styling himself as a randy 15-year-old named Rosalind Erskine,
Longrigg had a best-seller in 1962 with ''The Passion Flower
Hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   Supposedly a true story about schoolgirls who set up a brothel,
''The Passion Flower Hotel'' was translated into German, French,
Dutch and Japanese. It was also the basis for one of Nastassia
Kinski's first film roles in ''Leidenschaftliche Bluemchen''
(1978).
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote thrillers set in the worlds of horse racing,
yachting and jet-setting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mother Love,'' a story of a jilted woman's obsessive love for
her son, was published as the work of Domini Taylor in 1983. It was
adapted as a British Broadcasting Corp. mini-series in 1989,
starring Diana Rigg and David McCallum.

<HEADLINE> Spring Training Rdp  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Instead of just playing a game Thursday, the Texas
Rangers and
Toronto Blue Jays got together and pulled off a three-way trade of
first basemen with the Montreal Expos.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a rare three-way deal, Toronto sent David Segui and cash to
Texas, which then dealt Lee Stevens to the Expos. To complete the
deal, Montreal sent Brad Fullmer to the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know how happy David would be DHing,'' Toronto manager
Jim Fregosi said. ''David will play more first with Texas than he
would have here.''
</P>
<P>
   Segui hit a combined .298 for Seattle and Toronto last season
with 14 homers and 52 RBIs. A .285 career hitter, he was dealt by
Seattle on July 28 for pitchers Tom Davey and Steve Sinclair,
became a free agent after the season, then signed a $4,325,000,
one-year contract to stay with the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens batted .282 last season for the Rangers, setting career
highs with 24 homers and 81 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I figured that they would release me before they would trade
me,'' Stevens said. ''It's going to be tough leaving Texas, because
it's the only place I have ever really stayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Fullmer split last season between Montreal and Triple-A Ottawa.
He batted .277 for the Expos with nine homers and 47 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ''My bat is my meal ticket,'' Fullmer said. ''I don't foresee
and problems as a DH, but I always thought my fielding was OK.'
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, left-hander Greg Cadaret was released by the
Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Cadaret, 38, was 0-1 with a 10.39 ERA in 4 1-3 innings this
spring. Signed by Anaheim as a minor league free agent Jan. 5, he
also pitched for the Angels from 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   On a high-scoring day, the San Francisco Giants beat the
Milwaukee Brewers 18-14, the Pittsburgh Pirates beat the Boston Red
Sox 14-11 and the Cleveland Indians beat the Kansas City Royals
11-10.
</P>
<P>
   At Scottsdale, Ariz., Milwaukee made eight errors and lost its
fifth straight.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Mark Loretta and first baseman Brian Banks made two
errors each for the Brewers, who have 13 in two games. Right
fielder Damon Hollins, pitcher Jim Bruske, catcher Creighton
Gubanich and second baseman Lou Collier also had error, but San
Francisco only scored three unearned runs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was probably one of the worst games you are ever going to
watch,'' Brewers manager Davey Lopes said. ''I'm not going to sit
here and criticize individuals. You can surmise it.''
</P>
<P>
   At Bradenton, Fla., Pat Meares went 4-for-4 with three RBIs and
hit two of Pittsburgh's seven home runs. Kevin Young, starting
pitcher Todd Ritchie, John Vander Wal, Bruce Aven and Keith Osik
also homered for the Pirates. Aven's shot was a grand slam in the
fourth inning. Israel Alcantara homered for Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was just one of those Florida days at McKechnie Field
where the wind was blowing and took everything right out of the
park,'' Meares said. ''I don't put a whole lot of stock in this.
It's nice to get some hits but spring training really doesn't
matter. None of this starts counting until April 3, when we start
playing for real.''
</P>
<P>
   At Winter Haven, Fla., Dave Roberts hit a grand slam and Enrique
Wilson capped Cleveland's nine-run ninth inning with a three-run
homer.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's home run off Billy Brewer followed a two-run hit by
Jacob Cruz and Roberts' grand slam, both off Ken Ryan. It mirrored
Kansas City's 1999 regular season, when the Royals' bullpen blew 30
saves.
</P>
<P>
   In other games:
Twins 7, Reds 5:
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Myers, Fla., Ken Griffey Jr. hit his fourth home run of
the spring, a drive into the lake behind the right-field wall off
LaTroy Hawkins.
Dodgers 9, Mets (ss) 3:
</P>
<P>
   At Vero Beach, Fla., Shawn Green hit his first home run in a Los
Angeles uniform, and Devon White, F.P. Santangelo and Paul LoDuca

innings.

</P>
<P>
   At Port St. Lucie, Fla., Albert Belle and Greg Myers hit their

Astros 6, Braves (ss) 5:
</P>
<P>
   At Kissimmee, Fla., Craig Biggio, in a 1-for-23 slump, went
2-for-2. He singled off Tom Glavine the first inning and doubled in
the second, raising his batting average to .120. Atlanta's other
squad played Florida at Viera and was rained out after 3{ scoreless
innings.
Cardinals 3, Expos 1:
</P>
<P>
   At Jupiter, Fla., Kent Bottenfield struck out seven in five
innings, allowing three hits.
Yankees 8, Phillies 4:

   At Clearwater, Fla., Ricky Ledee went 3-for-4 with two homers,
and Andy Ashby had his fourth straight inconsistent start, giving
up four runs and eight hits in five innings.
Devil Rays 4, Tigers 1:
</P>
<P>
   At St. Petersburg, Fla., Esteban Yan was sharp again in his bid
to earn the fifth spot in the Devil Rays rotation, allowing one run
and two hits in five innings with four strikeouts.
Blue Jays 6, Rangers 2:
</P>
<P>
   At Dunedin, Fla., Charlie Greene and Kevin Witt homered and

<HEADLINE> Clinton Burdened By Ireland Impasse  </HEADLINE>
By KEVIN GALVIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saying he was ''burdened'' by the impasse in
Northern Ireland, President Clinton appealed to leaders in the
peace process Thursday to put aside their differences and work to
restore the British province's independent government. ''We have
the chance of a lifetime here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton addressed the annual dinner of the American Ireland
Fund, attended by such important figures in the peace process as
David Trimble, leader of the pro-British Ulster Unionists party,
and Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, whose party is allied with the
Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever the differences, it's not worth another life -- not
one,'' Clinton said. ''It's not worth another day's delay, much
less a year.''
</P>
<P>
   The same day a top British official said he was ''growing
impatient'' with the stalemate in the Northern Ireland peace
process, U.S. officials cautioned against expecting a breakthrough
during St. Patrick's Day meetings with the visiting political
leaders at the White House and on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, Trimble and others were meeting individually with
lawmakers in Congress on Thursday and Friday. Clinton was meeting
with them separately Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd say this is more than just courtesy, but I also don't
anticipate any breakthrough,'' said White House press secretary Joe
Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the meetings and a holiday reception, Clinton was
welcoming Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern to the White House on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he was proud to have played a supporting role in
the peace process thus far. ''Tonight, I am more burdened by the
fact that I have not found an answer to the present stalemate,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I must confess as your friend that I still do not know the
answers,'' he said. ''But I do know life is fleeting, amd
opportunities come, and also go. We have the chance of a lifetime
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson suspended
the province's nascent coalition government last month because the
IRA refused to give up its weapons.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Mandelson urged both sides to use their visit to
Washington to restart the process.
</P>
<P>
   ''Stop walking away. Stop the silence. Stop the name calling.
Stop the blame game,'' he said at a news conference. ''Get back to
serious talks, serious business.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ''I am growing impatient with the parties. They need
to talk sensibly, treat each other sensibly and negotiate
sensibly.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson was meeting on Friday with Irish Foreign Secretary
Brian Cowen. British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Ahern plan to
meet in Lisbon, Portugal, next week.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson's decision to shutter the administration came after
Trimble vowed to withdraw his Ulster Unionists party from the
coalition because the IRA had not begun disarming.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein leaders noted that May 22 was the deadline for total
disarmament of the IRA and outlawed pro-British groups under the
Good Friday agreement overseen by former Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Unionists have refused to go back into the coalition government
before the IRA starts doing away with its weaponry. But the IRA has
never clearly said whether it will disarm. Sinn Fein, eager to
regain its two posts within the suspended 12-member administration,
argues the IRA might eventually disarm -- but only if unionists
allow the four-party coalition to work without obstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving for Washington, Adams said he considered the May
22 deadline now irrelevant because the government had been shut
down. Adams laid blame with those who he said ''confused and
subverted the entire process'' by making demands that were not part
of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials were using their meetings with the Northern
Ireland leaders to press for a resumption of the coalition
government and to seek flexibility from Trimble, while urging Adams
to ensure that the IRA takes concrete steps toward decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
   ''The suspension was not caused by any failure of the
institutions themselves, nor by any violation of the agreement, but
by an internal political crisis focused on the issue of
decommissioning,'' the Friends of Ireland said in a statement
Thursday. The executive committee of the group, comprised of U.S.
lawmakers, includes Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and House
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices rose Friday morning, boosted by
a record surge on Wall Street. The dollar edged higher against the
yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 160.47
points, or 0.83 percent, to 19,413.70 at the end of the morning
session. On Thursday, the average closed up 174.63 points, or 0.92
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 105.95 yen, up 0.47 yen from late Thursday in
Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 105.56 yen.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, prices advanced as high technology issues
and telecommunication stocks were leading the way after the Dow
Jones industrial average rose 499.19, or 4.9 percent, to 10,630.60
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   That shattered the Dow's previous record one-day rise of 380.53
points, set Sept. 8, 1998, but was not close to a record percentage
gain.
</P>
<P>
   Also in New York, the Nasdaq composite index rose 134.77 to
finish at 4,717.39.
</P>
<P>
   Also supporting Friday's gains was Japanese government optimism
on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   In a monthly report, the Economic Planning Agency said signs of
recovery are emerging in areas such as corporate capital
investment, through it said the nation's overall economic situation
remains severe.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 16.27 points, or 0.98 percent, to 1,661.84.
The TOPIX closed up 40.14 points, or 2.5 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar edged higher early Friday after
Japanese and U.S. Institutional investors bought the euro against
the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The euro drew investor interest after the European Central Bank
raised its key interest rate Thursday by a quarter-point to 3.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   A higher interest rate tends to make a nation's currency more
attractive to investors.
</P>
<P>
   The euro was traded at 102.67 yen, up from 102.34 late Thursday
in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell
to 1.8250 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.8400 percent. Its
price rose 0.12 point to 99.78.

   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- Downhill racer Kjersti Bjorn-Roli of
Anchorage, Alaska, a promising World Cup skier when she was
healthy, has retired from ski racing and entered college after
three knee operations, the U.S. Ski Team said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Bjorn-Roli, the 1994 NorAm downhill champion and winner of a

before returning a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bjorn-Roli, 23, who was back in some World Cup this winter, said
race courses ''are rougher and the conditions harsher, and that

stop racing.

</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- The Vermont House approved a bill today allowing gays
to form ''civil unions,'' the closest thing to gay marriage America has ever
seen. If the bill becomes law, the state will have gone further than any other
in recognizing same-sex couples. The federal government still would not
recognize such unions with regard to such things as immigration rights, Social
Security and federal taxes. Vermont's Senate is expected to approve the bill by

battered by Wall Street's frenzy for technology stocks. The Dow Jones industrial

move after the Communist Party daily Granma in an editorial Tuesday slammed the
U.S. Cuban Adjustment Act, a 1966 law that allows Cubans who reach U.S. soil to
apply for U.S. residency. Cuba says the law violates 1994 and 1995 migration

Zimbabwe Guerrillas Threaten War

   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Militant black ex-guerrillas said Thursday they are
ready to go to war, and would even fight to overthrow President Robert Mugabe,
if his government moves to halt their seizures of white-owned farms. Veterans of
the bush war for independence and other squatters armed with spears, axes,
knives and guns have invaded 549 farms this month, but have since abandoned 116.
Mugabe announced Friday that the squatters could stay on land they occupied, but
his government is coming under increasing pressure to stop the takeovers, which
experts say could hurt farm production.

<HEADLINE> Appeals Court Rejects Exxon Appeal  </HEADLINE>
By T.A. BADGER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- An appeal by the Exxon Corp. on the $5
billion Valdez oil spill civil verdict was rejected Thursday
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco-based 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the
verdict should not be thrown out because of irregularities during
jury deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of the punitive damages verdict was one of several
filed by Exxon and co-defendant Joseph Hazelwood, who was in charge
of the tanker Exxon Valdez when it drove onto a charted reef in
Prince William Sound in March 1989 and spilled 11 million gallons
of Alaska crude oil.
</P>
<P>
   The spill, the nation's worst ever, polluted more than 1,000
miles of shoreline, killed tens of thousands of birds and marine
mammals, and disrupted fishing.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal in question focused on the behavior of Don Warrick, a
court bailiff who escorted the jury and served it food during the
five months of trial and deliberations in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   After the verdict, an Anchorage newspaper reported that the
deliberations were highly emotional, and that juror Rita Wilson was
especially stressed out by the process and not getting along well
with the others.
</P>
<P>
   Judge H. Russel Holland convened a hearing after the story was
published.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Graham, another of the jurors, told the judge during the
hearing that the bailiff suggested to him one morning that the
others might want to put Wilson ''out of her misery.''
</P>
<P>
   While saying this, the bailiff pulled out his gun and took out
one of its bullets, the juror said. The bailiff at first denied the
allegation, but later admitted he made the comments as a joke.
Warrick lost his job. He died from a heart attack a few months
later.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon argued that the bailiff's comments were inappropriate and
coercive.
</P>
<P>
   Holland ruled that a new trial wasn't warranted because Wilson
didn't know during the deliberations about a conversation between
Warrick and Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're pleased to have one of the collateral skirmishes out of
the way,'' said Anchorage lawyer David Oesting, part of the legal
team representing fishermen and other plaintiffs. ''I think it was
a grasp at straws by Exxon.''
</P>
<P>
   Exxon spokesman Bob Davis would not comment on the ruling
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Islanders 4, Thrashers 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Stephen Valiquette made 37 saves to win his first
career NHL start as the New York Islanders beat the Atlanta
Thrashers 4-2 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Isbister, Olli Jokinen, Josh Green and Tim Connolly each
scored for the Islanders, who improved to 14-7-6 when scoring
first.
</P>
<P>
   Yannick Trembley and Mike Stapleton scored for Atlanta, which
lost its 10th straight.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta dropped to 1-24-2 since beating Philadelphia 1-0 on Jan.
14. The Thrashers, whose 34 points are worst in the NHL, broke an
0-for-28 power-play streak, but failed to convert on four other
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Valiquette, recalled from Lowell of the AHL on Feb. 29, faced 39
shots after playing just 20 previous minutes in the NHL. The
22-year-old stopped four of five shots in an appearance at Phoenix
on March 9.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders, whose 51 points rank third-worst in the league,
avenged two home losses to Atlanta earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   Isbister put New York up 1-0 at 7:30 of the first by scoring his
18th goal from eight feet out from the right side of the crease.
</P>
<P>
   Isbister missed a penalty shot a few minutes later, as Thrashers
goalie Damian Rhodes stopped his shot. Rhodes, who caused the
penalty shot by throwing his stick at the puck, stopped 23 of 27
shots, and fell to 3-10-2.
</P>
<P>
   Jokinen put New York up 2-0 with a wraparound shot 15:15 into
the first following a nice give-and-go with Dave Scatchard.
</P>
<P>
   Green made it 3-0 by stealing the puck against the right boards
from Stapleton 7:41 into the second. Green's 12th goal, from the
left side of the right circle, sailed under Rhodes' glove side.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly took advantage of a loose puck that bounced off
Tremblay's leg to give New York a 4-0 lead 4:30 later. Connolly
easily wristed a shot under Rhodes' left leg for his 12th goal.
</P>
<P>
   Tremblay broke Atlanta's scoreless power-play streak by scoring
his eighth goal from the top of the left side of the slot.
</P>
<P>
   Stapleton's power-play goal made it 4-2 with 9:20 remaining. He
knocked in his 10th goal on a rebound that followed Ray Ferraro's
slap shot from the top of the slot.

<HEADLINE> Officials Insist Costa Rica Is Safe  </HEADLINE>
By ERIC NUNEZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PUERTO VIEJO, Costa Rica (AP) -- Costa Rica has been called ''the
Switzerland of Central America'' for its safety and stability, but
some residents said Thursday they fear that this week's murder of
two U.S. women may have damaged that valuable perception.
</P>
<P>
   The image has helped the country attract thousands of U.S.
retirees, an annual flow of almost $1 billion in tourism revenues
and more than 1 million tourists, some of whom probably wouldn't
venture into the rest of turbulent Central America.
</P>
<P>
   ''The image now is that something crazy happened in paradise,''
tour operator Ed Oliver said. ''Something like this, of course,
it's going to hurt business,'' said Oliver, who moved here three
years ago from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of Emily Howell, of Lexington, Ky., and Emily Eagen,
of Ann Arbor, Mich., were found by a roadside Monday in the
Caribbean coast town of Cahuita, about 10 miles northwest of Puerto
Viejo. Both were 19.
</P>
<P>
   Costa Rican police said Thursday they have leads, but have not
made arrests. The discovery of the bodies came just two weeks after
an Austrian man who owned a local hotel was killed near Puerto
Viejo.
</P>
<P>
   Costa Rica has no army, has promoted ecotourism and played a
peacemaker role in the Central American wars of the 1980s, creating
a tranquil image that is a valuable asset for Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the things that helped the country attract Intel
Corp.'s main Latin American computer chip factory.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 30,000 U.S. citizens live in the country; many of
them are retirees attracted by the climate and relative low cost of
life. Tourism, with $900 million in annual revenues, is the
country's second-largest industry.
</P>
<P>
   Costa Rica is also a popular location for U.S. university
study-abroad programs, such as the one Howell was involved in at
Antioch College of Yellow Springs, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   At the school Thursday, mourners attended a private memorial
service for the women. ''We are a very intimate and supportive
community and are coping with this tragic incident as best we
can,'' said college President Robert Devine.
</P>
<P>
   He said the college plans to plant trees in the women's honor to
''help remind us of the promise and spirit of these remarkable
young people.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Costa Rica have hurried to insist that the killings
were unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ''Costa Rica has been and is a safe country,'' said Rogelio
Ramos, the minister of public security. ''This could have happened
anywhere in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Embassy here says that Costa Rica ''in general'' is a
safe country. ''Our recommendation to tourists is that they take
the same precautions that one would take going to a big city in the
United States, such as New York or Los Angeles,'' said an official
at the embassy, where policy prohibits most on-record comments.
</P>
<P>
   But violence against foreigners is not unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The best-known case may be the 1997 slaying of rancher Max
Dalton, 78, who was shot during a property dispute in southern
Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, two elderly Americans were slain in their house in
the northern province of Guanacaste. Robbery is believed to have
been the motive in those killings, but no arrests been made in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   And the area around Puerto Viejo, which caters to youthful
backpackers, has been troubled by crime. Earlier this month, the
Austrian businessman and a Costa Rican executive were killed in
separate incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes me feel a little worried and nervous being here and
going out all by myself'' said Jamien Shields, a student from
Colorado College in Colorado Springs who is studying the fishing
and tourism industries on the coast of Limon province.
</P>
<P>
   Local businessmen and politicians say they fear the killings
could cause an economic setback for Limon, Costa Rica's poorest
province and one hurt by the decline of the banana industry.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman for the area, Walter Robinson, said there are
already signs that trips are being canceled. ''That would be
disastrous for Limon,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Wanger, a Boston man who owns the cabin the slain women
were renting, expressed regret both at the deaths and at the
hardship the crime could cause local friends.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really unfortunate. You don't how hard how people around
here have worked for years to promote the image of this zone,'' he
said. ''Ninety-nine percent of the people here depend on tourism.''

<HEADLINE> Mavericks 110, Spurs 88  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Erick Strickland scored 26 points and hit
five of his team's 12 3-pointers as the Dallas Mavericks scorched
the San Antonio Spurs 110-88.
</P>
<P>
   It was their first win in the Alamodome since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks, only 27-37 and not close to postseason
contention, have beaten playoff-bound Phoenix, Indiana and San
Antonio in the last six days after losing six in a row.
</P>
<P>
   While Dallas sizzled offensively, San Antonio was lethargic in
its first game since Tuesday night's emotional return of Sean
Elliott from a kidney transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott started and played the first eight minutes, but he did
not see action in the second half after his right groin tightened
up. He had two points, hitting a base-line jumper, and four
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically, it's just like having a training camp injury,''
Spurs spokeman Tom James said late in the game. ''It's nothing
serious, but we decided to hold him out as a precaution.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Finley added 22 points for the Mavs, who shot 51.9
percent from the field and even better, 52.2 percent, from 3-point
range (12-of-23.
</P>
<P>
   David Robinson led San Antonio with 20 points, although neither
he nor Tim Duncan played in the fourth quarter with the game out of
hand. Duncan had just 10 points and did not return after drawing
back-to-back offensive fouls in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio last led at 9-8 and never got closer than eight
points in the last three quarters. Dallas built as much as a
30-point lead as a smattering of boos filtered through the
cavernous arena.
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped San Antonio (41-24) three games behind
Midwest-Division-leading Utah (43-20) going into the final month of
the season. The Spurs have 17 games remaining and the Jazz have 19.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The 110 points was the second most against the Spurs
this season. San Antonio ranked first in scoring defense in the
league, allowing just 90.0 points a game . . . With the return of
Elliott and Malik Rose, the Spurs are getting healthier. But they
have missed 203 games to injury compared to 99 last season. The
only Spurs still on the injured list are guards Terry Porter and
Steve Kerr. Porter has a left knee ligament strain and Kerr a
swollen right knee. Neither is expected back in the neer future.
Rose's return after missing six games with a sprained ankle against
Atlanta went virtually unnoticed . . . Dallas has logged a
league-high 281 games missed to injury, but forward Cedric
Ceballos, the team's second-leading scorer, played despite having
the flu.

   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- The Vermont House approved a bill today allowing gays
to form ''civil unions,'' the closest thing to gay marriage America has ever
seen. If the bill becomes law, the state will have gone further than any other
in recognizing same-sex couples. The federal government still would not
recognize such unions with regard to such things as immigration rights, Social
Security and federal taxes. Vermont's Senate is expected to approve the bill by

move after the Communist Party daily Granma in an editorial Tuesday slammed the
U.S. Cuban Adjustment Act, a 1966 law that allows Cubans who reach U.S. soil to
apply for U.S. residency. Cuba says the law violates 1994 and 1995 migration
accords with the United States aimed at encouraging orderly, legal immigration.

Zimbabwe Guerrillas Threaten War

if his government moves to halt their seizures of white-owned farms. Veterans of
the bush war for independence and other squatters armed with spears, axes,
knives and guns have invaded 549 farms this month, but have since abandoned 116.
Mugabe announced Friday that the squatters could stay on land they occupied, but
his government is coming under increasing pressure to stop the takeovers, which
experts say could hurt farm production.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Steve Sullivan scored 1:39 into overtime to lift
the Chicago Blackhawks to a 5-4 victory over the Boston Bruins on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan redirected Michael Nylander's pass from the corner, as
the Blackhawks won their fourth straight.
</P>
<P>
   Nylander had a goal and two assists, while Michal Grosek, Tony
Amonte and Boris Mironov also scored for Chicago. Grosek's goal was
his first since the Blackhawks acquired him from Buffalo on March
10.
</P>
<P>
   Mironov scored from the edge of the crease with 13.7 seconds
remaining in regulation and goalie Jocelyn Thibault on the bench to
tie it at 4 to force overtime. Mironov converted a behind-the-net
pass from Alex Zhamnov.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Samsonov had a goal and an assist for Boston. Ken
Belanger, Mike Knuble and Joe Thornton also scored for the Bruins,
who hadn't played since Saturday at Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Boston, which outshot Chicago 38-27, held an 11-1 shot advantage
in the opening nine minutes and led 2-0 by 5:20 of the first on
goals by Belanger and Samsonov, who scored 41 seconds apart.
</P>
<P>
   Belanger and Samsonov converted loose rebounds from the crease
and put them past Thibault.
</P>
<P>
   Grosek cut it to 2-1 with 4:59 left in the first when his
back-hand deflection slid through Bruins goalie Rob Tallas.
</P>
<P>
   Knuble gave the Bruins a 3-1 lead at 7:24 of the second by
completing a 2-on-1 break with Brian Rolston.
</P>
<P>
   Nylander trimmed it to 3-2 with 5:29 left in the second, but
Thornton restored Boston's two-goal lead, 4-2, by chipping in a
rebound with 2:04 left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Amonte scored with 7:16 remaining in the third on a goal-mouth
deflection to make it 4-3.

<HEADLINE> Judge Dismisses Swimmers' Motion  </HEADLINE>
By BEN DiPIETRO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU (AP) -- A state judge dismissed a motion Thursday to
delay the NCAA Swimming and Diving Championships to allow Hawaii
swimmers to resolve problems with the NCAA over their qualifying
times.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit Judge Gail Nakatani ruled in favor of an NCAA motion to
dismiss the swimmers' request for a temporary restraining order to
stop the championships.
</P>
<P>
   The women's championships began Thursday in Indianapolis. The
men's competition is scheduled to start March 23 in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ruling, a lawyer for the university was awaiting a
decision on appeal filed by the university to allow the nationally
ranked men's 400-meter relay team to compete. The university wasn't
a party to the TRO request.
</P>
<P>
   No time frame has been given to the university as to when the
NCAA will rule on the appeal, or even if it will, lawyer Jan
Gouveia said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ruled the swimmers didn't prove they entered into a
contract with the NCAA when they signed documents outlining
requirements to maintain eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   The statements are ''lacking in the essential requirement of a
contract,'' the judge said. Even if they were considered contracts,
the judge said ''it's impossible to conclude the NCAA dealt with
the plaintiffs unfairly, unreasonably or capriciously.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Seitz, lawyer for the swimmers, said his clients still
haven't been told why their applications to compete were rejected,
although athletic director Hugh Yoshida testified Wednesday there
were errors in paperwork sent to the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   The judge was wrong to say the swimmers' signed statements
aren't contracts, Seitz said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically a contract, you're told on your first day of law
school, consists of certain elements. It consists of an offer, an
acceptance and something called consideration, you pay something,
you perform something, you do something,'' Seitz said.
</P>
<P>
   The offer from the NCAA, Seitz said, was that the swimmers could
participate in NCAA-sanctioned events if they agreed to take drug
tests and to meet other eligibility requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ''The kids signed. They agreed to do all those things and
they've done all those things,'' Seitz said.
</P>
<P>
   NCAA lawyer Linda Salfrank refused comment and a local lawyer
hired by the NCAA said he was prohibited by the organization from
speaking about the case.
</P>
<P>
   The swimmers expressed disappointment with the ruling, and
haven't decided whether to pursue further legal action.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just want to swim. We never have been told what we did
wrong,'' said Simon Thirsk, whose times in individual events are
among the 50 best in the world this year and who is a member of the
relay team.
</P>
<P>
   ''The judge has clearly said the NCAA doesn't need to answer to
any rules,'' Thirsk said.
</P>
<P>
   Swimmer Melanie Zauder said not being able to compete in the
championships deprives her of one of her two chances to qualify for
the U.S. Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was going to try to qualify for Olympic team at NCAA
Championships, and now I don't have the chance, leaving me only
with one event with which to qualify,'' the U.S. Olympic trials,
Zauder said.
</P>
<P>
   Seitz said the decision shows the arrogance and heavy-handed
approach the NCAA takes to student-athletes it claims to support.
</P>
<P>
   ''It tells them that the NCAA certainly is not interested in
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They use this lofty language about student-athletes, about
athletic experiences being part of your education. The education
these kids got today was about something very nasty and very
negative. They learned the NCAA is a pretty rotten and disturbed
organization.''

   DETROIT (AP) -- Mats Sundin scored on a power play 1:38 into
overtime as the Toronto Maple Leafs beat the Detroit Red Wings 4-3
on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Berezin, who had two goals and an assist, scored with 8.2
seconds left in the third period to sent the game to OT. Dmitri
Khristich also scored for Toronto, which snapped Detroit's
season-high eight-game unbeaten streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Maple Leafs have won six of their last seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Yzerman had two of three straight third-period goals that
rallied Detroit from a 2-0 deficit. Brendan Shanahan also scored
for the Red Wings, who remained four points behind St. Louis in the
battle for first place in the Central Division and the top seed in
the Western Conference playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Sundin scored the game-winner 46 seconds after Detroit's Chris
Chelios took a double-minor for high sticking Igor Korolev in the
first minute of overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Thomas started the play by making a pass to Tomas Kaberle,
who broke in 2-on-1 and drew defenseman Larry Murphy to him before
passing to Sundin for an easy score.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit led 3-2 after Yzerman's second goal with 6:39 left in
the third period.
</P>
<P>
   But, with the Maple Leafs skating 6-on-5 in the final seconds,
Berezin slipped the puck past goalie Chris Osgood to end a wild
scramble in front of the net. Detroit argued the goal, saying
Sundin interfered with Osgood in the crease.
</P>
<P>
   Replays showed Sundin was in the crease after hitting Detroit's
Steve Duchesne, but Sundin was pushed farther in by Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto goalie Curtis Joseph had 36 saves and Osgood made 23
stops.
</P>
<P>
   The teams delayed playing the final 4:31 of the first period
when glass behind the Toronto goal cracked, the second such delay
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Berezin scored 2:41 after play resumed when he broke in with a
bouncing pass from Gerald Diduck and easily beat Osgood.
</P>
<P>
   Khristich made it 2-0 on a power play 12:57 into the second. He
took a short pass from Berezin near the crease and backhanded it in
before Osgood could recover.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan scored a wraparound goal on a power play 16 seconds
into the third.
</P>
<P>
   Yzerman tied it on another power play at 9:45 when he took a
pass from Sergei Fedorov in the right circle and blasted a shot
past Joseph, who was screened by Tomas Holmstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Yzerman then split two defensemen at the Toronto line before
beating Joseph again to put Detroit ahead.

<HEADLINE> Students Plead Innocent to Charges  </HEADLINE>
By LUIS CABRERA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHIMACUM, Wash. (AP) -- Two middle school students pleaded
innocent Thursday to charges they plotted to shoot their
classmates, teachers and administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Mascho, 12, and Jill Martin, 14, appeared in Jefferson
County Juvenile Court handcuffed at the waist with double links of
chain wrapped around their bodies. Bail was set at $50,000 for the
boy and $5,000 for the girl.
</P>
<P>
   Both were charged Wednesday as juveniles with conspiracy to
commit first-degree murder. The boy also was charged with taking a
motor vehicle without permission to travel to Tacoma, about 90
miles to the southeast, to allegedly buy weapons and recruit help
from his cousin's gang-member friends.
</P>
<P>
   Police say the boy hatched the shooting spree plan, and the girl
suggested refinements, including cutting phone lines, using gun
silencers and warning friends to stay away on the chosen day.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's a 14-year-old kid. He's 12. They're not going to kill
anybody,'' said the girl's lawyer, Craddock Verser.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's lawyer, John Hynson, said he would make a motion to
dismiss the charges at a pretrial hearing next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The two students were expelled from Chimacum Middle School
earlier this month. They were described in court papers as unhappy
with how they were treated by fellow students and staff.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, prosecutors will seek to keep them in custody
until they are 21.
</P>
<P>
   About 360 students attend the school in Chimacum, a small town
60 miles northwest of Seattle.

<HEADLINE> Shadow Cabinet Forms in Czech Rep.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- A legislator for the ruling Social
Democratic party introduced female shadow cabinet Thursday as a
counterbalance to the Czech Republic's male-only government.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's partly a joke, a bit of fun, but partly also an attempt
to give women a chance to be more visible in politics,'' Jana
Volfova told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The shadow cabinet comprises eighteen ministers, including
former shot put world champion Helena Fibingerova, who heads the
sports ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Volfova, a women's rights activist, said the shadow cabinet was
a reaction to Premier Milos Zeman's recent statement that there are
not enough women in his Social Democratic party who could hold
cabinet posts.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is no feminist action, we simply want to prove the
premier was wrong,'' Volfova said.
</P>
<P>
   Zeman, who was also present at the news conference, said he has
always chosen his ministers according to their skills, not gender.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to Prague this month, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright only women to a discussion about their role in
Czech politics. Participants claimed she did so partially in
response to Zeman's statement.
</P>
<P>
   A number of female ministers served in Czech governments between
the fall of communism in 1989 and general elections in 1998, after
which the Social Democrats came to power.

<HEADLINE> US To Offer Ease on Luxury Imports  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a move to encourage reformists in Iran, the
Clinton administration is ready to announce a lifting of a ban on
imports of luxury goods and to offer a settlement of claims with
Tehran, a senior U.S. official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will make the offer in a
major policy speech here Friday to the American-Iranian Council, a
private group based in Princeton, N.J., that seeks better relations
with Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   The partial easing of sanctions and the offer to discuss claims
each nation has against the other will be coupled with a renewed
proposal for formal talks, said the official, who declined to be
identified.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Iran has not responded to the U.S. proposal to end more
than two decades of estrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Even as President Clinton this week extended sanctions against
Iran, the administration explored ways to encourage reformists
there.
</P>
<P>
   One way under consideration and then approved was to lift the
ban on imports of such Iranian goods as carpets, caviar and
pistachio nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Trade in oil, oil equipment and other major economic areas will
remain prohibited for Americans, the official, who has read
Albright's speech, told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Another official, who also declined to be identified, said the
administration was making significant gestures to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sanctions can be modified at any time,'' James B. Foley, a
State Department spokesman, said earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe there are important changes in Iran, and we are
considering ways to respond to those changes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Conciliatory statements by Iranian President Mohammed Khatami
and then the election last month to parliament of candidates
considered moderate by some American analysts have accelerated
moves within the administration to open talks with Iran after more
than two decades of estrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have questioned whether an easing of sanctions
would elicit a response or simply amount to a unilateral U.S.
concession.
</P>
<P>
   An easing of sanctions also would suggest that U.S. attempts to
isolate Iran economically have not succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Albright and other top U.S. officials have stressed that the
administration would level charges that Iran supports terrorism, is
trying to sabotage Middle East peacemaking and seeks weapons of
mass destruction in any formal meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, the United States exempted agricultural and medical
products from sanctions on Iran and other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are looking for ways to respond to changes in Iran, and to
advance prospects for a better relationship,'' Foley said. ''It is
something that is under internal consideration -- how best to
respond.''

<HEADLINE> Gonzaga Knocks Off Louisville  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Louisville has the name. Gonzaga has the game.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gonzaga, the little Jesuit school that became the darling of
last season's NCAA tournament with its improbable run to the West
Regional final, knocked off Louisville 77-66 in Tucson, Ariz., on
Thursday night behind Richie Frahm's 31 points.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not a Cinderella team anymore,'' Gonzaga guard Ryan
Floyd said. ''Last year was different because people didn't know
who we were. This year we're as talented as we were last year.
We're not expecting any Cinderella treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   As they were last year, the Bulldogs are seeded 10th in the
West. A year ago, their first victim was No. 7 seed Minnesota. This
time, the seventh-seeded Cardinals of coach Denny Crum couldn't
stop the scrappy and accurate 'Zags.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a season-high 24 turnovers, Gonzaga pulled away in the
second half with timely shooting and a tight defense that held
Louisville to 38 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had open shots all over the gym and we just couldn't make
them,'' Crum said. ''That's about as bad as we can shoot it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs (25-8) play the winner of Thursday night's Northern
Arizona-St. John's game in Saturday's second round.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Santangelo added 16 points for Gonzaga and Axel Dench had
14 points, six rebounds and six assists. The Bulldogs shot 57
percent from the field, going 8-for-16 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   Marques Maybin scored 21 points for Louisville (19-12), making
its 23rd NCAA appearance in Crum's 29 seasons at the school.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's other second-round game in Tucson, Purdue will
face Oklahoma. Purdue beat Dayton 62-61, and Oklahoma routed
Winthrop 74-50.
</P>
<P>
   In other West Regional play in Salt Lake City, it was Texas 77,
Indiana State 61; LSU 64, Southeast Missouri State 61; and Arizona
71, Jackson State 47. Wisconsin faced Fresno State in the late
game.
</P>
<P>
   Play also began Thursday in the Midwest Regional in Cleveland
and Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   In Cleveland, it was Kentucky 85, St. Bonaventure 80, 2OT;
Syracuse 79, Samford 65; and Michigan State 65, Valparaiso 38. Utah
played Saint Louis in the late game.
</P>
<P>
   In Minneapolis, it was Auburn 72, Creighton 69; Iowa State 88,
Central Connecticut State 78; and Maryland 74, Iona 59. In the late
game, UCLA played Ball State.
West Regional:

Winthrop (21-9) with 21 points.
Purdue 62, Dayton 61:
</P>
<P>
   Jaraan Cornell hit three 3-pointers in the final nine minutes as
sixth-seeded Purdue beat 11th-seeded Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton's David Morris had a chance to win it in the final
seconds, but his 40-footer hit the side of the backboard.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cardinal led Purdue (22-9) with 18 points, and Cornell
finished with 13. Tony Stanley and Mark Ashman each had 16 points

10th-seeded Creighton.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers (24-9) will face Iowa State on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   With Auburn ahead 72-63 with 12.7 seconds left, Tigers coach
Cliff Ellis felt so confident that he put team manager Jimbo
Tolbert into the game. Ellis put the sophomore on the team's roster
for the NCAA tournament after injuries and star Chris Porter's
suspension left extra room at the end of the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Creighton (23-10) got a 3-pointer from Ryan Sears, and Tolbert
turned the ball over on the inbounds play. Terrell Taylor hit
another 3 to make it 72-69 with 3.8 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers again turned the ball over on the inbounds, giving
Creighton a chance to tie. But Walker was closely guarded by
N'diaye, who got his hand on the ball as it was released.
Iowa St. 88, Central Connecticut St. 78:
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Fizer had 27 points and 11 rebounds and Jamaal Tinsley

<P>
   Juan Dixon added 20 points for the Terps (25-9), who jumped
ahead 23-4 and led 60-32 midway through the second half. Tariq
Kirksay had 24 points for the Gaels (20-11).
At Cleveland:
Kentucky 85, St. Bonaventure 80, 2OT:
</P>
<P>
   Fifth-seeded Kentucky held off 12th-seeded St. Bonaventure in
the Wildcats' first double-overtime game in their storied NCAA
tournament history.
</P>
<P>
   Tayshaun Prince scored 28 points for the Wildcats (23-9), who
will play fourth-seeded Syracuse on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   St. Bonaventure (21-10) rallied from a 13-point deficit in the
second half, and came from five down in the final eight seconds of
the first overtime. Kentucky's Marvin Stone fouled David Messiah
Capers attempting a 3-pointer with less than a second to go, and he
made all three shots to tie it.
Syracuse 79, Samford 65:
</P>
<P>
   Jason Hart and Preston Shumpert each scored 17 points as
fourth-seeded Syracuse beat 13th-seeded Samford.

Rawlings had 28 points for Samford (21-11).

shooting (13-for-52) from the field. Lubos Barton led Valparaiso
with 13 points.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Minister: Talks To Resume  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Peace talks involving Syria, Lebanon and
Israel likely will resume within weeks, Syrian Defense Minister
Mustafa Tlass said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''President Bill Clinton is making sincere and superhuman
efforts to revive the talks,'' Tlass told journalists in Bnashei, a
resort village 50 miles north of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   Tlass said he expected talks to resume within weeks, but did not
elaborate. He was in Bnashei for lunch with Suleiman Franjieh, a
Lebanese Cabinet minister closely allied with the Syrian
government.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian-Israeli talks, which resumed in December after a nearly
four-year break, were postponed indefinitely in January. Syria has
said it won't return to the table until Israel pledges to withdraw
to the 1967 prewar borders.
</P>
<P>
   The recent appointment of a new government in Damascus sparked
speculation talks would resume soon.
</P>
<P>
   Syria is the main power-broker in Lebanon, which refuses to
conduct separate peace talks with Israel. Israel keeps 1,500
soldiers in southern Lebanon, but announced recently it would
withdraw them by July. Doing so could weaken Syria's hand in its
own negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Israeli warplanes fired missiles at suspected
guerrilla targets Thursday in southern Lebanon, Lebanese security
officials said on customary condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, an Israeli military spokesman confirmed the
strikes and said the jets returned safely to base.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known what prompted the attacks near Birket Jabbour,
10 milea from Israel's northern border. No casualties or damage
were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Tlass called the Israeli Cabinet's decision to withdraw even if
their is no Syrian-Israeli agreement ''one of the maneuvers and
trial balloons Israel launches to split the Syrian-Lebanese
track.''

<HEADLINE> Hamas Extremist Suspects Surrender  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) -- Two suspected extremists surrendered
Thursday after Palestinian police surrounded a house in Nablus.
Palestinian sources said the men belonged to an extremist Hamas
cell involved in a shootout in Israel two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian security chief Jibril Rajoub and Nablus mayor
Ghassan Shaka negotiated with the men as about 200 police cordoned
off the area. The two surrendered before a deadline set by the
police ran out.
</P>
<P>
   Shaka said they were from Gaza. He said there was a large
quantity of weapons in the house, but could give no further
details.
</P>
<P>
   Israel television reported that Israeli intelligence tipped
Palestinian security about the two men.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian sources said the men are connected to Hamas
extremists discovered in the Israeli Arab city of Taibeh March 2,
before they could carry out attacks in Israel. Four Palestinians
were killed and one surrendered during a day-long confrontation
with Israeli forces there. Several bombs exploded in the house.

<HEADLINE> Iowa St.'s Sanderson Wins Matches  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Iowa State's Cael Sanderson, who last year
became the first freshman selected most outstanding wrestler in the
NCAA championships, is off to another fast start.
</P>
<P>
   The 184-pound sophomore cruised in both of his opening matches
Thursday. He led 19-6 before pinning Adam Schaaf of Millersville in
the first round. In the second round, he beat Dax Pecaro of North
Carolina-Greensboro 21-6 -- a technical fall that improved his
career record to 76-0.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he was also top-seeded and had a 12-3 victory and a
pin the first day.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not worried about the streak at all,'' Sanderson said. ''I
haven't thought twice about it. I'm thinking about my next
opponent, my next takedown. Everyone here is a good wrestler, so
you can't overlook anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanderson's focus was evident in the second round, when he took
only five seconds to execute his first takedown. He took injury
time for a nagging ankle ailment in the third period while leading
18-6, but said it was nothing to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   Both of Sanderson's older brothers also won their first two
matches. Cody Sanderson, a senior and the No. 2 seed at 133 pounds,
beat Brad Wright of Ohio University 15-4 in the second round, and
Cole Sanderson, a junior and the No. 7 seed at 157 pounds, won two
narrow decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cody and Cole, they kind of take a lot out of me,'' Sanderson
said. ''I think I'm going to have to back off watching them so
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State, the only team other than Iowa to win the
championship the last eight years, held a comfortable lead after
the first day of the three-day meet. The Cowboys had 38 points and
a 4{-point lead over Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State, which last won the NCAAs in 1994, kept all 10
wrestlers in the meet. Seven made it to the championship bracket
and the other three remained alive in the consolation bracket.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a good day for us,'' coach John Smith said. ''The good
thing is we've still got all 10 in and we've got an opportunity to
continue to score points.''
</P>
<P>
   Iowa, No. 1 in the rankings, had nine wrestlers remaining with
six in the championship bracket. Iowa State was third with 30
points and had eight wrestlers remaining, six in the championship
bracket.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota was fourth with 28 points and eight wrestlers
remaining, followed by Oklahoma (25), Illinois (22) and Michigan
State (22).
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State, which tied for fourth last year, had 20.5 points and
a half-point lead over Oklahoma State after the first session.
</P>
<P>
   Six wrestlers entered the tournament undefeated, and five made
it through the first two rounds. Eric Juergens (133) and defending
champion T.J. Williams (157) of Iowa, Byron Tucker (174) of
Oklahoma, Iowa State heavyweight Trent Hynek and Sanderson all won.
</P>
<P>
   Williams won two matches by a combined 29-9 and Juergens had two
pins. Tucker won 14-3 and 21-9. Hynek won his first-round match by
technical fall but struggled in the second round, beating Chris
Miller of Brigham Young 3-2 in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Heavyweight Antonio Garay of Boston College, who had been 13-0
and the sixth seed, lost 10-6 in the first round to Russ Davie of
Cleveland State.
</P>
<P>
   Other top-seeded wrestlers generally had an easy go of it. Jody
Strittmatter of Iowa beat Nathan Navarro of Oregon State 10-1 at
125 pounds and followed with a 7-2 decision over Jeremy Sluyter of
East Stroudsburg. Defending champion Doug Schwab of Iowa (141) beat
Grant Hoerr of Wisconsin 13-3, Tony Davis (149) of Northern Iowa
beat Brian Roskovich of Ohio State 12-2 and Mark Munoz (197) beat
Dan Bednar of Ohio University 13-5.
</P>
<P>
   ''Seeds really don't matter here,'' Strittmatter said. ''You've
got to perform. Everyone starts out 0-0.''
</P>
<P>
   The exception was Brock Lesnar of Minnesota, who picked up Bart
Johnson of Boise State at the start of his first-round match and
then struggled the rest of the way in a 4-2 decision. In the second
round, Lesnar pinned Shawn Laughlin of Lehigh in 2:18.

<HEADLINE> Tornado Survivors Hold Anniversary  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL PEARSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MURPHYSBORO, Ill. (AP) -- It was, simply, The Tornado. More than
a mile wide at times, it howled across three states in 3{ hours,
leaving 219 miles of destruction and 695 bodies in its wake.
</P>
<P>
   No one knew it was coming.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't even know the word tornado,'' said Mary Bell Melvin,
who survived the 1925 Tri-State Tornado, which struck Missouri,
Illinois and Indiana 75 years ago Saturday. ''To us, it was just a
storm.''
</P>
<P>
   To weather historians, the storm is considered a defining moment
in American meteorology -- the day the nation awoke to the need for
a tornado warning system, said Joseph Schaefer, director of the
National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   ''Something like this is not going to sneak up on us again. And
I think that's the moral here. This showed us what needed to be
done, and over 75 years, we've accomplished most of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Never since has a single tornado wrought so much damage.
</P>
<P>
   Storm survivors and historians will gather to mark the
anniversary Saturday in Murphysboro, where the storm killed 234
people and obliterated nearly 40 percent of the town.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very traumatic,'' said Melvin, who was a third-grader
at the time. ''There was looting going on. Everyone was frantically
trying to get what help they could. It really didn't settle down
for a long time afterward, and Murphysboro has really never fully
recovered from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other communities never recovered at all. The small settlements
of Parrish, Ill., and Griffin, Ind., were destroyed, said Peter
Felknor, author of ''The Tri-State Tornado: The Story of America's
Greatest Tornado Disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There was absolutely nothing left. There's not even
foundations. Even a lot of the debris was carried away. It just
looked like something that was just absolutely scrubbed clean,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The tornado -- one of the longest, fastest and widest on record --
touched down near Ellington, Mo., at about 1 p.m. on a day in which
the forecast called for rain and shifting winds, but nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   After killing 11 Missourians, the twister crossed the
Mississippi River and obliterated the small community of Gorham,
Ill., killing 34 people.
</P>
<P>
   According to survivor accounts, the storm was so large and so
low to the ground, no one recognized it as a tornado until it was
too late.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was so big, it was so nasty, it just looked like a cloud
eating the ground as it went along,'' Schaefer said.
</P>
<P>
   In the next 40 minutes, it would kill 541 people as it tore
through Murphysboro, De Soto, Hurst-Bush, and West Frankfort before
moving on to the farm fields of rural southeastern Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   More than 600 people were dead by the time the storm and its 300
mph winds crossed into Indiana, erased the town of Griffin, churned
up 85 farms and destroyed half of Princeton. At least 71 died in
Indiana. All told, 2,027 people were injured. Property damage
estimates reached $16.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   More than 800 people died in an 1884 tornado outbreak, but that
storm involved a cluster of tornadoes in several states. A 1974
cluster killed more than 300 people in 13 states.
</P>
<P>
   The 1925 storm nudged forecasters toward developing tornado
warning systems.
</P>
<P>
   It still took a long time.
</P>
<P>
   The military led the effort during World War II, setting up
spotter networks around its bases in tornado-prone areas. The first
tornado forecast was issued by the Air Force at Tinker Air Force
Base in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Government forecasters began issuing tornado watches and
warnings in 1952, but radar did not appear on the scene until the
late 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, improved radar, a network of weather-warning radio
stations and reliance on media reports have helped increase the
warning time for approaching tornadoes from virtually nothing
before World War II to 12 minutes today.
</P>
<P>
   That has helped reduce the death rate from tornadoes from 1.1
deaths per million people through 1925 to 0.1 deaths per million in
1998, according to the weather service. About 1,200 tornadoes were
reported last year -- none of them like the 1925 storm.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a storm that some say comes along once in a thousand
years,'' said National Weather Service forecaster Rick Shanklin in
Paducah, Ky. ''It is a very rare storm. Fortunately.''

<HEADLINE> Bush, NRA Differ on Clinton Remarks  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- George W. Bush, in a rare disagreement
with the National Rifle Association, said Thursday a top official
of the gun lobby had ''gone too far'' by accusing President Clinton
of having ''blood on his hands'' for not enforcing gun-control
laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor, a longtime gun-rights supporter now on his
way to the Republican presidential nomination, said at a campaign
stop: ''There's ways to debate the issue without casting aspersions
on the president like that. I just think they've gone too far.''
</P>
<P>
   After a bitter primary campaign in which Bush aligned himself
with conservative interest groups, he is seeking to move back
toward the political center for the general election. Gun control
is a popular issue among independent-minded voters, particularly
suburban women, who are being courted by both Bush and Democrat Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore, Bush's Democratic presidential opponent,
says the Texas governor does the bidding of the gun lobby, an
allegation Bush strongly rejects.
</P>
<P>
   And in an interview appearing in Friday editions of USA Today,
Gore called upon Bush to join him in backing pending federal
legislation to require mandatory child-safety trigger locks for new
firearms, end a loophole that exempts purchasers of guns at gun
shows from background checks and ban cheap handguns known as
Saturday Night Specials.
</P>
<P>
   Bush favors instant background checks on gun buyers and federal
legislation to extend the checks to private gun shows. He also said
he would sign legislation requiring that guns be sold with trigger
locks, but not mandate that they be used because the law would be
unenforceable.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Thursday, in response to a question about his own
relationship with the NRA, ''I'm distancing myself from accusing
the president of what was said. I just don't agree with that point
of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spoke after the NRA's executive vice president, Wayne
LaPierre, suggested Clinton shared the blame for the murder of a
basketball coach because of lax follow-up on background checks
under the Brady gun law. The president turned that aside and said
he will press Congress for more money to go after gun law
violators.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's truly ironic that the NRA is now criticizing us for not
throwing everybody in jail that fails a Brady background check,''
Clinton told reporters. ''If it had been up to them, we wouldn't be
doing these background checks.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spoke up, too, saying the NRA should ''allow its
legislative lackies'' to let Congress move ahead toward stricter
gun control. He said there was ''outrage felt by the American
people that nothing is being done by the Congress even in the face
of horrific tragedies.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than Bush, Republican leaders for the most part have
stayed out of the most recent fray. Asked about LaPierre's remarks
this week, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, would say
only, ''They're not comments I would have made.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted last year to institute 72-hour background
checks on gun show sales, but the House rejected that provision in
favor of a 24-hour wait, and gun control has been on the back
burner since then.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators from the House and Senate are supposed to resolve
differences between the two bills, which also contain a number of
other provisions. On Wednesday, the House agreed, on a non-binding
vote of 218-205, to urge a meeting within two weeks to resume work
on the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA, meanwhile, challenged Clinton to institute ''zero
tolerance'' for felons who try to buy guns, saying that alone would
prompt local authorities to crack down.
</P>
<P>
   ''State, local and county prosecutors all take a cue, in terms
of priorities, from the White House and from Bill Clinton's Justice
Department,'' said NRA spokesman Bill Powers. ''He has the power
right now to set the tone. He simply lacks the will to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre's comments concerned Ricky Byrdsong, the former
Northwestern University basketball coach who was shot to death last
summer by Benjamin Smith, a white supremacist who earlier had
failed to pass a Brady background check but was not arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Powers said the background check itself alerted federal
authorities that Smith was trying to obtain a gun. He said federal
prosecutors did not pursue the matter because of a policy of
''lackadaisical leniency'' that emanates from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said federal officials were
not aware of the killer's background check until six days after
Byrdsong's death. Illinois, where Byrdsong was shot, is one of 26
states in which state lawmen do the Brady background checks; the
FBI does them for 24 states.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would not get into ''a personal spat with Mr.
LaPierre about tactics I don't think any American appreciates and
that any American can see through.'' On enforcement, he said
Attorney General Janet Reno has tried to increase federal gun
prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said Thursday that federal prosecutors have tried to devote
their resources to pursuing drug traffickers, street gangs and
''major violence-producing organizations.'' She said that as
violent crime has begun to decline, federal officials have focused
more on illegal gun possessions and sales.
</P>
<P>
   Combined federal and state gun-crime convictions have been
rising, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the whole gun debate would change if he were
president.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to support instant background checks and legislation
requiring that guns be sold with trigger locks, he favors allowing
law-abiding citizens to have guns to protect their lives, families
and property. He has signed concealed weapons legislation in Texas
and even amended it to allow carrying guns into churches.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Bush favors development of a ''smart gun'' that can
only be fired when the hand holding it matches that of its owner.

<HEADLINE> Wisconsin 66, Fresno St. 56  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Jerry Tarkanian's return to the NCAA
tournament after a nine-year absence didn't last long.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Bryant scored 21 points, including four consecutive
3-pointers from the left corner, as No. 8 seed Wisconsin beat
ninth-seeded Fresno State 66-56 on Thursday night in the West
Regional.
</P>
<P>
   Tarkanian, the subject of decades-long investigations by the
NCAA, had been away since 1991 when UNLV reached the Final Four,
capping 16 trips to the tournament for him with the Runnin' Rebels.
</P>
<P>
   It took five years and four straight trips to the lesser NIT for
Tarkanian to get his alma mater of Fresno State into the NCAA
tournament. Along the way, there were embarrassing player
suspensions and arrests.
</P>
<P>
   The Badgers (19-13) beat the Bulldogs (24-10) for the third time
in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Fresno State's Courtney Alexander, the nation's leading scorer
with a 25.3 average, was held to 11.
</P>
<P>
   A pro-Fresno State crowd had much to cheer about early in the
second half when the Bulldogs built a seven-point lead on
consecutive 3-pointers by Demetrius Porter and Terrance Roberson,
who led the Bulldogs with 19 points.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his 16 appearances with UNLV in the tournament, the
sad-eyed Tarkanian didn't chomp on his trademark white towel. He
stood with his hands jammed in his pockets watching Alexander miss
two straight baskets as the Badgers regained the lead midway
through the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin Ely dunked to put the Bulldogs ahead 44-38 before the
ever-patient Badgers milked the shot clock in pursuit of a high
percentage shot. Their slowdown paid off with 14 straight points
for a 52-44 lead with 6:12 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Duany started the run with his fourth 3-pointer of the game.
Kelley, a two-time Big Ten defensive player of the year, stole the
ball and scored on a layup in between inside baskets by Kowske.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs went 7:26 without a basket until Alexander hit a
jumper that drew them within six.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Bryant had found a favorite spot in the left corner and
hit four consecutive 3-pointers, pushing Wisconsin's lead to 61-46
with 4:31 remaining. His shooting was part of a 26-2 run that broke
open what had been a defensive battle.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs came in averaging 83.1 points with their
pressure-oriented, uptempo style. But Wisconsin, which limited
opponents to an average of 56 points in the regular season, stuck
to its deliberate style and Fresno State never tried to get the
Badgers running.
